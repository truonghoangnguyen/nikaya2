### AN 10.115 Bad Principles (3rd)  *Tatiyaadhammasutta*

"Mendicants, you should know bad principles and good principles. And you
should know bad results and good results. Knowing these things, your
practice should follow the good principles with good results."

That is what the Buddha said. When he had spoken, the Holy One got up
from his seat and entered his dwelling.

Soon after the Buddha left, those mendicants considered, "The Buddha
gave this brief summary recital, then entered his dwelling without
explaining the meaning in detail. Who can explain in detail the meaning
of this brief summary recital given by the Buddha?"

Then they considered, "This Venerable Ānanda is praised by the Buddha
and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions. He is capable of
explaining in detail the meaning of this brief summary recital given by
the Buddha. Let's go to him, and ask him about this matter. As he
answers, so we'll remember it."

Then those mendicants went to Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to
one side. They told him what had happened, and said, "May Venerable
Ānanda please explain this."

"Reverends, suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. And while
wandering in search of heartwood he'd come across a large tree standing
with heartwood. But he'd pass over the roots and trunk, imagining that
the heartwood should be sought in the branches and leaves. Such is the
consequence for the venerables. Though you were face to face with the
Buddha, you overlooked him, imagining that you should ask me about this
matter. For he is the Buddha, the one who knows and sees. He is vision,
he is knowledge, he is the manifestation of principle, he is the
manifestation of divinity. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the
elucidator of meaning, the bestower of freedom from death, the lord of
truth, the Realized One. That was the time to approach the Buddha and
ask about this matter. You should have remembered it in line with the
Buddha's answer."

"Certainly he is the Buddha, the one who knows and sees. He is vision,
he is knowledge, he is the manifestation of principle, he is the
manifestation of divinity. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the
elucidator of meaning, the bestower of freedom from death, the lord of
truth, the Realized One. That was the time to approach the Buddha and
ask about this matter. We should have remembered it in line with the
Buddha's answer. Still, Venerable Ānanda is praised by the Buddha and
esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions. You are capable of
explaining in detail the meaning of this brief summary recital given by
the Buddha. Please explain this, if it's no trouble."

"Then listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, reverend," they replied. Ānanda said this:

"Reverends, the Buddha gave this brief summary recital, then entered his
dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail: 'You should know bad
principles and good principles. And you should know bad results and good
results. Knowing these things, your practice should follow the good
principles with good results.'

So what are bad principles? What are good principles? What are bad
results? And what are good results?

Wrong view is a bad principle. Right view is a good principle. And the
many bad, unskillful qualities produced by wrong view are bad results.
And the many skillful qualities fully developed because of right view
are good results.

Wrong thought is a bad principle. Right thought is a good principle. ...
Wrong speech is a bad principle. Right speech is a good principle. ...
Wrong action is a bad principle. Right action is a good principle. ...
Wrong livelihood is a bad principle. Right livelihood is a good
principle. ... Wrong effort is a bad principle. Right effort is a good
principle. ... Wrong mindfulness is a bad principle. Right mindfulness
is a good principle. ... Wrong immersion is a bad principle. Right
immersion is a good principle. ... Wrong knowledge is a bad principle.
Right knowledge is a good principle. ...

Wrong freedom is a bad principle. Right freedom is a good principle. And
the many bad, unskillful qualities produced by wrong freedom are bad
results. And the many skillful qualities fully developed because of
right freedom are good results.

The Buddha gave this brief summary recital, then entered his dwelling
without explaining the meaning in detail: 'You should know bad
principles and good principles ... and practice accordingly.' And this
is how I understand the detailed meaning of this summary recital. If you
wish, you may go to the Buddha and ask him about this. You should
remember it in line with the Buddha's answer."

"Yes, reverend," said those mendicants, approving and agreeing with what
Ānanda said. Then they rose from their seats and went to the Buddha,
bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then they
said:

"Sir, we went to Ānanda and asked him about this matter. And Ānanda
clearly explained the meaning to us in this manner, with these words and
phrases."

"Good, good, mendicants! Ānanda is astute, he has great wisdom. If you
came to me and asked this question, I would answer it in exactly the
same way as Ānanda. That is what it means, and that's how you should
remember it."

### AN 10.116 With Ajita  *Ajitasutta*

Then the wanderer Ajita went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings
with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat
down to one side and said to the Buddha, "Mister Gotama, we have a
spiritual companion called 'Astute'. He has worked out around five
hundred arguments by which followers of other religions will know when
they've been refuted."

Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, "Mendicants, do you remember
this Astute's points?"

"Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! Let the Buddha
speak and the mendicants will remember it."

"Well then, mendicants, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, take a certain person who rebuts and quashes unprincipled
statements with unprincipled statements. This delights an unprincipled
assembly, who make a dreadful racket: 'He is truly astute! He is truly
astute!'

Another person rebuts and quashes principled statements with
unprincipled statements. This delights an unprincipled assembly, who
make a dreadful racket: 'He is truly astute! He is truly astute!'

Another person rebuts and quashes principled and unprincipled statements
with unprincipled statements. This delights an unprincipled assembly,
who make a dreadful racket: 'He is truly astute! He is truly astute!'

Mendicants, you should know bad principles and good principles. And you
should know bad results and good results. Knowing these things, your
practice should follow the good principles with good results.

So what are bad principles? What are good principles? What are bad
results? And what are good results? Wrong view is a bad principle. Right
view is a good principle. And the many bad, unskillful qualities
produced by wrong view are bad results. And the many skillful qualities
fully developed because of right view are good results.

Wrong thought is a bad principle. Right thought is a good principle. ...
Wrong speech is a bad principle. Right speech is a good principle. ...
Wrong action is a bad principle. Right action is a good principle. ...
Wrong livelihood is a bad principle. Right livelihood is a good
principle. ... Wrong effort is a bad principle. Right effort is a good
principle. ... Wrong mindfulness is a bad principle. Right mindfulness
is a good principle. ... Wrong immersion is a bad principle. Right
immersion is a good principle. ... Wrong knowledge is a bad principle.
Right knowledge is a good principle. ...

Wrong freedom is a bad principle. Right freedom is a good principle. And
the many bad, unskillful qualities produced by wrong freedom are bad
results. And the many skillful qualities fully developed because of
right freedom are good results.

'You should know bad principles and good principles. And you should know
bad results and good results. Knowing these things, your practice should
follow the good principles with good results.' That's what I said, and
this is why I said it."

### AN 10.117 With Saṅgārava  *Saṅgāravasutta*

Then Saṅgārava the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and
exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation
were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:

"Mister Gotama, what is the near shore? And what is the far shore?"

"Wrong view is the near shore, brahmin, and right view is the far shore.
Wrong thought is the near shore, and right thought is the far shore.
Wrong speech is the near shore, and right speech is the far shore. Wrong
action is the near shore, and right action is the far shore. Wrong
livelihood is the near shore, and right livelihood is the far shore.
Wrong effort is the near shore, and right effort is the far shore. Wrong
mindfulness is the near shore, and right mindfulness is the far shore.
Wrong immersion is the near shore, and right immersion is the far shore.
Wrong knowledge is the near shore, and right knowledge is the far shore.
Wrong freedom is the near shore, and right freedom is the far shore.
This is the near shore, and this is the far shore.

> Few are those among humans\
> who cross to the far shore.\
> The rest just run around\
> on the near shore.
>
> When the teaching is well explained,\
> those who practice accordingly\
> are the ones who will cross over\
> Death's dominion so hard to pass.
>
> Rid of dark qualities,\
> an astute person should develop the bright.\
> Leaving home behind\
> for the seclusion so hard to enjoy,
>
> find delight there,\
> having left behind sensual pleasures.\
> With no possessions, an astute person\
> would cleanse themselves of mental corruptions.
>
> Those whose minds are rightly developed\
> in the awakening factors;\
> who, letting go of attachments,\
> delight in not grasping:\
> with defilements ended, brilliant,\
> they are quenched in this world."

<!--pg-->
### AN 10.118 The Near Shore  *Orimatīrasutta*

"Mendicants, I will teach you the near shore and the far shore. Listen
and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"And what, mendicants, is the near shore? What is the far shore? Wrong
view is the near shore, and right view is the far shore. ... Wrong
freedom is the near shore, and right freedom is the far shore. This is
the near shore, and this is the far shore.

> Few are those among humans\
> who cross to the far shore.\
> The rest just run\

>
> When the teaching is well explained,\

### AN 10.119 The Ceremony of Descent (1st)  *Paṭhamapaccorohaṇīsutta*

Now, at that time it was the sabbath. The brahmin Jānussoṇi
had bathed his head and dressed in a new pair of linen robes. Holding a
handful of fresh grass, he stood to one side not far from the Buddha.

The Buddha saw him, and said, "Brahmin, why have you bathed your head
and dressed in a new pair of linen robes? Why are you standing to one
side holding a handful of fresh grass? What's going on today with the
brahmin clan?"

"Mister Gotama, today is the ceremony of descent for the brahmin clan."

"But how do the brahmins observe the ceremony of descent?"

"Well, Mister Gotama, on the sabbath the brahmins bathe their heads and
dress in a new pair of linen robes. They make a heap of fresh cow dung
and spread it with green grass. Then they make their beds between the
boundary and the fire chamber. That night they rise three times and
worship the fire with joined palms: 'We descend, lord! We descend,
lord!' And they serve the fire with abundant ghee, oil, and butter. And
when the night has passed they serve the brahmins with delicious fresh
and cooked foods. That's how the brahmins observe the ceremony of
descent."

"The ceremony of descent observed by the brahmins is quite different
from that observed in the training of the Noble One."

"But Mister Gotama, how is the ceremony of descent observed in the
training of the Noble One? Mister Gotama, please teach me this."

"Well then, brahmin, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes sir," Jānussoṇi replied. The Buddha said this:

"It's when a noble disciple reflects: 'Wrong view has a bad result in
both this life and the next.' Reflecting like this, they give up wrong
view, they descend from wrong view.

'Wrong thought has a bad result in both this life and the next.'
Reflecting like this, they give up wrong thought, they descend from
wrong thought.

'Wrong speech has a bad result in both this life and the next.'
Reflecting like this, they give up wrong speech, they descend from wrong
speech.

'Wrong action has a bad result in both this life and the next.'
Reflecting like this, they give up wrong action, they descend from wrong
action.

'Wrong livelihood has a bad result in both this life and the next.'
Reflecting like this, they give up wrong livelihood, they descend from
wrong livelihood.

'Wrong effort has a bad result in both this life and the next.'
Reflecting like this, they give up wrong effort, they descend from wrong
effort.

'Wrong mindfulness has a bad result in both this life and the next.'
Reflecting like this, they give up wrong mindfulness, they descend from
wrong mindfulness.

'Wrong immersion has a bad result in both this life and the next.'
Reflecting like this, they give up wrong immersion, they descend from
wrong immersion.

'Wrong knowledge has a bad result in both this life and the next.'
Reflecting like this, they give up wrong knowledge, they descend from
wrong knowledge.

'Wrong freedom has a bad result in both this life and the next.'
Reflecting like this, they give up wrong freedom, they descend from
wrong freedom. This is the ceremony of descent in the training of the
Noble One."

"The ceremony of descent observed by the brahmins is quite different
from that observed in the training of the Noble One. And, Mister Gotama,
the ceremony of descent observed by the brahmins is not worth a
sixteenth part of a master of the ceremony of descent observed in the
training of the Noble One. Excellent, Mister Gotama! ... From this day
forth, may Mister Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for
refuge for life."

### AN 10.120 The Ceremony of Descent (2nd)  *Dutiyapaccorohaṇīsutta*

"Mendicants, I will teach you the noble descent. Listen and apply your
mind well, I will speak. ... And what is the noble descent? It's when a
noble disciple reflects: 'Wrong view has a bad result in both this life
and the next.' Reflecting like this, they give up wrong view, they
descend from wrong view. 'Wrong thought has a bad result ...' ... 'Wrong
speech ...' ... 'Wrong action ...' ... 'Wrong livelihood ...' ... 'Wrong
effort ...' ... 'Wrong mindfulness ...' ... 'Wrong immersion ...' ...
'Wrong knowledge ...' ... 'Wrong freedom has a bad result in both this
life and the next.' Reflecting like this, they give up wrong freedom,
they descend from wrong freedom. This is called the noble descent."

### AN 10.121 Forerunner  *Pubbaṅgamasutta*

"Mendicants, the dawn is the forerunner and precursor of the sunrise. In
the same way right view is the forerunner and precursor of skillful
qualities. Right view gives rise to right thought. Right thought gives
rise to right speech. Right speech gives rise to right action. Right
action gives rise to right livelihood. Right livelihood gives rise to
right effort. Right effort gives rise to right mindfulness. Right
mindfulness gives rise to right immersion. Right immersion gives rise to
right knowledge. Right knowledge gives rise to right freedom."

<!--pg-->
### AN 10.122 The Ending of Defilements  *Āsavakkhayasutta*

"Mendicants, these ten things, when developed and cultivated, lead to
the ending of defilements. What ten? Right view, right thought, right
speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,
right immersion, right knowledge, and right freedom. These ten things,
when developed and cultivated, lead to the ending of defilements."
