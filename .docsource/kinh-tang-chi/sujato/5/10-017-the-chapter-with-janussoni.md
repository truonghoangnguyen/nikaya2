# The Chapter with Jānussoṇi

### AN 10.167 The Brahmin Ceremony of Descent  *Brāhmaṇapaccorohaṇīsutta*

Now, at that time it was the sabbath. The brahmin Jānussoṇi
had bathed his head and dressed in a new pair of linen robes. Holding a
handful of fresh grass, he stood to one side not far from the Buddha.

The Buddha saw him, and said, "Brahmin, why have you bathed your head
and dressed in a new pair of linen robes? Why are you standing to one
side holding a handful of fresh grass? What's going on today with the
brahmin clan?"

"Mister Gotama, today is the ceremony of descent for the brahmin clan."

"But how do the brahmins observe the ceremony of descent?"

"Well, Mister Gotama, on the sabbath the brahmins bathe their heads and
dress in a new pair of linen robes. They make a heap of fresh cow dung
and spread it with green grass. Then they make their beds between the
boundary and the fire chamber. That night they rise three times and
worship the fire with joined palms: 'We descend, lord! We descend,
lord!' And they serve the fire with abundant ghee, oil, and butter. And
when the night has passed they serve the brahmins with delicious fresh
and cooked foods. That's how the brahmins observe the ceremony of
descent."

"The ceremony of descent observed by the brahmins is quite different
from that observed in the training of the Noble One."

"But Mister Gotama, how is the ceremony of descent observed in the
training of the Noble One? Mister Gotama, please teach me this."

"Well then, brahmin, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes sir," Jānussoṇi replied. The Buddha said this:

"It's when a noble disciple reflects: 'Killing living creatures has a
bad result in the present life and in lives to come.' Reflecting like
this, they give up killing living creatures, they descend from killing
living creatures.

... 'Stealing has a bad result in the present life and in lives to
come.' Reflecting like this, they give up stealing, they descend from
stealing.

... 'Sexual misconduct has a bad result in the present life and in lives
to come.' Reflecting like this, they give up sexual misconduct, they
descend from sexual misconduct.

... 'Lying has a bad result in the present life and in lives to come.'
Reflecting like this, they give up lying, they descend from lying.

... 'Divisive speech has a bad result in the present life and in lives
to come.' Reflecting like this, they give up divisive speech, they
descend from divisive speech.

... 'Harsh speech has a bad result in the present life and in lives to
come.' Reflecting like this, they give up harsh speech, they descend
from harsh speech.

... 'Talking nonsense has a bad result in the present life and in lives
to come.' Reflecting like this, they give up talking nonsense, they
descend from talking nonsense.

... 'Covetousness has a bad result in the present life and in lives to
come.' Reflecting like this, they give up covetousness, they descend
from covetousness.

... 'Ill will has a bad result in the present life and in lives to
come.' Reflecting like this, they give up ill will, they descend from
ill will.

'Wrong view has a bad result in the present life and in lives to come.'
Reflecting like this, they give up wrong view, they descend from wrong
view. This is the ceremony of descent in the training of the Noble One."

"The ceremony of descent observed by the brahmins is quite different
from that observed in the training of the Noble One. And, Mister Gotama,
the ceremony of descent observed by the brahmins is not worth a
sixteenth part of the ceremony of descent observed in the training of
the Noble One. Excellent, Mister Gotama, excellent! ... From this day
forth, may Mister Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for
refuge for life."

### AN 10.168 The Noble Descent  *Ariyapaccorohaṇīsutta*

"Mendicants, I will teach you the noble descent. Listen and apply your
mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"And what, mendicants, is the noble descent? It's when a noble disciple
reflects: 'Killing living creatures has a bad result in the present life
and in lives to come.' Reflecting like this, they give up killing living
creatures, they descend from killing living creatures.

... 'Stealing has a bad result in the present life and in lives to
come.' Reflecting like this, they give up stealing, they descend from
stealing.

... 'Sexual misconduct has a bad result ...' ... they descend from
sexual misconduct.

... 'Lying has a bad result ...' ... they descend from lying.

... 'Divisive speech has a bad result ...' ... they descend from
divisive speech.

... 'Harsh speech has a bad result ...' ... they descend from harsh
speech.

... 'Talking nonsense has a bad result ...' ... they descend from
talking nonsense.

... 'Covetousness has a bad result ...' ... they descend from
covetousness.

... 'Ill will has a bad result ...' ... they descend from ill will.

... 'Wrong view has a bad result both in the present life and in lives
to come.' Reflecting like this, they give up wrong view, they descend
from wrong view. This is called the noble descent."

### AN 10.169 With Saṅgārava  *Saṅgāravasutta*

Then Saṅgārava the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and
exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation
were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:

"Mister Gotama, what is the near shore? And what is the far shore?"

"Killing living creatures is the near shore, brahmin, and not killing
living creatures is the far shore. Stealing is the near shore, and not
stealing is the far shore. Sexual misconduct is the near shore, and
avoiding sexual misconduct is the far shore. Lying is the near shore,
and not lying is the far shore. Divisive speech is the near shore, and
avoiding divisive speech is the far shore. Harsh speech is the near
shore, and avoiding harsh speech is the far shore. Talking nonsense is
the near shore, and avoiding talking nonsense is the far shore.
Covetousness is the near shore, and contentment is the far shore. Ill
will is the near shore, and good will is the far shore. Wrong view is
the near shore, and right view is the far shore. This is the near shore,
and this is the far shore.

> Few are those among humans\
> who cross to the far shore.\
> The rest just run\
> around on the near shore.
>
> When the teaching is well explained,\
> those who practice accordingly\
> are the ones who will cross over\

> Rid of dark qualities,\

> Leaving home behind\
> for the seclusion so hard to enjoy,
>
> you should try to find delight there,\
> having left behind sensual pleasures.\
> With no possessions, an astute person\
> should cleanse themselves of mental corruptions.
>
> And those whose minds are rightly developed\
> in the awakening factors;\
> letting go of attachments,\
> they delight in not grasping.\
> With defilements ended, brilliant,\
> they are quenched in this world."

### AN 10.170 The Near Shore  *Orimasutta*

"Mendicants, I will teach you the near shore and the far shore. Listen
and apply your mind well, I will speak. ... And what, mendicants, is the
near shore? What is the far shore? Killing living creatures is the near
shore, mendicants, and not killing living creatures is the far shore.
Stealing is the near shore, and not stealing is the far shore. Sexual
misconduct is the near shore, and avoiding sexual misconduct is the far
shore. Lying is the near shore, and not lying is the far shore. Divisive
speech is the near shore, and avoiding divisive speech is the far shore.
Harsh speech is the near shore, and avoiding harsh speech is the far
shore. Talking nonsense is the near shore, and avoiding talking nonsense
is the far shore. Covetousness is the near shore, and contentment is the
far shore. Ill will is the near shore, and good will is the far shore.
Wrong view is the near shore, and right view is the far shore. This is
the near shore, and this is the far shore.

### AN 10.171 Bad Principles (1st)  *Paṭhamaadhammasutta*

"Mendicants, you should know bad principles with bad results. And you
should know good principles with good results. Knowing these things,
your practice should follow the good principles with good results.

And what are bad principles with bad results? Killing living creatures,
stealing, and sexual misconduct; speech that's false, divisive, harsh,
or nonsensical; covetousness, ill will, and wrong view. These are called
bad principles with bad results.

And what are good principles with good results? Avoiding killing living
creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct; avoiding speech that's
false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; contentment, good will, and
right view. These are called good principles with good results.

'You should know bad principles with bad results. And you should know
good principles with good results. Knowing these things, your practice
should follow the good principles with good results.' That's what I
said, and this is why I said it."

<!--pg-->
### AN 10.172 Bad Principles (2nd)  *Dutiyaadhammasutta*

"Mendicants, you should know bad principles and good principles. And you
should know bad results and good results. Knowing these things, your
practice should follow the good principles with good results."

That is what the Buddha said. When he had spoken, the Holy One got up
from his seat and entered his dwelling.

Soon after the Buddha left, those mendicants considered, "The Buddha
gave this brief summary recital, then entered his dwelling without
explaining the meaning in detail. 'You should know bad principles and
good principles. And you should know bad results and good results.
Knowing these things, your practice should follow the good principles
with good results.' Who can explain in detail the meaning of this brief
summary recital given by the Buddha?"

Then those mendicants thought, "This Venerable Mahākaccāna
is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual
companions. He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this
brief summary recital given by the Buddha. Let's go to him, and ask him
about this matter. As he answers, so we'll remember it."

Then those mendicants went to Mahākaccāna, and exchanged
greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were
over, they sat down to one side. They told him what had happened, and
said, "May Venerable Mahākaccāna please explain this."

"Reverends, suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. And while
wandering in search of heartwood he'd come across a large tree standing
with heartwood. But he'd pass over the roots and trunk, imagining that
the heartwood should be sought in the branches and leaves. Such is the
consequence for the venerables. Though you were face to face with the
Buddha, you overlooked him, imagining that you should ask me about this
matter. For he is the Buddha, the one who knows and sees. He is vision,
he is knowledge, he is the manifestation of principle, he is the
manifestation of divinity. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the
elucidator of meaning, the bestower of freedom from death, the lord of
truth, the Realized One. That was the time to approach the Buddha and
ask about this matter. You should have remembered it in line with the
Buddha's answer."

"Certainly he is the Buddha, the one who knows and sees. He is vision,
he is knowledge, he is the manifestation of principle, he is the
manifestation of divinity. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the
elucidator of meaning, the bestower of freedom from death, the lord of
truth, the Realized One. That was the time to approach the Buddha and
ask about this matter. We should have remembered it in line with the
Buddha's answer. Still, Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by
the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions. He is
capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief summary
recital given by the Buddha. Please explain this, if it's no trouble."

"Well then, reverends, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, reverend," they replied. Mahākaccāna said this:

"Reverends, the Buddha gave this brief summary recital, then entered his
dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail: 'You should know bad
principles and good principles ... and practice accordingly.'

So what are bad principles? What are good principles? What are bad
results? And what are good results? Killing living creatures is a bad
principle. Not killing living creatures is a good principle. And the
many bad, unskillful qualities produced by killing living creatures are
bad results. And the many skillful qualities fully developed because of
not killing living creatures are good results.

Stealing is a bad principle. Not stealing is a good principle. And the
many bad, unskillful qualities produced by stealing are bad results. And
the many skillful qualities fully developed because of not stealing are

good principle. And the many bad, unskillful qualities produced by
sexual misconduct are bad results. And the many skillful qualities fully
developed because of avoiding sexual misconduct are good results.

Lying is a bad principle. Not lying is a good principle. And the many
bad, unskillful qualities produced by lying are bad results. And the
many skillful qualities fully developed because of not lying are good
results.

Divisive speech is a bad principle. Avoiding divisive speech is a good
principle. And the many bad, unskillful qualities produced by divisive
speech are bad results. And the many skillful qualities fully developed
because of avoiding divisive speech are good results.

Harsh speech is a bad principle. Avoiding harsh speech is a good
principle. And the many bad, unskillful qualities produced by harsh
speech are bad results. And the many skillful qualities fully developed
because of avoiding harsh speech are good results.

Talking nonsense is a bad principle. Avoiding talking nonsense is a good
principle. And the many bad, unskillful qualities produced by talking
nonsense are bad results. And the many skillful qualities fully
developed because of avoiding talking nonsense are good results.

Covetousness is a bad principle. Contentment is a good principle. And
the many bad, unskillful qualities produced by covetousness are bad
results. And the many skillful qualities fully developed because of
contentment are good results.

Ill will is a bad principle. Good will is a good principle. And the many
bad, unskillful qualities produced by ill will are bad results. And the
many skillful qualities fully developed because of good will are good
results.

Wrong view is a bad principle. Right view is a good principle. And the
many bad, unskillful qualities produced by wrong view are bad results.
And the many skillful qualities fully developed because of right view
are good results.

The Buddha gave this brief summary recital, then entered his dwelling
without explaining the meaning in detail: 'You should know bad
principles and good principles ... and practice accordingly.' And this
is how I understand the detailed meaning of this summary recital. If you
wish, you may go to the Buddha and ask him about this. You should
remember it in line with the Buddha's answer."

"Yes, reverend," said those mendicants, approving and agreeing with what
Mahākaccāna said. Then they rose from their seats and went
to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had
happened. Then they said:

"Sir, we went to Mahākaccāna and asked him about this
matter. And Mahākaccāna clearly explained the meaning to us
in this manner, with these words and phrases."

"Good, good, mendicants! Mahākaccāna is astute, he has
great wisdom. If you came to me and asked this question, I would answer
it in exactly the same way as Mahākaccāna. That is what it
means, and that's how you should remember it."

### AN 10.173 Bad Principles (3rd)  *Tatiyaadhammasutta*

"Mendicants, you should know bad principles and good principles. And you
should know bad results and good results. Knowing these things, your
practice should follow the good principles with good results.

So what are bad principles? What are good principles? What are bad
results? And what are good results? Killing living creatures is a bad
principle. Not killing living creatures is a good principle. And the
many bad, unskillful qualities produced by killing living creatures are
bad results. And the many skillful qualities fully developed because of
not killing living creatures are good results.

Stealing is a bad principle. Not stealing is a good principle. ...
Sexual misconduct is a bad principle. Avoiding sexual misconduct is a
good principle. ... Lying is a bad principle. Not lying is a good
principle. ... Divisive speech is a bad principle. Avoiding divisive
speech is a good principle. ... Harsh speech is a bad principle.
Avoiding harsh speech is a good principle. ... Talking nonsense is a bad
principle. Avoiding talking nonsense is a good principle. ...
Covetousness is a bad principle. Contentment is a good principle. ...
Ill will is a bad principle. Good will is a good principle. ...

Wrong view is a bad principle. Right view is a good principle. And the
many bad, unskillful qualities produced by wrong view are bad results.
And the many skillful qualities fully developed because of right view
are good results.

'You should know bad principles and good principles. And you should know
bad results and good results. Knowing these things, your practice should
follow the good principles with good results.' That's what I said, and
this is why I said it."

<!--pg-->
### AN 10.174 Sources of Deeds  *Kammanidānasutta*

"Mendicants, I say that killing living creatures is threefold: caused by
greed, hate, or delusion.

I say that stealing is threefold: caused by greed, hate, or delusion.

I say that sexual misconduct is threefold: caused by greed, hate, or
delusion.

I say that lying is threefold: caused by greed, hate, or delusion.

I say that divisive speech is threefold: caused by greed, hate, or
delusion.

I say that harsh speech is threefold: caused by greed, hate, or
delusion.

I say that talking nonsense is threefold: caused by greed, hate, or
delusion.

I say that covetousness is threefold: caused by greed, hate, or
delusion.

I say that ill will is threefold: caused by greed, hate, or delusion.

I say that wrong view is threefold: caused by greed, hate, or delusion.
And so greed, hate, and delusion are sources and origins for deeds. With
the ending of greed, hate, and delusion, the sources of deeds are
ended."

<!--pg-->
### AN 10.175 The Bypass  *Parikkamanasutta*

"Mendicants, this teaching provides a bypass, it doesn't lack a bypass.
And how does this teaching provide a bypass, not lacking a bypass? Not
killing living creatures bypasses killing living creatures. Not stealing
bypasses stealing. Avoiding sexual misconduct bypasses sexual
misconduct. Not lying bypasses lying. Avoiding divisive speech bypasses
divisive speech. Avoiding harsh speech bypasses harsh speech. Avoiding
talking nonsense bypasses talking nonsense. Contentment bypasses
covetousness. Good will bypasses ill will. Right view bypasses wrong
view. That's how this teaching provides a bypass, it doesn't lack a
bypass."

<!--pg-->
### AN 10.176 With Cunda  *Cundasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Pāvā in Cunda the smith's mango grove. Then Cunda the smith
went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to
him, "Cunda, whose purity do you believe in?"

"Sir, I believe in the purity advocated by the western brahmins draped
with moss who carry pitchers, serve the sacred flame, and immerse
themselves in water."

"But Cunda, what kind of purity do these western brahmins advocate?"

"The western brahmins encourage their disciples like this: 'Please, good
people, rising early you should stroke the earth from your bed. If you
don't stroke the earth, stroke fresh cow dung. If you don't stroke fresh
cow dung, stroke green grass. If you don't stroke green grass, serve the
sacred flame. If you don't serve the sacred flame, revere the sun with
joined palms. If you don't revere the sun with joined palms, immerse
yourself in water three times, including the evening.' The western
brahmins advocate this kind of purity."

"The purity advocated by the western brahmins is quite different from
that in the training of the Noble One."

"But what, sir, is purity in the training of the Noble One? Sir, please
teach me this."

"Well then, brahmin, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," Cunda replied. The Buddha said this:

"Cunda, impurity is threefold by way of body, fourfold by way of speech,
and threefold by way of mind.

And how is impurity threefold by way of body? It's when a certain person
kills living creatures. They're violent, bloody-handed, a hardened
killer, merciless to living beings.

They steal. With the intention to commit theft, they take the wealth or
belongings of others from village or wilderness.

They commit sexual misconduct. They have sexual relations with women who
have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister,
relatives, or clan as guardian. They have sexual relations with a woman
who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation
is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of
betrothal.

This is the threefold impurity by way of body.

And how is impurity fourfold by way of speech? It's when a certain
person lies. They're summoned to a council, an assembly, a family
meeting, a guild, or to the royal court, and asked to bear witness:
'Please, mister, say what you know.' Not knowing, they say 'I know.'
Knowing, they say 'I don't know.' Not seeing, they say 'I see.' And
seeing, they say 'I don't see.' So they deliberately lie for the sake of
themselves or another, or for some trivial worldly reason.

They speak divisively. They repeat in one place what they heard in
another so as to divide people against each other. And so they divide
those who are harmonious, supporting division, delighting in division,
loving division, speaking words that promote division.

They speak harshly. They use the kinds of words that are cruel, nasty,
hurtful, offensive, bordering on anger, not leading to immersion.

They talk nonsense. Their speech is untimely, and is neither factual nor
beneficial. It has nothing to do with the teaching or the training.
Their words have no value, and are untimely, unreasonable, rambling, and
pointless. This is the fourfold impurity by way of speech.

And how is impurity threefold by way of mind? It's when a certain person
is covetous. They covet the wealth and belongings of others: 'Oh, if
only their belongings were mine!'

They have ill will and malicious intentions: 'May these sentient beings
be killed, slaughtered, slain, destroyed, or annihilated!'

They have wrong view. Their perspective is distorted: 'There's no
meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There's no fruit or result
of good and bad deeds. There's no afterlife. There's no such thing as
mother and father, or beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there's
no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced,
and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own
insight.' This is the threefold impurity by way of mind.

These are the ten ways of doing unskillful deeds. When you have these
ten ways of doing unskillful deeds, then if you rise early, whether or
not you stroke the earth from your bed, you're still impure.

Whether or not you stroke fresh cow dung, you're still impure.

Whether or not you stroke green grass, you're still impure.

Whether or not you serve the sacred flame, you're still impure.

Whether or not you revere the sun with joined palms, you're still
impure.

Whether or not you immerse yourself in water three times, you're still
impure. Why is that? These ten ways of doing unskillful deeds are impure
and make things impure.

It's because of those who do these ten kinds of unskillful deeds that
hell, the animal realm, the ghost realm, or any other bad places are
found.

Cunda, purity is threefold by way of body, fourfold by way of speech,
and threefold by way of mind.

And how is purity threefold by way of body? It's when a certain person
gives up killing living creatures. They renounce the rod and the sword.
They're scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all living
beings.

They give up stealing. They don't, with the intention to commit theft,
take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness.

They give up sexual misconduct. They don't have sexual relations with
women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother,
sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. They don't have sexual relations
with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or
whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded
as a token of betrothal.

This is the threefold purity by way of body.

And how is purity fourfold by way of speech? It's when a certain person
gives up lying. They're summoned to a council, an assembly, a family
meeting, a guild, or to the royal court, and asked to bear witness:
'Please, mister, say what you know.' Not knowing, they say 'I don't
know.' Knowing, they say 'I know.' Not seeing, they say 'I don't see.'
And seeing, they say 'I see.' So they don't deliberately lie for the
sake of themselves or another, or for some trivial worldly reason.

They give up divisive speech. They don't repeat in one place what they
heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead,
they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in
harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.

They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that's mellow, pleasing
to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to
the people.

They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and
meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at
the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.

This is the fourfold purity by way of speech.

And how is purity threefold by way of mind? It's when a certain person
is content. They don't covet the wealth and belongings of others: 'Oh,
if only their belongings were mine!'

They have a kind heart and loving intentions: 'May these sentient beings
live free of enmity and ill will, untroubled and happy!'

They have right view, an undistorted perspective: 'There is meaning in
giving, sacrifice, and offerings. There are fruits and results of good
and bad deeds. There is an afterlife. There are such things as mother
and father, and beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there are
ascetics and brahmins who are rightly comported and rightly practiced,
and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own
insight.'

This is the threefold purity by way of mind.

These are the ten ways of doing skillful deeds. When you have these ten
ways of doing skillful deeds, then if you rise early, whether or not you
stroke the earth from your bed, you're still pure.

Whether or not you stroke fresh cow dung, you're still pure.

Whether or not you stroke green grass, you're still pure.

Whether or not you serve the sacred flame, you're still pure.

Whether or not you revere the sun with joined palms, you're still pure.

Whether or not you immerse yourself in water three times, you're still
pure. Why is that? These ten ways of doing skillful deeds are pure and
make things pure.

It's because of those who do these ten kinds of skillful deeds that
gods, humans, or any other good places are found."

When he said this, Cunda the smith said to the Buddha, "Excellent, sir!
Excellent! ... From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay
follower who has gone for refuge for life."

### AN 10.177 With Jānussoṇi  *Jāṇussoṇisutta*

Then the brahmin Jānussoṇi went up to the Buddha, and
exchanged greetings with him.

When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one
side and said to the Buddha, "We who are known as brahmins give gifts
and perform memorial rites for the dead: 'May this gift aid my departed
relatives and kin. May they partake of this gift.' But does this gift
really aid departed relatives and kin? Do they actually partake of it?"

"It aids them if the conditions are right, brahmin, but not if the
conditions are wrong."

"Then, Mister Gotama, what are the right and wrong conditions?"

"Brahmin, take someone who kills living creatures, steals, and commits
sexual misconduct. They use speech that's false, divisive, harsh, or
nonsensical. And they're covetous, malicious, with wrong view. When
their body breaks up, after death, they're reborn in hell. There they
survive feeding on the food of the hell beings. The conditions there are
wrong, so the gift does not aid the one who lives there.

Take someone else who kills living creatures ... and has wrong view.
When their body breaks up, after death, they're reborn in the animal
realm. There they survive feeding on the food of the beings in the
animal realm. The conditions there too are wrong, so the gift does not
aid the one who lives there.

Take someone else who doesn't kill living creatures, steal, commit
sexual misconduct, or use speech that's false, divisive, harsh, or
nonsensical. They're contented, kind-hearted, and have right view. When
their body breaks up, after death, they're reborn in the human realm.
There they survive feeding on human food. The conditions there too are
wrong, so the gift does not aid the one who lives there.

Take someone else who doesn't kill living creatures ... and has right
view. When their body breaks up, after death, they're reborn in the
company of the gods. There they survive feeding on the food of the gods.
The conditions there too are wrong, so the gift does not aid the one who
lives there.

Take someone else who kills living creatures ... and has wrong view.
When their body breaks up, after death, they're reborn in the ghost
realm. There they survive feeding on the food of the beings in the ghost
realm. Or else they survive feeding on what friends and colleagues,
relatives and kin provide them with from here. The conditions there are
right, so the gift aids the one who lives there."

"But Mister Gotama, who partakes of that gift if the departed relative
is not reborn in that place?"

"Other departed relatives reborn there will partake of that gift."

"But who partakes of the gift when neither that relative nor other
relatives have been reborn in that place?"

"It's impossible, brahmin, it cannot happen that that place is vacant of
departed relatives in all this long time. It's never fruitless for the
donor."

"Does Mister Gotama propose this even when the conditions are wrong?"

"I propose this even when the conditions are wrong. Take someone who
