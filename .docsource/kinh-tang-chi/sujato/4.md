## The Chapter on Wealth

### AN 7.1 Pleasing (1st)  *Paṭhamapiyasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, a mendicant with seven qualities is disliked and
disapproved by their spiritual companions, not respected or admired.
What seven? It's when a mendicant desires material things, honor, and
status. They lack conscience and prudence. They have corrupt wishes and
wrong view. A mendicant with these seven qualities is disliked and
disapproved by their spiritual companions, not respected or admired.

A mendicant with seven qualities is liked and approved by their
spiritual companions, respected and admired. What seven? It's when a
mendicant doesn't desire material things, honor, and status. They have
conscience and prudence. They have few desires and right view. A
mendicant with these seven qualities is liked and approved by their
spiritual companions, respected and admired."

### AN 7.3 Powers in Brief  *Saṁkhittabalasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. ... "Mendicants, there are these seven powers. What seven?
The powers of faith, energy, conscience, prudence, mindfulness,
immersion, and wisdom. These are the seven powers.

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.4 Powers in Detail  *Vitthatabalasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these seven powers. What seven? The powers of
faith, energy, conscience, prudence, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom.

And what is the power of faith? It's when a noble disciple has faith in
the Realized One's awakening: 'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully
awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of
the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods
and humans, awakened, blessed.' This is called the power of faith.

And what is the power of energy? It's when a noble disciple lives with
energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing
skillful qualities. They're strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off
when it comes to developing skillful qualities. This is called the power
of energy.

And what is the power of conscience? It's when a noble disciple has a
conscience. They're conscientious about bad conduct by way of body,
speech, and mind, and conscientious about acquiring any bad, unskillful
qualities. This is called the power of conscience.

And what is the power of prudence? It's when a noble disciple is
prudent. They're prudent when it comes to bad conduct by way of body,
speech, and mind, and prudent when it comes to the acquiring of any bad,
unskillful qualities. This is called the power of prudence.

And what is the power of mindfulness? It's when a noble disciple is
mindful. They have utmost mindfulness and alertness, and can remember
and recall what was said and done long ago. This is called the power of
mindfulness.

And what is the power of immersion? It's when a noble disciple, quite
secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities,
enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and
bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it
connected. ... Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness
and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without
pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. This is called
the power of immersion.

And what is the power of wisdom? It's when a noble disciple is wise.
They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble,
penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. This is
called the power of wisdom.

These are the seven powers.

> The powers are faith and energy,\
> conscience and prudence,\
> mindfulness and immersion,\
> and wisdom as the seventh power.\
> Empowered by these,\
> an astute mendicant lives happily.
>
> They should examine the teaching rationally,\

### AN 7.7 With Ugga  *Uggasutta*

Then Ugga the government chief minister went up to the Buddha, bowed,
sat down to one side, and said to him, "It's incredible, sir, it's
amazing! Migāra of Rohaṇa is so rich, so very
wealthy."

"But Ugga, how rich is he?"

"He has a hundred thousand gold coins, not to mention the silver coins!"

"Well, Ugga, that is wealth, I can't deny it. But fire, water, rulers,
thieves, and unloved heirs all take a share of that wealth. There are
these seven kinds of wealth that they can't take a share of. What seven?
The wealth of faith, ethics, conscience, prudence, learning, generosity,
and wisdom. There are these seven kinds of wealth that fire, water,

### AN 7.8 Fetters  *Saṁyojanasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these seven fetters. What seven? The fetters of
attraction, repulsion, views, doubt, conceit, desire to be reborn, and
ignorance. These are the seven fetters."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.9 Giving Up  *Pahānasutta*

"Mendicants, the spiritual life is lived to give up and cut out these
seven fetters. What seven? The fetters of attraction, repulsion, views,
doubt, conceit, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. The spiritual life
is lived to give up and cut out these seven fetters. When a mendicant
has given up the fetters of attraction, repulsion, views, doubt,
conceit, desire to be reborn, and ignorance---cut them off at the root,
made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so they are unable to
arise in the future---they're called a mendicant who has cut off
craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit has
made an end of suffering."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.10 Stinginess  *Macchariyasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these seven fetters. What seven? The fetters of
attraction, repulsion, views, doubt, conceit, jealousy, and stinginess.

## The Chapter on Tendencies

### AN 7.11 Underlying Tendencies (1st)  *Paṭhamaanusayasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these seven underlying tendencies. What seven?
The underlying tendencies of sensual desire, repulsion, views, doubt,

seven underlying tendencies. What seven? The underlying tendencies of
sensual desire, repulsion, views, doubt, conceit, desire to be reborn,

called a mendicant who has cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by
rightly comprehending conceit has made an end of suffering."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.13 A Family  *Kulasutta*

"Mendicants, visiting a family with seven factors is not worthwhile, or
if you've already arrived, sitting down is not worthwhile. What seven?
They don't politely rise, bow, or offer a seat. They hide what they
have. Even when they have much they give little. Even when they have
fine things they give coarse things. They give carelessly, not
carefully. Visiting a family with these seven factors is not worthwhile,
or if you've already arrived, sitting down is not worthwhile.

Visiting a family with seven factors is worthwhile, or if you've already
arrived, sitting down is worthwhile. What seven? They politely rise,
bow, and offer a seat. They don't hide what they have. When they have
much they give much. When they have refined things they give refined
things. They give carefully, not carelessly. Visiting a family with
these seven factors is worthwhile, or if you've already arrived, sitting
down is worthwhile."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.14 Persons  *Puggalasutta*

"Mendicants, these seven people are worthy of offerings dedicated to the
gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of
greeting with joined palms, and are the supreme field of merit for the
world. What seven? The one freed both ways, the one freed by wisdom, the
direct witness, the one attained to view, the one freed by faith, the
follower of teachings, and the follower by faith. These are the seven
people who are worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of
hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with
joined palms, and are the supreme field of merit for the world."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.15 A Simile With Water  *Udakūpamāsutta*

"Mendicants, these seven people found in the world are like those in
water.

What seven? One person sinks under once and stays under. One person
rises up then sinks under. One person rises up then stays put. One
person rises up then sees and discerns. One person rises up then crosses
over. One person rises up then finds a footing. One person has risen up,
crossed over, and gone beyond, and that brahmin stands on the shore.

And what kind of person sinks under once and stays under? It's the kind
of person who has exclusively dark, unskillful qualities. This kind of
person sinks under once and stays under.

And what kind of person rises up then sinks under? It's the kind of
person who, rising up, thinks: 'It's good to have faith, conscience,
prudence, energy, and wisdom regarding skillful qualities.' However
their faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom don't last or
grow, but dwindle away. This kind of person rises up then sinks under.

And what kind of person rises up then stays put? It's the kind of person
who, rising up, thinks: 'It's good to have faith, conscience, prudence,
energy, and wisdom regarding skillful qualities.' And their faith,
conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom lasts, neither dwindling nor
growing. This kind of person rises up then stays put.

And what kind of person rises up then sees and discerns? It's the kind
of person who, rising up, thinks: 'It's good to have faith, conscience,
prudence, energy, and wisdom regarding skillful qualities.' With the
ending of three fetters they're a stream-enterer, not liable to be
reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. This kind of person rises
up then sees and discerns.

And what kind of person rises up then crosses over? It's the kind of
person who, rising up, thinks: 'It's good to have faith, conscience,
prudence, energy, and wisdom regarding skillful qualities.' With the
ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion,
they're a once-returner. They come back to this world once only, then
make an end of suffering. This kind of person rises up then crosses
over.

And what kind of person rises up then finds a footing? It's the kind of
person who, rising up, thinks: 'It's good to have faith, conscience,
prudence, energy, and wisdom regarding skillful qualities.' With the
ending of the five lower fetters they're reborn spontaneously. They are
extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. This
kind of person rises up then finds a footing.

And what kind of person has risen up, crossed over, and gone beyond, a
brahmin who stands on the shore? It's the kind of person who, rising up,
thinks: 'It's good to have faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and
wisdom regarding skillful qualities.' They realize the undefiled freedom
of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having
realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
This kind of person has risen up, crossed over, and gone beyond, a
brahmin who stands on the shore.

These seven people found in the world are like those in water."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.16 Observing Impermanence  *Aniccānupassīsutta*

"Mendicants, these seven people are worthy of offerings dedicated to the
gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of
greeting with joined palms, and are the supreme field of merit for the
world. What seven?

First, take a person who meditates observing impermanence in all
conditions. They perceive impermanence and experience impermanence.
Constantly, continually, and without interruption, they apply the mind
and fathom with wisdom. They've realized the undefiled freedom of heart
and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it
with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. This is the
first person.

Next, take a person who meditates observing impermanence in all
conditions. Their defilements and their life come to an end at exactly
the same time. This is the second person.

Next, take a person who meditates observing impermanence in all
conditions. With the ending of the five lower fetters they're
extinguished between one life and the next. ...

With the ending of the five lower fetters they're extinguished upon
landing. ...

With the ending of the five lower fetters they're extinguished without
extra effort. ...

With the ending of the five lower fetters they're extinguished with
extra effort. ...

With the ending of the five lower fetters they head upstream, going to
the Akaniṭṭha realm. This is the seventh person.

gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of
greeting with joined palms, and are the supreme field of merit for the
world."

"Mendicants, these seven people are worthy of offerings dedicated to the
gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of
greeting with joined palms, and are the supreme field of merit for the
world. What seven? First, take a person who meditates observing
suffering in all conditions. They perceive suffering and experience
suffering. Constantly, continually, and without interruption, they apply
the mind and fathom with wisdom. ..."

"First, take a person who meditates observing not-self in all things.
They perceive not-self and experience not-self. Constantly, continually,
and without interruption, they apply the mind and fathom with wisdom.
..."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.19 Extinguishment  *Nibbānasutta*

"First, take a person who meditates observing the happiness in
extinguishment. They perceive happiness and experience happiness.
Constantly, continually, and without interruption, they apply the mind
and fathom with wisdom. They've realized the undefiled freedom of heart
and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it
with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. This is the
first person worthy of offerings.

Next, take a person who meditates observing the happiness in
extinguishment. They perceive happiness and experience happiness.
Constantly, continually, and without interruption, they apply the mind
and fathom with wisdom. Their defilements and their life come to an end
at exactly the same time. This is the second person.

gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of
greeting with joined palms, and are the supreme field of merit for the
world."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.20 Qualifications for Graduation  *Niddasavatthusutta*

"Mendicants, there are these seven qualifications for graduation. What
seven? It's when a mendicant has a keen enthusiasm to undertake the
training ... to examine the teachings ... to get rid of desires ... for
retreat ... to rouse up energy ... for mindfulness and alertness ... to
penetrate theoretically. And they don't lose these desires in the
future. These are the seven qualifications for graduation."

## The Chapter on the Vajji Seven

### AN 7.21 At Sārandada  *Sārandadasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Vesālī, at the Sārandada Tree-shrine. Then
several Licchavis went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,
and the Buddha said to these Licchavis:

"Licchavis, I will teach you these seven principles that prevent
decline. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"And what are the seven principles that prevent decline? As long as the
Vajjis meet frequently and have many meetings, they can expect growth,
not decline.

As long as the Vajjis meet in harmony, leave in harmony, and carry on
their business in harmony, they can expect growth, not decline.

As long as the Vajjis don't make new decrees or abolish existing
decrees, but undertake and follow the ancient Vajjian traditions as they
have been decreed, they can expect growth, not decline.

As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate Vajjian
elders, and think them worth listening to, they can expect growth, not
decline.

As long as the Vajjis don't forcibly abduct the women or girls of the
clans and make them live with them, they can expect growth, not decline.

As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Vajjian
shrines, whether inner or outer, not neglecting the proper
spirit-offerings that were given and made in the past, they can expect
growth, not decline.

As long as the Vajjis organize proper protection, shelter, and security
for perfected ones, so that more perfected ones might come to the realm
and those already here may live in comfort, they can expect growth, not
decline.

As long as these seven principles that prevent decline last among the
Vajjis, and as long as the Vajjis are seen following them, they can
expect growth, not decline."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.22 With Vassakāra  *Vassakārasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, on the Vulture's Peak Mountain.

Now at that time King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the
princess of Videha, wanted to invade the Vajjis. He declared: "I shall
wipe out these Vajjis, so mighty and powerful! I shall destroy them, and
lay ruin and devastation upon them!"

And then King Ajātasattu addressed Vassakāra
the brahmin minister of Magadha, "Please, brahmin, go to the Buddha, and
in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and
well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably. And then say: 'Sir, King
Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, wants
to invade the Vajjis. He has declared: "I shall wipe out these Vajjis,
so mighty and powerful! I shall destroy them, and lay ruin and
devastation upon them!"' Remember well how the Buddha answers and tell
it to me. For Realized Ones say nothing that is not so."

"Yes, sir," Vassakāra replied. He went to the Buddha and
exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation
were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:

"Mister Gotama, King Ajātasattu bows with his head to your
feet. He asks if you are healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living
comfortably. King Ajātasattu wants to invade the Vajjis. He
has declared: 'I shall wipe out these Vajjis, so mighty and powerful! I
shall destroy them, and lay ruin and devastation upon them!'"

Now at that time Venerable Ānanda was standing behind the Buddha fanning
him. Then the Buddha said to him: "Ānanda, have you heard that the
Vajjis meet frequently and have many meetings?"

"I have heard that, sir."

"As long as the Vajjis meet frequently and have many meetings, they can
expect growth, not decline.

Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis meet in harmony, leave in
harmony, and carry on their business in harmony?"

"I have heard that, sir."

"As long as the Vajjis meet in harmony, leave in harmony, and carry on
their business in harmony, they can expect growth, not decline.

Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis don't make new decrees or abolish
existing decrees, but proceed having undertaken the ancient Vajjian
principles as they have been decreed?"

"I have heard that, sir."

"As long as the Vajjis don't make new decrees or abolish existing
decrees, but proceed having undertaken the ancient Vajjian traditions as
they have been decreed, they can expect growth, not decline.

Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and
venerate Vajjian elders, and think them worth listening to?"

"I have heard that, sir."

"As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate Vajjian
elders, and think them worth listening to, they can expect growth, not
decline.

Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis don't forcibly abduct the women
or girls of the clans and make them live with them?"

"I have heard that, sir."

"As long as the Vajjis don't forcibly abduct the women or girls of the
clans and make them live with them, they can expect growth, not decline.

Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and
venerate the Vajjian shrines, whether inner or outer, not neglecting the
proper spirit-offerings that were given and made in the past?"

"I have heard that, sir."

"As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Vajjian
shrines, whether inner or outer, not neglecting the proper
spirit-offerings that were given and made in the past, they can expect
growth, not decline.

Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis organize proper protection,
shelter, and security for perfected ones, so that more perfected ones
might come to the realm and those already here may live in comfort?"

"I have heard that, sir."

"As long as the Vajjis organize proper protection, shelter, and security
for perfected ones, so that more perfected ones might come to the realm
and those already here may live in comfort, they can expect growth, not
decline."

Then the Buddha said to Vassakāra:

"Brahmin, this one time I was staying near Vesālī at the
Sārandada woodland shrine. There I taught the Vajjis these
principles that prevent decline. As long as these seven principles that
prevent decline last among the Vajjis, and as long as the Vajjis are
seen following them, they can expect growth, not decline."

When the Buddha had spoken, Vassakāra said to him: "Mister
Gotama, if the Vajjis follow even a single one of these principles they
can expect growth, not decline. How much more so all seven! King
Ajātasattu cannot defeat the Vajjis in war, unless by
bribery or by sowing dissension. Well, now, Mister Gotama, I must go. I
have many duties, and much to do."

"Please, brahmin, go at your convenience." Then Vassakāra
the brahmin, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, got
up from his seat and left.

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.23 Non-Decline for Mendicants (1st)  *Paṭhamasattakasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, on the Vulture's Peak Mountain. There the Buddha
addressed the mendicants:

"Mendicants, I will teach you these seven principles that prevent
decline. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"What are the seven principles that prevent decline? As long as the
mendicants meet frequently and have many meetings, they can expect
growth, not decline.

As long as the mendicants meet in harmony, leave in harmony, and carry
on their business in harmony, they can expect growth, not decline.

As long as the mendicants don't make new decrees or abolish existing
decrees, but undertake and follow the training rules as they have been
decreed, they can expect growth, not decline.

As long as the mendicants honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the
senior mendicants---of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and
leaders of the Saṅgha---and think them worth listening to,
they can expect growth, not decline.

As long as the mendicants don't fall under the sway of arisen craving
for future lives, they can expect growth, not decline.

As long as the mendicants take care to live in wilderness lodgings, they
can expect growth, not decline.

As long as the mendicants individually establish mindfulness, so that
more good-hearted spiritual companions might come, and those that have
already come may live comfortably, they can expect growth, not decline.

As long as these seven principles that prevent decline last among the
mendicants, and as long as the mendicants are seen following them, they
can expect growth, not decline."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.24 Non-Decline for Mendicants (2nd)  *Dutiyasattakasutta*

"Mendicants, I will teach you seven principles that prevent decline.
Listen and apply your mind well ... And what are the seven principles
that prevent decline?

As long as the mendicants don't relish work, loving it and liking to
relish it, they can expect growth, not decline.

As long as they don't enjoy talk ... sleep ... company ... they don't
have corrupt wishes, falling under the sway of corrupt wishes ... they
don't have bad friends, companions, and associates ... they don't stop
half-way after achieving some insignificant distinction, they can expect
growth, not decline.

As long as these seven principles that prevent decline last among the
mendicants, and as long as the mendicants are seen following them, they

### AN 7.25 Non-Decline for Mendicants (3rd)  *Tatiyasattakasutta*

"Mendicants, I will teach you seven principles that prevent decline.
Listen and apply your mind well ... And what are the seven principles
that prevent decline? As long as the mendicants are faithful ...
conscientious ... prudent ... learned ... energetic ... mindful ...
wise, they can expect growth, not decline.

As long as these seven principles that prevent decline last among the
mendicants, and as long as the mendicants are seen following them, they
can expect growth, not decline."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.26 Awakening Factors  *Bojjhaṅgasutta*

"Mendicants, I will teach you seven principles that prevent decline.
Listen and apply your mind well ... And what are the seven principles
that prevent decline? As long as the mendicants develop the awakening
factor of mindfulness ... investigation of principles ... energy ...
rapture ... tranquility ... immersion ... equanimity, they can expect
growth, not decline.

As long as these seven principles that prevent decline last among the
mendicants, and as long as the mendicants are seen following them, they
can expect growth, not decline."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.27 Perceptions  *Saññāsutta*

"Mendicants, I will teach you seven principles that prevent decline.
Listen and apply your mind well ... And what are the seven principles
that prevent decline? As long as the mendicants develop the perception
of impermanence ...

not-self ... ugliness ... drawbacks ... giving up ... fading away ...
cessation, they can expect growth, not decline. As long as these seven
principles that prevent decline last among the mendicants, and as long
as the mendicants are seen following them, they can expect growth, not
decline."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.28 Non-decline for a Mendicant Trainee  *Paṭhamaparihānisutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:

"These seven things lead to the decline of a mendicant trainee. What
seven? They relish work, talk, sleep, and company. They don't guard the
sense doors and they eat too much. And when there is Saṅgha
business to be carried out, they don't reflect: 'There are senior
mendicants in the Saṅgha of long standing, long gone forth,
responsible. They'll be known for taking care of this.' So they try to
do it themselves. These seven things lead to the decline of a mendicant
trainee.

These seven things don't lead to the decline of a mendicant trainee.
What seven? They don't relish work, talk, sleep, and company. They guard

Saṅgha business to be carried out, they reflect: 'There are

don't try to do it themselves. These seven things don't lead to the
decline of a mendicant trainee."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.29 Non-decline for a Lay Follower  *Dutiyaparihānisutta*

"These seven things lead to the decline of a lay follower. What seven?
They miss out on seeing the mendicants. They neglect listening to the
true teaching. They don't train in higher ethical conduct. They're very
suspicious about mendicants, whether senior, junior, or middle. They
listen to the teaching with a hostile, fault-finding mind. They seek
outside of the Buddhist community for those worthy of religious
donations. And they serve them first. These seven things lead to the
decline of a lay follower.

These seven things don't lead to the decline of a lay follower. What
seven? They don't miss out on seeing the mendicants. They don't neglect
listening to the true teaching. They train in higher ethical conduct.
They're very confident about mendicants, whether senior, junior, or
middle. They don't listen to the teaching with a hostile, fault-finding
mind. They don't seek outside of the Buddhist community for those worthy
of religious donations. And they serve the Buddhist community first.
These seven things don't lead to the decline of a lay follower."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "A lay follower misses out on seeing\
> those who are evolved\
> and listening to the teachings of the Noble One.\
> They don't train in higher ethical conduct,
>
> and their suspicion about mendicants\

### AN 7.30 Failures for a Lay Follower  *Vipattisutta*

"Mendicants, there are these seven failures for a lay follower ...

There are these seven accomplishments for a lay follower ..."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.31 Downfalls for a Lay Follower  *Parābhavasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these seven downfalls for a lay follower ...
There are these seven successes for a lay follower. What seven?

They don't miss out on seeing the mendicants.

They don't neglect listening to the true teaching.

They train in higher ethical conduct.

They're very confident about mendicants, whether senior, junior, or
middle.

They don't listen to the teaching with a hostile, fault-finding mind.

They don't seek outside of the Buddhist community for those worthy of
religious donations.

And they serve the Buddhist community first.

These are the seven successes for a lay follower.

## The Chapter on Deities

### AN 7.32 Respect for Diligence  *Appamādagāravasutta*

Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta's
Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, these seven things don't lead to the decline of a mendicant
trainee. What seven? Respect for the Teacher, for the teaching, for the
Saṅgha, for the training, for immersion, for diligence, and
for hospitality. These seven things don't lead to the decline of a
mendicant trainee."

That's what that deity said, and the teacher approved. Then that deity,
knowing that the teacher approved, bowed and respectfully circled the
Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.

Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that
had happened, adding:

> "Respect for the Teacher and the teaching,\
> and keen respect for the Saṅgha;\
> respect for immersion, being energetic,\
> and keen respect for the training.
>
> A mendicant who respects diligence\
> and hospitality\
> can't decline,\
> and has drawn near to extinguishment."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.33 Respect for Conscience  *Hirigāravasutta*

"Mendicants, tonight, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta's
Grove, came to me, bowed, stood to one side, and said to me: 'Sir, these
seven things don't lead to the decline of a mendicant trainee. What
seven? Respect for the Teacher, for the teaching, for the
Saṅgha, for the training, for immersion, for conscience,
and for prudence. These seven things don't lead to the decline of a
mendicant trainee.'

That is what that deity said. Then he bowed and respectfully circled me,
keeping me on his right side, before vanishing right there.

> One respectful of the Teacher and the teaching,\
> keenly respecting the Saṅgha;\
> respecting immersion, being energetic,\
> and keenly respecting the training;
>
> endowed with conscience and prudence,\
> reverential and respectful---\
> it is impossible for them to decline;\

### AN 7.34 Easy to Admonish (1st)  *Paṭhamasovacassatāsutta*

"Mendicants, tonight a deity ... said to me: 'Sir, these seven things
don't lead to the decline of a mendicant trainee. What seven? Respect
for the Teacher, for the teaching, for the Saṅgha, for the
training, for immersion; being easy to admonish, and good friendship.
These seven things don't lead to the decline of a mendicant trainee.'

That is what that deity said. Then he bowed and respectfully circled me,
keeping me on his right side, before vanishing right there.

> Respect for the Teacher and the teaching,\

### AN 7.35 Easy to Admonish (2nd)  *Dutiyasovacassatāsutta*

"Mendicants, tonight a deity ... said to me: 'Sir, these seven things

These seven things don't lead to the decline of a mendicant trainee.'

That is what that deity said. Then he bowed and respectfully circled me,
keeping me on his right side, before vanishing right there."

When he said this, Venerable Sāriputta said to the Buddha:

"Sir, this is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha's
brief statement.

It's when a mendicant personally respects the Teacher and praises such
respect. And they encourage other mendicants who lack such respect to
respect the Teacher. And they praise other mendicants who respect the
Teacher at the right time, truthfully and correctly.

They personally respect the teaching ...

They personally respect the Saṅgha ...

They personally respect the training ...

They personally respect immersion ...

They are personally easy to admonish ...

They personally have good friends, and praise such friendship. And they
encourage other mendicants who lack good friends to develop good
friendship. And they praise other mendicants who have good friends at
the right time, truthfully and correctly.

That's how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha's brief
statement."

"Good, good, Sāriputta! It's good that you understand the
detailed meaning of what I've said in brief like this.

It's when a mendicant personally respects the Teacher ... And they
encourage other mendicants who lack such respect to respect the Teacher.
And they praise other mendicants who respect the Teacher at the right
time, truthfully and correctly.

They personally respect the teaching ...

They personally respect the Saṅgha ...

They personally respect the training ...

They personally respect immersion ...

They are personally easy to admonish ...

They personally have good friends, and praise such friendship. And they
encourage other mendicants who lack good friends to develop good
friendship. And they praise other mendicants who have good friends at
the right time, truthfully and correctly.

This is how to understand the detailed meaning of what I said in brief."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.36 A Friend (1st)  *Paṭhamamittasutta*

"Mendicants, you should associate with a friend who has seven factors.
What seven? They give what is hard to give. They do what is hard to do.
They endure what is hard to endure. They reveal their secrets to you.
They keep your secrets. They don't abandon you in times of trouble. They
don't look down on you in times of loss. You should associate with a
friend who has these seven factors.

> A friend gives what is hard to give,\
> and does what's hard to do.\
> They put up with your harsh words,\
> and with things hard to endure.

> They tell you their secrets,\

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.37 A Friend (2nd)  *Dutiyamittasutta*

"Mendicants, when a friend has seven qualities you should associate
with, accompany, and attend them, even if they send you away. What
seven? They're likable, agreeable, respected, and admired. They admonish
you and they accept admonishment. They speak on deep matters. And they
don't urge you to do bad things. When a friend has these seven qualities
you should associate with, accompany, and attend them, even if they send
you away.

> They're liked, respected, and admired,\

### AN 7.38 Textual Analysis (1st)  *Paṭhamapaṭisambhidāsutta*

"Mendicants, a mendicant with seven qualities will soon realize the four
kinds of textual analysis and live having achieved them with their own
insight. What seven?

It's when a mendicant truly understands: 'This is mental sluggishness'.

They truly understand internally constricted mind as 'internally
constricted mind'.

They truly understand externally scattered mind as 'externally scattered
mind'.

They know feelings as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away.

They know perceptions as they arise, as they remain, and as they go
away.

They know thoughts as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away.

The patterns of qualities---suitable or unsuitable, inferior or
superior, or those on the side of dark or bright---are properly grasped,
focused on, borne in mind, and comprehended with wisdom.

A mendicant with these seven qualities will soon realize the four kinds
of textual analysis and live having achieved them with their own
insight."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.39 Textual Analysis (2nd)  *Dutiyapaṭisambhidāsutta*

"Mendicants, having seven qualities, Sāriputta realized the

It's when Sāriputta truly understood: 'This is mental

He truly understood internally constricted mind as 'internally
constricted mind'.

He truly understood externally scattered mind as 'externally scattered

He knew feelings, perceptions, and thoughts as they arose, as they

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.40 Mastery of the Mind (1st)  *Paṭhamavasasutta*

"Mendicants, a mendicant with seven qualities masters their mind and is
not mastered by it. What seven? It's when a mendicant is skilled at
immersion, skilled in entering immersion, skilled in remaining in
immersion, skilled in emerging from immersion, skilled in gladdening the
mind for immersion, skilled in the meditation subjects for immersion,
and skilled in projecting the mind purified by immersion. A mendicant
with these seven qualities masters their mind and is not mastered by
it."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.41 Mastery of the Mind (2nd)  *Dutiyavasasutta*

"Mendicants, having seven qualities Sāriputta has mastered

is skilled at immersion, skilled in entering immersion, skilled in
remaining in immersion, skilled in emerging from immersion, skilled in
gladdening the mind for immersion, skilled in the meditation subjects
for immersion, and skilled in projecting the mind purified by immersion.
Having these seven qualities Sāriputta has mastered his

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.42 Graduation (1st)  *Paṭhamaniddasasutta*

Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and,
taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. Then
it occurred to him, "It's too early to wander for alms in
Sāvatthī. Why don't I visit the monastery of the wanderers
of other religions?"

Then he went to the monastery of the wanderers of other religions and
exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. When the greetings and
polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.

Now at that time while those wanderers of other religions were sitting
together this discussion came up among them, "Reverends, anyone who
lives the full and pure spiritual life for twelve years is qualified to
be called a 'graduate mendicant'."

Sāriputta neither approved nor dismissed that statement of
the wanderers of other religions. He got up from his seat, thinking, "I
will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself."

Then Sāriputta wandered for alms in Sāvatthī.
After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha,
bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened, adding:

"Sir, in this teaching and training can we describe a mendicant as a
'graduate' solely because they have completed a certain number of
years?"

"No, Sāriputta, we cannot. I make known these seven
qualifications for graduation after realizing them with my own insight.

What seven? It's when a mendicant has a keen enthusiasm to undertake the
training ... to examine the teachings ... to get rid of desires ... for
retreat ... to rouse up energy ... for mindfulness and alertness ... to
penetrate theoretically. And they don't lose these desires in the
future. These are the seven qualifications for graduation that I make
known after realizing them with my own insight. A mendicant who has
these seven qualifications for graduation is qualified to be called a
'graduate mendicant'. This is so whether they have lived the full and
pure spiritual life for twelve years, twenty-four years, thirty-six
years, or forty-eight years."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.43 Graduation (2nd)  *Dutiyaniddasasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Kosambī, in Ghosita's Monastery.

Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and
robe, entered Kosambī for alms. Then it occurred to him,
"It's too early to wander for alms in Kosambī. Why don't I
visit the monastery of the wanderers of other religions?"

Then he went to the monastery of the wanderers of other religions and
exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. When the greetings and
polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.

Now at that time while those wanderers of other religions were sitting
together this discussion came up among them, "Reverends, anyone who
lives the full and pure spiritual life for twelve years is qualified to
be called a 'graduate mendicant'."

Ānanda neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers of
other religions. He got up from his seat, thinking, "I will learn the
meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself."

Then Ānanda wandered for alms in Kosambī. After the meal,
on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to
one side, and told him what had happened, adding:

"Sir, in this teaching and training can we describe a mendicant as a
'graduate' solely because they have completed a certain number of
years?"

"No, Ānanda, we cannot. These are the seven qualifications for
graduation that I make known after realizing them with my own insight.

What seven? It's when someone is faithful, conscientious, prudent,
learned, energetic, mindful, and wise. These are the seven
qualifications for graduation that I make known after realizing them
with my own insight. A mendicant who has these seven qualifications for
graduation is qualified to be called a 'graduate mendicant'. This is so
whether they have lived the full and pure spiritual life for twelve
years, twenty-four years, thirty-six years, or forty-eight years."

## The Chapter on a Great Sacrifice

### AN 7.44 Planes of Consciousness  *Sattaviññāṇaṭṭhitisutta*

"Mendicants, there are these seven planes of consciousness. What seven?

There are sentient beings that are diverse in body and diverse in
perception, such as human beings, some gods, and some beings in the
underworld. This is the first plane of consciousness.

There are sentient beings that are diverse in body and unified in
perception, such as the gods reborn in the Divinity's host through the
first absorption. This is the second plane of consciousness.

There are sentient beings that are unified in body and diverse in
perception, such as the gods of streaming radiance. This is the third
plane of consciousness.

There are sentient beings that are unified in body and unified in
perception, such as the gods of universal beauty. This is the fourth
plane of consciousness.

There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond perceptions of
form. With the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on
perceptions of diversity, aware that 'space is infinite', they have been
reborn in the dimension of infinite space. This is the fifth plane of
consciousness.

There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond the dimension of
infinite space. Aware that 'consciousness is infinite', they have been
reborn in the dimension of infinite consciousness. This is the sixth
plane of consciousness.

There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond the dimension of
infinite consciousness. Aware that 'there is nothing at all', they have
been reborn in the dimension of nothingness. This is the seventh plane
of consciousness.

These are the seven planes of consciousness."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.45 Prerequisites for Immersion  *Samādhiparikkhārasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these seven prerequisites for immersion. What
seven? Right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right
livelihood, right effort, and right mindfulness. Unification of mind
with these seven factors as prerequisites is what is called noble right
immersion 'with its vital conditions' and also 'with its
prerequisites'."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.46 Fires (1st)  *Paṭhamaaggisutta*

"Mendicants, there are these seven fires. What seven? The fires of
greed, hate, delusion. The fire of those worthy of offerings dedicated
to the gods. A householder's fire. The fire of those worthy of a
religious donation. And a wood fire. These are the seven fires."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.47 Fires (2nd)  *Dutiyaaggisutta*

Now at that time the brahmin Uggatasarīra had prepared a
large sacrifice. Bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats and rams---five hundred
of each---had been led to the post for the sacrifice.

Then the brahmin Uggatasarīra went up to the Buddha, and
exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation
were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, "Mister
Gotama, I have heard that kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the
sacrificial post is very fruitful and beneficial."

"I've also heard this, brahmin."

For a second time ... and third time Uggatasarīra said to
the Buddha, "Mister Gotama, I have heard that kindling the sacrificial
fire and raising the sacrificial post is very fruitful and beneficial."

"I've also heard this, brahmin."

"Then Mister Gotama and I are in total agreement in this matter."

When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to Uggatasarīra,
"Brahmin, you shouldn't ask the Buddha in this way. You should ask in
this way: 'Sir, I want to kindle the sacrificial fire and raise the
sacrificial post. May the Buddha please advise and instruct me. It will
be for my lasting welfare and happiness.'"

Then Uggatasarīra said to the Buddha, "Mister Gotama, I
want to kindle the sacrificial fire and raise the sacrificial post. May
Mister Gotama please advise and instruct me. It will be for my lasting
welfare and happiness."

"Even before kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial
post, one raises three unskillful knives which ripen and result in
suffering. What three? The knives of the body, speech, and mind. Even
before kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post
one gives rise to the thought: 'May this many bulls, bullocks, heifers,
goats, and rams be slaughtered for the sacrifice!' Thinking, 'May I make
goodness', one makes wickedness. Thinking, 'May I do good', one does
bad. Thinking, 'May I seek the path to a good rebirth', one seeks the
path to a bad rebirth. Even before kindling the sacrificial fire and
raising the sacrificial post one raises this first unskillful mental
knife which ripens and results in suffering.

Furthermore, even before kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the
sacrificial post, one says such things as: 'May this many bulls,
bullocks, heifers, goats, and rams be slaughtered for the sacrifice!'
Thinking, 'May I make goodness', one makes wickedness. Thinking, 'May I
do good', one does bad. Thinking, 'May I seek the path to a good
rebirth', one seeks the path to a bad rebirth. Even before kindling the
sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post one raises this second
unskillful verbal knife which ripens and results in suffering.

Furthermore, even before kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the
sacrificial post one first personally undertakes preparations for the
sacrificial slaughter of bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats, and rams.
Thinking, 'May I make goodness', one makes wickedness. Thinking, 'May I
do good', one does bad. Thinking, 'May I seek the path to a good
rebirth', one seeks the path to a bad rebirth. Even before kindling the
sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post, one raises this third
unskillful bodily knife which ripens and results in suffering. Even
before kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post,
one raises these three unskillful knives which ripen and result in
suffering.

Brahmin, these three fires should be given up and rejected, not
cultivated. What three? The fires of greed, hate, and delusion.

And why should the fire of greed be given up and rejected, not
cultivated? A greedy person does bad things by way of body, speech, and
mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they're reborn in a place
of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. That's why the fire of greed
should be given up and rejected, not cultivated.

And why should the fire of hate be given up and rejected, not
cultivated? A hateful person does bad things by way of body, speech, and
mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they're reborn in a place
of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. That's why the fire of hate
should be given up and rejected, not cultivated.

And why should the fire of delusion be given up and rejected, not
cultivated? A deluded person does bad things by way of body, speech, and
mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they're reborn in a place
of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. That's why the fire of
delusion should be given up and rejected, not cultivated. These three
fires should be given up and rejected, not cultivated.

Brahmin, you should properly and happily take care of three fires,
honoring, respecting, esteeming, and venerating them. What three? The
fire of those worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods. The fire of a
householder. And the fire of those worthy of a religious donation.

And what is the fire of those worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods?
Your mother and father are called the fire of those worthy of offerings
dedicated to the gods. Why is that? Since it is from them that you've
been incubated and produced. So you should properly and happily take
care of this fire, honoring, respecting, esteeming, and venerating it.

And what is the fire of a householder? Your children, partners,
bondservants, servants, and workers are called a householder's fire. So
you should properly and happily take care of this fire, honoring,
respecting, esteeming, and venerating it.

And what is the fire of those worthy of a religious donation? The
ascetics and brahmins who refrain from intoxication and negligence, are
settled in patience and sweetness, and who tame, calm, and extinguish
themselves are called the fire of those worthy of a religious donation.
So you should properly and happily take care of this fire, honoring,
respecting, esteeming, and venerating it. You should properly and
happily take care of these three fires, honoring, respecting, esteeming,
and venerating them.

But the wood fire, brahmin, should, from time to time, be fanned,
watched over with equanimity, extinguished, or put aside."

When he said this, the brahmin Uggatasarīra said to the
Buddha, "Excellent, Mister Gotama! Excellent! ... From this day forth,
may Mister Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge
for life. Mister Gotama, I now set free these five hundred bulls, five
hundred bullocks, five hundred heifers, five hundred goats, and five
hundred rams. I give them life! May they eat grass and drink cool water
and enjoy a cool breeze!"

### AN 7.48 Perceptions in Brief  *Paṭhamasaññāsutta*

"Mendicants, these seven perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are
very fruitful and beneficial. They culminate in freedom from death and
end in freedom from death.

What seven? The perceptions of ugliness, death, repulsiveness of food,
dissatisfaction with the whole world, impermanence, suffering in
impermanence, and not-self in suffering. These seven perceptions, when
developed and cultivated, are very fruitful and beneficial. They
culminate in freedom from death and end in freedom from death."

### AN 7.49 Perceptions in Detail  *Dutiyasaññāsutta*

"Mendicants, these seven perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are
very fruitful and beneficial. They culminate in freedom from death and
end in freedom from death. What seven? The perceptions of ugliness,
death, repulsiveness of food, dissatisfaction with the whole world,
impermanence, suffering in impermanence, and not-self in suffering.
These seven perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are very
fruitful and beneficial. They culminate in freedom from death and end in
freedom from death.

'When the perception of ugliness is developed and cultivated it's very
fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in freedom from death and ends in
freedom from death.' That's what I said, but why did I say it? When a
mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the perception of
ugliness, their mind draws back from sexual intercourse. They shrink
away, turn aside, and don't get drawn into it. And either equanimity or
revulsion become stabilized. It's like a chicken's feather or a scrap of
sinew thrown in a fire. It shrivels up, shrinks, rolls up, and doesn't
stretch out. In the same way, when a mendicant often meditates with a
mind reinforced with the perception of ugliness, their mind draws back
from sexual intercourse. ...

If a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the
perception of ugliness, but their mind is drawn to sexual intercourse,
and not repulsed, they should know: 'My perception of ugliness is
undeveloped. I don't have any distinction higher than before. I haven't
attained a fruit of development.' In this way they are aware of the
situation. But if a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced
with the perception of ugliness, their mind draws back from sexual
intercourse ... they should know: 'My perception of ugliness is well
developed. I have realized a distinction higher than before. I have
attained a fruit of development.' In this way they are aware of the
situation. 'When the perception of ugliness is developed and cultivated
it's very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in freedom from death
and ends in freedom from death.' That's what I said, and this is why I
said it.

'When the perception of death is developed and cultivated it's very
fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in freedom from death and ends in
freedom from death.' That's what I said, but why did I say it? When a
mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the perception of
death, their mind draws back from desire to be reborn. ... That's what I
said, and this is why I said it.

'When the perception of the repulsiveness of food is developed and
cultivated it's very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in freedom
from death and ends in freedom from death.' That's what I said, but why
did I say it? When a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced
with the perception of the repulsiveness of food, their mind draws back
from craving for tastes. ... That's what I said, and this is why I said
it.

'When the perception of dissatisfaction with the whole world is
developed and cultivated it's very fruitful and beneficial. It
culminates in freedom from death and ends in freedom from death.' That's
what I said, but why did I say it? When a mendicant often meditates with
a mind reinforced with the perception of dissatisfaction with the whole
world, their mind draws back from the world's shiny things. ... That's
what I said, and this is why I said it.

'When the perception of impermanence is developed and cultivated it's
very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in freedom from death and
ends in freedom from death.' That's what I said, but why did I say it?
When a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the
perception of impermanence, their mind draws back from material things,
honors, and fame. ... That's what I said, and this is why I said it.

'When the perception of suffering in impermanence is developed and
cultivated it's very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in freedom
from death and ends in freedom from death.' That's what I said, but why
did I say it? When a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced
with the perception of suffering in impermanence, they establish a keen
perception of the danger of sloth, laziness, slackness, negligence, lack
of commitment, and failure to review, like a killer with a drawn sword.
... That's what I said, and this is why I said it.

'When the perception of not-self in suffering is developed and
cultivated it's very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in freedom
from death and ends in freedom from death.' That's what I said, but why
did I say it? When a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced
with the perception of not-self in suffering, their mind is rid of
I-making, mine-making, and conceit for this conscious body and all
external stimuli. It has gone beyond discrimination, and is peaceful and
well freed.

If a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the
perception of not-self in suffering, but their mind is not rid of
I-making, mine-making, and conceit for this conscious body and all
external stimuli; nor has it gone beyond discrimination, and is not
peaceful or well freed, they should know: 'My perception of not-self in
suffering is undeveloped. I don't have any distinction higher than
before. I haven't attained a fruit of development.' In this way they are
aware of the situation.

But if a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the
perception of not-self in suffering, and their mind is rid of I-making,
mine-making, and conceit for this conscious body and all external
stimuli; and it has gone beyond discrimination, and is peaceful and well
freed, they should know: 'My perception of not-self in suffering is well
developed. I have realized a distinction higher than before. I have
attained a fruit of development.' In this way they are aware of the
situation. 'When the perception of not-self in suffering is developed
and cultivated it's very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in
freedom from death and ends in freedom from death.' That's what I said,
and this is why I said it.

These seven perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are very
fruitful and beneficial. They culminate in freedom from death and end in
freedom from death."

### AN 7.50 Sex  *Methunasutta*

Then the brahmin Jānussoṇi went up to the Buddha, and
exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation
were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, "Does Mister
Gotama claim to be celibate?"

"Brahmin, if anyone should be rightly said to live the celibate life
intact, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, full and pure, it's me."

"But what, Mister Gotama, is a break, taint, stain, or mar in celibacy?"

"Firstly, an ascetic or brahmin who claims to be perfectly celibate does
not mutually engage in sex with a female. However, they consent to being
anointed, massaged, bathed, and rubbed by a female. They enjoy it and
like it and find it satisfying. This is a break, taint, stain, or mar in
celibacy. This is called one who lives the celibate life impurely, yoked
by the yoke of sex. They're not freed from rebirth, old age, death,
sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They're not freed from
suffering, I say.

Furthermore, an ascetic or brahmin who claims to be perfectly celibate
does not mutually engage in sex with a female. Nor do they consent to
massage and bathing. However, they giggle and play and have fun with
females. ...

they gaze into a female's eyes. ...

they listen through a wall or rampart to the sound of females laughing
or chatting or singing or crying. ...

they recall when they used to laugh, chat, and have fun with females ...

they see a householder or their child amusing themselves, supplied and
provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. ...

They don't see a householder or their child amusing themselves, supplied
and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. However, they
live the celibate life wishing to be reborn in one of the orders of
gods. They think: 'By this precept or observance or fervent austerity or
spiritual life, may I become one of the gods!' They enjoy it and like it
and find it satisfying. This is a break, taint, stain, or mar in
celibacy. This is called one who lives the celibate life impurely, yoked
by the yoke of sex. They're not free from rebirth, old age, death,
sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They're not free from
suffering, I say.

As long as I saw that these seven sexual yokes---or even one of
them---had not been given up in me, I didn't announce my supreme perfect
awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and
Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and
humans.

But when I saw that these seven sexual yokes---every one of them---had
been given up in me, I announced my supreme perfect awakening in this
world with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population
with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. Knowledge and
vision arose in me: 'My freedom is unshakable; this is my last rebirth;
now there'll be no more future lives.'"

When he said this, the brahmin Jānussoṇi said to the
Buddha, "Excellent, Mister Gotama! Excellent! ... From this day forth,
may Mister Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge
for life."

### AN 7.51 Yoking and Unyoking  *Saṁyogasutta*

"Mendicants, I will teach you an exposition of the teaching on yoking
and unyoking. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak. ... And
what is the exposition of the teaching on yoking and unyoking?

A woman focuses on her own femininity: her feminine moves, feminine
appearance, feminine ways, feminine desires, feminine voice, and
feminine adornment. She's stimulated by this and takes pleasure in it.
So she focuses on the masculinity of others: masculine moves, masculine
appearance, masculine ways, masculine desires, masculine voice, and
masculine adornment. She's stimulated by this and takes pleasure in it.
So she desires to yoke herself to another. And she desires the pleasure
and happiness that comes from such yoking. Sentient beings who relish
their femininity are yoked to men. This is how a woman does not
transcend her femininity.

A man focuses on his own masculinity: his masculine moves, masculine
appearance, masculine ways, masculine desires, masculine voice, and
masculine adornment. He's stimulated by this and takes pleasure in it.
So he focuses on the femininity of others: feminine moves, feminine
appearance, feminine ways, feminine desires, feminine voice, and

he desires to yoke himself to another. And he desires the pleasure and
happiness that comes from such yoking. Sentient beings who relish their
masculinity are yoked to women. This is how a man does not transcend his
masculinity. This is how yoking comes about.

And how does unyoking come about? A woman doesn't focus on her own
femininity: her feminine moves, feminine appearance, feminine ways,
feminine desires, feminine voice, and feminine adornment. She isn't
stimulated by this and takes no pleasure in it. So she doesn't focus on
the masculinity of others: masculine moves, masculine appearance,
masculine ways, masculine desires, masculine voice, and masculine
adornment. She isn't stimulated by this and takes no pleasure in it. So
she doesn't desire to yoke herself to another. Nor does she desire the
pleasure and happiness that comes from such yoking. Sentient beings who
do not relish their femininity are not yoked to men. This is how a woman
transcends her femininity.

A man doesn't focus on his own masculinity: masculine moves, masculine
appearance, masculine ways, masculine desires, masculine voice, and
masculine adornment. He isn't stimulated by this and takes no pleasure

Sentient beings who do not relish their masculinity are not yoked to

unyoking comes about. This is the exposition of the teaching on yoking
and unyoking."

### AN 7.52 A Very Fruitful Gift  *Dānamahapphalasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks
of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond.

Then several lay followers of Campā went to Venerable
Sāriputta, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
"Sir, it's been a long time since we've heard a Dhamma talk from the
Buddha. It would be good if we got to hear a Dhamma talk from the
Buddha."

"Well then, reverends, come on the next sabbath day. Hopefully you'll
get to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha."

"Yes, sir" they replied. Then they rose from their seats, bowed to
Sāriputta, and respectfully circled him before leaving.

Then on the next sabbath the lay followers of Campā went to
Venerable Sāriputta, bowed, and stood to one side. Then
they went together with Sāriputta to the Buddha, bowed, and
sat down to one side. Sāriputta said to the Buddha:

"Sir, could it be that someone gives a gift and it is not very fruitful
or beneficial, while someone else gives exactly the same gift and it is
very fruitful and beneficial?"

"Indeed it could, Sāriputta."

"Sir, what is the cause, what is the reason for this?"

"Sāriputta, take the case of a someone who gives a gift as
an investment, their mind tied to it, expecting to keep it, thinking
'I'll enjoy this in my next life'. They give to ascetics or brahmins
such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and
makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. What do you think,
Sāriputta, don't some people give gifts in this way?"

"Yes, sir."

"Sāriputta, someone who gives a gift as an investment, when
their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in the company of the gods
of the four great kings. When that deed, success, glory, and sovereignty
is spent they return to this place.

Next, take the case of a someone who gives a gift not as an investment,
their mind not tied to it, not expecting to keep it, and not thinking,
'I'll enjoy this in my next life'. But they give a gift thinking, 'It's
good to give' ...

They give a gift thinking, 'Giving was practiced by my father and my
father's father. It would not be right for me to abandon this family
tradition.' ...

They give a gift thinking, 'I cook, they don't. It wouldn't be right for
me to not give to them.' ...

They give a gift thinking, 'The ancient brahmin seers were
Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva,
Vessāmitta, Yamadaggi, Aṅgīrasa,
Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu. Just
as they performed great sacrifices, I will share a gift.' ...

They give a gift thinking, 'When giving this gift my mind becomes clear,
and I become happy and joyful.' ...

They don't give a gift thinking, 'When giving this gift my mind becomes
clear, and I become happy and joyful.' But they give a gift thinking,
'This is an adornment and requisite for the mind.' They give to ascetics
or brahmins such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands,
fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. What do you think,
Sāriputta, don't some people give gifts in this way?"

"Yes, sir."

"Sāriputta, someone who gives gifts, not for any other
reason, but thinking, 'This is an adornment and requisite for the mind',
when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn among the gods of the
Divinity's host. When that deed, success, glory, and sovereignty is
spent they are a non-returner; they do not return to this place.

This is the cause, this is the reason why someone gives a gift and it is
not very fruitful or beneficial, while someone else gives exactly the
same gift and it is very fruitful and beneficial."

### AN 7.53 Nanda's Mother  *Nandamātāsutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the venerables
Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna were wandering in
the Southern Hills together with a large Saṅgha of
mendicants. Now at that time the laywoman Veḷukaṇṭakī,
Nanda's mother, rose at the crack of dawn and recited the verses of "The
Way to the Far Shore".

And at that time the great king Vessavaṇa was on his way
from the north to the south on some business. He heard Nanda's Mother
reciting, and stood waiting for her to finish.

Then when her recital was over she fell silent. Then, knowing she had
finished, Vessavaṇa applauded, saying, "Good, sister! Good,
sister!"

"But who might you be, dearest?"

"Sister, I am your brother Vessavaṇa, the great king."

"Good, dearest! Then may my recital of the teaching be my offering to
you as my guest."

'Good, sister! And let this also be your offering to me as your guest.
Tomorrow, the mendicant Saṅgha headed by
Sāriputta and Moggallāna will arrive at
Veḷukaṇṭa before breakfast. When you've served the
Saṅgha, please dedicate the religious donation to me. Then
that will also be your offering to me as your guest."

And when the night had passed the lay woman Nanda's Mother had delicious
fresh and cooked foods prepared in her own home. Then the
Saṅgha of mendicants headed by Sāriputta and
Moggallāna arrived at Veḷukaṇṭa. Then Nanda's
Mother addressed a man, "Please, mister, go to the monastery and
announce the time to the Saṅgha, saying: 'Sirs, it's time.
The meal is ready in the home of the lady Nanda's Mother.'"

"Yes, Ma'am," that man replied, and he did as she said.

And then the Saṅgha of mendicants headed by
Sāriputta and Moggallāna robed up in the
morning and, taking their bowls and robes, went to the home of Nanda's
Mother, where they sat on the seats spread out. Then Nanda's Mother
served and satisfied them with her own hands with delicious fresh and
cooked foods.

When Sāriputta had eaten and washed his hand and bowl,
Nanda's Mother sat down to one side. Sāriputta said to her,
"Nanda's Mother, who told you that the Saṅgha of mendicants
was about to arrive?"

"Sir, last night I rose at the crack of dawn and recited the verses of
'The Way to the Far Shore', and then I fell silent. Then the great king
Vessavaṇa, knowing I had finished, applauded me, 'Good,
sister! Good, sister!'

I asked: 'But who might you be, dearest?'

'Sister, I am your brother Vessavaṇa, the great king.'

'Good, dearest! Then may my recital of the teaching be my offering to
you as my guest.'

'Good, sister! And let this also be your offering to me as your guest.
Tomorrow, the mendicant Saṅgha headed by
Sāriputta and Moggallāna will arrive at
Veḷukaṇṭa before breakfast. When you've served the
Saṅgha, please dedicate the religious donation to me. Then
that will also be your offering to me as your guest.'

And so, sir, may the merit and the flourishing of merit of this gift be
for the happiness of the great king Vessavaṇa."

"It's incredible, Nanda's Mother, it's amazing that you converse face to
face with a mighty and illustrious god like the great king
Vessavaṇa."

"Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality; there is
another. I had an only son called Nanda who I loved dearly. The rulers
forcibly abducted him on some pretext and had him executed. But I can't
recall getting upset when my boy was under arrest or being arrested,
imprisoned or being put in prison, killed or being killed."

"It's incredible, Nanda's Mother, it's amazing that you purify even the
arising of a thought."

"Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality; there is
another. When my husband passed away he was reborn in one of the realms
of spirits. He revealed to me his previous incarnation. But I can't
recall getting upset on that account."

"It's incredible, Nanda's Mother, it's amazing that you purify even the
arising of a thought."

"Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality; there is
another. Ever since we were both young, and I was given in marriage to
my husband, I can't recall betraying him even in thought, still less in
deed."

"It's incredible, Nanda's Mother, it's amazing that you purify even the
arising of a thought."

"Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality; there is
another. Ever since I declared myself a lay follower, I can't recall
deliberately breaking any precept."

"It's incredible, Nanda's Mother, it's amazing!"

"Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality; there is
another. Whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first
absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while
placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind
and keeping it connected are stilled, I enter and remain in the second
absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with
internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping
it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, I enter and remain in
the third absorption, where I meditate with equanimity, mindful and
aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones
declare, 'Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.' With the
giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and
sadness, I enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure
or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness."

"It's incredible, Nanda's Mother, it's amazing!"

"Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality; there is
another. Of the five lower fetters taught by the Buddha, I don't see any
that I haven't given up."

"It's incredible, Nanda's Mother, it's amazing!"

Then Venerable Sāriputta educated, encouraged, fired up,
and inspired Nanda's Mother with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up
from his seat and left.


## The Chapter on the Undeclared Points

### AN 7.54 The Undeclared Points  *Abyākatasutta*

Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and
said to him:

"Sir, what is the cause, what is the reason why a learned noble disciple
has no doubts regarding the undeclared points?"

"Mendicant, it's due to the cessation of views that a learned noble
disciple has no doubts regarding the undeclared points. 'A realized one
still exists after death': this is a misconception. 'A realized one no
longer exists after death': this is a misconception. 'A realized one
both still exists and no longer exists after death': this is a
misconception. 'A realized one neither still exists nor no longer exists
after death': this is a misconception. An unlearned ordinary person
doesn't understand views, their origin, their cessation, or the practice
that leads to their cessation. And so their views grow. They're not
freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain,
sadness, and distress. They're not freed from suffering, I say.

A learned noble disciple does understand views, their origin, their
cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation. And so their
views cease. They're freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from
sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They're freed from
suffering, I say. Knowing and seeing this, a learned noble disciple does
not answer: 'A realized one still exists after death', 'A realized one
no longer exists after death', 'a realized one both still exists and no
longer exists after death', 'a realized one neither still exists nor no
longer exists after death.' Knowing and seeing this, a learned noble
disciple does not declare the undeclared points. Knowing and seeing
this, a learned noble disciple doesn't shake, tremble, quake, or get
nervous regarding the undeclared points.

'A realized one still exists after death': this is just about craving.
... it's just about perception ... it's a conceiving ... it's a
proliferation ... it's just about grasping ... 'A realized one still
exists after death': this is a regret. 'A realized one no longer exists
after death': this is a regret. 'A realized one both still exists and no
longer exists after death': this is a regret. 'A realized one neither
still exists nor no longer exists after death': this is a regret. An
unlearned ordinary person doesn't understand regrets, their origin,
their cessation, or the practice that leads to their cessation. And so
their regrets grow. They're not freed from rebirth, old age, and death,
from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They're not freed
from suffering, I say.

A learned noble disciple does understand regrets, their origin, their
cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation. And so their
regrets cease. They're freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from
sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They're freed from

### AN 7.55 Places People Are Reborn  *Purisagatisutta*

"Mendicants, I will teach you seven places people are reborn, and
extinguishment by not grasping. Listen and apply your mind well, I will
speak."

"Yes, sir," the mendicants replied. The Buddha said this:

"And what are the seven places people are reborn?

Take a mendicant who practices like this: 'It might not be, and it might
not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine. I am giving up
what exists, what has come to be.' They gain equanimity. They're not
attached to life, or to creating a new life. And they see with right
wisdom that there is a peaceful state beyond. But they haven't
completely realized that state. They haven't totally given up the
underlying tendencies of conceit, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.
With the ending of the five lower fetters they're extinguished between
one life and the next. Suppose you struck an iron pot that had been
heated all day. Any spark that flew off would be extinguished. In the
same way, a mendicant who practices like this ... With the ending of the
five lower fetters they're extinguished between one life and the next.

not be mine. ...' With the ending of the five lower fetters they're
extinguished without extra effort. Suppose you struck an iron pot that
had been heated all day. Any spark that flew off and floated away would
fall on a little heap of grass or twigs. There it would ignite a fire
and produce smoke. But the fire would consume the grass or twigs and
become extinguished due to not being fed. In the same way, a mendicant
who practices like this ... 'It might not be, and it might not be mine.

on a huge heap of grass or twigs. There it would ignite a fire and
produce smoke. And after consuming the grass and twigs, the fire would
burn up plants and trees until it reached a green field, a roadside, a
cliff's edge, a body of water, or cleared parkland, where it would be
extinguished due to not being fed. In the same way, a mendicant who
practices like this ... 'It might not be, and it might not be mine. ...'
With the ending of the five lower fetters they head upstream, going to
the Akaniṭṭha realm. These are the seven places people are
reborn.

And what is extinguishment by not grasping? Take a mendicant who
practices like this: 'It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will
not be, and it will not be mine. I am giving up what exists, what has
come to be.' They gain equanimity. They're not attached to life, or to
creating a new life. And they see with right wisdom that there is a
peaceful state beyond. And they have totally realized that state.
They've completely given up the underlying tendencies of conceit, desire
to be reborn, and ignorance. They've realized the undefiled freedom of
heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized
it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. This is
called extinguishment by not grasping.

These are the seven places people are reborn, and extinguishment by not
grasping."

### AN 7.56 Tissa the Divinity  *Tissabrahmāsutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, on the Vulture's Peak Mountain.

Then, late at night, two glorious deities, lighting up the entire
Vulture's Peak, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. One
deity said to him, "Sir, these nuns are freed!"

The other deity said to him, "Sir, these nuns are well freed with no
residue!"

This is what those deities said, and the teacher approved. Then those
deities, knowing that the teacher approved, bowed and respectfully
circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right
there.

Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that
had happened.

Now at that time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was sitting not
far from the Buddha. He thought, "Which gods know whether a person has
anything left over or not?"

Now, at that time a monk called Tissa had recently passed away and been
reborn in a realm of divinity. There they knew that Tissa the Divinity
was very mighty and powerful.

And then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, as easily as a strong
person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Vulture's
Peak and reappeared in that realm of divinity.

Tissa saw Moggallāna coming off in the distance, and said
to him, "Come, my good Moggallāna! Welcome, my good
Moggallāna! It's been a long time since you took the
opportunity to come here. Sit, my good Moggallāna, this
seat is for you."

Moggallāna sat down on the seat spread out. Then Tissa
bowed to Moggallāna and sat to one side.

Moggallāna said to him, "Which gods know whether a person
has anything left over or not?"

"The gods of the Divinity's host know this."

"But do all of them know this?"

"No, my good Moggallāna, not all of them.

Those gods of the Divinity's host who are content with the lifespan of
the Divinity, with the beauty, happiness, glory, and sovereignty of the
Divinity, and who don't truly understand any escape beyond: they don't
know this. But those gods of the Divinity's host who are not content
with the lifespan of the Divinity, with the beauty, happiness, glory,
and sovereignty of the Divinity, and who do truly understand any escape
beyond: they do know this.

Take a mendicant who is freed both ways. The gods know of them: 'This
venerable is freed both ways. As long as their body remains they will be
seen by gods and humans. But when their body breaks up gods and humans
will see them no more.' This too is how those gods know whether a person
has anything left over or not.

Take a mendicant who is freed by wisdom. The gods know of them: 'This
venerable is freed by wisdom. As long as their body remains they will be
seen by gods and humans. But when their body breaks up gods and humans
will see them no more.' This too is how those gods know whether a person
has anything left over or not.

Take a mendicant who is a direct witness. The gods know of them: 'This
venerable is a direct witness. Hopefully this venerable will frequent
appropriate lodgings, associate with good friends, and control their
faculties. Then they might realize the supreme culmination of the
spiritual path in this very life, and live having achieved with their
own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay
life to homelessness.' This too is how those gods know whether a person
has anything left over or not.

Take a mendicant who is attained to view. ... freed by faith ... a
follower of teachings. The gods know of them: 'This venerable is a
follower of teachings. Hopefully this venerable will frequent
appropriate lodgings, associate with good friends, and control their
faculties. Then they might realize the supreme culmination of the
spiritual path in this very life, and live having achieved with their
own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay
life to homelessness.' This too is how those gods know whether a person
has anything left over or not."

Moggallāna approved and agreed with what Tissa the Divinity
said. Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their
arm, he vanished from the realm of divinity and reappeared on the
Vulture's Peak. Then Mahāmoggallāna went up to the Buddha,
bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.

"But Moggallāna, Tissa the Divinity didn't teach the
seventh person, the signless meditator."

"Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! May the Buddha
teach the seventh person, the signless meditator. The mendicants will
listen and remember it."

"Well then, Moggallāna, listen and apply your mind well, I
will speak."

"Yes, sir," Mahāmoggallāna replied. The Buddha said this:

"Moggallāna, take the case of a mendicant who, not focusing
on any signs, enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart.
The gods know of them: 'This venerable, not focusing on any signs,
enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart. Hopefully
this venerable will frequent appropriate lodgings, associate with good
friends, and control their faculties. Then they might realize the
supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life, and live
having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen
rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.' This too is how
those gods know whether a person has anything left over or not."

### AN 7.57 General Sīha  *Sīhasenāpatisutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked
roof. Then General Sīha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat
down to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, can you point out a fruit of giving that's apparent in the present
life?"

"Well then, Sīha, I'll ask you about this in return, and
you can answer as you like. What do you think, Sīha?
Consider two people. One is faithless, stingy, miserly, and abusive. One
is a faithful donor who loves charity. Which do you think the perfected
ones will show sympathy for first?"

"Why would the perfected ones first show sympathy for the person who is
faithless, stingy, miserly, and abusive? They'd show sympathy first for
the faithful donor who loves charity."

"Which do you think the perfected ones will first approach?" "They'd
first approach the faithful donor who loves charity."

"Which do you think the perfected ones will receive alms from first?"
"They'd receive alms first from the faithful donor who loves charity."

"Which do you think the perfected ones will teach the Dhamma to first?"
"They'd first teach the Dhamma to the faithful donor who loves charity."

"Which do you think would get a good reputation?" "The faithful donor
who loves charity would get a good reputation."

"Which do you think would enter any kind of assembly bold and assured,
whether it's an assembly of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or
ascetics?"

"How could the person who is faithless, stingy, miserly, and abusive
enter any kind of assembly bold and assured, whether it's an assembly of
aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics? The faithful donor who
loves charity would enter any kind of assembly bold and assured, whether
it's an assembly of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics."

"When their body breaks up, after death, which do you think would be
reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm?"

"Why would the person who is faithless, stingy, miserly, and abusive be
reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm? The faithful donor who loves
charity would, when their body breaks up, after death, be reborn in a
good place, a heavenly realm.

When it comes to these fruits of giving that are apparent in the present
life, I don't have to rely on faith in the Buddha, for I know them too.
I'm a giver, a donor, and the perfected ones show sympathy for me first.
I'm a giver, and the perfected ones approach me first. I'm a giver, and
the perfected ones receive alms from me first. I'm a giver, and the
perfected ones teach me Dhamma first. I'm a giver, and I have this good
reputation: 'General Sīha gives, serves, and attends on the
Saṅgha.' I'm a giver, I enter any kind of assembly bold and
assured, whether it's an assembly of aristocrats, brahmins,
householders, or ascetics. When it comes to these fruits of giving that
are apparent in the present life, I don't have to rely on faith in the
Buddha, for I know them too. But when the Buddha says: 'When a giver's
body breaks up, after death, they're reborn in a good place, a heavenly
realm.' I don't know this, so I have to rely on faith in the Buddha."

"That's so true, Sīha! That's so true! When a giver's body
breaks up, after death, they're reborn in a good place, a heavenly
realm."

### AN 7.58 Nothing to Hide  *Arakkheyyasutta*

"Mendicants, there are four areas where the Realized One has nothing to
hide, and three ways he is irreproachable. What are the four areas where
the Realized One has nothing to hide?

His bodily behavior is pure. So the Realized One has no bodily
misconduct to hide, thinking: 'Don't let others find this out about me!'

His verbal behavior is pure. So the Realized One has no verbal
misconduct to hide, thinking: 'Don't let others find this out about me!'

His mental behavior is pure. So the Realized One has no mental
misconduct to hide, thinking: 'Don't let others find this out about me!'

His livelihood is pure. So the Realized One has no wrong livelihood to
hide, thinking: 'Don't let others find this out about me!'

These are the four areas where the Realized One has nothing to hide.

What are the three ways the Realized One is irreproachable?

The Realized One has explained the teaching well. I see no reason for
anyone---whether ascetic, brahmin, god, Māra, or the
Divinity, or anyone else in the world---to legitimately scold me,
saying: 'For such and such reasons you haven't explained the teaching
well.' Since I see no such reason, I live secure, fearless, and assured.

I have clearly described the practice that leads to extinguishment for
my disciples. Practicing in accordance with this, my disciples realize
the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life.
And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the
ending of defilements. I see no reason for anyone---whether ascetic,
brahmin, god, Māra, or the Divinity, or anyone else in the
world---to legitimately scold me, saying: 'For such and such reasons you
haven't clearly described the practice that leads to extinguishment for
your disciples.' Since I see no such reason, I live secure, fearless,
and assured.

Many hundreds in my assembly of disciples have realized the undefiled
freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live
having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of
defilements. I see no reason for anyone---whether ascetic, brahmin, god,
Māra, or the Divinity, or anyone else in the world---to
legitimately scold me, saying: 'For such and such reasons you don't have
many hundreds of disciples in your following who have realized the
undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and
who live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of
defilements.' Since I see no such reason, I live secure, fearless, and
assured.

These are the three ways the Realized One is irreproachable.

These are the four areas where the Realized One has nothing to hide, and
the three ways he is irreproachable."

### AN 7.59 With Kimbila  *Kimilasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Kimbilā in the Freshwater Mangrove Wood. Then Venerable
Kimbila went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to
him:

"What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why the true teaching does
not last long after the final quenching of the Realized One?"

"Kimbila, it's when the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen lack respect
and reverence for the Teacher, the teaching, the Saṅgha,
the training, immersion, diligence, and hospitality after the final
quenching of the Realized One. This is the cause, this is the reason why
the true teaching does not last long after the final quenching of the
Realized One."

"What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why the true teaching does
last long after the final quenching of the Realized One?"

"Kimbila, it's when the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen maintain
respect and reverence for the Teacher, the teaching, the
Saṅgha, the training, immersion, diligence, and hospitality
after the final quenching of the Realized One. This is the cause, this
is the reason why the true teaching does last long after the final
quenching of the Realized One."

### AN 7.60 Seven Qualities  *Sattadhammasutta*

"Mendicants, a mendicant with seven qualities soon realizes the supreme
culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. They live having
achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go
forth from the lay life to homelessness. What seven? It's when a
mendicant is faithful, ethical, learned, secluded, energetic, mindful,
and wise. A mendicant with these seven qualities soon realizes the
supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. They live
having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen
rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.61 Nodding Off  *Pacalāyamānasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying in the
land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at
Bhesakaḷā's Wood.

Now at that time, in the land of the Magadhans near
Kallavāḷamutta Village, Venerable
Mahāmoggallāna was nodding off while meditating. The Buddha
saw him with his clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman. Then, as
easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he
vanished from the deer park at Bhesakaḷā's Wood in the land
of the Bhaggas and reappeared in front of Mahāmoggallāna
near Kallavāḷamutta Village in the land of the Magadhans.

He sat on the seat spread out and said to Mahāmoggallāna,
"Are you nodding off, Moggallāna? Are you nodding off?"

"Yes, sir."

"So, Moggallāna, don't focus on or cultivate the perception
that you were meditating on when you fell drowsy. It's possible that
you'll give up drowsiness in this way.

But what if that doesn't work? Then think about and consider the
teaching as you've learned and memorized it, examining it with your
mind. It's possible that you'll give up drowsiness in this way.

But what if that doesn't work? Then recite in detail the teaching as
you've learned and memorized it. It's possible that you'll give up
drowsiness in this way.

But what if that doesn't work? Then pinch your ears and rub your limbs.
It's possible that you'll give up drowsiness in this way.

But what if that doesn't work? Then get up from your seat, flush your
eyes with water, look around in every direction, and look up at the
stars and constellations. It's possible that you'll give up drowsiness
in this way.

But what if that doesn't work? Then apply your mind to the perception of
light, focusing on the perception of day: as by day, so by night; as by
night, so by day. And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, develop a
mind that's full of radiance. It's possible that you'll give up
drowsiness in this way.

But what if that doesn't work? Then walk mindfully, focusing on the
perception of before and behind, your faculties directed inwards and
your mind not scattered outside. It's possible that you'll give up
drowsiness in this way.

But what if that doesn't work? Then lie down in the lion's posture---on
the right side, placing one foot on top of the other---mindful and
aware, and focused on the time of getting up. When you wake, you should
get up quickly, thinking: 'I will not live indulging in the pleasures of
sleeping, lying down, and drowsing.' That's how you should train.

So you should train like this: 'I will not approach families with my
head swollen with vanity.' That's how you should train. What happens if
a mendicant approaches families with a head swollen with vanity? Well,
families have business to attend to, so people might not notice when a
mendicant arrives. In that case the mendicant thinks: 'Who on earth has
turned this family against me? It seems they don't like me any more.'
And so, because they don't get anything they feel dismayed. Being
dismayed, they become restless. Being restless, they lose restraint. And
without restraint the mind is far from immersion.

So you should train like this: 'I won't get into arguments.' That's how
you should train. When there's an argument, you can expect there'll be
lots of talking. When there's lots of talking, people become restless.
Being restless, they lose restraint. And without restraint the mind is
far from immersion. Moggallāna, I don't praise all kinds of
closeness. Nor do I criticize all kinds of closeness. I don't praise
closeness with laypeople and renunciates. I do praise closeness with
those lodgings that are quiet and still, far from the madding crowd,
remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat."

When he said this, Venerable Moggallāna asked the Buddha,
"Sir, how do you briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the
ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate
sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal,
and is best among gods and humans?"

"Take a mendicant who has heard: 'Nothing is worth insisting on.' When a
mendicant has heard that nothing is worth insisting on, they directly
know all things. Directly knowing all things, they completely understand
all things. Completely understanding all things, when they experience
any kind of feeling---pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral---they meditate
observing impermanence, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in those
feelings. Meditating in this way, they don't grasp at anything in the
world. Not grasping, they're not anxious. Not being anxious, they
personally become extinguished.

They understand: 'Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been
completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further
for this place.' That's how I briefly define a mendicant who is freed
through the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the
ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the
ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans."

### AN 7.62 Don't Fear Good Deeds  *Mettasutta*

"Mendicants, don't fear good deeds. For 'good deeds' is a term for
happiness. I recall undergoing for a long time the likable, desirable,
and agreeable results of good deeds performed over a long time. I
developed a mind of love for seven years. As a result, for seven eons of
the cosmos contracting and expanding I didn't return to this world
again. As the cosmos contracted I went to the realm of streaming
radiance. As it expanded I was reborn in an empty mansion of divinity.

There I was the Divinity, the Great Divinity, the vanquisher, the
unvanquished, the universal seer, the wielder of power. I was Sakka,
lord of gods, thirty-six times. Many hundreds of times I was a king, a
wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. My dominion extended
to all four sides, I achieved stability in the country, and I possessed
the seven treasures. These were my seven treasures: the wheel, the
elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder, and the
commander as the seventh treasure. I had over a thousand sons who were
valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of my enemies. After conquering
this land girt by sea, I reigned by principle, without rod or sword.

> See the result of good deeds,\
> of skillful deeds, for one seeking happiness.\

### AN 7.63 Kinds of Wives  *Bhariyāsutta*

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
went to the home of the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, where he
sat on the seat spread out.

Now at that time people in Anāthapiṇḍika's home were making
a dreadful racket. Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went
up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to
him, "Householder, what's with the people making that dreadful racket in
your home? You'd think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!"

"Sir, that's my daughter-in-law Sujātā. She's been brought
here from a wealthy family. She doesn't obey her mother-in-law or
father-in-law or her husband. And she does not honor, respect, esteem,
and venerate the Buddha."

Then the Buddha addressed Sujātā, saying, "Come,
Sujātā."

"Yes, sir," she replied. She went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down
to one side. The Buddha said to her:

"Sujātā, a man can have seven kinds of wife. What seven? A
wife like a killer, a wife like a thief, a wife like a lord, a wife like
a mother, a wife like a sister, a wife like a friend, and a wife like a
bondservant. These are the kinds of wife that a man can have. Which one
of these are you?"

"Sir, I don't understand the detailed meaning of what the Buddha has
said in brief. Please teach me this matter so I can understand the
detailed meaning."

"Well then, Sujātā, listen and apply your mind well, I will
speak."

"Yes, sir," she replied. The Buddha said this:

> "With a mind full of hate and no kindness,\
> lusting for others, looking down on her husband,\
> she longs to murder him who paid the price for her.\
> A man's wife of this sort\
> is called a wife and a killer.
>
> A woman's husband earns his wealth\
> by focusing on a profession, trade, or farming.\
> And even if it's only a little, she wants to take it.\
> A man's wife of this sort\
> is called a wife and a thief.
>
> She's an idle glutton who doesn't want to work.\
> Her words are harsh, fierce, and rude.\
> She rules over him, though he rises early.\
> A man's wife of this sort\
> is called a wife and a lord.
>
> She's always caring and kind,\
> looking after her husband like a mother her child.\
> She keeps the wealth that he has earned secure.\
> A man's wife of this sort\
> is called a wife and a mother.
>
> She respects her husband\
> as a younger sister respects her elder.\
> Conscientious, she does what her husband says.\
> A man's wife of this sort\
> is called a wife and a sister.
>
> She's delighted to see him,\
> like one reunited with a long-lost friend.\
> She's of good pedigree, virtuous, and devoted.\
> A man's wife of this sort\
> is called a wife and a friend.
>
> She has no anger\
> \>when threatened with violence by the rod.\
> Without hate or anger,\
> she endures her husband and does what he says.\
> A man's wife of this sort\
> is called a wife and a bondservant.
>
> The kinds of wives here called\
> killer, thief, and lord;\
> immoral, harsh, and lacking regard for others,\
> when their body breaks up they set course for hell.
>
> But the kinds of wives here called\
> mother, sister, friend, and bondservant;\
> steadfast in their own morality,\
> \>restrained for a long time,\
> when their body breaks up\
> \>they set course for a good place.

Sujātā, these are the seven kinds of wife that a man can
have. Which one of these are you?"

"Sir, from this day forth may the Buddha remember me as a wife like a
bondservant."

### AN 7.64 Irritable  *Kodhanasutta*

"Mendicants, these seven things that please and assist an enemy happen
to an irritable woman or man. What seven?

Firstly, an enemy wishes for an enemy: 'If only they'd become ugly!' Why
is that? Because an enemy doesn't like to have a beautiful enemy. An
irritable individual, overcome and overwhelmed by anger, is ugly, even
though they're nicely bathed and anointed, with hair and beard dressed,
and wearing white clothes. This is the first thing that pleases and
assists an enemy which happens to an irritable woman or man.

Furthermore, an enemy wishes for an enemy: 'If only they'd sleep badly!'
Why is that? Because an enemy doesn't like to have an enemy who sleeps
at ease. An irritable individual, overcome and overwhelmed by anger,
sleeps badly, even though they sleep on a couch spread with woolen
covers---shag-piled, pure white, or embroidered with flowers---and
spread with a fine deer hide, with a canopy above and red pillows at
both ends. This is the second thing ...

Furthermore, an enemy wishes for an enemy: 'If only they don't get all
they need!' Why is that? Because an enemy doesn't like to have an enemy
who gets all they need. When an irritable individual, overcome and
overwhelmed by anger, gets what they don't need they think, 'I've got
what I need.' When they get what they need they think, 'I've got what I
don't need.' When an angry person gets these things that are the exact
opposite of what they need, it's for their lasting harm and suffering.
This is the third thing ...

Furthermore, an enemy wishes for an enemy: 'If only they weren't
wealthy!' Why is that? Because an enemy doesn't like to have an enemy
who is wealthy. When an individual is irritable, overcome and
overwhelmed by anger, the rulers seize the legitimate wealth they've
earned by their efforts, built up with their own hands, gathered by the
sweat of their brow. This is the fourth thing ...

Furthermore, an enemy wishes for an enemy: 'If only they weren't
famous!' Why is that? Because an enemy doesn't like to have a famous
enemy. When an individual is irritable, overcome and overwhelmed by
anger, any fame they have acquired by diligence falls to dust. This is
the fifth thing ...

Furthermore, an enemy wishes for an enemy: 'If only they had no
friends!' Why is that? Because an enemy doesn't like to have an enemy
with friends. When an individual is irritable, overcome and overwhelmed
by anger, their friends and colleagues, relatives and kin avoid them
from afar. This is the sixth thing ...

Furthermore, an enemy wishes for an enemy: 'If only, when their body
breaks up, after death, they're reborn in a place of loss, a bad place,
the underworld, hell!' Why is that? Because an enemy doesn't like to
have an enemy who goes to a good place. When an individual is irritable,
overcome and overwhelmed by anger, they do bad things by way of body,
speech, and mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they're reborn
in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. This is the
seventh thing that pleases and assists an enemy which happens to an
irritable woman or man.

These are the seven things that please and assist an enemy which happen
to an irritable woman or man.

> An irritable person is ugly\
> and they sleep badly.\
> When they get what they need,\
> they take it to be what they don't need.
>
> An angry person\
> kills with body or speech;\
> overcome with anger,\
> they lose their wealth.
>
> Mad with anger,\
> they fall into disgrace.\
> Family, friends, and loved ones\
> avoid an irritable person.
>
> Anger creates harm;\
> anger upsets the mind.\
> That person doesn't recognize\
> the danger that arises within.
>
> An angry person doesn't know the good.\
> An angry person doesn't see the truth.\
> When a person is beset by anger,\
> only blind darkness is left.
>
> An angry person destroys with ease\
> what was hard to build.\
> Afterwards, when the anger is spent,\
> they're tormented as if burnt by fire.
>
> Their look betrays their sulkiness\

## The Great Chapter

### AN 7.65 Conscience and Prudence  *Hirīottappasutta*

"Mendicants, when there is no conscience and prudence, one who lacks
conscience and prudence has destroyed a vital condition for sense
restraint. When there is no sense restraint, one who lacks sense
restraint has destroyed a vital condition for ethical conduct. When
there is no ethical conduct, one who lacks ethics has destroyed a vital
condition for right immersion. When there is no right immersion, one who
lacks right immersion has destroyed a vital condition for true knowledge
and vision. When there is no true knowledge and vision, one who lacks
true knowledge and vision has destroyed a vital condition for
disillusionment and dispassion. When there is no disillusionment and
dispassion, one who lacks disillusionment and dispassion has destroyed a
vital condition for knowledge and vision of freedom.

Suppose there was a tree that lacked branches and foliage. Its shoots,
bark, softwood, and heartwood would not grow to fullness.

In the same way, when there is no conscience and prudence, a person who
lacks conscience and prudence has destroyed a vital condition for sense
restraint. When there is no sense restraint, one who lacks sense
restraint has destroyed a vital condition for ethical conduct. When
there is no ethical conduct, one who lacks ethics has destroyed a vital
condition for right immersion. When there is no right immersion, one who
lacks right immersion has destroyed a vital condition for true knowledge
and vision. When there is no true knowledge and vision, one who lacks
true knowledge and vision has destroyed a vital condition for
disillusionment and dispassion. When there is no disillusionment and
dispassion, one who lacks disillusionment and dispassion has destroyed a
vital condition for knowledge and vision of freedom.

When there is conscience and prudence, a person who has fulfilled
conscience and prudence has fulfilled a vital condition for sense
restraint. When there is sense restraint, one who has fulfilled sense
restraint has fulfilled a vital condition for ethical conduct. When
there is ethical conduct, one who has fulfilled ethical conduct has
fulfilled a vital condition for right immersion. When there is right
immersion, one who has fulfilled right immersion has fulfilled a vital
condition for true knowledge and vision. When there is true knowledge
and vision, one who has fulfilled true knowledge and vision has
fulfilled a vital condition for disillusionment and dispassion. When
there is disillusionment and dispassion, one who has fulfilled
disillusionment and dispassion has fulfilled a vital condition for
knowledge and vision of freedom.

Suppose there was a tree that was complete with branches and foliage.
Its shoots, bark, softwood, and heartwood would grow to fullness.

In the same way, when there is conscience and prudence, one who has
fulfilled conscience and prudence has fulfilled a vital condition for
sense restraint. ... One who has fulfilled disillusionment and
dispassion has fulfilled a vital condition for knowledge and vision of
freedom."

### AN 7.66 The Seven Suns  *Sattasūriyasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Vesālī, in Ambapālī's Mango Grove. There the
Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, conditions are impermanent. Conditions are unstable.
Conditions are unreliable. This is quite enough for you to become
disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions.

Sineru, the king of mountains, is 84,000 leagues long and 84,000 leagues
wide. It sinks 84,000 leagues below the ocean and rises 84,000 leagues
above it. There comes a time when, after a very long period has
passed---many years, many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of
thousands of years---the heavens fail to rain. When this happens, the
plants and seeds, the herbs, grass, and big trees wither away and dry
up, and are no more. So impermanent are conditions, so unstable, so
unreliable. This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned,
dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions.

There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a second
sun appears. When this happens, the streams and pools wither away and
dry up, and are no more. So impermanent are conditions ...

There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a third
sun appears. When this happens, the great rivers---the Ganges,
Yamunā, Aciravatī, Sarabhū, and
Mahī---wither away and dry up, and are no more. So
impermanent are conditions ...

There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a fourth
sun appears. When this happens, the great lakes from which the rivers
originate---the Anotattā, Sīhapapātā,
Rathakārā, Kaṇṇamuṇḍā, Kuṇālā,
Chaddantā, and Mandākinī---wither away and dry
up, and are no more. So impermanent are conditions ...

There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a fifth
sun appears. When this happens, the water in the ocean sinks by a
hundred leagues. It sinks by two, three, four, five, six, or even seven
hundred leagues. The water that remains in the ocean is only seven palm
trees deep. It's six, five, four, three, two, or even one palm tree
deep. The water that remains in the ocean is only seven fathoms deep.
It's six, five, four, three, two, one or even half a fathom deep. It's
waist high, knee high, or even ankle high. It's like in autumn, when the
heavens rain heavily and water remains here and there in the cows'
hoofprints. In the same way, water in the ocean remains here and there
in puddles like cows' hoofprints. When the fifth sun appears there's not
even enough water left in the great ocean for the tip of the toe. So
impermanent are conditions ...

There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a sixth
sun appears. When this happens, this great earth and Sineru the king of
mountains smoke and smolder and give off fumes. It's like when a
potter's kiln is first kindled, and it smokes and smolders and gives off
fumes. In the same way, this great earth and Sineru the king of
mountains smoke and smolder and give off fumes. So impermanent are
conditions ...

There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a seventh
sun appears. When this happens, this great earth and Sineru the king of
mountains erupt in one burning mass of fire. And as they blaze and burn
the flames are swept by the wind as far as the realm of divinity. Sineru
the king of mountains blazes and burns, crumbling as it's overcome by
the great fire. And meanwhile, mountain peaks a hundred leagues high, or
two, three, four, or five hundred leagues high disintegrate as they
burn. And when the great earth and Sineru the king of mountains blaze
and burn, no soot or ash is found. It's like when ghee or oil blaze and
burn, and neither ashes nor soot are found. In the same way, when the
great earth and Sineru the king of mountains blaze and burn, no soot or
ash is found. So impermanent are conditions, so unstable are conditions,
so unreliable are conditions. This is quite enough for you to become
disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions.

Mendicants, who would ever think or believe that this earth and Sineru,
king of mountains, will burn and crumble and be no more, except for one
who has seen the truth?

Once upon a time, there was a teacher called Sunetta. He was a religious
founder and was free of desire for sensual pleasures. He had many
hundreds of disciples. He taught them the path to rebirth in the company
of Divinity. Those who totally understood Sunetta's teachings
were---when their body broke up, after death---reborn in a good place,
the company of Divinity. Of those who didn't totally understand
Sunetta's teachings, some---when their body broke up, after death---were
reborn in the company of the gods who control what is imagined by
others. Some were reborn in the company of the gods who love to imagine,
some with the joyful gods, some with the gods of Yama, some with the
gods of the thirty-three, and some with the gods of the four great
kings. Some were reborn in the company of well-to-do aristocrats or
brahmins or householders.

Then the teacher Sunetta thought: 'It's not proper for me to be reborn
in the next life in exactly the same place as my disciples. Why don't I
further develop love?'

Then Sunetta developed love for seven years. Having done so he did not
return to this world for seven eons of cosmic expansion and contraction.
As the cosmos contracted he went to the realm of streaming radiance. As
it expanded he was reborn in an empty mansion of divinity. There he was
the Divinity, the Great Divinity, the vanquisher, the unvanquished, the
universal seer, the wielder of power. He was Sakka, lord of gods,
thirty-six times. Many hundreds of times he was a king, a wheel-turning
monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extended to all four
sides, he achieved stability in the country, and he possessed the seven
treasures. He had over a thousand sons who were valiant and heroic,
crushing the armies of his enemies. After conquering this land girt by
sea, he reigned by principle, without rod or sword. Yet even though
Sunetta lived so long, he was not exempt from rebirth, old age, and
death. He was not exempt from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and
distress, I say.

Why is that? Because of not understanding and not penetrating four
things. What four? Noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom. These
noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom have been understood and
comprehended. Craving for continued existence has been cut off; the
conduit to rebirth is ended; now there'll be no more future lives."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "Ethics, immersion, and wisdom,\
> and the supreme freedom:\
> these things have been understood\
> by Gotama the renowned.
>
> And so the Buddha, having insight,\
> explained this teaching to the mendicants.\
> The Teacher has made an end of suffering;\
> seeing clearly, he is quenched."

### AN 7.67 The Simile of the Citadel  *Nagaropamasutta*

"Mendicants, when a king's frontier citadel is well provided with seven
essentials and gets four kinds of sustenance when needed, without
trouble or difficulty, it is then called a king's frontier citadel that
cannot be overrun by external foes and enemies.

With what seven essentials is a citadel well provided?

Firstly, a citadel has a pillar with deep foundations, firmly embedded,
imperturbable and unshakable. This is the first essential with which a
king's frontier citadel is well provided, to defend those within and
repel those outside.

Furthermore, a citadel has a moat that is deep and wide. This is the
second essential ...

Furthermore, a citadel has a patrol path that is high and wide. This is
the third essential ...

Furthermore, a citadel has stores of many weapons, both projectile and
hand-held. This is the fourth essential ...

Furthermore, many kinds of armed forces reside in a citadel, such as
elephant riders, cavalry, charioteers, archers, bannermen, adjutants,
food servers, warrior-chiefs, princes, chargers, great warriors, heroes,
leather-clad soldiers, and sons of bondservants. This is the fifth
essential ...

Furthermore, a citadel has a gatekeeper who is astute, competent, and
intelligent. He keeps strangers out and lets known people in. This is
the sixth essential ...

Furthermore, a citadel has a wall that's high and wide, covered with
plaster. This is the seventh essential with which a king's frontier
citadel is well provided, to defend those within and repel those
outside.

With these seven essentials a citadel is well provided.

What are the four kinds of sustenance it gets when needed, without
trouble or difficulty?

Firstly, a king's frontier citadel has much hay, wood, and water stored
up for the enjoyment, relief, and comfort of those within and to repel
those outside.

Furthermore, a king's frontier citadel has much rice and barley stored
up for those within.

Furthermore, a king's frontier citadel has much food such as sesame,
green gram, and black gram stored up for those within.

Furthermore, a king's frontier citadel has much medicine---ghee, butter,
oil, honey, molasses, and salt---stored up for the enjoyment, relief,
and comfort of those within and to repel those outside.

These are the four kinds of sustenance it gets when needed, without
trouble or difficulty.

When a king's frontier citadel is well provided with seven essentials
and gets four kinds of sustenance when needed, without trouble or
difficulty, it is then called a king's frontier citadel that cannot be
overrun by external foes and enemies. In the same way, when a noble
disciple has seven good qualities, and they get the four
absorptions---blissful meditations in this life that belong to the
higher mind---when they want, without trouble or difficulty, they are
then called a noble disciple who cannot be overrun by Māra,
who cannot be overrun by the Wicked One. What are the seven good
qualities that they have?

Just as a king's frontier citadel has a pillar with deep foundations,
firmly embedded, imperturbable and unshakable, to defend those within
and repel those outside, in the same way a noble disciple has faith in
the Realized One's awakening: 'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully
awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of
the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods
and humans, awakened, blessed.' A noble disciple with faith as their
pillar gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful, they give up
the blameworthy and develop the blameless, and they keep themselves
pure. This is the first good quality they have.

Just as a citadel has a moat that is deep and wide, in the same way a
noble disciple has a conscience. They're conscientious about bad conduct
by way of body, speech, and mind, and conscientious about having any
bad, unskillful qualities. A noble disciple with a conscience as their
moat gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful, they give up the
blameworthy and develop the blameless, and they keep themselves pure.
This is the second good quality they have.

Just as a citadel has a patrol path that is high and wide, in the same
way a noble disciple is prudent. They're prudent when it comes to bad
conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and prudent when it comes to
acquiring any bad, unskillful qualities. A noble disciple with prudence
as their patrol path gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful,
they give up the blameworthy and develop the blameless, and they keep
themselves pure. This is the third good quality they have.

Just as a citadel has stores of many weapons, both projectile and
hand-held, in the same way a noble disciple is very learned. They
remember and keep what they've learned. These teachings are good in the
beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and
well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that's entirely full and
pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them,
reciting them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them
theoretically. A noble disciple with learning as their weapon gives up
the unskillful and develops the skillful, they give up the blameworthy
and develop the blameless, and they keep themselves pure. This is the
fourth good quality they have.

Just as many kinds of armed forces reside in a citadel ... in the same
way a noble disciple is energetic. They live with energy roused up for
giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They
are strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to
developing skillful qualities. A noble disciple with energy as their
armed forces gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful, they
give up the blameworthy and develop the blameless, and they keep
themselves pure. This is the fifth good quality they have.

Just as a citadel has a gatekeeper who is astute, competent, and
intelligent, who keeps strangers out and lets known people in, in the
same way a noble disciple is mindful. They have utmost mindfulness and
alertness, and can remember and recall what was said and done long ago.
A noble disciple with mindfulness as their gatekeeper gives up the
unskillful and develops the skillful, they give up the blameworthy and
develop the blameless, and they keep themselves pure. This is the sixth
good quality they have.

Just as a citadel has a wall that's high and wide, covered with plaster,
to defend those within and repel those outside, in the same way a noble
disciple is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which
is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. A
noble disciple with wisdom as their wall gives up the unskillful and
develops the skillful, they give up the blameworthy and develop the
blameless, and they keep themselves pure. This is the seventh good
quality they have. These are the seven good qualities that they have.

And what are the four absorptions---blissful meditations in this life
that belong to the higher mind---that they get when they want, without
trouble or difficulty? Just as a king's frontier citadel has much hay,
wood, and water stored up for the enjoyment, relief, and comfort of
those within and to repel those outside, in the same way a noble
disciple, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which
has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and
keeping it connected. This is for their own enjoyment, relief, and
comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment.

Just as a king's frontier citadel has much rice and barley stored up, in
the same way, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are
stilled, a noble disciple enters and remains in the second absorption,
which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity
and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. This
is for their own enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon
extinguishment.

Just as a king's frontier citadel has much food such as sesame, green
gram, and black gram stored up, in the same way with the fading away of
rapture, a noble disciple enters and remains in the third absorption,
where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally
experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, 'Equanimous and
mindful, one meditates in bliss.' This is for their own enjoyment,
relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment.

Just as a king's frontier citadel has much medicine---ghee, butter, oil,
honey, molasses, and salt---stored up for the enjoyment, relief, and
comfort of those within and to repel those outside, in the same way,
giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a
noble disciple enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without
pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. This is for
their own enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon
extinguishment. These are the four absorptions---blissful meditations in
this life that belong to the higher mind---which they get when they
want, without trouble or difficulty.

When a noble disciple has seven good qualities, and they get the four
absorptions---blissful meditations in this life that belong to the
higher mind---when they want, without trouble or difficulty, they are
then called a noble disciple who cannot be overrun by Māra,
who cannot be overrun by the Wicked One."

### AN 7.68 One Who Knows the Teachings  *Dhammaññūsutta*

"A mendicant with seven qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to
the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy
of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for
the world. What seven? It's when a mendicant knows the teachings, knows
the meaning, has self-knowledge, knows moderation, knows the right time,
knows assemblies, and knows people high and low.

And how is a mendicant one who knows the teachings? It's when a
mendicant knows the teachings: statements, mixed prose & verse,
discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past
lives, amazing stories, and elaborations. If a mendicant did not know
these teachings, they would not be called 'one who knows the teachings'.
But because they do know these teachings, they are called 'one who knows
the teachings'. Such is the one who knows the teachings.

And how are they one who knows the meaning? It's when a mendicant knows
the meaning of this or that statement: 'This is what that statement
means; that is what this statement means.' If a mendicant did not know
the meaning of this or that statement, they would not be called 'one who
knows the meaning'. But because they do know the meaning of this or that
statement, they are called 'one who knows the meaning'. Such is the one
who knows the teachings and the one who knows the meaning.

And how are they one who has self-knowledge? It's when a mendicant has
self-knowledge: 'This is the extent of my faith, ethics, learning,
generosity, wisdom, and eloquence.' If a mendicant did not have
self-knowledge, they would not be called 'one who has self-knowledge'.
But because they do have self-knowledge, they are called 'one who has
self-knowledge'. Such is the one who knows the teachings, the one who
knows the meaning, and the one who has self-knowledge.

And how are they one who knows moderation? It's when a mendicant knows
moderation when receiving robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and
supplies for the sick. If a mendicant did not know moderation, they
would not be called 'one who knows moderation'. But because they do know
moderation, they are called 'one who knows moderation'. Such is the one
who knows the teachings, the one who knows the meaning, the one who has
self-knowledge, and the one who knows moderation.

And how are they one who knows the right time? It's when a mendicant
knows the right time: 'This is the time for recitation; this is the time
for questioning; this is the time for meditation; this is the time for
retreat.' If a mendicant did not know the right time, they would not be
called 'one who knows the right time'. But because they do know the
right time, they are called 'one who knows the right time'. Such is the
one who knows the teachings, the one who knows the meaning, the one who
has self-knowledge, the one who knows moderation, and the one who knows
the right time.

And how are they one who knows assemblies? It's when a mendicant knows
assemblies: 'This is an assembly of aristocrats, of brahmins, of
householders, or of ascetics. This one should be approached in this way.
This is how to stand, to act, to sit, to speak, or to stay silent when
there.' If a mendicant did not know assemblies, they would not be called
'one who knows assemblies'. But because they do know assemblies, they
are called 'one who knows assemblies'. Such is the one who knows the
teachings, the one who knows the meaning, the one who has
self-knowledge, the one who knows moderation, the one who knows the
right time, and the one who knows assemblies.

And how are they one who knows people high and low? It's when a
mendicant understands people in terms of pairs. Two people: one likes to
see the noble ones, one does not. The person who doesn't like to see the
noble ones is reprehensible in that respect. The person who does like to
see the noble ones is praiseworthy in that respect.

Two people like to see the noble ones: one likes to hear the true
teaching, one does not. The person who doesn't like to hear the true
teaching is reprehensible in that respect. The person who does like to
hear the true teaching is praiseworthy in that respect.

Two people like to hear the true teaching: one actively listens to the
teaching, one does not. The person who doesn't actively listen to the
teaching is reprehensible in that respect. The person who does actively
listen to the teaching is praiseworthy in that respect.

Two people actively listen to the teaching: one remembers the teaching
they've heard, one does not. The person who doesn't remember the
teaching they've heard is reprehensible in that respect. The person who
does remember the teaching they've heard is praiseworthy in that
respect.

Two people remember the teaching they've heard: one reflects on the
meaning of the teachings they have remembered, one does not. The person
who does not reflect on the meaning of the teachings they have
remembered is reprehensible in that respect. The person who does reflect
on the meaning of the teachings they have remembered is praiseworthy in
that respect.

Two people reflect on the meaning of the teachings they have remembered:
one understands the meaning and the teaching and practices accordingly,
one understands the meaning and the teaching but does not practice
accordingly. The person who understands the meaning and the teaching but
does not practice accordingly is reprehensible in that respect. The
person who understands the meaning and the teaching and practices
accordingly is praiseworthy in that respect.

Two people understand the meaning and the teaching and practice
accordingly: one practices to benefit themselves but not others, and one
practices to benefit both themselves and others. The person who
practices to benefit themselves but not others is reprehensible in that
respect. The person who practices to benefit both themselves and others
is praiseworthy in that respect.

That's how a mendicant understands people in terms of pairs.

That's how a mendicant is one who knows people high and low. A mendicant
with these seven qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods,
worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of
veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the
world."

### AN 7.69 The Shady Orchid Tree  *Pāricchattakasutta*

"Mendicants, when the leaves on the Shady Orchid Tree belonging to the
gods of the thirty-three turn brown, the gods are elated. They think:
'Now the leaves on the Shady Orchid Tree have turned brown! It won't be
long until they fall.'

When the leaves have fallen, the gods are elated. They think: 'Now the
leaves on the Shady Orchid Tree have fallen. It won't be long until its
foliage starts to regrow.'

When the foliage starts to regrow, the gods are elated. They think: 'Now
the foliage of the Shady Orchid Tree has started to regrow. It won't be
long until it's ready to grow flowers and leaves separately.'

When it's ready to grow flowers and leaves separately, the gods are
elated. They think: 'Now the Shady Orchid Tree is ready to grow flowers
and leaves separately. It won't be long until buds start to form.'

When the buds start to form, the gods are elated. They think: 'Now the
buds of the Shady Orchid Tree have started to form. It won't be long
until the buds burst.'

When the buds have burst, the gods are elated. They think: 'Now the buds
of the Shady Orchid Tree have burst. It won't be long until it fully
blossoms.'

When the Shady Orchid Tree of the gods of the thirty-three has fully
blossomed, the gods are elated. For four heavenly months they amused
themselves at the root of the tree, supplied and provided with the five
kinds of sensual stimulation. When the Shady Orchid Tree has fully
blossomed, its radiance spreads for fifty leagues, while its fragrance
wafts for a hundred leagues. Such is the majesty of the Shady Orchid
Tree.

In the same way, when a noble disciple plans to go forth from the lay
life to homelessness, they're like the Shady Orchid Tree when its leaves
turn brown.

When a noble disciple shaves off their hair and beard, dresses in ocher
robes, and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, they're like
the Shady Orchid Tree when its leaves fall.

When a noble disciple, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded
from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption,
which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the
mind and keeping it connected, they're like the Shady Orchid Tree when
its foliage starts to regrow.

When, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a
noble disciple enters and remains in the second absorption, which has
the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind
at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected, they're like
the Shady Orchid Tree when it's ready to grow flowers and leaves
separately.

When, with the fading away of rapture, a noble disciple enters and
remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity,
mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble
ones declare, 'Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss', they're
like the Shady Orchid Tree when its buds start to form.

When, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and
sadness, a noble disciple enters and remains in the fourth absorption,
without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness, they're
like the Shady Orchid Tree when its buds burst.

When a noble disciple realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and
freedom by wisdom in this very life, and they live having realized it
with their own insight due to the ending of defilements, they're like
the Shady Orchid tree when it fully blossoms.

At that time the earth gods raise the cry: 'This venerable named
so-and-so, from such-and-such village or town, the protégé of the
venerable named so-and-so, went forth from the lay life to homelessness.
They've realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in
this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight
due to the ending of defilements.'

Hearing the cry of the earth gods, the gods of the four great kings ...
the gods of the thirty-three ... the gods of Yama ... the joyful gods
... the gods who love to imagine ... the gods who control what is
imagined by others ... the gods of the Divinity's host raise the cry:
'This venerable named so-and-so, from such-and-such village or town, the
protégé of the venerable named so-and-so, went forth from the lay life
to homelessness. They've realized the undefiled freedom of heart and
freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it
with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.' And so at that
moment, that hour, the cry soars up to the realm of divinity. Such is
the majesty of a mendicant who has ended the defilements."

### AN 7.70 Honor  *Sakkaccasutta*

Then as Venerable Sāriputta was in private retreat this
thought came to his mind, "What should a mendicant honor and respect and
rely on, to give up the unskillful and develop the skillful?"

Then he thought, "A mendicant should honor and respect and rely on the
Teacher ... the teaching ... the Saṅgha ... the training
... immersion ... diligence ... A mendicant should honor and respect and
rely on hospitality, to give up the unskillful and develop the
skillful."

Then he thought, "These qualities are pure and bright in me. Why don't I
go and tell them to the Buddha? Then these qualities will not only be
purified in me, but will be better known as purified. Suppose a man were
to acquire a gold ingot, pure and bright. They'd think, 'My gold ingot
is pure and bright. Why don't I take it to show the smiths? Then it will
not only be purified, but will be better known as purified.' In the same
way, these qualities are pure and bright in me. Why don't I go and tell
them to the Buddha? Then these qualities will not only be purified in
me, but will be better known as purified."

Then in the late afternoon, Sāriputta came out of retreat
and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and told the
Buddha of his thoughts while on retreat.

"Good, good, Sāriputta! A mendicant should honor and
respect and rely on the Teacher, to give up the unskillful and develop
the skillful. A mendicant should honor and respect and rely on the
teaching ... the Saṅgha ... the training ... immersion ...
diligence ... A mendicant should honor and respect and rely on
hospitality, to give up the unskillful and develop the skillful."

When he said this, Venerable Sāriputta said to the Buddha:

"Sir, this is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha's
brief statement. It is quite impossible for a mendicant who doesn't
respect the Teacher to respect the teaching. A mendicant who disrespects
the Teacher disrespects the teaching.

It is quite impossible for a mendicant who doesn't respect the Teacher
and the teaching to respect the Saṅgha. A mendicant who
disrespects the Teacher and the teaching disrespects the
Saṅgha.

It is quite impossible for a mendicant who doesn't respect the Teacher,
the teaching, and the Saṅgha to respect the training. A
mendicant who disrespects the Teacher, the teaching, and the
Saṅgha disrespects the training.

It is quite impossible for a mendicant who doesn't respect the Teacher,
the teaching, the Saṅgha, and the training to respect
immersion. A mendicant who disrespects the Teacher, the teaching, the
Saṅgha, and the training disrespects immersion.

It is quite impossible for a mendicant who doesn't respect the Teacher,
the teaching, the Saṅgha, the training, and immersion to
respect diligence. A mendicant who disrespects the Teacher, the
teaching, the Saṅgha, the training, and immersion
disrespects diligence.

It is quite impossible for a mendicant who doesn't respect the Teacher,
the teaching, the Saṅgha, the training, immersion, and
diligence to respect hospitality. A mendicant who disrespects the
Teacher, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the training, immersion,
and diligence disrespects hospitality.

It is quite impossible for a mendicant who does respect the Teacher to
disrespect the teaching. ...

A mendicant who respects the Teacher, the teaching, the
Saṅgha, the training, immersion, and diligence respects
hospitality.

It's quite possible for a mendicant who respects the Teacher to respect
the teaching. ...

A mendicant who respects the Teacher, the teaching, the
Saṅgha, the training, immersion, and diligence respects
hospitality.

That's how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha's brief
statement."

"Good, good, Sāriputta! It's good that you understand the
detailed meaning of what I've said in brief like this.

It is quite impossible for a mendicant who doesn't respect the Teacher
to respect the teaching. ...

A mendicant who disrespects the Teacher, the teaching, the
Saṅgha, the training, immersion, and diligence disrespects
hospitality.

It is quite impossible for a mendicant who does respect the Teacher to
disrespect the teaching. ...

A mendicant who respects the Teacher, the teaching, the

hospitality.

It's quite possible for a mendicant who does respect the Teacher to
respect the teaching. ...

A mendicant who respects the Teacher, the teaching, the
Saṅgha, the training, immersion, and diligence respects
hospitality.

This is how to understand the detailed meaning of what I said in brief."

### AN 7.71 Committed to Development  *Bhāvanāsutta*

"Mendicants, when a mendicant is not committed to development, they
might wish: 'If only my mind were freed from the defilements by not
grasping!' Even so, their mind is not freed from defilements by not
grasping. Why is that? You should say: 'It's because they're
undeveloped.' Undeveloped in what? The four kinds of mindfulness
meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the
five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the
noble eightfold path.

Suppose there was a chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs. But she
had not properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated. Even if
that chicken might wish: 'If only my chicks could break out of the
eggshell with their claws and beak and hatch safely!' Still they can't
break out and hatch safely. Why is that? Because she has not properly
sat on them to keep them warm and incubated.

Suppose a carpenter or their apprentice sees the marks of his fingers
and thumb on the handle of his adze. They don't know how much of the
handle was worn away today, how much yesterday, and how much previously.
They just know what has been worn away. In the same way, when a
mendicant is committed to development, they don't know how much of the
defilements were worn away today, how much yesterday, and how much
previously. They just know what has been worn away.

Suppose there was a sea-faring ship bound together with ropes. For six
months they deteriorated in the water. Then in the cold season it was
hauled up on dry land, where the ropes were weathered by wind and sun.
When the clouds soaked it with rain, the ropes would readily collapse
and rot away. In the same way, when a mendicant is committed to
development their fetters readily collapse and rot away."

### AN 7.72 The Simile of the Great Mass of Fire  *Aggikkhandhopamasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was wandering in
the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of
mendicants.

While walking along the road, at a certain spot he saw a great mass of
fire burning, blazing, and glowing. Seeing this he left the road, sat at
the root of a tree on a seat spread out, and addressed the mendicants,
"Mendicants, do you see that great mass of fire burning, blazing, and
glowing?"

"Yes, sir."

"What do you think, mendicants? Which is better---to sit or lie down
embracing that great mass of fire? Or to sit or lie down embracing a
girl of the aristocrats or brahmins or householders with soft and tender
hands and feet?"

"Sir, it would be much better to sit or lie down embracing a girl of the
aristocrats or brahmins or householders with soft and tender hands and
feet. For it would be painful to sit or lie down embracing that great
mass of fire."

"I declare this to you, mendicants, I announce this to you! It would be
better for that unethical man---of bad qualities, filthy, with
suspicious behavior, underhand, no true ascetic or spiritual
practitioner, though claiming to be one, rotten inside, festering, and
depraved---to sit or lie down embracing that great mass of fire. Why is
that? Because that might result in death or deadly pain. But when his
body breaks up, after death, it would not cause him to be reborn in a
place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.

But when such an unethical man sits or lies down embracing a girl of the
aristocrats or brahmins or householders with soft and tender hands and
feet, that brings him lasting harm and suffering. When his body breaks
up, after death, he's reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the
underworld, hell.

What do you think, mendicants? Which is better---to have a strong man
twist a tough horse-hair rope around both shins and tighten it so that
it cuts through your outer skin, your inner skin, your flesh, sinews,
and bones, until it reaches your marrow and keeps pushing? Or to consent
to well-to-do aristocrats or brahmins or householders bowing down to
you?"

"Sir, it would be much better to consent to well-to-do aristocrats or
brahmins or householders bowing down. For it would be painful to have a
strong man twist a tough horse-hair rope around your shins and tighten
it so that it cut through the outer skin until it reached the marrow and

well-to-do aristocrats or brahmins or householders revering you with
joined palms?"

"Sir, it would be much better to consent to well-to-do aristocrats or

sword."

wrap you up in a red-hot sheet of iron, burning, blazing, and glowing?
Or to enjoy the use of a robe given in faith by well-to-do aristocrats
or brahmins or householders?"

"Sir, it would be much better to enjoy the use of a robe given in faith
by well-to-do aristocrats or brahmins or householders. For it would be
painful to have a strong man wrap you up in a red-hot sheet of iron,
burning, blazing, and glowing."

red-hot iron bed or seat? Or to enjoy the use of beds and chairs given

burning, blazing, and glowing, where you're seared in boiling scum, and
swept up and down and round and round. Or to enjoy the use of dwellings

So you should train like this: 'Our use of robes, almsfood, lodgings,
and medicines and supplies for the sick shall be of great fruit and
benefit for those who offered them. And our going forth will not be
wasted, but will be fruitful and fertile.' That's how you should train.
Considering what is good for yourself, mendicants, is quite enough for
you to persist with diligence. Considering what is good for others is
quite enough for you to persist with diligence. Considering what is good
for both is quite enough for you to persist with diligence."

That is what the Buddha said. And while this discourse was being spoken,
sixty monks spewed hot blood from their mouths. Sixty mendicants
resigned the training and returned to a lesser life, saying:

"It's too hard, Blessed One! It's just too hard!" And sixty monks were
freed from defilements by not grasping.

### AN 7.73 About Sunetta  *Sunettasutta*

"Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a Teacher called Sunetta. He
was a religious founder and was free of desire for sensual pleasures. He
had many hundreds of disciples. He taught them the path to rebirth in
the company of Divinity. Those lacking confidence in Sunetta were---when
their body broke up, after death---reborn in a place of loss, a bad
place, the underworld, hell. Those full of confidence in Sunetta
were---when their body broke up, after death---reborn in a good place, a
heavenly realm.

Once upon a time there was a teacher called Mūgapakkha ...
Aranemi ... Kuddālaka ... Hatthipāla ...
Jotipāla ... Araka. He was a religious founder and was free
of desire for sensual pleasures. He had many hundreds of disciples. He
taught them the way to rebirth in the company of Divinity. Those lacking
confidence in Araka were---when their body broke up, after
death---reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
Those full of confidence in Araka were---when their body broke up, after
death---reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.

What do you think, mendicants? If someone with malicious intent were to
abuse and insult these seven teachers with their hundreds of followers,
would they not create much wickedness?"

"Yes, sir."

"They would indeed. But someone who abuses and insults a single person
accomplished in view with malicious intent creates even more wickedness.
Why is that? I say that any injury done by those outside of the Buddhist
community does not compare with what is done to one's own spiritual
companions.

So you should train like this: 'We will have no malicious intent for our
spiritual companions.' That's how you should train."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.74 About Araka  *Arakasutta*

"Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a Teacher called Araka. He was
a religious founder and was free of desire for sensual pleasures. He had
many hundreds of disciples, and he taught them like this: 'Brahmins,
life as a human is short, brief, and fleeting, full of suffering and
distress. Be thoughtful and wake up! Do what's good and lead the
spiritual life, for no-one born can escape death.

It's like a drop of dew on a grass tip. When the sun comes up it quickly
evaporates and doesn't last long. In the same way, life as a human is
like a dewdrop. It's brief and fleeting, full of suffering and distress.
Be thoughtful and wake up! Do what's good and lead the spiritual life,
for no-one born can escape death.

It's like when the heavens rain heavily. The bubbles quickly vanish and
don't last long. In the same way, life as a human is like a bubble. ...

It's like a line drawn in water. It vanishes quickly and doesn't last
long. In the same way, life as a human is like a line drawn in water.
...

It's like a mountain river traveling far, flowing fast, carrying all
before it. It doesn't turn back---not for a moment, a second, an
hour---but runs, rolls, and flows on. In the same way, life as a human
is like a mountain river. ...

It's like a strong man who has formed a glob of spit on the tip of his
tongue. He could easily spit it out. In the same way, life as a human is
like a glob of spit. ...

Suppose there was an iron cauldron that had been heated all day. If you
tossed a scrap of meat in, it would quickly vanish and not last long. In
the same way, life as a human is like a scrap of meat. ...

It's like a cow being led to the slaughterhouse. With every step she
comes closer to the slaughter, closer to death. In the same way, life as
a human is like a cow being slaughtered. It's brief and fleeting, full
of suffering and distress. Be thoughtful and wake up! Do what's good and
lead the spiritual life, for no-one born can escape death.'

Now, mendicants, at that time human beings had a lifespan of 60,000
years. Girls could be married at 500 years of age. And human beings only
had six afflictions: cold, heat, hunger, thirst, and the need to
defecate and urinate. But even though humans were so long-lived with so
few afflictions, Araka still taught in this way: 'Life as a human is
short, brief, and fleeting, full of suffering and distress. Be
thoughtful and wake up! Do what's good and lead the spiritual life, for
no-one born can escape death.'

These days it'd be right to say: 'Life as a human is short, brief, and
fleeting, full of suffering and distress. Be thoughtful and wake up! Do
what's good and lead the spiritual life, for no-one born can escape
death.' For these days a long life is a hundred years or a little more.
Living for a hundred years, there are just three hundred seasons, a
hundred each of the winter, summer, and rains. Living for three hundred
seasons, there are just twelve hundred months, four hundred in each of
the winter, summer, and rains. Living for twelve hundred months, there
are just twenty-four hundred fortnights, eight hundred in each of the
winter, summer, and rains. Living for 2,400 fortnights, there are just
36,000 days, 12,000 in each of the summer, winter, and rains. Living for
36,000 days, you just eat 72,000 meals, 24,000 in each of the summer,
winter, and rains, including when you're suckling at the breast, and
when you're prevented from eating.

Things that prevent you from eating include anger, pain, sickness,
sabbath, or being unable to get food. So mendicants, for a human being
with a hundred years lifespan I have counted the lifespan, the limit of
the lifespan, the seasons, the years, the months, the fortnights, the
nights, the days, the meals, and the things that prevent them from
eating. Out of sympathy, I've done what a teacher should do who wants
what's best for their disciples. Here are these roots of trees, and here
are these empty huts. Practice absorption, mendicants! Don't be
negligent! Don't regret it later! This is my instruction to you."

is not an offense. They know what is a light offense. They know what is
a serious offense. They recollect their many kinds of past lives, with
features and details. With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman,
they understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.
They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in
this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due
to the ending of defilements. A mendicant with these seven qualities
shines as an expert in the monastic law."

### AN 7.83 The Teacher's Instructions  *Satthusāsanasutta*

Then Venerable Upāli went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down
to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I've heard
it, I'll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute."

"Upāli, you might know that certain things don't lead
solely to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight,
awakening, and extinguishment. Categorically, you should remember these
things as not the teaching, not the training, and not the Teacher's
instructions. You might know that certain things do lead solely to
disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and
extinguishment. Categorically, you should remember these things as the
teaching, the training, and the Teacher's instructions."

granted. Resolution because of past insanity to be granted. Acting
according to what has been admitted. Majority decision. Further penalty.
Covering over as if with grass. These are the seven principles for the
settlement of any disciplinary issues that might arise."

with wisdom. They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by
wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their
own insight due to the ending of defilements. This is the first person

# The Book of the Eights


## The Chapter on Love

### AN 8.1 The Benefits of Love  *Mettāsutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, you can expect eight benefits when the heart's release by
love has been cultivated, developed, and practiced, made a vehicle and a
basis, kept up, consolidated, and properly implemented. What eight? You
sleep at ease. You wake happily. You don't have bad dreams. Humans love
you. Non-humans love you. Deities protect you. You can't be harmed by
fire, poison, or blade. If you don't reach any higher, you'll be reborn
in a realm of divinity. You can expect these eight benefits when the
heart's release by love has been cultivated, developed, and practiced,
made a vehicle and a basis, kept up, consolidated, and properly
implemented.

> A mindful one who develops\
> limitless love\
> weakens the fetters,\
> seeing the ending of attachments.
>
> Loving just one creature with a hateless heart\
> makes you a true person.\
> Sympathetic for all creatures,\
> a noble one creates abundant merit.
>
> The royal potentates conquered this land\
> and traveled around sponsoring sacrifices---\
> horse sacrifice, human sacrifice,\
> the sacrifices of the 'casting of the yoke-pin', the 'royal soma
> drinking', and the 'unimpeded'.
>
> These are not worth a sixteenth part\
> of the mind developed with love,\
> as all the constellations of stars\
> aren't worth a sixteenth part of the moon's light.
>
> Don't kill or cause others to kill,\
> don't conquer or encourage others to conquer,\
> with love for all sentient beings,\
> you'll have no enmity for anyone."

### AN 8.2 Wisdom  *Paññāsutta*

"Mendicants, there are eight causes and reasons that lead to acquiring
the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life, and to its increase,
growth, and full development once it has been acquired. What eight?

It's when a mendicant lives relying on the Teacher or a spiritual
companion in a teacher's role. And they set up a keen sense of
conscience and prudence for them, with warmth and respect. This is the
first cause.

When a mendicant lives relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion
in a teacher's role---with a keen sense of conscience and prudence for
them, with warmth and respect---from time to time they go and ask them
questions: 'Why, sir, does it say this? What does that mean?' Those
venerables clarify what is unclear, reveal what is obscure, and dispel
doubt regarding the many doubtful matters. This is the second cause.

After hearing that teaching they perfect withdrawal of both body and
mind. This is the third cause.

A mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting
themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger
in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they've undertaken. This is
the fourth cause.

They're very learned, remembering and keeping what they've learned.
These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good
in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice
that's entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings,
remembering them, rehearsing them, mentally scrutinizing them, and
comprehending them theoretically. This is the fifth cause.

They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and
embracing skillful qualities. They're strong, staunchly vigorous, not
slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. This is the
sixth cause.

When in the Saṅgha they don't engage in motley talk or low
talk. Either they talk on Dhamma, or they invite someone else to do so,
or they respect noble silence. This is the seventh cause.

They meditate observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates.
'Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form.
Such is feeling, such is the origin of feeling, such is the ending of
feeling. Such is perception, such is the origin of perception, such is
the ending of perception. Such are choices, such is the origin of
choices, such is the ending of choices. Such is consciousness, such is
the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.' This
is the eighth cause.

Their spiritual companions esteem them: 'This venerable lives relying on
the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher's role. They set up a
keen sense of conscience and prudence for them, with warmth and respect.
Clearly this venerable knows and sees.' This quality leads to fondness,
respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.

'This venerable lives relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion in
a teacher's role, and from time to time they go and ask them questions
... Clearly this venerable knows and sees.' This quality also leads to
fondness, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.

'After hearing that teaching they perfect withdrawal of both body and
mind. Clearly this venerable knows and sees.' This quality also leads to
fondness, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.

'This venerable is ethical ... Clearly this venerable knows and sees.'
This quality also leads to fondness, respect, esteem, harmony, and
unity.

'This venerable is very learned, remembering and keeping what they've
learned. ... Clearly this venerable knows and sees.' This quality also
leads to fondness, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.

'This venerable lives with energy roused up ... Clearly this venerable
knows and sees.' This quality also leads to fondness, respect, esteem,
harmony, and unity.

'When in the Saṅgha they don't engage in motley talk or low
talk. Either they talk on Dhamma, or they invite someone else to do so,
or they respect noble silence. Clearly this venerable knows and sees.'
This quality also leads to fondness, respect, esteem, harmony, and
unity.

'They meditate observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates.
... Clearly this venerable knows and sees.' This quality also leads to
fondness, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.

These are the eight causes and reasons that lead to acquiring the wisdom
fundamental to the spiritual life, and to its increase, growth, and full
development once it has been acquired."

### AN 8.3 Disliked (1st)  *Paṭhamaappiyasutta*

"Mendicants, a mendicant with eight qualities is disliked and
disapproved by their spiritual companions, not respected or admired.
What eight? It's when a mendicant praises the disliked and criticizes
the liked. They desire material things and honor. They lack conscience
and prudence. They have corrupt wishes and wrong view. A mendicant with
these eight qualities is disliked and disapproved by their spiritual
companions, not respected or admired.

A mendicant with eight qualities is liked and approved by their
spiritual companions, and respected and admired. What eight? It's when a
mendicant doesn't praise the disliked and criticize the liked. They
don't desire material things and honor. They have conscience and
prudence. They have few desires and right view. A mendicant with these
eight qualities is liked and approved by their spiritual companions, and
respected and admired."

<!--pg-->
### AN 8.4 Disliked (2nd)  *Dutiyaappiyasutta*

"Mendicants, a mendicant with eight qualities is disliked and
disapproved by their spiritual companions, not respected or admired.
What eight? It's when a mendicant desires material things, honor, and
status. They know neither moderation nor the proper time. Their conduct
is impure, they talk a lot, and they insult and abuse their spiritual
companions. A mendicant with these eight qualities is disliked and
disapproved by their spiritual companions, not respected or admired.

<!--pg-->
### AN 8.5 Worldly Conditions (1st)  *Paṭhamalokadhammasutta*

"Mendicants, the eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and
the world revolves around the eight worldly conditions. What eight? Gain
and loss, fame and disgrace, blame and praise, pleasure and pain. These
eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and the world
revolves around these eight worldly conditions.

> Gain and loss, fame and disgrace,\
> blame and praise, and pleasure and pain.\
> These qualities among people are impermanent,\
> transient, and perishable.
>
> An intelligent and mindful person knows these things,\
> seeing that they're perishable.\
> Desirable things don't disturb their mind,\
> nor are they repelled by the undesirable.
>
> Both favoring and opposing\
> are cleared and ended, they are no more.\
> Knowing the stainless, sorrowless state,\
> they who have gone beyond rebirth\
> \>understand rightly."

<!--pg-->
### AN 8.6 Worldly Conditions (2nd)  *Dutiyalokadhammasutta*

"Mendicants, the eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and
the world revolves around the eight worldly conditions. What eight? Gain
and loss, fame and disgrace, blame and praise, pleasure and pain. These
eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and the world
revolves around these eight worldly conditions.

An unlearned ordinary person encounters gain and loss, fame and
disgrace, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain. And so does a learned
noble disciple. What, then, is the difference between a learned noble
disciple and an ordinary unlearned person?"

"Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge.
Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The
mendicants will listen and remember it."

"Well then, mendicants, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, an unlearned ordinary person encounters gain. They don't
reflect: 'I've encountered this gain. It's impermanent, suffering, and
perishable.' They don't truly understand it. They encounter loss ...
fame ... disgrace ... blame ... praise ... pleasure ... pain. They don't
reflect: 'I've encountered this pain. It's impermanent, suffering, and
perishable.' They don't truly understand it.

So gain and loss, fame and disgrace, blame and praise, and pleasure and
pain occupy their mind. They favor gain and oppose loss. They favor fame
and oppose disgrace. They favor praise and oppose blame. They favor
pleasure and oppose pain. Being so full of favoring and opposing,
they're not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow,
lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They're not freed from
suffering, I say.

A learned noble disciple encounters gain. They reflect: 'I've
encountered this gain. It's impermanent, suffering, and perishable.'
They truly understand it. They encounter loss ... fame ... disgrace ...
blame ... praise ... pleasure ... pain. They reflect: 'I've encountered
this pain. It's impermanent, suffering, and perishable.' They truly
understand it.

So gain and loss, fame and disgrace, blame and praise, and pleasure and
pain don't occupy their mind. They don't favor gain or oppose loss. They
don't favor fame or oppose disgrace. They don't favor praise or oppose
blame. They don't favor pleasure or oppose pain. Having given up
favoring and opposing, they're freed from rebirth, old age, and death,
from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They're freed
from suffering, I say. This is the difference between a learned noble
disciple and an unlearned ordinary person.

> Gain and loss, fame and disgrace,\
> blame and praise, and pleasure and pain.\
> These qualities among people are impermanent,\
> transient, and perishable.
>
> An intelligent and mindful person knows these things,\
> seeing that they're perishable.\

### AN 8.7 Devadatta's Failure  *Devadattavipattisutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the
Vulture's Peak Mountain, not long after Devadatta had left. There the
Buddha spoke to the mendicants about Devadatta:

"Mendicants, it's good for a mendicant to check their own failings from
time to time. It's good for a mendicant to check the failings of others
from time to time. It's good for a mendicant to check their own
successes from time to time. It's good for a mendicant to check the
successes of others from time to time. Overcome and overwhelmed by eight
things that oppose the true teaching, Devadatta is going to a place of
loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable.

What eight? Overcome and overwhelmed by gain ... loss ... fame ...
disgrace ... honor ... dishonor ... corrupt wishes ... bad friendship,
Devadatta is going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an
eon, irredeemable. Overcome and overwhelmed by these eight things that
oppose the true teaching, Devadatta is going to a place of loss, to
hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable.

It's good for a mendicant, whenever they encounter it, to overcome gain
... loss ... fame ... disgrace ... honor ... dishonor ... corrupt wishes
... bad friendship.

What advantage does a mendicant gain by overcoming these eight things?

The distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who
lives without overcoming these eight things do not arise when they have
overcome them. This is the advantage that a mendicant gains by
overcoming these eight things.

So, mendicants, you should train like this: 'Whenever we encounter it,
we will overcome gain ... loss ... fame ... disgrace ... honor ...
dishonor ... corrupt wishes ... bad friendship.' That's how you should
train."

<!--pg-->
### AN 8.8 Uttara on Failure  *Uttaravipattisutta*

At one time Venerable Uttara was staying on the Saṅkheyyaka
Mountain in the Mahisa region near Dhavajālikā. There
Uttara addressed the mendicants: "Mendicants, it's good for a mendicant
to check their own failings from time to time. It's good for a mendicant
to check the failings of others from time to time. It's good for a
mendicant to check their own successes from time to time. It's good for
a mendicant to check the successes of others from time to time."

Now at that time the great king Vessavaṇa was on his way
from the north to the south on some business. He heard Venerable Uttara
teaching this to the mendicants on Saṅkheyyaka Mountain.

Then Vessavaṇa vanished from Saṅkheyyaka
Mountain and appeared among the gods of the thirty-three, as easily as a
strong person would extend or contract their arm. Then he went up to
Sakka, lord of gods, and said to him:

"Please sir, you should know this. Venerable Uttara is teaching the
mendicants on Saṅkheyyaka Mountain in this way: 'It's good
for a mendicant from time to time to check their own failings. ... the
failings of others ... their own successes ... the successes of
others.'"

Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm,
Sakka vanished from the gods of the thirty-three and reappeared on
Saṅkheyyaka Mountain in front of Venerable Uttara. Then
Sakka went up to Venerable Uttara, bowed, stood to one side, and said to
him:

"Is it really true, sir, that you teach the mendicants in this way:
'It's good for a mendicant from time to time to check their own failings
... the failings of others ... their own successes ... the successes of
others'?"

"Indeed, lord of gods."

"Sir, did this teaching come to you from your own inspiration, or was it
spoken by the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened
Buddha?"

"Well then, lord of gods, I shall give you a simile. For by means of a
simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said.

Suppose there was a large heap of grain not far from a town or village.
And a large crowd were to take away grain with carrying poles, baskets,
hip sacks, or their cupped hands. If someone were to go to that crowd
and ask them where they got the grain from, how should that crowd
rightly reply?"

"Sir, they should reply that they took it from the large heap of grain."

"In the same way, lord of gods, whatever is well spoken is spoken by the
Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. Both myself
and others rely completely on that when we speak."

"It's incredible, sir, it's amazing! How well this was said by Venerable
Uttara! 'Whatever is well spoken is spoken by the Blessed One, the
perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. Both myself and others rely
completely on that when we speak.' At one time, Honorable Uttara, the
Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture's Peak
Mountain, not long after Devadatta had left. There the Buddha spoke to
the mendicants about Devadatta:

'Mendicants, it's good for a mendicant from time to time to check their
own failings ... the failings of others ... their own successes ... the
successes of others. Overcome and overwhelmed by eight things that
oppose the true teaching, Devadatta is going to a place of loss, to
hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable. What eight? Overcome and
overwhelmed by gain ... loss ... fame ... disgrace ... honor ...
dishonor ... corrupt wishes ... bad friendship, Devadatta is going to a
place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable.
Overcome and overwhelmed by these eight things that oppose the true
teaching, Devadatta is going to a place of loss, to hell, there to
remain for an eon, irredeemable.

It's good for a mendicant, whenever they encounter it, to overcome gain
... loss ... fame ... disgrace ... honor ... dishonor ... corrupt wishes
... bad friendship.

What advantage does a mendicant gain by overcoming these eight things?

The distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who
lives without overcoming these eight things do not arise when they have
overcome them. This is the advantage that a mendicant gains by
overcoming these eight things.

So you should train like this:

"Whenever we encounter it, we will overcome gain ... loss ... fame ...
disgrace ... honor ... dishonor ... corrupt wishes ... bad friendship."
That's how you should train.'

Honorable Uttara, this exposition of the teaching is not established
anywhere in the four assemblies---monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.
Sir, learn this exposition of the teaching! Memorize this exposition of
the teaching! Remember this exposition of the teaching! Sir, this
exposition of the teaching is beneficial and relates to the fundamentals
of the spiritual life."

<!--pg-->
### AN 8.9 Nanda  *Nandasutta*

"Mendicants, you could rightly call Nanda 'Gentleman', 'strong',
'lovely', and 'lustful'. How could he live the full and pure spiritual
life unless he guards the sense doors, eats in moderation, is dedicated
to wakefulness, and has mindfulness and situational awareness?

This is how Nanda guards the sense doors. If he has to look to the east,
he wholeheartedly concentrates before looking, thinking: 'When I look to
the east, bad, unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure will
not overwhelm me.' In this way he's aware of the situation.

If he has to look to the west ... north ... south ... up ... down ... If
he has to survey the intermediate directions, he wholeheartedly
concentrates before looking, thinking: 'When I survey the intermediate
directions, bad, unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure
will not overwhelm me.' In this way he's aware of the situation. This is
how Nanda guards the sense doors.

This is how Nanda eats in moderation. Nanda reflects rationally on the
food he eats: 'Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but
only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual
practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give
rise to new discomfort, and I will have the means to keep going,
blamelessness, and a comfortable abiding.' This is how Nanda eats in
moderation.

This is how Nanda is committed to wakefulness. Nanda practices walking
and sitting meditation by day, purifying his mind from obstacles. In the
first watch of the night, he continues to practice walking and sitting
meditation. In the middle watch, he lies down in the lion's posture---on
the right side, placing one foot on top of the other---mindful and
aware, and focused on the time of getting up. In the last watch, he gets
up and continues to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying
his mind from obstacles. This is how Nanda is committed to wakefulness.

This is how Nanda has mindfulness and situational awareness. Nanda knows
feelings as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. He knows
perceptions as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. He knows
thoughts as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. This is how
Nanda has mindfulness and situational awareness.

How could Nanda live the full and pure spiritual life unless he guards
the sense doors, eats in moderation, is dedicated to wakefulness, and
has mindfulness and situational awareness?"

### AN 8.10 Trash  *Kāraṇḍavasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks
of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. Now at that time the mendicants
accused a mendicant of an offense. The accused mendicant dodged the
issue, distracted the discussion with irrelevant points, and displayed
annoyance, hate, and bitterness.

Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, "Mendicants, throw this person
out! Throw this person out! This person should be shown the door. Why
should you be vexed by an outsider?

Take a case where a certain person looks just the same as other
good-natured mendicants when going out and coming back, when looking
ahead and aside, when bending and extending the limbs, and when bearing
the outer robe, bowl and robes. That is, so long as the mendicants don't
notice his offense. But when the mendicants notice the offense, they
know that he's a corrupt ascetic, just useless trash. When they realize
this they send him away. Why is that? So that he doesn't corrupt
good-natured mendicants.

Suppose in a growing field of barley some bad barley appeared, just
useless trash. Its roots, stem, and leaves would look just the same as
the healthy barley. That is, so long as the head doesn't appear. But
when the head appears, they know that it's bad barley, just useless
trash. When they realize this they pull it up by the roots and throw it
outside the field. Why is that? So that it doesn't spoil the good
barley.

In the same way, take a case where a certain person looks just the same
as other good-natured mendicants when going out and coming back, when
looking ahead and aside, when bending and extending the limbs, and when
bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes. That is, so long as the
mendicants don't notice his offense. But when the mendicants notice the
offense, they know that he's a corrupt ascetic, just useless trash. When
they realize this they send him away. Why is that? So that he doesn't
corrupt good-natured mendicants.

Suppose that a large heap of grain is being winnowed. The grains that
are firm and solid form a heap on one side. And the grains that are
flimsy and insubstantial are blown over to the other side. The owners
take a broom and sweep them even further away. Why is that? So that it
doesn't spoil the good grain. In the same way, take a case where a
certain person looks just the same as other good-natured mendicants when
going out and coming back, when looking ahead and aside, when bending
and extending the limbs, and when bearing the outer robe, bowl and
robes. That is, so long as the mendicants don't notice his offense. But
when the mendicants notice the offense, they know that he's a corrupt
ascetic, just useless trash. When they realize this they send him away.
Why is that? So that he doesn't corrupt good-natured mendicants.

Suppose a man needs an irrigation gutter for a well. He'd take a sharp
axe and enter the wood, where he'd knock various trees with the axe. The
trees that were firm and solid made a cracking sound. But the trees that
were rotten inside, decomposing and decayed, made a thud. He'd cut down
such a tree at the root, lop off the crown, and thoroughly clear out the
insides. Then he'd use it as an irrigation gutter for the well. In the
same way, take a case where a certain person looks just the same as
other good-natured mendicants when going out and coming back, when
looking ahead and aside, when bending and extending the limbs, and when
bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes. That is, so long as the
mendicants don't notice his offense. But when the mendicants notice the
offense, they know that he's a corrupt ascetic, just useless trash. When
they realize this they send him away. Why is that? So that he doesn't
corrupt good-natured mendicants.

## The Great Chapter

### AN 8.11 At Verañjā  *Verañjasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying in
Verañjā at the root of a neem tree dedicated to
Naḷeru. Then the brahmin Verañja went up to
the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and
polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the
Buddha:

"Mister Gotama, I have heard that the ascetic Gotama doesn't bow to old
brahmins, the elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have
reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or
offer them a seat. And this is indeed the case, for Mister Gotama does
not bow to old brahmins, elderly and senior, who are advanced in years
and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their
presence or offer them a seat. This is not appropriate, Mister Gotama."

"Brahmin, I don't see anyone in this world---with its gods,
Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics
and brahmins, its gods and humans---for whom I should bow down or rise
up or offer a seat. If the Realized One bowed down or rose up or offered
a seat to anyone, their head would explode!"

"Mister Gotama lacks taste."

"There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I lack
taste. For the Realized One has given up taste for sights, sounds,
smells, tastes, and touches. It's cut off at the root, made like a palm
stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. In this sense you
could rightly say that I lack taste. But that's not what you're talking
about."

"Mister Gotama is indelicate."

"There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I'm
indelicate. For the Realized One has given up delight in sights, sounds,
smells, tastes, and touches. It's cut off at the root, made like a palm
stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. In this sense you
could rightly say that I'm indelicate. But that's not what you're
talking about."

"Mister Gotama is a teacher of inaction."

"There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I'm a
teacher of inaction. For I teach inaction regarding bad bodily, verbal,
and mental conduct, and the many kinds of unskillful things. In this
sense you could rightly say that I'm a teacher of inaction. But that's
not what you're talking about."

"Mister Gotama is a teacher of annihilationism."

"There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I'm a
teacher of annihilationism. For I teach the annihilation of greed, hate,
and delusion, and the many kinds of unskillful things. In this sense you
could rightly say that I'm a teacher of annihilationism. But that's not
what you're talking about."

"Mister Gotama is disgusted."

"There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I'm
disgusted. For I'm disgusted by bad conduct by way of body, speech, and
mind, and by attainment of the many kinds of unskillful things. In this
sense you could rightly say that I'm disgusted. But that's not what
you're talking about."

"Mister Gotama is an exterminator."

"There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I'm an
exterminator. For I teach the extermination of greed, hate, and
delusion, and the many kinds of unskillful things. In this sense you
could rightly say that I'm an exterminator. But that's not what you're
talking about."

"Mister Gotama is a mortifier."

"There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I'm a
mortifier. For I say that bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind
should be mortified. I say that a mortifier is someone who has given up
unskillful qualities that should be mortified. They've cut them off at
the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they're
unable to arise in the future. The Realized One is someone who has given
up unskillful qualities that should be mortified. He has cut them off at
the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they're
unable to arise in the future. In this sense you could rightly say that
I'm a mortifier. But that's not what you're talking about."

"Mister Gotama is immature."

"There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I'm
immature. I say that an immature person is someone who has given up
future wombs and rebirth into a new state of existence. They've cut them
off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that
they're unable to arise in the future. The Realized One has given up
future wombs and rebirth into a new state of existence. He has cut them
off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that
they're unable to arise in the future. In this sense you could rightly
say that I'm immature. But that's not what you're talking about.

Suppose, brahmin, there was a chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs.
And she properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated. Now, the
chick that is first to break out of the eggshell with its claws and beak
and hatch safely: should that be called the eldest or the youngest?"

"Mister Gotama, that should be called the eldest. For it is the eldest
among them."

"In the same way, in this population lost in ignorance, swaddled in
their shells, I alone have broken open the egg of ignorance and realized
the supreme perfect awakening. So, brahmin, I am the eldest and the
first in the world.

My energy was roused up and unflagging, my mindfulness was established
and lucid, my body was tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind was
immersed in samādhi. Quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first
absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while
placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind
and keeping it connected were stilled, I entered and remained in the
second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion,
with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and
keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, I entered and
remained in the third absorption, where I meditated with equanimity,
mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble
ones declare, 'Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.' With the
giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and
sadness, I entered and remained in the fourth absorption, without
pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.

When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this---purified,
bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and
imperturbable---I extended it toward recollection of past lives. I
recollected many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four,
five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a
hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons
of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and
expanding. I remembered: 'There, I was named this, my clan was that, I
looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and
pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place
I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was
that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt
pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away
from that place I was reborn here.' And so I recollected my many kinds
of past lives, with features and details.

This was the first knowledge, which I achieved in the first watch of the
night. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was
destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent,
keen, and resolute. This was my first breaking out, like a chick
breaking out of the eggshell.

When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this---purified,
bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and
imperturbable---I extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth
of sentient beings. With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I
saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn---inferior and
superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I
understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds:
'These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They
denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out
of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they're
reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear
beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They
never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to
act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death,
they're reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.' And so, with
clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings
passing away and being reborn---inferior and superior, beautiful and
ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings
are reborn according to their deeds.

This was the second knowledge, which I achieved in the middle watch of
the night. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was
destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent,
keen, and resolute. This was my second breaking out, like a chick
breaking out of the eggshell.

When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this---purified,
bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and
imperturbable---I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of
defilements. I truly understood: 'This is suffering' ... 'This is the
origin of suffering' ... 'This is the cessation of suffering' ... 'This
is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering'. I truly
understood: 'These are defilements' ... 'This is the origin of
defilements' ... 'This is the cessation of defilements' ... 'This is the
practice that leads to the cessation of defilements'. Knowing and seeing
like this, my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire
to be reborn, and ignorance. When it was freed, I knew it was freed.

I understood: 'Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been
completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further
for this place.'

This was the third knowledge, which I achieved in the last watch of the
night. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was
destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent,
keen, and resolute. This was my third breaking out, like a chick
breaking out of the eggshell."

When he said this, the brahmin Verañja said to the Buddha:

"Mister Gotama is the eldest! Mister Gotama is the best! Excellent,
Mister Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or
revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting
a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what's there,
Mister Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge
to Mister Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant
Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Mister Gotama remember me
as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."

### AN 8.12 With Sīha  *Sīhasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the
Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Now at that time several
very prominent Licchavis were sitting together at the town hall,
praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha in many
ways.

Now at that time General Sīha, a disciple of the Jains, was
sitting in that assembly. He thought, "That Blessed One must without a
doubt be a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha. For several very
prominent Licchavis are praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the
Saṅgha in many ways. Why don't I go to see that Blessed
One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!"

Then General Sīha went to the Jain ascetic of the
Ñātika clan and said to him, "Sir, I'd like to go to see
the ascetic Gotama."

"But Sīha, you believe in the doctrine of action. Why
should you go to see the ascetic Gotama, who teaches a doctrine of
inaction? For the ascetic Gotama believes in a doctrine of inaction, he
teaches inaction, and he guides his disciples in that way."

Then Sīha's determination to go and see the Buddha died
down.

For a second time, several prominent Licchavis were sitting together at
the town hall, praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the
Saṅgha in many ways. And for a second time
Sīha thought: "Why don't I go to see that Blessed One, the
perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!"

Then General Sīha went to the Jain Ñātika ...

Then for a second time Sīha's determination to go and see
the Buddha died down.

For a third time, several prominent Licchavis were sitting together at
the town hall, praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the
Saṅgha in many ways. And for a third time Sīha
thought, "That Blessed One must without a doubt be a perfected one, a
fully awakened Buddha. For several very prominent Licchavis are praising
the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways. What
can these Jains do to me, whether I take leave of them or not? Why don't
I, without taking leave of them, go to see that Blessed One, the
perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!"

Then Sīha, with around five hundred chariots, set out from
Vesālī in the middle of the day to see the Buddha. He went
by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and went by
foot. Then General Sīha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat
down to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, I have heard this: 'The ascetic Gotama believes in a doctrine of
inaction, he teaches inaction, and he guides his disciples in that way.'
I trust those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and do not
misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the
teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism?
For we don't want to misrepresent the Blessed One."

"There is, Sīha, a sense in which you could rightly say
that I believe in inaction, I teach inaction, and I guide my disciples
in that way.

And there is a sense in which you could rightly say that I believe in
action, I teach action, and I guide my disciples in that way.

And there is a sense in which you could rightly say that I believe in
annihilationism, I teach annihilation, and I guide my disciples in that
way.

And there is a sense in which you could rightly say that I'm disgusted,
I teach disgust, and I guide my disciples in that way.

And there is a sense in which you could rightly say that I'm an
exterminator, I teach extermination, and I guide my disciples in that
way.

And there is a sense in which you could rightly say that I'm a
mortifier, I teach mortification, and I guide my disciples in that way.

And there is a sense in which you could rightly say that I'm immature, I
teach immaturity, and I guide my disciples in that way.

And there is a sense in which you could rightly say that I'm ambitious,
I teach ambition, and I guide my disciples in that way.

And what's the sense in which you could rightly say that I believe in
inaction, I teach inaction, and I guide my disciples in that way? I
teach inaction regarding bad bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, and the
many kinds of unskillful things. In this sense you could rightly say
that I teach inaction.

And what's the sense in which you could rightly say that I believe in
action, I teach action, and I guide my disciples in that way? I teach
action regarding good bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, and the many
kinds of skillful things. In this sense you could rightly say that I
teach action.

And what's the sense in which you could rightly say that I believe in
annihilationism, I teach annihilation, and I guide my disciples in that
way? I teach the annihilation of greed, hate, and delusion, and the many
kinds of unskillful things. In this sense you could rightly say that I
teach annihilationism.

And what's the sense in which you could rightly say that I'm disgusted,
I teach disgust, and I guide my disciples in that way? I'm disgusted by
bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and by attainment of the
many kinds of unskillful things. In this sense you could rightly say
that I'm disgusted.

And what's the sense in which you could rightly say that I'm an
exterminator, I teach extermination, and I guide my disciples in that
way? I teach the extermination of greed, hate, and delusion, and the
many kinds of unskillful things. In this sense you could rightly say
that I'm an exterminator.

And what's the sense in which you could rightly say that I'm a
mortifier, I teach mortification, and I guide my disciples in that way?
I say that bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind should be
mortified. I say that a mortifier is someone who has given up unskillful
qualities that should be mortified. They've cut them off at the root,
made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they're unable to
arise in the future. The Realized One is someone who has given up
unskillful qualities that should be mortified. He has cut them off at
the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they're
unable to arise in the future. In this sense you could rightly say that
I'm a mortifier.

And what's the sense in which you could rightly say that I'm immature, I
teach immaturity, and I guide my disciples in that way? I say that an
immature person is someone who has given up future wombs and rebirth
into a new state of existence. They've cut them off at the root, made
them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they're unable to
arise in the future. The Realized One has given up future wombs and
rebirth into a new state of existence. He has cut them off at the root,
made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they're unable to
arise in the future. In this sense you could rightly say that I'm
immature.

And what's the sense in which you could rightly say that I'm ambitious,
I teach ambition, and I guide my disciples in that way? I'm ambitious to
offer solace, the highest solace, I teach solace, and I guide my
disciples in that way. In this sense you could rightly say that I'm
ambitious."

When he said this, General Sīha said to the Buddha,
"Excellent, sir! Excellent! From this day forth, may the Buddha remember
me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."

"Sīha, you should act after careful consideration. It's
good for well-known people such as yourself to act after careful
consideration."

"Now I'm even more delighted and satisfied with the Buddha, since he
tells me to act after careful consideration. For if the followers of
other religions were to gain me as a disciple, they'd carry a banner all
over Vesālī, saying: 'General Sīha has become
our disciple!' And yet the Buddha tells me to act after careful
consideration. For a second time, I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the
teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth,
may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for
life."

"For a long time now, Sīha, your family has been a
well-spring of support for the Jain ascetics. You should consider giving
to them when they come."

"Now I'm even more delighted and satisfied with the Buddha, since he
tells me to consider giving to the Jain ascetics when they come. Sir, I
have heard that the ascetic Gotama says this: 'Gifts should only be
given to me, and to my disciples. Only what is given to me is very
fruitful, not what is given to others. Only what is given to my
disciples is very fruitful, not what is given to the disciples of
others.' Yet the Buddha encourages me to give to the Jain ascetics.
Well, sir, we'll know the proper time for that. For a third time, I go
for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant
Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as
a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."

Then the Buddha taught Sīha step by step, with a talk on
giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of
sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of
renunciation. And when the Buddha knew that Sīha's mind was
ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained
the special teaching of the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its
cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would
properly absorb dye, in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision
of the Dhamma arose in General Sīha: "Everything that has a
beginning has an end."

Then Sīha saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the
Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became
self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher's
instructions. He said to the Buddha, "Sir, may the Buddha together with
the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow's meal from
me." The Buddha consented with silence. Then, knowing that the Buddha
had consented, Sīha got up from his seat, bowed, and
respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before
leaving.

Then Sīha addressed a certain man, "Mister, please find out
if there is any meat ready for sale." And when the night had passed
General Sīha had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared
in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,
"Sir, it's time. The meal is ready."

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
went to Sīha's home, where he sat on the seat spread out,
together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Now at that time
many Jain ascetics in Vesālī went from street to street and
from square to square, calling out with raised arms: "Today General
Sīha has slaughtered a fat calf for the ascetic Gotama's
meal. The ascetic Gotama knowingly eats meat prepared specially for him:
this is a deed he caused."

Then a certain person went up to Sīha and whispered in his
ear, "Please sir, you should know this. Many Jain ascetics in
Vesālī are going from street to street and square to
square, calling out with raised arms: 'Today General Sīha
has slaughtered a fat calf for the ascetic Gotama's meal. The ascetic
Gotama knowingly eats meat prepared specially for him: this is a deed he
caused.'"

"Enough, master. For a long time those venerables have wanted to
discredit the Buddha, his teaching, and his Saṅgha. They'll
never stop misrepresenting the Buddha with their incorrect, hollow,
false, untruthful claims. We would never deliberately take the life of a
living creature, not even for life's sake."

Then Sīha served and satisfied the mendicant
Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with
delicious fresh and cooked foods. When the Buddha had eaten and washed
his hand and bowl, Sīha sat down to one side. Then the
Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma
talk, after which he got up from his seat and left.

### AN 8.13 A Thoroughbred  *Assājānīyasutta*

"Mendicants, a fine royal thoroughbred with eight factors is worthy of a
king, fit to serve a king, and considered a factor of kingship. What
eight?

It's when a fine royal thoroughbred is well born on both the mother's
and the father's sides.

He's bred in the region fine thoroughbreds come from.

Whatever food he's given, fresh or dry, he eats carefully, without
making a mess.

He's disgusted by sitting or lying down in excrement or urine.

He's sweet-natured and pleasant to live with, and he doesn't upset the
other horses.

He openly shows his tricks, bluffs, ruses, and feints to his trainer, so
the trainer can try to subdue them.

He carries his load, determining: 'Whether or not the other horses carry
their loads, I'll carry mine.'

He always walks in a straight path. He's strong, and stays strong even
until death.

A fine royal thoroughbred with these eight factors is worthy of a king.
...

In the same way, a mendicant with eight qualities is worthy of offerings
dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious
donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field
of merit for the world. What eight?

It's when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code,
conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places.
Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they've
undertaken.

Whatever food they're given, coarse or fine, they eat carefully, without
bother.

They're disgusted with bad conduct by way of body, speech, or mind, and
by attainment of the many kinds of unskillful things.

They're sweet-natured and pleasant to live with, and they don't upset
the other mendicants.

They openly show their tricks, bluffs, ruses, and feints to their
sensible spiritual companions, so they can try to subdue them.

They do their training, determining: 'Whether or not the other
mendicants do their training, I'll do mine.'

They always walk in a straight path. And here the straight path is right
view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right
effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.

They're energetic: 'Gladly, let my skin, sinews, and bones remain! Let
the blood and flesh waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until
I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.'

A mendicant with these eight qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated
to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation,
worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of
merit for the world."

### AN 8.14 A Wild Colt  *Assakhaḷuṅkasutta*

"Mendicants, I will teach you about eight wild colts and eight defects
in horses, and about eight wild people and eight defects in people.
Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"And what, mendicants, are the eight wild colts and eight defects in
horses?

Firstly, when the trainer says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them on,
some wild colts back right up and spin the chariot behind them. Some
wild colts are like that. This is the first defect of a horse.

Furthermore, when the trainer says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them
on, some wild colts jump back, wreck the hub, and break the triple rod.
Some wild colts are like that. This is the second defect of a horse.

Furthermore, when the trainer says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them
on, some wild colts shake the cart-pole off their thigh and trample it.
Some wild colts are like that. This is the third defect of a horse.

Furthermore, when the trainer says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them
on, some wild colts take a wrong turn, sending the chariot off track.
Some wild colts are like that. This is the fourth defect of a horse.

Furthermore, when the trainer says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them
on, some wild colts rear up and strike out with their fore-legs. Some
wild colts are like that. This is the fifth defect of a horse.

Furthermore, when the trainer says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them
on, some wild colts ignore the trainer and the goad, spit out the bit,
and go wherever they want. Some wild colts are like that. This is the
sixth defect of a horse.

Furthermore, when the trainer says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them
on, some wild colts don't step forward or turn back but stand right
there still as a post. Some wild colts are like that. This is the
seventh defect of a horse.

Furthermore, when the trainer says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them
on, some wild colts tuck in their fore-legs and hind-legs, and sit right
down on their four legs. Some wild colts are like that. This is the
eighth defect of a horse. These are the eight wild colts and the eight
defects in horses.

And what are the eight wild people and eight defects in people?

Firstly, the mendicants accuse a mendicant of an offense. But the
accused mendicant evades it by saying they don't remember. I say that
this person is comparable to the wild colts who, when the trainer says
'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them on, back right up and spin the
chariot behind them. Some wild people are like that. This is the first
defect of a person.

Furthermore, the mendicants accuse a mendicant of an offense. But the
accused mendicant objects to the accuser: 'What has an incompetent fool
like you got to say? How on earth could you imagine you've got something
worth saying!' I say that this person is comparable to the wild colts
who, when the trainer says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them on, jump
back, wreck the hub, and break the triple rod. Some wild people are like
that. This is the second defect of a person.

Furthermore, the mendicants accuse a mendicant of an offense. But the
accused mendicant retorts to the accuser: 'Well, you've fallen into
such-and-such an offense. You should deal with that first.' I say that
this person is comparable to the wild colts who, when the trainer says
'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them on, shake the cart-pole off their
thigh and trample it. Some wild people are like that. This is the third
defect of a person.

Furthermore, the mendicants accuse a mendicant of an offense. But the
accused mendicant dodges the issue, distracts the discussion with
irrelevant points, and displays annoyance, hate, and bitterness. I say
that this person is comparable to the wild colts who, when the trainer
says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them on, take a wrong turn, sending
the chariot off track. Some wild people are like that. This is the
fourth defect of a person.

Furthermore, the mendicants accuse a mendicant of an offense. But the
accused mendicant gesticulates while speaking in the middle of the
Saṅgha. I say that this person is comparable to the wild
colts who, when the trainer says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them on,
rear up and strike out with their fore-legs. Some wild people are like
that. This is the fifth defect of a person.

Furthermore, the mendicants accuse a mendicant of an offense. But the
accused mendicant ignores the Saṅgha and the accusation
and, though still guilty of the offense, they go wherever they want. I
say that this person is comparable to the wild colts who, when the
trainer says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them on, ignore the trainer
and the goad, spit out the bit, and go wherever they want. Some wild
people are like that. This is the sixth defect of a person.

Furthermore, the mendicants accuse a mendicant of an offense. But the
accused mendicant neither confesses to the offense nor denies it, but
frustrates the Saṅgha by staying silent. I say that this
person is comparable to the wild colts who, when the trainer says
'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them on, don't step forward or turn back
but stand right there still as a post. Some wild people are like that.
This is the seventh defect of a person.

Furthermore, the mendicants accuse a mendicant of an offense. But the
accused mendicant says this: 'Why are you venerables making so much of
an issue over me? Now I'll resign the training and return to a lesser
life.' When they have resigned the training, they say: 'Well,
venerables, are you happy now?' I say that this person is comparable to
the wild colts who, when the trainer says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads
them on, tuck in their fore-legs and hind-legs, and sit right down on
their four legs. Some wild people are like that. This is the eighth
defect of a person.

These are the eight wild people and eight defects in people."

### AN 8.15 Stains  *Malasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these eight stains. What eight? Not reciting is
the stain of hymns. Neglect is the stain of houses. Laziness is the
stain of beauty. Negligence is a guard's stain. Misconduct is a woman's
stain. Stinginess is a giver's stain. Bad, unskillful qualities are a
stain in this world and the next. Worse than any of these is ignorance,
the worst stain of all. These are the eight stains.

> Not reciting is the stain of hymns.\
> The stain of houses is neglect.\
> Laziness is the stain of beauty.\
> A guard's stain is negligence.
>
> Misconduct is a woman's stain.\
> A giver's stain is stinginess.\
> Bad qualities are a stain\
> in this world and the next.\
> But a worse stain than these\

### AN 8.16 Going on a Mission  *Dūteyyasutta*

"Mendicants, a mendicant with eight qualities is worthy of going on a
mission. What eight? It's a mendicant who learns and educates others.
They memorize and remember. They understand and help others understand.
They're skilled at knowing what's on topic and what isn't. And they
don't cause quarrels. A mendicant with these eight qualities is worthy
of going on a mission.

Having eight qualities Sāriputta is worthy of going on a
mission. What eight? He learns and educates others. He memorizes and
remembers. He understands and helps others understand. He's skilled at
knowing what's on topic and what isn't. And he doesn't cause quarrels.
Having these eight qualities Sāriputta is worthy of going
on a mission.

> They don't tremble when arriving\
> at an assembly of fierce debaters.\
> They don't miss out any words,\
> or conceal the instructions.
>
> Their words aren't poisoned,\
> and they don't tremble when questioned.\
> Such a mendicant\
> is worthy of going on a mission."

### AN 8.17 Catching (1st)  *Paṭhamabandhanasutta*

"Mendicants, a woman catches a man using eight features. What eight?
With weeping, laughing, speaking, appearance, gifts of wildflowers,
scents, tastes, and touches. A woman catches a man using these eight
features. But those beings who are caught by touch are well and truly
caught."

<!--pg-->
### AN 8.18 Catching (2nd)  *Dutiyabandhanasutta*

"Mendicants, a man catches a woman using eight features. What eight?

scents, tastes, and touches. A man catches a woman using these eight
features. But those beings who are caught by touch are well and truly

### AN 8.19 With Pahārāda  *Pahārādasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in Verañjā at the root
of a neem tree dedicated to Naḷeru.

Then Pahārāda, lord of titans, went up to the Buddha,
bowed, and stood to one side. The Buddha said to him, "Well,
Pahārāda, do the titans love the ocean?"

"Sir, they do indeed."

"But seeing what incredible and amazing things do the titans love the
ocean?"

"Sir, seeing eight incredible and amazing things the titans love the
ocean. What eight? The ocean gradually slants, slopes, and inclines,
with no abrupt precipice. This is the first thing the titans love about
the ocean.

Furthermore, the ocean is consistent and doesn't overflow its
boundaries. This is the second thing the titans love about the ocean.

Furthermore, the ocean doesn't accommodate a carcass, but quickly
carries it to the shore and strands it on the beach. This is the third
thing the titans love about the ocean.

Furthermore, when they reach the ocean, all the great rivers---that is,
the Ganges, Yamunā, Aciravatī,
Sarabhū, and Mahī---lose their names and clans
and are simply considered 'the ocean'. This is the fourth thing the
titans love about the ocean.

Furthermore, for all the world's streams that reach it, and the showers
that fall from the sky, the ocean never empties or fills up. This is the
fifth thing the titans love about the ocean.

Furthermore, the ocean has just one taste, the taste of salt. This is
the sixth thing the titans love about the ocean.

Furthermore, the ocean is full of many kinds of treasures, such as
pearls, gems, beryl, conch, quartz, coral, silver, native gold, rubies,
and emeralds. This is the seventh thing the titans love about the ocean.

Furthermore, many great beings live in the ocean, such as leviathans,
leviathan-gulpers, leviathan-gulper-gulpers, titans, dragons, and
centaurs. In the ocean there are life-forms a hundred leagues long, or
even two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, or five hundred leagues
long. This is the eighth thing the titans love about the ocean.

Seeing these eight incredible and amazing things the titans love the
ocean.

Well, sir, do the mendicants love this teaching and training?"

"They do indeed, Pahārāda."

"But seeing how many incredible and amazing things do the mendicants
love this teaching and training?"

"Seeing eight incredible and amazing things, Pahārāda, the
mendicants love this teaching and training. What eight?

The ocean gradually slants, slopes, and inclines, with no abrupt
precipice. In the same way in this teaching and training the penetration
to enlightenment comes from gradual training, progress, and practice,
not abruptly. This is the first thing the mendicants love about this
teaching and training.

The ocean is consistent and doesn't overflow its boundaries. In the same
way, when a training rule is laid down for my disciples they wouldn't
break it even for the sake of their own life. This is the second thing
the mendicants love about this teaching and training.

The ocean doesn't accommodate a carcass, but quickly carries it to the
shore and strands it on the beach. In the same way, the
Saṅgha doesn't accommodate a person who is unethical, of
bad qualities, filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true
ascetic or spiritual practitioner---though claiming to be one---rotten
inside, festering, and depraved. But they quickly gather and expel them.
Even if such a person is sitting in the middle of the
Saṅgha, they're far from the Saṅgha, and the
Saṅgha is far from them. This is the third thing the
mendicants love about this teaching and training.

When they reach the ocean, all the great rivers---that is, the Ganges,
Yamunā, Aciravatī, Sarabhū, and
Mahī---lose their names and clans and are simply considered
'the ocean'. In the same way, when they go forth from the lay life to
homelessness, all four classes---aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and
menials---lose their former names and clans and are simply considered
'ascetics who follow the Sakyan'. This is the fourth thing the
mendicants love about this teaching and training.

For all the world's streams that reach it, and the showers that fall
from the sky, the ocean never empties or fills up. In the same way,
though several mendicants become fully extinguished in the element of
extinguishment with no residue, the element of extinguishment never
empties or fills up. This is the fifth thing the mendicants love about
this teaching and training.

The ocean has just one taste, the taste of salt. In the same way, this
teaching and training has one taste, the taste of freedom. This is the
sixth thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training.

The ocean is full of many kinds of treasures, such as pearls, gems,
beryl, conch, quartz, coral, silver, native gold, rubies, and emeralds.
In the same way, this teaching and training is full of many kinds of
treasures, such as the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four
right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the
five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path.
This is the seventh thing the mendicants love about this teaching and
training.

Many great beings live in the ocean, such as leviathans,
leviathan-gulpers, leviathan-gulper-gulpers, titans, dragons, and
centaurs. In the ocean there are life-forms a hundred leagues long, or
even two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, or five hundred leagues
long. In the same way, great beings live in this teaching and training,
and these are those beings. The stream-enterer and the one practicing to
realize the fruit of stream-entry. The once-returner and the one
practicing to realize the fruit of once-return. The non-returner and the
one practicing to realize the fruit of non-return. The perfected one,
and the one practicing for perfection. This is the eighth thing the
mendicants love about this teaching and training.

Seeing these eight incredible and amazing things, Pahārāda,
the mendicants love this teaching and training."

### AN 8.20 Sabbath  *Uposathasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the
stilt longhouse of Migāra's mother in the Eastern
Monastery.

Now, at that time it was the sabbath, and the Buddha was sitting
surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks. And then, as the night
was getting late, in the first watch of the night, Venerable Ānanda got
up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined
palms toward the Buddha and said, "Sir, the night is getting late. It is
the first watch of the night, and the Saṅgha of monks has
been sitting long. Please, sir, may the Buddha recite the monastic code
to the monks."

But when he said this, the Buddha kept silent.

For a second time, as the night was getting late, in the middle watch of
the night, Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one
shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said, "Sir, the
night is getting late. It is the middle watch of the night, and the
Saṅgha of monks has been sitting long. Please, sir, may the
Buddha recite the monastic code to the monks."

But for a second time the Buddha kept silent.

For a third time, as the night was getting late, in the last watch of
the night, as dawn stirred, bringing joy to the night, Ānanda got up
from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined
palms toward the Buddha and said, "Sir, the night is getting late. It is
the last watch of the night and dawn stirs, bringing joy to the night.
And the Saṅgha has been sitting long. Please, sir, may the
Buddha recite the monastic code to the monks."

"Ānanda, the assembly is not pure."

Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna thought, "Who is the Buddha
talking about?"

Then he focused on comprehending the minds of everyone in the
Saṅgha. He saw that unethical person, of bad qualities,
filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true ascetic or
spiritual practitioner---though claiming to be one---rotten inside,
festering, and depraved, sitting in the middle of the
Saṅgha.

When he saw him he got up from his seat, went up to him and said, "Get
up, reverend. The Buddha has seen you. You can't live in communion with
the monks."

But when he said this, that person kept silent.

For a second time

and a third time, he asked that monk to leave.

But for a third time that person kept silent.

Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna took that person by the arm,
ejected him out the gate, and bolted the door. Then he went up to the
Buddha, and said to him, "I have ejected that person. The assembly is
pure. Please, sir, may the Buddha recite the monastic code to the
monks."

"It's incredible, Moggallāna, it's amazing, how that futile
man waited to be taken by the arm!"

Then the Buddha said to the monks:

"Now, monks, you should perform the sabbath and recite the monastic
code. From this day forth, I will not perform the sabbath or recite the
monastic code. It's impossible, monks, it can't happen that a Realized
One could recite the monastic code in an impure assembly.

Seeing these eight incredible and amazing things the titans love the
ocean. What eight? The ocean gradually slants, slopes, and inclines,
with no abrupt precipice. This is the first thing the titans love about
the ocean.

## The Chapter on Householders

### AN 8.21 With Ugga of Vesālī  *Paṭhamauggasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the
Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. There the Buddha addressed
the mendicants: "Mendicants, you should remember the householder Ugga of
Vesālī as someone who has eight amazing and incredible
qualities."

That is what the Buddha said. When he had spoken, the Holy One got up
from his seat and entered his dwelling.

Then a certain mendicant robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl
and robe, went to the home of the householder Ugga of
Vesālī, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then Ugga of
Vesālī went up to that mendicant, bowed, and sat down to
one side. The mendicant said to him:

"Householder, the Buddha declared that you have eight amazing and
incredible qualities. What are the eight qualities that he spoke of?"

"Sir, I don't know what eight amazing and incredible qualities the
Buddha was referring to. But these eight amazing and incredible
qualities are found in me. Listen and apply your mind well, I will
speak."

"Yes, householder," replied the mendicant. Ugga of Vesālī
said this:

"Sir, when I first saw the Buddha off in the distance, my heart was
inspired as soon as I saw him. This is the first incredible and amazing
quality found in me.

With confident heart I paid homage to the Buddha. The Buddha taught me
step by step, with a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He
explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and
the benefit of renunciation. And when he knew that my mind was ready,
pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the
special teaching of the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation,
and the path. Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb
dye, in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma
arose in me: 'Everything that has a beginning has an end.' I saw,
attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. I went beyond doubt, got
rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others
regarding the Teacher's instructions. Right there I went for refuge to
the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha. And I undertook
the five training rules with celibacy as the fifth. This is the second
incredible and amazing quality found in me.

I had four teenage wives. And I went to them and said: 'Sisters, I've
undertaken the five training rules with celibacy as fifth. If you wish,
you may stay here, enjoy my wealth, and do good deeds. Or you can return
to your own families. Or would you prefer if I gave you to another man?'
When I said this, my eldest wife said to me: 'Master, please give me to
such-and-such a man.' Then I summoned that man. Taking my wife with my
left hand and a ceremonial vase with my right, I presented her to that
man with the pouring of water. But I can't recall getting upset while
giving away my teenage wife. This is the third incredible and amazing
quality found in me.

And though my family has wealth, it's shared without reserve with
ethical people of good character. This is the fourth incredible and
amazing quality found in me.

When I pay homage to a mendicant, I do so carefully, not carelessly.
This is the fifth incredible and amazing quality found in me.

If that venerable teaches me the Dhamma, I listen carefully, not
carelessly. But if they don't teach me the Dhamma, I teach them. This is
the sixth incredible and amazing quality found in me.

It's not unusual for deities to come to me and announce: 'Householder,
the Buddha's teaching is well explained!' When they say this I say to
them: 'The Buddha's teaching is well explained, regardless of whether or
not you deities say so!' But I don't recall getting too excited by the
fact that the deities come to me, and I have a conversation with them.
This is the seventh incredible and amazing quality found in me.

Of the five lower fetters taught by the Buddha, I don't see any that I
haven't given up. This is the eighth incredible and amazing quality
found in me.

These eight amazing and incredible qualities are found in me. But I
don't know what eight amazing and incredible qualities the Buddha was
referring to."

Then that mendicant, after taking almsfood in Ugga of
Vesālī's home, got up from his seat and left. Then after
the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed,
and sat down to one side. He informed the Buddha of all he had discussed
with the householder Ugga of Vesālī. The Buddha said:

"Good, good, mendicant! When I declared that the householder Ugga of
Vesālī was someone who has eight amazing and incredible
qualities, I was referring to the same eight qualities that he rightly
explained to you. You should remember the householder Ugga of
Vesālī as someone who has these eight amazing and
incredible qualities."

### AN 8.22 With Ugga of Elephant Village  *Dutiyauggasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Vajjis at Elephant
Village. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: "Mendicants, you
should remember the householder Ugga of Elephant Village as someone who
has eight amazing and incredible qualities."

That is what the Buddha said. When he had spoken, the Holy One got up
from his seat and entered his dwelling.

Then a certain mendicant robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl
and robe, went to the home of the householder Ugga of Elephant Village,
where he sat on the seat spread out. Then Ugga of Elephant Village went
up to that mendicant, bowed, and sat down to one side. The mendicant
said to him:

"Householder, the Buddha declared that you have eight amazing and
incredible qualities. What are the eight qualities that he spoke of?"

"Sir, I don't know what eight amazing and incredible qualities the
Buddha was referring to. But these eight amazing and incredible
qualities are found in me. Listen and apply your mind well, I will
speak."

"Yes, householder," replied the mendicant. Ugga of Elephant Village said
this:

"Sir, when I first saw the Buddha off in the distance I was partying in
the Dragon's Park. My heart was inspired as soon as I saw him, and I
sobered up. This is the first incredible and amazing quality found in
me.

With confident heart I paid homage to the Buddha. The Buddha taught me
step by step, with a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He
explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and
the benefit of renunciation. And when he knew that my mind was ready,
pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the

And though my family has wealth, it's shared without reserve with
ethical people of good character. This is the fourth incredible and
amazing quality found in me.

When I pay homage to a mendicant, I do so carefully, not carelessly. If
that venerable teaches me the Dhamma, I listen carefully, not
carelessly. But if they don't teach me the Dhamma, I teach them. This is
the fifth incredible and amazing quality found in me.

It's not unusual for deities to come to me when the Saṅgha
has been invited and announce: 'Householder, that mendicant is freed
both ways. That one is freed by wisdom. That one is a direct witness.
That one is attained to view. That one is freed by faith. That one is a
follower of teachings. That one is a follower by faith. That one is
ethical, of good character. That one is unethical, of bad character.'
But while I'm serving the Saṅgha I don't recall thinking:
'Let me give this one just a little, and that one a lot.' Rather, I give
impartially. This is the sixth incredible and amazing quality found in
me.

It's not unusual for deities to come to me and announce: 'Householder,
the Buddha's teaching is well explained!' When they say this I say to
them: 'The Buddha's teaching is well explained, regardless of whether or
not you deities say so!' But I don't recall getting too excited by the
fact that the deities come to me, and I have a conversation with them.
This is the seventh incredible and amazing quality found in me.

If I pass away before the Buddha, it would be no wonder if the Buddha
declares of me: 'The householder Ugga of Elephant Village is bound by no
fetter that might return him to this world.' This is the eighth
incredible and amazing quality found in me.

These eight amazing and incredible qualities are found in me. But I
don't know what eight amazing and incredible qualities the Buddha was
referring to."

Then that mendicant, after taking almsfood in Ugga of Elephant Village's
home, got up from his seat and left. Then after the meal, on his return
from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
He informed the Buddha of all he had discussed with the householder Ugga

### AN 8.23 With Hatthaka (1st)  *Paṭhamahatthakasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Āḷavī, at the
Aggāḷava Tree-shrine. There the Buddha addressed the
mendicants:

"Mendicants, you should remember the householder Hatthaka of
Āḷavī as someone who has seven amazing and incredible
qualities. What seven? He's faithful, ethical, conscientious, prudent,
learned, generous, and wise. You should remember the householder
Hatthaka of Āḷavī as someone who has these seven amazing
and incredible qualities."

That is what the Buddha said. When he had spoken, the Holy One got up
from his seat and entered his dwelling.

Then a certain mendicant robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl
and robe, went to the home of the householder Hatthaka of
Āḷavī, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then Hatthaka
went up to that mendicant, bowed, and sat down to one side. The
mendicant said to Hatthaka:

"Householder, the Buddha declared that you have seven amazing and
incredible qualities. What seven? He said that you're faithful, ethical,
conscientious, prudent, learned, generous, and wise. The Buddha declared
that you have these seven amazing and incredible qualities."

"But sir, I trust that no white-clothed lay people were present?"

"No, there weren't any white-clothed lay people present."

"That's good, sir."

Then that mendicant, after taking almsfood in Hatthaka of
Āḷavī's home, got up from his seat and left. Then after the
meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat
down to one side, and told him of what he had discussed with the
householder Hatthaka. The Buddha said:

"Good, good, mendicant! That gentleman has few wishes. He doesn't want
his own good qualities to be made known to others. Well then, mendicant,
you should remember the householder Hatthaka of Āḷavī as
someone who has this eighth amazing and incredible quality, that is,
fewness of wishes."

### AN 8.24 With Hatthaka (2nd)  *Dutiyahatthakasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Āḷavī, at the
Aggāḷava Tree-shrine. Then the householder Hatthaka of
Āḷavī, escorted by around five hundred lay followers, went
up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to
Hatthaka:

"Hatthaka, you have a large congregation. How do you bring together such
a large congregation?"

"Sir, I bring together such a large congregation by using the four ways
of being inclusive as taught by the Buddha. When I know that a person
can be included by a gift, I include them by giving a gift. When I know
that a person can be included by kindly words, I include them by kindly
words. When I know that a person can be included by taking care of them,
I include them by caring for them. When I know that a person can be
included by equality, I include them by treating them equally. But also,
sir, my family is wealthy. They wouldn't think that a poor person was
worth listening to in the same way."

"Good, good, Hatthaka! This is the right way to bring together a large
congregation. Whether in the past, future, or present, all those who
have brought together a large congregation have done so by using these
four ways of being inclusive."

Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Hatthaka of
Āḷavī with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his
seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha before leaving. Then,
not long after Hatthaka had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
"Mendicants, you should remember the householder Hatthaka of
Āḷavī as someone who has eight amazing and incredible
qualities. What eight? He's faithful, ethical, conscientious, prudent,
learned, generous, wise, and has few wishes. You should remember the
householder Hatthaka of Āḷavī as someone who has these
eight amazing and incredible qualities."

### AN 8.25 With Mahānāma  *Mahānāmasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near
Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. Then Mahānāma
the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said
to him:

"Sir, how is a lay follower defined?"

"Mahānāma, when you've gone for refuge to the Buddha, the
teaching, and the Saṅgha, you're considered to be a lay
follower."

"But how is an ethical lay follower defined?"

"When a lay follower doesn't kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual
misconduct, lie, or consume beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants, they're
considered to be an ethical lay follower."

"But how do we define a lay follower who is practicing to benefit
themselves, not others?"

"A lay follower is accomplished in faith, but doesn't encourage others
to do the same. They're accomplished in ethical conduct, but don't
encourage others to do the same. They're accomplished in generosity, but
don't encourage others to do the same. They like to see the mendicants,
but don't encourage others to do the same. They like to hear the true
teaching, but don't encourage others to do the same. They readily
memorize the teachings they've heard, but don't encourage others to do
the same. They examine the meaning of the teachings they've memorized,
but don't encourage others to do the same. Understanding the meaning and
the teaching, they practice accordingly, but they don't encourage others
to do the same. That's how we define a lay follower who is practicing to
benefit themselves, not others."

"But how do we define a lay follower who is practicing to benefit both
themselves and others?"

"A lay follower is accomplished in faith and encourages others to do the
same. They're accomplished in ethical conduct and encourage others to do
the same. They're accomplished in generosity and encourage others to do
the same. They like to see the mendicants and encourage others to do the
same. They like to hear the true teaching and encourage others to do the
same. They readily memorize the teachings they've heard and encourage
others to do the same. They examine the meaning of the teachings they've
memorized and encourage others to do the same. Understanding the meaning
and the teaching, they practice accordingly and they encourage others to
do the same. That's how we define a lay follower who is practicing to
benefit both themselves and others."

### AN 8.26 With Jīvaka  *Jīvakasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in
Jīvaka's Mango Grove. Then Jīvaka
Komārabhacca went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to him, "Sir, how is a lay follower defined?"

"Jīvaka, when you've gone for refuge to the Buddha, the
teaching, and the Saṅgha, you're considered to be a lay
follower."

"But how is an ethical lay follower defined?"

"When a lay follower doesn't kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual
misconduct, lie, or consume beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants, they're
considered to be an ethical lay follower."

"But how do we define a lay follower who is practicing to benefit
themselves, not others?"

"A lay follower is accomplished in faith, but doesn't encourage others
to do the same. They're accomplished in ethical conduct ... they're
accomplished in generosity ... they like to see the mendicants ... they
like to hear the true teaching ... they memorize the teachings ... they
examine the meaning ... Understanding the meaning and the teaching, they
practice accordingly, but they don't encourage others to do the same.
That's how we define a lay follower who is practicing to benefit
themselves, not others."

"But how do we define a lay follower who is practicing to benefit both
themselves and others?"

"A lay follower is accomplished in faith and encourages others to do the
same. They're accomplished in ethical conduct and encourage others to do
the same. They're accomplished in generosity and encourage others to do
the same. They like to see the mendicants and encourage others to do the
same. They like to hear the true teaching and encourage others to do the
same. They readily memorize the teachings they've heard and encourage
others to do the same. They examine the meaning of the teachings they've
memorized and encourage others to do the same. Understanding the meaning
and the teaching, they practice accordingly and they encourage others to
do the same. That's how we define a lay follower who is practicing to
benefit both themselves and others."

<!--pg-->
### AN 8.27 Powers (1st)  *Paṭhamabalasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these eight powers. What eight? Crying is the
power of babies. Anger is the power of females. Weapons are the power of
bandits. Authority is the power of rulers. Complaining is the power of
fools. Reason is the power of the astute. Reflection is the power of the
learned. Patience is the power of ascetics and brahmins. These are the
eight powers."

<!--pg-->
### AN 8.28 Powers (2nd)  *Dutiyabalasutta*

Then Venerable Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, and
sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:

"Sāriputta, how many powers does a mendicant who has ended
the defilements have that qualify them to claim: 'My defilements have
ended'?"

"Sir, a mendicant who has ended the defilements has eight powers that
qualify them to claim: 'My defilements have ended.'

What eight? Firstly, a mendicant with defilements ended has clearly seen
with right wisdom all conditions as truly impermanent. This is a power
that a mendicant who has ended the defilements relies on to claim: 'My
defilements have ended.'

Furthermore, a mendicant with defilements ended has clearly seen with
right wisdom that sensual pleasures are truly like a pit of glowing
coals. This is a power that a mendicant who has ended the defilements
relies on to claim: 'My defilements have ended.'

Furthermore, the mind of a mendicant with defilements ended slants,
slopes, and inclines to seclusion. They're withdrawn, loving
renunciation, and have totally eliminated defiling influences. This is a
power that a mendicant who has ended the defilements relies on to claim:
'My defilements have ended.'

Furthermore, a mendicant with defilements ended has well developed the
four kinds of mindfulness meditation. This is a power that a mendicant
who has ended the defilements relies on to claim: 'My defilements have
ended.'

Furthermore, a mendicant with defilements ended has well developed the
four bases of psychic power ... the five faculties ... the seven
awakening factors ... the noble eightfold path. This is a power that a
mendicant who has ended the defilements relies on to claim: 'My
defilements have ended.'

A mendicant who has ended the defilements has these eight powers that
qualify them to claim: 'My defilements have ended.'"

<!--pg-->
### AN 8.29 Lost Opportunities  *Akkhaṇasutta*

"'Now is the time! Now is the time!' So says an unlearned ordinary
person. But they don't know whether it's time or not. Mendicants, there
are eight lost opportunities for spiritual practice. What eight?

Firstly, a Realized One has arisen in the world---perfected, a fully
awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of
the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods
and humans, awakened, blessed. He teaches the Dhamma leading to peace,
extinguishment, awakening, as proclaimed by the Holy One. But a person
has been reborn in hell. This is the first lost opportunity for
spiritual practice.

Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world. But a person has
been reborn in the animal realm. This is the second lost opportunity.

Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world. But a person has
been reborn in the ghost realm. This is the third lost opportunity.

Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world. But a person has
been reborn in one of the long-lived orders of gods. This is the fourth
lost opportunity.

Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world. But a person has
been reborn in the borderlands, among uneducated foreigners, where
monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen do not go. This is the fifth lost
opportunity ...

Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world. And a person is
reborn in a central country. But they have wrong view and distorted
perspective: 'There's no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings.
There's no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There's no afterlife.
There's no such thing as mother and father, or beings that are reborn
spontaneously. And there's no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly
comported and rightly practiced, and who describes the afterlife after
realizing it with their own insight.' This is the sixth lost opportunity
...

Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world. And a person is
reborn in a central country. But they're witless, dull, idiotic, and
unable to distinguish what is well said from what is poorly said. This
is the seventh lost opportunity ...

Furthermore, a Realized One has not arisen in the world ... So he
doesn't teach the Dhamma leading to peace, extinguishment, awakening, as
proclaimed by the Holy One. And a person is reborn in a central country.
And they're wise, bright, clever, and able to distinguish what is well
said from what is poorly said. This is the eighth lost opportunity ...

There are these eight lost opportunities for spiritual practice.

Mendicants, there is just one opportunity for spiritual practice. What
is that one? It's when a Realized One has arisen in the world,
perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and
conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to
train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. He teaches the
Dhamma leading to peace, extinguishment, awakening, as proclaimed by the
Holy One. And a person is reborn in a central country. And they're wise,
bright, clever, and able to distinguish what is well said from what is
poorly said. This is the one opportunity for spiritual practice.

### AN 8.30 Anuruddha and the Great Thoughts  *Anuruddhamahāvitakkasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas at
Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā's Wood. And
at that time Venerable Anuruddha was staying in the land of the
Cetīs in the Eastern Bamboo Park. Then as Anuruddha was in
private retreat this thought came to his mind:

"This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of many wishes.
It's for the contented, not those who lack contentment. It's for the
secluded, not those who enjoy company. It's for the energetic, not the
lazy. It's for the mindful, not the unmindful. It's for those with
immersion, not those without immersion. It's for the wise, not the
witless."

Then the Buddha knew what Anuruddha was thinking. As easily as a strong
person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the deer
park at Bhesakaḷā's Wood in the land of the Bhaggas and
reappeared in front of Anuruddha in the Eastern Bamboo Park in the land
of the Cetīs, and sat on the seat spread out. Anuruddha
bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:

"Good, good, Anuruddha! It's good that you reflect on these thoughts of
a great man: 'This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of
many wishes. It's for the contented, not those who lack contentment.
It's for the secluded, not those who enjoy company. It's for the
energetic, not the lazy. It's for the mindful, not the unmindful. It's
for those with immersion, not those without immersion. It's for the
wise, not the witless.' Well then, Anuruddha, you should also reflect on
the following eighth thought of a great man: 'This teaching is for those
who don't enjoy proliferating and don't like to proliferate, not for
those who enjoy proliferating and like to proliferate.'

First you'll reflect on these eight thoughts of a great man. Then
whenever you want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unskillful qualities, you'll enter and remain in the first absorption,
which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the
mind and keeping it connected.

You'll enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture
and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one,
without placing the mind and keeping it connected.

You'll enter and remain in the third absorption, where you'll meditate
with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of
which the noble ones declare, 'Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in
bliss.'

Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness,
you'll enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or
pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.

First you'll reflect on these eight thoughts of a great man, and you'll
get the four absorptions---blissful meditations in this life that belong
to the higher mind---when you want, without trouble or difficulty. Then
as you live contented your rag robe will seem to you like a chest full
of garments of different colors seems to a householder or householder's
child. It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for
alighting upon extinguishment.

As you live contented your scraps of almsfood will seem to you like
boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out, served with many soups
and sauces seems to a householder or householder's child. It will be for
your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon
extinguishment.

As you live contented your lodging at the root of a tree will seem to
you like a bungalow, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with door
fastened and window shuttered seems to a householder or householder's
child. It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for
alighting upon extinguishment.

As you live contented your lodging at the root of a tree will seem to
you like a couch spread with woolen covers---shag-piled, pure white, or
embroidered with flowers---and spread with a fine deer hide, with a
canopy above and red pillows at both ends seems to a householder or
householder's child. It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort,
and for alighting upon extinguishment.

As you live contented your rancid urine as medicine will seem to you
like various medicines---ghee, butter, oil, honey, and molasses---seem
to a householder or householder's child. It will be for your enjoyment,
relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment. Well then,
Anuruddha, for the next rainy season residence you should stay right
here in the land of the Cetīs in the Eastern Bamboo Park."

"Yes, sir," Anuruddha replied.

After advising Anuruddha like this, the Buddha---as easily as a strong
person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Eastern
Bamboo Park in the land of the Cetīs and reappeared in the
deer park at Bhesakaḷā's Wood in the land of the Bhaggas.
He sat on the seat spread out and addressed the mendicants: "Mendicants,
I will teach you the eight thoughts of a great man. Listen ...

And what are the eight thoughts of a great man? This teaching is for
those of few wishes, not those of many wishes. It's for the contented,
not those who lack contentment. It's for the secluded, not those who
enjoy company. It's for the energetic, not the lazy. It's for the
mindful, not the unmindful. It's for those with immersion, not those
without immersion. It's for the wise, not the witless. It's for those
who don't enjoy proliferating and don't like to proliferate, not for
those who enjoy proliferating and like to proliferate.

'This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of many wishes.'
That's what I said, but why did I say it? A mendicant with few wishes
doesn't wish: 'May they know me as having few wishes!' When contented,
they don't wish: 'May they know me as contented!' When secluded, they
don't wish: 'May they know me as secluded!' When energetic, they don't
wish: 'May they know me as energetic!' When mindful, they don't wish:
'May they know me as mindful!' When immersed, they don't wish: 'May they
know me as immersed!' When wise, they don't wish: 'May they know me as
wise!' When not enjoying proliferation, they don't wish: 'May they know
me as one who doesn't enjoy proliferating!' 'This teaching is for those
of few wishes, not those of many wishes.' That's what I said, and this
is why I said it.

'This teaching is for the contented, not those who lack contentment.'
That's what I said, but why did I say it? It's for a mendicant who's
content with any kind of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and
supplies for the sick. 'This teaching is for the contented, not those
who lack contentment.' That's what I said, and this is why I said it.

'This teaching is for the secluded, not those who enjoy company.' That's
what I said, but why did I say it? It's for a mendicant who lives
secluded. But monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, rulers and their chief
ministers, monastics of other religions and their disciples go to visit
them. With a mind slanting, sloping, and inclining to seclusion,
withdrawn, and loving renunciation, that mendicant invariably gives each
of them a talk emphasizing the topic of dismissal. 'This teaching is for
the secluded, not those who enjoy company.' That's what I said, and this
is why I said it.

'This teaching is for the energetic, not the lazy.' That's what I said,
but why did I say it? It's for a mendicant who lives with energy roused
up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities.
They're strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to
developing skillful qualities. 'This teaching is for the energetic, not
the lazy.' That's what I said, and this is why I said it.

'This teaching is for the mindful, not the unmindful.' That's what I
said, but why did I say it? It's for a mendicant who's mindful. They
have utmost mindfulness and alertness, and can remember and recall what
was said and done long ago. 'This teaching is for the mindful, not the
unmindful.' That's what I said, and this is why I said it.

'This teaching is for those with immersion, not those without
immersion.' That's what I said, but why did I say it? It's for a
mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption ...
second absorption ... third absorption ... fourth absorption. 'This
teaching is for those with immersion, not those without immersion.'
That's what I said, and this is why I said it.

'This teaching is for the wise, not the witless.' That's what I said,
but why did I say it? It's for a mendicant who's wise. They have the
wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and
leads to the complete ending of suffering. 'This teaching is for the
wise, not the witless.' That's what I said, and this is why I said it.

'This teaching is for those who don't enjoy proliferating and don't like
to proliferate, not for those who enjoy proliferating and like to
proliferate.' That's what I said, but why did I say it? It's for a
mendicant whose mind leaps forth, gains confidence, settles down, and
becomes decided regarding the cessation of proliferation. 'This teaching
is for those who don't enjoy proliferating and don't like to
proliferate, not for those who enjoy proliferating and like to
proliferate.' That's what I said, and this is why I said it."

Then Anuruddha stayed the next rainy season residence right there in the
land of the Cetīs in the Eastern Bamboo Park. And
Anuruddha, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon
realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very
life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which
gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.

He understood: "Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been
completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further
for this place." And Venerable Anuruddha became one of the perfected.
And on the occasion of attaining perfection he recited these verses:

> "Knowing my thoughts,\
> the supreme Teacher in the world\
> came to me in a mind-made body,\
> using his psychic power.
>
> He taught me more\
> than I had thought of.\
> The Buddha who loves non-proliferation\
> taught me non-proliferation.
>
> Understanding that teaching,\
> I happily did his bidding.\
> I've attained the three knowledges,\
> and have fulfilled the Buddha's instructions."

## The Chapter on Giving

### AN 8.31 Giving (1st)  *Paṭhamadānasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these eight gifts. What eight? A person might
give a gift after insulting the recipient. Or they give out of fear. Or
they give thinking, 'They gave to me.' Or they give thinking, 'They'll
give to me.' Or they give thinking, 'It's good to give.' Or they give
thinking, 'I cook, they don't. It wouldn't be right for me to not give
to them.' Or they give thinking, 'By giving this gift I'll get a good
reputation.' Or they give thinking, 'This is an adornment and requisite
for the mind.' These are the eight gifts."

<!--pg-->
### AN 8.32 Giving (2nd)  *Dutiyadānasutta*

> "Faith, conscience, and skillful giving\
> are qualities true persons follow.\
> For this, they say, is the path of the gods,\
> which leads to the heavenly realm."

<!--pg-->
### AN 8.33 Reasons to Give  *Dānavatthusutta*

"Mendicants, there are these eight grounds for giving. What eight? A
person might give a gift out of favoritism or hostility or stupidity or
cowardice. Or they give thinking, 'Giving was practiced by my father and
my father's father. It would not be right for me to abandon this family
tradition.' Or they give thinking, 'After I've given this gift, when my
body breaks up, after death, I'll be reborn in a good place, a heavenly
realm.' Or they give thinking, 'When giving this gift my mind becomes
clear, and I become happy and joyful.' Or they give a gift thinking,
'This is an adornment and requisite for the mind.' These are the eight
grounds for giving."

<!--pg-->
### AN 8.34 A Field  *Khettasutta*

"Mendicants, when a field has eight factors a seed sown in it is not
very fruitful or rewarding or productive. What eight factors does it
have? It's when a field has mounds and ditches. It has stones and
gravel. It's salty. It doesn't have deep furrows. And it's not equipped
with water inlets, water outlets, irrigation channels, and boundaries.
When a field has these eight factors a seed sown in it is not fruitful
or rewarding or productive.

In the same way, when an ascetic or brahmin has eight factors a gift
given to them is not very fruitful or beneficial or splendid or
bountiful. What eight factors do they have? It's when an ascetic or
brahmin has wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong
livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong immersion. When
an ascetic or brahmin has these eight factors a gift given to them is
not very fruitful or beneficial or splendid or bountiful.

<!--pg-->
### AN 8.35 Rebirth by Giving  *Dānūpapattisutta*

"Mendicants, there are these eight rebirths by giving. What eight?

First, someone gives to ascetics or brahmins such things as food, drink,
clothing, vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and
lighting. Whatever they give they expect back. They see a well-to-do
aristocrat or brahmin or householder amusing themselves, supplied and
provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. It occurs to them:
'If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the
company of well-to-do aristocrats or brahmins or householders!' They
settle on that thought, stabilize it, and develop it. As they've settled
for less and not developed further, their thought leads to rebirth
there. When their body breaks up, after death, they're reborn in the
company of well-to-do aristocrats or brahmins or householders. But I say
that this is only for those of ethical conduct, not for the unethical.
The heart's wish of an ethical person succeeds because of their purity.

Next, someone gives to ascetics or brahmins ... Whatever they give they
expect back. And they've heard: 'The gods of the four great kings are
long-lived, beautiful, and very happy.' It occurs to them: 'If only,
when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of
the gods of the four great kings!' ... When their body breaks up, after
death, they're reborn in the company of the gods of the four great
kings. But I say that this is only for those of ethical conduct, not for
the unethical. The heart's wish of an ethical person succeeds because of
their purity.

Next, someone gives to ascetics or brahmins ... Whatever they give they
expect back. And they've heard: 'The gods of the thirty-three ...'

'The gods of Yama ...'

'The joyful gods ...'

'The gods who love to imagine ...'

'The gods who control what is imagined by others are long-lived,
beautiful, and very happy.' It occurs to them: 'If only, when my body
breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of the gods who
control what is imagined by others!' They settle on that thought,
stabilize it, and develop it. As they've settled for less and not
developed further, their thought leads to rebirth there. When their body
breaks up, after death, they're reborn in the company of the gods who
control what is imagined by others. But I say that this is only for
those of ethical conduct, not for the unethical. The heart's wish of an
ethical person succeeds because of their purity.

Next, someone gives to ascetics or brahmins such things as food, drink,
clothing, vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and
lighting. Whatever they give they expect back. And they've heard: 'The
gods of the Divinity's host are long-lived, beautiful, and very happy.'
It occurs to them: 'If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I
would be reborn in the company of the gods of the Divinity's host!' They
settle on that thought, stabilize it, and develop it. As they've settled

there. When their body breaks up, after death, they're reborn in the
company of the gods of the Divinity's host. But I say that this is only
for those of ethical conduct, not for the unethical. And for those free
of desire, not those with desire. The heart's wish of an ethical person
succeeds because of their freedom from desire.

These are the eight rebirths by giving."

### AN 8.36 Grounds for Making Merit  *Puññakiriyavatthusutta*

"Mendicants, there are these three grounds for making merit. What three?
Giving, ethical conduct, and meditation are all grounds for making
merit.

First, someone has practiced a little giving and ethical conduct as
grounds for making merit, but they haven't got as far as meditation as a
ground for making merit. When their body breaks up, after death, they're
reborn among disadvantaged humans.

Next, someone has practiced a moderate amount of giving and ethical
conduct as grounds for making merit, but they haven't got as far as
meditation as a ground for making merit. When their body breaks up,
after death, they're reborn among well-off humans.

Next, someone has practiced a lot of giving and ethical conduct as
grounds for making merit, but they haven't got as far as meditation as a
ground for making merit. When their body breaks up, after death, they're
reborn in the company of the gods of the four great kings. There, the
four great kings themselves have practiced giving and ethical conduct as
grounds for making merit to a greater degree than the other gods. So
they surpass them in ten respects: heavenly lifespan, beauty, happiness,
glory, sovereignty, sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches.

lord of gods, has practiced giving and ethical conduct as grounds for
making merit to a greater degree than the other gods. So he surpasses
them in ten respects ...

ground for making merit. When their body breaks up, after death, they're
reborn in the company of the gods of Yama. There, the god
Suyāma has practiced giving and ethical conduct as grounds
for making merit to a greater degree than the other gods. So he
surpasses them in ten respects ...

Next, someone has practiced a lot of giving and ethical conduct as
grounds for making merit, but they haven't got as far as meditation as a
ground for making merit. When their body breaks up, after death, they're
reborn in the company of the joyful gods. There, the god Santusita has
practiced giving and ethical conduct as grounds for making merit to a
greater degree than the other gods. So he surpasses them in ten respects
...

Next, someone has practiced a lot of giving and ethical conduct as
grounds for making merit, but they haven't got as far as meditation as a
ground for making merit. When their body breaks up, after death, they're
reborn in the company of the gods who love to imagine. There, the god
Sunimmita has practiced giving and ethical conduct as grounds for making
merit to a greater degree than the other gods. So he surpasses them in
ten respects ...

Next, someone has practiced a lot of giving and ethical conduct as
grounds for making merit, but they haven't got as far as meditation as a
ground for making merit. When their body breaks up, after death, they're
reborn in the company of the gods who control what is imagined by
others. There, the god Vasavattī has practiced giving and
ethical conduct as grounds for making merit to a greater degree than the
other gods. So he surpasses them in ten respects: heavenly lifespan,
beauty, happiness, glory, sovereignty, sights, sounds, smells, tastes,
and touches.

These are the three grounds for making merit."

### AN 8.37 Gifts of a True Person  *Sappurisadānasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these eight gifts of a true person. What eight?
Their gift is pure, good quality, timely, appropriate, intelligent, and
regular. While giving their heart is confident, and afterwards they're
uplifted. These are the eight gifts of a true person.

> He gives pure, good quality, and timely gifts\
> of appropriate food and drinks\
> regularly to spiritual practitioners\
> who are fertile fields of merit.
>
> They never regret\

> Discerning people praise\

> in a happy, pleasing world."

<!--pg-->
### AN 8.38 A True Person  *Sappurisasutta*

"Mendicants, a true person is born in a family for the benefit, welfare,
and happiness of the people. For the benefit, welfare, and happiness of
mother and father; children and partners; bondservants, workers, and
staff; friends and colleagues; departed ancestors; the king; the
deities; and ascetics and brahmins.

It's like a great rain cloud, which nourishes all the crops for the
benefit, welfare, and happiness of the people. In the same way, a true
person is born in a family for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of
the people. ...

> A wise person living at home\
> benefits many people.\
> Neither by day or at night do they neglect\
> their mother, father, and ancestors.\
> They venerate them in accord with the teaching,\

> In fact, they're good for everyone,\
> well grounded in the true teaching.\
> Rid of the stain of stinginess,\
> they'll enjoy a world of grace."

<!--pg-->
### AN 8.39 Overflowing Merit  *Abhisandasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these eight kinds of overflowing merit,
overflowing goodness. They nurture happiness and are conducive to
heaven, ripening in happiness and leading to heaven. They lead to what
is likable, desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness. What eight?

Firstly, a noble disciple has gone for refuge to the Buddha. This is the
first kind of overflowing merit ...

Furthermore, a noble disciple has gone for refuge to the teaching. This
is the second kind of overflowing merit ...

Furthermore, a noble disciple has gone for refuge to the
Saṅgha. This is the third kind of overflowing merit ...

Mendicants, these five gifts are great, primordial, long-standing,
traditional, and ancient. They are uncorrupted, as they have been since
the beginning. They're not being corrupted now nor will they be.
Sensible ascetics and brahmins don't look down on them. What five?

Firstly, a noble disciple gives up killing living creatures. By so doing
they give to countless sentient beings the gift of freedom from fear,
enmity, and ill will. And they themselves also enjoy unlimited freedom
from fear, enmity, and ill will. This is the first gift that is a great
offering, primordial, long-standing, traditional, and ancient. It is
uncorrupted, as it has been since the beginning. It's not being
corrupted now nor will it be. Sensible ascetics and brahmins don't look
down on it. This is the fourth kind of overflowing merit ...

Furthermore, a noble disciple gives up stealing. ... This is the fifth
kind of overflowing merit ...

Furthermore, a noble disciple gives up sexual misconduct. ... This is
the sixth kind of overflowing merit ...

Furthermore, a noble disciple gives up lying. ... This is the seventh
kind of overflowing merit ...

Furthermore, a noble disciple gives up beer, wine, and liquor
intoxicants. By so doing they give to countless sentient beings the gift
of freedom from fear, enmity, and ill will. And they themselves also
enjoy unlimited freedom from fear, enmity, and ill will. This is the
fifth gift that is a great offering, primordial, long-standing,
traditional, and ancient. It is uncorrupted, as it has been since the
beginning. It's not being corrupted now nor will it be. Sensible
ascetics and brahmins don't look down on it. This is the eighth kind of
overflowing merit ...

These are the eight kinds of overflowing merit, overflowing goodness.
They nurture happiness and are conducive to heaven, ripening in
happiness and leading to heaven. They lead to what is likable,
desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness."

### AN 8.40 The Results of Misconduct  *Duccaritavipākasutta*

"Mendicants, the killing of living creatures, when cultivated,
developed, and practiced, leads to hell, the animal realm, or the ghost
realm. The minimum result it leads to for a human being is a short
lifespan.

Stealing, when cultivated, developed, and practiced, leads to hell, the
animal realm, or the ghost realm. The minimum result it leads to for a
human being is loss of wealth.

Sexual misconduct, when cultivated, developed, and practiced, leads to
hell, the animal realm, or the ghost realm. The minimum result it leads
to for a human being is rivalry and enmity.

Lying, when cultivated, developed, and practiced, leads to hell, the
animal realm, or the ghost realm. The minimum result it leads to for a
human being is false accusations.

Divisive speech, when cultivated, developed, and practiced, leads to
hell, the animal realm, or the ghost realm. The minimum result it leads
to for a human being is being divided against friends.

Harsh speech, when cultivated, developed, and practiced, leads to hell,
the animal realm, or the ghost realm. The minimum result it leads to for
a human being is hearing disagreeable things.

Talking nonsense, when cultivated, developed, and practiced, leads to
hell, the animal realm, or the ghost realm. The minimum result it leads
to for a human being is that no-one takes what you say seriously.

Drinking beer and wine, when cultivated, developed, and practiced, leads
to hell, the animal realm, or the ghost realm. The minimum result it
leads to for a human being is madness."

## The Chapter on Sabbath

### AN 8.41 The Sabbath With Eight Factors, In Brief  *Saṁkhittūposathasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, the observance of the sabbath with its eight factors is
very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful. And how should
it be observed? It's when a noble disciple reflects: 'As long as they
live, the perfected ones give up killing living creatures, renouncing
the rod and the sword. They are scrupulous and kind, and live full of
sympathy for all living beings. I, too, for this day and night will give
up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. I'll be
scrupulous and kind, and live full of sympathy for all living beings. I
will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this
respect.' This is its first factor.

'As long as they live, the perfected ones give up stealing. They take
only what's given, and expect only what's given. They keep themselves
clean by not thieving. I, too, for this day and night will give up
stealing. I'll take only what's given, and expect only what's given.
I'll keep myself clean by not thieving. I will observe the sabbath by
doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.' This is its second
factor.

'As long as they live, the perfected ones give up unchastity. They are
celibate, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex. I, too, for this
day and night will give up unchastity. I will be celibate, set apart,
avoiding the vulgar act of sex. I will observe the sabbath by doing as
the perfected ones do in this respect.' This is its third factor.

'As long as they live, the perfected ones give up lying. They speak the
truth and stick to the truth. They're honest and trustworthy, and don't
trick the world with their words. I, too, for this day and night will
give up lying. I'll speak the truth and stick to the truth. I'll be
honest and dependable, and won't trick the world with my words. I will
observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.'
This is its fourth factor.

'As long as they live, the perfected ones give up beer, wine, and liquor
intoxicants. I, too, for this day and night will give up beer, wine, and
liquor intoxicants. I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected
ones do in this respect.' This is its fifth factor.

'As long as they live, the perfected ones eat in one part of the day,
abstaining from eating at night and from food at the wrong time. I, too,
for this day and night will eat in one part of the day, abstaining from
eating at night and food at the wrong time. I will observe the sabbath
by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.' This is its sixth
factor.

'As long as they live, the perfected ones give up seeing shows of
dancing, singing, and music ; and beautifying and adorning themselves
with garlands, fragrance, and makeup. I, too, for this day and night
will give up seeing shows of dancing, singing, and music ; and
beautifying and adorning myself with garlands, fragrance, and makeup. I
will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this
respect.' This is its seventh factor.

'As long as they live, the perfected ones give up high and luxurious
beds. They sleep in a low place, either a small bed or a straw mat. I,
too, for this day and night will give up high and luxurious beds. I'll
sleep in a low place, either a small bed or a straw mat. I will observe
the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.' This is
its eighth factor.

The observance of the sabbath with its eight factors in this way is very
fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful."

<!--pg-->
### AN 8.42 The Sabbath With Eight Factors, In Detail  *Vitthatūposathasutta*

"Mendicants, the observance of the sabbath with its eight factors is
very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful. And how should
it be observed?

It's when a noble disciple reflects: 'As long as they live, the
perfected ones give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and
the sword. They are scrupulous and kind, and live full of sympathy for
all living beings. I, too, for this day and night will give up killing
living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. I'll be scrupulous
and kind, and live full of sympathy for all living beings. I will
observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.'
This is its first factor. ...

'As long as they live, the perfected ones give up high and luxurious
beds. They sleep in a low place, either a small bed or a straw mat. I,
too, for this day and night will give up high and luxurious beds. I'll
sleep in a low place, either a small bed or a straw mat. I will observe
the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.' This is
its eighth factor. The observance of the sabbath with its eight factors
in this way is very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful.

How much so? Suppose you were to rule as sovereign lord over these
sixteen great countries---Aṅga, Magadha, Kāsi,
Kosala, Vajji, Malla, Cetī, Vaccha, Kuru,
Pañcāla, Maccha, Sūrasena, Assaka, Avanti,
Gandhāra, and Kamboja---full of the seven kinds of precious
things. This wouldn't be worth a sixteenth part of the sabbath with its
eight factors. Why is that? Because human kingship is a poor thing
compared to the happiness of the gods.

Fifty years in the human realm is one day and night for the gods of the
four great kings. Thirty such days make up a month. Twelve such months
make up a year. The lifespan of the gods of the four great kings is five
hundred of these heavenly years. It's possible that some woman or man
who has observed the eight-factored sabbath will---when their body
breaks up, after death---be reborn in the company of the gods of the
four great kings. This is what I was referring to when I said: 'Human
kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.'

A hundred years in the human realm is one day and night for the gods of
the thirty-three. Thirty such days make up a month. Twelve such months
make up a year. The lifespan of the gods of the thirty-three is a
thousand of these heavenly years. It's possible that some woman or man
who has observed the eight-factored sabbath will---when their body
breaks up, after death---be reborn in the company of the gods of the
thirty-three. This is what I was referring to when I said: 'Human
kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.'

Two hundred years in the human realm is one day and night for the gods
of Yama. Thirty such days make up a month. Twelve such months make up a
year. The lifespan of the gods of Yama is two thousand of these heavenly
years. It's possible that some woman or man who has observed the
eight-factored sabbath will---when their body breaks up, after
death---be reborn in the company of the gods of Yama. This is what I was
referring to when I said: 'Human kingship is a poor thing compared to
the happiness of the gods.'

Four hundred years in the human realm is one day and night for the
joyful gods. Thirty such days make up a month. Twelve such months make
up a year. The lifespan of the joyful gods is four thousand of these
heavenly years. It's possible that some woman or man who has observed
the eight-factored sabbath will---when their body breaks up, after
death---be reborn in the company of the joyful gods. This is what I was
referring to when I said: 'Human kingship is a poor thing compared to
the happiness of the gods.'

Eight hundred years in the human realm is one day and night for the gods
who love to imagine. Thirty such days make up a month. Twelve such
months make up a year. The lifespan of the gods who love to imagine is
eight thousand of these heavenly years. It's possible that some woman or
man who has observed the eight-factored sabbath will---when their body
breaks up, after death---be reborn in the company of the gods who love
to imagine. This is what I was referring to when I said: 'Human kingship
is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.'

Sixteen hundred years in the human realm is one day and night for the
gods who control what is imagined by others. Thirty such days make up a
month. Twelve such months make up a year. The lifespan of the gods who
control what is imagined by others is sixteen thousand of these heavenly
years. It's possible that some woman or man who has observed the
eight-factored sabbath will---when their body breaks up, after
death---be reborn in the company of the gods who control what is
imagined by others. This is what I was referring to when I said: 'Human
kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.'

### AN 8.43 With Visākhā on the Sabbath  *Visākhāsutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the
stilt longhouse of Migāra's mother in the Eastern
Monastery. Then Visākhā, Migāra's mother, went
up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to
her:

"Visākhā, the observance of the sabbath with its eight

### AN 8.44 With Vāseṭṭha on the Sabbath  *Vāseṭṭhasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the
Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then the layman
Vāseṭṭha went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one
side. The Buddha said to him:

"Vāseṭṭha, the observance of the sabbath with its eight
factors is very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful ...
blameless, they go to a heavenly place."

When he said this, Vāseṭṭha said to the Buddha:

"If my loved ones---relatives and kin---were to observe this sabbath
with its eight factors, it would be for their lasting welfare and
happiness. If all the aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials were
to observe this sabbath with its eight factors, it would be for their
lasting welfare and happiness."

"That's so true, Vāseṭṭha! That's so true,
Vāseṭṭha! If all the aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and
menials were to observe this sabbath with its eight factors, it would be
for their lasting welfare and happiness. If the whole world---with its
gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its
ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans---were to observe this sabbath
with its eight factors, it would be for their lasting welfare and
happiness. If these great sal trees were to observe this sabbath with
its eight factors, it would be for their lasting welfare and
happiness---if they were sentient. How much more then a human being!"

gods who control what is imagined by others. Thirty such days make up a
month. Twelve such months make up a year. The lifespan of the gods who
Control what is imagined by Others is sixteen thousand of these heavenly
years. It's possible that some woman or man who has observed the
eight-factored sabbath will---when their body breaks up, after
death---be reborn in the company of the gods who control what is
imagined by others. This is what I was referring to when I said: 'Human
kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.'

> You shouldn't kill living creatures, or steal,\
> or lie, or drink liquor.\
> Be celibate, refraining from sex,\
> and don't eat at night, the wrong time.
>
> Not wearing garlands or applying fragrance,\
> you should sleep on a low bed,\
> \>or a mat on the ground.\
> This is the eight-factored sabbath, they say,\
> explained by the Buddha,\
> \>who has gone to suffering's end.
>
> The moon and sun are both fair to see,\
> radiating as far as they revolve.\
> Those dispellers of darkness, travellers in midair,\
> shine in the firmament, lighting up the quarters.
>
> All of the wealth that's found in this realm---\
> pearls, gems, fine beryl too,\
> mountain gold or pure gold,\
> or the native gold called 'coruscant'---
>
> they're not worth a sixteenth part\
> of the mind developed with love,\
> as starlight cannot rival the moon.
>
> So an ethical woman or man,\
> who has observed the eight-factored sabbath,\
> having made merit whose outcome is happiness,\
> blameless, they go to a heavenly place."

### AN 8.46 Anuruddha and the Agreeable Deities  *Anuruddhasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī, in
Ghosita's Monastery.

Now at that time Venerable Anuruddha had gone into retreat for the day's
meditation. Then several deities of the Agreeable Host went up to
Venerable Anuruddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:

"Honorable Anuruddha, we are the deities called 'Agreeable'. We wield
authority and control over three things. We can turn any color we want
on the spot. We can get any voice that we want on the spot. We can get
any pleasure that we want on the spot. We are the deities called
'Agreeable'. We wield authority and control over these three things."

Then Venerable Anuruddha thought, "If only these deities would all turn
blue, of blue color, clad in blue, adorned with blue!" Then those
deities, knowing Anuruddha's thought, all turned blue.

Then Venerable Anuruddha thought, "If only these deities would all turn
yellow ..."

"If only these gods would all turn red ..."

"If only these gods would all turn white ..." Then those deities,
knowing Anuruddha's thought, all turned white.

Then one of those deities sang, one danced, and one snapped her fingers.
Suppose there was a quintet made up of skilled musicians who had
practiced well and kept excellent rhythm. They'd sound graceful,
tantalizing, sensuous, lovely, and intoxicating. In the same way the
performance by those deities sounded graceful, tantalizing, sensuous,
lovely, and intoxicating. But Venerable Anuruddha averted his senses.

Then those deities, thinking "Master Anuruddha isn't enjoying this,"
vanished right there. Then in the late afternoon, Anuruddha came out of
retreat and went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told
him what had happened, adding:

"How many qualities do females have so that---when their body breaks up,
after death---they are reborn in company with the Gods of the Agreeable
Host?"

"Anuruddha, when they have eight qualities females---when their body
breaks up, after death---are reborn in company with the Gods of the
Agreeable Host. What eight?

Take the case of a female whose mother and father give her to a husband
wanting what's best for her, out of kindness and sympathy. She would get
up before him and go to bed after him, and be obliging, behaving nicely
and speaking politely.

She honors, respects, esteems, and venerates those her husband respects,
such as mother and father, and ascetics and brahmins. And when they
arrive she serves them with a seat and water.

She's deft and tireless in her husband's household duties, such as
knitting and sewing. She understands how to go about things in order to
complete and organize the work.

She knows what work her husband's domestic bondservants, servants, and
workers have completed, and what they've left incomplete. She knows who
is sick, and who is fit or unwell. She distributes to each a fair
portion of fresh and cooked foods.

She ensures that any income her husband earns is guarded and protected,
whether money, grain, silver, or gold. She doesn't overspend, steal,
waste, or lose it.

She's a lay follower who has gone for refuge to the Buddha, his
teaching, and the Saṅgha.

She's ethical. She doesn't kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual
misconduct, lie, or consume beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants.

She's generous. She lives at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely
generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to
give and to share.

When they have these eight qualities females---when their body breaks
up, after death---are reborn in company with the Gods of the Agreeable
Host.

> She'd never look down on her husband,\
> who's always eager to work hard,\
> always looking after her,\
> and bringing whatever she wants.
>
> And a good woman never scolds her husband\
> with jealous words.\
> Being astute, she reveres\
> those respected by her husband.
>
> She gets up early, works tirelessly,\
> and manages the domestic help.\
> She's agreeable to her husband,\
> and preserves his wealth.
>
> A lady who fulfills these duties\
> according to her husband's desire,\
> is reborn among the gods\
> called 'Agreeable'."

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the
stilt longhouse of Migāra's mother in the Eastern
Monastery. Then Visākhā, Migāra's mother, went
up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to
her:

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas at

the housewife Nakula's mother went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down

### AN 8.49 Winning in This Life (1st)  *Paṭhamaidhalokikasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the
stilt longhouse of Migāra's mother in the Eastern
Monastery. Then Visākhā, Migāra's mother, went
up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to
her:

"Visākhā, a female who has four qualities is practicing to
win in this life, and she succeeds at it. What four? It's when a female
is well-organized at work, manages the domestic help, acts lovingly
toward her husband, and preserves his earnings.

And how is a female well-organized at work? It's when she's deft and

consider agreeable, even for the sake of her own life. That's how a
female acts lovingly toward her husband.

And how does a female preserve his earnings? It's when she ensures that
any income her husband earns is guarded and protected, whether money,
grain, silver, or gold. She doesn't overspend, steal, waste, or lose it.

A female who has four qualities is practicing to win in the next life,

faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom.

And how is a female accomplished in faith? It's when a female has faith
in the Realized One's awakening: 'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully
awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of
the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods
and humans, awakened, blessed.' That's how a female is accomplished in
faith.

And how is a female accomplished in ethics? It's when a female doesn't
kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or consume
beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants. That's how a female is accomplished
in ethics.

home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed,

## The Chapter on Gotamī

### AN 8.51 With Gotamī  *Gotamīsutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near
Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. Then
Mahāpajāpati Gotamī went up to the Buddha,
bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, please let females gain the going forth from the lay life to
homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized
One."

"Enough, Gotamī. Don't endorse the going forth for females
from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training
proclaimed by the Realized One."

For a second time ...

For a third time, Mahāpajāpati Gotamī said to
the Buddha:

"Sir, please let females gain the going forth from the lay life to
homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized
One."

"Enough, Gotamī. Don't endorse the going forth for females
from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training
proclaimed by the Realized One."

Then Mahāpajāpati Gotamī thought, "The Buddha
does not permit females to go forth." Miserable and sad, weeping, with a
tearful face, she bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping
him on her right, before leaving.

When the Buddha had stayed in Kapilavatthu as long as he pleased, he set
out for Vesālī. Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at
Vesālī, where he stayed at the Great Wood, in the hall with
the peaked roof. Then Mahāpajāpati Gotamī had
her hair shaved, and dressed in ocher robes. Together with several
Sakyan ladies she set out for Vesālī. Traveling stage by
stage, she arrived at Vesālī and went to the Great Wood,
the hall with the peaked roof. Then Mahāpajāpati
Gotamī stood crying outside the gate, her feet swollen, her
limbs covered with dust, miserable and sad, with tearful face.

Venerable Ānanda saw her standing there, and said to her,
"Gotamī, why do you stand crying outside the gate, your
feet swollen, your limbs covered with dust, miserable and sad, with
tearful face?"

"Honorable Ānanda, it's because the Buddha does not permit females to go
forth in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One."

"Well then, Gotamī, wait here an hour while I ask the
Buddha to grant the going forth for females."

Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to him:

"Sir, Mahāpajāpati Gotamī is standing crying
outside the gate, her feet swollen, her limbs covered with dust,
miserable and sad, with tearful face. She says that it's because the
Buddha does not permit females to go forth. Sir, please let females gain
the going forth from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and
training proclaimed by the Realized One."

"Enough, Ānanda. Don't endorse the going forth for females from the lay
life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the
Realized One."

For a second time ...

For a third time, Ānanda said to the Buddha:

"Sir, please let females gain the going forth from the lay life to
homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized
One."

"Enough, Ānanda. Don't endorse the going forth for females from the lay
life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the
Realized One."

Then Venerable Ānanda thought, "The Buddha does not permit females to go
forth. Why don't I try another approach?"

Then Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, "Sir, is a female able to
realize the fruits of stream-entry, once-return, non-return, and
perfection once she has gone forth?"

"She is able, Ānanda."

"If a female is able to realize the fruits of stream-entry, once-return,
non-return, and perfection once she has gone forth. Sir,
Mahāpajāpati has been very helpful to the Buddha. She is
his aunt who raised him, nurtured him, and gave him her milk. When the
Buddha's birth mother passed away, she nurtured him at her own breast.
Sir, please let females gain the going forth from the lay life to
homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized
One."

"Ānanda, if Mahāpajāpati Gotamī accepts these
eight principles of respect, that will be her ordination.

A nun, even if she has been ordained for a hundred years, should bow
down to a monk who was ordained that very day. She should rise up for
him, greet him with joined palms, and observe proper etiquette toward
him. This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and
venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts.

A nun should not commence the rainy season residence in a monastery
without monks. This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed,
and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts.

Each fortnight the nuns should expect two things from the community of
monks: the date of the sabbath, and visiting for advice. This principle
should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not
transgressed so long as life lasts.

After completing the rainy season residence the nuns should invite
admonition from the communities of both monks and nuns in regard to
anything that was seen, heard, or suspected. This principle should be
honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so
long as life lasts.

A nun who has committed a grave offense should undergo penance in the
communities of both monks and nuns for a fortnight. This principle
should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not
transgressed so long as life lasts.

A trainee nun who has trained in the six rules for two years should seek
ordination from the communities of both monks and nuns. This principle
should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not
transgressed so long as life lasts.

A nun should not abuse or insult a monk in any way. This principle
should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not
transgressed so long as life lasts.

From this day forth it is forbidden for nuns to criticize monks, but it
is not forbidden for monks to criticize nuns. This principle should be
honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so
long as life lasts.

If Mahāpajāpati Gotamī accepts these eight
principles of respect, that will be her ordination."

Then Ānanda, having learned these eight principles of respect from the
Buddha himself, went to Mahāpajāpati Gotamī
and said:

"Gotamī, if you accept eight principles of respect, that
will be your ordination.

A nun, even if she has been ordained for a hundred years, should bow
down to a monk who was ordained that very day. She should rise up for
him, greet him with joined palms, and observe proper etiquette toward
him. This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and
venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts. ...

From this day forth it is forbidden for nuns to criticize monks, but it
is not forbidden for monks to criticize nuns. This principle should be
honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so
long as life lasts. If you accept these eight principles of respect,
that will be your ordination."

"Ānanda, suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and
fond of adornments, and had bathed their head. After getting a garland
of lotuses, jasmine, or liana flowers, they would take them in both
hands and place them on the crown of the head. In the same way, sir, I
accept these eight principles of respect as not to be transgressed so
long as life lasts."

Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to the Buddha:

"Sir, Mahāpajāpati Gotamī has accepted the
eight principles of respect as not to be transgressed so long as life
lasts."

"Ānanda, if females had not gained the going forth from the lay life to
homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized
One, the spiritual life would have lasted long. The true teaching would
have remained for a thousand years. But since they have gained the going
forth, now the spiritual life will not last long. The true teaching will
remain only five hundred years.

It's like those families with many women and few men. They're easy prey
for bandits and thieves. In the same way, the spiritual life does not
last long in a teaching and training where females gain the going forth.

It's like a field full of rice. Once the disease called 'white bones'
attacks, it doesn't last long. In the same way, the spiritual life does
not last long in a teaching and training where females gain the going
forth.

It's like a field full of sugar cane. Once the disease called 'red rot'
attacks, it doesn't last long. In the same way, the spiritual life does
not last long in a teaching and training where females gain the going
forth.

As a man might build a dyke around a large lake as a precaution against
the water overflowing, in the same way as a precaution I've prescribed
the eight principles of respect as not to be transgressed so long as
life lasts."

### AN 8.52 An Adviser for Nuns  *Ovādasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the
Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then Venerable Ānanda went
up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:

"Sir, how many qualities should a monk have to be deemed an adviser for
nuns?"

"Ānanda, a monk with eight qualities may be deemed an adviser for nuns.
What eight?

Firstly, a monk is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting
themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger
in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they've undertaken.

They're learned, remembering and keeping what they've learned. These
teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the
end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that's
totally full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings,
remembering them, reciting them, mentally scrutinizing them, and
comprehending them theoretically.

Both monastic codes have been passed down to them in detail, well
analyzed, well mastered, well evaluated in both the rules and
accompanying material.

They're a good speaker who enunciates well. Their voice is polished,
clear, articulate, and expresses the meaning.

They're able to educate, encourage, fire up, and inspire the community
of nuns.

They're likable and agreeable to most of the nuns.

They have never previously sexually harassed any woman wearing the ocher
robe who has gone forth in the Buddha's name.

They have been ordained for twenty years or more.

A monk with these eight qualities may be deemed an adviser for nuns."

### AN 8.53 Brief Advice to Gotamī  *Saṁkhittasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the
Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then
Mahāpajāpati Gotamī went up to the Buddha,
bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I've heard
it, I'll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute."

"Gotamī, you might know that certain things lead to
passion, not dispassion; to yoking, not to unyoking; to accumulation,
not dispersal; to more desires, not fewer; to lack of contentment, not
contentment; to crowding, not seclusion; to laziness, not energy; to
being burdensome, not being unburdensome. Categorically, you should
remember these things as not the teaching, not the training, and not the
Teacher's instructions.

You might know that certain things lead to dispassion, not passion; to

### AN 8.54 With Dīghajāṇu  *Dīghajāṇusutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Koliyans, where
they have a town named Kakkarapatta. Then Dīghajāṇu the
Koliyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to
the Buddha:

"Sir, we are laypeople who enjoy sensual pleasures and living at home
with our children. We use sandalwood imported from Kāsi, we
wear garlands, fragrance, and makeup, and we accept gold and currency.
May the Buddha please teach us the Dhamma in a way that leads to our
welfare and happiness in this life and in future lives."

"Byagghapajja, these four things lead to the welfare and happiness of a
gentleman in this life. What four?

Accomplishment in initiative, protection, good friendship, and balanced
finances. And what is accomplishment in initiative? It's when a
gentleman earns a living by means such as farming, trade, raising
cattle, archery, government service, or one of the professions. He
understands how to go about these things in order to complete and
organize the work. This is called accomplishment in initiative.

And what is accomplishment in protection? It's when a gentleman owns
legitimate wealth that he has earned by his own efforts and initiative,
built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow. He
ensures it is guarded and protected, thinking: 'How can I prevent my
wealth from being taken by rulers or bandits, consumed by fire, swept
away by flood, or taken by unloved heirs?' This is called accomplishment
in protection.

And what is accomplishment in good friendship? It's when a gentleman
resides in a town or village. And in that place there are householders
or their children who may be young or old, but are mature in conduct,
accomplished in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom. He associates
with them, converses and engages in discussion. And he emulates the same
kind of accomplishment in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom. This is
called accomplishment in good friendship.

And what is accomplishment in balanced finances? It's when a gentleman,
knowing his income and expenditure, balances his finances, being neither
too extravagant nor too frugal. He thinks, 'In this way my income will
exceed my expenditure, not the reverse.' It's like an appraiser or their
apprentice who, holding up the scales, knows that it's low by this much
or high by this much. In the same way, a gentleman, knowing his income
and expenditure, balances his finances, being neither too extravagant
nor too frugal. He thinks, 'In this way my income will exceed my
expenditure, not the reverse.' If a gentleman has little income but an
opulent life, people will say: 'This gentleman eats their wealth like a
fig-eater!' If a gentleman has a large income but a spartan life, people
will say: 'This gentleman is starving themselves to death!' But a
gentleman, knowing his income and expenditure, leads a balanced life,
neither too extravagant nor too frugal, thinking, 'In this way my income
will exceed my expenditure, not the reverse.' This is called
accomplishment in balanced finances.

There are four drains on wealth that has been gathered in this way.
Womanizing, drinking, gambling, and having bad friends, companions, and
associates. Suppose there was a large reservoir with four inlets and
four drains. And someone was to open up the drains and close off the
inlets, and the heavens don't provide enough rain. You'd expect that
large reservoir to dwindle, not expand. In the same way, there are four
drains on wealth that has been gathered in this way. Womanizing,
drinking, gambling, and having bad friends, companions, and associates.

There are four inlets for wealth that has been gathered in this way. Not

the Realized One's awakening: 'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully
awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of
the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods
and humans, awakened, blessed.' This is called accomplishment in faith.

And what is accomplishment in ethics? It's when a gentleman doesn't kill
living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or consume beer,
wine, and liquor intoxicants. This is called accomplishment in ethics.

And what is accomplishment in generosity? It's when a gentleman lives at
home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed,
loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.
This is called accomplishment in generosity.

And what is accomplishment in wisdom? It's when a gentleman is wise. He
has the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative,
and leads to the complete ending of suffering. This is called
accomplishment in wisdom.

### AN 8.55 With Ujjaya  *Ujjayasutta*

Then Ujjaya the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings
with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat
down to one side and said to the Buddha:

"Mister Gotama, we wish to travel abroad. May the Buddha please teach us
the Dhamma in a way that leads to our welfare and happiness in this life
and in future lives."

"Brahmin, these four things lead to the welfare and happiness of a
gentleman in this life. What four? Accomplishment in initiative,
protection, good friendship, and balanced finances.

And what is accomplishment in initiative? A gentleman may earn a living
by means such as farming, trade, raising cattle, archery, government
service, or one of the professions. He understands how to go about these
things in order to complete and organize the work. This is called
accomplishment in initiative.

And what is accomplishment in protection? It's when a gentleman owns
legitimate wealth that he has earned by his own efforts and initiative,
built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow. He
ensures it is guarded and protected, thinking: 'How can I prevent my
wealth from being taken by rulers or bandits, consumed by fire, swept
away by flood, or taken by unloved heirs?' This is called accomplishment
in protection.

And what is accomplishment in good friendship? It's when a gentleman
resides in a town or village. And in that place there are householders
or their children who may be young or old, but are mature in conduct,
accomplished in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom. He associates
with them, converses and engages in discussion. And he emulates the same
kind of accomplishment in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom. This is
called accomplishment in good friendship.

### AN 8.56 Danger  *Bhayasutta*

"Mendicants, 'danger' is a term for sensual pleasures. 'Suffering',
'disease', 'boil', 'dart', 'snare', 'bog', and 'womb' are terms for
sensual pleasures. And why is 'danger' a term for sensual pleasures?
Someone who is besotted by sensual greed and shackled by lustful desire
is not freed from dangers in this life or in lives to come. That is why
'danger' is a term for sensual pleasures. And why are 'suffering',
'disease', 'boil', 'dart', 'snare', 'bog', and 'womb' terms for sensual
pleasures? Someone who is besotted by sensual greed and shackled by
lustful desire is not freed from wombs in this life or in lives to come.
That is why 'womb' is a term for sensual pleasures.

> Danger, suffering, and disease,\
> boil, dart, and snare,\
> and bogs and wombs both.\
> These describe the sensual pleasures\
> to which ordinary people are attached.
>
> Swamped by things that seem pleasant,\
> you go to another womb.\

"Mendicants, a mendicant with eight qualities is worthy of offerings
dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious
donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme
field of merit for the world. What eight?

It's when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code,
conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places.
Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they've
undertaken.

They're learned, remembering and keeping what they've learned. These
teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the
end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that's
totally full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings,
remembering them, reciting them, mentally scrutinizing them, and
comprehending them theoretically.

They have good friends, companions, and associates.

They have right view, possessing right perspective.

They get the four absorptions---blissful meditations in this life that
belong to the higher mind---when they want, without trouble or
difficulty.

They recollect many kinds of past lives, with features and details.

With clairvoyance that is purified and surpasses the human, they see how
sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.

They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in
this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight
due to the ending of defilements.

"Mendicants, these eight people are found in the world. What eight?

First, when a mendicant stays secluded, living independently, a desire
arises for material things. They try hard, strive, and make an effort to
get them. But material things don't come to them. And so they sorrow and

they don't get those material things. This is called a mendicant who

### AN 8.63 A Teaching in Brief  *Saṁkhittasutta*

Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and
said to him, "Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When
I've heard it, I'll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and
resolute."

"This is exactly how some silly people ask me for something. But when
the teaching has been explained they think only of following me around."

"Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief! May the Holy One
teach me the Dhamma in brief! Hopefully I can understand the meaning of
what the Buddha says! Hopefully I can be an heir of the Buddha's
teaching!"

"Well then, mendicant, you should train like this: 'My mind will be
steady and well settled internally. And bad, unskillful qualities that
have arisen will not occupy my mind.' That's how you should train.

When your mind is steady and well settled internally, and bad,
unskillful qualities that have arisen don't occupy your mind, then you
should train like this: 'I will develop the heart's release by love.
I'll cultivate it, make it my vehicle and my basis, keep it up,
consolidate it, and properly implement it.' That's how you should train.

When this immersion is developed and cultivated in this way, you should
develop it while placing the mind and keeping it connected. You should
develop it without placing the mind, merely keeping it connected. You
should develop it without placing the mind or keeping it connected. You
should develop it with rapture. You should develop it without rapture.
You should develop it with pleasure. You should develop it with
equanimity.

When this immersion is well developed in this way, you should train like
this: 'I will develop the heart's release by compassion ...' ... 'I will
develop the heart's release by rejoicing ...' ... 'I will develop the
heart's release by equanimity. I'll cultivate it, make it my vehicle and
my basis, keep it up, consolidate it, and properly implement it.' That's
how you should train.

When this immersion is well developed in this way, you should develop it
while placing the mind and keeping it connected. You should develop it
without placing the mind, merely keeping it connected. You should
develop it without placing the mind or keeping it connected. You should
develop it with rapture. You should develop it without rapture. You
should develop it with pleasure. You should develop it with equanimity.

When this immersion is well developed in this way, you should train like
this: 'I'll meditate observing an aspect of the body---keen, aware, and
mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.' That's how
you should train.

When this immersion is developed and cultivated in this way, you should
develop it while placing the mind and keeping it connected. You should

When this immersion is well developed in this way, you should train like
this: 'I'll meditate on an aspect of feelings ...' ... 'I'll meditate on
an aspect of the mind ...' ... 'I'll meditate on an aspect of
principles---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and
displeasure for the world.' That's how you should train.

When this immersion is developed and cultivated in this way, you should
develop it while placing the mind and keeping it connected. You should
develop it without placing the mind, merely keeping it connected. You
should develop it without placing the mind or keeping it connected. You

You should develop it with pleasure. You should develop it with
equanimity.

When this immersion is well developed in this way, wherever you walk,
you'll walk comfortably. Wherever you stand, you'll stand comfortably.
Wherever you sit, you'll sit comfortably. Wherever you lie down, you'll
lie down comfortably."

When that mendicant had been given this advice by the Buddha, he got up
from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him
on his right, before leaving.

Then that mendicant, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and
resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in
this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal
for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.

He understood: "Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been
completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further
for this place." And that mendicant became one of the perfected.

### AN 8.64 At Gayā Head  *Gayāsīsasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Gayā on
Gayā Head. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:

"Mendicants, before my awakening---when I was still not awake but intent
on awakening---I perceived light but did not see forms.

Then it occurred to me, 'What if I were to both perceive light and see
forms? Then my knowledge and vision would become even more purified.'

So after some time, living diligent, keen, and resolute, I perceived
light and saw forms. But I didn't associate with those deities,
converse, or engage in discussion.

Then it occurred to me, 'What if I were to perceive light and see forms;
and associate with those deities, converse, and engage in discussion?
Then my knowledge and vision would become even more purified.'

So after some time ... I perceived light and saw forms. And I associated
with those deities, conversed, and engaged in discussion. But I didn't
know which orders of gods those deities came from.

Then it occurred to me, 'What if I were to perceive light and see forms;
and associate with those deities, converse, and engage in discussion;
and find out which orders of gods those deities come from? Then my
knowledge and vision would become even more purified.'

So after some time ... I perceived light and saw forms. And I associated

deities came from. But I didn't know what deeds caused those deities to
be reborn there after passing away from here.

So after some time ... I found out what deeds caused those deities to be
reborn there after passing away from here. But I didn't know what deeds
caused those deities to have such food and such an experience of
pleasure and pain.

So after some time ... I found out what deeds caused those deities to
have such food and such an experience of pleasure and pain. But I didn't
know that these deities have a lifespan of such a length.

So after some time ... I found out that these deities have a lifespan of
such a length. But I didn't know whether or not I had previously lived
together with those deities.

Then it occurred to me, 'What if I were to perceive light and see forms;

and find out which orders of gods those deities come from; and what
deeds caused those deities to be reborn there after passing away from
here; and what deeds caused those deities to have such food and such an
experience of pleasure and pain; and that these deities have a lifespan
of such a length; and whether or not I have previously lived together
with those deities? Then my knowledge and vision would become even more
purified.'

So after some time ... I found out whether or not I have previously
lived together with those deities.

As long as my knowledge and vision about the deities was not fully
purified in these eight rounds, I didn't announce my supreme perfect
awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and
Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and
humans.

But when my knowledge and vision about the deities was fully purified in
these eight rounds, I announced my supreme perfect awakening in this
world with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population
with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. Knowledge and
vision arose in me: 'My freedom is unshakable; this is my last rebirth;
now there'll be no more future lives.'"

### AN 8.65 Dimensions of Mastery  *Abhibhāyatanasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these eight dimensions of mastery. What eight?

Perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally, limited, both
pretty and ugly. Mastering them, they perceive: 'I know and see.' This
is the first dimension of mastery.

Perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally, limitless,
both pretty and ugly. Mastering them, they perceive: 'I know and see.'
This is the second dimension of mastery.

Not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally, limited,
both pretty and ugly. Mastering them, they perceive: 'I know and see.'
This is the third dimension of mastery.

Not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally,
limitless, both pretty and ugly. Mastering them, they perceive: 'I know
and see.' This is the fourth dimension of mastery.

Not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally, blue,
with blue color and blue appearance. Mastering them, they perceive: 'I
know and see.' This is the fifth dimension of mastery.

Not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally, yellow,
with yellow color and yellow appearance. Mastering them, they perceive:
'I know and see.' This is the sixth dimension of mastery.

Not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally, red, with
red color and red appearance. Mastering them, they perceive: 'I know and
see.' This is the seventh dimension of mastery.

### AN 8.66 Liberations  *Vimokkhasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these eight liberations. What eight? Having
physical form, they see forms. This is the first liberation.

Not perceiving form internally, they see forms externally. This is the
second liberation.

They're focused only on beauty. This is the third liberation.

Going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions
of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that
'space is infinite', they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite
space. This is the fourth liberation.

Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that
'consciousness is infinite', they enter and remain in the dimension of
infinite consciousness. This is the fifth liberation.

Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that
'there is nothing at all', they enter and remain in the dimension of
nothingness. This is the sixth liberation.

Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, they enter and remain
in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. This is the
seventh liberation.

Going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor
non-perception, they enter and remain in the cessation of perception and
feeling. This is the eighth liberation.

These are the eight liberations."

"Mendicants, there are these eight assemblies. What eight? The
assemblies of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and ascetics. An
assembly of the gods of the four great kings. An assembly of the gods of
the thirty-three. An assembly of Māras. An assembly of
divinities.

I recall having approached an assembly of hundreds of aristocrats. There
I used to sit with them, converse, and engage in discussion. And my
appearance and voice became just like theirs. I educated, encouraged,
fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk. But when I spoke they
didn't know: 'Who is this that speaks? Is it a god or a human?' And when
my Dhamma talk was finished I vanished. But when I vanished they didn't
know: 'Who was that who vanished? Was it a god or a human?'

### AN 8.70 Earthquakes  *Bhūmicālasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the
Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
entered Vesālī for alms. Then, after the meal, on his
return from almsround, he addressed Venerable Ānanda, "Ānanda, get your
sitting cloth. Let's go to the Cāpāla shrine for the day's
meditation."

"Yes, sir," replied Ānanda. Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind
the Buddha.

Then the Buddha went up to the Cāpāla shrine, where he sat
on the seat spread out. When he was seated he said to Venerable Ānanda:

"Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Seven
Maidens, Many Sons, Sārandada, and Cāpāla
Tree-shrines are all lovely. Whoever has developed and cultivated the
four bases of psychic power---made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them
up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them---may, if they
wish, live for the proper lifespan or what's left of it. The Realized
One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made
them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and
properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live for
the proper lifespan or what's left of it."

But Ānanda didn't get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious
hint, such a clear sign. He didn't beg the Buddha, "Sir, may the Blessed
One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the
eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of
sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods
and humans." For his mind was as if possessed by Māra.

For a second time ...

And for a third time, the Buddha said to him:

"Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Seven
Maidens, Many Sons, Sārandada, and Cāpāla
Tree-shrines are all lovely. Whoever has developed and cultivated the
four bases of psychic power---made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them
up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them---may, if they
wish, live for the proper lifespan or what's left of it. The Realized
One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made
them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and
properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live for
the proper lifespan or what's left of it."

But Ānanda didn't get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious
hint, such a clear sign. He didn't beg the Buddha, "Sir, may the Blessed
One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the
eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of
sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods
and humans." For his mind was as if possessed by Māra.

Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda, "Go now, Ānanda, at your
convenience."

"Yes, sir," replied Ānanda. He rose from his seat, bowed, and
respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before
sitting at the root of a tree close by.

And then, not long after Ānanda had left, Māra the Wicked
said to the Buddha:

"Sir, may the Blessed One now be fully extinguished! May the Holy One
now be fully extinguished! Now is the time for the full extinguishment
of the Buddha.

Sir, you once made this statement: 'Wicked One, I shall not be fully
extinguished until I have monk disciples who are competent, educated,
assured, learned, have memorized the teachings, and practice in line
with the teachings; not until they practice appropriately, living in
line with the teaching; not until they've learned their tradition, and
explain, teach, assert, establish, clarify, analyze, and reveal; not
until they can legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of
others that come up, and teach with a demonstrable basis.' Today you do
have such monk disciples.

May the Blessed One now be fully extinguished! May the Holy One now be
fully extinguished! Now is the time for the full extinguishment of the
Buddha.

Sir, you once made this statement: 'Wicked One, I shall not be fully
extinguished until I have nun disciples who are competent, educated,
assured, learned ...' ...

'Wicked One, I shall not be fully extinguished until I have layman
disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned ...' ...

'Wicked One, I shall not be fully extinguished until I have laywoman
disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned ...' ... Today
you do have such laywoman disciples.

Sir, may the Blessed One now be fully extinguished! May the Holy One be
fully extinguished! Now is the time for the full extinguishment of the
Buddha. Sir, you once made this statement:

'Wicked One, I shall not be fully extinguished until my spiritual path
is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well
proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.' Today your spiritual
path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and
well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.

Sir, may the Blessed One now be fully extinguished! May the Holy One be
fully extinguished! Now is the time for the full extinguishment of the
Buddha."

"Relax, Wicked One. The full extinguishment of the Realized One will be
soon. Three months from now the Realized One will be fully
extinguished."

So at the Cāpāla Tree-shrine the Buddha, mindful and aware,
surrendered the life force. When he did so there was a great earthquake,
awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky. Then,
understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this
heartfelt sentiment:

> "Comparing the incomparable\
> \>with the creation of prolonged life,\
> the sage surrendered the life force.\
> Happy inside, serene,\
> he shattered self-creation like a suit of armor."

Then Venerable Ānanda thought, "That was a really big earthquake! That
was really a very big earthquake; awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and
thunder cracked the sky! What's the cause, what's the reason for a great
earthquake?"

Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to him, "Sir, that was a really big earthquake! That was
really a very big earthquake; awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and
thunder cracked the sky! What's the cause, what's the reason for a great
earthquake?"

"Ānanda, there are these eight causes and reasons for a great
earthquake. What eight?

This great earth is grounded on water, the water is grounded on air, and
the air stands in space. At a time when a great wind blows, it stirs the
water, and the water stirs the earth. This is the first cause and reason
for a great earthquake.

Furthermore, there is an ascetic or brahmin with psychic power who has
achieved mastery of the mind, or a god who is mighty and powerful.
They've developed a limited perception of earth and a limitless
perception of water. They make the earth shake and rock and tremble.
This is the second cause and reason for a great earthquake.

Furthermore, when the being intent on awakening passes away from the
host of joyful gods, he's conceived in his mother's belly, mindful and
aware. Then the earth shakes and rocks and trembles. This is the third
cause and reason for a great earthquake.

Furthermore, when the being intent on awakening comes out of his
mother's belly mindful and aware, the earth shakes and rocks and
trembles. This is the fourth cause and reason for a great earthquake.

Furthermore, when the Realized One realizes the supreme perfect
awakening, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles. This is the fifth
cause and reason for a great earthquake.

Furthermore, when the Realized One rolls forth the supreme Wheel of
Dhamma, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles. This is the sixth cause
and reason for a great earthquake.

Furthermore, when the Realized One, mindful and aware, surrenders the
life force, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles. This is the seventh
cause and reason for a great earthquake.

Furthermore, when the Realized One becomes fully extinguished in the
element of extinguishment with no residue, the earth shakes and rocks
and trembles. This is the eighth cause and reason for a great
earthquake.

These are the eight causes and reasons for a great earthquake."

### AN 8.73 Mindfulness of Death (1st)  *Paṭhamamaraṇassatisutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying at Ñātika in the brick
house. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, when mindfulness of death is developed and cultivated it's
very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in freedom from death and
ends in freedom from death. But do you develop mindfulness of death?"

When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha, "Sir, I
develop mindfulness of death."

"But mendicant, how do you develop it?"

"In this case, sir, I think: 'Oh, if I'd only live for another day and
night, I'd focus on the Buddha's instructions and I could really achieve
a lot.' That's how I develop mindfulness of death."

Another mendicant said to the Buddha, "Sir, I too develop mindfulness of
death."

"But mendicant, how do you develop it?"

"In this case, sir, I think: 'Oh, if I'd only live for another day, I'd
focus on the Buddha's instructions and I could really achieve a lot.'
That's how I develop mindfulness of death."

Another mendicant said to the Buddha, "Sir, I too develop mindfulness of
death."

"But mendicant, how do you develop it?"

"In this case, sir, I think: 'Oh, if I'd only live for half a day, I'd
focus on the Buddha's instructions and I could really achieve a lot.'
That's how I develop mindfulness of death."

Another mendicant said to the Buddha, "Sir, I too develop mindfulness of
death."

"But mendicant, how do you develop it?"

"In this case, sir, I think: 'Oh, if I'd only live as long as it takes
to eat a single almsmeal, I'd focus on the Buddha's instructions and I
could really achieve a lot.' That's how I develop mindfulness of death."

Another mendicant said to the Buddha, "Sir, I too develop mindfulness of
death."

"But mendicant, how do you develop it?"

"In this case, sir, I think: 'Oh, if I'd only live as long as it takes
to eat half an almsmeal, I'd focus on the Buddha's instructions and I
could really achieve a lot.' That's how I develop mindfulness of death."

Another mendicant said to the Buddha, "Sir, I too develop mindfulness of
death."

"But mendicant, how do you develop it?"

"In this case, sir, I think: 'Oh, if I'd only live as long as it takes
to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls, I'd focus on the Buddha's
instructions and I could really achieve a lot.' That's how I develop
mindfulness of death."

Another mendicant said to the Buddha, "Sir, I too develop mindfulness of
death."

"But mendicant, how do you develop it?"

"In this case, sir, I think: 'Oh, if I'd only live as long as it takes
to chew and swallow a single mouthful, I'd focus on the Buddha's
instructions and I could really achieve a lot.' That's how I develop
mindfulness of death."

Another mendicant said to the Buddha, "Sir, I too develop mindfulness of
death."

"But mendicant, how do you develop it?"

"In this case, sir, I think: 'Oh, if I'd only live as long as it takes
to breathe out after breathing in, or to breathe in after breathing out,
I'd focus on the Buddha's instructions and I could really achieve a
lot.' That's how I develop mindfulness of death."

When this was said, the Buddha said to those mendicants:

"The mendicants who develop mindfulness of death by wishing to live for
a day and night ... or to live for a day ... or to live for half a day
... or to live as long as it takes to eat a meal of almsfood ... or to
live as long as it takes to eat half a meal of almsfood ... or to live
as long as it takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls ... These
are called mendicants who live negligently. They slackly develop
mindfulness of death for the ending of defilements.

But the mendicants who develop mindfulness of death by wishing to live
as long as it takes to chew and swallow a single mouthful ... or to live
as long as it takes to breathe out after breathing in, or to breathe in
after breathing out ... These are called mendicants who live diligently.
They keenly develop mindfulness of death for the ending of defilements.

So you should train like this: 'We will live diligently. We will keenly
develop mindfulness of death for the ending of defilements.' That's how
you should train."

### AN 8.74 Mindfulness of Death (2nd)  *Dutiyamaraṇassatisutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying at Ñātika in the brick
house. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: "Mendicants, when
mindfulness of death is developed and cultivated it's very fruitful and
beneficial. It culminates in freedom from death and ends in freedom from
death.

And how is mindfulness of death developed and cultivated to be very
fruitful and beneficial, to culminate in freedom from death and end in
freedom from death? As day passes by and night draws close, a mendicant
reflects: 'I might die of many causes. A snake might bite me, or a
scorpion or centipede might sting me. And if I died from that it would
be an obstacle to my progress. Or I might stumble off a cliff, or get
food poisoning, or suffer a disturbance of bile, phlegm, or piercing
winds. Or I might be attacked by humans or non-humans. And if I died
from that it would be an obstacle to my progress.' That mendicant should
reflect: 'Are there any bad, unskillful qualities that I haven't given
up, which might be an obstacle to my progress if I die tonight?'

Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that there are such bad,
unskillful qualities. Then in order to give them up they should apply
intense enthusiasm, effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and
situational awareness.

Suppose your clothes or head were on fire. In order to extinguish it,
you'd apply intense enthusiasm, effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance,
mindfulness, and situational awareness. In the same way, in order to
give up those bad, unskillful qualities, that mendicant should apply
intense enthusiasm ...

But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that there are no
such bad, unskillful qualities. Then that mendicant should meditate with
rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.

Or else, as night passes by and day draws close, a mendicant reflects:
'I might die of many causes. A snake might bite me, or a scorpion or
centipede might sting me. And if I died from that it would be an
obstacle to my progress. Or I might stumble off a cliff, or get food
poisoning, or suffer a disturbance of bile, phlegm, or piercing winds.
Or I might be attacked by humans or non-humans. And if I died from that
it would be an obstacle to my progress.' That mendicant should reflect:
'Are there any bad, unskillful qualities that I haven't given up, which
might be an obstacle to my progress if I die today?'

Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that there are such bad,
unskillful qualities. Then in order to give them up they should apply
intense enthusiasm, effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and
situational awareness.

Suppose your clothes or head were on fire. In order to extinguish it,
you'd apply intense enthusiasm, effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance,
mindfulness, and situational awareness. In the same way, in order to
give up those bad, unskillful qualities, that mendicant should apply
intense enthusiasm ...

But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that there are no
such bad, unskillful qualities. Then that mendicant should meditate with
rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.
Mindfulness of death, when developed and cultivated in this way, is very
fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in freedom from death and ends in
freedom from death."

### AN 8.75 Accomplishments (1st)  *Paṭhamasampadāsutta*

"Mendicants, there are these eight accomplishments. What eight?
Accomplishment in initiative, protection, good friendship, and balanced
finances. And accomplishment in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom.
These are the eight accomplishments.

> They're enterprising in the workplace,\

> This is how, for a householder,\
> merit grows by generosity."

<!--pg-->
### AN 8.76 Accomplishments (2nd)  *Dutiyasampadāsutta*

"Mendicants, there are these eight accomplishments. What eight?
Accomplishment in initiative, protection, good friendship, and balanced
finances. And accomplishment in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom.

And what is accomplishment in initiative? It's when a gentleman earns a
living by means such as farming, trade, raising cattle, archery,
government service, or one of the professions. He understands how to go
about these things in order to complete and organize the work. This is
called accomplishment in initiative.

And what is accomplishment in protection? It's when a gentleman owns
legitimate wealth that he has earned by his own efforts and initiative,
built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow. He
ensures it is guarded and protected, thinking: 'How can I prevent my
wealth from being taken by rulers or bandits, consumed by fire, swept
away by flood, or taken by unloved heirs?' This is called accomplishment
in protection.

And what is accomplishment in good friendship? It's when a gentleman
resides in a town or village. And in that place there are householders
or their children who may be young or old, but are mature in conduct,
accomplished in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom. He associates
with them, converses and engages in discussion. And he emulates the same
kind of accomplishment in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom. This is
called accomplishment in good friendship.

And what is accomplishment in balanced finances? It's when a gentleman,
knowing his income and expenditure, balances his finances, being neither
too extravagant nor too frugal. He thinks, 'In this way my income will
exceed my expenditure, not the reverse.' It's like an appraiser or their
apprentice who, holding up the scales, knows that it's low by this much
or high by this much. In the same way, a gentleman, knowing his income
and expenditure, balances his finances, being neither too extravagant
nor too frugal. He thinks, 'In this way my income will exceed my
expenditure, not the reverse.' If a gentleman has little income but an
opulent life, people will say: 'This gentleman eats their wealth like a
fig-eater!' If a gentleman has a large income but a spartan life, people
will say: 'This gentleman is starving themselves to death!' But a
gentleman, knowing his income and expenditure, leads a balanced life,
neither too extravagant nor too frugal, thinking, 'In this way my income
will exceed my expenditure, not the reverse.' This is called
accomplishment in balanced finances.

And what is accomplishment in faith? It's when a gentleman has faith in
the Realized One's awakening: 'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully
awakened Buddha ... teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.' This
is called accomplishment in faith.

And what is accomplishment in ethics? It's when a gentleman doesn't kill
living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or consume beer,
wine, and liquor intoxicants. This is called accomplishment in ethics.

And what is accomplishment in generosity? It's when a gentleman lives at
home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed,
loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.
This is called accomplishment in generosity.

And what is accomplishment in wisdom? It's when a gentleman is wise. He
has the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative,
and leads to the complete ending of suffering. This is called
accomplishment in wisdom.

These are the eight accomplishments.

> They're enterprising in the workplace,\
> diligent in managing things,\
> they balance their finances,\
> and preserve their wealth.
>

### AN 8.77 Desires  *Icchāsutta*

There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants: "Reverends,
mendicants!"

"Reverend," they replied. Sāriputta said this:

"Reverends, these eight people are found in the world. What eight?

First, when a mendicant stays secluded, living independently, a desire
arises for material things. They try hard, strive, and make an effort to
get them. But material things don't come to them. And so they sorrow and
wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion because
they don't get those material things. This is called a mendicant who
lives desiring material things. They try hard, strive, and make an
effort to get them. But when they do not acquire material things, they
sorrow and lament. They've fallen from the true teaching.

Next, when a mendicant stays secluded, living independently, a desire
arises for material things. They try hard, strive, and make an effort to
get them. And material things do come to them. And so they become
indulgent and fall into negligence regarding those material things. This
is called a mendicant who lives desiring material things. They try hard,
strive, and make an effort to get them. And when they acquire material
things, they become intoxicated and negligent. They've fallen from the

"These eight things lead to the decline of a mendicant trainee. What
eight? They relish work, talk, sleep, and company. They don't guard the
sense doors and they eat too much. They relish closeness and
proliferation. These eight things lead to the decline of a mendicant

### AN 8.80 Grounds for Laziness and Arousing Energy  *Kusītārambhavatthusutta*

"Mendicants, there are eight grounds for laziness. What eight?

Firstly, a mendicant has some work to do. They think: 'I have some work
to do. But while doing it my body will get tired. I'd better have a lie
down.' They lie down, and don't rouse energy for attaining the
unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized. This
is the first ground for laziness.

Furthermore, a mendicant has done some work. They think: 'I've done some
work. But while working my body got tired. I'd better have a lie down.'
They lie down, and don't rouse energy for attaining the unattained,
achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized. This is the
second ground for laziness.

Furthermore, a mendicant has to go on a journey. They think: 'I have to
go on a journey. But while walking my body will get tired. I'd better
have a lie down.' They lie down, and don't rouse energy for attaining
the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.
This is the third ground for laziness.

Furthermore, a mendicant has gone on a journey. They think: 'I've gone
on a journey. But while walking my body got tired. I'd better have a lie
down.' They lie down, and don't rouse energy for attaining the
unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized. This
is the fourth ground for laziness.

Furthermore, a mendicant has wandered for alms, but they didn't get to
fill up on as much food as they like, coarse or fine. They think: 'I've
wandered for alms, but I didn't get to fill up on as much food as I
like, coarse or fine. My body is tired and unfit for work. I'd better
have a lie down.' They lie down, and don't rouse energy for achieving
the unachieved, attaining the unattained, and realizing the unrealized.
This is the fifth ground for laziness.

Furthermore, a mendicant has wandered for alms, and they got to fill up
on as much food as they like, coarse or fine. They think: 'I've wandered
for alms, and I got to fill up on as much food as I like, coarse or
fine. My body is heavy, unfit for work, like I've just eaten a load of
beans. I'd better have a lie down.' They lie down, and don't rouse
energy for achieving the unachieved, attaining the unattained, and
realizing the unrealized. This is the sixth ground for laziness.

Furthermore, a mendicant feels a little sick. They think: 'I feel a
little sick. Lying down would be good for me. I'd better have a lie
down.' They lie down, and don't rouse energy for achieving the
unachieved, attaining the unattained, and realizing the unrealized. This
is the seventh ground for laziness.

Furthermore, a mendicant has recently recovered from illness. They
think: 'I've recently recovered from illness. My body is weak and unfit
for work. I'd better have a lie down.' They lie down, and don't rouse
energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and
realizing the unrealized. This is the eighth ground for laziness. These
are the eight grounds for laziness.

There are eight grounds for arousing energy. What eight? Firstly, a
mendicant has some work to do. They think: 'I have some work to do.
While working it's not easy to focus on the instructions of the Buddhas.
I'd better preemptively rouse up energy for attaining the unattained,
achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.' They rouse
energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and
realizing the unrealized. This is the first ground for arousing energy.

Furthermore, a mendicant has done some work. They think: 'I've done some
work. While I was working I wasn't able to focus on the instructions of
the Buddhas. I'd better preemptively rouse up energy for attaining the
unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.'
They rouse up energy ... This is the second ground for arousing energy.

Furthermore, a mendicant has to go on a journey. They think: 'I have to
go on a journey. While walking it's not easy to focus on the
instructions of the Buddhas. I'd better preemptively rouse up energy
...' ... This is the third ground for arousing energy.

Furthermore, a mendicant has gone on a journey. They think: 'I've gone
on a journey. While I was walking I wasn't able to focus on the
instructions of the Buddhas. I'd better preemptively rouse up energy
...' ... This is the fourth ground for arousing energy.

Furthermore, a mendicant has wandered for alms, but they didn't get to
fill up on as much food as they like, coarse or fine. They think: 'I've
wandered for alms, but I didn't get to fill up on as much food as I
like, rough or fine. My body is light and fit for work. I'd better
preemptively rouse up energy ...' ... This is the fifth ground for
arousing energy.

Furthermore, a mendicant has wandered for alms, and they got to fill up
on as much food as they like, coarse or fine. They think: 'I've wandered
for alms, and I got to fill up on as much food as I like, coarse or
fine. My body is strong and fit for work. I'd better preemptively rouse
up energy ...' ... This is the sixth ground for arousing energy.

Furthermore, a mendicant feels a little sick. They think: 'I feel a
little sick. It's possible this illness will worsen. I'd better
preemptively rouse up energy ...' ... This is the seventh ground for
arousing energy.

Furthermore, a mendicant has recently recovered from illness. They
think: 'I've recently recovered from illness. It's possible the illness
will come back. I'd better preemptively rouse up energy for attaining
the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.'
They rouse energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the
unachieved, and realizing the unrealized. This is the eighth ground for
arousing energy.

These are the eight grounds for arousing energy."

## The Chapter on Mindfulness

### AN 8.81 Mindfulness and Situational Awareness  *Satisampajaññasutta*

"Mendicants, when there is no mindfulness and situational awareness, one
who lacks mindfulness and situational awareness has destroyed a vital
condition for conscience and prudence. When there is no conscience and
prudence, one who lacks conscience and prudence has destroyed a vital
condition for sense restraint. When there is no sense restraint, one who
lacks sense restraint has destroyed a vital condition for ethical
conduct. When there is no ethical conduct, one who lacks ethics has
destroyed a vital condition for right immersion. When there is no right
immersion, one who lacks right immersion has destroyed a vital condition
for true knowledge and vision. When there is no true knowledge and
vision, one who lacks true knowledge and vision has destroyed a vital
condition for disillusionment and dispassion. When there is no
disillusionment and dispassion, one who lacks disillusionment and
dispassion has destroyed a vital condition for knowledge and vision of
freedom.

Suppose there was a tree that lacked branches and foliage. Its shoots,
bark, softwood, and heartwood would not grow to fullness.

In the same way, when there is no mindfulness and situational awareness,
one who lacks mindfulness and situational awareness has destroyed a
vital condition for conscience and prudence. When there is no conscience
and prudence ... One who lacks disillusionment and dispassion has
destroyed a vital condition for knowledge and vision of freedom.

When there is mindfulness and situational awareness, one who has
fulfilled mindfulness and situational awareness has fulfilled a vital
condition for conscience and prudence. When there is conscience and
prudence, one who has fulfilled conscience and prudence has fulfilled a
vital condition for sense restraint. When there is sense restraint, one
who has fulfilled sense restraint has fulfilled a vital condition for

### AN 8.82 With Puṇṇiya  *Puṇṇiyasutta*

Then Venerable Puṇṇiya went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat
down to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, what is the cause, what is the reason why sometimes the Realized
One feels inspired to teach, and other times not?"

"Puṇṇiya, when a mendicant has faith but doesn't approach,
the Realized One doesn't feel inspired to teach. But when a mendicant
has faith and approaches, the Realized One feels inspired to teach. When
a mendicant has faith and approaches, but doesn't pay homage ... they
pay homage, but don't ask questions ... they ask questions, but don't
actively listen to the teaching ... they actively listen to the
teaching, but don't remember the teaching they've heard ... they
remember the teaching they've heard, but don't reflect on the meaning of
the teachings they've remembered ... they reflect on the meaning of the
teachings they've remembered, but, not having understood the meaning and
the teaching, they don't practice accordingly. The Realized One doesn't
feel inspired to teach.

But when a mendicant has faith, approaches, pays homage, asks questions,
actively listen to the teachings, remembers the teachings, reflects on
the meaning, and practices accordingly, the Realized One feels inspired
to teach. When someone has these eight qualities, the Realized One feels
totally inspired to teach."

### AN 8.83 Rooted  *Mūlakasutta*

"Mendicants, if wanderers of other religions were to ask: 'Reverends,
all things have what as their root? What produces them? What is their
origin? What is their meeting place? What is their chief? What is their
ruler? What is their overseer? What is their core?' How would you answer
them?"

"Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge.
Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The
mendicants will listen and remember it."

"Well then, mendicants, I will teach it. Listen and apply your mind
well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, if wanderers of other religions were to ask: 'Reverends,
all things have what as their root? What produces them? What is their
origin? What is their meeting place? What is their chief? What is their
ruler? What is their overseer? What is their core?' You should answer
them: 'Reverends, all things are rooted in desire. They are produced by
application of mind. Contact is their origin. Feeling is their meeting
place. Immersion is their chief. Mindfulness is their ruler. Wisdom is
their overseer. Freedom is their core.' When questioned by wanderers of
other religions, that's how you should answer them."

### AN 8.84 A Master Thief  *Corasutta*

"Mendicants, a master thief with eight factors is soon executed, and
doesn't have long to live. What eight? He attacks unprovoked. He steals
everything without exception. He kills a woman. He rapes a girl. He robs
a monk. He robs the royal treasury. He works close to home. He's not
skilled at hiding his booty. A master thief with these eight factors is
soon executed, and doesn't have long to live.

### AN 8.85 Terms for the Realized One  *Samaṇasutta*

"'Ascetic' is a term for the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully
awakened Buddha. 'Brahmin', 'Knowledge Master', 'Healer', 'Unstained',
'Immaculate', 'Knower', and 'Freed' are terms for the Realized One, the
perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.

> The supreme should be attained by an ascetic,\
> a brahmin who has lived the life;\

### AN 8.86 With Nāgita  *Yasasutta*

At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans
together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived
at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Icchānaṅgala. He
stayed in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. The brahmins and
householders of Icchānaṅgala heard:

"It seems the ascetic Gotama---a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan
family---has arrived at Icchānaṅgala. He is staying in a
forest near Icchānaṅgala. He has this good reputation:
'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in
knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for
those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.'
... It's good to see such perfected ones."

Then, when the night had passed, they took abundant fresh and cooked
foods and went to the forest near Icchānaṅgala, where they
stood outside the gates making a dreadful racket.

Now, at that time Venerable Nāgita was the Buddha's
attendant. Then the Buddha said to Nāgita,
"Nāgita, who's making that dreadful racket? You'd think it
was fishermen hauling in a catch!"

"Sir, it's these brahmins and householders of Icchānaṅgala.
They've brought abundant fresh and cooked foods, and they're standing
outside the gates wanting to offer it specially to the Buddha and the
mendicant Saṅgha."

"Nāgita, may I never become famous. May fame not come to
me. There are those who can't get the pleasure of renunciation, the
pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the pleasure of awakening
when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can. Let them enjoy
the filthy, lazy pleasure of possessions, honor, and popularity."

"Sir, may the Blessed One please relent now! May the Holy One relent!
Now is the time for the Buddha to relent. Wherever the Buddha now goes,
the brahmins and householders, and people of town and country will
incline the same way. It's like when the heavens rain heavily and the
water flows downhill. In the same way, wherever the Buddha now goes, the
brahmins and householders, and people of town and country will incline
the same way. Why is that? Because of the Buddha's ethics and wisdom."

"Nāgita, may I never become famous. May fame not come to
me. There are those who can't get the pleasure of renunciation, the
pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the pleasure of awakening
when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can. Let them enjoy
the filthy, lazy pleasure of possessions, honor, and popularity.

Even some of the deities can't get the pleasure of renunciation, the
pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the pleasure of awakening
when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can. When you all
come together to enjoy each other's company, I think: 'These venerables
mustn't get the pleasure of renunciation, the pleasure of seclusion, the
pleasure of peace, the pleasure of awakening when they want, without
trouble or difficulty like I can. That must be because they come
together to enjoy each other's company.'

Take mendicants I see poking each other with their fingers, giggling and
playing together. I think to myself: 'These venerables mustn't get the
pleasure of renunciation, the pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of
peace, the pleasure of awakening when they want, without trouble or
difficulty like I can. That must be because they're poking each other
with their fingers, giggling and playing together.'

Take mendicants I see eat as much as they like until their bellies are
full, then indulge in the pleasures of sleeping, lying down, and
drowsing. I think to myself: 'These venerables mustn't get the pleasure
of renunciation, the pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the
pleasure of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like
I can. That must be because they eat as much as they like until their
bellies are full, then indulge in the pleasures of sleeping, lying down,
and drowsing.'

Take a mendicant living within a village who I see sitting immersed in
samādhi. I think to myself: 'Now a monastery worker, a
novice, or a fellow practitioner will make this venerable fall from
immersion.' So I'm not pleased that that mendicant is living within a
village.

Take a mendicant in the wilderness who I see sitting nodding in
meditation. I think to myself: 'Now this venerable, having dispelled
that sleepiness and weariness, will focus just on the unified perception
of wilderness.' So I'm pleased that that mendicant is living in the
wilderness.

Take a mendicant in the wilderness who I see sitting without being
immersed in samādhi. I think to myself: 'Now if this
venerable's mind is not immersed in samādhi they will
immerse it; or if it is immersed in samādhi, they will
preserve it.' So I'm pleased that that mendicant is living in the
wilderness.

Take a mendicant in the wilderness who I see sitting immersed in
samādhi. I think to myself: 'Now this venerable will free
the unfreed mind or preserve the freed mind.' So I'm pleased that that
mendicant is living in the wilderness.

Take a mendicant who I see living within a village receiving robes,
almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. Enjoying
possessions, honor, and popularity they neglect retreat, and they
neglect remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. They come down
to villages, towns and capital cities and make their homes there. So I'm
not pleased that that mendicant is living within a village.

Take a mendicant who I see in the wilderness receiving robes, almsfood,
lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. Fending off
possessions, honor, and popularity they don't neglect retreat, and they
don't neglect remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. So I'm
pleased that that mendicant is living in the wilderness.

Nāgita, when I'm walking along a road and I don't see
anyone ahead or behind I feel relaxed, even if I need to urinate or
defecate."

people against each other. They criticize the Buddha, the teaching, and

in a mendicant who has eight qualities. What eight? They don't try to
prevent the lay people from getting material things. They don't try to
harm lay people. They don't insult and abuse lay people. They don't
divide lay people against each other. They don't criticize the Buddha,
the teaching, and the Saṅgha. They're not seen at an
inappropriate place for collecting alms. The lay followers may, if they
wish, make a proclamation of confidence in a mendicant who has these
eight qualities."

### AN 8.89 Reconciliation  *Paṭisāraṇīyasutta*

"Mendicants, the Saṅgha may, if it wishes, perform an act
requiring that a mendicant who has eight qualities should pursue
reconciliation. What eight? They try to prevent the lay people from
getting material things. They try to harm lay people. They insult and
abuse lay people. They divide lay people against each other. They
criticize the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha. They
don't keep a legitimate promise made to a lay person. The
Saṅgha may, if it wishes, perform an act requiring that a
mendicant who has eight qualities should pursue reconciliation.

The Saṅgha may, if it wishes, revoke the act requiring that
a mendicant who has eight qualities should pursue reconciliation. What
eight? They don't try to prevent the lay people from getting material
things. They don't try to harm lay people. They don't insult and abuse
lay people. They don't divide lay people against each other. They don't
criticize the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha. They

### AN 8.90 Proper Behavior in a Case of Aggravated Misconduct  *Sammāvattanasutta*

"Mendicants, a mendicant who has been convicted of aggravated misconduct
must behave themselves properly in eight respects. They must not perform
an ordination, give dependence, or be attended by a novice. They must
not consent to being appointed as adviser for nuns, and if they are
appointed they should not give such advice. They must not consent to any
Saṅgha appointment. They must not be put in a position of
seniority. They must not resolve others from any offense similar to that
which they have transgressed. A mendicant who has been convicted of
aggravated misconduct must behave themselves properly in these eight

# The Book of the Nines


## The Chapter on Awakening

### AN 9.1 Awakening  *Sambodhisutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:

"Mendicants, if wanderers of other religions were to ask: 'Reverends,
what is the vital condition for the development of the awakening
factors?' How would you answer them?"

"Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. ... The mendicants will listen
and remember it."

"Well then, mendicants, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, if wanderers of other religions were to ask: 'Reverends,
what is the vital condition for the development of the awakening
factors?' You should answer them:

'It's when a mendicant has good friends, companions, and associates.
This is the first vital condition for the development of the awakening
factors.

Furthermore, a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code,
conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places.
Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they've
undertaken. This is the second vital condition for the development of
the awakening factors.

Furthermore, a mendicant gets to take part in talk about self-effacement
that helps open the heart, when they want, without trouble or
difficulty. That is, talk about fewness of wishes, contentment,
seclusion, aloofness, arousing energy, ethics, immersion, wisdom,
freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom. This is the third
vital condition for the development of the awakening factors.

Furthermore, a mendicant lives with energy roused up for giving up
unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They are strong,
staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing
skillful qualities. This is the fourth vital condition for the
development of the awakening factors.

Furthermore, a mendicant is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and
passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete
ending of suffering. This is the fifth vital condition for the
development of the awakening factors.'

A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to
be ethical ...

A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to
take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart ...

A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to
live with energy roused up ...

A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to
be wise ...

But then, a mendicant grounded on these five things should develop four
further things. They should develop the perception of ugliness to give
up greed, love to give up hate, mindfulness of breathing to cut off
thinking, and perception of impermanence to uproot the conceit 'I am'.
When you perceive impermanence, the perception of not-self becomes
stabilized. Perceiving not-self, you uproot the conceit 'I am' and
attain extinguishment in this very life."

<!--pg-->
### AN 9.2 Supported  *Nissayasutta*

Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and
said to him:

"Sir, they speak of being 'supported'. How is a mendicant who is
supported defined?"

"Mendicant, if a mendicant supported by faith gives up the unskillful
and develops the skillful, the unskillful is actually given up by them.

If a mendicant supported by conscience ...

If a mendicant supported by prudence ...

If a mendicant supported by energy ...

If a mendicant supported by wisdom gives up the unskillful and develops
the skillful, the unskillful is actually given up by them. What's been
given up is completely given up when it has been given up by seeing with
noble wisdom.

But then, a mendicant grounded on these five things should rely on four
things. What four? After appraisal, a mendicant uses some things,
endures some things, avoids some things, and gets rid of some things.
That's how a mendicant is supported."

<!--pg-->
### AN 9.3 With Meghiya  *Meghiyasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Cālikā, on the
Cālikā mountain.

Now, at that time Venerable Meghiya was the Buddha's attendant. Then
Venerable Meghiya went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and
said to him, "Sir, I'd like to enter Jantu village for alms."

"Please, Meghiya, go at your convenience."

Then Meghiya robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
entered Jantu village for alms. After the meal, on his return from
almsround in Jantu village, he went to the shore of
Kimikālā river. As he was going for a walk along the shore
of the river he saw a lovely and delightful mango grove.

It occurred to him, "Oh, this mango grove is lovely and delightful! This
is good enough for striving for a gentleman wanting to strive. If the
Buddha allows me, I'll come back to this mango grove to meditate."

Then Venerable Meghiya went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and told him what had happened, adding, "If the Buddha allows me,
I'll go back to that mango grove to meditate."

"We're alone, Meghiya. Wait until another mendicant comes."

For a second time Meghiya said to the Buddha, "Sir, the Buddha has
nothing more to do, and nothing that needs improvement. But I have. If
you allow me, I'll go back to that mango grove to meditate."

"We're alone, Meghiya. Wait until another mendicant comes."

For a third time Meghiya said to the Buddha, "Sir, the Buddha has
nothing more to do, and nothing that needs improvement. But I have. If
you allow me, I'll go back to that mango grove to meditate."

"Meghiya, since you speak of striving in meditation, what can I say?
Please, Meghiya, go at your convenience."

Then Meghiya got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the
Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went to that mango grove, and,
having plunged deep into it, sat at the root of a certain tree for the
day's meditation. But while Meghiya was meditating in that mango grove
he was beset mostly by three kinds of bad, unskillful thoughts, namely,
sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts.

Then he thought, "Oh, how incredible, how amazing! I've gone forth out
of faith from the lay life to homelessness, but I'm still harassed by
these three kinds of bad, unskillful thoughts: sensual, malicious, and
cruel thoughts."

Then Venerable Meghiya went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and told him what had happened.

"Meghiya, when the heart's release is not ripe, five things help it
ripen. What five?

Firstly, a mendicant has good friends, companions, and associates. This
is the first thing ...

Furthermore, a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code,
conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places.
Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they've
undertaken. This is the second thing ...

Furthermore, a mendicant gets to take part in talk about self-effacement
that helps open the heart, when they want, without trouble or
difficulty. That is, talk about fewness of wishes, contentment,
seclusion, aloofness, arousing energy, ethics, immersion, wisdom,
freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom. This is the third
thing ...

Furthermore, a mendicant lives with energy roused up for giving up
unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They are strong,
staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing
skillful qualities. This is the fourth thing ...

Furthermore, a mendicant is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and
passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete
ending of suffering. This is the fifth thing that, when the heart's
release is not ripe, helps it ripen.

A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to
be ethical ...

A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to
take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart ...

A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to
be energetic ...

A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to
be wise ...

But then, a mendicant grounded on these five things should develop four
further things. They should develop the perception of ugliness to give
up greed, love to give up hate, mindfulness of breathing to cut off
thinking, and perception of impermanence to uproot the conceit 'I am'.
When you perceive impermanence, the perception of not-self becomes
stabilized. Perceiving not-self, you uproot the conceit 'I am' and
attain extinguishment in this very life."

### AN 9.4 With Nandaka  *Nandakasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

Now at that time Venerable Nandaka was educating, encouraging, firing
up, and inspiring the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma
talk. Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and
went to the assembly hall. He stood outside the door waiting for the
talk to end. When he knew the talk had ended he cleared his throat and
knocked on the door-panel. The mendicants opened the door for the
Buddha, and he entered the assembly hall, where he sat on the seat
spread out.

He said to Nandaka, "Nandaka, that was a long exposition of the teaching
you gave to the mendicants. My back was aching while I stood outside the
door waiting for the talk to end."

When he said this, Nandaka felt embarrassed and said to the Buddha,
"Sir, we didn't know that the Buddha was standing outside the door. If
we'd known, I wouldn't have said so much."

Then the Buddha, knowing that Nandaka was embarrassed, said to him,
"Good, good, Nandaka! It's appropriate for gentlemen like you, who have
gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness, to sit
together for a Dhamma talk. When you're sitting together you should do
one of two things: discuss the teachings or keep noble silence.

Nandaka, a mendicant is faithful but not ethical. So they're incomplete
in that respect, and should fulfill it, thinking, 'How can I become
faithful and ethical?' When a mendicant is faithful and ethical, they're
complete in that respect.

A mendicant is faithful and ethical, but does not get internal serenity
of heart. So they're incomplete in that respect, and should fulfill it,
thinking, 'How can I become faithful and ethical and get internal
serenity of heart?' When a mendicant is faithful and ethical and gets
internal serenity of heart, they're complete in that respect.

A mendicant is faithful, ethical, and gets internal serenity of heart,
but they don't get the higher wisdom of discernment of principles. So
they're incomplete in that respect. Suppose, Nandaka, there was a
four-footed animal that was lame and disabled. It would be incomplete in
that respect. In the same way, a mendicant is faithful, ethical, and
gets internal serenity of heart, but they don't get the higher wisdom of
discernment of principles. So they're incomplete in that respect, and
should fulfill it, thinking, 'How can I become faithful and ethical and
get internal serenity of heart and get the higher wisdom of discernment
of principles?'

When a mendicant is faithful and ethical and gets internal serenity of
heart and gets the higher wisdom of discernment of principles, they're
complete in that respect."

That is what the Buddha said. When he had spoken, the Holy One got up
from his seat and entered his dwelling.

Then soon after the Buddha left, Venerable Nandaka said to the
mendicants, "Just now, reverends, the Buddha explained a spiritual
practice that's entirely full and pure in four statements, before
getting up from his seat and entering his dwelling:

'Nandaka, a mendicant is faithful but not ethical. So they're incomplete
in that respect, and should fulfill it, thinking, "How can I become
faithful and ethical?" When a mendicant is faithful and ethical, they're
complete in that respect.

A mendicant is faithful and ethical, but does not get internal serenity
of heart. ...

They get internal serenity of heart, but they don't get the higher
wisdom of discernment of principles. So they're incomplete in that
respect. Suppose, Nandaka, there was a four-footed animal that was lame
and disabled. It would be incomplete in that respect. In the same way, a
mendicant is faithful, ethical, and gets internal serenity of heart, but
they don't get the higher wisdom of discernment of principles. So
they're incomplete in that respect, and should fulfill it, thinking:
"How can I become faithful and ethical and get internal serenity of
heart and get the higher wisdom of discernment of principles?" When a
mendicant is faithful and ethical and gets internal serenity of heart
and gets the higher wisdom of discernment of principles, they're
complete in that respect.'

Reverends, there are these five benefits of listening to the teachings
at the right time and discussing the teachings at the right time. What
five?

Firstly, a mendicant proclaims a teaching to the mendicants that is good
in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful
and well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that's entirely
full and pure. Whenever they do this, they become liked and approved by
the Teacher, respected and admired. This is the first benefit ...

Furthermore, a mendicant teaches the mendicants the Dhamma ... Whenever
they do this, they feel inspired by the meaning and the teaching in that
Dhamma. This is the second benefit ...

Furthermore, a mendicant teaches the mendicants the Dhamma ... Whenever
they do this, they see the meaning of a deep saying in that Dhamma with
penetrating wisdom. This is the third benefit ...

Furthermore, a mendicant teaches the mendicants the Dhamma ... Whenever
they do this, their spiritual companions esteem them more highly,
thinking, 'For sure this venerable has attained or will attain.' This is
the fourth benefit ...

Furthermore, a mendicant teaches the mendicants the Dhamma ... Whenever
they do this, there may be trainee mendicants present, who haven't
achieved their heart's desire, but live aspiring to the supreme
sanctuary from the yoke. Hearing that teaching, they rouse energy for
attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the
unrealized. There may be perfected mendicants present, who have ended
the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be
done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the
fetter of continued existence, and are rightly freed through
enlightenment. Hearing that teaching, they simply live happily in this
life. This is the fifth benefit ...

These are the five benefits of listening to the teachings at the right
time and discussing the teachings at the right time."

<!--pg-->
### AN 9.5 Powers  *Balasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these four powers. What four? The powers of
wisdom, energy, blamelessness, and inclusiveness.

And what is the power of wisdom? One has clearly seen and clearly
contemplated with wisdom those qualities that are skillful and
considered to be skillful; those that are unskillful ... blameworthy ...
blameless ... dark ... bright ... to be cultivated ... not to be
cultivated ... not worthy of the noble ones ... worthy of the noble ones
and considered to be worthy of the noble ones. This is called the power
of wisdom.

And what is the power of energy? One generates enthusiasm, tries, makes
an effort, exerts the mind, and strives to give up those qualities that
are unskillful and considered to be unskillful; those that are
blameworthy ... dark ... not to be cultivated ... not worthy of the
noble ones and considered to be not worthy of the noble ones. One
generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and
strives to gain those qualities that are skillful and considered to be
skillful; those that are blameless ... bright ... to be cultivated ...
worthy of the noble ones and considered to be worthy of the noble ones.
This is called the power of energy.

And what is the power of blamelessness? It's when a noble disciple has
blameless conduct by way of body, speech, and mind. This is called the
power of blamelessness.

And what is the power of inclusiveness? There are these four ways of
being inclusive. Giving, kindly words, taking care, and equality. The
best of gifts is the gift of the teaching. The best sort of kindly
speech is to teach the Dhamma again and again to someone who is engaged
and who actively listens. The best way of taking care is to encourage,
settle, and ground the unfaithful in faith, the unethical in ethics, the
stingy in generosity, and the ignorant in wisdom. The best kind of
equality is the equality of a stream-enterer with another
stream-enterer, a once-returner with another once-returner, a
non-returner with another non-returner, and a perfected one with another
perfected one. This is called the power of inclusiveness. These are the
four powers.

A noble disciple who has these four powers has got past five fears. What
five? Fear regarding livelihood, disrepute, feeling insecure in an
assembly, death, and bad rebirth.

Then that noble disciple reflects: 'I have no fear regarding livelihood.
Why would I be afraid of that? I have these four powers: the powers of
wisdom, energy, blamelessness, and inclusiveness. A witless person might
fear for their livelihood. A lazy person might fear for their
livelihood. A person who does blameworthy things by way of body, speech,
and mind might fear for their livelihood. A person who does not include
others might fear for their livelihood. I have no fear of disrepute ...
I have no fear about feeling insecure in an assembly ... I have no fear
of death ... I have no fear of a bad rebirth. Why would I be afraid of
that? I have these four powers: the powers of wisdom, energy,
blamelessness, and inclusiveness. A witless person might be afraid of a
bad rebirth. A lazy person might be afraid of a bad rebirth. A person
who does blameworthy things by way of body, speech, and mind might be
afraid of a bad rebirth. A person who does not include others might be
afraid of a bad rebirth.'

A noble disciple who has these four powers has got past these five
fears."

<!--pg-->
### AN 9.6 Association  *Sevanāsutta*

There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants:

"Reverends, you should distinguish two kinds of people: those you should
associate with, and those you shouldn't associate with. You should
distinguish two kinds of robes: those you should wear, and those you
shouldn't wear. You should distinguish two kinds of almsfood: that which
you should eat, and that which you shouldn't eat. You should distinguish
two kinds of lodging: those you should frequent, and those you shouldn't
frequent. You should distinguish two kinds of village or town: those you
should frequent, and those you shouldn't frequent. You should
distinguish two kinds of country: those you should frequent, and those
you shouldn't frequent.

You should distinguish two kinds of people: those you should associate
with, and those you shouldn't associate with.' That's what I said, but
why did I say it? Well, should you know of a person: 'When I associate
with this person, unskillful qualities grow, and skillful qualities
decline. And the necessities of life that a renunciate requires---robes,
almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick---are hard
to come by. And the goal of the ascetic life for which I went forth from
the lay life to homelessness is not being fully developed.' In this case
you should leave that person at that very time of the day or night,
without asking. You shouldn't follow them.

Whereas, should you know of a person: 'When I associate with this
person, unskillful qualities grow, and skillful qualities decline. But
the necessities of life that a renunciate requires---robes, almsfood,
lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick---are easy to come by.
However, the goal of the ascetic life for which I went forth from the
lay life to homelessness is not being fully developed.' In this case you

qualities grow.' You should eat that kind of almsfood. 'You should
distinguish two kinds of almsfood: that which you should eat, and that

it? Well, should you know of a lodging: 'When I frequent this lodging,
unskillful qualities grow, and skillful qualities decline.' You should
not frequent that kind of lodging. Whereas, should you know of a
lodging: 'When I frequent this lodging, unskillful qualities decline,
and skillful qualities grow.' You should frequent that kind of lodging.

did I say it? Well, should you know of a village or town: 'When I

qualities decline.' You should not frequent that kind of village or
town. Whereas, should you know of a village or town: 'When I frequent
this village or town, unskillful qualities decline, and skillful
qualities grow.' You should frequent that kind of village or town. 'You

### AN 9.7 With Sutavā the Wanderer  *Sutavāsutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the
Vulture's Peak Mountain. Then the wanderer Sutavā went up
to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and
polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the
Buddha:

"Sir, this one time the Buddha was staying right here in
Rājagaha, the Mountainfold. There I heard and learned this
in the presence of the Buddha: 'A mendicant who is perfected---with
defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what
had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal,
utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed
through enlightenment---can't transgress in five respects. A mendicant
with defilements ended can't deliberately take the life of a living
creature, take something with the intention to steal, have sex, tell a
deliberate lie, or store up goods for their own enjoyment like they did
as a lay person.' I trust I properly heard, learned, applied the mind,
and remembered that from the Buddha?"

"Indeed, Sutavā, you properly heard, learned, applied the
mind, and remembered that. In the past, as today, I say this: 'A
mendicant who is perfected---with defilements ended, who has completed
the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden,
achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued
existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment---can't transgress
in nine respects. A mendicant with defilements ended can't deliberately
take the life of a living creature, take something with the intention to
steal, have sex, tell a deliberate lie, or store up goods for their own
enjoyment like they did as a lay person. And they can't make decisions
prejudiced by favoritism, hostility, stupidity, or cowardice.' In the
past, as today, I say this: 'A mendicant who is perfected---with
defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what
had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal,
utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed
through enlightenment---can't transgress in these nine respects.'"

### AN 9.8 With the Wanderer Sajjha  *Sajjhasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the
Vulture's Peak Mountain. Then the wanderer Sajjha went up to the Buddha,
and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite
conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:

"Sir, this one time the Buddha was staying right here in
Rājagaha, the Mountainfold. There I heard and learned this
in the presence of the Buddha: 'A mendicant who is perfected---with
defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what
had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal,
utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed
through enlightenment---can't transgress in five respects. A mendicant
with defilements ended can't deliberately take the life of a living
creature, take something with the intention to steal, have sex, tell a
deliberate lie, or store up goods for their own enjoyment like they did
as a lay person.' I trust I properly heard, learned, applied the mind,
and remembered that from the Buddha?"

"Indeed, Sajjha, you properly heard, learned, applied the mind, and
remembered that. In the past, as today, I say this: 'A mendicant who is
perfected---with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual
journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their
own true goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is
rightly freed through enlightenment---can't transgress in nine respects.
A mendicant with defilements ended can't deliberately kill a living
creature, take something with the intention to steal, have sex, tell a
deliberate lie, or store up goods for their own enjoyment like they used
to as a lay person. And they can't abandon the Buddha, the teaching, the
Saṅgha, or the training.' In the past, as today, I say
this: 'A mendicant who is perfected---with defilements ended, who has
completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the
burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetter of
continued existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment---can't
transgress in these nine respects.'"

### AN 9.9 Persons  *Puggalasutta*

"Mendicants, these nine people are found in the world. What nine? The
perfected one and the one practicing for perfection. The non-returner
and the one practicing to realize the fruit of non-return. The
once-returner and the one practicing to realize the fruit of
once-return. The stream-enterer and the one practicing to realize the
fruit of stream-entry. And the ordinary person. These are the nine
people found in the world."

### AN 9.10 Worthy of Offerings Dedicated to the Gods  *Āhuneyyasutta*

"Mendicants, these nine people are worthy of offerings dedicated to the
gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of
greeting with joined palms, and are the supreme field of merit for the
world. What nine? The perfected one and the one practicing for
perfection. The non-returner and the one practicing to realize the fruit
of non-return. The once-returner and the one practicing to realize the
fruit of once-return. The stream-enterer and the one practicing to
realize the fruit of stream-entry. And a lamb of the flock. These are
the nine people who are worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods,
worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of
greeting with joined palms, and are the supreme field of merit for the
world."

## The Chapter on the Lion's Roar

### AN 9.11 Sāriputta's Lion's Roar  *Sīhanādasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

Then Venerable Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat
down to one side, and said to him, "Sir, I have completed the rainy
season residence at Sāvatthī. I wish to depart to wander
the countryside."

"Please, Sāriputta, go at your convenience." Then
Sāriputta got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully
circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.

And then, not long after Sāriputta had left, a certain monk
said to the Buddha, "Sir, Venerable Sāriputta attacked me
and left without saying sorry."

So the Buddha addressed one of the monks, "Please, monk, in my name tell
Sāriputta that the teacher summons him."

"Yes, sir," that monk replied. He went to Sāriputta and
said to him, "Reverend Sāriputta, the teacher summons you."

"Yes, reverend," Sāriputta replied.

Now at that time the Venerables Mahāmoggallāna and Ānanda,
taking a latchkey, went from dwelling to dwelling, saying: "Come forth,
venerables! Come forth, venerables! Now Venerable Sāriputta
will roar his lion's roar in the presence of the Buddha!"

Then Venerable Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, and
sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:

"Sāriputta, one of your spiritual companions has made this
complaint: 'Venerable Sāriputta attacked me and left
without saying sorry.'"

"Sir, someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well
attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry.

Suppose they were to toss both clean and unclean things on the earth,
like feces, urine, spit, pus, and blood. The earth isn't horrified,
repelled, and disgusted because of this. In the same way, I live with a
heart like the earth, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and
ill will. Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might
well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying
sorry.

Suppose they were to wash both clean and unclean things in water, like
feces, urine, spit, pus, and blood. The water isn't horrified, repelled,
and disgusted because of this. In the same way, I live with a heart like
water, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well
attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry.

Suppose a fire were to burn both clean and unclean things, like feces,
urine, spit, pus, and blood. The fire isn't horrified, repelled, and
disgusted because of this. In the same way, I live with a heart like
fire, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well
attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry.

Suppose the wind was to blow on both clean and unclean things, like
feces, urine, spit, pus, and blood. The wind isn't horrified, repelled,
and disgusted because of this. In the same way, I live with a heart like
the wind, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well
attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry.

Suppose a rag was to wipe up both clean and unclean things, like feces,
urine, spit, pus, and blood. The rag isn't horrified, repelled, and
disgusted because of this. In the same way, I live with a heart like a
rag, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well
attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry.

Suppose a boy or girl of a corpse-worker tribe, holding a pot and clad
in rags, were to enter a town or village. They'd enter with a humble
mind. In the same way, I live with a heart like a boy or girl of a
corpse-worker tribe, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and
ill will. Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might
well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying
sorry.

Suppose there was a bull with his horns cut, gentle, well tamed and well
trained. He'd wander from street to street and square to square without
hurting anyone with his feet or horns. In the same way, I live with a
heart like a bull with horns cut, abundant, expansive, limitless, free
of enmity and ill will. Someone who had not established mindfulness of
the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave
without saying sorry.

Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of
adornments, and had bathed their head. If the carcass of a snake or a
dog or a human were hung around their neck, they'd be horrified,
repelled, and disgusted. In the same way, I'm horrified, repelled, and
disgusted by this rotten body. Someone who had not established
mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual
companions and leave without saying sorry.

Suppose someone was to carry around a bowl of fat that was leaking and
oozing from holes and cracks. In the same way, I carry around this body
that's leaking and oozing from holes and cracks. Someone who had not
established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their
spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry."

Then that monk rose from his seat, placed his robe over one shoulder,
bowed with his head at the Buddha's feet, and said, "I have made a
mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to speak ill
of Venerable Sāriputta with an incorrect, hollow, false,
untruthful claim. Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I
will restrain myself in future."

"Indeed, monk, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and
unskillful of you to act in that way. But since you have recognized your
mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it.
For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake
for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the
future."

Then the Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta,
"Sāriputta, forgive that futile man before his head
explodes into seven pieces right here."

"I will pardon that venerable if he asks me: 'May the venerable please
pardon me too.'"

<!--pg-->
### AN 9.12 With Residue  *Saupādisesasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and,
taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. Then
it occurred to him, "It's too early to wander for alms in
Sāvatthī. Why don't I visit the monastery of the wanderers
of other religions?" Then he went to the monastery of the wanderers of
other religions and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. When
the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one
side.

Now at that time while those wanderers of other religions were sitting
together this discussion came up among them:

"Reverends, no-one who dies with residue is exempt from hell, the animal
realm, or the ghost realm. They're not exempt from places of loss, bad
places, the underworld."

Sāriputta neither approved nor dismissed that statement of
the wanderers of other religions. He got up from his seat, thinking, "I
will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself."

Then Sāriputta wandered for alms in Sāvatthī.
After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha,
bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.

"Sāriputta, these foolish, incompetent wanderers following
other religions: who are they to know whether someone has residue or
not?

There are these nine people who, dying with residue, are exempt from
hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They're exempt from places
of loss, bad places, the underworld. What nine?

There's a person who has fulfilled ethics and immersion, but has limited
wisdom. With the ending of the five lower fetters they're extinguished
between one life and the next. This is the first person ...

Furthermore, there's a person who has fulfilled ethics and immersion,
but has limited wisdom. With the ending of the five lower fetters
they're extinguished upon landing. This is the second person ...

With the ending of the five lower fetters they're extinguished without
extra effort. This is the third person ...

With the ending of the five lower fetters they're extinguished with
extra effort. This is the fourth person ...

With the ending of the five lower fetters they head upstream, going to
the Akaniṭṭha realm. This is the fifth person ...

Furthermore, there's a person who has fulfilled ethics, but has limited
immersion and wisdom. With the ending of three fetters, and the
weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, they're a once-returner. They
come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. This
is the sixth person ...

Furthermore, there's a person who has fulfilled ethics, but has limited
immersion and wisdom. With the ending of three fetters, they're a
one-seeder. They will be reborn just one time in a human existence, then
make an end of suffering. This is the seventh person ...

Furthermore, there's a person who has fulfilled ethics, but has limited
immersion and wisdom. With the ending of three fetters, they go from
family to family. They will transmigrate between two or three families
and then make an end of suffering. This is the eighth person ...

Furthermore, there's a person who has fulfilled ethics, but has limited
immersion and wisdom. With the ending of three fetters, they have at
most seven rebirths. They will transmigrate at most seven times among
gods and humans and then make an end of suffering. This is the ninth
person ...

These foolish, incompetent wanderers following other religions: who are
they to know whether someone has residue or not? These are the nine
people who, dying with residue, are exempt from hell, the animal realm,
and the ghost realm. They're exempt from places of loss, bad places, the
underworld.

Up until now, Sāriputta, I have not felt the need to give
this exposition of the teaching to the monks, nuns, laymen, and
laywomen. Why is that? For I didn't want those who heard it to introduce
negligence. However, I have spoken it in order to answer your question."

<!--pg-->
### AN 9.13 With Koṭṭhita  *Koṭṭhikasutta*

Then Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita went up to Venerable
Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him. When the
greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and
said to Sāriputta:

"Reverend Sāriputta, is the spiritual life lived under the
Buddha for this purpose: 'May deeds to be experienced in this life be
experienced by me in lives to come'?"

"Certainly not, reverend."

"Then is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose:
'May deeds to be experienced in lives to come be experienced by me in
this life'?"

"Certainly not."

"Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose: 'May
deeds to be experienced as pleasant be experienced by me as painful'?"

"Certainly not."

"Then is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose:
'May deeds to be experienced as painful be experienced by me as
pleasant'?"

"Certainly not."

"Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose: 'May
deeds to be experienced when ripe be experienced by me when unripe'?"

"Certainly not."

"Then is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose:
'May deeds to be experienced when unripe be experienced by me when
ripe'?"

"Certainly not."

"Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose: 'May
deeds to be experienced a lot be experienced by me a little'?"

"Certainly not."

"Then is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose:
'May deeds to be experienced a little be experienced by me a lot'?"

"Certainly not."

"Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose: 'May
deeds to be experienced by me be not experienced'?"

"Certainly not."

"Then is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose:
'May deeds not to be experienced be experienced'?"

"Certainly not."

"Reverend Sāriputta, when you were asked whether the
spiritual life was lived under the Buddha so that deeds to be
experienced in this life are experienced in lives to come, you said,
'Certainly not'.

When you were asked whether the spiritual life was lived under the
Buddha so that deeds to be experienced in lives to come are experienced
in this life ...

deeds to be experienced as pleasant are experienced as painful ...

deeds to be experienced as painful are experienced as pleasant ...

deeds to be experienced when ripe are experienced when unripe ...

deeds to be experienced when unripe are experienced when ripe ...

deeds to be experienced a lot are experienced a little ...

deeds to be experienced a little are experienced a lot ...

deeds to be experienced are not experienced ...

When you were asked whether the spiritual life was lived under the
Buddha so that deeds not to be experienced are experienced, you said,
'Certainly not.' Then what exactly is the purpose of leading the
spiritual life under the Buddha?"

"Reverend, the spiritual life is lived under the Buddha to know, see,
attain, realize, and comprehend that which is unknown, unseen,
unattained, unrealized, and uncomprehended."

"But what is the unknown, unseen, unattained, unrealized, and
uncomprehended?"

"'This is suffering.' ... 'This is the origin of suffering.' ... 'This
is the cessation of suffering.' ... 'This is the practice that leads to
the cessation of suffering.' ... This is the unknown, unseen,
unattained, unrealized, and uncomprehended. The spiritual life is lived
under the Buddha to know, see, attain, realize, and comprehend this."

<!--pg-->
### AN 9.14 With Samiddhi  *Samiddhisutta*

Then Venerable Samiddhi went up to Venerable Sāriputta,
bowed, and sat to one side. Venerable Sāriputta said to
him:

"Samiddhi, based on what do thoughts arise in a person?"

"Based on name and form, sir."

"Where do they become diversified?"

"In the elements."

"What is their origin?"

"Contact is their origin."

"What is their meeting place?"

"Feeling is their meeting place."

"What is their chief?"

"Immersion is their chief."

"What is their ruler?"

"Mindfulness is their ruler."

"What is their overseer?"

"Wisdom is their overseer."

"What is their core?"

"Freedom is their core."

"What is their culmination?"

"They culminate in freedom from death."

"Samiddhi, when you were asked what is the basis on which thoughts arise
in a person, you answered 'name and form'. When you were asked ... what
is their culmination, you answered 'freedom from death'. Good, good,
Samiddhi! It's good that you answered each question. But don't get
conceited because of that."

### AN 9.15 The Simile of the Boil  *Gaṇḍasutta*

"Mendicants, suppose there was a boil that was many years old. And that
boil had nine orifices that were continually open wounds. Whatever oozed
out of them would be filthy, stinking, and disgusting. Whatever leaked
out them would be filthy, stinking, and disgusting.

'Boil' is a term for this body made up of the four principal states,
produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable
to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and
destruction. And that boil has nine orifices that are continually open
wounds. Whatever oozes out of them is filthy, stinking, and disgusting.
Whatever leaks out of them is filthy, stinking, and disgusting. So,
mendicants, have no illusion about this body."

<!--pg-->
### AN 9.16 Perceptions  *Saññāsutta*

"Mendicants, these nine perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are
very fruitful and beneficial. They culminate in freedom from death and
end in freedom from death. What nine? The perceptions of ugliness,
death, repulsiveness of food, dissatisfaction with the whole world,
impermanence, suffering in impermanence, not-self in suffering, giving
up, and fading away. These nine perceptions, when developed and
cultivated, are very fruitful and beneficial. They culminate in freedom
from death and end in freedom from death."

<!--pg-->
### AN 9.17 Families  *Kulasutta*

"Mendicants, visiting a family with nine factors is not worthwhile, or
if you've already arrived, sitting down is not worthwhile. What nine?
They don't politely rise, bow, or offer a seat. They hide what they
have. Even when they have much they give little. Even when they have
fine things they give coarse things. They give carelessly, not
carefully. They don't sit nearby to listen to the teachings. When you're
speaking, they don't listen well. Visiting a family with these nine
factors is not worthwhile, or if you've already arrived, sitting down is
not worthwhile.

Visiting a family with nine factors is worthwhile, or if you've already
arrived, sitting down is worthwhile. What nine? They politely rise, bow,
and offer a seat. They don't hide what they have. When they have much
they give much. When they have refined things they give refined things.
They give carefully, not carelessly. They sit nearby to listen to the
teachings. When you're speaking, they listen well. Visiting a family
with these nine factors is worthwhile, or if you've already arrived,
sitting down is worthwhile."

<!--pg-->
### AN 9.18 The Sabbath with Nine Factors  *Navaṅguposathasutta*

"Mendicants, the observance of the sabbath with its nine factors is very
fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful. And how should it be
observed?

It's when a noble disciple reflects: 'As long as they live, the
perfected ones give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and
the sword. They are scrupulous and kind, and live full of sympathy for
all living beings. I, too, for this day and night will give up killing
living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. I'll be scrupulous
and kind, and live full of sympathy for all living beings. I will
observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.'
This is its first factor. ...

'As long as they live, the perfected ones give up high and luxurious
beds. They sleep in a low place, either a small bed or a straw mat. I,
too, for this day and night will give up high and luxurious beds. I'll
sleep in a low place, either a small bed or a straw mat. I will observe
the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.' This is
its eighth factor.

They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to
the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above,
below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love
to the whole world---abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and
ill will. This is its ninth factor.

The observance of the sabbath with its nine factors in this way is very
fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful."

<!--pg-->
### AN 9.19 A Deity  *Devatāsutta*

"Mendicants, tonight, several glorious deities, lighting up the entire
Jeta's Grove, came to me, bowed, stood to one side, and said to me:
'Sir, formerly when we were human beings, renunciates came to our homes.
We politely rose for them, but we didn't bow. And so, having not
fulfilled our duty, full of remorse and regret, we were reborn in a
lesser realm.'

Then several other deities came to me and said: 'Sir, formerly when we
were human beings, renunciates came to our homes. We politely rose for
them and bowed, but we didn't offer a seat. And so, having not fulfilled
our duty, full of remorse and regret, we were reborn in a lesser realm.'

Then several other deities came to me and said: 'Sir, formerly when we
were human beings, renunciates came to our homes. We politely rose for
them, bowed, and offered a seat, but we didn't share as best we could.
...'

'... we didn't sit nearby to listen to the teachings. ...'

'... we didn't actively listen to the teachings. ...'

'... we didn't memorize the teachings. ...'

'... we didn't examine the meaning of teachings we'd memorized. ...'

'... not having understood the meaning and the teaching, we didn't
practice accordingly. And so, having not fulfilled our duty, full of
remorse and regret, we were reborn in a lesser realm.'

Then several other deities came to me and said: 'Sir, formerly when we
were human beings, renunciates came to our homes. We politely rose,
bowed, and offered them a seat. We shared as best we could. We sat
nearby to listen to the teachings, lent an ear, memorized them, and
examined their meaning. Understanding the teaching and the meaning we
practiced accordingly. And so, having fulfilled our duty, free of
remorse and regret, we were reborn in a superior realm.'

Here, mendicants, are these roots of trees, and here are these empty
huts. Practice absorption, mendicants! Don't be negligent! Don't regret
it later, like those former deities."

### AN 9.20 About Velāma  *Velāmasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Then the householder
Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to
one side. The Buddha said to him, "Householder, I wonder whether your
family gives gifts?"

"It does, sir. But only coarse gruel with pickles."

"Householder, someone might give a gift that's either coarse or fine.
But they give it carelessly, thoughtlessly, not with their own hand.
They give the dregs, and they give without consideration for
consequences. Then wherever the result of any such gift manifests, their
mind doesn't incline toward enjoyment of nice food, clothes, vehicles,
or the five refined kinds of sensual stimulation. And their children,
wives, bondservants, servants, and workers don't want to listen to them.
They don't actively listen or try to understand. Why is that? Because
that is the result of deeds done carelessly.

Someone might give a gift that's either coarse or fine. And they give it
carefully, thoughtfully, with their own hand. They don't give the dregs,
and they give with consideration for consequences. Then wherever the
result of any such gift manifests, their mind inclines toward enjoyment
of nice food, clothes, vehicles, or the five refined kinds of sensual
stimulation. And their children, wives, bondservants, servants, and
workers want to listen. They actively listen and try to understand. Why
is that? Because that is the result of deeds done carefully.

Once upon a time, householder, there was a brahmin named
Velāma. He gave the following gift, a great offering.
84,000 gold cups filled with silver. 84,000 silver cups filled with
gold. 84,000 bronze cups filled with gold coins. 84,000 elephants with
gold adornments and banners, covered with snow gold netting. 84,000
chariots upholstered with the hide of lions, tigers, and leopards, and
cream rugs, with gold adornments and banners, covered with snow gold
netting. 84,000 milk cows with silken reins and bronze pails. 84,000
maidens bedecked with jeweled earrings. 84,000 couches spread with
woolen covers---shag-piled, pure white, or embroidered with
flowers---and spread with a fine deer hide, with canopies above and red
pillows at both ends. 8,400,000,000 fine cloths of linen, cotton, silk,
and wool. And who can say how much food, drink, snacks, meals,
refreshments, and beverages? It seemed like an overflowing river.

Householder, you might think: 'Surely the brahmin Velāma
must have been someone else at that time?' But you should not see it
like this. I myself was the brahmin Velāma at that time. I
gave that gift, a great offering. But at that event there was no-one
worthy of a religious donation, and no-one to purify the religious
donation.

It would be more fruitful to feed one person accomplished in view than
that great offering of Velāma.

It would be more fruitful to feed one once-returner than a hundred
persons accomplished in view.

It would be more fruitful to feed one non-returner than a hundred
once-returners.

It would be more fruitful to feed one perfected one than a hundred
non-returners.

It would be more fruitful to feed one Independent Buddha than a hundred
perfected ones.

It would be more fruitful to feed one Realized One, a perfected one, a
fully awakened Buddha than a hundred Independent Buddhas.

It would be more fruitful to feed the mendicant Saṅgha
headed by the Buddha than to feed one Realized One, a perfected one, a
fully awakened Buddha.

It would be more fruitful to build a dwelling especially for the
Saṅgha of the four quarters than to feed the mendicant
Saṅgha headed by the Buddha.

It would be more fruitful to go for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching,
and the Saṅgha with a confident heart than to build a
dwelling for the Saṅgha of the four quarters.

It would be more fruitful to undertake the training rules---not to kill
living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or consume beer,
wine, and liquor intoxicants---than to go for refuge to the Buddha, the
teaching, and the Saṅgha with a confident heart.

It would be more fruitful to develop a heart of love---even just as long
as it takes to pull a cow's udder---than to undertake the training
rules.

It would be more fruitful to develop the perception of
impermanence---even for as long as a finger-snap---than to do all of
these things, including developing a heart of love for as long as it
takes to pull a cow's udder."

and the gods of the thirty-three in three particulars. What three?
Bravery, mindfulness, and the spiritual life is lived here. The humans
of the Black Plum Tree Land surpass the humans of Uttarakuru and the
gods of the thirty-three in these three particulars."

### AN 9.22 A Wild Colt  *Assakhaḷuṅkasutta*

"Mendicants, I will teach you about three wild colts and three wild
people; three excellent horses and three excellent people; and three
fine thoroughbred horses and three fine thoroughbred people. Listen and
apply your mind well, I will speak.

And what are the three wild colts? One wild colt is fast, but not
beautiful or well proportioned. Another wild colt is fast and beautiful,
but not well proportioned. While another wild colt is fast, beautiful,
and well proportioned. These are the three wild colts.

And what are the three wild people? One wild person is fast, but not
beautiful or well proportioned. Another wild person is fast and
beautiful, but not well proportioned. While another wild person is fast,
beautiful, and well proportioned.

And how is a wild person fast, but not beautiful or well proportioned?
It's when a mendicant truly understands: 'This is suffering' ... 'This
is the origin of suffering' ... 'This is the cessation of suffering' ...
'This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering'. This is
how they're fast, I say. But when asked a question about the teaching or
training, they falter without answering. This is how they're not
beautiful, I say. And they don't receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and
medicines and supplies for the sick. This is how they're not well
proportioned, I say. This is how a wild person is fast, but not
beautiful or well proportioned.

And how is a wild person fast and beautiful, but not well proportioned?
They truly understand: 'This is suffering' ... 'This is the origin of
suffering' ... 'This is the cessation of suffering' ... 'This is the
practice that leads to the cessation of suffering'. This is how they're
fast, I say. When asked a question about the teaching or training, they
answer without faltering. This is how they're beautiful, I say. But they
don't receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for
the sick. This is how they're not well proportioned, I say. This is how
a wild person is fast and beautiful, but not well proportioned.

And how is a wild person fast, beautiful, and well proportioned? They
truly understand: 'This is suffering' ... 'This is the origin of
suffering' ... 'This is the cessation of suffering' ... 'This is the
practice that leads to the cessation of suffering'. This is how they're
fast, I say. When asked a question about the teaching or training, they
answer without faltering. This is how they're beautiful, I say. They
receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the
sick. This is how they're well proportioned, I say. This is how a wild
person is fast, beautiful, and well proportioned. These are the three
wild people.

And what are the three excellent horses? One excellent horse ... is
fast, beautiful, and well proportioned. These are the three excellent
horses.

What are the three excellent people? One excellent person ... is fast,
beautiful, and well proportioned.

And how is an excellent person ... fast, beautiful, and well
proportioned? It's when a mendicant, with the ending of the five lower
fetters, is reborn spontaneously. They're extinguished there, and are
not liable to return from that world. This is how they're fast, I say.
When asked a question about the teaching or training, they answer
without faltering. This is how they're beautiful, I say. They receive
robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. This
is how they're well proportioned, I say. This is how an excellent person
is fast, beautiful, and well proportioned. These are the three excellent
people.

And what are the three fine thoroughbred horses? One fine thoroughbred
horse ... is fast, beautiful, and well proportioned. These are the three
fine thoroughbred horses.

And what are the three fine thoroughbred people? One fine thoroughbred
person ... is fast, beautiful, and well proportioned.

And how is a fine thoroughbred person ... fast, beautiful, and well
proportioned? It's a mendicant who realizes the undefiled freedom of
heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having
realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
This is how they're fast, I say. When asked a question about the
teaching or training, they answer without faltering. This is how they're
beautiful, I say. They receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines
and supplies for the sick. This is how they're well proportioned, I say.
This is how a fine thoroughbred person is fast, beautiful, and well
proportioned. These are the three fine thoroughbred people."

### AN 9.23 Rooted in Craving  *Taṇhāmūlakasutta*

"Mendicants, I will teach you about nine things rooted in craving. And
what are the nine things rooted in craving? Craving is a cause of
seeking. Seeking is a cause of gaining material things. Gaining material
things is a cause of evaluation. Evaluation is a cause of desire and
lust. Desire and lust is a cause of attachment. Attachment is a cause of
ownership. Ownership is a cause of stinginess. Stinginess is a cause of
safeguarding. Owing to safeguarding, many bad, unskillful things come to
be: taking up the rod and the sword, quarrels, arguments, and fights,
accusations, divisive speech, and lies. These are the nine things rooted
in craving."

<!--pg-->
### AN 9.24 Abodes of Sentient Beings  *Sattāvāsasutta*

"Mendicants, there are nine abodes of sentient beings. What nine?

There are sentient beings that are diverse in body and diverse in
perception, such as human beings, some gods, and some beings in the
underworld. This is the first abode of sentient beings.

There are sentient beings that are diverse in body and unified in
perception, such as the gods reborn in the Divinity's host through the
first absorption. This is the second abode of sentient beings.

There are sentient beings that are unified in body and diverse in
perception, such as the gods of streaming radiance. This is the third
abode of sentient beings.

There are sentient beings that are unified in body and unified in
perception, such as the gods of universal beauty. This is the fourth
abode of sentient beings.

There are sentient beings that are non-percipient and do not experience
anything, such as the gods who are non-percipient beings. This is the
fifth abode of sentient beings.

There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond perceptions of
form. With the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on
perceptions of diversity, aware that 'space is infinite', they have been
reborn in the dimension of infinite space. This is the sixth abode of
sentient beings.

There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond the dimension of
infinite space. Aware that 'consciousness is infinite', they have been
reborn in the dimension of infinite consciousness. This is the seventh
abode of sentient beings.

There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond the dimension of
infinite consciousness. Aware that 'there is nothing at all', they have
been reborn in the dimension of nothingness. This is the eighth abode of
sentient beings.

There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond the dimension of
nothingness. They have been reborn in the dimension of neither
perception nor non-perception. This is the ninth abode of sentient
beings.

These are the nine abodes of sentient beings."

### AN 9.25 Consolidated by Wisdom  *Paññāsutta*

"Mendicants, when a mendicant's mind has been well consolidated with
wisdom it's appropriate for them to say: 'I understand: "Rebirth is
ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has
been done, there is nothing further for this place."'

And how is a mendicant's mind well consolidated with wisdom? The mind is
well consolidated with wisdom when they know: 'My mind is without
greed.' ... 'My mind is without hate.' ... 'My mind is without
delusion.' ... 'My mind is not liable to become greedy.' ... 'My mind is
not liable to become hateful.' ... 'My mind is not liable to become
deluded.' ... 'My mind is not liable to return to rebirth in the sensual
realm.' ... 'My mind is not liable to return to rebirth in the realm of
luminous form.' ... 'My mind is not liable to return to rebirth in the
formless realm.' When a mendicant's mind has been well consolidated with
wisdom it's appropriate for them to say: 'I understand: "Rebirth is
ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has
been done, there is nothing further for this place."'"

<!--pg-->
### AN 9.26 The Simile of the Stone Pillar  *Silāyūpasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding
ground.

There Venerable Candikāputta addressed the mendicants,
"Reverends, Devadatta teaches the mendicants like this: 'When a
mendicant's mind is solidified by heart, it's appropriate for them to
say: "I understand: 'Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been
completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further
for this place.'"'"

When he said this, Venerable Sāriputta said to him,
"Reverend Candikāputta, Devadatta does not teach the
mendicants like that. He teaches like this: 'When a mendicant's mind is
well consolidated by heart, it's appropriate for them to say: "I
understand: 'Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed,
what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this
place.'"'"

For a second time ...

And for a third time Venerable Candikāputta addressed the
mendicants ...

And for a third time, Sāriputta said to him, "Reverend
Candikāputta, Devadatta does not teach the mendicants like
that. He teaches like this: 'When a mendicant's mind is well
consolidated by heart, it's appropriate for them to say: "I understand:
'Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to
be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.'"'

And how is a mendicant's mind well consolidated by heart? The mind is
well consolidated by heart when they know: 'My mind is without greed.'
... 'My mind is without hate.' ... 'My mind is without delusion.' ...
'My mind is not liable to become greedy.' ... 'My mind is not liable to
become hateful.' ... 'My mind is not liable to become deluded.' ... 'My
mind is not liable to return to rebirth in the sensual realm.' ... 'My
mind is not liable to return to rebirth in the realm of luminous form.'
... 'My mind is not liable to return to rebirth in the formless realm.'

When a mendicant's mind is rightly freed like this, even if compelling
sights come into the range of vision they don't occupy their mind. The
mind remains untainted. It is steady, imperturbable, observing
disappearance.

Suppose there was a stone pillar, sixteen feet long. Eight feet were
buried underground, and eight above ground. And violent storms were to
blow up out of the east, the west, the north, and the south. They
couldn't make it tremor and tremble and quake. Why is that? It's because
that stone pillar is firmly embedded, with deep foundations. In the same
way, when a mendicant's mind is rightly freed like this, even if
compelling sights come into the range of vision they don't occupy their
mind. The mind remains untainted. It is steady, imperturbable, observing
disappearance.

If even compelling sounds ... smells ... tastes ... touches ... and
ideas come into the range of the mind they don't occupy the mind. The
mind remains untainted. It is steady, imperturbable, observing
disappearance."

### AN 9.27 Dangers and Threats (1st)  *Paṭhamaverasutta*

Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha,
bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:

"Householder, when a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and
threats, and has the four factors of stream-entry, they may, if they
wish, declare of themselves: 'I've finished with rebirth in hell, the
animal realm, and the ghost realm. I've finished with all places of
loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I'm not liable
to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.'

What are the five dangers and threats they have quelled? Anyone who
kills living creatures creates dangers and threats both in this life and
in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. Anyone who
refrains from killing living creatures creates no dangers and threats
either in this life or in lives to come, and doesn't experience mental
pain and sadness. So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who
refrains from killing living creatures.

Anyone who steals ...

Anyone who commits sexual misconduct ...

Anyone who lies ...

Anyone who consumes beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants creates dangers
and threats both in this life and in lives to come, and experiences
mental pain and sadness. Anyone who refrains from consuming beer, wine,
and liquor intoxicants creates no dangers and threats either in this
life or in lives to come, and doesn't experience mental pain and
sadness. So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains
from consuming beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants.

These are the five dangers and threats they have quelled.

What are the four factors of stream-entry that they have? It's when a
noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha: 'That Blessed
One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and
conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to
train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.'

They have experiential confidence in the teaching: 'The teaching is well
explained by the Buddha---apparent in the present life, immediately
effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can
know it for themselves.'

They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: 'The
Saṅgha of the Buddha's disciples is practicing the way
that's good, sincere, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four
pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the
Buddha's disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods,
worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of
greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the
world.'

And a noble disciple's ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones,
unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by
sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. These are the
four factors of stream-entry that they have.

When a noble disciple has quelled these five dangers and threats, and
has these four factors of stream-entry, they may, if they wish, declare
of themselves: 'I've finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm,
and the ghost realm. I've finished with all places of loss, bad places,
the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I'm not liable to be reborn in
the underworld, and am bound for awakening.'"

### AN 9.28 Dangers and Threats (2nd)  *Dutiyaverasutta*

"Mendicants, when a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats,
and has the four factors of stream-entry, they may, if they wish,
declare of themselves: 'I've finished with rebirth in hell, the animal
realm, and the ghost realm. I've finished with all places of loss, bad
places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I'm not liable to be

### AN 9.29 Grounds for Resentment  *Āghātavatthusutta*

"Mendicants, there are nine grounds for resentment. What nine? Thinking:
'They did wrong to me,' you harbor resentment. Thinking: 'They are doing
wrong to me' ... 'They will do wrong to me' ... 'They did wrong to
someone I love' ... 'They are doing wrong to someone I love' ... 'They
will do wrong to someone I love' ... 'They helped someone I dislike' ...
'They are helping someone I dislike' ... Thinking: 'They will help
someone I dislike,' you harbor resentment. These are the nine grounds
for resentment."

### AN 9.30 Getting Rid of Resentment  *Āghātapaṭivinayasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these nine methods to get rid of resentment. What
nine? Thinking: 'They harmed me, but what can I possibly do?' you get
rid of resentment. Thinking: 'They are harming me ...' ... 'They will
harm me ...' ... 'They harmed someone I love ...' ... 'They are harming
someone I love ...' 'They will harm someone I love ...' ... 'They helped
someone I dislike ...' ... 'They are helping someone I dislike ...' ...
Thinking: 'They will help someone I dislike, but what can I possibly
do?' you get rid of resentment. These are the nine methods to get rid of
resentment."

### AN 9.31 Progressive Cessations  *Anupubbanirodhasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these nine progressive cessations. What nine?

For someone who has attained the first absorption, sensual perceptions
have ceased.

For someone who has attained the second absorption, the placing of the
mind and keeping it connected have ceased.

For someone who has attained the third absorption, rapture has ceased.

For someone who has attained the fourth absorption, breathing has
ceased.

For someone who has attained the dimension of infinite space, the
perception of form has ceased.

For someone who has attained the dimension of infinite consciousness,
the perception of the dimension of infinite space has ceased.

For someone who has attained the dimension of nothingness, the
perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness has ceased.

For someone who has attained the dimension of neither perception nor
non-perception, the perception of the dimension of nothingness has
ceased.

For someone who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling,
perception and feeling have ceased.

These are the nine progressive cessations."

### AN 9.32 Progressive Meditations  *Anupubbavihārasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these nine progressive meditations. What nine?
The first absorption, the second absorption, the third absorption, the
fourth absorption, the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of
infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness, the dimension of
neither perception nor non-perception, and the cessation of perception
and feeling. These are the nine progressive meditations."

<!--pg-->
### AN 9.33 The Nine Progressive Meditative Attainments  *Anupubbavihārasamāpattisutta*

"Mendicants, I will teach you the nine progressive meditative
attainments ... And what are the nine progressive meditative
attainments?

Where sensual pleasures cease, and those who have thoroughly ended
sensual pleasures meditate, I say: 'Clearly those venerables are
desireless, quenched, crossed over, and gone beyond in that respect.' If
someone should say, 'I do not know or see where sensual pleasures
cease', they should be told: 'Reverend, it's when a mendicant, quite
secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities,
enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and
bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it
connected. That's where sensual pleasures cease.' Clearly someone who is
not devious or deceitful would approve and agree with that statement.
They'd say 'Good!' and bowing down, they'd pay homage with joined palms.

Where the placing of the mind and keeping it connected cease, and those
who have thoroughly ended the placing of the mind and keeping it
connected meditate, I say: 'Clearly those venerables are desireless,
quenched, crossed over, and gone beyond in that respect.' If someone
should say, 'I do not know or see where the placing of the mind and
keeping it connected cease', they should be told: 'It's when a
mendicant, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are
stilled, enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the
rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at
one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. That's where the
placing of the mind and keeping it connected cease.' Clearly someone who
is not devious or deceitful would approve and agree with that statement.
They'd say 'Good!' and bowing down, they'd pay homage with joined palms.

Where rapture ceases, and those who have thoroughly ended rapture
meditate, I say: 'Clearly those venerables are desireless, quenched,
crossed over, and gone beyond in that respect.' If someone should say,
'I do not know or see where rapture ceases', they should be told: 'It's
when a mendicant, with the fading away of rapture, enters and remains in
the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and
aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones
declare, "Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss". That's where
rapture ceases.' Clearly someone who is not devious or deceitful would
approve and agree with that statement. They'd say 'Good!' and bowing
down, they'd pay homage with joined palms.

Where bliss with equanimity ceases, and those who have thoroughly ended
bliss with equanimity meditate, I say: 'Clearly those venerables are
desireless, quenched, crossed over, and gone beyond in that respect.' If
someone should say, 'I do not know or see where bliss with equanimity
ceases', they should be told: 'It's when a mendicant, giving up pleasure
and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, enters and remains in
the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity
and mindfulness. That's where bliss with equanimity ceases.' Clearly
someone who is not devious or deceitful would approve and agree with
that statement. They'd say 'Good!' and bowing down, they'd pay homage
with joined palms.

Where perceptions of form ceases, and those who have thoroughly ended
perceptions of form meditate, I say: 'Clearly those venerables are
desireless, quenched, crossed over, and gone beyond in that respect.' If
someone should say, 'I do not know or see where perceptions of form
ceases', they should be told: 'It's when a mendicant, going totally
beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of
impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that "space
is infinite", enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.
That's where perceptions of form cease.' Clearly someone who is not
devious or deceitful would approve and agree with that statement. They'd
say 'Good!' and bowing down, they'd pay homage with joined palms.

Where the perception of the dimension of infinite space ceases, and
those who have thoroughly ended the perception of the dimension of
infinite space meditate, I say: 'Clearly those venerables are
desireless, quenched, crossed over, and gone beyond in that respect.' If
someone should say, 'I do not know or see where the perception of the
dimension of infinite space ceases', they should be told: 'It's when a
mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware
that "consciousness is infinite", enters and remains in the dimension of
infinite consciousness. That's where the perception of the dimension of
infinite space ceases.' Clearly someone who is not devious or deceitful
would approve and agree with that statement. They'd say 'Good!' and
bowing down, they'd pay homage with joined palms.

Where the perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness ceases,
and those who have thoroughly ended the perception of the dimension of
infinite consciousness meditate, I say: 'Clearly those venerables are
desireless, quenched, crossed over, and gone beyond in that respect.' If
someone should say, 'I do not know or see where the perception of the
dimension of infinite consciousness ceases', they should be told: 'It's
when a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite
consciousness, aware that "there is nothing at all", enters and remains
in the dimension of nothingness. That's where the perception of the
dimension of infinite consciousness ceases.' Clearly someone who is not
devious or deceitful would approve and agree with that statement. They'd
say 'Good!' and bowing down, they'd pay homage with joined palms.

Where the perception of the dimension of nothingness ceases, and those
who have thoroughly ended the perception of the dimension of nothingness
meditate, I say: 'Clearly those venerables are desireless, quenched,
crossed over, and gone beyond in that respect.' If someone should say,
'I do not know or see where the perception of the dimension of
nothingness ceases', they should be told: 'It's when a mendicant, going
totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, enters and remains in the
dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. That's where the
perception of the dimension of nothingness ceases.' Clearly someone who
is not devious or deceitful would approve and agree with that statement.
They'd say 'Good!' and bowing down, they'd pay homage with joined palms.

Where the perception of the dimension of neither perception nor
non-perception ceases, and those who have thoroughly ended the
perception of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception
meditate, I say: 'Clearly those venerables are desireless, quenched,
crossed over, and gone beyond in that respect.' If someone should say,

### AN 9.34 Extinguishment is Bliss  *Nibbānasukhasutta*

At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near
Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding
ground.

There he addressed the mendicants: "Reverends, extinguishment is bliss!
Extinguishment is bliss!"

When he said this, Venerable Udāyī said to him, "But
Reverend Sāriputta, what's blissful about it, since nothing
is felt?"

"The fact that nothing is felt is precisely what's blissful about it.

Reverend, there are these five kinds of sensual stimulation. What five?
Sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable,
pleasant, sensual, and arousing. Sounds known by the ear ... Smells
known by the nose ... Tastes known by the tongue ... Touches known by
the body, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual,
and arousing. These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation. The
pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual
stimulation is called sensual pleasure.

First, take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures ...
enters and remains in the first absorption. While a mendicant is
practicing such a meditation, if perception and focus accompanied by
sensual pleasures beset them, that's an affliction for them. Suppose a
happy person were to experience pain; that would be an affliction for
them. In the same way, should perception and focus accompanied by
sensual pleasures beset them, that's an affliction for them. And
affliction has been called suffering by the Buddha. That's the way to
understand how extinguishment is bliss.

Furthermore, take a mendicant who, as the placing of the mind and
keeping it connected are stilled, enters and remains in the second
absorption. While a mendicant is practicing such a meditation, if
perception and focus accompanied by placing of the mind beset them,
that's an affliction for them. Suppose a happy person were to experience
pain; that would be an affliction for them. In the same way, should
perception and focus accompanied by placing of the mind beset them,
that's an affliction for them. And affliction has been called suffering
by the Buddha. That too is a way to understand how extinguishment is
bliss.

Furthermore, take a mendicant who, with the fading away of rapture,
enters and remains in the third absorption. While a mendicant is
practicing such a meditation, if perception and focus accompanied by
rapture beset them, that's an affliction for them. Suppose a happy
person were to experience pain; that would be an affliction for them. In
the same way, should perception and focus accompanied by rapture beset
them, that's an affliction for them. And affliction has been called
suffering by the Buddha. That too is a way to understand how
extinguishment is bliss.

Furthermore, take a mendicant who, giving up pleasure and pain, and
ending former happiness and sadness, enters and remains in the fourth
absorption. While a mendicant is practicing such a meditation, if
perception and focus accompanied by bliss with equanimity beset them,
that's an affliction for them. Suppose a happy person were to experience
pain; that would be an affliction for them. In the same way, should
perception and focus accompanied by bliss with equanimity beset them,
that's an affliction for them. And affliction has been called suffering
by the Buddha. That too is a way to understand how extinguishment is
bliss.

Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond perceptions of
form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on
perceptions of diversity, aware that 'space is infinite', enters and
remains in the dimension of infinite space. While a mendicant is
practicing such a meditation, if perception and focus accompanied by
form beset them, that's an affliction for them. Suppose a happy person
were to experience pain; that would be an affliction for them. In the
same way, should perception and focus accompanied by form beset them,
that's an affliction for them. And affliction has been called suffering
by the Buddha. That too is a way to understand how extinguishment is
bliss.

Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of
infinite space, aware that 'consciousness is infinite', enters and
remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. While a mendicant is
practicing such a meditation, if perception and focus accompanied by the
dimension of infinite space beset them, that's an affliction for them.
Suppose a happy person were to experience pain; that would be an
affliction for them. In the same way, should perception and focus
accompanied by the dimension of infinite space beset them, that's an
affliction for them. And affliction has been called suffering by the
Buddha. That too is a way to understand how extinguishment is bliss.

Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of
infinite consciousness, aware that 'there is nothing at all', enters and
remains in the dimension of nothingness. While a mendicant is practicing
such a meditation, if perception and focus accompanied by the dimension
of infinite consciousness beset them, that's an affliction for them.
Suppose a happy person were to experience pain; that would be an
affliction for them. In the same way, should perception and focus
accompanied by the dimension of infinite consciousness beset them,
that's an affliction for them. And affliction has been called suffering
by the Buddha. That too is a way to understand how extinguishment is
bliss.

Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of
nothingness, enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception
nor non-perception. While a mendicant is practicing such a meditation,
if perception and focus accompanied by the dimension of nothingness
beset them, that's an affliction for them. Suppose a happy person were
to experience pain; that would be an affliction for them. In the same
way, should perception and focus accompanied by the dimension of
nothingness beset them, that's an affliction for them. And affliction
has been called suffering by the Buddha. That too is a way to understand
how extinguishment is bliss.

Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of
neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the
cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their
defilements come to an end.

That too is a way to understand how extinguishment is bliss."

### AN 9.35 The Simile of the Cow  *Gāvīupamāsutta*

"Mendicants, suppose there was a mountain cow who was foolish,
incompetent, unskillful, and lacked common sense when roaming on rugged
mountains. She might think, 'Why don't I go somewhere I've never been
before? I could eat grass and drink water that I've never tried before.'
She'd take a step with a fore-hoof; but before it was properly set down,
she'd lift up a hind-hoof. She wouldn't go somewhere she'd never been
before, or eat grass and drink water that she'd never tried before. And
she'd never return safely to the place she had started from. Why is
that? Because that mountain cow was foolish, incompetent, unskillful,
and lacked common sense when roaming on rugged mountains.

In the same way, some foolish, incompetent, unskillful mendicant,
lacking common sense, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded
from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption,
which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the
mind and keeping it connected. But they don't cultivate, develop, and
make much of that basis; they don't ensure it is properly stabilized.

They think, 'Why don't I, as the placing of the mind and keeping it
connected are stilled, enter and remain in the second absorption, which
has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and
mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.' But
they're not able to enter and remain in the second absorption. They
think, 'Why don't I, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded
from unskillful qualities, enter and remain in the first absorption,
which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the
mind and keeping it connected.' But they're not able to enter and remain
in the first absorption. This is called a mendicant who has slipped and
fallen from both sides. They're like the mountain cow who was foolish,
incompetent, unskillful, and lacking in common sense when roaming on
rugged mountains.

Suppose there was a mountain cow who was astute, competent, skillful,
and used common sense when roaming on rugged mountains. She might think,
'Why don't I go somewhere I've never been before? I could eat grass and
drink water that I've never tried before.' She'd take a step with a
fore-hoof; and after it was properly set down, she'd lift up a
hind-hoof. She'd go somewhere she'd never been before, and eat grass and
drink water that she'd never tried before. And she'd return safely to
the place she had started from. Why is that? Because that mountain cow
was astute, competent, skillful, and used common sense when roaming on
rugged mountains. In the same way, some astute, competent, skillful
mendicant, using common sense, quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first
absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while
placing the mind and keeping it connected. They cultivate, develop, and
make much of that basis, ensuring that it's properly stabilized.

They think, 'Why don't I, as the placing of the mind and keeping it
connected are stilled, enter and remain in the second absorption, which
has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and
mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.' Without
charging at the second absorption, as the placing of the mind and
keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second
absorption. They cultivate, develop, and make much of that basis,
ensuring that it's properly stabilized.

They think, 'Why don't I, with the fading away of rapture, enter and
remain in the third absorption, where I will meditate with equanimity,
mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble
ones declare, "Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss."' Without
charging at the third absorption, with the fading away of rapture, they
enter and remain in the third absorption. They cultivate, develop, and
make much of that basis, ensuring that it's properly stabilized.

They think, 'Why don't I, with the giving up of pleasure and pain, and
the ending of former happiness and sadness, enter and remain in the
fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and
mindfulness.' Without charging at the fourth absorption, with the giving
up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness,
they enter and remain in the fourth absorption. They cultivate, develop,
and make much of that basis, ensuring that it's properly stabilized.

They think, 'Why don't I, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with
the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of
diversity, aware that "space is infinite", enter and remain in the
dimension of infinite space.' Without charging at the dimension of
infinite space, with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain
in the dimension of infinite space. They cultivate, develop, and make
much of that basis, ensuring that it's properly stabilized.

They think, 'Why don't I, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite
space, aware that "consciousness is infinite", enter and remain in the
dimension of infinite consciousness.' Without charging at the dimension
of infinite consciousness, they enter and remain in the dimension of
infinite consciousness. They cultivate, develop, and make much of that
basis, ensuring that it's properly stabilized.

They think, 'Why don't I, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite
consciousness, aware that "there is nothing at all", enter and remain in
the dimension of nothingness.' Without charging at the dimension of
nothingness, they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness. They
cultivate, develop, and make much of that basis, ensuring that it's
properly stabilized.

They think, 'Why don't I, going totally beyond the dimension of
nothingness, enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor
non-perception.' Without charging at the dimension of neither perception
nor non-perception, they enter and remain in the dimension of neither
perception nor non-perception. They cultivate, develop, and make much of
that basis, ensuring that it's properly stabilized.

They think, 'Why don't I, going totally beyond the dimension of neither
perception nor non-perception, enter and remain in the cessation of
perception and feeling.' Without charging at the cessation of perception
and feeling, they enter and remain in the cessation of perception and
feeling.

When a mendicant enters and emerges from all these attainments, their
mind becomes pliable and workable. With a pliable and workable mind,
their immersion becomes limitless and well developed. They extend the
mind to realize by insight each and every thing that can be realized by
insight; and they are capable of realizing those things, since each and
every one is within range.

They might wish: 'May I wield the many kinds of psychic power:
multiplying myself and becoming one again ... controlling my body as far
as the realm of divinity.' They are capable of realizing it, since each
and every one is within range.

They might wish: 'With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman,
may I hear both kinds of sounds, human and heavenly, whether near or
far.' They are capable of realizing it, since each and every one is
within range.

They might wish: 'May I understand the minds of other beings and
individuals, having comprehended them with my mind. May I understand
mind with greed as "mind with greed", and mind without greed as "mind
without greed"; mind with hate as "mind with hate", and mind without
hate as "mind without hate"; mind with delusion as "mind with delusion",
and mind without delusion as "mind without delusion"; constricted mind
... scattered mind ... expansive mind ... unexpansive mind ... mind that
is not supreme ... mind that is supreme ... mind immersed in
samādhi ... mind not immersed in samādhi ...
freed mind ... and unfreed mind as "unfreed mind".' They are capable of
realizing it, since each and every one is within range.

They might wish: 'May I recollect many kinds of past lives. That is:
one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a
hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world
contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world
contracting and expanding. They remember: "There, I was named this, my
clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I
felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed
away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was
named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food.
This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended.
When I passed away from that place I was reborn here." May I recollect
my many past lives, with features and details.' They're capable of
realizing it, since each and every one is within range.

They might wish: 'With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, may
I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn---inferior and
superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place---and
understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.'
They're capable of realizing it, since each and every one is within
range.

They might wish: 'May I realize the undefiled freedom of heart and
freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with my
own insight due to the ending of defilements.' They're capable of
realizing it, since each and every one is within range."

### AN 9.36 Depending on Absorption  *Jhānasutta*

"Mendicants, I say that the first absorption is a basis for ending the
defilements. The second absorption is also a basis for ending the
defilements. The third absorption is also a basis for ending the
defilements. The fourth absorption is also a basis for ending the
defilements. The dimension of infinite space is also a basis for ending
the defilements. The dimension of infinite consciousness is also a basis
for ending the defilements. The dimension of nothingness is also a basis
for ending the defilements. The dimension of neither perception nor
non-perception is also a basis for ending the defilements. The cessation
of perception and feeling is also a basis for ending the defilements.

'The first absorption is a basis for ending the defilements.' That's
what I said, but why did I say it? Take a mendicant who, quite secluded
from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and
remains in the first absorption. They contemplate the phenomena
there---included in form, feeling, perception, choices, and
consciousness---as impermanent, as suffering, as diseased, as a boil, as
a dart, as misery, as an affliction, as alien, as falling apart, as
empty, as not-self. They turn their mind away from those things, and
apply it to freedom from death: 'This is peaceful; this is
sublime---that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all
attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation,
extinguishment.' Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements.
If they don't attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the
five lower fetters they're reborn spontaneously, because of their
passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and
are not liable to return from that world.

It's like an archer or their apprentice who first practices on a straw
man or a clay model. At a later time they become a long-distance
shooter, a marksman, who shatters large objects. In the same way a noble
disciple, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, enters and remains in
the first absorption. They contemplate the phenomena there---included in
form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness---as impermanent,
as suffering, as diseased, as a boil, as a dart, as misery, as an
affliction, as alien, as falling apart, as empty, as not-self. They turn
their mind away from those things, and apply it to freedom from death:

aware that 'space is infinite', enters and remains in the dimension of
infinite space. They contemplate the phenomena there---included in

mendicant who enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space. ...
'The dimension of infinite space is a basis for ending the defilements.'
That's what I said, and this is why I said it.

'The dimension of infinite consciousness is a basis for ending the
defilements.' ...

'The dimension of nothingness is a basis for ending the defilements.'
That's what I said, but why did I say it? Take a mendicant who, going
totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that
'there is nothing at all', enters and remains in the dimension of
nothingness. They contemplate the phenomena there---included in feeling,
perception, choices, and consciousness---as impermanent, as suffering,
as diseased, as a boil, as a dart, as misery, as an affliction, as

And so, mendicants, penetration to enlightenment extends as far as
attainments with perception. But the two dimensions that depend on
these---the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, and the
cessation of perception and feeling---are properly explained by
mendicants who are skilled in these attainments and skilled in emerging
from them, after they've entered them and emerged from them."

### AN 9.37 By Ānanda  *Ānandasutta*

At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Kosambī, in
Ghosita's Monastery. There Ānanda addressed the mendicants: "Reverends,
mendicants!"

"Reverend," they replied. Ānanda said this:

"It's incredible, reverends, it's amazing! How this Blessed One who
knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, has found
an opening amid confinement. It's in order to purify sentient beings, to
get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to
discover the system, and to realize extinguishment.

The eye itself is actually present, and so are those sights. Yet one
will not experience that sense-field. The ear itself is actually
present, and so are those sounds. Yet one will not experience that
sense-field. The nose itself is actually present, and so are those
smells. Yet one will not experience that sense-field. The tongue itself
is actually present, and so are those tastes. Yet one will not
experience that sense-field. The body itself is actually present, and so
are those touches. Yet one will not experience that sense-field."

When he said this, Venerable Udāyī said to Venerable
Ānanda:

"Reverend Ānanda, is one who doesn't experience that sense-field
actually percipient or not?"

"Reverend, one who doesn't experience that sense-field is actually
percipient, not non-percipient."

"But what does one who doesn't experience that sense-field perceive?"

"It's when a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with
the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of
diversity, aware that 'space is infinite', enters and remains in the
dimension of infinite space. One who doesn't experience that sense-field
perceives in this way.

Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite
space, aware that 'consciousness is infinite', enters and remains in the
dimension of infinite consciousness. One who doesn't experience that
sense-field perceives in this way.

Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite
consciousness, aware that 'there is nothing at all', enters and remains
in the dimension of nothingness. One who doesn't experience that
sense-field perceives in this way.

Reverend, this one time I was staying near Sāketa in the
deer park in Añjana Wood. Then the nun
Jaṭilagāhikā came up to me, bowed, stood to one side, and
said to me: 'Honorable Ānanda, regarding the immersion that does not
lean forward or pull back, and is not held in place by forceful
suppression. Being free, it's stable. Being stable, it's content. Being
content, one is not anxious. What did the Buddha say was the fruit of
this immersion?'

When she said this, I said to her: 'Sister, regarding the immersion that
does not lean forward or pull back, and is not held in place by forceful
suppression. Being free, it's stable. Being stable, it's content. Being
content, one is not anxious. The Buddha said that the fruit of this
immersion is enlightenment.' One who doesn't experience that sense-field
perceives in this way, too."

### AN 9.38 Brahmin Cosmologists  *Lokāyatikasutta*

Then two brahmin cosmologists went up to the Buddha, and exchanged
greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were
over, they sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:

"Mister Gotama, Pūraṇa Kassapa claims to be all-knowing and
all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus:
'Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me,
while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.' He says: 'With infinite
knowledge I know and see that the cosmos is infinite.' And the Jain
ascetic of the Ñātika clan also claims to be all-knowing
and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus:
'Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me,
while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.' He says: 'With infinite
knowledge I know and see that the cosmos is finite.' These two claim to
speak from knowledge, but they directly contradict each other. Which one
of them speaks the truth, and which falsehood?"

"Enough, brahmins, let that be. I will teach you the Dhamma. Listen and
apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes sir," those brahmins replied. The Buddha said this:

"Suppose there were four men standing in the four quarters. Each of them
was extremely fast, with an extremely mighty stride. They're as fast as
a light arrow easily shot across the shadow of a palm tree by a
well-trained expert archer with a strong bow. Their stride was such that
it spanned from the eastern ocean to the western ocean. Then the man
standing in the east would say: 'I will reach the end of the world by
traveling.' Though he'd travel for his whole lifespan of a hundred
years---pausing only to eat and drink, go to the toilet, and sleep to
dispel weariness---he'd die along the way, never reaching the end of the
world. Then the man standing in the west ... Then the man standing in
the north ... Then the man standing in the south would say: 'I will
reach the end of the world by traveling.' Though he'd travel for his
whole lifespan of a hundred years---pausing only to eat and drink, go to
the toilet, and sleep to dispel weariness---he'd die along the way,
never reaching the end of the world. Why is that? I say it's not
possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by running like
this. But I also say there's no making an end of suffering without
reaching the end of the world.

These five kinds of sensual stimulation are called the world in the
training of the Noble One. What five? Sights known by the eye, which are
likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. Sounds
known by the ear ... Smells known by the nose ... Tastes known by the
tongue ... Touches known by the body, which are likable, desirable,
agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. These five kinds of sensual
stimulation are called the world in the training of the Noble One.

Take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded
from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption,
which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the
mind and keeping it connected. This is called a mendicant who, having
gone to the end of the world, meditates at the end of the world. Others
say of them: 'They're included in the world, and haven't yet left the
world.' And I also say this: 'They're included in the world, and haven't
yet left the world.'

Furthermore, take a mendicant who, as the placing of the mind and
keeping it connected are stilled, enters and remains in the second
absorption ... third absorption ... fourth absorption. This is called a
mendicant who, having gone to the end of the world, meditates at the end
of the world. Others say of them: 'They're included in the world, and
haven't yet left the world.' And I also say this: 'They're included in
the world, and haven't yet left the world.'

Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond perceptions of
form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on
perceptions of diversity, aware that 'space is infinite', enters and
remains in the dimension of infinite space. This is called a mendicant
who, having gone to the end of the world, meditates at the end of the
world. Others say of them: 'They're included in the world, and haven't
yet left the world.' And I also say this: 'They're included in the
world, and haven't yet left the world.'

Furthermore, take a mendicant who enters and remains in the dimension of
infinite consciousness. ... the dimension of nothingness ... the
dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. This is called a
mendicant who, having gone to the end of the world, meditates at the end
of the world. Others say of them: 'They're included in the world, and
haven't yet left the world.' And I also say this: 'They're included in
the world, and haven't yet left the world.'

Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of
neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the
cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their
defilements come to an end. This is called a mendicant who, having gone
to the end of the world, meditates at the end of the world. And they've
crossed over clinging to the world."

### AN 9.39 The War Between the Gods and the Titans  *Devāsurasaṅgāmasutta*

"Once upon a time, mendicants, a battle was fought between the gods and
the titans. In that battle the titans won and the gods lost. Defeated,
the gods fled north with the titans in pursuit.

Then the gods thought, 'The titans are still in pursuit. Why don't we
engage them in battle a second time?' And so a second battle was fought
between the gods and the titans. And for a second time the titans won
and the gods lost. Defeated, the gods fled north with the titans in
pursuit.

Then the gods thought, 'The titans are still in pursuit. Why don't we
engage them in battle a third time?' And so a third battle was fought
between the gods and the titans. And for a third time the titans won and
the gods lost. Defeated and terrified, the gods fled right into the
castle of the gods.

When they had entered their castle, they thought, 'Now we're in a secure
location and the titans can't do anything to us.' The titans also
thought, 'Now the gods are in a secure location and we can't do anything
to them.'

Once upon a time, a battle was fought between the gods and the titans.
In that battle the gods won and the titans lost. Defeated, the titans
fled south with the gods in pursuit.

Then the titans thought, 'The gods are still in pursuit. Why don't we
engage them in battle a second time?' And so a second battle was fought
between the gods and the titans. And for a second time the gods won and
the titans lost. Defeated, the titans fled south with the gods in
pursuit.

Then the titans thought, 'The gods are still in pursuit. Why don't we
engage them in battle a third time?' And so a third battle was fought
between the gods and the titans. And for a third time the gods won and
the titans lost. Defeated and terrified, the titans fled right into the
citadel of the titans.

When they had entered their citadel, they thought, 'Now we're in a
secure location and the gods can't do anything to us.' And the gods also
thought, 'Now the titans are in a secure location and we can't do
anything to them.'

In the same way, there's a time when a mendicant, quite secluded from
sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and
remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of
seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. At that time
the mendicant thinks, 'Now I'm in a secure location and
Māra can't do anything to me.' And Māra the
Wicked also thinks, 'Now the mendicant is in a secure location and we
can't do anything to them.'

There's a time when, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected
are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption ...
third absorption ... fourth absorption. At that time the mendicant
thinks, 'Now I'm in a secure location and Māra can't do
anything to me.' And Māra the Wicked also thinks, 'Now the
mendicant is in a secure location and we can't do anything to them.'

There's a time when a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of
form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on
perceptions of diversity, aware that 'space is infinite', enters and
remains in the dimension of infinite space. This is called a mendicant
who has blinded Māra, put out his eyes without a trace, and
gone where the Wicked One cannot see.

There's a time when a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of
infinite space, aware that 'consciousness is infinite', enters and
remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. ... Going totally
beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that 'there is
nothing at all', they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness.
... Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, they enter and
remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. ...

Going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor
non-perception, they enter and remain in the cessation of perception and
feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their defilements come to an end.
This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra, put out
his eyes without a trace, and gone where the Wicked One cannot see. And
they've crossed over clinging to the world."

### AN 9.40 The Simile of the Bull Elephant in the Forest  *Nāgasutta*

"Mendicants, when a wild bull elephant is engrossed in the pasture, but
other elephants---males, females, younglings, or cubs---got there first
and trampled the grass, the wild bull elephant is horrified, repelled,
and disgusted by that. When the wild bull elephant is engrossed in the
pasture, but other elephants---males, females, younglings, or cubs---eat
the broken branches that he has dragged down, the wild bull elephant is
horrified, repelled, and disgusted by that. When a wild bull elephant
has plunged into the pool, but other elephants---males, females,
younglings, or cubs---got there first and stirred up the water with
their trunks, the wild bull elephant is horrified, repelled, and
disgusted by that. When a wild bull elephant has come out of the pool
and the female elephants bump into him, the wild bull elephant is
horrified, repelled, and disgusted by that.

At that time the wild bull elephant thinks: 'These days I live crowded
by other males, females, younglings, and cubs. I eat the grass they've
trampled, and they eat the broken branches I've dragged down. I drink
muddy water, and after my bath the female elephants bump into me. Why
don't I live alone, withdrawn from the herd?' After some time he lives
alone, withdrawn from the herd, and he eats untrampled grass, and other
elephants don't eat the broken branches he has dragged down. He doesn't
drink muddy water, and the female elephants don't bump into him after
his bath.

At that time the wild bull elephant thinks: 'Formerly I lived crowded by
other males, females, younglings, and cubs. I ate the grass they'd
trampled, and they ate the broken branches I'd dragged down. I drank
muddy water, and after my bath the female elephants bumped into me. Now
I live alone, and I'm free of all these things.' He breaks off a branch
and scratches his body, happily relieving his itches.

In the same way, when a mendicant lives crowded by monks, nuns, laymen,
and laywomen; by rulers and their chief ministers, and by monastics of
other religions and their disciples, they think: 'These days I live
crowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their chief
ministers, and monastics of other religions and their disciples. Why
don't I live alone, withdrawn from the group?' They frequent a secluded
lodging---a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain
cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw. Gone to
a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, they sit
down cross-legged, set their body straight, and establish mindfulness in
their presence.

Giving up covetousness for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of
covetousness, cleansing the mind of covetousness. Giving up ill will and
malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of sympathy
for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will. Giving up
dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind free of dullness and
drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of
dullness and drowsiness. Giving up restlessness and remorse, they
meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the
mind of restlessness and remorse. Giving up doubt, they meditate having
gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the
mind of doubt. They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the
heart that weaken wisdom. Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first
absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while
placing the mind and keeping it connected. They happily relieve their
itches. As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled,
they enter and remain in the second absorption ... third absorption ...
fourth absorption. They happily relieve their itches.

Going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions
of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that
'space is infinite', they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite
space. They happily relieve their itches. Going totally beyond the
dimension of infinite space, aware that 'consciousness is infinite',
they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness. ...
Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that
'there is nothing at all', they enter and remain in the dimension of
nothingness. ... Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, they
enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor
non-perception. ... Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally
beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enters
and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen
with wisdom, their defilements come to an end. They happily relieve
their itches."

### AN 9.41 With the Householder Tapussa  *Tapussasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Mallas, near the
Mallian town named Uruvelakappa.

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
entered Uruvelakappa for alms. Then, after the meal, on his return from
almsround, he addressed Venerable Ānanda, "Ānanda, you stay right here,
while I plunge deep into the Great Wood for the day's meditation."

"Yes, sir," Ānanda replied. Then the Buddha plunged deep into the Great
Wood and sat at the root of a tree for the day's meditation.

The householder Tapussa went up to Venerable Ānanda, bowed, sat down to
one side, and said to him:

"Honorable Ānanda, we are laypeople who enjoy sensual pleasures. We like
sensual pleasures, we love them and take joy in them. But renunciation
seems like an abyss. I have heard that in this teaching and training
there are very young mendicants whose minds leap forth, gain confidence,
settle down, and become decided in renunciation. They see it as
peaceful. Renunciation is the dividing line between the multitude and
the mendicants in this teaching and training."

"Householder, we should see the Buddha about this matter. Come, let's go
to the Buddha and inform him about this. As he answers, so we'll
remember it."

"Yes, sir," replied Tapussa. Then Ānanda together with Tapussa went to
the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Ānanda told him what had
happened.

"That's so true, Ānanda! That's so true! Before my awakening---when I
was still unawakened but intent on awakening---I too thought,
'Renunciation is good! Seclusion is good!' But my mind did not leap
forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become decided in renunciation.
I didn't see it as peaceful. Then I thought, 'What is the cause, what is
the reason why my mind does not leap forth, gain confidence, settle
down, and become decided in renunciation? Why don't I see it as
peaceful?' Then I thought, 'I haven't seen the drawbacks of sensual
pleasures, and so I haven't cultivated that. I haven't realized the
benefits of renunciation, and so I haven't developed that. That's why my
mind does not leap forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become
decided in renunciation. And it's why I don't see it as peaceful.' Then
I thought, 'Suppose that, seeing the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, I
were to cultivate that. And suppose that, realizing the benefits of
renunciation, I were to develop that. It's possible that my mind would
leap forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become decided in
renunciation. And I would see it as peaceful.' And so, after some time,
I saw the drawbacks of sensual pleasures and cultivated that, and I
realized the benefits of renunciation and developed that. Then my mind
leapt forth, gained confidence, settled down, and became decided in
renunciation. I saw it as peaceful. And so, quite secluded from sensual
pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in
the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion,
while placing the mind and keeping it connected. While I was in that
meditation, perception and focus accompanied by sensual pleasures beset
me, and that was an affliction for me. Suppose a happy person were to
experience pain; that would be an affliction for them. In the same way,
when perception and focus accompanied by sensual pleasures beset me,
that was an affliction for me.

Then I thought, 'Why don't I, as the placing of the mind and keeping it
connected are stilled ... enter and remain in the second absorption?'
But my mind did not leap forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become
decided in not placing the mind. I didn't see it as peaceful. Then I
thought, 'What is the cause, what is the reason why my mind does not
leap forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become decided in not
placing the mind? Why don't I see it as peaceful?' Then I thought, 'I
haven't seen the drawbacks of placing the mind, and so I haven't
cultivated that. I haven't realized the benefits of not placing the
mind, and so I haven't developed that. That's why my mind does not leap
forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become decided in not placing
the mind. And it's why I don't see it as peaceful.' Then I thought,
'Suppose that, seeing the drawbacks of placing the mind, I were to
cultivate that. And suppose that, realizing the benefits of not placing
the mind, I were to develop that. It's possible that my mind would leap
forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become decided in not placing
the mind. And I would see it as peaceful.' And so, after some time, I
saw the drawbacks of placing the mind and cultivated that, and I
realized the benefits of not placing the mind and developed that. Then
my mind did leap forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become decided
in not placing the mind. I saw it as peaceful. And so, as the placing of
the mind and keeping it connected were stilled ... I entered and
remained in the second absorption. While I was in that meditation,
perception and focus accompanied by placing the mind beset me, and that
was an affliction for me. Suppose a happy person were to experience
pain; that would be an affliction for them. In the same way, when
perception and focus accompanied by placing the mind and keeping it
connected beset me, that was an affliction for me.

Then I thought, 'Why don't I, with the fading away of rapture, enter and
remain in the third absorption, where I will meditate with equanimity,
mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble
ones declare, "Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss"?' But my
mind did not leap forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become
decided in freedom from rapture. I didn't see it as peaceful. Then I
thought, 'What is the cause, what is the reason why my mind does not
leap forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become decided in freedom
from rapture? Why don't I see it as peaceful?' Then I thought, 'I
haven't seen the drawbacks of rapture, and so I haven't cultivated that.
I haven't realized the benefits of freedom from rapture, and so I
haven't developed that. That's why my mind does not leap forth, gain
confidence, settle down, and become decided in freedom from rapture. And
it's why I don't see it as peaceful.' Then I thought, 'Suppose that,
seeing the drawbacks of rapture, I were to cultivate that. And suppose
that, realizing the benefits of freedom from rapture, I were to develop
that. It's possible that my mind would leap forth, gain confidence,
settle down, and become decided in being free from rapture. And I would
see it as peaceful.' And so, after some time, I saw the drawbacks of
rapture and cultivated that, and I realized the benefits of freedom from
rapture and developed that. Then my mind leapt forth, gained confidence,
settled down, and became decided in freedom from rapture. I saw it as
peaceful. And so, with the fading away of rapture ... I entered and
remained in the third absorption. While I was in that meditation,
perception and focus accompanied by rapture beset me, and that was an
affliction for me. Suppose a happy person were to experience pain; that
would be an affliction for them. In the same way, when perception and
focus accompanied by rapture beset me, that was an affliction for me.

Then I thought, 'Why don't I, with the giving up of pleasure and pain,
and the ending of former happiness and sadness, enter and remain in the
fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and
mindfulness?' But my mind did not leap forth, gain confidence, settle
down, and become decided in being without pleasure and pain. I didn't
see it as peaceful. Then I thought, 'What is the cause, what is the
reason why my mind does not leap forth, gain confidence, settle down,
and become decided in being without pleasure and pain? Why don't I see
it as peaceful?' Then I thought, 'I haven't seen the drawbacks of bliss
with equanimity, and so I haven't cultivated that. I haven't realized
the benefits of being without pleasure and pain, and so I haven't
developed that. That's why my mind does not leap forth, gain confidence,
settle down, and become decided in being without pleasure and pain. And
it's why I don't see it as peaceful.' Then I thought, 'Suppose that,
seeing the drawbacks of bliss with equanimity, I were to cultivate that.
And suppose that, realizing the benefits of being without pleasure and
pain, I were to develop that. It's possible that my mind would leap
forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become decided in being without
pleasure and pain. And I would see it as peaceful.' And so, after some
time, I saw the drawbacks of bliss with equanimity and cultivated that,
and I realized the benefits of being without pleasure and pain and
developed that. Then my mind did leap forth, gain confidence, settle
down, and become decided in being without pleasure and pain. I saw it as
peaceful. And so, giving up pleasure and pain ... I entered and remained
in the fourth absorption. While I was in that meditation, perception and
focus accompanied by bliss with equanimity beset me, and that was an
affliction for me. Suppose a happy person were to experience pain; that
would be an affliction for them. In the same way, when perception and
focus accompanied by bliss with equanimity beset me, that was an
affliction for me.

Then I thought, 'Why don't I, going totally beyond perceptions of form,
with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on
perceptions of diversity, aware that "space is infinite", enter and
remain in the dimension of infinite space?' But my mind did not leap
forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become decided in the dimension
of infinite space. I didn't see it as peaceful. Then I thought, 'What is
the cause, what is the reason why my mind does not leap forth, gain
confidence, settle down, and become decided in the dimension of infinite
space? Why don't I see it as peaceful?' Then I thought, 'I haven't seen
the drawbacks of forms, and so I haven't cultivated that. I haven't
realized the benefits of the dimension of infinite space, and so I
haven't developed that. That's why my mind does not leap forth, gain
confidence, settle down, and become decided in the dimension of infinite
space. And it's why I don't see it as peaceful.' Then I thought,
'Suppose that, seeing the drawbacks of forms, I were to cultivate that.
And suppose that, realizing the benefits of the dimension of infinite
space, I were to develop that. It's possible that my mind would leap
forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become decided in the dimension
of infinite space. And I would see it as peaceful.' And so, after some
time, I saw the drawbacks of forms and cultivated that, and I realized
the benefits of the dimension of infinite space and developed that. Then
my mind leapt forth, gained confidence, settled down, and became decided
in the dimension of infinite space. I saw it as peaceful. And so, going
totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of
impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that 'space
is infinite', I entered and remained in the dimension of infinite space.
While I was in that meditation, perception and focus accompanied by
forms beset me, and that was an affliction for me. Suppose a happy
person were to experience pain; that would be an affliction for them. In
the same way, when perception and focus accompanied by forms beset me,
that was an affliction for me.

Then I thought, 'Why don't I, going totally beyond the dimension of
infinite space, aware that "consciousness is infinite", enter and remain
in the dimension of infinite consciousness?' But my mind did not leap
forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become decided in the dimension
of infinite consciousness. I didn't see it as peaceful. Then I thought,
'What is the cause, what is the reason why my mind does not leap forth,
gain confidence, settle down, and become decided in the dimension of
infinite consciousness? Why don't I see it as peaceful?' Then I thought,
'I haven't seen the drawbacks of the dimension of infinite space, and so
I haven't cultivated that. I haven't realized the benefits of the
dimension of infinite consciousness, and so I haven't developed that.
That's why my mind does not leap forth, gain confidence, settle down,
and become decided in the dimension of infinite consciousness. And it's
why I don't see it as peaceful.' Then I thought, 'Suppose that, seeing
the drawbacks of the dimension of infinite space, I were to cultivate
that. And suppose that, realizing the benefits of the dimension of
infinite consciousness, I were to develop that. It's possible that my
mind would leap forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become decided
in the dimension of infinite consciousness. And I would see it as
peaceful.' And so, after some time, I saw the drawbacks of the dimension
of infinite space and cultivated that, and I realized the benefits of
the dimension of infinite consciousness and developed that. Then my mind
leapt forth, gained confidence, settled down, and became decided in the
dimension of infinite consciousness. I saw it as peaceful. And so, going
totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that
'consciousness is infinite', I entered and remained in the dimension of
infinite consciousness. While I was in that meditation, perception and
focus accompanied by the dimension of infinite space beset me, and that
was an affliction for me. Suppose a happy person were to experience
pain; that would be an affliction for them. In the same way, when
perception and focus accompanied by the dimension of infinite space
beset me, that was an affliction for me.

Then I thought, 'Why don't I, going totally beyond the dimension of
infinite consciousness, aware that "there is nothing at all", enter and
remain in the dimension of nothingness?' But my mind did not leap forth,
gain confidence, settle down, and become decided in the dimension of
nothingness. I didn't see it as peaceful. Then I thought, 'What is the
cause, what is the reason why my mind does not leap forth, gain
confidence, settle down, and become decided in the dimension of
nothingness? Why don't I see it as peaceful?' Then I thought, 'I haven't
seen the drawbacks of the dimension of infinite consciousness, and so I
haven't cultivated that. I haven't realized the benefits of the
dimension of nothingness, and so I haven't developed that. That's why my
mind does not leap forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become

suppose that, realizing the benefits of the dimension of nothingness, I
were to develop that. It's possible that my mind would leap forth, gain
confidence, settle down, and become decided in the dimension of
nothingness. And I would see it as peaceful.' And so, after some time, I
saw the drawbacks of the dimension of infinite consciousness and
cultivated that, and I realized the benefits of the dimension of
nothingness and developed that. Then my mind leapt forth, gained
confidence, settled down, and became decided in the dimension of
nothingness. I saw it as peaceful. And so, going totally beyond the

for me. Suppose a happy person were to experience pain; that would be an

accompanied by the dimension of infinite consciousness beset me, that
was an affliction for me.

Then I thought, 'Why don't I, going totally beyond the dimension of
nothingness, enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor
non-perception?' But my mind did not leap forth, gain confidence, settle
down, and become decided in the dimension of neither perception nor
non-perception. I didn't see it as peaceful. Then I thought, 'What is
the cause, what is the reason why my mind does not leap forth, gain

totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, I
entered and remained in the cessation of perception and feeling. And,
having seen with wisdom, my defilements were ended.

As long as I hadn't entered into and withdrawn from these nine
progressive meditative attainments in both forward and reverse order, I
didn't announce my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its
gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its
ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.

But when I had entered into and withdrawn from these nine progressive
meditative attainments in both forward and reverse order, I announced my
supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods,

Knowledge and vision arose in me: 'My freedom is unshakable; this is my
last rebirth; now there'll be no more future lives.'"

## The Chapter on Similarity

### AN 9.42 Cramped  *Sambādhasutta*

At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Kosambī, in
Ghosita's Monastery. Then Venerable Udāyī went up to
Venerable Ānanda and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings
and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to
Ānanda, "Reverend, this was said by the god Pañcālacaṇḍa:

> 'The opening amid confinement\
> was discovered by the Buddha of vast intelligence,\
> who woke up to absorption,\
> the sage, the solitary bull.'

But what is confinement, and what is the opening amid confinement that
the Buddha spoke of?"

"Reverend, these five kinds of sensual stimulation are called
'confinement' by the Buddha. What five? Sights known by the eye that are
likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. Sounds
known by the ear ... Smells known by the nose ... Tastes known by the
tongue ... Touches known by the body, which are likable, desirable,
agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. These are the five kinds of
sensual stimulation that are called 'confinement' by the Buddha.

Now, take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures ...
enters and remains in the first absorption. To this extent the Buddha
spoke of an opening amid confinement in a qualified sense. But it is
still confined. Confined by what? Whatever placing of the mind and
keeping it connected has not ceased is the confinement there.

Furthermore, take a mendicant who, as the placing of the mind and
keeping it connected are stilled ... enters and remains in the second
absorption. To this extent the Buddha spoke of an opening amid
confinement in a qualified sense. But it is still confined. Confined by
what? Whatever rapture has not ceased is the confinement there.

Furthermore, take a mendicant who, with the fading away of rapture ...
enters and remains in the third absorption. To this extent the Buddha
spoke of creating an opening amid confinement in a qualified sense. But
it is still confined. Confined by what? Whatever bliss with equanimity
has not ceased is the confinement there.

Furthermore, take a mendicant who, giving up pleasure and pain ...
enters and remains in the fourth absorption. To this extent the Buddha
spoke of an opening amid confinement in a qualified sense. But it is
still confined. Confined by what? Whatever perception of form has not
ceased is the confinement there.

Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond perceptions of
form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on
perceptions of diversity, aware that 'space is infinite', enters and
remains in the dimension of infinite space. To this extent the Buddha
spoke of an opening amid confinement in a qualified sense. But it is
still confined. Confined by what? Whatever perception of the dimension
of infinite space has not ceased is the confinement there.

Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite
space, aware that 'consciousness is infinite', enters and remains in the
dimension of infinite consciousness. To this extent the Buddha spoke of
an opening amid confinement in a qualified sense. But it is still
confined. Confined by what? Whatever perception of the dimension of
infinite consciousness has not ceased is the confinement there.

Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite
consciousness, aware that 'there is nothing at all', enters and remains
in the dimension of nothingness. To this extent the Buddha spoke of an
opening amid confinement in a qualified sense. But it is still confined.
Confined by what? Whatever perception of the dimension of nothingness
has not ceased is the confinement there.

Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of
nothingness, enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception
nor non-perception. To this extent the Buddha spoke of an opening amid
confinement in a qualified sense. But it is still confined. Confined by
what? Whatever perception of neither perception nor non-perception has
not ceased is the confinement there.

Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of
neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the
cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their
defilements come to an end. To this extent the Buddha spoke of an
opening amid confinement in a definitive sense."

### AN 9.43 A Direct Witness  *Kāyasakkhīsutta*

"Reverend, they speak of a person called 'direct witness'. What is the
direct witness that the Buddha spoke of?"

"First, take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures ...
enters and remains in the first absorption. They meditate directly
experiencing that dimension in every way. To this extent the Buddha
spoke of the direct witness in a qualified sense.

Furthermore, take a mendicant who, as the placing of the mind and
keeping it connected are stilled, enters and remains in the second
absorption ... third absorption ... fourth absorption. They meditate
directly experiencing that dimension in every way. To this extent the
Buddha spoke of the direct witness in a qualified sense.

Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond perceptions of
form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on
perceptions of diversity, aware that 'space is infinite', enters and
remains in the dimension of infinite space. They meditate directly
experiencing that dimension in every way. To this extent the Buddha
spoke of the direct witness in a qualified sense. Furthermore, take a
mendicant who enters and remains in the dimension of infinite
consciousness ... the dimension of nothingness ... the dimension of
neither perception nor non-perception ...

Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of
neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the
cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their
defilements come to an end. They meditate directly experiencing that
dimension in every way. To this extent the Buddha spoke of the direct
witness in a definitive sense."

### AN 9.44 Freed by Wisdom  *Paññāvimuttasutta*

"Reverend, they speak of a person called 'freed by wisdom'. What is the
one freed by wisdom that the Buddha spoke of?"

"First, take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures ...
enters and remains in the first absorption. And they understand that
with wisdom. To this extent the Buddha spoke of the one freed by wisdom
in a qualified sense. ...

Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of
neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the
cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their
defilements come to an end. And they understand that with wisdom. To
this extent the Buddha spoke of the one freed by wisdom in a definitive
sense."

<!--pg-->
### AN 9.45 Freed Both Ways  *Ubhatobhāgavimuttasutta*

"Reverend, they speak of a person called 'freed both ways'. What is the
one freed both ways that the Buddha spoke of?"

"First, take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures ...
enters and remains in the first absorption. They meditate directly
experiencing that dimension in every way. And they understand that with
wisdom. To this extent the Buddha spoke of the one freed both ways in a
qualified sense. ...

Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of
neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the
cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their
defilements come to an end. They meditate directly experiencing that
dimension in every way. And they understand that with wisdom. To this
extent the Buddha spoke of the one freed both ways in a definitive
sense."

### AN 9.46 In the Present Life  *Sandiṭṭhikadhammasutta*

"Reverend, they speak of 'a teaching apparent in the present life'. In
what way did the Buddha speak of a teaching apparent in the present
life?"

"First, take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures ...
enters and remains in the first absorption. To this extent the Buddha
spoke of the teaching apparent in the present life in a qualified sense.
...

Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of
neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the
cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their
defilements come to an end. To this extent the Buddha spoke of the
teaching apparent in the present life in a definitive sense."
