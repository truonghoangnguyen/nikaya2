## The SuttaCentral Editions Series

Since 2005 SuttaCentral has provided access to the texts, translations,
and parallels of early Buddhist texts. In 2018 we started creating and
publishing our translations of these seminal spiritual classics. The
"Editions" series now makes selected translations available as books in
various forms, including print, PDF, and EPUB.

Editions are selected from our most complete, well-crafted, and reliable
translations. They aim to bring these texts to a wider audience in forms
that reward mindful reading. Care is taken with every detail of the
production, and we aim to meet or exceed professional best standards in
every way. These are the core scriptures underlying the entire Buddhist
tradition, and we believe that they deserve to be preserved and made
available in the highest quality without compromise.

SuttaCentral is a charitable organization. Our work is accomplished by
volunteers and through the generosity of our donors. Everything we
create is offered to all of humanity free of any copyright or licensing
restrictions.

## Preface

The topic of the future weighs heavily on the mind of the
Aṅguttara. We live in that future or beyond it. The "future
perils" of the Aṅguttara (AN 5.77--80) are upon us and have
been for quite some time. King Ashoka referred to these suttas, which
include the peril of corruption in the Saṅgha; perhaps he
worried that his generosity, though intended to support Buddhism, would
ultimately lead to its decay.

Today the future perils are greater than ever. It is as if the seven
suns are appearing in the sky (AN 7.66). We want to face the future with
hope for a better life, but the horizon dims and draws closer, while we
clutch our loved ones and prepare for the worst.

It was the novelist William Gibson who said, "the future is already
here---it's just not very evenly distributed". His saying conceals
layers of meaning. The future is here because we see scientific,
technological, and human marvels every day that are far beyond our
comprehension. Yet such advances are for the few, and only trickle
gradually, if at all, to people in need. The future is also here in a
negative sense, in that the catastrophic effects of climate collapse are
readily apparent; and yet there too, their effects are unevenly
distributed, massively impacting those who have the least capacity to
deal with them.

The way of the Dhamma is to neither deny such things nor to be paralyzed
by them, but to live, urgently and vitally, in the present. We live as
if the future was uncertain, because it is. Our only certainty is that
all this will disappear.

The Buddha stayed calm in the face of terrors. Living well now, we let
the future take care of itself. The Buddha did not pretend to be able to
control the future, so why should we?

As a Buddhist, I might rephrase Gibson's saying: "the present is already
here---it's just not very evenly distributed". The art of meditation is
the art of presence, and in that presence, we can be grateful for all
that we have, mindful of all our blessings, and fearless when facing the
future. It is when we lose our presence that our fears can overcome us.
So let us not lose our presence.

## The Numbered Discourses: things that are useful every day

::: flushright
*Bhikkhu Sujato, 2019*
:::

The Aṅguttara Nikāya is the last and longest
of the four primary divisions of the Sutta Piṭaka. The word
*aṅguttara* means "up by one factor", i.e. "incremental".
It refers to the fact that the discourses are arranged by numbered sets,
with the numbers increasing by one. I have translated it as *Numbered
Discourses*, while previously it has been translated as the *Numerical
Discourses* or the *Gradual Sayings*.

SuttaCentral follows Bhikkhu Bodhi's translation in counting 8122
discourses in total. The summary verse at the end of the collection,
however, says there are 9,557 suttas. This scribal remark does not say
how this count was arrived at; it must have been quite a process to
count so many discourses when dealing only with palm-leaf manuscripts.
In any case, as with the Saṁyutta Nikāya, this
count is largely a product of discourses repeated according to
templates. Many of these consist only of a single word; indeed, the
process of abbreviation is carried to such extremes that hundreds of
suttas do not exist at all in the text; they are merely numbers to be
filled out. Also, in the case of the Ones and Twos, most of the suttas
are longer texts that have been divided to make the numbers. On
SuttaCentral, these are treated as if one *vagga* was a sutta, and the
abbreviated texts likewise are combined. If we count the files of the
texts combined in this way, we arrive at more reasonable, but still very
large, 1407 texts of substance.

The focus of the *Numbered Discourses* is on practical matters of
everyday relevance. Guidelines of ethics and character predominate. If
the Saṁyutta Nikāya gathers the chief
teachings on *doctrines*, the Aṅguttara gathers the
teachings on *persons*. The concerns of the lay community are a major
focus, and many teachings deal with how to teach.

The use of numbered sets is found throughout the Buddhist texts, but
here it becomes the main organizing principle. The typical
Aṅguttara discourse consists of a statement that there is
certain number of something; then an explanation of each item; then a
conclusion that echoes the introduction. Sometimes a verse is added that
summarizes the content. This formal pattern is highly optimized to
reinforce learning and memorization. It is, in essence, the same format
that is used in the nightly news: begin by listing the news items for
today; give the stories of each of the items; and then summarize the
highlights once more. The use of numbered sets remains popular today,
with the "listicle" being a favorite format for internet articles.

Unlike these modern examples, however, the sets of teachings in the
Aṅguttara are strongly structured. They are not merely
collections of items on a theme, but make up an integrated sequence. The
first item is the most fundamental; the subsequent items evolve from or
build upon that; and the final item caps off the sequence.

For this reason the Aṅguttara provides an excellent entry
point to the canon, especially for those with a limited amount of time.
It only takes a few minutes to read a sutta, and it will contain within
itself a complete and useful teaching.

The Aṅguttara Nikāya has a counterpart in the
Ekottarikāgama preserved in the Chinese canon (EA). The
Ekottarikāgama is a peculiar text of uncertain (possibly
Mahāsaṅghika) affiliation, and it differs from the Pali
text to a much greater extent than the parallels for DN, MN, and SN. In
addition, there are two partial Ekottarikas in Chinese, as well as
several independent Ekottarika-style suttas. Moreover, a substantial
portion of a Sanskrit Ekottarāgama was discovered at Gilgit
and has been edited and partially reconstructed by
Tripāṭhi. While it is difficult to generalize, it seems as
if most of these materials lie closer to the Pali text than the main EA
in Chinese.

### How the Aṅguttara is Organized

The Aṅguttara Nikāya consists of major "books"
(*nipāta*) numbered one through eleven. Each of these
contains discourses consisting of the corresponding number of items. As
usual, the discourses are gathered into *vaggas*, which sometimes have a
loose theme. Each *nipāta*, except the first, organizes its
*vaggas* into *paṇṇāsas*.

I don't know why the Aṅguttara counts to eleven; I would
expect a round number. Eleven is shared in common with the Chinese
Ekottarikāgama, which suggests it was an early feature, yet
it does not appear to be driven by the texts themselves, as most of the
items in the Book of the Elevens consist of teachings familiar
elsewhere, with the addition of an item or two.

It sometimes feels as if the Aṅguttara was assembled from
leftovers. After the long suttas were gathered in the Majjhima and
Dīgha, and the shorter suttas on central themes into the
Saṁyutta, a large mass of texts remained that resisted easy
categorization. This included many fascinating and profound teachings,
as well as a large mass of stock repetitions, and it trailed off into
odds and ends of increasingly obscure value. It's as if the redactors,
faced with a warehouse of leftovers and bric-à-brac, tried their best to
shelve and stack the items in a logical way, but were often left with
just plonking things on shelves as best they could. Since the texts
usually had a distinct number in the teaching, this was taken as the
organizational principle, in lieu of anything more meaningful. Even
texts that don't explicitly mention a number can often be analyzed into
a set of items, so they could be included too. (See for example [AN
3.31](https://suttacentral.net/an3.31) and [AN
3.32](https://suttacentral.net/an3.32).)

To be clear, it should not be thought that the Aṅguttara
lacks the standard teachings familiar from the rest of the
*nikāyas*. On the contrary, we find the four absorptions
([AN 3.58](https://suttacentral.net/an3.58)), the four noble truths and
dependent origination ([AN 3.61](https://suttacentral.net/an3.61)), the
faculties and powers ([AN 4.163](https://suttacentral.net/an4.163); the
latter in some detail at [AN
5.12--16](https://suttacentral.net/an5.12)), the threefold training ([AN
3.81](https://suttacentral.net/an3.81)), the divine meditations ([AN
3.63](https://suttacentral.net/an3.63)), and many more. But such
teachings are scattered throughout a large mass of suttas on a diverse
range of topics.

In the introduction to his translation, Bhikkhu Bodhi practically
abandons any attempt to make sense of the structure. He gives an example
of a chapter with several seemingly unrelated discourses, remarking:
"With such apparently arbitrary organization, one cannot but wonder what
the compilers had in mind." (*The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha*,
introduction, p. 22). As a result, rather than analyze the content as it
occurs in the Aṅguttara, he developed an extensive and
carefully-considered thematic analysis. [This essay is available on
SuttaCentral](https://suttacentral.net/an-introduction-bodhi), and I
encourage anyone interested in a serious study of the
Aṅguttara to read it.

I would like to approach the material from a different perspective,
however, one that lies closer to the experience of reading the text. I
find Bhikkhu Bodhi's question an intriguing one: what were the redactors
thinking?

While there is no doubt that the sequence of suttas and ideas in the
Aṅguttara is to some extent chaotic, is it plausible that
the same body of people who displayed such rigorous dedication to
classification in the Saṁyutta should simply abandon their
efforts in the Aṅguttara? Perhaps to understand the
redactors better, and through them the teachings that they worked with,
we must approach the problem in a new way.

Here are three organizational principles that I have noticed while
reading the Aṅguttara:

1.  Numerological meaning.

2.  Thematic clusters, segues, and arcs.

3.  Spaced repetition.

Below I will show how these things work out over the first three
*nipātas*. In this way, I hope to guide a reader through
the wilds until they feel comfortable proceeding on their own.

It is surely not the case that these are the only organizational
principles at work. Nor is it the case that they fully explain all, or
even most, of the randomness. But they do, I believe, hint at a guiding
understanding that shaped the collection in the form we have it today.

One general thought first. Much of how we organize and relate to the
world is not through reason but through association. If we think of it
in terms of the five aggregates, a collection such as the
Saṁyutta Nikāya has an overall structure that
is deliberately thought through and constructed, i.e. it is based on
rational choices or *saṅkhārās*. Perhaps what we need to
look for in the Aṅguttara is a different way of thinking,
one based on perception, memory, and association (*saññā*).

But why would such a large mass of texts be organized in such a way? The
answer is not hard to find. Like so many of the principles that organize
the texts, it is for memorization. For a reciter who has to keep
hundreds of texts in order, *any* kind of connection works. It doesn't
matter if it's the topic, a shared word, a syntax, a rhyme, or anything
else. Perception recognizes patterns. It associates one thing with the
next, regardless of how significant the connecting feature is.

Imagine, if you will, that you're organizing your library. You could use
a rational system: alphabetical order, subject matter, or size to fit
your shelves. But it's your library, you can do what you want. Maybe on
one shelf, you put books with blue covers; on another, books you haven't
read; and on another, books whose smell reminds you of old friends. To
anyone else it seems chaotic, but to you it makes perfect sense. You can
find the book you need when you want to. Perception does the heavy
lifting for you, without the cognitive strain of having to work through
the rational system every time.

#### The meaning of numbers

For the most part the use of numbers in Buddhist texts is entirely
pragmatic. Once you know that a set has a certain number of items, you
can tell if you've forgotten something.

Yet numbers have always been imbued with a significance and meaning that
transcends mere accounting. They allow us to make sense of a complex
cosmos through a simple set of conventions. Numbers are used in Buddhism
to provoke awe, even fear, at the "astronomical" scope of
transmigration. Is it possible that the symbolic meaning of numbers
lends a sense of unity to the various *nipātas*?

Symbolic meaning is, by its very nature, impossible to pin down with
precision. Unlike rational definition, it does not serve to limit the
scope of meaning but to amplify it through suggestion, hints, and
connotations. The symbolic meaning of numbers has, so far as I know,
mostly been ignored in Buddhist studies. Some numerological observations
were made in the number entries in the Rhys Davids' and Stede's
*Pali-English Dictionary*, but I am aware of little since then. However,
we can make a few general observations.

One

:   The number of harmony, simplicity, and supremacy. It is especially
    emphasized in the context of deep meditation (*jhāna*
    or *samādhi*). However, unlike many spiritual contexts,
    in Buddhism it never has a metaphysical sense: Nibbāna
    is zero, not one; it is emptiness, not unity.

Two

:   Used for pairs, which may be partners---hands, eyes, man and
    wife---opponents---good vs. evil, light vs. dark, pain vs.
    pleasure---or successors---skill in entering meditation and skill in
    leaving it. It represents the dualities of the world.

Three

:   Made up of 2 + 1. It adds an extra, often spiritual, dimension to
    the worldly dualism of two. This is quite explicit in such sets as
    "gratification, drawback, and escape", and more subtly in, say,
    pleasant, painful, and neutral feelings. Three represents the
    *other*; and it is the other which contains the seed of
    transcendence.

Four

:   The most characteristic number of Buddhism, and the Book of the
    Fours is the largest of the *nipātas*. Its primary
    metaphor is the four quarters, and thus connotes totality and
    balance, most obviously in the four noble truths. Multiples of four
    have the same meaning at a higher order. Ten is similar, in that it
    is derived from the four quarters, the four intermediate quarters,
    and above and below.

Five

:   Stems from the hand, which is what we use to count; hence it divides
    into 4 + 1 (fingers and thumb) rather than 2 + 3. The most obvious
    example of this is the five "grasping" aggregates, where
    consciousness stands against the other four. Likewise in, say, the
    five faculties and powers, wisdom is the "thumb".

Six

:   Takes as its root metaphor the body: four limbs, torso, and head.
    The general sense is a "large whole", and the most prominent set is
    the six sense fields.

Seven

:   An astronomical number, derived from the lunar cycles and the
    heavenly bodies (sun + moon + five visible planets). It is used
    especially commonly in myth, and has the general sense of "the
    entire cycle of life and death". It appears in this sense in the
    story of the Bodhisatta's birth.

I believe that we can indeed discern traces of these meanings in the
Aṅguttara, and offer some examples below. In some cases,
the texts of a certain number would have been simply imported into the
collection, while in other cases the text would have been edited
specifically to create the necessary numbered set. Either way, having
some sense of these meanings gives us a perspective through which to see
the *nipātas* as meaningful wholes.

With such general meanings, and doubtless many exceptions and
contradictions, it is not possible to establish beyond doubt that the
numbers of the Aṅguttara have a symbolic meaning. If you
dislike any attempt at reading symbolic meaning, I cannot prove you
wrong. But it does, I believe, give us an approach through which to
appreciate why the redactors dealt with their diverse and complex
material in this way.

#### Thematic clusters, segues, and arcs

Despite its chaotic impression, suttas in the Aṅguttara are
rarely isolated. Most of the time they appear in *thematic clusters*
that deal with the same topic. This might be just a pair of suttas,
though it's not uncommon to find an entire *vagga* on a specific theme.
These are often closely related suttas, simply varying a few details
from one to the next. Or they may have a loose thematic thread,
featuring, for example, the same person, or group of persons. In several
cases, *vaggas* of the same name and theme appear multiple times in the
collection.

Such thematic clusters are easy to recognize; but still, it often seems
as if there is nothing that connects one cluster with the next. However,
this is not always the case. Often the shift from one cluster to another
happens through what might be called a *thematic segue*. When moving
from one thematic cluster to the next, some common element is
maintained. This might be a topic, or simply some formal feature---a
question format, a word, a syntax, etc. Such hooks help smooth the
transition from cluster to cluster.

In such cases we find that there is some element in the first cluster
\[A\], which is combined with a second element \[AB\] to form a new
cluster or extend the old one. Then the second element is combined with
something else to make yet another cluster \[BC\]. And perhaps later the
second element is dropped altogether leaving just the third \[C\], or it
is recombined with something new. If you compare the first element \[A\]
with the third \[C\] there's nothing in common. Yet the progress from
one to the other is gradual. And the frequency with which this occurs
shows that it is by no means accidental.

Similar techniques are a stock in trade of musical composition. After
introducing a motif, the composer gradually transforms and develops it.
Eventually, they might arrive at a new motif, which shares nothing in
common with the original, but from which it evolved.

A thematic segue is often a purely formal technique that says little
about the subject matter. However, with careful attention we can see
that thematic clusters, chained together with segues, sometimes evolve
over larger spans of text to create a loosely organized *thematic arc*.
Such arcs echo teaching frameworks that are familiar from elsewhere,
such as the Gradual Training. This is used, for example, to inform the
shape of the first 75 suttas of the Book of the Ones. Such arcs are by
no means as clear and formally structured as the teachings on which they
are based. Yet the progress from one topic to the next is undeniable.

Indeed, each *nipāta* can be seen as forming its own arc,
as they typically begin with basic practices, and end with realizing
Nibbāna. The repetition series that round out each
*nipāta* also have their internal arc, leading towards the
highest qualities.

#### Spaced repetition

In the Dīgha and Majjhima Nikāyas, a student
would spend a fair period of time memorizing one specific text,
rehearsing it, and---if they are a good student---inquiring and
questioning about the meaning. Only when it was mastered would they move
on to the next. In the Saṁyutta, a student would learn
dozens, even hundreds of suttas on the same topic, sharing similar
passages and ideas, and often varying little one to the other. Such
suttas may be memorized quickly, and interpretive problems often arise
at the level of the topic rather than the individual text.

But memorizing long texts, or many texts on the same subject, can get
boring, for the mind is stimulated by variety and surprise. In the
Aṅguttara, a student would learn one or two suttas on a
topic, or maybe a few more, then something else, then back to the
original topic, then a third. Now, as we have seen, various features
help keep the sequence of texts straight. But perhaps there is something
more to it: perhaps the very randomness and repetition help them to
learn.

This is a lot like the modern technique known as "spaced repetition",
commonly used for language learning. A vocabulary of words is introduced
one at a time in a random sequence. After learning one word, one moves
on to another. But the first word is then re-introduced a little later
to reinforce learning. And so it goes, with the same words coming back
again and again. In terms of the sequence from one word to the next,
everything is random. But the overall pattern is carefully optimized to
reinforce and speed up memorization.

Perhaps we could think of it like a school. The Saṁyutta is
like a school *curriculum*: everything you need to know on a topic, all
in one place. But the Aṅguttara is like a school *day*. One
class follows the other, and there is no real rhyme and reason to it.
Some things happen fairly regularly and predictably, while others seem
to just pop up at random. Despite its more chaotic nature, it works:
that's how we learn. No one would suggest that school subjects are best
mastered by first learning the science curriculum, then the maths, then
the history. Not only does the spaced repetition reinforce learning, but
it provokes us to see new and unexpected connections between things.

### The Book of the Ones

I have suggested that the number one carries with it a specific set of
connotations, notably harmony, simplicity, and supremacy. If this is
framed as an overall theme, it might be something like this: keep your
spiritual practice simple and focused to help your mind attain deep
immersion, and in that way, you can realize the supreme Dhamma. Let us
see how the Book of the Ones exemplifies these attributes.

The Book of the Ones is a rather special case in that virtually the
entire *nipāta* is constructed from fragments and
templates. The collection begins with the striking assertion that no
sight occupies a man's mind like that of a woman, or a woman's mind like
that of a man. The remainder of the exterior senses are listed for each
gender binary, making ten suttas in all for the first *vagga*. This very
much has the appearance of a single sutta divided into ten. In the Fives
([AN 5.55](https://suttacentral.net/an5.55)) we find a similar set of
statements given in a particular context, dealing with the masculine
perspective only. And in the Chinese, we find that the parallels at EA
9.7 and EA 9.8 fit the two halves of this *vagga*. This supports the
idea that these texts were originally combined to form a single sutta,
or perhaps a pair of suttas.

An even clearer example of this is provided by the three pairs of suttas
at [AN 1.76](https://suttacentral.net/an1.76) to [AN
1.81](https://suttacentral.net/an1.81). Each of the pairs follows the
same pattern, exemplified by the first pair. [AN
1.76](https://suttacentral.net/an1.76) says that the loss of relatives
is a small thing, while wisdom is the worst thing to lose. [AN
1.77](https://suttacentral.net/an1.77) presents the inverse: growth of
relatives is a small thing, for wisdom is the best thing to grow. But it
continues to round off the sutta by urging the mendicants to train to
grow in wisdom. This conclusion is lacking in the first of the pair and
is a clear sign that the text has been divided.

One should not conclude from this that the text has been assembled
haphazardly. On the contrary, we can identify a series of arcs that bind
long series of suttas together. The opening chapters are designed to
show the development of meditation, echoing the meditator's progress in
the Gradual Training.

- The first chapter, as we have seen already, deals with the restraint
  of sexuality, one of the foundations of meditation.

- The second chapter deals with the hindrances which must be abandoned
  before entering deep meditation. This is linked via a thematic segue
  from the previous chapter, the link being the phrase "I do not see a
  single thing".

- The third and fourth chapters deal with the advantages of the
  developed mind, which has been purified through the process of
  meditation: nothing brings greater happiness and benefit. They
  continue using the phrase "I do not see a single thing".

- The fifth chapter abandons the phrase "I do not see a single thing".
  Here the thematic segue is the topic of "mind" (*citta*) and its
  development.

- The fifth chapter ends with two discourses that mention the famous
  "radiant mind". These are fragments, and a more complete statement is
  found in the following suttas that start the next chapter. It is
  somewhat unusual to find such closely connected suttas broken over a
  *vagga* boundary like this. Note that the "radiant mind" is not a
  metaphysical term, and neither here nor anywhere else in the early
  Buddhist texts is the mind said to be "intrinsically" or "naturally"
  or "originally" radiant or luminous. On the contrary, the mind is
  conditioned and hence is not "intrinsically" anything at all. The
  radiant mind is simply a way of talking about meditative absorption or
  *jhāna*.

- The sixth chapter continues on the theme of absorption. However, it
  changes theme at [AN 1.56](https://suttacentral.net/an1.56)---though
  maintaining focus on "mind"---and continues by addressing the
  causality of good and bad qualities. In context, these can be
  understood as pertaining to the wisdom portion of meditation, as
  treated in the fourth of the *satipaṭṭhānas*. This series
  culminates at [AN 1.75](https://suttacentral.net/an1.75) with the
  perfection of the awakening factors, thus signifying the completion of
  the path.

A structure such as this is particularly telling as it reveals the
intent of the redactors. This thematic arc spanning 75 fragmentary
suttas does not exist in the sources at all: it is purely implied by the
choices of the redactors. Their method was to reduce the statements of
the Dhamma to their simplest meaningful elements, then reassemble them
according to the principles of the Dhamma as they understood them.

And the redactors were even more subtle than that. For not only are
these fragments assembled to form a coherent whole, but the choice of
theme was quite deliberate. Of all the doctrinal contexts in Buddhism,
it is *samādhi* or "unification of mind" where the number
one is most prominent. In starting with the Ones, the redactors were
sensitive to the use of numbers in the canon, and arranged their texts
to bring the most important "one" to the fore.

From here, the text shifts focus. As noted above, [AN
1.76--81](https://suttacentral.net/an1.71-81) deals with pairs of gain
and loss. Then from [AN 1.82](https://suttacentral.net/an1.82-97) we
have a series of texts on those things that are harmful and beneficial,
starting with the pair of negligence and diligence. While these
teachings are of course common throughout the canon, it is fitting that
they appear here to represent the Aṅguttara's special focus
on the fundamentals of a good life. Here they exemplify the aspect of
*simplicity*, helping a student to focus on just one aspect of Dhamma at
a time.

The same set of factors is treated a few times with slightly varying
templates, the final of which says that each of these harmful things
leads to the disappearance of Buddhism, while the good things lead to
its continuation. This leads us up to [AN
1.129](https://suttacentral.net/an1.98-139).

From [AN 1.130--169](https://suttacentral.net/an1.98-139), the topic of
the preservation of the Dhamma is continued, but applied to a new theme,
one that is quite distinctive of the Aṅguttara: teaching
the Dhamma. Specifically, those who present the Dhamma accurately make
much merit and preserve Buddhism, while those who distort or
misrepresent the Dhamma make bad karma and destroy Buddhism. This series
of texts displays its inner structure, as it begins with simply the
"teaching" and then continues to differentiate the Dhamma more and more
finely, especially with the introduction of the Vinaya and a rather
extensive list of technical terms for monastic discipline. It does not
take much to see that an originally simple statement could have been
drawn out by adding multiple aspects of the teaching, conveniently
giving the students of the Aṅguttara some Vinaya material
to learn.

This series of suttas grows out of the former, with the theme of
preserving Buddhism as the thematic segue. Thus we have, from [AN
1.82](https://suttacentral.net/an1.82-97) through [AN
1.169](https://suttacentral.net/an1.150-169), a second thematic arc
consisting of 88 suttas.

From [AN 1.170](https://suttacentral.net/an1.170-187) a new theme is
introduced, one that also represents a key aspect of the
Aṅguttara: persons. Buddhism is, of course, most famous for
its teachings on not-self, and its impersonal analysis of psychological
processes. But there is plenty of material throughout the suttas that
deals with persons, or character types, and much of that is in the
Aṅguttara. These texts were later assembled to form the
Abhidhamma text the Puggalapaññatti, the "Description of
Persons".

Of all the persons in Buddhism, the incomparable one is the Buddha
himself. While there is a series of Buddhas over the ages, in our age he
is unique. Hence these suttas speak of the "one person" who arises in
the world who is uniquely beneficial and transcendent. At [AN
1.187](https://suttacentral.net/an1.170-187) the Buddha's chief
disciple, Sāriputta, is praised as the one who continues to
roll the wheel of Dhamma after the Buddha. This segues into the next
series of suttas, which single out individual followers of the Buddha
for particular praise. This is a rather fascinating list, in which
appear many characters from all over the canon; not only the four
*nikāyas*, but the Vinaya and the Khuddaka as well.
Prominent monks appear in [AN
1.188--234](https://suttacentral.net/an1.188-197); nuns from [AN
1.235--247](https://suttacentral.net/an1.235-247); laymen from [AN
1.248--257](https://suttacentral.net/an1.248-257); and laywomen, from
[AN 1.258--267](https://suttacentral.net/an1.258-267). All of these
people are "number one" in their field, exemplifying the sense of "one"
as *supremacy*.

The next chapter continues the theme of "persons", enumerating various
things that are possible or impossible for various people. For example,
it is impossible for one "attained to view"---that is, a
stream-enterer---to take any condition as permanent. But from [AN
1.284--295](https://suttacentral.net/an1.278-286), once again we find a
thematic segue; the "person" vanishes and the theme of possible and
impossible is applied rather on an impersonal level: good things cannot
come from bad deeds.

This makes up the third great thematic arc in the Ones, 126 suttas from
[AN 1.170](https://suttacentral.net/an1.170-187) to [AN
1.295](https://suttacentral.net/an1.287-295). The remainder of the Ones
continues similarly, with fragmented suttas assembled along loose
thematic lines. The themes remain similar, with one difference. As the
Book draws closer to its end, the subject of Nibbāna, the
final goal of Buddhism, becomes ever more prominent. The final *vagga*
is called the "Chapter on the Deathless", and it deals directly with the
path to full awakening. Thus the sense of thematic unity that has been
evident in multiple sections of the Book of the Ones is also evident in
its overall structure, assembled by the redactors to culminate in
awakening.

### The Book of the Twos

The second *nipāta* is a kind of bridge between the "arcs
of fragments" that characterize the first *nipāta* and the
more complete suttas that become prominent in the remainder of the
Aṅguttara. It echoes and amplifies the themes of the first
*nipāta*, while also introducing new ideas.

It begins with a series of suttas that speak of the fundamental
principles of the good life: doing good and avoiding bad ([AN
2.3--4](https://suttacentral.net/an2.1-10)) and the results of deeds in
this life and the next ([AN 2.1](https://suttacentral.net/an2.1-10)).
This, I think, announces what the redactors aimed to be the chief theme
of this *nipāta*: the idea that there is a moral order in
the world, there is good and evil, and if we comprehend this we can live
our life well. The collection starts by emphasizing this fact, and the
dire consequences of ignoring it.

The second chapter builds on this, speaking on the "power of reflection"
to look back and understand this moral order, and the "power of
development" to move on from the bad and develop the good ([AN
2.11--13](https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20)). A specific example of
this is given in the case of a disciplinary measure within the
Saṅgha ([AN 2.15](https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20); cp.
[AN 2.21](https://suttacentral.net/an2.21-31)). When one mendicant
accuses another of wrongdoing, both should "reflect" on what happened
and their role in the affair, and only then can the issue be properly
healed and everyone move on. This chapter also details in various
respects the way that good and bad deeds lead to various results ([AN
2.16](https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20), [AN
2.17](https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20)), spelling out a series of
results that pertain both to this life and the next ([AN
2.18](https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20)). The Buddha then introduces
the idea of a deliberate practice: one should not only recognize these
things and reflect on them within oneself but develop the good and give
up the bad, for it is possible to do so ([AN
2.19](https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20)).

These suttas (and others) build on the teachings found in the first
*nipāta* that deal with basic principles. They conclude the
opening arc that establishes the theme of this *nipāta*:
the worldly duality of good and bad, which creates both a responsibility
and an opportunity to respond.

But it should not be thought that these chapters are fully coherent and
systematic. One finds the occasional sutta that appears quite random,
for example [AN 2.10](https://suttacentral.net/an2.1-10) on entering the
rainy season retreat; or [AN 2.60](https://suttacentral.net/an2.52-63)
on why fauns (*kimpurisa*) do not use human speech.

Meanwhile, distinct themes from the first *nipāta* are also
introduced, mixed up without clear order. [AN
2.14](https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20) mentions two ways of teaching
Dhamma---in brief and in detail---while [AN
2.20](https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20) says that the survival of
Buddhism depends on getting both the meaning and the phrasing of the
texts correct (also see [AN 2.41](https://suttacentral.net/an2.32-41)).
[AN 2.23](https://suttacentral.net/an2.21-31) reprises the theme that
one who distorts the teaching misrepresents the Buddha and contributes
to the ending of Buddhism. This applies to those who claim that things
were spoken by the Buddha when they were not.

[AN 2.24](https://suttacentral.net/an2.21-31) introduces the contrast
between the discourses that require interpretation (*neyyattha*) and
those whose meaning is explicit (*nītattha*). In some
suttas (eg. [MN 133](https://suttacentral.net/mn133)), we find that the
Buddha gives a brief statement which the mendicants do not understand,
so they seek advice on how to interpret it. In other cases a verse or
doctrinal statement is unclear and the mendicants discuss it. These
examples show that the process of discussion and analysis of the
Buddha's teaching was underway from the very beginning. This process was
eventually to be formalized as the various sets of Abhidhamma texts and
spelled out in the commentaries. But these later texts did not yet
exist, and should not be read back into the suttas.

[AN 2.31](https://suttacentral.net/an2.21-31) reintroduces another of
the themes of the first *nipāta*: meditation. The pair of
serenity (*samatha*) and discernment (or "insight",
*vipassanā*) are said to play a part in realization:
serenity develops the mind, while *vipassanā* develops
wisdom. Together they lead to the two aspects of awakening: the freedom
of heart and the freedom by wisdom.

But this is, for the moment, an isolated text, for the next series of
texts returns to the theme of persons. This theme was briefly introduced
earlier, when [AN 2.2](https://suttacentral.net/an2.1-10) contrasted the
efforts of lay folk and renunciants. [AN
2.32](https://suttacentral.net/an2.32-41) says that a good person knows
gratitude, while the bad one does not. [AN
2.33](https://suttacentral.net/an2.32-41) speaks of the strongest and
most emotional ties of gratitude, those of a child to their parents. The
Buddha says that even by carrying your parents around for the rest of
their lives, feeding and cleaning them, you cannot repay them the gift
of life. Only by establishing them in the principles of the Dhamma can
you repay them. The theme of respect for parents is further developed in
[AN 3.31](https://suttacentral.net/an3.31).

In [AN 2.35](https://suttacentral.net/an2.32-41) the Buddha tells a
brahmin that the traditional religious donation
(*dakkhiṇa*) is owed to those who are purified, that is,
the trainee and master on the path. These replace the sacrifice of the
brahmins. Next follow some teachings by disciples, in which both
Sāriputta ([AN 2.36](https://suttacentral.net/an2.32-41))
and Mahākaccāna ([AN
2.38](https://suttacentral.net/an2.32-41)) make a distinction between
inner and outer practice, while Mahākaccāna makes a shrewd
observation: householders argue about sensual pleasures, but renunciants
argue over views ([AN 2.37](https://suttacentral.net/an2.32-41)). In [AN
2.39](https://suttacentral.net/an2.32-41) the Buddha makes a rather
biting comparison between a kingdom overrun with bandits and a
Saṅgha where the good mendicants are weak, cowed into
silence. The following chapter ([AN
2.42--51](https://suttacentral.net/an2.42-51)) expands on this by
contrasting good and bad assemblies.

From assemblies as groups of people, the text revisits yet another theme
of the first *nipāta*: the Buddha as the supreme person.
Here he is paired with his worldly counterpart, the wheel-turning
emperor ([AN 2.52--55](https://suttacentral.net/an2.52-63)). Continuing
with the theme of kinds of people, [AN
2.62](https://suttacentral.net/an2.52-63) and [AN
2.63](https://suttacentral.net/an2.52-63) describe procedures in the
Saṅgha for settling disputes and living harmoniously.

The next chapter is tightly constructed on the subject of happiness
(*sukha*). It introduces the topic by contrasting the happiness of lay
people and that of renunciants, of which the latter is better ([AN
2.64](https://suttacentral.net/an2.64-76)). This continues the theme of
persons, specifically the contrast between lay folk and renunciants,
which was already stated in the second text of the
*nipāta*. Here it is combined with the topic of happiness,
which is new. A series of suttas expands on this theme, but it uses a
thematic segue to move away from the focus on "persons" and speak of
happiness in purely psychological terms more reminiscent of the
Saṁyutta.

This chapter itself forms another segue---a nested segue if you
will---to the next series of chapters, the unifying characteristic being
the tight integration of short suttas on a single pattern in a *vagga*,
returning to the kind of "vagga as sutta" that we saw in the Book of the
Ones. Chapter 8 deals with the causes for good and bad qualities;
Chapter 9 deals with various miscellaneous pairs of "things"
(*dhammā*); Chapter 10 deals with the contrast between the
fool and the astute; and Chapter 11, while a little more diverse, caps
off this series.

[AN 2.130](https://suttacentral.net/an2.130-140)--[AN
2.133](https://suttacentral.net/an2.130-140) eulogize great disciples,
reminding us of the lists of the foremost disciples in the Book of the
Ones. A few discourses then revisit the theme of good and bad people
inheriting the results of their deeds ([AN
2.134](https://suttacentral.net/an2.130-140)--[AN
2.137](https://suttacentral.net/an2.130-140)). The remainder of the
*nipāta* lists a long series of pairs of contrasted
qualities. Particularly interesting is the series at [AN
2.280--309](https://suttacentral.net/an2.280-309) where the Buddha gives
the reasons for laying down rules for monastics. Normally this is a list
of ten reasons, but here they are arranged as pairs. The final series
speaks of developing deep understanding and letting go through the pair
of serenity and discernment. Thus, despite its main focus on worldly
ethics and results, the second *nipāta*, like the first,
ends with the practices leading to awakening.

### The Book of the Threes

With this book we move on from the fragmentary assemblages of the Book
of the Ones and partly the Book of the Twos, and find more
conventionally unified suttas. Of course, this is never an absolute, as
all the books of the Aṅguttara retain extensive repetition
series. Still, the focus from now is clearly on the whole sutta; and as
a consequence, the hand of the redactors is harder to discern.

That does not mean, however, that there is a dramatic break from the
first books. On the contrary, the Book of the Threes begins with a
thematic *vagga* that focuses on the familiar contrasting pair of the
fool and the astute. The number three is represented in the qualities
that are said to characterize them. The Bālavagga (Chapter
on the Fool) corresponds to the similarly-named third and tenth chapters
of the Twos, as well as the second chapter of the Fives.

Like the Books of the Ones and Twos, this *nipāta* begins
by emphasizing the problematic situation that we are in, the tensions
and struggles of our worldly situation. The second *vagga* shifts focus
to what we can do about it.

Thus in [AN 3.13](https://suttacentral.net/an3.13) we first see a clear
example of the number three as a worldly binary and a transcendent
dimension that resolves the contradiction. This sutta speaks of one
without hope---someone afflicted by poverty and misery of station, as
well as illness of body---and a hopeful person, who looks to a bright
future. But then there is the one who has done away with hope: since
they have achieved their goal, there is nothing to look forward to.

[AN 3.14](https://suttacentral.net/an3.14) makes an important political
point: even the greatest of rulers are subject to the rule of law
(*dhamma*). Here the relevant group of three is action by body, speech,
and mind. This triad---which is pre-Buddhist---expresses one of the
fundamental principles of the Dhamma, the focus on ethical choices and
good deeds. It is found constantly throughout the Threes. Whereas a
worldly philosophy might take into consideration only a person's
external acts of body and speech, for Buddhism the mind is always the
most important. It is the mind that is ultimately responsible for what
we do and say, and it is through the mind that freedom is found. Thus
the mind here points to the transcendent dimension of escape.

The next discourse continues with the threefold division of body,
speech, and mind, giving some practical advice as to how to work for
their proper development. For the first time the Aṅguttara
ventures into narrative. It tells the story of a chariot maker of the
past, who was commissioned by the king to make a new war chariot for a
battle in six months. This is a rather striking setup: the scale of
society is so small that it is unremarkable for a king to personally
speak to a chariot-maker. And apparently, a single chariot is an
adequate military build-up for war; a war that is, politely enough,
scheduled precisely six months in advance. The small scale and low
stakes of this charming story are a strong contrast with the elaborate
and fanciful legends of the Dīgha.

The chariot-maker completes the first wheel only six days before the
battle and is urged to rush the second one. But time matters: the first
wheel is well-formed and stable, while the second wobbles and crashes.
The Buddha then goes on to identify himself as the chariot-maker. This
too is remarkable, as it is one of the very few Jātaka
stories in the four *nikāyas*. The Buddha-to-be's humble
station as a lowly chariot-maker is unusual, as usually he is said to be
a great king of the past. It's also noteworthy that his commission is
morally dubious: he is an arms manufacturer. Later the
Aṅguttara will say that trade in arms is one of the forms
of wrong livelihood ([AN 5.177](https://suttacentral.net/an5.177)). One
might argue that a chariot is not a weapon, but it is explicitly
required as a war vehicle, and today we would not hesitate to count,
say, tanks or fighter jets as weapons platforms. In the later
Jātaka collection, it is not unusual for the Bodhisatta to
break precepts or commit various acts of dubious morality; after all,
the whole point is that he is not yet perfect. Still, this adds to the
striking impression of this little tale, so much more down to earth and
realistic than the other Jātakas in the
*nikāyas*.

[AN 3.16](https://suttacentral.net/an3.16) introduces the idea of the
"guaranteed practice", which consists of three of the elements of the
Gradual Training: sense restraint, eating in moderation, and
wakefulness. These implicitly call back to the very first chapter of the
Aṅguttara, here presented in a more standard form.

One of the Aṅguttara's characteristic rhetorical devices is
to contrast the worldly with the sacred; remember how [AN
2.2](https://suttacentral.net/an2.1-10) spoke of the efforts of the lay
and the renunciant. [AN 3.19](https://suttacentral.net/an3.19) expands
this theme, comparing a shopkeeper who must work morning, noon, and
night with a mendicant who applies themselves to their meditation
morning, noon, and night. [AN 3.20](https://suttacentral.net/an3.20)
applies the same metaphor in a different way. These suttas cap off the
first arc, which deals with understanding the dangers of the world, and
working to escape from it.

The third chapter revisits the theme of "persons". It begins with a
discussion among some senior mendicants regarding who is best out of
three kinds of spiritually attained person; or in other words, who has
best implemented the practice encouraged in the first two chapters ([AN
3.21](https://suttacentral.net/an3.21)). An interesting comparison is
made between the treatment of illness and providing spiritual
assistance: you can't always help, but you should at least try ([AN
3.22](https://suttacentral.net/an3.22)).

Several suttas in the Threes share a pattern where the first item is a
foundation, the second is the realization of the four noble truths, and
the third is full awakening. This first appears at [AN
3.12](https://suttacentral.net/an3.12), and is applied in different ways
in [AN 3.24](https://suttacentral.net/an3.24) and [AN
3.25](https://suttacentral.net/an3.25).

Returning to the theme of meditative immersion with which the entire
collection started, we are introduced to an intriguing teaching that
reappears multiple times in the Aṅguttara, but nowhere else
in the canon ([AN 3.32](https://suttacentral.net/an3.32), [AN
10.6](https://suttacentral.net/an10.6), [AN
10.7](https://suttacentral.net/an10.7), [AN
11.7](https://suttacentral.net/an11.7), [AN
11.18](https://suttacentral.net/an11.18)--[AN
11.21](https://suttacentral.net/an11.21)). It begins with a question:
could it be that a mendicant might attain a state of immersion that is
free of all ego and conceit? Normally it is understood that the
meditative absorptions are shared between ordinary people and
enlightened beings on the path. The perfected ones are distinguished by
having let go the cause of suffering, not because they have attained
some special state of meditation. But these suttas, with their striking
note of wonder, imply that there is a special meditative state attained
only by the perfected ones.

This discourse is also distinguished by the fact that it finishes by
quoting a verse currently included in the Sutta Nipāta and
even correctly names the chapter, the "The Way to the Beyond". It is not
at all obvious that the verse was originally intended to refer to a
state of meditation. This shows that free and imaginative readings of
suttas were found even in the earliest times.

The next discourse ([AN 3.33](https://suttacentral.net/an3.33))
continues with the theme of going beyond ego and conceit, and it too
quotes from "The Way to the Beyond". But it starts with the Buddha in
what appears to be an uncharacteristically despondent mood, saying that
whether he teaches in brief or in detail---harking back to [AN
2.14](https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20)---it's hard to find anyone who
understands.

[AN 3.35](https://suttacentral.net/an3.35) narrates a personal encounter
with a fellow by the name of Hatthaka, who came across the Buddha
meditating near his hometown of Āḷavī. He asks if the
Buddha slept well, considering the harshness of his outdoor living. The
Buddha replies that he is one of those who sleep well in the world, as
he is rid of the greed, hate, and delusion that disturb people in their
sleep.

This is the second time this classic triad appears in the Threes. They
first appeared in the previous sutta, [AN
3.34](https://suttacentral.net/an3.34), as the source of deeds, and will
recur in this sense in multiple suttas in this *nipāta*.
Like the triad of body, speech, and mind, they can be seen to exemplify
the 2 + 1 pattern. Greed and hate are a codependent pair, the ugly
opposites. Delusion underlies them both; but at the same time, the
counterpart of delusion is wisdom, and it is through wisdom that
transcendence is possible.

This narrative mood ventures into mythology in the next discourse, which
gives the Buddhist account of the god Yama, lord of the dead. While one
might expect a death god to be fearsome, here he takes a decidedly
Buddhist approach to the afterlife. When the departed are brought to
Yama, he neither judges nor punishes. Rather, he asks the departed
whether he took heed of the messengers sent by the gods: an old person,
a sick person, and a corpse. These, of course, are three of the four
divine messengers seen by the Bodhisattva before he went forth
(canonically found in the life of Vipassī; see [DN
14](https://suttacentral.net/dn14)). When the departed one replies that
he took no heed, Yama castigates him for his negligence and then falls
silent. The departed is dragged off to endure the sufferings of hell,
here recounted in a briefer form than [MN
129](https://suttacentral.net/mn129) and [MN
130](https://suttacentral.net/mn130). Yama goes on to lament the pitiful
state of mortals, including himself and wishes he could be reborn as a
human and practice Buddhism.

The mythological mood continues in the next couple of suttas ([AN
3.37](https://suttacentral.net/an3.37), [AN
3.38](https://suttacentral.net/an3.38)), which introduce a new topic
that will be very important for the Aṅguttara; namely, the
*uposatha* or "sabbath". This was a special "holy day" for religious
observance observed weekly or on certain special days. The ministers of
the Four Great Kings survey the earth on such days to see if people are
honoring their betters and doing good. If they are, they rejoice, for
they know that such people will be reborn in heaven to swell the hosts
of the gods, whereas if they are not they fear the hosts of the demons
will increase. This will of course have serious military implications in
the ongoing war between the two.

The next couple of suttas deal with renunciation, first as the Buddha's
recollection of his delicate upbringing ([AN
3.39](https://suttacentral.net/an3.39)), then as a reflection for how a
renunciate is to reflect with integrity on their choices ([AN
3.40](https://suttacentral.net/an3.40)). [AN
3.41](https://suttacentral.net/an3.41) and [AN
3.42](https://suttacentral.net/an3.42) look at the other side of the
coin, the qualities that make merit for a lay donor, especially faith
and generosity as well as the desire to learn. Learning is taken up as
the theme of the next two suttas ([AN
3.43](https://suttacentral.net/an3.43) and [AN
3.44](https://suttacentral.net/an3.44)). Then the themes of generosity,
faith, and the worthy spiritual life that make merit fruitful are
revisited ([AN 3.45](https://suttacentral.net/an3.45), [AN
3.46](https://suttacentral.net/an3.46), [AN
3.48](https://suttacentral.net/an3.48)). Mendicants are then urged to be
diligent ([AN 3.49](https://suttacentral.net/an3.49)) and the nature of
bad mendicants is disclosed ([AN
3.50](https://suttacentral.net/an3.50)). Taken together, this series of
12 suttas can be read as a small thematic arc on the relation between
lay folk and renunciants, the need for both to have integrity and the
proper sense of values in their sphere, and the mutual support of each
other through generosity with material things and of teachings.

Next begins a new *vagga*, "On Brahmins", which as one might expect,
depicts the Buddha in conversation with brahmins. In [AN
3.51](https://suttacentral.net/an3.51) and [AN
3.52](https://suttacentral.net/an3.52), the Buddha is approached by two
brahmins, who confess that they have not lived a good life, and now, in
their dotage, seek for help. The Buddha acknowledges the brevity of life
and urges restraint of body, speech, and mind. [AN
3.53](https://suttacentral.net/an3.53) has the Buddha speaking to
another brahmin on how the Dhamma is to be realized in this very life.
He gives a similar teaching to a wanderer ([AN
3.54](https://suttacentral.net/an3.54)) and to the brahmin
Jāṇussoṇi ([AN 3.55](https://suttacentral.net/an3.55)).
That the Buddha's teaching may be realized in this life is a stock
characteristic of the Dhamma (*sandiṭṭhiko
akāliko*), but it is easy to overlook how directly this was
a rebuke of pre-existing religious traditions. They looked forward to
rewards in the future---whether a heavenly rebirth or the eventual
annihilation of suffering---but the Buddha, while not denying the
reality and importance of future fruits, refocused spiritual life on the
present.

[AN 3.56](https://suttacentral.net/an3.56) gives a different kind of
teaching to a brahmin. In a message with a special poignancy in our
troubled times, the Buddha explains why civilizations collapse, namely,
unbridled greed. In [AN 3.57](https://suttacentral.net/an3.57) the
Buddha refutes the wanderer Vacchagotta's accusation that he only
encourages giving to his followers. When the brahmin
Tikaṇṇa ("Three-ear") praises true brahmins, the Buddha
responds with his redefinition of a brahmin, rejecting the value of
birth and Vedic learning, and giving the second part of the Gradual
Training, starting with the absorptions ([AN
3.58](https://suttacentral.net/an3.58); [AN
3.59](https://suttacentral.net/an3.59) is similar). In [AN
3.60](https://suttacentral.net/an3.60), the Buddha not only rejects the
value of the Vedic sacrifice, but he also shows that by teaching Dhamma
one can benefit many more people.

The seventh *vagga* is titled the "Great Chapter", and it introduces a
series of discourses on a larger scale. It begins with a thematic segue;
[AN 3.61](https://suttacentral.net/an3.61) continues the theme of the
relation between Buddhist and non-Buddhist theories, but it does so as a
straight doctrinal discourse to the mendicants, rather than as an
interfaith dialogue. This magnificent discourse offers an important
framing of dependent origination and it deserves detailed study. This
Great Chapter is unified by the length of the sutta rather than by
subject; however several other suttas deal with non-Buddhist philosophy
and relations ([AN 3.64](https://suttacentral.net/an3.64), [AN
3.68](https://suttacentral.net/an3.68), [AN
3.70](https://suttacentral.net/an3.70)), including the famous
Kālāma Sutta ([AN 3.65](https://suttacentral.net/an3.65);
also [AN 3.66](https://suttacentral.net/an3.66)).

Here I will end my analysis, as I think enough examples have been given
to illustrate both the connectedness and the chaos of this collection.
Hopefully, the reader can find their way from here, and not feel so
bewildered by the sudden shifts and changes they encounter.

### A Brief Textual History

The Aṅguttara Nikāya was edited by R. Morris
(vols. 1 and 2) and E. Hardy (vols 3--5) based on manuscripts in
Sinhalese and Burmese scripts; Hardy also made use of the then
recently-published royal Thai edition. It was published in Latin script
by the Pali Text Society from 1885 to 1900. Indexes by M. Hunt and Mrs.
C.A.F. Rhys Davids were added in 1910. The first translation followed in
1932--36 by F.L. Woodward (vols. 1, 2, and 5) and E.M. Hare (vols. 3 and
4) under the title *The Book of the Gradual Sayings*.

As was the case with the Majjhima and Saṁyutta, several
disparate individual suttas from the Aṅguttara were
published in book form or the web. However, a complete new translation
had to wait for Bhikkhu Bodhi to complete his work on the
Saṁyutta Nikāya. As described in the
introduction to his translation, in the late 1990s Bhikkhu Bodhi
collected Nyanaponika Thera's four-part series of Wheel booklets into a
single volume for the International Sacred Literature Trust as *An
Aṅguttara Nikāya Anthology*. He then added
sixty more suttas and published a total of 208 suttas as *The Numerical
Discourses of the Buddha: An Anthology of Suttas from the
Aṅguttara Nikāya* with AltaMira Press in 1999.
In 2012 he completed the full translation, which was published as *The
Numerical Discourses of the Buddha* through Wisdom Publications. His
Introduction was even more extensive than his previous works; less
technical than the Saṁyutta introduction, the bulk of it
focused on an overview of the teachings found in the
Aṅguttara. As with his previous translations, this work
constituted a major leap forward in accuracy and readability,
introducing the Aṅguttara to a new generation.

Where the Pali was unclear I frequently referred to the earlier work of
Bodhi, and rarely to Woodward/Hare and various translations of specific
texts. An article by Tse-fu Kuan ()---*Some Reflections on Translating
the Pali Texts: Literary Conventions, Buddhist Thought, Cultural
Background and Textual History*, 2019, Acta Orientalia Academiae
Scientiarum Hungaricae, vol. 72 (1), pp. 1--23---provided helpful
corrections in several passages.

## Acknowledgements

I remember with gratitude all those from whom I have learned the Dhamma,
especially Ajahn Brahm and Bhikkhu Bodhi, the two monks who more than
anyone else showed me the depth, meaning, and practical value of the
Suttas.

Special thanks to Dustin and Keiko Cheah and family, who sponsored my
stay in Qi Mei while I made this translation.

Thanks also for Blake Walshe, who provided essential software support
for my translation work.

Throughout the process of translation, I have frequently sought feedback
and suggestions from the SuttaCentral community on our forum, "Discuss
and Discover". I want to thank all those who have made suggestions and
contributed to my understanding, as well as to the moderators who have
made the forum possible. These translations were significantly improved
due to the careful work of my proofreaders: Ayyā
Pāsādā, John and Lynn Kelly, and Derek Sola. Special thanks
are due to Sabbamittā, a true friend of all, who has
tirelessly and precisely checked my work.

Finally my everlasting thanks to all those people, far too many to
mention, who have supported SuttaCentral, and those who have supported
my life as a monastic. None of this would be possible without you.
