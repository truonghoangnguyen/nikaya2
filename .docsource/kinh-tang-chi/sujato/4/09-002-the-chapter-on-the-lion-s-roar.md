# The Chapter on the Lion's Roar

### AN 9.11 Sāriputta's Lion's Roar  *Sīhanādasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

Then Venerable Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat
down to one side, and said to him, "Sir, I have completed the rainy
season residence at Sāvatthī. I wish to depart to wander
the countryside."

"Please, Sāriputta, go at your convenience." Then
Sāriputta got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully
circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.

And then, not long after Sāriputta had left, a certain monk
said to the Buddha, "Sir, Venerable Sāriputta attacked me
and left without saying sorry."

So the Buddha addressed one of the monks, "Please, monk, in my name tell
Sāriputta that the teacher summons him."

"Yes, sir," that monk replied. He went to Sāriputta and
said to him, "Reverend Sāriputta, the teacher summons you."

"Yes, reverend," Sāriputta replied.

Now at that time the Venerables Mahāmoggallāna and Ānanda,
taking a latchkey, went from dwelling to dwelling, saying: "Come forth,
venerables! Come forth, venerables! Now Venerable Sāriputta
will roar his lion's roar in the presence of the Buddha!"

Then Venerable Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, and
sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:

"Sāriputta, one of your spiritual companions has made this
complaint: 'Venerable Sāriputta attacked me and left
without saying sorry.'"

"Sir, someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well
attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry.

Suppose they were to toss both clean and unclean things on the earth,
like feces, urine, spit, pus, and blood. The earth isn't horrified,
repelled, and disgusted because of this. In the same way, I live with a
heart like the earth, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and
ill will. Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might
well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying
sorry.

Suppose they were to wash both clean and unclean things in water, like
feces, urine, spit, pus, and blood. The water isn't horrified, repelled,
and disgusted because of this. In the same way, I live with a heart like
water, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well
attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry.

Suppose a fire were to burn both clean and unclean things, like feces,
urine, spit, pus, and blood. The fire isn't horrified, repelled, and
disgusted because of this. In the same way, I live with a heart like
fire, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well
attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry.

Suppose the wind was to blow on both clean and unclean things, like
feces, urine, spit, pus, and blood. The wind isn't horrified, repelled,
and disgusted because of this. In the same way, I live with a heart like
the wind, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well
attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry.

Suppose a rag was to wipe up both clean and unclean things, like feces,
urine, spit, pus, and blood. The rag isn't horrified, repelled, and
disgusted because of this. In the same way, I live with a heart like a
rag, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well
attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry.

Suppose a boy or girl of a corpse-worker tribe, holding a pot and clad
in rags, were to enter a town or village. They'd enter with a humble
mind. In the same way, I live with a heart like a boy or girl of a
corpse-worker tribe, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and
ill will. Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might
well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying
sorry.

Suppose there was a bull with his horns cut, gentle, well tamed and well
trained. He'd wander from street to street and square to square without
hurting anyone with his feet or horns. In the same way, I live with a
heart like a bull with horns cut, abundant, expansive, limitless, free
of enmity and ill will. Someone who had not established mindfulness of
the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave
without saying sorry.

Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of
adornments, and had bathed their head. If the carcass of a snake or a
dog or a human were hung around their neck, they'd be horrified,
repelled, and disgusted. In the same way, I'm horrified, repelled, and
disgusted by this rotten body. Someone who had not established
mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual
companions and leave without saying sorry.

Suppose someone was to carry around a bowl of fat that was leaking and
oozing from holes and cracks. In the same way, I carry around this body
that's leaking and oozing from holes and cracks. Someone who had not
established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their
spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry."

Then that monk rose from his seat, placed his robe over one shoulder,
bowed with his head at the Buddha's feet, and said, "I have made a
mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to speak ill
of Venerable Sāriputta with an incorrect, hollow, false,
untruthful claim. Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I
will restrain myself in future."

"Indeed, monk, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and
unskillful of you to act in that way. But since you have recognized your
mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it.
For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake
for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the
future."

Then the Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta,
"Sāriputta, forgive that futile man before his head
explodes into seven pieces right here."

"I will pardon that venerable if he asks me: 'May the venerable please
pardon me too.'"

### AN 9.12 With Residue  *Saupādisesasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and,
taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. Then
it occurred to him, "It's too early to wander for alms in
Sāvatthī. Why don't I visit the monastery of the wanderers
of other religions?" Then he went to the monastery of the wanderers of
other religions and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. When
the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one
side.

Now at that time while those wanderers of other religions were sitting
together this discussion came up among them:

"Reverends, no-one who dies with residue is exempt from hell, the animal
realm, or the ghost realm. They're not exempt from places of loss, bad
places, the underworld."

Sāriputta neither approved nor dismissed that statement of
the wanderers of other religions. He got up from his seat, thinking, "I
will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself."

Then Sāriputta wandered for alms in Sāvatthī.
After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha,
bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.

"Sāriputta, these foolish, incompetent wanderers following
other religions: who are they to know whether someone has residue or
not?

There are these nine people who, dying with residue, are exempt from
hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They're exempt from places
of loss, bad places, the underworld. What nine?

There's a person who has fulfilled ethics and immersion, but has limited
wisdom. With the ending of the five lower fetters they're extinguished
between one life and the next. This is the first person ...

Furthermore, there's a person who has fulfilled ethics and immersion,
but has limited wisdom. With the ending of the five lower fetters
they're extinguished upon landing. This is the second person ...

With the ending of the five lower fetters they're extinguished without
extra effort. This is the third person ...

With the ending of the five lower fetters they're extinguished with
extra effort. This is the fourth person ...

With the ending of the five lower fetters they head upstream, going to
the Akaniṭṭha realm. This is the fifth person ...

Furthermore, there's a person who has fulfilled ethics, but has limited
immersion and wisdom. With the ending of three fetters, and the
weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, they're a once-returner. They
come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. This
is the sixth person ...

Furthermore, there's a person who has fulfilled ethics, but has limited
immersion and wisdom. With the ending of three fetters, they're a
one-seeder. They will be reborn just one time in a human existence, then
make an end of suffering. This is the seventh person ...

Furthermore, there's a person who has fulfilled ethics, but has limited
immersion and wisdom. With the ending of three fetters, they go from
family to family. They will transmigrate between two or three families
and then make an end of suffering. This is the eighth person ...

Furthermore, there's a person who has fulfilled ethics, but has limited
immersion and wisdom. With the ending of three fetters, they have at
most seven rebirths. They will transmigrate at most seven times among
gods and humans and then make an end of suffering. This is the ninth
person ...

These foolish, incompetent wanderers following other religions: who are
they to know whether someone has residue or not? These are the nine
people who, dying with residue, are exempt from hell, the animal realm,
and the ghost realm. They're exempt from places of loss, bad places, the
underworld.

Up until now, Sāriputta, I have not felt the need to give
this exposition of the teaching to the monks, nuns, laymen, and
laywomen. Why is that? For I didn't want those who heard it to introduce
negligence. However, I have spoken it in order to answer your question."

### AN 9.13 With Koṭṭhita  *Koṭṭhikasutta*

Then Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita went up to Venerable
Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him. When the
greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and
said to Sāriputta:

"Reverend Sāriputta, is the spiritual life lived under the
Buddha for this purpose: 'May deeds to be experienced in this life be
experienced by me in lives to come'?"

"Certainly not, reverend."

"Then is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose:
'May deeds to be experienced in lives to come be experienced by me in
this life'?"

"Certainly not."

"Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose: 'May
deeds to be experienced as pleasant be experienced by me as painful'?"

"Certainly not."

"Then is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose:
'May deeds to be experienced as painful be experienced by me as
pleasant'?"

"Certainly not."

"Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose: 'May
deeds to be experienced when ripe be experienced by me when unripe'?"

"Certainly not."

"Then is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose:
'May deeds to be experienced when unripe be experienced by me when
ripe'?"

"Certainly not."

"Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose: 'May
deeds to be experienced a lot be experienced by me a little'?"

"Certainly not."

"Then is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose:
'May deeds to be experienced a little be experienced by me a lot'?"

"Certainly not."

"Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose: 'May
deeds to be experienced by me be not experienced'?"

"Certainly not."

"Then is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for this purpose:
'May deeds not to be experienced be experienced'?"

"Certainly not."

"Reverend Sāriputta, when you were asked whether the
spiritual life was lived under the Buddha so that deeds to be
experienced in this life are experienced in lives to come, you said,
'Certainly not'.

When you were asked whether the spiritual life was lived under the
Buddha so that deeds to be experienced in lives to come are experienced
in this life ...

deeds to be experienced as pleasant are experienced as painful ...

deeds to be experienced as painful are experienced as pleasant ...

deeds to be experienced when ripe are experienced when unripe ...

deeds to be experienced when unripe are experienced when ripe ...

deeds to be experienced a lot are experienced a little ...

deeds to be experienced a little are experienced a lot ...

deeds to be experienced are not experienced ...

When you were asked whether the spiritual life was lived under the
Buddha so that deeds not to be experienced are experienced, you said,
'Certainly not.' Then what exactly is the purpose of leading the
spiritual life under the Buddha?"

"Reverend, the spiritual life is lived under the Buddha to know, see,
attain, realize, and comprehend that which is unknown, unseen,
unattained, unrealized, and uncomprehended."

"But what is the unknown, unseen, unattained, unrealized, and
uncomprehended?"

"'This is suffering.' ... 'This is the origin of suffering.' ... 'This
is the cessation of suffering.' ... 'This is the practice that leads to
the cessation of suffering.' ... This is the unknown, unseen,
unattained, unrealized, and uncomprehended. The spiritual life is lived
under the Buddha to know, see, attain, realize, and comprehend this."

### AN 9.14 With Samiddhi  *Samiddhisutta*

Then Venerable Samiddhi went up to Venerable Sāriputta,
bowed, and sat to one side. Venerable Sāriputta said to
him:

"Samiddhi, based on what do thoughts arise in a person?"

"Based on name and form, sir."

"Where do they become diversified?"

"In the elements."

"What is their origin?"

"Contact is their origin."

"What is their meeting place?"

"Feeling is their meeting place."

"What is their chief?"

"Immersion is their chief."

"What is their ruler?"

"Mindfulness is their ruler."

"What is their overseer?"

"Wisdom is their overseer."

"What is their core?"

"Freedom is their core."

"What is their culmination?"

"They culminate in freedom from death."

"Samiddhi, when you were asked what is the basis on which thoughts arise
in a person, you answered 'name and form'. When you were asked ... what
is their culmination, you answered 'freedom from death'. Good, good,
Samiddhi! It's good that you answered each question. But don't get
conceited because of that."

### AN 9.15 The Simile of the Boil  *Gaṇḍasutta*

"Mendicants, suppose there was a boil that was many years old. And that
boil had nine orifices that were continually open wounds. Whatever oozed
out of them would be filthy, stinking, and disgusting. Whatever leaked
out them would be filthy, stinking, and disgusting.

'Boil' is a term for this body made up of the four principal states,
produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable
to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and
destruction. And that boil has nine orifices that are continually open
wounds. Whatever oozes out of them is filthy, stinking, and disgusting.
Whatever leaks out of them is filthy, stinking, and disgusting. So,
mendicants, have no illusion about this body."

<!--pg-->
### AN 9.16 Perceptions  *Saññāsutta*

"Mendicants, these nine perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are
very fruitful and beneficial. They culminate in freedom from death and
end in freedom from death. What nine? The perceptions of ugliness,
death, repulsiveness of food, dissatisfaction with the whole world,
impermanence, suffering in impermanence, not-self in suffering, giving
up, and fading away. These nine perceptions, when developed and
cultivated, are very fruitful and beneficial. They culminate in freedom
from death and end in freedom from death."

<!--pg-->
### AN 9.17 Families  *Kulasutta*

"Mendicants, visiting a family with nine factors is not worthwhile, or
if you've already arrived, sitting down is not worthwhile. What nine?
They don't politely rise, bow, or offer a seat. They hide what they
have. Even when they have much they give little. Even when they have
fine things they give coarse things. They give carelessly, not
carefully. They don't sit nearby to listen to the teachings. When you're
speaking, they don't listen well. Visiting a family with these nine
factors is not worthwhile, or if you've already arrived, sitting down is
not worthwhile.

Visiting a family with nine factors is worthwhile, or if you've already
arrived, sitting down is worthwhile. What nine? They politely rise, bow,
and offer a seat. They don't hide what they have. When they have much
they give much. When they have refined things they give refined things.
They give carefully, not carelessly. They sit nearby to listen to the
teachings. When you're speaking, they listen well. Visiting a family
with these nine factors is worthwhile, or if you've already arrived,
sitting down is worthwhile."

<!--pg-->
### AN 9.18 The Sabbath with Nine Factors  *Navaṅguposathasutta*

"Mendicants, the observance of the sabbath with its nine factors is very
fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful. And how should it be
observed?

It's when a noble disciple reflects: 'As long as they live, the
perfected ones give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and
the sword. They are scrupulous and kind, and live full of sympathy for
all living beings. I, too, for this day and night will give up killing
living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. I'll be scrupulous
and kind, and live full of sympathy for all living beings. I will
observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.'
This is its first factor. ...

'As long as they live, the perfected ones give up high and luxurious
beds. They sleep in a low place, either a small bed or a straw mat. I,
too, for this day and night will give up high and luxurious beds. I'll
sleep in a low place, either a small bed or a straw mat. I will observe
the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.' This is
its eighth factor.

They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to
the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above,
below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love
to the whole world---abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and
ill will. This is its ninth factor.

The observance of the sabbath with its nine factors in this way is very
fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful."

<!--pg-->
### AN 9.19 A Deity  *Devatāsutta*

"Mendicants, tonight, several glorious deities, lighting up the entire
Jeta's Grove, came to me, bowed, stood to one side, and said to me:
'Sir, formerly when we were human beings, renunciates came to our homes.
We politely rose for them, but we didn't bow. And so, having not
fulfilled our duty, full of remorse and regret, we were reborn in a
lesser realm.'

Then several other deities came to me and said: 'Sir, formerly when we
were human beings, renunciates came to our homes. We politely rose for
them and bowed, but we didn't offer a seat. And so, having not fulfilled
our duty, full of remorse and regret, we were reborn in a lesser realm.'

Then several other deities came to me and said: 'Sir, formerly when we
were human beings, renunciates came to our homes. We politely rose for
them, bowed, and offered a seat, but we didn't share as best we could.
...'

'... we didn't sit nearby to listen to the teachings. ...'

'... we didn't actively listen to the teachings. ...'

'... we didn't memorize the teachings. ...'

'... we didn't examine the meaning of teachings we'd memorized. ...'

'... not having understood the meaning and the teaching, we didn't
practice accordingly. And so, having not fulfilled our duty, full of
remorse and regret, we were reborn in a lesser realm.'

Then several other deities came to me and said: 'Sir, formerly when we
were human beings, renunciates came to our homes. We politely rose,
bowed, and offered them a seat. We shared as best we could. We sat
nearby to listen to the teachings, lent an ear, memorized them, and
examined their meaning. Understanding the teaching and the meaning we
practiced accordingly. And so, having fulfilled our duty, free of
remorse and regret, we were reborn in a superior realm.'

Here, mendicants, are these roots of trees, and here are these empty
huts. Practice absorption, mendicants! Don't be negligent! Don't regret
it later, like those former deities."

### AN 9.20 About Velāma  *Velāmasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Then the householder
Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to
one side. The Buddha said to him, "Householder, I wonder whether your
family gives gifts?"

"It does, sir. But only coarse gruel with pickles."

"Householder, someone might give a gift that's either coarse or fine.
But they give it carelessly, thoughtlessly, not with their own hand.
They give the dregs, and they give without consideration for
consequences. Then wherever the result of any such gift manifests, their
mind doesn't incline toward enjoyment of nice food, clothes, vehicles,
or the five refined kinds of sensual stimulation. And their children,
wives, bondservants, servants, and workers don't want to listen to them.
They don't actively listen or try to understand. Why is that? Because
that is the result of deeds done carelessly.

Someone might give a gift that's either coarse or fine. And they give it
carefully, thoughtfully, with their own hand. They don't give the dregs,
and they give with consideration for consequences. Then wherever the
result of any such gift manifests, their mind inclines toward enjoyment
of nice food, clothes, vehicles, or the five refined kinds of sensual
stimulation. And their children, wives, bondservants, servants, and
workers want to listen. They actively listen and try to understand. Why
is that? Because that is the result of deeds done carefully.

Once upon a time, householder, there was a brahmin named
Velāma. He gave the following gift, a great offering.
84,000 gold cups filled with silver. 84,000 silver cups filled with
gold. 84,000 bronze cups filled with gold coins. 84,000 elephants with
gold adornments and banners, covered with snow gold netting. 84,000
chariots upholstered with the hide of lions, tigers, and leopards, and
cream rugs, with gold adornments and banners, covered with snow gold
netting. 84,000 milk cows with silken reins and bronze pails. 84,000
maidens bedecked with jeweled earrings. 84,000 couches spread with
woolen covers---shag-piled, pure white, or embroidered with
flowers---and spread with a fine deer hide, with canopies above and red
pillows at both ends. 8,400,000,000 fine cloths of linen, cotton, silk,
and wool. And who can say how much food, drink, snacks, meals,
refreshments, and beverages? It seemed like an overflowing river.

Householder, you might think: 'Surely the brahmin Velāma
must have been someone else at that time?' But you should not see it
like this. I myself was the brahmin Velāma at that time. I
gave that gift, a great offering. But at that event there was no-one
worthy of a religious donation, and no-one to purify the religious
donation.

It would be more fruitful to feed one person accomplished in view than
that great offering of Velāma.

It would be more fruitful to feed one once-returner than a hundred
persons accomplished in view.

It would be more fruitful to feed one non-returner than a hundred
once-returners.

It would be more fruitful to feed one perfected one than a hundred
non-returners.

It would be more fruitful to feed one Independent Buddha than a hundred
perfected ones.

It would be more fruitful to feed one Realized One, a perfected one, a
fully awakened Buddha than a hundred Independent Buddhas.

It would be more fruitful to feed the mendicant Saṅgha
headed by the Buddha than to feed one Realized One, a perfected one, a
fully awakened Buddha.

It would be more fruitful to build a dwelling especially for the
Saṅgha of the four quarters than to feed the mendicant
Saṅgha headed by the Buddha.

It would be more fruitful to go for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching,
and the Saṅgha with a confident heart than to build a
dwelling for the Saṅgha of the four quarters.

It would be more fruitful to undertake the training rules---not to kill
living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or consume beer,
wine, and liquor intoxicants---than to go for refuge to the Buddha, the
teaching, and the Saṅgha with a confident heart.

It would be more fruitful to develop a heart of love---even just as long
as it takes to pull a cow's udder---than to undertake the training
rules.

It would be more fruitful to develop the perception of
impermanence---even for as long as a finger-snap---than to do all of
these things, including developing a heart of love for as long as it
takes to pull a cow's udder."
