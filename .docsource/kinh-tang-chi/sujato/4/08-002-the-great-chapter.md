# The Great Chapter

### AN 8.11 At Verañjā  *Verañjasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying in
Verañjā at the root of a neem tree dedicated to
Naḷeru. Then the brahmin Verañja went up to
the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and
polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the
Buddha:

"Mister Gotama, I have heard that the ascetic Gotama doesn't bow to old
brahmins, the elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have
reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or
offer them a seat. And this is indeed the case, for Mister Gotama does
not bow to old brahmins, elderly and senior, who are advanced in years
and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their
presence or offer them a seat. This is not appropriate, Mister Gotama."

"Brahmin, I don't see anyone in this world---with its gods,
Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics
and brahmins, its gods and humans---for whom I should bow down or rise
up or offer a seat. If the Realized One bowed down or rose up or offered
a seat to anyone, their head would explode!"

"Mister Gotama lacks taste."

"There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I lack
taste. For the Realized One has given up taste for sights, sounds,
smells, tastes, and touches. It's cut off at the root, made like a palm
stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. In this sense you
could rightly say that I lack taste. But that's not what you're talking
about."

"Mister Gotama is indelicate."

"There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I'm
indelicate. For the Realized One has given up delight in sights, sounds,
smells, tastes, and touches. It's cut off at the root, made like a palm
stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. In this sense you
could rightly say that I'm indelicate. But that's not what you're
talking about."

"Mister Gotama is a teacher of inaction."

"There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I'm a
teacher of inaction. For I teach inaction regarding bad bodily, verbal,
and mental conduct, and the many kinds of unskillful things. In this
sense you could rightly say that I'm a teacher of inaction. But that's
not what you're talking about."

"Mister Gotama is a teacher of annihilationism."

"There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I'm a
teacher of annihilationism. For I teach the annihilation of greed, hate,
and delusion, and the many kinds of unskillful things. In this sense you
could rightly say that I'm a teacher of annihilationism. But that's not
what you're talking about."

"Mister Gotama is disgusted."

"There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I'm
disgusted. For I'm disgusted by bad conduct by way of body, speech, and
mind, and by attainment of the many kinds of unskillful things. In this
sense you could rightly say that I'm disgusted. But that's not what
you're talking about."

"Mister Gotama is an exterminator."

"There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I'm an
exterminator. For I teach the extermination of greed, hate, and
delusion, and the many kinds of unskillful things. In this sense you
could rightly say that I'm an exterminator. But that's not what you're
talking about."

"Mister Gotama is a mortifier."

"There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I'm a
mortifier. For I say that bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind
should be mortified. I say that a mortifier is someone who has given up
unskillful qualities that should be mortified. They've cut them off at
the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they're
unable to arise in the future. The Realized One is someone who has given
up unskillful qualities that should be mortified. He has cut them off at
the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they're
unable to arise in the future. In this sense you could rightly say that
I'm a mortifier. But that's not what you're talking about."

"Mister Gotama is immature."

"There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I'm
immature. I say that an immature person is someone who has given up
future wombs and rebirth into a new state of existence. They've cut them
off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that
they're unable to arise in the future. The Realized One has given up
future wombs and rebirth into a new state of existence. He has cut them
off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that
they're unable to arise in the future. In this sense you could rightly
say that I'm immature. But that's not what you're talking about.

Suppose, brahmin, there was a chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs.
And she properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated. Now, the
chick that is first to break out of the eggshell with its claws and beak
and hatch safely: should that be called the eldest or the youngest?"

"Mister Gotama, that should be called the eldest. For it is the eldest
among them."

"In the same way, in this population lost in ignorance, swaddled in
their shells, I alone have broken open the egg of ignorance and realized
the supreme perfect awakening. So, brahmin, I am the eldest and the
first in the world.

My energy was roused up and unflagging, my mindfulness was established
and lucid, my body was tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind was
immersed in samādhi. Quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first
absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while
placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind
and keeping it connected were stilled, I entered and remained in the
second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion,
with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and
keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, I entered and
remained in the third absorption, where I meditated with equanimity,
mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble
ones declare, 'Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.' With the
giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and
sadness, I entered and remained in the fourth absorption, without
pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.

When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this---purified,
bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and
imperturbable---I extended it toward recollection of past lives. I
recollected many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four,
five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a
hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons
of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and
expanding. I remembered: 'There, I was named this, my clan was that, I
looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and
pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place
I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was
that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt
pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away
from that place I was reborn here.' And so I recollected my many kinds
of past lives, with features and details.

This was the first knowledge, which I achieved in the first watch of the
night. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was
destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent,
keen, and resolute. This was my first breaking out, like a chick
breaking out of the eggshell.

When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this---purified,
bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and
imperturbable---I extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth
of sentient beings. With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I
saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn---inferior and
superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I
understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds:
'These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They
denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out
of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they're
reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear
beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They
never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to
act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death,
they're reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.' And so, with
clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings
passing away and being reborn---inferior and superior, beautiful and
ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings
are reborn according to their deeds.

This was the second knowledge, which I achieved in the middle watch of
the night. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was
destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent,
keen, and resolute. This was my second breaking out, like a chick
breaking out of the eggshell.

When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this---purified,
bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and
imperturbable---I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of
defilements. I truly understood: 'This is suffering' ... 'This is the
origin of suffering' ... 'This is the cessation of suffering' ... 'This
is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering'. I truly
understood: 'These are defilements' ... 'This is the origin of
defilements' ... 'This is the cessation of defilements' ... 'This is the
practice that leads to the cessation of defilements'. Knowing and seeing
like this, my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire
to be reborn, and ignorance. When it was freed, I knew it was freed.

I understood: 'Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been
completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further
for this place.'

This was the third knowledge, which I achieved in the last watch of the
night. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was
destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent,
keen, and resolute. This was my third breaking out, like a chick
breaking out of the eggshell."

When he said this, the brahmin Verañja said to the Buddha:

"Mister Gotama is the eldest! Mister Gotama is the best! Excellent,
Mister Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or
revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting
a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what's there,
Mister Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge
to Mister Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant
Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Mister Gotama remember me
as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."

### AN 8.12 With Sīha  *Sīhasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the
Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Now at that time several
very prominent Licchavis were sitting together at the town hall,
praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha in many
ways.

Now at that time General Sīha, a disciple of the Jains, was
sitting in that assembly. He thought, "That Blessed One must without a
doubt be a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha. For several very
prominent Licchavis are praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the
Saṅgha in many ways. Why don't I go to see that Blessed
One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!"

Then General Sīha went to the Jain ascetic of the
Ñātika clan and said to him, "Sir, I'd like to go to see
the ascetic Gotama."

"But Sīha, you believe in the doctrine of action. Why
should you go to see the ascetic Gotama, who teaches a doctrine of
inaction? For the ascetic Gotama believes in a doctrine of inaction, he
teaches inaction, and he guides his disciples in that way."

Then Sīha's determination to go and see the Buddha died
down.

For a second time, several prominent Licchavis were sitting together at
the town hall, praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the
Saṅgha in many ways. And for a second time
Sīha thought: "Why don't I go to see that Blessed One, the
perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!"

Then General Sīha went to the Jain Ñātika ...

Then for a second time Sīha's determination to go and see
the Buddha died down.

For a third time, several prominent Licchavis were sitting together at
the town hall, praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the
Saṅgha in many ways. And for a third time Sīha
thought, "That Blessed One must without a doubt be a perfected one, a
fully awakened Buddha. For several very prominent Licchavis are praising
the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways. What
can these Jains do to me, whether I take leave of them or not? Why don't
I, without taking leave of them, go to see that Blessed One, the
perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!"

Then Sīha, with around five hundred chariots, set out from
Vesālī in the middle of the day to see the Buddha. He went
by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and went by
foot. Then General Sīha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat
down to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, I have heard this: 'The ascetic Gotama believes in a doctrine of
inaction, he teaches inaction, and he guides his disciples in that way.'
I trust those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and do not
misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the
teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism?
For we don't want to misrepresent the Blessed One."

"There is, Sīha, a sense in which you could rightly say
that I believe in inaction, I teach inaction, and I guide my disciples
in that way.

And there is a sense in which you could rightly say that I believe in
action, I teach action, and I guide my disciples in that way.

And there is a sense in which you could rightly say that I believe in
annihilationism, I teach annihilation, and I guide my disciples in that
way.

And there is a sense in which you could rightly say that I'm disgusted,
I teach disgust, and I guide my disciples in that way.

And there is a sense in which you could rightly say that I'm an
exterminator, I teach extermination, and I guide my disciples in that
way.

And there is a sense in which you could rightly say that I'm a
mortifier, I teach mortification, and I guide my disciples in that way.

And there is a sense in which you could rightly say that I'm immature, I
teach immaturity, and I guide my disciples in that way.

And there is a sense in which you could rightly say that I'm ambitious,
I teach ambition, and I guide my disciples in that way.

And what's the sense in which you could rightly say that I believe in
inaction, I teach inaction, and I guide my disciples in that way? I
teach inaction regarding bad bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, and the
many kinds of unskillful things. In this sense you could rightly say
that I teach inaction.

And what's the sense in which you could rightly say that I believe in
action, I teach action, and I guide my disciples in that way? I teach
action regarding good bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, and the many
kinds of skillful things. In this sense you could rightly say that I
teach action.

And what's the sense in which you could rightly say that I believe in
annihilationism, I teach annihilation, and I guide my disciples in that
way? I teach the annihilation of greed, hate, and delusion, and the many
kinds of unskillful things. In this sense you could rightly say that I
teach annihilationism.

And what's the sense in which you could rightly say that I'm disgusted,
I teach disgust, and I guide my disciples in that way? I'm disgusted by
bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and by attainment of the
many kinds of unskillful things. In this sense you could rightly say
that I'm disgusted.

And what's the sense in which you could rightly say that I'm an
exterminator, I teach extermination, and I guide my disciples in that
way? I teach the extermination of greed, hate, and delusion, and the
many kinds of unskillful things. In this sense you could rightly say
that I'm an exterminator.

And what's the sense in which you could rightly say that I'm a
mortifier, I teach mortification, and I guide my disciples in that way?
I say that bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind should be
mortified. I say that a mortifier is someone who has given up unskillful
qualities that should be mortified. They've cut them off at the root,
made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they're unable to
arise in the future. The Realized One is someone who has given up
unskillful qualities that should be mortified. He has cut them off at
the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they're
unable to arise in the future. In this sense you could rightly say that
I'm a mortifier.

And what's the sense in which you could rightly say that I'm immature, I
teach immaturity, and I guide my disciples in that way? I say that an
immature person is someone who has given up future wombs and rebirth
into a new state of existence. They've cut them off at the root, made
them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they're unable to
arise in the future. The Realized One has given up future wombs and
rebirth into a new state of existence. He has cut them off at the root,
made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they're unable to
arise in the future. In this sense you could rightly say that I'm
immature.

And what's the sense in which you could rightly say that I'm ambitious,
I teach ambition, and I guide my disciples in that way? I'm ambitious to
offer solace, the highest solace, I teach solace, and I guide my
disciples in that way. In this sense you could rightly say that I'm
ambitious."

When he said this, General Sīha said to the Buddha,
"Excellent, sir! Excellent! From this day forth, may the Buddha remember
me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."

"Sīha, you should act after careful consideration. It's
good for well-known people such as yourself to act after careful
consideration."

"Now I'm even more delighted and satisfied with the Buddha, since he
tells me to act after careful consideration. For if the followers of
other religions were to gain me as a disciple, they'd carry a banner all
over Vesālī, saying: 'General Sīha has become
our disciple!' And yet the Buddha tells me to act after careful
consideration. For a second time, I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the
teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth,
may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for
life."

"For a long time now, Sīha, your family has been a
well-spring of support for the Jain ascetics. You should consider giving
to them when they come."

"Now I'm even more delighted and satisfied with the Buddha, since he
tells me to consider giving to the Jain ascetics when they come. Sir, I
have heard that the ascetic Gotama says this: 'Gifts should only be
given to me, and to my disciples. Only what is given to me is very
fruitful, not what is given to others. Only what is given to my
disciples is very fruitful, not what is given to the disciples of
others.' Yet the Buddha encourages me to give to the Jain ascetics.
Well, sir, we'll know the proper time for that. For a third time, I go
for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant
Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as
a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."

Then the Buddha taught Sīha step by step, with a talk on
giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of
sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of
renunciation. And when the Buddha knew that Sīha's mind was
ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained
the special teaching of the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its
cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would
properly absorb dye, in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision
of the Dhamma arose in General Sīha: "Everything that has a
beginning has an end."

Then Sīha saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the
Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became
self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher's
instructions. He said to the Buddha, "Sir, may the Buddha together with
the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow's meal from
me." The Buddha consented with silence. Then, knowing that the Buddha
had consented, Sīha got up from his seat, bowed, and
respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before
leaving.

Then Sīha addressed a certain man, "Mister, please find out
if there is any meat ready for sale." And when the night had passed
General Sīha had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared
in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,
"Sir, it's time. The meal is ready."

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
went to Sīha's home, where he sat on the seat spread out,
together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Now at that time
many Jain ascetics in Vesālī went from street to street and
from square to square, calling out with raised arms: "Today General
Sīha has slaughtered a fat calf for the ascetic Gotama's
meal. The ascetic Gotama knowingly eats meat prepared specially for him:
this is a deed he caused."

Then a certain person went up to Sīha and whispered in his
ear, "Please sir, you should know this. Many Jain ascetics in
Vesālī are going from street to street and square to
square, calling out with raised arms: 'Today General Sīha
has slaughtered a fat calf for the ascetic Gotama's meal. The ascetic
Gotama knowingly eats meat prepared specially for him: this is a deed he
caused.'"

"Enough, master. For a long time those venerables have wanted to
discredit the Buddha, his teaching, and his Saṅgha. They'll
never stop misrepresenting the Buddha with their incorrect, hollow,
false, untruthful claims. We would never deliberately take the life of a
living creature, not even for life's sake."

Then Sīha served and satisfied the mendicant
Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with
delicious fresh and cooked foods. When the Buddha had eaten and washed
his hand and bowl, Sīha sat down to one side. Then the
Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma
talk, after which he got up from his seat and left.

### AN 8.13 A Thoroughbred  *Assājānīyasutta*

"Mendicants, a fine royal thoroughbred with eight factors is worthy of a
king, fit to serve a king, and considered a factor of kingship. What
eight?

It's when a fine royal thoroughbred is well born on both the mother's
and the father's sides.

He's bred in the region fine thoroughbreds come from.

Whatever food he's given, fresh or dry, he eats carefully, without
making a mess.

He's disgusted by sitting or lying down in excrement or urine.

He's sweet-natured and pleasant to live with, and he doesn't upset the
other horses.

He openly shows his tricks, bluffs, ruses, and feints to his trainer, so
the trainer can try to subdue them.

He carries his load, determining: 'Whether or not the other horses carry
their loads, I'll carry mine.'

He always walks in a straight path. He's strong, and stays strong even
until death.

A fine royal thoroughbred with these eight factors is worthy of a king.
...

In the same way, a mendicant with eight qualities is worthy of offerings
dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious
donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field
of merit for the world. What eight?

It's when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code,
conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places.
Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they've
undertaken.

Whatever food they're given, coarse or fine, they eat carefully, without
bother.

They're disgusted with bad conduct by way of body, speech, or mind, and
by attainment of the many kinds of unskillful things.

They're sweet-natured and pleasant to live with, and they don't upset
the other mendicants.

They openly show their tricks, bluffs, ruses, and feints to their
sensible spiritual companions, so they can try to subdue them.

They do their training, determining: 'Whether or not the other
mendicants do their training, I'll do mine.'

They always walk in a straight path. And here the straight path is right
view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right
effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.

They're energetic: 'Gladly, let my skin, sinews, and bones remain! Let
the blood and flesh waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until
I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.'

A mendicant with these eight qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated
to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation,
worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of
merit for the world."

### AN 8.14 A Wild Colt  *Assakhaḷuṅkasutta*

"Mendicants, I will teach you about eight wild colts and eight defects
in horses, and about eight wild people and eight defects in people.
Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"And what, mendicants, are the eight wild colts and eight defects in
horses?

Firstly, when the trainer says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them on,
some wild colts back right up and spin the chariot behind them. Some
wild colts are like that. This is the first defect of a horse.

Furthermore, when the trainer says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them
on, some wild colts jump back, wreck the hub, and break the triple rod.
Some wild colts are like that. This is the second defect of a horse.

Furthermore, when the trainer says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them
on, some wild colts shake the cart-pole off their thigh and trample it.
Some wild colts are like that. This is the third defect of a horse.

Furthermore, when the trainer says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them
on, some wild colts take a wrong turn, sending the chariot off track.
Some wild colts are like that. This is the fourth defect of a horse.

Furthermore, when the trainer says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them
on, some wild colts rear up and strike out with their fore-legs. Some
wild colts are like that. This is the fifth defect of a horse.

Furthermore, when the trainer says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them
on, some wild colts ignore the trainer and the goad, spit out the bit,
and go wherever they want. Some wild colts are like that. This is the
sixth defect of a horse.

Furthermore, when the trainer says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them
on, some wild colts don't step forward or turn back but stand right
there still as a post. Some wild colts are like that. This is the
seventh defect of a horse.

Furthermore, when the trainer says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them
on, some wild colts tuck in their fore-legs and hind-legs, and sit right
down on their four legs. Some wild colts are like that. This is the
eighth defect of a horse. These are the eight wild colts and the eight
defects in horses.

And what are the eight wild people and eight defects in people?

Firstly, the mendicants accuse a mendicant of an offense. But the
accused mendicant evades it by saying they don't remember. I say that
this person is comparable to the wild colts who, when the trainer says
'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them on, back right up and spin the
chariot behind them. Some wild people are like that. This is the first
defect of a person.

Furthermore, the mendicants accuse a mendicant of an offense. But the
accused mendicant objects to the accuser: 'What has an incompetent fool
like you got to say? How on earth could you imagine you've got something
worth saying!' I say that this person is comparable to the wild colts
who, when the trainer says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them on, jump
back, wreck the hub, and break the triple rod. Some wild people are like
that. This is the second defect of a person.

Furthermore, the mendicants accuse a mendicant of an offense. But the
accused mendicant retorts to the accuser: 'Well, you've fallen into
such-and-such an offense. You should deal with that first.' I say that
this person is comparable to the wild colts who, when the trainer says
'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them on, shake the cart-pole off their
thigh and trample it. Some wild people are like that. This is the third
defect of a person.

Furthermore, the mendicants accuse a mendicant of an offense. But the
accused mendicant dodges the issue, distracts the discussion with
irrelevant points, and displays annoyance, hate, and bitterness. I say
that this person is comparable to the wild colts who, when the trainer
says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them on, take a wrong turn, sending
the chariot off track. Some wild people are like that. This is the
fourth defect of a person.

Furthermore, the mendicants accuse a mendicant of an offense. But the
accused mendicant gesticulates while speaking in the middle of the
Saṅgha. I say that this person is comparable to the wild
colts who, when the trainer says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them on,
rear up and strike out with their fore-legs. Some wild people are like
that. This is the fifth defect of a person.

Furthermore, the mendicants accuse a mendicant of an offense. But the
accused mendicant ignores the Saṅgha and the accusation
and, though still guilty of the offense, they go wherever they want. I
say that this person is comparable to the wild colts who, when the
trainer says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them on, ignore the trainer
and the goad, spit out the bit, and go wherever they want. Some wild
people are like that. This is the sixth defect of a person.

Furthermore, the mendicants accuse a mendicant of an offense. But the
accused mendicant neither confesses to the offense nor denies it, but
frustrates the Saṅgha by staying silent. I say that this
person is comparable to the wild colts who, when the trainer says
'giddyup!' and spurs and goads them on, don't step forward or turn back
but stand right there still as a post. Some wild people are like that.
This is the seventh defect of a person.

Furthermore, the mendicants accuse a mendicant of an offense. But the
accused mendicant says this: 'Why are you venerables making so much of
an issue over me? Now I'll resign the training and return to a lesser
life.' When they have resigned the training, they say: 'Well,
venerables, are you happy now?' I say that this person is comparable to
the wild colts who, when the trainer says 'giddyup!' and spurs and goads
them on, tuck in their fore-legs and hind-legs, and sit right down on
their four legs. Some wild people are like that. This is the eighth
defect of a person.

These are the eight wild people and eight defects in people."

### AN 8.15 Stains  *Malasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these eight stains. What eight? Not reciting is
the stain of hymns. Neglect is the stain of houses. Laziness is the
stain of beauty. Negligence is a guard's stain. Misconduct is a woman's
stain. Stinginess is a giver's stain. Bad, unskillful qualities are a
stain in this world and the next. Worse than any of these is ignorance,
the worst stain of all. These are the eight stains.

> Not reciting is the stain of hymns.\
> The stain of houses is neglect.\

### AN 8.16 Going on a Mission  *Dūteyyasutta*

"Mendicants, a mendicant with eight qualities is worthy of going on a
mission. What eight? It's a mendicant who learns and educates others.
They memorize and remember. They understand and help others understand.
They're skilled at knowing what's on topic and what isn't. And they
don't cause quarrels. A mendicant with these eight qualities is worthy

Having eight qualities Sāriputta is worthy of going on a
mission. What eight? He learns and educates others. He memorizes and
remembers. He understands and helps others understand. He's skilled at
knowing what's on topic and what isn't. And he doesn't cause quarrels.
Having these eight qualities Sāriputta is worthy of going

"Mendicants, a woman catches a man using eight features. What eight?
With weeping, laughing, speaking, appearance, gifts of wildflowers,
scents, tastes, and touches. A woman catches a man using these eight
features. But those beings who are caught by touch are well and truly
caught."

### AN 8.19 With Pahārāda  *Pahārādasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in Verañjā at the root
of a neem tree dedicated to Naḷeru.

Then Pahārāda, lord of titans, went up to the Buddha,
bowed, and stood to one side. The Buddha said to him, "Well,
Pahārāda, do the titans love the ocean?"

"Sir, they do indeed."

"But seeing what incredible and amazing things do the titans love the
ocean?"

"Sir, seeing eight incredible and amazing things the titans love the
ocean. What eight? The ocean gradually slants, slopes, and inclines,
with no abrupt precipice. This is the first thing the titans love about
the ocean.

Furthermore, the ocean is consistent and doesn't overflow its
boundaries. This is the second thing the titans love about the ocean.

Furthermore, the ocean doesn't accommodate a carcass, but quickly
carries it to the shore and strands it on the beach. This is the third
thing the titans love about the ocean.

Furthermore, when they reach the ocean, all the great rivers---that is,
the Ganges, Yamunā, Aciravatī,
Sarabhū, and Mahī---lose their names and clans
and are simply considered 'the ocean'. This is the fourth thing the
titans love about the ocean.

Furthermore, for all the world's streams that reach it, and the showers
that fall from the sky, the ocean never empties or fills up. This is the
fifth thing the titans love about the ocean.

Furthermore, the ocean has just one taste, the taste of salt. This is
the sixth thing the titans love about the ocean.

Furthermore, the ocean is full of many kinds of treasures, such as
pearls, gems, beryl, conch, quartz, coral, silver, native gold, rubies,
and emeralds. This is the seventh thing the titans love about the ocean.

Furthermore, many great beings live in the ocean, such as leviathans,
leviathan-gulpers, leviathan-gulper-gulpers, titans, dragons, and
centaurs. In the ocean there are life-forms a hundred leagues long, or
even two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, or five hundred leagues
long. This is the eighth thing the titans love about the ocean.

Seeing these eight incredible and amazing things the titans love the
ocean.

Well, sir, do the mendicants love this teaching and training?"

"They do indeed, Pahārāda."

"But seeing how many incredible and amazing things do the mendicants
love this teaching and training?"

"Seeing eight incredible and amazing things, Pahārāda, the
mendicants love this teaching and training. What eight?

The ocean gradually slants, slopes, and inclines, with no abrupt
precipice. In the same way in this teaching and training the penetration
to enlightenment comes from gradual training, progress, and practice,
not abruptly. This is the first thing the mendicants love about this
teaching and training.

The ocean is consistent and doesn't overflow its boundaries. In the same
way, when a training rule is laid down for my disciples they wouldn't
break it even for the sake of their own life. This is the second thing
the mendicants love about this teaching and training.

The ocean doesn't accommodate a carcass, but quickly carries it to the
shore and strands it on the beach. In the same way, the
Saṅgha doesn't accommodate a person who is unethical, of
bad qualities, filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true
ascetic or spiritual practitioner---though claiming to be one---rotten
inside, festering, and depraved. But they quickly gather and expel them.
Even if such a person is sitting in the middle of the
Saṅgha, they're far from the Saṅgha, and the
Saṅgha is far from them. This is the third thing the
mendicants love about this teaching and training.

When they reach the ocean, all the great rivers---that is, the Ganges,
Yamunā, Aciravatī, Sarabhū, and
Mahī---lose their names and clans and are simply considered
'the ocean'. In the same way, when they go forth from the lay life to
homelessness, all four classes---aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and
menials---lose their former names and clans and are simply considered
'ascetics who follow the Sakyan'. This is the fourth thing the
mendicants love about this teaching and training.

For all the world's streams that reach it, and the showers that fall
from the sky, the ocean never empties or fills up. In the same way,
though several mendicants become fully extinguished in the element of
extinguishment with no residue, the element of extinguishment never
empties or fills up. This is the fifth thing the mendicants love about
this teaching and training.

The ocean has just one taste, the taste of salt. In the same way, this
teaching and training has one taste, the taste of freedom. This is the
sixth thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training.

The ocean is full of many kinds of treasures, such as pearls, gems,
beryl, conch, quartz, coral, silver, native gold, rubies, and emeralds.
In the same way, this teaching and training is full of many kinds of
treasures, such as the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four
right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the
five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path.
This is the seventh thing the mendicants love about this teaching and
training.

Many great beings live in the ocean, such as leviathans,
leviathan-gulpers, leviathan-gulper-gulpers, titans, dragons, and
centaurs. In the ocean there are life-forms a hundred leagues long, or
even two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, or five hundred leagues
long. In the same way, great beings live in this teaching and training,
and these are those beings. The stream-enterer and the one practicing to
realize the fruit of stream-entry. The once-returner and the one
practicing to realize the fruit of once-return. The non-returner and the
one practicing to realize the fruit of non-return. The perfected one,
and the one practicing for perfection. This is the eighth thing the
mendicants love about this teaching and training.

Seeing these eight incredible and amazing things, Pahārāda,
the mendicants love this teaching and training."

### AN 8.20 Sabbath  *Uposathasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the
stilt longhouse of Migāra's mother in the Eastern
Monastery.

Now, at that time it was the sabbath, and the Buddha was sitting
surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks. And then, as the night
was getting late, in the first watch of the night, Venerable Ānanda got
up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined
palms toward the Buddha and said, "Sir, the night is getting late. It is
the first watch of the night, and the Saṅgha of monks has
been sitting long. Please, sir, may the Buddha recite the monastic code
to the monks."

But when he said this, the Buddha kept silent.

For a second time, as the night was getting late, in the middle watch of
the night, Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one
shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said, "Sir, the
night is getting late. It is the middle watch of the night, and the
Saṅgha of monks has been sitting long. Please, sir, may the
Buddha recite the monastic code to the monks."

But for a second time the Buddha kept silent.

For a third time, as the night was getting late, in the last watch of
the night, as dawn stirred, bringing joy to the night, Ānanda got up
from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined
palms toward the Buddha and said, "Sir, the night is getting late. It is
the last watch of the night and dawn stirs, bringing joy to the night.
And the Saṅgha has been sitting long. Please, sir, may the
Buddha recite the monastic code to the monks."

"Ānanda, the assembly is not pure."

Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna thought, "Who is the Buddha
talking about?"

Then he focused on comprehending the minds of everyone in the
Saṅgha. He saw that unethical person, of bad qualities,
filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true ascetic or
spiritual practitioner---though claiming to be one---rotten inside,
festering, and depraved, sitting in the middle of the
Saṅgha.

When he saw him he got up from his seat, went up to him and said, "Get
up, reverend. The Buddha has seen you. You can't live in communion with
the monks."

But when he said this, that person kept silent.

For a second time

and a third time, he asked that monk to leave.

But for a third time that person kept silent.

Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna took that person by the arm,
ejected him out the gate, and bolted the door. Then he went up to the
Buddha, and said to him, "I have ejected that person. The assembly is
pure. Please, sir, may the Buddha recite the monastic code to the
monks."

"It's incredible, Moggallāna, it's amazing, how that futile
man waited to be taken by the arm!"

Then the Buddha said to the monks:

"Now, monks, you should perform the sabbath and recite the monastic
code. From this day forth, I will not perform the sabbath or recite the
monastic code. It's impossible, monks, it can't happen that a Realized
One could recite the monastic code in an impure assembly.

Seeing these eight incredible and amazing things the titans love the
ocean. What eight? The ocean gradually slants, slopes, and inclines,
with no abrupt precipice. This is the first thing the titans love about
the ocean.
