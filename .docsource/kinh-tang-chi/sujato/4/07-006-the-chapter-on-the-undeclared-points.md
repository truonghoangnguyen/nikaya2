# The Chapter on the Undeclared Points

### AN 7.54 The Undeclared Points  *Abyākatasutta*

Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and
said to him:

"Sir, what is the cause, what is the reason why a learned noble disciple
has no doubts regarding the undeclared points?"

"Mendicant, it's due to the cessation of views that a learned noble
disciple has no doubts regarding the undeclared points. 'A realized one
still exists after death': this is a misconception. 'A realized one no
longer exists after death': this is a misconception. 'A realized one
both still exists and no longer exists after death': this is a
misconception. 'A realized one neither still exists nor no longer exists
after death': this is a misconception. An unlearned ordinary person
doesn't understand views, their origin, their cessation, or the practice
that leads to their cessation. And so their views grow. They're not
freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain,
sadness, and distress. They're not freed from suffering, I say.

A learned noble disciple does understand views, their origin, their
cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation. And so their
views cease. They're freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from
sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They're freed from
suffering, I say. Knowing and seeing this, a learned noble disciple does
not answer: 'A realized one still exists after death', 'A realized one
no longer exists after death', 'a realized one both still exists and no
longer exists after death', 'a realized one neither still exists nor no
longer exists after death.' Knowing and seeing this, a learned noble
disciple does not declare the undeclared points. Knowing and seeing
this, a learned noble disciple doesn't shake, tremble, quake, or get
nervous regarding the undeclared points.

'A realized one still exists after death': this is just about craving.
... it's just about perception ... it's a conceiving ... it's a
proliferation ... it's just about grasping ... 'A realized one still
exists after death': this is a regret. 'A realized one no longer exists
after death': this is a regret. 'A realized one both still exists and no
longer exists after death': this is a regret. 'A realized one neither
still exists nor no longer exists after death': this is a regret. An
unlearned ordinary person doesn't understand regrets, their origin,
their cessation, or the practice that leads to their cessation. And so
their regrets grow. They're not freed from rebirth, old age, and death,
from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They're not freed
from suffering, I say.

A learned noble disciple does understand regrets, their origin, their
cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation. And so their
regrets cease. They're freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from
sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They're freed from

regarding the undeclared points."

### AN 7.55 Places People Are Reborn  *Purisagatisutta*

"Mendicants, I will teach you seven places people are reborn, and
extinguishment by not grasping. Listen and apply your mind well, I will
speak."

"Yes, sir," the mendicants replied. The Buddha said this:

"And what are the seven places people are reborn?

Take a mendicant who practices like this: 'It might not be, and it might
not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine. I am giving up
what exists, what has come to be.' They gain equanimity. They're not
attached to life, or to creating a new life. And they see with right
wisdom that there is a peaceful state beyond. But they haven't
completely realized that state. They haven't totally given up the
underlying tendencies of conceit, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.
With the ending of the five lower fetters they're extinguished between
one life and the next. Suppose you struck an iron pot that had been
heated all day. Any spark that flew off would be extinguished. In the
same way, a mendicant who practices like this ... With the ending of the
five lower fetters they're extinguished between one life and the next.

not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine. I am giving up
what exists, what has come to be.' They gain equanimity. They're not
attached to life, or to creating a new life. And they see with right
wisdom that there is a peaceful state beyond. But they haven't totally
realized that state. They haven't completely given up the underlying
tendencies of conceit, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. With the
ending of the five lower fetters they're extinguished between one life
and the next. Suppose you struck an iron pot that had been heated all
day. Any spark that flew off and floated away would be extinguished. In
the same way, a mendicant who practices like this ... With the ending of
the five lower fetters they're extinguished between one life and the
next.

Take a mendicant who practices like this: 'It might not be, and it might
not be mine. ...' With the ending of the five lower fetters they're
extinguished between one life and the next. Suppose you struck an iron
pot that had been heated all day. Any spark that flew off and floated
away would be extinguished just before landing. In the same way, a
mendicant who practices like this ... With the ending of the five lower
fetters they're extinguished between one life and the next.

Take a mendicant who practices like this: 'It might not be, and it might
not be mine. ...' With the ending of the five lower fetters they're
extinguished upon landing. Suppose you struck an iron pot that had been
heated all day. Any spark that flew off and floated away would be
extinguished on landing. In the same way, a mendicant who practices like
this ... 'It might not be, and it might not be mine. ...' With the
ending of the five lower fetters they're extinguished upon landing.

Take a mendicant who practices like this: 'It might not be, and it might
not be mine. ...' With the ending of the five lower fetters they're
extinguished without extra effort. Suppose you struck an iron pot that
had been heated all day. Any spark that flew off and floated away would
fall on a little heap of grass or twigs. There it would ignite a fire
and produce smoke. But the fire would consume the grass or twigs and
become extinguished due to not being fed. In the same way, a mendicant
who practices like this ... 'It might not be, and it might not be mine.
...' With the ending of the five lower fetters they're extinguished
without extra effort.

Take a mendicant who practices like this: 'It might not be, and it might
not be mine. ...' With the ending of the five lower fetters they're
extinguished with extra effort. Suppose you struck an iron pot that had
been heated all day. Any spark that flew off and floated away would fall
on a large heap of grass or twigs. There it would ignite a fire and
produce smoke. But the fire would consume the grass or twigs and become
extinguished due to not being fed. In the same way, a mendicant who
practices like this ... 'It might not be, and it might not be mine. ...'
With the ending of the five lower fetters they're extinguished with

what exists, what has come to be.' They gain equanimity. They're not
attached to life, or to creating a new life. And they see with right
wisdom that there is a peaceful state beyond. But they haven't totally
realized that state. They haven't completely given up the underlying
tendencies of conceit, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. With the
ending of the five lower fetters they head upstream, going to the
Akaniṭṭha realm. Suppose you struck an iron pot that had
been heated all day. Any spark that flew off and floated away would fall
on a huge heap of grass or twigs. There it would ignite a fire and
produce smoke. And after consuming the grass and twigs, the fire would
burn up plants and trees until it reached a green field, a roadside, a
cliff's edge, a body of water, or cleared parkland, where it would be
extinguished due to not being fed. In the same way, a mendicant who
practices like this ... 'It might not be, and it might not be mine. ...'
With the ending of the five lower fetters they head upstream, going to
the Akaniṭṭha realm. These are the seven places people are
reborn.

And what is extinguishment by not grasping? Take a mendicant who
practices like this: 'It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will
not be, and it will not be mine. I am giving up what exists, what has
come to be.' They gain equanimity. They're not attached to life, or to
creating a new life. And they see with right wisdom that there is a
peaceful state beyond. And they have totally realized that state.
They've completely given up the underlying tendencies of conceit, desire
to be reborn, and ignorance. They've realized the undefiled freedom of
heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized
it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. This is
called extinguishment by not grasping.

These are the seven places people are reborn, and extinguishment by not
grasping."

### AN 7.56 Tissa the Divinity  *Tissabrahmāsutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, on the Vulture's Peak Mountain.

Then, late at night, two glorious deities, lighting up the entire
Vulture's Peak, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. One
deity said to him, "Sir, these nuns are freed!"

The other deity said to him, "Sir, these nuns are well freed with no
residue!"

This is what those deities said, and the teacher approved. Then those
deities, knowing that the teacher approved, bowed and respectfully
circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right
there.

Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that
had happened.

Now at that time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was sitting not
far from the Buddha. He thought, "Which gods know whether a person has
anything left over or not?"

Now, at that time a monk called Tissa had recently passed away and been
reborn in a realm of divinity. There they knew that Tissa the Divinity
was very mighty and powerful.

And then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, as easily as a strong
person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Vulture's
Peak and reappeared in that realm of divinity.

Tissa saw Moggallāna coming off in the distance, and said
to him, "Come, my good Moggallāna! Welcome, my good
Moggallāna! It's been a long time since you took the
opportunity to come here. Sit, my good Moggallāna, this
seat is for you."

Moggallāna sat down on the seat spread out. Then Tissa
bowed to Moggallāna and sat to one side.

Moggallāna said to him, "Which gods know whether a person
has anything left over or not?"

"The gods of the Divinity's host know this."

"But do all of them know this?"

"No, my good Moggallāna, not all of them.

Those gods of the Divinity's host who are content with the lifespan of
the Divinity, with the beauty, happiness, glory, and sovereignty of the
Divinity, and who don't truly understand any escape beyond: they don't
know this. But those gods of the Divinity's host who are not content
with the lifespan of the Divinity, with the beauty, happiness, glory,
and sovereignty of the Divinity, and who do truly understand any escape
beyond: they do know this.

Take a mendicant who is freed both ways. The gods know of them: 'This
venerable is freed both ways. As long as their body remains they will be
seen by gods and humans. But when their body breaks up gods and humans
will see them no more.' This too is how those gods know whether a person
has anything left over or not.

Take a mendicant who is freed by wisdom. The gods know of them: 'This
venerable is freed by wisdom. As long as their body remains they will be
seen by gods and humans. But when their body breaks up gods and humans
will see them no more.' This too is how those gods know whether a person
has anything left over or not.

Take a mendicant who is a direct witness. The gods know of them: 'This
venerable is a direct witness. Hopefully this venerable will frequent
appropriate lodgings, associate with good friends, and control their
faculties. Then they might realize the supreme culmination of the
spiritual path in this very life, and live having achieved with their
own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay
life to homelessness.' This too is how those gods know whether a person
has anything left over or not.

Take a mendicant who is attained to view. ... freed by faith ... a
follower of teachings. The gods know of them: 'This venerable is a
follower of teachings. Hopefully this venerable will frequent
appropriate lodgings, associate with good friends, and control their
faculties. Then they might realize the supreme culmination of the
spiritual path in this very life, and live having achieved with their
own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay
life to homelessness.' This too is how those gods know whether a person
has anything left over or not."

Moggallāna approved and agreed with what Tissa the Divinity
said. Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their
arm, he vanished from the realm of divinity and reappeared on the
Vulture's Peak. Then Mahāmoggallāna went up to the Buddha,
bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.

"But Moggallāna, Tissa the Divinity didn't teach the
seventh person, the signless meditator."

"Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! May the Buddha
teach the seventh person, the signless meditator. The mendicants will
listen and remember it."

"Well then, Moggallāna, listen and apply your mind well, I
will speak."

"Yes, sir," Mahāmoggallāna replied. The Buddha said this:

"Moggallāna, take the case of a mendicant who, not focusing
on any signs, enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart.
The gods know of them: 'This venerable, not focusing on any signs,
enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart. Hopefully
this venerable will frequent appropriate lodgings, associate with good
friends, and control their faculties. Then they might realize the
supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life, and live
having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen
rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.' This too is how
those gods know whether a person has anything left over or not."

### AN 7.57 General Sīha  *Sīhasenāpatisutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked
roof. Then General Sīha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat
down to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, can you point out a fruit of giving that's apparent in the present
life?"

"Well then, Sīha, I'll ask you about this in return, and
you can answer as you like. What do you think, Sīha?
Consider two people. One is faithless, stingy, miserly, and abusive. One
is a faithful donor who loves charity. Which do you think the perfected
ones will show sympathy for first?"

"Why would the perfected ones first show sympathy for the person who is
faithless, stingy, miserly, and abusive? They'd show sympathy first for
the faithful donor who loves charity."

"Which do you think the perfected ones will first approach?" "They'd
first approach the faithful donor who loves charity."

"Which do you think the perfected ones will receive alms from first?"
"They'd receive alms first from the faithful donor who loves charity."

"Which do you think the perfected ones will teach the Dhamma to first?"
"They'd first teach the Dhamma to the faithful donor who loves charity."

"Which do you think would get a good reputation?" "The faithful donor
who loves charity would get a good reputation."

"Which do you think would enter any kind of assembly bold and assured,
whether it's an assembly of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or
ascetics?"

"How could the person who is faithless, stingy, miserly, and abusive
enter any kind of assembly bold and assured, whether it's an assembly of
aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics? The faithful donor who
loves charity would enter any kind of assembly bold and assured, whether
it's an assembly of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics."

"When their body breaks up, after death, which do you think would be
reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm?"

"Why would the person who is faithless, stingy, miserly, and abusive be
reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm? The faithful donor who loves
charity would, when their body breaks up, after death, be reborn in a
good place, a heavenly realm.

When it comes to these fruits of giving that are apparent in the present
life, I don't have to rely on faith in the Buddha, for I know them too.
I'm a giver, a donor, and the perfected ones show sympathy for me first.
I'm a giver, and the perfected ones approach me first. I'm a giver, and
the perfected ones receive alms from me first. I'm a giver, and the
perfected ones teach me Dhamma first. I'm a giver, and I have this good
reputation: 'General Sīha gives, serves, and attends on the
Saṅgha.' I'm a giver, I enter any kind of assembly bold and
assured, whether it's an assembly of aristocrats, brahmins,
householders, or ascetics. When it comes to these fruits of giving that
are apparent in the present life, I don't have to rely on faith in the
Buddha, for I know them too. But when the Buddha says: 'When a giver's
body breaks up, after death, they're reborn in a good place, a heavenly
realm.' I don't know this, so I have to rely on faith in the Buddha."

"That's so true, Sīha! That's so true! When a giver's body
breaks up, after death, they're reborn in a good place, a heavenly
realm."

### AN 7.58 Nothing to Hide  *Arakkheyyasutta*

"Mendicants, there are four areas where the Realized One has nothing to
hide, and three ways he is irreproachable. What are the four areas where
the Realized One has nothing to hide?

His bodily behavior is pure. So the Realized One has no bodily
misconduct to hide, thinking: 'Don't let others find this out about me!'

His verbal behavior is pure. So the Realized One has no verbal
misconduct to hide, thinking: 'Don't let others find this out about me!'

His mental behavior is pure. So the Realized One has no mental
misconduct to hide, thinking: 'Don't let others find this out about me!'

His livelihood is pure. So the Realized One has no wrong livelihood to
hide, thinking: 'Don't let others find this out about me!'

These are the four areas where the Realized One has nothing to hide.

What are the three ways the Realized One is irreproachable?

The Realized One has explained the teaching well. I see no reason for
anyone---whether ascetic, brahmin, god, Māra, or the
Divinity, or anyone else in the world---to legitimately scold me,
saying: 'For such and such reasons you haven't explained the teaching
well.' Since I see no such reason, I live secure, fearless, and assured.

I have clearly described the practice that leads to extinguishment for
my disciples. Practicing in accordance with this, my disciples realize
the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life.
And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the
ending of defilements. I see no reason for anyone---whether ascetic,
brahmin, god, Māra, or the Divinity, or anyone else in the
world---to legitimately scold me, saying: 'For such and such reasons you
haven't clearly described the practice that leads to extinguishment for
your disciples.' Since I see no such reason, I live secure, fearless,
and assured.

Many hundreds in my assembly of disciples have realized the undefiled
freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live
having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of
defilements. I see no reason for anyone---whether ascetic, brahmin, god,
Māra, or the Divinity, or anyone else in the world---to
legitimately scold me, saying: 'For such and such reasons you don't have
many hundreds of disciples in your following who have realized the
undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and
who live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of
defilements.' Since I see no such reason, I live secure, fearless, and
assured.

These are the three ways the Realized One is irreproachable.

These are the four areas where the Realized One has nothing to hide, and
the three ways he is irreproachable."

### AN 7.59 With Kimbila  *Kimilasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Kimbilā in the Freshwater Mangrove Wood. Then Venerable
Kimbila went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to
him:

"What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why the true teaching does
not last long after the final quenching of the Realized One?"

"Kimbila, it's when the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen lack respect
and reverence for the Teacher, the teaching, the Saṅgha,
the training, immersion, diligence, and hospitality after the final
quenching of the Realized One. This is the cause, this is the reason why
the true teaching does not last long after the final quenching of the
Realized One."

"What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why the true teaching does
last long after the final quenching of the Realized One?"

"Kimbila, it's when the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen maintain
respect and reverence for the Teacher, the teaching, the
Saṅgha, the training, immersion, diligence, and hospitality
after the final quenching of the Realized One. This is the cause, this
is the reason why the true teaching does last long after the final
quenching of the Realized One."

### AN 7.60 Seven Qualities  *Sattadhammasutta*

"Mendicants, a mendicant with seven qualities soon realizes the supreme
culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. They live having
achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go
forth from the lay life to homelessness. What seven? It's when a
mendicant is faithful, ethical, learned, secluded, energetic, mindful,
and wise. A mendicant with these seven qualities soon realizes the
supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. They live
having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen
rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.61 Nodding Off  *Pacalāyamānasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying in the
land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at
Bhesakaḷā's Wood.

Now at that time, in the land of the Magadhans near
Kallavāḷamutta Village, Venerable
Mahāmoggallāna was nodding off while meditating. The Buddha
saw him with his clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman. Then, as
easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he
vanished from the deer park at Bhesakaḷā's Wood in the land
of the Bhaggas and reappeared in front of Mahāmoggallāna
near Kallavāḷamutta Village in the land of the Magadhans.

He sat on the seat spread out and said to Mahāmoggallāna,
"Are you nodding off, Moggallāna? Are you nodding off?"

"Yes, sir."

"So, Moggallāna, don't focus on or cultivate the perception
that you were meditating on when you fell drowsy. It's possible that
you'll give up drowsiness in this way.

But what if that doesn't work? Then think about and consider the
teaching as you've learned and memorized it, examining it with your
mind. It's possible that you'll give up drowsiness in this way.

But what if that doesn't work? Then recite in detail the teaching as
you've learned and memorized it. It's possible that you'll give up
drowsiness in this way.

But what if that doesn't work? Then pinch your ears and rub your limbs.
It's possible that you'll give up drowsiness in this way.

But what if that doesn't work? Then get up from your seat, flush your
eyes with water, look around in every direction, and look up at the
stars and constellations. It's possible that you'll give up drowsiness
in this way.

But what if that doesn't work? Then apply your mind to the perception of
light, focusing on the perception of day: as by day, so by night; as by
night, so by day. And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, develop a
mind that's full of radiance. It's possible that you'll give up
drowsiness in this way.

But what if that doesn't work? Then walk mindfully, focusing on the
perception of before and behind, your faculties directed inwards and
your mind not scattered outside. It's possible that you'll give up
drowsiness in this way.

But what if that doesn't work? Then lie down in the lion's posture---on
the right side, placing one foot on top of the other---mindful and
aware, and focused on the time of getting up. When you wake, you should
get up quickly, thinking: 'I will not live indulging in the pleasures of
sleeping, lying down, and drowsing.' That's how you should train.

So you should train like this: 'I will not approach families with my
head swollen with vanity.' That's how you should train. What happens if
a mendicant approaches families with a head swollen with vanity? Well,
families have business to attend to, so people might not notice when a
mendicant arrives. In that case the mendicant thinks: 'Who on earth has
turned this family against me? It seems they don't like me any more.'
And so, because they don't get anything they feel dismayed. Being
dismayed, they become restless. Being restless, they lose restraint. And
without restraint the mind is far from immersion.

So you should train like this: 'I won't get into arguments.' That's how
you should train. When there's an argument, you can expect there'll be
lots of talking. When there's lots of talking, people become restless.
Being restless, they lose restraint. And without restraint the mind is
far from immersion. Moggallāna, I don't praise all kinds of
closeness. Nor do I criticize all kinds of closeness. I don't praise
closeness with laypeople and renunciates. I do praise closeness with
those lodgings that are quiet and still, far from the madding crowd,
remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat."

When he said this, Venerable Moggallāna asked the Buddha,
"Sir, how do you briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the
ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate
sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal,
and is best among gods and humans?"

"Take a mendicant who has heard: 'Nothing is worth insisting on.' When a
mendicant has heard that nothing is worth insisting on, they directly
know all things. Directly knowing all things, they completely understand
all things. Completely understanding all things, when they experience
any kind of feeling---pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral---they meditate
observing impermanence, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in those
feelings. Meditating in this way, they don't grasp at anything in the
world. Not grasping, they're not anxious. Not being anxious, they
personally become extinguished.

They understand: 'Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been
completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further
for this place.' That's how I briefly define a mendicant who is freed
through the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the
ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the
ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans."

### AN 7.62 Don't Fear Good Deeds  *Mettasutta*

"Mendicants, don't fear good deeds. For 'good deeds' is a term for
happiness. I recall undergoing for a long time the likable, desirable,
and agreeable results of good deeds performed over a long time. I
developed a mind of love for seven years. As a result, for seven eons of
the cosmos contracting and expanding I didn't return to this world
again. As the cosmos contracted I went to the realm of streaming
radiance. As it expanded I was reborn in an empty mansion of divinity.

There I was the Divinity, the Great Divinity, the vanquisher, the
unvanquished, the universal seer, the wielder of power. I was Sakka,
lord of gods, thirty-six times. Many hundreds of times I was a king, a
wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. My dominion extended
to all four sides, I achieved stability in the country, and I possessed
the seven treasures. These were my seven treasures: the wheel, the
elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder, and the
commander as the seventh treasure. I had over a thousand sons who were
valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of my enemies. After conquering
this land girt by sea, I reigned by principle, without rod or sword.

> See the result of good deeds,\
> of skillful deeds, for one seeking happiness.\
> I developed a mind of love\
> for seven years, mendicants.\
> For seven eons of expansion and contraction\
> I didn't return to this world again.
>
> As the world contracted\
> I went to the realm of streaming radiance.\
> And when it expanded\
> I went to an empty mansion of divinity.
>
> Seven times I was a Great Divinity,\
> and at that time I was the wielder of power.\
> Thirty-six times I was lord of gods,\

>
> Then I was king, a wheel-turning monarch,\
> lord of the Black Plum Tree Land.\
> An anointed aristocrat,\
> I was sovereign of all humans.
>
> Without rod or sword,\
> I conquered this land.\
> Through non-violent action\
> I guided it justly.
>
> After ruling this vast territory\
> by means of principle,\
> I was born in a rich family,\
> affluent and wealthy.
>
> It was replete with all sense pleasures,\

> This was well taught by the Buddhas,\

> This is the cause of greatness\

### AN 7.63 Kinds of Wives  *Bhariyāsutta*

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
went to the home of the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, where he
sat on the seat spread out.

Now at that time people in Anāthapiṇḍika's home were making
a dreadful racket. Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went
up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to
him, "Householder, what's with the people making that dreadful racket in
your home? You'd think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!"

"Sir, that's my daughter-in-law Sujātā. She's been brought
here from a wealthy family. She doesn't obey her mother-in-law or
father-in-law or her husband. And she does not honor, respect, esteem,
and venerate the Buddha."

Then the Buddha addressed Sujātā, saying, "Come,
Sujātā."

"Yes, sir," she replied. She went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down
to one side. The Buddha said to her:

"Sujātā, a man can have seven kinds of wife. What seven? A
wife like a killer, a wife like a thief, a wife like a lord, a wife like
a mother, a wife like a sister, a wife like a friend, and a wife like a
bondservant. These are the kinds of wife that a man can have. Which one
of these are you?"

"Sir, I don't understand the detailed meaning of what the Buddha has
said in brief. Please teach me this matter so I can understand the
detailed meaning."

"Well then, Sujātā, listen and apply your mind well, I will
speak."

"Yes, sir," she replied. The Buddha said this:

> "With a mind full of hate and no kindness,\
> lusting for others, looking down on her husband,\
> she longs to murder him who paid the price for her.\
> A man's wife of this sort\
> is called a wife and a killer.
>
> A woman's husband earns his wealth\
> by focusing on a profession, trade, or farming.\
> And even if it's only a little, she wants to take it.\
> A man's wife of this sort\
> is called a wife and a thief.
>
> She's an idle glutton who doesn't want to work.\
> Her words are harsh, fierce, and rude.\
> She rules over him, though he rises early.\
> A man's wife of this sort\
> is called a wife and a lord.
>
> She's always caring and kind,\
> looking after her husband like a mother her child.\
> She keeps the wealth that he has earned secure.\
> A man's wife of this sort\
> is called a wife and a mother.
>
> She respects her husband\
> as a younger sister respects her elder.\
> Conscientious, she does what her husband says.\
> A man's wife of this sort\
> is called a wife and a sister.
>
> She's delighted to see him,\
> like one reunited with a long-lost friend.\
> She's of good pedigree, virtuous, and devoted.\
> A man's wife of this sort\
> is called a wife and a friend.
>
> She has no anger\
> \>when threatened with violence by the rod.\
> Without hate or anger,\
> she endures her husband and does what he says.\
> A man's wife of this sort\
> is called a wife and a bondservant.
>
> The kinds of wives here called\
> killer, thief, and lord;\
> immoral, harsh, and lacking regard for others,\
> when their body breaks up they set course for hell.
>
> But the kinds of wives here called\
> mother, sister, friend, and bondservant;\
> steadfast in their own morality,\
> \>restrained for a long time,\
> when their body breaks up\
> \>they set course for a good place.

Sujātā, these are the seven kinds of wife that a man can
have. Which one of these are you?"

"Sir, from this day forth may the Buddha remember me as a wife like a
bondservant."

### AN 7.64 Irritable  *Kodhanasutta*

"Mendicants, these seven things that please and assist an enemy happen
to an irritable woman or man. What seven?

Firstly, an enemy wishes for an enemy: 'If only they'd become ugly!' Why
is that? Because an enemy doesn't like to have a beautiful enemy. An
irritable individual, overcome and overwhelmed by anger, is ugly, even
though they're nicely bathed and anointed, with hair and beard dressed,
and wearing white clothes. This is the first thing that pleases and
assists an enemy which happens to an irritable woman or man.

Furthermore, an enemy wishes for an enemy: 'If only they'd sleep badly!'
Why is that? Because an enemy doesn't like to have an enemy who sleeps
at ease. An irritable individual, overcome and overwhelmed by anger,
sleeps badly, even though they sleep on a couch spread with woolen
covers---shag-piled, pure white, or embroidered with flowers---and
spread with a fine deer hide, with a canopy above and red pillows at
both ends. This is the second thing ...

Furthermore, an enemy wishes for an enemy: 'If only they don't get all
they need!' Why is that? Because an enemy doesn't like to have an enemy
who gets all they need. When an irritable individual, overcome and
overwhelmed by anger, gets what they don't need they think, 'I've got
what I need.' When they get what they need they think, 'I've got what I
don't need.' When an angry person gets these things that are the exact
opposite of what they need, it's for their lasting harm and suffering.
This is the third thing ...

Furthermore, an enemy wishes for an enemy: 'If only they weren't
wealthy!' Why is that? Because an enemy doesn't like to have an enemy
who is wealthy. When an individual is irritable, overcome and
overwhelmed by anger, the rulers seize the legitimate wealth they've
earned by their efforts, built up with their own hands, gathered by the
sweat of their brow. This is the fourth thing ...

Furthermore, an enemy wishes for an enemy: 'If only they weren't
famous!' Why is that? Because an enemy doesn't like to have a famous
enemy. When an individual is irritable, overcome and overwhelmed by
anger, any fame they have acquired by diligence falls to dust. This is
the fifth thing ...

Furthermore, an enemy wishes for an enemy: 'If only they had no
friends!' Why is that? Because an enemy doesn't like to have an enemy
with friends. When an individual is irritable, overcome and overwhelmed
by anger, their friends and colleagues, relatives and kin avoid them
from afar. This is the sixth thing ...

Furthermore, an enemy wishes for an enemy: 'If only, when their body
breaks up, after death, they're reborn in a place of loss, a bad place,
the underworld, hell!' Why is that? Because an enemy doesn't like to
have an enemy who goes to a good place. When an individual is irritable,
overcome and overwhelmed by anger, they do bad things by way of body,
speech, and mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they're reborn
in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. This is the
seventh thing that pleases and assists an enemy which happens to an
irritable woman or man.

These are the seven things that please and assist an enemy which happen
to an irritable woman or man.

> An irritable person is ugly\
> and they sleep badly.\
> When they get what they need,\
> they take it to be what they don't need.
>
> An angry person\
> kills with body or speech;\
> overcome with anger,\
> they lose their wealth.
>
> Mad with anger,\
> they fall into disgrace.\
> Family, friends, and loved ones\
> avoid an irritable person.
>
> Anger creates harm;\
> anger upsets the mind.\
> That person doesn't recognize\
> the danger that arises within.
>
> An angry person doesn't know the good.\
> An angry person doesn't see the truth.\
> When a person is beset by anger,\
> only blind darkness is left.
>
> An angry person destroys with ease\
> what was hard to build.\
> Afterwards, when the anger is spent,\
> they're tormented as if burnt by fire.
>
> Their look betrays their sulkiness\
> like a fire's smoky plume.\
> And when their anger flares up,\
> they make others angry.
>
> They have no conscience or prudence,\
> nor any respectful speech.\
> One overcome by anger\
> has no island refuge anywhere.
>
> The deeds that torment a man\
> are far from those that are good.\
> I'll explain them now;\
> listen to this, for it is the truth.
>
> An angry person slays their father;\
> their mother, too, they slay.\
> An angry person slays a saint;\
> a normal person, too, they slay.
>
> A man is raised by his mother,\
> who shows him the world.\
> But an angry ordinary person slays\
> even that good woman who gave him life.
>
> Like oneself, all sentient beings\
> hold themselves most dear.\
> But angry people kill themselves all kinds of ways,\
> distraught for many reasons.
>
> Some kill themselves with swords,\
> some, distraught, take poison.\
> Some hang themselves with rope,\
> or fling themselves down a mountain gorge.
>
> When they commit deeds of killing babes\
> and killing themselves,\
> they don't realize what they do,\
> for anger leads to their downfall.
>
> The snare of death in the form of anger\
> lies hidden in the heart.\
> You should cut it out by self-control,\
> by wisdom, energy, and right ideas.
>
> An astute person should cut out\
> this unskillful thing.\
> And they'd train in the teaching in just the same way,\
> not yielding to sulkiness.
>
> Free of anger, free of despair,\
> free of greed, with no more longing,\
> tamed, having given up anger,\
> the undefiled are fully extinguished.
