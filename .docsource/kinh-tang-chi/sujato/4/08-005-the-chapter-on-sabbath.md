# The Chapter on Sabbath

### AN 8.41 The Sabbath With Eight Factors, In Brief  *Saṁkhittūposathasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, the observance of the sabbath with its eight factors is
very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful. And how should
it be observed? It's when a noble disciple reflects: 'As long as they
live, the perfected ones give up killing living creatures, renouncing
the rod and the sword. They are scrupulous and kind, and live full of
sympathy for all living beings. I, too, for this day and night will give
up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. I'll be
scrupulous and kind, and live full of sympathy for all living beings. I
will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this
respect.' This is its first factor.

'As long as they live, the perfected ones give up stealing. They take
only what's given, and expect only what's given. They keep themselves
clean by not thieving. I, too, for this day and night will give up
stealing. I'll take only what's given, and expect only what's given.
I'll keep myself clean by not thieving. I will observe the sabbath by
doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.' This is its second
factor.

'As long as they live, the perfected ones give up unchastity. They are
celibate, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex. I, too, for this
day and night will give up unchastity. I will be celibate, set apart,
avoiding the vulgar act of sex. I will observe the sabbath by doing as
the perfected ones do in this respect.' This is its third factor.

'As long as they live, the perfected ones give up lying. They speak the
truth and stick to the truth. They're honest and trustworthy, and don't
trick the world with their words. I, too, for this day and night will
give up lying. I'll speak the truth and stick to the truth. I'll be
honest and dependable, and won't trick the world with my words. I will
observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.'
This is its fourth factor.

'As long as they live, the perfected ones give up beer, wine, and liquor
intoxicants. I, too, for this day and night will give up beer, wine, and
liquor intoxicants. I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected
ones do in this respect.' This is its fifth factor.

'As long as they live, the perfected ones eat in one part of the day,
abstaining from eating at night and from food at the wrong time. I, too,
for this day and night will eat in one part of the day, abstaining from
eating at night and food at the wrong time. I will observe the sabbath
by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.' This is its sixth
factor.

'As long as they live, the perfected ones give up seeing shows of
dancing, singing, and music ; and beautifying and adorning themselves
with garlands, fragrance, and makeup. I, too, for this day and night
will give up seeing shows of dancing, singing, and music ; and
beautifying and adorning myself with garlands, fragrance, and makeup. I
will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this
respect.' This is its seventh factor.

'As long as they live, the perfected ones give up high and luxurious
beds. They sleep in a low place, either a small bed or a straw mat. I,
too, for this day and night will give up high and luxurious beds. I'll
sleep in a low place, either a small bed or a straw mat. I will observe
the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.' This is
its eighth factor.

The observance of the sabbath with its eight factors in this way is very
fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful."

### AN 8.42 The Sabbath With Eight Factors, In Detail  *Vitthatūposathasutta*

"Mendicants, the observance of the sabbath with its eight factors is
very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful. And how should
it be observed?

It's when a noble disciple reflects: 'As long as they live, the
perfected ones give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and
the sword. They are scrupulous and kind, and live full of sympathy for
all living beings. I, too, for this day and night will give up killing
living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. I'll be scrupulous
and kind, and live full of sympathy for all living beings. I will
observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.'
This is its first factor. ...

'As long as they live, the perfected ones give up high and luxurious
beds. They sleep in a low place, either a small bed or a straw mat. I,
too, for this day and night will give up high and luxurious beds. I'll
sleep in a low place, either a small bed or a straw mat. I will observe
the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.' This is
its eighth factor. The observance of the sabbath with its eight factors
in this way is very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful.

How much so? Suppose you were to rule as sovereign lord over these
sixteen great countries---Aṅga, Magadha, Kāsi,
Kosala, Vajji, Malla, Cetī, Vaccha, Kuru,
Pañcāla, Maccha, Sūrasena, Assaka, Avanti,
Gandhāra, and Kamboja---full of the seven kinds of precious
things. This wouldn't be worth a sixteenth part of the sabbath with its
eight factors. Why is that? Because human kingship is a poor thing
compared to the happiness of the gods.

Fifty years in the human realm is one day and night for the gods of the
four great kings. Thirty such days make up a month. Twelve such months
make up a year. The lifespan of the gods of the four great kings is five
hundred of these heavenly years. It's possible that some woman or man
who has observed the eight-factored sabbath will---when their body
breaks up, after death---be reborn in the company of the gods of the
four great kings. This is what I was referring to when I said: 'Human
kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.'

A hundred years in the human realm is one day and night for the gods of
the thirty-three. Thirty such days make up a month. Twelve such months
make up a year. The lifespan of the gods of the thirty-three is a
thousand of these heavenly years. It's possible that some woman or man
who has observed the eight-factored sabbath will---when their body
breaks up, after death---be reborn in the company of the gods of the
thirty-three. This is what I was referring to when I said: 'Human
kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.'

Two hundred years in the human realm is one day and night for the gods
of Yama. Thirty such days make up a month. Twelve such months make up a
year. The lifespan of the gods of Yama is two thousand of these heavenly
years. It's possible that some woman or man who has observed the
eight-factored sabbath will---when their body breaks up, after
death---be reborn in the company of the gods of Yama. This is what I was
referring to when I said: 'Human kingship is a poor thing compared to
the happiness of the gods.'

Four hundred years in the human realm is one day and night for the
joyful gods. Thirty such days make up a month. Twelve such months make
up a year. The lifespan of the joyful gods is four thousand of these
heavenly years. It's possible that some woman or man who has observed
the eight-factored sabbath will---when their body breaks up, after
death---be reborn in the company of the joyful gods. This is what I was
referring to when I said: 'Human kingship is a poor thing compared to
the happiness of the gods.'

Eight hundred years in the human realm is one day and night for the gods
who love to imagine. Thirty such days make up a month. Twelve such
months make up a year. The lifespan of the gods who love to imagine is
eight thousand of these heavenly years. It's possible that some woman or
man who has observed the eight-factored sabbath will---when their body
breaks up, after death---be reborn in the company of the gods who love
to imagine. This is what I was referring to when I said: 'Human kingship
is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.'

Sixteen hundred years in the human realm is one day and night for the
gods who control what is imagined by others. Thirty such days make up a
month. Twelve such months make up a year. The lifespan of the gods who
control what is imagined by others is sixteen thousand of these heavenly
years. It's possible that some woman or man who has observed the
eight-factored sabbath will---when their body breaks up, after
death---be reborn in the company of the gods who control what is
imagined by others. This is what I was referring to when I said: 'Human
kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.'

### AN 8.43 With Visākhā on the Sabbath  *Visākhāsutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the
stilt longhouse of Migāra's mother in the Eastern
Monastery. Then Visākhā, Migāra's mother, went
up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to
her:

"Visākhā, the observance of the sabbath with its eight

thousand of these divine years. It's possible that some woman or man who
has observed the eight-factored sabbath will---when their body breaks
up, after death---be reborn in the company of the gods of the
thirty-three. This is what I was referring to when I said: 'Human

### AN 8.44 With Vāseṭṭha on the Sabbath  *Vāseṭṭhasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the
Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then the layman
Vāseṭṭha went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one
side. The Buddha said to him:

"Vāseṭṭha, the observance of the sabbath with its eight
factors is very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful ...
blameless, they go to a heavenly place."

When he said this, Vāseṭṭha said to the Buddha:

"If my loved ones---relatives and kin---were to observe this sabbath
with its eight factors, it would be for their lasting welfare and
happiness. If all the aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials were
to observe this sabbath with its eight factors, it would be for their
lasting welfare and happiness."

"That's so true, Vāseṭṭha! That's so true,
Vāseṭṭha! If all the aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and
menials were to observe this sabbath with its eight factors, it would be
for their lasting welfare and happiness. If the whole world---with its
gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its
ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans---were to observe this sabbath
with its eight factors, it would be for their lasting welfare and
happiness. If these great sal trees were to observe this sabbath with
its eight factors, it would be for their lasting welfare and
happiness---if they were sentient. How much more then a human being!"

### AN 8.45 With Bojjhā on the Sabbath  *Bojjhasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Then the laywoman
Bojjhā went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one
side. The Buddha said to her:

"Bojjhā, the observance of the sabbath with its eight

how should it be observed?

It's when a noble disciple reflects: 'As long as they live, the

### AN 8.46 Anuruddha and the Agreeable Deities  *Anuruddhasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī, in
Ghosita's Monastery.

Now at that time Venerable Anuruddha had gone into retreat for the day's
meditation. Then several deities of the Agreeable Host went up to
Venerable Anuruddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:

"Honorable Anuruddha, we are the deities called 'Agreeable'. We wield
authority and control over three things. We can turn any color we want
on the spot. We can get any voice that we want on the spot. We can get
any pleasure that we want on the spot. We are the deities called
'Agreeable'. We wield authority and control over these three things."

Then Venerable Anuruddha thought, "If only these deities would all turn
blue, of blue color, clad in blue, adorned with blue!" Then those
deities, knowing Anuruddha's thought, all turned blue.

Then Venerable Anuruddha thought, "If only these deities would all turn
yellow ..."

"If only these gods would all turn red ..."

"If only these gods would all turn white ..." Then those deities,
knowing Anuruddha's thought, all turned white.

Then one of those deities sang, one danced, and one snapped her fingers.
Suppose there was a quintet made up of skilled musicians who had
practiced well and kept excellent rhythm. They'd sound graceful,
tantalizing, sensuous, lovely, and intoxicating. In the same way the
performance by those deities sounded graceful, tantalizing, sensuous,
lovely, and intoxicating. But Venerable Anuruddha averted his senses.

Then those deities, thinking "Master Anuruddha isn't enjoying this,"
vanished right there. Then in the late afternoon, Anuruddha came out of
retreat and went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told
him what had happened, adding:

"How many qualities do females have so that---when their body breaks up,
after death---they are reborn in company with the Gods of the Agreeable
Host?"

"Anuruddha, when they have eight qualities females---when their body
breaks up, after death---are reborn in company with the Gods of the
Agreeable Host. What eight?

Take the case of a female whose mother and father give her to a husband
wanting what's best for her, out of kindness and sympathy. She would get
up before him and go to bed after him, and be obliging, behaving nicely
and speaking politely.

She honors, respects, esteems, and venerates those her husband respects,
such as mother and father, and ascetics and brahmins. And when they
arrive she serves them with a seat and water.

She's deft and tireless in her husband's household duties, such as
knitting and sewing. She understands how to go about things in order to
complete and organize the work.

She knows what work her husband's domestic bondservants, servants, and
workers have completed, and what they've left incomplete. She knows who
is sick, and who is fit or unwell. She distributes to each a fair
portion of fresh and cooked foods.

She ensures that any income her husband earns is guarded and protected,
whether money, grain, silver, or gold. She doesn't overspend, steal,
waste, or lose it.

She's a lay follower who has gone for refuge to the Buddha, his
teaching, and the Saṅgha.

She's ethical. She doesn't kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual
misconduct, lie, or consume beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants.

She's generous. She lives at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely
generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to
give and to share.

When they have these eight qualities females---when their body breaks
up, after death---are reborn in company with the Gods of the Agreeable
Host.

> She'd never look down on her husband,\
> who's always eager to work hard,\
> always looking after her,\
> and bringing whatever she wants.
>
> And a good woman never scolds her husband\
> with jealous words.\
> Being astute, she reveres\
> those respected by her husband.
>
> She gets up early, works tirelessly,\
> and manages the domestic help.\
> She's agreeable to her husband,\
> and preserves his wealth.
>
> A lady who fulfills these duties\
> according to her husband's desire,\
> is reborn among the gods\
> called 'Agreeable'."

### AN 8.48 With Nakula's Mother on the Agreeable Gods  *Nakulamātāsutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas at
Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā's Wood. Then
the housewife Nakula's mother went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down
to one side. The Buddha said to her:

"Nakula's mother, when they have eight qualities females---when their

### AN 8.49 Winning in This Life (1st)  *Paṭhamaidhalokikasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the
stilt longhouse of Migāra's mother in the Eastern
Monastery. Then Visākhā, Migāra's mother, went
up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to
her:

"Visākhā, a female who has four qualities is practicing to
win in this life, and she succeeds at it. What four? It's when a female
is well-organized at work, manages the domestic help, acts lovingly
toward her husband, and preserves his earnings.

And how is a female well-organized at work? It's when she's deft and
tireless in doing domestic duties for her husband, such as knitting and
sewing. She understands how to go about things in order to complete and
organize the work. That's how a female is well-organized at work.

And how does a female manage the domestic help? It's when she knows what
work her husband's domestic bondservants, servants, and workers have
completed, and what they've left incomplete. She knows who is sick, and
who is fit or unwell. She distributes to each a fair portion of fresh
