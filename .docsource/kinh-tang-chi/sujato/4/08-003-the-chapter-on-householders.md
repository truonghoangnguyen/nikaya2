# The Chapter on Householders

### AN 8.21 With Ugga of Vesālī  *Paṭhamauggasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the
Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. There the Buddha addressed
the mendicants: "Mendicants, you should remember the householder Ugga of
Vesālī as someone who has eight amazing and incredible
qualities."

That is what the Buddha said. When he had spoken, the Holy One got up
from his seat and entered his dwelling.

Then a certain mendicant robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl
and robe, went to the home of the householder Ugga of
Vesālī, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then Ugga of
Vesālī went up to that mendicant, bowed, and sat down to
one side. The mendicant said to him:

"Householder, the Buddha declared that you have eight amazing and
incredible qualities. What are the eight qualities that he spoke of?"

"Sir, I don't know what eight amazing and incredible qualities the
Buddha was referring to. But these eight amazing and incredible
qualities are found in me. Listen and apply your mind well, I will
speak."

"Yes, householder," replied the mendicant. Ugga of Vesālī
said this:

"Sir, when I first saw the Buddha off in the distance, my heart was
inspired as soon as I saw him. This is the first incredible and amazing
quality found in me.

With confident heart I paid homage to the Buddha. The Buddha taught me
step by step, with a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He
explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and
the benefit of renunciation. And when he knew that my mind was ready,
pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the
special teaching of the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation,
and the path. Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb
dye, in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma
arose in me: 'Everything that has a beginning has an end.' I saw,
attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. I went beyond doubt, got
rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others
regarding the Teacher's instructions. Right there I went for refuge to
the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha. And I undertook
the five training rules with celibacy as the fifth. This is the second
incredible and amazing quality found in me.

I had four teenage wives. And I went to them and said: 'Sisters, I've
undertaken the five training rules with celibacy as fifth. If you wish,
you may stay here, enjoy my wealth, and do good deeds. Or you can return
to your own families. Or would you prefer if I gave you to another man?'
When I said this, my eldest wife said to me: 'Master, please give me to
such-and-such a man.' Then I summoned that man. Taking my wife with my
left hand and a ceremonial vase with my right, I presented her to that
man with the pouring of water. But I can't recall getting upset while
giving away my teenage wife. This is the third incredible and amazing
quality found in me.

And though my family has wealth, it's shared without reserve with
ethical people of good character. This is the fourth incredible and
amazing quality found in me.

When I pay homage to a mendicant, I do so carefully, not carelessly.
This is the fifth incredible and amazing quality found in me.

If that venerable teaches me the Dhamma, I listen carefully, not
carelessly. But if they don't teach me the Dhamma, I teach them. This is
the sixth incredible and amazing quality found in me.

It's not unusual for deities to come to me and announce: 'Householder,
the Buddha's teaching is well explained!' When they say this I say to
them: 'The Buddha's teaching is well explained, regardless of whether or
not you deities say so!' But I don't recall getting too excited by the
fact that the deities come to me, and I have a conversation with them.
This is the seventh incredible and amazing quality found in me.

Of the five lower fetters taught by the Buddha, I don't see any that I
haven't given up. This is the eighth incredible and amazing quality
found in me.

These eight amazing and incredible qualities are found in me. But I
don't know what eight amazing and incredible qualities the Buddha was
referring to."

Then that mendicant, after taking almsfood in Ugga of
Vesālī's home, got up from his seat and left. Then after
the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed,
and sat down to one side. He informed the Buddha of all he had discussed
with the householder Ugga of Vesālī. The Buddha said:

"Good, good, mendicant! When I declared that the householder Ugga of
Vesālī was someone who has eight amazing and incredible
qualities, I was referring to the same eight qualities that he rightly
explained to you. You should remember the householder Ugga of
Vesālī as someone who has these eight amazing and
incredible qualities."

### AN 8.22 With Ugga of Elephant Village  *Dutiyauggasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Vajjis at Elephant
Village. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: "Mendicants, you
should remember the householder Ugga of Elephant Village as someone who
has eight amazing and incredible qualities."

That is what the Buddha said. When he had spoken, the Holy One got up
from his seat and entered his dwelling.

Then a certain mendicant robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl
and robe, went to the home of the householder Ugga of Elephant Village,
where he sat on the seat spread out. Then Ugga of Elephant Village went
up to that mendicant, bowed, and sat down to one side. The mendicant
said to him:

"Householder, the Buddha declared that you have eight amazing and
incredible qualities. What are the eight qualities that he spoke of?"

"Sir, I don't know what eight amazing and incredible qualities the
Buddha was referring to. But these eight amazing and incredible
qualities are found in me. Listen and apply your mind well, I will
speak."

"Yes, householder," replied the mendicant. Ugga of Elephant Village said
this:

"Sir, when I first saw the Buddha off in the distance I was partying in
the Dragon's Park. My heart was inspired as soon as I saw him, and I
sobered up. This is the first incredible and amazing quality found in
me.

With confident heart I paid homage to the Buddha. The Buddha taught me
step by step, with a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He
explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and
the benefit of renunciation. And when he knew that my mind was ready,
pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the
special teaching of the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation,
and the path. Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb
dye, in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma
arose in me: 'Everything that has a beginning has an end.' I saw,
attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. I went beyond doubt, got
rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others
regarding the Teacher's instructions. Right there I went for refuge to
the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha. And I undertook
the five training rules with celibacy as the fifth. This is the second
incredible and amazing quality found in me.

I had four teenage wives. And I went to them and said: 'Sisters, I've
undertaken the five training rules with celibacy as fifth. If you wish,
you may stay here, enjoy my wealth, and do good deeds. Or you can return
to your own families. Or would you prefer if I gave you to another man?'
When I said this, my eldest wife said to me: 'Master, please give me to
such-and-such a man.' Then I summoned that man. Taking my wife with my
left hand and a ceremonial vase with my right, I presented her to that
man with the pouring of water. But I can't recall getting upset while
giving away my teenage wife. This is the third incredible and amazing
quality found in me.

And though my family has wealth, it's shared without reserve with
ethical people of good character. This is the fourth incredible and
amazing quality found in me.

When I pay homage to a mendicant, I do so carefully, not carelessly. If
that venerable teaches me the Dhamma, I listen carefully, not
carelessly. But if they don't teach me the Dhamma, I teach them. This is
the fifth incredible and amazing quality found in me.

It's not unusual for deities to come to me when the Saṅgha
has been invited and announce: 'Householder, that mendicant is freed
both ways. That one is freed by wisdom. That one is a direct witness.
That one is attained to view. That one is freed by faith. That one is a
follower of teachings. That one is a follower by faith. That one is
ethical, of good character. That one is unethical, of bad character.'
But while I'm serving the Saṅgha I don't recall thinking:
'Let me give this one just a little, and that one a lot.' Rather, I give
impartially. This is the sixth incredible and amazing quality found in
me.

It's not unusual for deities to come to me and announce: 'Householder,
the Buddha's teaching is well explained!' When they say this I say to
them: 'The Buddha's teaching is well explained, regardless of whether or
not you deities say so!' But I don't recall getting too excited by the
fact that the deities come to me, and I have a conversation with them.
This is the seventh incredible and amazing quality found in me.

If I pass away before the Buddha, it would be no wonder if the Buddha
declares of me: 'The householder Ugga of Elephant Village is bound by no
fetter that might return him to this world.' This is the eighth
incredible and amazing quality found in me.

These eight amazing and incredible qualities are found in me. But I
don't know what eight amazing and incredible qualities the Buddha was
referring to."

Then that mendicant, after taking almsfood in Ugga of Elephant Village's
home, got up from his seat and left. Then after the meal, on his return
from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
He informed the Buddha of all he had discussed with the householder Ugga
of Elephant Village. The Buddha said:

"Good, good, mendicant! When I declared that the householder Ugga of
Elephant Village was someone who has eight amazing and incredible
qualities, I was referring to the same eight qualities that he rightly
explained to you. You should remember the householder Ugga of Elephant
Village as someone who has these eight amazing and incredible
qualities."

### AN 8.23 With Hatthaka (1st)  *Paṭhamahatthakasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Āḷavī, at the
Aggāḷava Tree-shrine. There the Buddha addressed the
mendicants:

"Mendicants, you should remember the householder Hatthaka of
Āḷavī as someone who has seven amazing and incredible
qualities. What seven? He's faithful, ethical, conscientious, prudent,
learned, generous, and wise. You should remember the householder
Hatthaka of Āḷavī as someone who has these seven amazing
and incredible qualities."

That is what the Buddha said. When he had spoken, the Holy One got up
from his seat and entered his dwelling.

Then a certain mendicant robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl
and robe, went to the home of the householder Hatthaka of
Āḷavī, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then Hatthaka
went up to that mendicant, bowed, and sat down to one side. The
mendicant said to Hatthaka:

"Householder, the Buddha declared that you have seven amazing and
incredible qualities. What seven? He said that you're faithful, ethical,
conscientious, prudent, learned, generous, and wise. The Buddha declared
that you have these seven amazing and incredible qualities."

"But sir, I trust that no white-clothed lay people were present?"

"No, there weren't any white-clothed lay people present."

"That's good, sir."

Then that mendicant, after taking almsfood in Hatthaka of
Āḷavī's home, got up from his seat and left. Then after the
meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat
down to one side, and told him of what he had discussed with the
householder Hatthaka. The Buddha said:

"Good, good, mendicant! That gentleman has few wishes. He doesn't want
his own good qualities to be made known to others. Well then, mendicant,
you should remember the householder Hatthaka of Āḷavī as
someone who has this eighth amazing and incredible quality, that is,
fewness of wishes."

<!--pg-->
### AN 8.24 With Hatthaka (2nd)  *Dutiyahatthakasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Āḷavī, at the
Aggāḷava Tree-shrine. Then the householder Hatthaka of
Āḷavī, escorted by around five hundred lay followers, went
up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to
Hatthaka:

"Hatthaka, you have a large congregation. How do you bring together such
a large congregation?"

"Sir, I bring together such a large congregation by using the four ways
of being inclusive as taught by the Buddha. When I know that a person
can be included by a gift, I include them by giving a gift. When I know
that a person can be included by kindly words, I include them by kindly
words. When I know that a person can be included by taking care of them,
I include them by caring for them. When I know that a person can be
included by equality, I include them by treating them equally. But also,
sir, my family is wealthy. They wouldn't think that a poor person was
worth listening to in the same way."

"Good, good, Hatthaka! This is the right way to bring together a large
congregation. Whether in the past, future, or present, all those who
have brought together a large congregation have done so by using these
four ways of being inclusive."

Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Hatthaka of
Āḷavī with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his
seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha before leaving. Then,
not long after Hatthaka had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
"Mendicants, you should remember the householder Hatthaka of
Āḷavī as someone who has eight amazing and incredible
qualities. What eight? He's faithful, ethical, conscientious, prudent,
learned, generous, wise, and has few wishes. You should remember the
householder Hatthaka of Āḷavī as someone who has these
eight amazing and incredible qualities."

### AN 8.25 With Mahānāma  *Mahānāmasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near
Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. Then Mahānāma
the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said
to him:

"Sir, how is a lay follower defined?"

"Mahānāma, when you've gone for refuge to the Buddha, the
teaching, and the Saṅgha, you're considered to be a lay
follower."

"But how is an ethical lay follower defined?"

"When a lay follower doesn't kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual
misconduct, lie, or consume beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants, they're
considered to be an ethical lay follower."

"But how do we define a lay follower who is practicing to benefit
themselves, not others?"

"A lay follower is accomplished in faith, but doesn't encourage others
to do the same. They're accomplished in ethical conduct, but don't
encourage others to do the same. They're accomplished in generosity, but
don't encourage others to do the same. They like to see the mendicants,
but don't encourage others to do the same. They like to hear the true
teaching, but don't encourage others to do the same. They readily
memorize the teachings they've heard, but don't encourage others to do
the same. They examine the meaning of the teachings they've memorized,
but don't encourage others to do the same. Understanding the meaning and
the teaching, they practice accordingly, but they don't encourage others
to do the same. That's how we define a lay follower who is practicing to
benefit themselves, not others."

"But how do we define a lay follower who is practicing to benefit both
themselves and others?"

"A lay follower is accomplished in faith and encourages others to do the
same. They're accomplished in ethical conduct and encourage others to do
the same. They're accomplished in generosity and encourage others to do
the same. They like to see the mendicants and encourage others to do the
same. They like to hear the true teaching and encourage others to do the
same. They readily memorize the teachings they've heard and encourage
others to do the same. They examine the meaning of the teachings they've
memorized and encourage others to do the same. Understanding the meaning
and the teaching, they practice accordingly and they encourage others to
do the same. That's how we define a lay follower who is practicing to
benefit both themselves and others."

### AN 8.26 With Jīvaka  *Jīvakasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in
Jīvaka's Mango Grove. Then Jīvaka
Komārabhacca went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to him, "Sir, how is a lay follower defined?"

"Jīvaka, when you've gone for refuge to the Buddha, the
teaching, and the Saṅgha, you're considered to be a lay
follower."

"But how is an ethical lay follower defined?"

"When a lay follower doesn't kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual
misconduct, lie, or consume beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants, they're
considered to be an ethical lay follower."

"But how do we define a lay follower who is practicing to benefit
themselves, not others?"

"A lay follower is accomplished in faith, but doesn't encourage others
to do the same. They're accomplished in ethical conduct ... they're
accomplished in generosity ... they like to see the mendicants ... they
like to hear the true teaching ... they memorize the teachings ... they
examine the meaning ... Understanding the meaning and the teaching, they
practice accordingly, but they don't encourage others to do the same.
That's how we define a lay follower who is practicing to benefit
themselves, not others."

"But how do we define a lay follower who is practicing to benefit both
themselves and others?"

"A lay follower is accomplished in faith and encourages others to do the
same. They're accomplished in ethical conduct and encourage others to do
the same. They're accomplished in generosity and encourage others to do
the same. They like to see the mendicants and encourage others to do the
same. They like to hear the true teaching and encourage others to do the
same. They readily memorize the teachings they've heard and encourage
others to do the same. They examine the meaning of the teachings they've
memorized and encourage others to do the same. Understanding the meaning
and the teaching, they practice accordingly and they encourage others to
do the same. That's how we define a lay follower who is practicing to
benefit both themselves and others."

### AN 8.27 Powers (1st)  *Paṭhamabalasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these eight powers. What eight? Crying is the
power of babies. Anger is the power of females. Weapons are the power of
bandits. Authority is the power of rulers. Complaining is the power of
fools. Reason is the power of the astute. Reflection is the power of the
learned. Patience is the power of ascetics and brahmins. These are the
eight powers."

<!--pg-->
### AN 8.28 Powers (2nd)  *Dutiyabalasutta*

Then Venerable Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, and
sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:

"Sāriputta, how many powers does a mendicant who has ended
the defilements have that qualify them to claim: 'My defilements have
ended'?"

"Sir, a mendicant who has ended the defilements has eight powers that
qualify them to claim: 'My defilements have ended.'

What eight? Firstly, a mendicant with defilements ended has clearly seen
with right wisdom all conditions as truly impermanent. This is a power
that a mendicant who has ended the defilements relies on to claim: 'My
defilements have ended.'

Furthermore, a mendicant with defilements ended has clearly seen with
right wisdom that sensual pleasures are truly like a pit of glowing
coals. This is a power that a mendicant who has ended the defilements
relies on to claim: 'My defilements have ended.'

Furthermore, the mind of a mendicant with defilements ended slants,
slopes, and inclines to seclusion. They're withdrawn, loving
renunciation, and have totally eliminated defiling influences. This is a
power that a mendicant who has ended the defilements relies on to claim:
'My defilements have ended.'

Furthermore, a mendicant with defilements ended has well developed the
four kinds of mindfulness meditation. This is a power that a mendicant
who has ended the defilements relies on to claim: 'My defilements have
ended.'

Furthermore, a mendicant with defilements ended has well developed the
four bases of psychic power ... the five faculties ... the seven
awakening factors ... the noble eightfold path. This is a power that a
mendicant who has ended the defilements relies on to claim: 'My
defilements have ended.'

A mendicant who has ended the defilements has these eight powers that
qualify them to claim: 'My defilements have ended.'"

<!--pg-->
### AN 8.29 Lost Opportunities  *Akkhaṇasutta*

"'Now is the time! Now is the time!' So says an unlearned ordinary
person. But they don't know whether it's time or not. Mendicants, there
are eight lost opportunities for spiritual practice. What eight?

Firstly, a Realized One has arisen in the world---perfected, a fully
awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of
the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods
and humans, awakened, blessed. He teaches the Dhamma leading to peace,
extinguishment, awakening, as proclaimed by the Holy One. But a person
has been reborn in hell. This is the first lost opportunity for
spiritual practice.

Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world. But a person has
been reborn in the animal realm. This is the second lost opportunity.

Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world. But a person has
been reborn in the ghost realm. This is the third lost opportunity.

Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world. But a person has
been reborn in one of the long-lived orders of gods. This is the fourth
lost opportunity.

Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world. But a person has
been reborn in the borderlands, among uneducated foreigners, where
monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen do not go. This is the fifth lost
opportunity ...

Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world. And a person is
reborn in a central country. But they have wrong view and distorted
perspective: 'There's no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings.
There's no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There's no afterlife.
There's no such thing as mother and father, or beings that are reborn
spontaneously. And there's no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly
comported and rightly practiced, and who describes the afterlife after
realizing it with their own insight.' This is the sixth lost opportunity
...

Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world. And a person is
reborn in a central country. But they're witless, dull, idiotic, and
unable to distinguish what is well said from what is poorly said. This
is the seventh lost opportunity ...

Furthermore, a Realized One has not arisen in the world ... So he
doesn't teach the Dhamma leading to peace, extinguishment, awakening, as
proclaimed by the Holy One. And a person is reborn in a central country.
And they're wise, bright, clever, and able to distinguish what is well
said from what is poorly said. This is the eighth lost opportunity ...

There are these eight lost opportunities for spiritual practice.

Mendicants, there is just one opportunity for spiritual practice. What
is that one? It's when a Realized One has arisen in the world,
perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and
conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to
train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. He teaches the
Dhamma leading to peace, extinguishment, awakening, as proclaimed by the
Holy One. And a person is reborn in a central country. And they're wise,
bright, clever, and able to distinguish what is well said from what is
poorly said. This is the one opportunity for spiritual practice.

> When you've gained the human state,\
> and the true teaching has been so well proclaimed,\
> those who don't seize the moment\
> are wasting their time.
>
> For many wrong times are spoken of,\
> which obstruct the path.\
> Only on rare occasions\

>
> If you find yourself in their presence,\

>
> Those who've gained the human state\

### AN 8.30 Anuruddha and the Great Thoughts  *Anuruddhamahāvitakkasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas at
Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā's Wood. And
at that time Venerable Anuruddha was staying in the land of the
Cetīs in the Eastern Bamboo Park. Then as Anuruddha was in
private retreat this thought came to his mind:

"This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of many wishes.
It's for the contented, not those who lack contentment. It's for the
secluded, not those who enjoy company. It's for the energetic, not the
lazy. It's for the mindful, not the unmindful. It's for those with
immersion, not those without immersion. It's for the wise, not the
witless."

Then the Buddha knew what Anuruddha was thinking. As easily as a strong
person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the deer
park at Bhesakaḷā's Wood in the land of the Bhaggas and
reappeared in front of Anuruddha in the Eastern Bamboo Park in the land
of the Cetīs, and sat on the seat spread out. Anuruddha
bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:

"Good, good, Anuruddha! It's good that you reflect on these thoughts of
a great man: 'This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of
many wishes. It's for the contented, not those who lack contentment.
It's for the secluded, not those who enjoy company. It's for the
energetic, not the lazy. It's for the mindful, not the unmindful. It's
for those with immersion, not those without immersion. It's for the
wise, not the witless.' Well then, Anuruddha, you should also reflect on
the following eighth thought of a great man: 'This teaching is for those
who don't enjoy proliferating and don't like to proliferate, not for
those who enjoy proliferating and like to proliferate.'

First you'll reflect on these eight thoughts of a great man. Then
whenever you want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unskillful qualities, you'll enter and remain in the first absorption,
which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the
mind and keeping it connected.

You'll enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture
and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one,
without placing the mind and keeping it connected.

You'll enter and remain in the third absorption, where you'll meditate
with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of
which the noble ones declare, 'Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in
bliss.'

Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness,
you'll enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or
pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.

First you'll reflect on these eight thoughts of a great man, and you'll
get the four absorptions---blissful meditations in this life that belong
to the higher mind---when you want, without trouble or difficulty. Then
as you live contented your rag robe will seem to you like a chest full
of garments of different colors seems to a householder or householder's
child. It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for
alighting upon extinguishment.

As you live contented your scraps of almsfood will seem to you like
boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out, served with many soups
and sauces seems to a householder or householder's child. It will be for
your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon
extinguishment.

As you live contented your lodging at the root of a tree will seem to
you like a bungalow, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with door
fastened and window shuttered seems to a householder or householder's
child. It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for
alighting upon extinguishment.

As you live contented your lodging at the root of a tree will seem to
you like a couch spread with woolen covers---shag-piled, pure white, or
embroidered with flowers---and spread with a fine deer hide, with a
canopy above and red pillows at both ends seems to a householder or
householder's child. It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort,
and for alighting upon extinguishment.

As you live contented your rancid urine as medicine will seem to you
like various medicines---ghee, butter, oil, honey, and molasses---seem
to a householder or householder's child. It will be for your enjoyment,
relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment. Well then,
Anuruddha, for the next rainy season residence you should stay right
here in the land of the Cetīs in the Eastern Bamboo Park."

"Yes, sir," Anuruddha replied.

After advising Anuruddha like this, the Buddha---as easily as a strong
person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Eastern
Bamboo Park in the land of the Cetīs and reappeared in the
deer park at Bhesakaḷā's Wood in the land of the Bhaggas.
He sat on the seat spread out and addressed the mendicants: "Mendicants,
I will teach you the eight thoughts of a great man. Listen ...

And what are the eight thoughts of a great man? This teaching is for
those of few wishes, not those of many wishes. It's for the contented,
not those who lack contentment. It's for the secluded, not those who
enjoy company. It's for the energetic, not the lazy. It's for the
mindful, not the unmindful. It's for those with immersion, not those
without immersion. It's for the wise, not the witless. It's for those
who don't enjoy proliferating and don't like to proliferate, not for
those who enjoy proliferating and like to proliferate.

'This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of many wishes.'
That's what I said, but why did I say it? A mendicant with few wishes
doesn't wish: 'May they know me as having few wishes!' When contented,
they don't wish: 'May they know me as contented!' When secluded, they
don't wish: 'May they know me as secluded!' When energetic, they don't
wish: 'May they know me as energetic!' When mindful, they don't wish:
'May they know me as mindful!' When immersed, they don't wish: 'May they
know me as immersed!' When wise, they don't wish: 'May they know me as
wise!' When not enjoying proliferation, they don't wish: 'May they know
me as one who doesn't enjoy proliferating!' 'This teaching is for those
of few wishes, not those of many wishes.' That's what I said, and this
is why I said it.

'This teaching is for the contented, not those who lack contentment.'
That's what I said, but why did I say it? It's for a mendicant who's
content with any kind of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and
supplies for the sick. 'This teaching is for the contented, not those
who lack contentment.' That's what I said, and this is why I said it.

'This teaching is for the secluded, not those who enjoy company.' That's
what I said, but why did I say it? It's for a mendicant who lives
secluded. But monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, rulers and their chief
ministers, monastics of other religions and their disciples go to visit
them. With a mind slanting, sloping, and inclining to seclusion,
withdrawn, and loving renunciation, that mendicant invariably gives each
of them a talk emphasizing the topic of dismissal. 'This teaching is for
the secluded, not those who enjoy company.' That's what I said, and this
is why I said it.

'This teaching is for the energetic, not the lazy.' That's what I said,
but why did I say it? It's for a mendicant who lives with energy roused
up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities.
They're strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to
developing skillful qualities. 'This teaching is for the energetic, not
the lazy.' That's what I said, and this is why I said it.

'This teaching is for the mindful, not the unmindful.' That's what I
said, but why did I say it? It's for a mendicant who's mindful. They
have utmost mindfulness and alertness, and can remember and recall what
was said and done long ago. 'This teaching is for the mindful, not the
unmindful.' That's what I said, and this is why I said it.

'This teaching is for those with immersion, not those without
immersion.' That's what I said, but why did I say it? It's for a
mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption ...
second absorption ... third absorption ... fourth absorption. 'This
teaching is for those with immersion, not those without immersion.'
That's what I said, and this is why I said it.

'This teaching is for the wise, not the witless.' That's what I said,
but why did I say it? It's for a mendicant who's wise. They have the
wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and
leads to the complete ending of suffering. 'This teaching is for the
wise, not the witless.' That's what I said, and this is why I said it.

'This teaching is for those who don't enjoy proliferating and don't like
to proliferate, not for those who enjoy proliferating and like to
proliferate.' That's what I said, but why did I say it? It's for a
mendicant whose mind leaps forth, gains confidence, settles down, and
becomes decided regarding the cessation of proliferation. 'This teaching
is for those who don't enjoy proliferating and don't like to
proliferate, not for those who enjoy proliferating and like to
proliferate.' That's what I said, and this is why I said it."

Then Anuruddha stayed the next rainy season residence right there in the
land of the Cetīs in the Eastern Bamboo Park. And
Anuruddha, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon
realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very
life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which
gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.

He understood: "Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been
completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further
for this place." And Venerable Anuruddha became one of the perfected.
And on the occasion of attaining perfection he recited these verses:

> "Knowing my thoughts,\
> the supreme Teacher in the world\
> came to me in a mind-made body,\
> using his psychic power.
>
> He taught me more\
> than I had thought of.\
> The Buddha who loves non-proliferation\
> taught me non-proliferation.
>
> Understanding that teaching,\
> I happily did his bidding.\
> I've attained the three knowledges,\
> and have fulfilled the Buddha's instructions."
