# The Chapter on Love

### AN 8.1 The Benefits of Love  *Mettāsutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, you can expect eight benefits when the heart's release by
love has been cultivated, developed, and practiced, made a vehicle and a
basis, kept up, consolidated, and properly implemented. What eight? You
sleep at ease. You wake happily. You don't have bad dreams. Humans love
you. Non-humans love you. Deities protect you. You can't be harmed by
fire, poison, or blade. If you don't reach any higher, you'll be reborn
in a realm of divinity. You can expect these eight benefits when the
heart's release by love has been cultivated, developed, and practiced,
made a vehicle and a basis, kept up, consolidated, and properly
implemented.

> A mindful one who develops\
> limitless love\
> weakens the fetters,\
> seeing the ending of attachments.
>
> Loving just one creature with a hateless heart\
> makes you a true person.\
> Sympathetic for all creatures,\
> a noble one creates abundant merit.
>
> The royal potentates conquered this land\
> and traveled around sponsoring sacrifices---\
> horse sacrifice, human sacrifice,\
> the sacrifices of the 'casting of the yoke-pin', the 'royal soma
> drinking', and the 'unimpeded'.
>
> These are not worth a sixteenth part\
> of the mind developed with love,\
> as all the constellations of stars\
> aren't worth a sixteenth part of the moon's light.
>
> Don't kill or cause others to kill,\
> don't conquer or encourage others to conquer,\
> with love for all sentient beings,\
> you'll have no enmity for anyone."

### AN 8.2 Wisdom  *Paññāsutta*

"Mendicants, there are eight causes and reasons that lead to acquiring
the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life, and to its increase,
growth, and full development once it has been acquired. What eight?

It's when a mendicant lives relying on the Teacher or a spiritual
companion in a teacher's role. And they set up a keen sense of
conscience and prudence for them, with warmth and respect. This is the
first cause.

When a mendicant lives relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion
in a teacher's role---with a keen sense of conscience and prudence for
them, with warmth and respect---from time to time they go and ask them
questions: 'Why, sir, does it say this? What does that mean?' Those
venerables clarify what is unclear, reveal what is obscure, and dispel
doubt regarding the many doubtful matters. This is the second cause.

After hearing that teaching they perfect withdrawal of both body and
mind. This is the third cause.

A mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting
themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger
in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they've undertaken. This is
the fourth cause.

They're very learned, remembering and keeping what they've learned.
These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good
in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice
that's entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings,
remembering them, rehearsing them, mentally scrutinizing them, and
comprehending them theoretically. This is the fifth cause.

They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and
embracing skillful qualities. They're strong, staunchly vigorous, not
slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. This is the
sixth cause.

When in the Saṅgha they don't engage in motley talk or low
talk. Either they talk on Dhamma, or they invite someone else to do so,
or they respect noble silence. This is the seventh cause.

They meditate observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates.
'Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form.
Such is feeling, such is the origin of feeling, such is the ending of
feeling. Such is perception, such is the origin of perception, such is
the ending of perception. Such are choices, such is the origin of
choices, such is the ending of choices. Such is consciousness, such is
the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.' This
is the eighth cause.

Their spiritual companions esteem them: 'This venerable lives relying on
the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher's role. They set up a
keen sense of conscience and prudence for them, with warmth and respect.
Clearly this venerable knows and sees.' This quality leads to fondness,
respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.

'This venerable lives relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion in
a teacher's role, and from time to time they go and ask them questions
... Clearly this venerable knows and sees.' This quality also leads to
fondness, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.

'After hearing that teaching they perfect withdrawal of both body and
mind. Clearly this venerable knows and sees.' This quality also leads to
fondness, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.

'This venerable is ethical ... Clearly this venerable knows and sees.'
This quality also leads to fondness, respect, esteem, harmony, and
unity.

'This venerable is very learned, remembering and keeping what they've
learned. ... Clearly this venerable knows and sees.' This quality also
leads to fondness, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.

'This venerable lives with energy roused up ... Clearly this venerable
knows and sees.' This quality also leads to fondness, respect, esteem,
harmony, and unity.

'When in the Saṅgha they don't engage in motley talk or low
talk. Either they talk on Dhamma, or they invite someone else to do so,
or they respect noble silence. Clearly this venerable knows and sees.'
This quality also leads to fondness, respect, esteem, harmony, and
unity.

'They meditate observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates.
... Clearly this venerable knows and sees.' This quality also leads to
fondness, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.

These are the eight causes and reasons that lead to acquiring the wisdom
fundamental to the spiritual life, and to its increase, growth, and full
development once it has been acquired."

### AN 8.3 Disliked (1st)  *Paṭhamaappiyasutta*

"Mendicants, a mendicant with eight qualities is disliked and
disapproved by their spiritual companions, not respected or admired.
What eight? It's when a mendicant praises the disliked and criticizes
the liked. They desire material things and honor. They lack conscience
and prudence. They have corrupt wishes and wrong view. A mendicant with
these eight qualities is disliked and disapproved by their spiritual
companions, not respected or admired.

A mendicant with eight qualities is liked and approved by their
spiritual companions, and respected and admired. What eight? It's when a
mendicant doesn't praise the disliked and criticize the liked. They
don't desire material things and honor. They have conscience and
prudence. They have few desires and right view. A mendicant with these
eight qualities is liked and approved by their spiritual companions, and
respected and admired."

<!--pg-->
### AN 8.4 Disliked (2nd)  *Dutiyaappiyasutta*

"Mendicants, a mendicant with eight qualities is disliked and
disapproved by their spiritual companions, not respected or admired.
What eight? It's when a mendicant desires material things, honor, and
status. They know neither moderation nor the proper time. Their conduct
is impure, they talk a lot, and they insult and abuse their spiritual
companions. A mendicant with these eight qualities is disliked and
disapproved by their spiritual companions, not respected or admired.

### AN 8.5 Worldly Conditions (1st)  *Paṭhamalokadhammasutta*

"Mendicants, the eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and
the world revolves around the eight worldly conditions. What eight? Gain
and loss, fame and disgrace, blame and praise, pleasure and pain. These
eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and the world
revolves around these eight worldly conditions.

> Gain and loss, fame and disgrace,\
> blame and praise, and pleasure and pain.\
> These qualities among people are impermanent,\
> transient, and perishable.
>
> An intelligent and mindful person knows these things,\
> seeing that they're perishable.\
> Desirable things don't disturb their mind,\
> nor are they repelled by the undesirable.
>
> Both favoring and opposing\
> are cleared and ended, they are no more.\
> Knowing the stainless, sorrowless state,\
> they who have gone beyond rebirth\
> \>understand rightly."

<!--pg-->
### AN 8.6 Worldly Conditions (2nd)  *Dutiyalokadhammasutta*

"Mendicants, the eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and
the world revolves around the eight worldly conditions. What eight? Gain
and loss, fame and disgrace, blame and praise, pleasure and pain. These
eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and the world
revolves around these eight worldly conditions.

An unlearned ordinary person encounters gain and loss, fame and
disgrace, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain. And so does a learned
noble disciple. What, then, is the difference between a learned noble
disciple and an ordinary unlearned person?"

"Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge.
Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The
mendicants will listen and remember it."

"Well then, mendicants, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, an unlearned ordinary person encounters gain. They don't
reflect: 'I've encountered this gain. It's impermanent, suffering, and
perishable.' They don't truly understand it. They encounter loss ...
fame ... disgrace ... blame ... praise ... pleasure ... pain. They don't
reflect: 'I've encountered this pain. It's impermanent, suffering, and
perishable.' They don't truly understand it.

So gain and loss, fame and disgrace, blame and praise, and pleasure and
pain occupy their mind. They favor gain and oppose loss. They favor fame
and oppose disgrace. They favor praise and oppose blame. They favor
pleasure and oppose pain. Being so full of favoring and opposing,
they're not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow,
lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They're not freed from
suffering, I say.

A learned noble disciple encounters gain. They reflect: 'I've
encountered this gain. It's impermanent, suffering, and perishable.'
They truly understand it. They encounter loss ... fame ... disgrace ...
blame ... praise ... pleasure ... pain. They reflect: 'I've encountered
this pain. It's impermanent, suffering, and perishable.' They truly
understand it.

So gain and loss, fame and disgrace, blame and praise, and pleasure and
pain don't occupy their mind. They don't favor gain or oppose loss. They
don't favor fame or oppose disgrace. They don't favor praise or oppose
blame. They don't favor pleasure or oppose pain. Having given up
favoring and opposing, they're freed from rebirth, old age, and death,
from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They're freed
from suffering, I say. This is the difference between a learned noble
disciple and an unlearned ordinary person.

> Gain and loss, fame and disgrace,\
> blame and praise, and pleasure and pain.\
> These qualities among people are impermanent,\
> transient, and perishable.
>
> An intelligent and mindful person knows these things,\
> seeing that they're perishable.\
> Desirable things don't disturb their mind,\
> nor are they repelled by the undesirable.

> Both favoring and opposing\
> are cleared and ended, they are no more.\
> Knowing the stainless, sorrowless state,\
> they who have gone beyond rebirth\

### AN 8.7 Devadatta's Failure  *Devadattavipattisutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the
Vulture's Peak Mountain, not long after Devadatta had left. There the
Buddha spoke to the mendicants about Devadatta:

"Mendicants, it's good for a mendicant to check their own failings from
time to time. It's good for a mendicant to check the failings of others
from time to time. It's good for a mendicant to check their own
successes from time to time. It's good for a mendicant to check the
successes of others from time to time. Overcome and overwhelmed by eight
things that oppose the true teaching, Devadatta is going to a place of
loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable.

What eight? Overcome and overwhelmed by gain ... loss ... fame ...
disgrace ... honor ... dishonor ... corrupt wishes ... bad friendship,
Devadatta is going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an
eon, irredeemable. Overcome and overwhelmed by these eight things that
oppose the true teaching, Devadatta is going to a place of loss, to
hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable.

It's good for a mendicant, whenever they encounter it, to overcome gain
... loss ... fame ... disgrace ... honor ... dishonor ... corrupt wishes
... bad friendship.

What advantage does a mendicant gain by overcoming these eight things?

The distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who
lives without overcoming these eight things do not arise when they have
overcome them. This is the advantage that a mendicant gains by
overcoming these eight things.

So, mendicants, you should train like this: 'Whenever we encounter it,
we will overcome gain ... loss ... fame ... disgrace ... honor ...
dishonor ... corrupt wishes ... bad friendship.' That's how you should
train."

### AN 8.8 Uttara on Failure  *Uttaravipattisutta*

At one time Venerable Uttara was staying on the Saṅkheyyaka
Mountain in the Mahisa region near Dhavajālikā. There
Uttara addressed the mendicants: "Mendicants, it's good for a mendicant
to check their own failings from time to time. It's good for a mendicant
to check the failings of others from time to time. It's good for a
mendicant to check their own successes from time to time. It's good for
a mendicant to check the successes of others from time to time."

Now at that time the great king Vessavaṇa was on his way
from the north to the south on some business. He heard Venerable Uttara
teaching this to the mendicants on Saṅkheyyaka Mountain.

Then Vessavaṇa vanished from Saṅkheyyaka
Mountain and appeared among the gods of the thirty-three, as easily as a
strong person would extend or contract their arm. Then he went up to
Sakka, lord of gods, and said to him:

"Please sir, you should know this. Venerable Uttara is teaching the
mendicants on Saṅkheyyaka Mountain in this way: 'It's good
for a mendicant from time to time to check their own failings. ... the
failings of others ... their own successes ... the successes of
others.'"

Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm,
Sakka vanished from the gods of the thirty-three and reappeared on
Saṅkheyyaka Mountain in front of Venerable Uttara. Then
Sakka went up to Venerable Uttara, bowed, stood to one side, and said to
him:

"Is it really true, sir, that you teach the mendicants in this way:
'It's good for a mendicant from time to time to check their own failings
... the failings of others ... their own successes ... the successes of
others'?"

"Indeed, lord of gods."

"Sir, did this teaching come to you from your own inspiration, or was it
spoken by the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened
Buddha?"

"Well then, lord of gods, I shall give you a simile. For by means of a
simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said.

Suppose there was a large heap of grain not far from a town or village.
And a large crowd were to take away grain with carrying poles, baskets,
hip sacks, or their cupped hands. If someone were to go to that crowd
and ask them where they got the grain from, how should that crowd
rightly reply?"

"Sir, they should reply that they took it from the large heap of grain."

"In the same way, lord of gods, whatever is well spoken is spoken by the
Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. Both myself
and others rely completely on that when we speak."

"It's incredible, sir, it's amazing! How well this was said by Venerable
Uttara! 'Whatever is well spoken is spoken by the Blessed One, the
perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. Both myself and others rely
completely on that when we speak.' At one time, Honorable Uttara, the
Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture's Peak
Mountain, not long after Devadatta had left. There the Buddha spoke to
the mendicants about Devadatta:

'Mendicants, it's good for a mendicant from time to time to check their
own failings ... the failings of others ... their own successes ... the
successes of others. Overcome and overwhelmed by eight things that
oppose the true teaching, Devadatta is going to a place of loss, to
hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable. What eight? Overcome and
overwhelmed by gain ... loss ... fame ... disgrace ... honor ...
dishonor ... corrupt wishes ... bad friendship, Devadatta is going to a
place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable.
Overcome and overwhelmed by these eight things that oppose the true
teaching, Devadatta is going to a place of loss, to hell, there to
remain for an eon, irredeemable.

It's good for a mendicant, whenever they encounter it, to overcome gain
... loss ... fame ... disgrace ... honor ... dishonor ... corrupt wishes
... bad friendship.

What advantage does a mendicant gain by overcoming these eight things?

The distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who
lives without overcoming these eight things do not arise when they have
overcome them. This is the advantage that a mendicant gains by
overcoming these eight things.

So you should train like this:

"Whenever we encounter it, we will overcome gain ... loss ... fame ...
disgrace ... honor ... dishonor ... corrupt wishes ... bad friendship."
That's how you should train.'

Honorable Uttara, this exposition of the teaching is not established
anywhere in the four assemblies---monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.
Sir, learn this exposition of the teaching! Memorize this exposition of
the teaching! Remember this exposition of the teaching! Sir, this
exposition of the teaching is beneficial and relates to the fundamentals
of the spiritual life."

### AN 8.9 Nanda  *Nandasutta*

"Mendicants, you could rightly call Nanda 'Gentleman', 'strong',
'lovely', and 'lustful'. How could he live the full and pure spiritual
life unless he guards the sense doors, eats in moderation, is dedicated
to wakefulness, and has mindfulness and situational awareness?

This is how Nanda guards the sense doors. If he has to look to the east,
he wholeheartedly concentrates before looking, thinking: 'When I look to
the east, bad, unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure will
not overwhelm me.' In this way he's aware of the situation.

If he has to look to the west ... north ... south ... up ... down ... If
he has to survey the intermediate directions, he wholeheartedly
concentrates before looking, thinking: 'When I survey the intermediate
directions, bad, unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure
will not overwhelm me.' In this way he's aware of the situation. This is
how Nanda guards the sense doors.

This is how Nanda eats in moderation. Nanda reflects rationally on the
food he eats: 'Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but
only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual
practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give
rise to new discomfort, and I will have the means to keep going,
blamelessness, and a comfortable abiding.' This is how Nanda eats in
moderation.

This is how Nanda is committed to wakefulness. Nanda practices walking
and sitting meditation by day, purifying his mind from obstacles. In the
first watch of the night, he continues to practice walking and sitting
meditation. In the middle watch, he lies down in the lion's posture---on
the right side, placing one foot on top of the other---mindful and
aware, and focused on the time of getting up. In the last watch, he gets
up and continues to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying
his mind from obstacles. This is how Nanda is committed to wakefulness.

This is how Nanda has mindfulness and situational awareness. Nanda knows
feelings as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. He knows
perceptions as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. He knows
thoughts as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. This is how
Nanda has mindfulness and situational awareness.

How could Nanda live the full and pure spiritual life unless he guards
the sense doors, eats in moderation, is dedicated to wakefulness, and
has mindfulness and situational awareness?"

### AN 8.10 Trash  *Kāraṇḍavasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks
of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. Now at that time the mendicants
accused a mendicant of an offense. The accused mendicant dodged the
issue, distracted the discussion with irrelevant points, and displayed
annoyance, hate, and bitterness.

Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, "Mendicants, throw this person
out! Throw this person out! This person should be shown the door. Why
should you be vexed by an outsider?

Take a case where a certain person looks just the same as other
good-natured mendicants when going out and coming back, when looking
ahead and aside, when bending and extending the limbs, and when bearing
the outer robe, bowl and robes. That is, so long as the mendicants don't
notice his offense. But when the mendicants notice the offense, they
know that he's a corrupt ascetic, just useless trash. When they realize
this they send him away. Why is that? So that he doesn't corrupt
good-natured mendicants.

Suppose in a growing field of barley some bad barley appeared, just
useless trash. Its roots, stem, and leaves would look just the same as
the healthy barley. That is, so long as the head doesn't appear. But
when the head appears, they know that it's bad barley, just useless
trash. When they realize this they pull it up by the roots and throw it
outside the field. Why is that? So that it doesn't spoil the good
barley.

In the same way, take a case where a certain person looks just the same
as other good-natured mendicants when going out and coming back, when
looking ahead and aside, when bending and extending the limbs, and when
bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes. That is, so long as the
mendicants don't notice his offense. But when the mendicants notice the
offense, they know that he's a corrupt ascetic, just useless trash. When
they realize this they send him away. Why is that? So that he doesn't
corrupt good-natured mendicants.

Suppose that a large heap of grain is being winnowed. The grains that
are firm and solid form a heap on one side. And the grains that are
flimsy and insubstantial are blown over to the other side. The owners
take a broom and sweep them even further away. Why is that? So that it
doesn't spoil the good grain. In the same way, take a case where a
certain person looks just the same as other good-natured mendicants when
going out and coming back, when looking ahead and aside, when bending
and extending the limbs, and when bearing the outer robe, bowl and
robes. That is, so long as the mendicants don't notice his offense. But
when the mendicants notice the offense, they know that he's a corrupt
ascetic, just useless trash. When they realize this they send him away.
Why is that? So that he doesn't corrupt good-natured mendicants.

Suppose a man needs an irrigation gutter for a well. He'd take a sharp
axe and enter the wood, where he'd knock various trees with the axe. The
trees that were firm and solid made a cracking sound. But the trees that
were rotten inside, decomposing and decayed, made a thud. He'd cut down
such a tree at the root, lop off the crown, and thoroughly clear out the
insides. Then he'd use it as an irrigation gutter for the well. In the
same way, take a case where a certain person looks just the same as
other good-natured mendicants when going out and coming back, when
looking ahead and aside, when bending and extending the limbs, and when
bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes. That is, so long as the
mendicants don't notice his offense. But when the mendicants notice the
offense, they know that he's a corrupt ascetic, just useless trash. When
they realize this they send him away. Why is that? So that he doesn't
corrupt good-natured mendicants.

> By living together, know that\
> they're irritable, with corrupt wishes,\
> offensive, stubborn, and contemptuous,\
> jealous, stingy, and devious.
>
> They speak to people with a voice\
> so smooth, just like an ascetic.\
> But they act in secret, with their bad views\
> and their lack of regard for others.
>
> You should recognize them for what they are:\
> a creep and liar.\
> Then having gathered in harmony,\
> you should expel them.
>
> Throw out the trash!\
> Get rid of the rubbish!\
> And sweep away the scraps---\
> they're not ascetics, they just think they are.
>
> When you've thrown out those of corrupt wishes,\
> of bad behavior and alms-resort,\
> dwell in communion, ever mindful,\
> the pure with the pure.\
> Then in harmony, alert,\
> make an end of suffering."
