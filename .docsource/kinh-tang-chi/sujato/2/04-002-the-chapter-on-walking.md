# The Chapter on Walking


### N 4.11 Walking *Carasutta*

"Mendicants, suppose a mendicant has a sensual, malicious, or cruel
thought while walking. They tolerate it and don't give it up, get rid of
it, eliminate it, and obliterate it. Such a mendicant is said to be 'not
keen or prudent, always lazy, and lacking energy' when walking.

Suppose a mendicant has a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought while
standing ... sitting ... or when lying down while awake. They tolerate
it and don't give it up, get rid of it, eliminate it, and obliterate it.

>
> you're on the wrong path,\
> lost among things that delude.\
> Such a mendicant is incapable\

> But one who, whether standing or walking,\

> loving peace of mind;\
> such a mendicant is capable\
> of experiencing the highest awakening."

### N 4.12 Ethics *Sīlasutta*

"Mendicants, live by the ethical precepts and the monastic code. Live
restrained in the monastic code, conducting yourselves well and
resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest
fault, keep the rules you've undertaken. When you've done this, what
more is there to do?

Suppose a mendicant has got rid of desire and ill will while walking,
and has given up dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and
doubt. Their energy is roused up and unflagging, their mindfulness is
established and lucid, their body is tranquil and undisturbed, and their
mind is immersed in samādhi. Such a mendicant is said to be
'keen and prudent, always energetic and determined' when walking.

> Carefully walking, carefully standing,\
> carefully sitting, carefully lying;\
> a mendicant carefully bends their limbs,\
> and carefully extends them.
>
> Above, below, all round,\
> as far as the earth extends;\
> they scrutinize the rise and fall\
> of phenomena such as the aggregates.
>
> Training in what leads to serenity of heart,\
> always staying mindful;\
> they call such a mendicant\
> 'always determined'."

### N 4.13 Effort *Padhānasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these four right efforts. What four?

A mendicant generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the
mind, and strives so that bad, unskillful qualities don't arise.

They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and
strive so that bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up.

They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and
strive so that skillful qualities arise.

They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and
strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost,
but increase, mature, and are fulfilled by development.

These are the four right efforts.

> By rightly striving,\
> \>they've crushed Māra's sovereignty;\
> unattached, they've gone beyond\
> \>the peril of birth and death.\
> Contented and unstirred,\
> \>they've vanquished Māra and his mount;\
> now they've gone beyond all Namuci's forces,\
> \>they're happy."

### N 4.14 Restraint *Saṁvarasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these four efforts. What four? The efforts to
restrain, to give up, to develop, and to preserve.

And what, mendicants, is the effort to restrain? When a mendicant sees a
sight with their eyes, they don't get caught up in the features and
details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful
qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For
this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight,
and achieving its restraint. When they hear a sound with their ears ...
When they smell an odor with their nose ... When they taste a flavor
with their tongue ... When they feel a touch with their body ... When
they know an idea with their mind, they don't get caught up in the
features and details. If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad
unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become
overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the
faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint. This is called the effort
to restrain.

And what, mendicants, is the effort to give up? It's when a mendicant
doesn't tolerate a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought that's arisen,
but gives it up, gets rid of it, eliminates it, and obliterates it. They
don't tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give
them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them. This is
called the effort to give up.

And what, mendicants, is the effort to develop? It's when a mendicant
develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of
principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity,
which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as
letting go. This is called the effort to develop.

And what, mendicants, is the effort to preserve? It's when a mendicant
preserves a meditation subject that's a fine basis of immersion: the
perception of a skeleton, a worm-infested corpse, a livid corpse, a
split open corpse, or a bloated corpse. This is called the effort to
preserve.

These are the four efforts.

> Restraint and giving up,\
> development and preservation:\
> these are the four efforts\
> taught by the kinsman of the Sun.\
> Any mendicant who keenly applies these\
> may attain the ending of suffering."

### N 4.15 Regarded as Foremost *Paññattisutta*

"Mendicants, these four are regarded as foremost. What four? The
foremost in size of incarnation is Rāhu, lord of titans.
The foremost pleasure seeker is King Mandhātā. The foremost
in sovereignty is Māra the Wicked. In this world---with its
gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its
ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans---a Realized One, the perfected
one, the fully awakened Buddha is said to be the best. These are the
four regarded as foremost.

> Rāhu is foremost in size of incarnation,\
> Mandhātā in enjoying sensual pleasures,\
> Māra in sovereignty,\
> shining with power and glory.
>
> Above, below, all round,\
> as far as the earth extends;\
> in all the world with its gods,\
> the Buddha is declared foremost."

### N 4.16 Subtlety *Sokhummasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these four kinds of subtlety. What four?

A mendicant has ultimate subtlety of form. They don't see any other
subtlety of form that's better or finer than that, nor do they aim for
it.

A mendicant has ultimate subtlety of feeling. They don't see any other
subtlety of feeling that's better or finer than that, nor do they aim
for it.

A mendicant has ultimate subtlety of perception. They don't see any
other subtlety of perception that's better or finer than that, nor do
they aim for it.

A mendicant has ultimate subtlety of choices. They don't see any other
subtlety of choices that's better or finer than that, nor do they aim
for it.

These are the four kinds of subtlety.

> Knowing the subtlety of form,\
> the cause of feelings,\
> where perception comes from,\
> and where it ends;\
> and knowing choices as other,\
> as suffering and as not-self,
>
> that mendicant sees rightly,\
> peaceful, in love with the state of peace.\
> They bear their final body,\
> having vanquished Māra and his mount."
