# The Chapter on Overflowing Merit


### N 4.51 Overflowing Merit *Paṭhamapuññābhisandasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, there are these four kinds of overflowing merit,
overflowing goodness. They nurture happiness and are conducive to
heaven, ripening in happiness and leading to heaven. They lead to what
is likable, desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness. What four?

When a mendicant enters and remains in a limitless immersion of heart
while using a robe, the overflowing of merit for the donor is limitless
...

When a mendicant enters and remains in a limitless immersion of heart
while eating almsfood, the overflowing of merit for the donor is
limitless ...

When a mendicant enters and remains in a limitless immersion of heart
while using lodgings, the overflowing of merit for the donor is
limitless ...

When a mendicant enters and remains in a limitless immersion of heart
while using medicines and supplies for the sick, the overflowing of
merit for the donor is limitless ...

These are the four kinds of overflowing merit, overflowing goodness.
They nurture happiness and are conducive to heaven, ripening in
happiness and leading to heaven. They lead to what is likable,
desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness.

When a noble disciple has these four kinds of overflowing merit and
goodness, it's not easy to grasp how much merit they have by saying that
this is the extent of their overflowing merit ... that leads to
happiness. It's simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great
mass of merit.

It's like trying to grasp how much water is in the ocean. It's not easy
to say how many gallons, how many hundreds, thousands, hundreds of
thousands of gallons there are. It's simply reckoned as an incalculable,
immeasurable, great mass of water.

In the same way, when a noble disciple has these four kinds of
overflowing merit it's simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable,
great mass of merit.

> Hosts of people use the rivers,\
> and though the rivers are many,\
> all reach the great deep, the boundless ocean,\
> the cruel sea that's home to precious gems.
>
> In the same way, when a person gives\
> \>food, drink, and clothes;\
> and they're a giver of beds, seats, and mats---\
> the streams of merit reach that astute person,\
> as the rivers bring their waters to the sea."

### N 4.52 Overflowing Merit (2nd) *Dutiyapuññābhisandasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these four kinds of overflowing merit,
overflowing goodness. They nurture happiness and are conducive to
heaven, ripening in happiness and leading to heaven. They lead to what
is likable, desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness. What four?

It's when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha:
'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in
knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for
those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.'
This is the first kind of overflowing merit ...

Furthermore, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the
teaching: 'The teaching is well explained by the Buddha---apparent in
the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant,
so that sensible people can know it for themselves.' This is the second
kind of overflowing merit ...

Furthermore, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the
Saṅgha: 'The Saṅgha of the Buddha's disciples
is practicing the way that's good, sincere, systematic, and proper. It
consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the
Saṅgha of the Buddha's disciples that is worthy of
offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a
religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the
supreme field of merit for the world.' This is the third kind of
overflowing merit ...

Furthermore, a noble disciple's ethical conduct is loved by the noble
ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised
by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. This is the
fourth kind of overflowing merit ...

These are the four kinds of overflowing merit, overflowing goodness.
They nurture happiness and are conducive to heaven, ripening in
happiness and leading to heaven. They lead to what is likable,
desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness.

> Whoever has faith in the Realized One,\
> unwavering and well grounded;\
> whose ethical conduct is good,\
> praised and loved by the noble ones;
>
> who has confidence in the Saṅgha,\
> and correct view:\
> they're said to be prosperous,\
> their life is not in vain.
>
> So let the wise devote themselves\
> to faith, ethical behavior,\
> confidence, and insight into the teaching,\
> remembering the instructions of the Buddhas."

### N 4.53 Living Together (1st) *Paṭhamasaṁvāsasutta*

At one time the Buddha was traveling along the road between
Madhurā and Verañjā, as were several
householders, both women and men. The Buddha left the road and sat at
the root of a tree, where the householders saw him.

They went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha
said to them:

"Householders, there are four ways of living together. What four?

1.  A male zombie living with a female zombie;

2.  a male zombie living with a goddess;

3.  a god living with a female zombie;

4.  a god living with a goddess.

And how does a male zombie live with a female zombie? It's when the
husband kills living creatures, steals, commits sexual misconduct, lies,
and consumes beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants. He's unethical, of bad
character, living at home with his heart full of the stain of
stinginess, abusing and insulting ascetics and brahmins. And the wife is
also ... unethical, of bad character ... That's how a male zombie lives
with a female zombie.

And how does a male zombie live with a goddess? It's when the husband
... is unethical, of bad character ... But the wife doesn't kill living
creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or consume beer, wine,
and liquor intoxicants. She's ethical, of good character, living at home
with her heart rid of the stain of stinginess, not abusing and insulting
ascetics and brahmins. That's how a male zombie lives with a goddess.

And how does a god live with a female zombie? It's when the husband ...
is ethical, of good character ... But the wife ... is unethical, of bad
character ... That's how a god lives with a female zombie.

And how does a god live with a goddess? It's when the husband ... is
ethical, of good character ... And the wife is also ... ethical, of good
character ... That's how a god lives with a goddess.

These are the four ways of living together.

> When both are unethical,\
> miserly and abusive,\
> then wife and husband\
> live together as zombies.
>
> When the husband is unethical,\
> miserly and abusive,\
> but the wife is ethical,\
> bountiful, rid of stinginess,\
> she's a goddess living\
> with a zombie for a husband.
>
> When the husband is ethical,\
> bountiful, rid of stinginess,\
> but the wife is unethical,\
> miserly and abusive,\
> she's a zombie living\
> with a god for a husband.
>
> When both are faithful and bountiful,\
> disciplined, living righteously,\
> then wife and husband\
> say nice things to each other.
>
> They get all the things they need,\
> so they live at ease.\
> Their enemies are downhearted,\
> when both are equal in ethics.
>
> Having practiced the teaching here,\
> both equal in precepts and observances,\
> they delight in the heavenly realm,\
> enjoying all the pleasures they desire."

### N 4.54 Living Together (2nd) *Dutiyasaṁvāsasutta*

"Mendicants, there are four ways of living together. What four?

1.  A male zombie living with a female zombie;

2.  a male zombie living with a goddess;

3.  a god living with a female zombie;

4.  a god living with a goddess.

And how does a male zombie live with a female zombie? It's when the
husband kills living creatures, steals, commits sexual misconduct; he
uses speech that's false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and he's
covetous, malicious, and has wrong view. He's unethical, of bad
character, living at home with his heart full of the stain of
stinginess, abusing and insulting ascetics and brahmins. And the wife is
also ... unethical, of bad character ... That's how a male zombie lives
with a female zombie.

And how does a male zombie live with a goddess? It's when the husband
... is unethical, of bad character ... But the wife doesn't kill living
creatures, steal, or commit sexual misconduct. She doesn't use speech
that's false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And she's contented,
kind-hearted, with right view. She's ethical, of good character, living
at home with her heart rid of the stain of stinginess, not abusing and
insulting ascetics and brahmins. That's how a male zombie lives with a
goddess.

And how does a god live with a female zombie? It's when the husband ...
is ethical, of good character ... But the wife ... is unethical, of bad
character ... That's how a god lives with a female zombie.

And how does a god live with a goddess? It's when the husband ... is
ethical, of good character ... And the wife is also ... ethical, of good
character ... That's how a god lives with a goddess.

These are the four ways of living together." ...

### N 4.55 Equality (1st) *Paṭhamasamajīvīsutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in the
land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at
Bhesakaḷā's Wood.

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
went to the home of the householder Nakula's father, where he sat on the
seat spread out.

Then the householder Nakula's father and the housewife Nakula's mother
went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Nakula's father
said to the Buddha, "Sir, ever since we were both young, and Nakula's
mother was given to me in marriage, I can't recall betraying her even in
thought, still less in deed. We want to see each other in both this life
and the next."

Then Nakula's mother said to the Buddha, "Sir, ever since we were both
young, and I was given in marriage to Nakula's father, I can't recall
betraying him even in thought, still less in deed. We want to see each
other in both this life and the next."

"Householders, if wife and husband want to see each other in both this
life and the next, they should be equals in faith, ethics, generosity,
and wisdom.

> When both are faithful and bountiful,\
> disciplined, living righteously,\
> then wife and husband\
> say nice things to each other.
>
> They get all the things they need,\
> so they live at ease.\
> Their enemies are downhearted,\
> when both are equal in ethics.
>
> Having practiced the teaching here,\
> both equal in precepts and observances,\
> they delight in the heavenly realm,\
> enjoying all the pleasures they desire."

### N 4.57 Suppavāsā *Suppavāsāsutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Koliyans, where
they have a town named Pajjanika.

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
went to the home of Suppavāsā the Koliyan, where he sat on
the seat spread out. Then Suppavāsā served and satisfied
the Buddha with her own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.
When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, she sat down to
one side. The Buddha said to her:

"Suppavāsā, when a noble disciple gives food, she gives the
recipients four things. What four? Long life, beauty, happiness, and
strength. Giving long life, she has long life as a god or human. Giving
beauty, she has beauty as a god or human. Giving happiness, she has
happiness as a god or human. Giving strength, she has strength as a god
or human. When a noble disciple gives food, she gives the recipients
these four things.

> When she gives well-prepared food,\
> pure, fine, and full of flavor,\
> that offering---given to the sincere,\
> who have good conduct, and are big-hearted---\
> joins merit to merit. It's very fruitful,\
> and is praised by those who know the world.
>
> Those who recall such sacrifices,\
> live in the world full of inspiration.\
> They've driven out the stain of stinginess,\
> \>root and all,\
> blameless, they go to a heavenly place."

### N 4.58 Sudatta *Sudattasutta*

Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha,
bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:

"Householder, when a noble disciple gives food, they give the recipients
four things. What four? Long life, beauty, happiness, and strength.
Giving long life, they have long life as a god or human. ... Giving
beauty ... happiness ... strength ... When a noble disciple gives food,
they give the recipients these four things.

> Carefully giving food at the right time,\
> to those who are disciplined,\
> \>eating only what others give,\
> you provide them with four things:\
> long life, beauty, happiness, and strength.
>
> A person who gives long life, beauty,\
> happiness, and strength,\
> has long life and fame\
> wherever they're reborn."

### N 4.60 Lay Practice *Gihisāmīcisutta*

Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha,
bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:

"Householder, when a noble disciple does four things they are practicing
appropriately for a layperson, which brings fame and leads to heaven.
What four? It's when a noble disciple serves the mendicant
Saṅgha with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and
supplies for the sick. When a noble disciple does these four things they
are practicing appropriately for a layperson, which brings fame and
leads to heaven.

> Those who are astute practice the way\
> that's appropriate for laypeople.\
> They provide those who are ethical\
> and rightly comported with robes,
>
> almsfood, lodgings,\
> and supplies for the sick.\
> Their merit always grows\
> by day and by night.\
> They pass on to a place in heaven,\
> having done excellent deeds."
