## The Chapter at Wares Village  {#the-chapter-at-wares-village .unnumbered}

### N 4.1 Understood  *Anubuddhasutta* {#n-4.1-understood-anubuddhasutta .unnumbered}

[So I have heard.]{.smallcaps} At one time the Buddha was staying in the
land of the Vajjis at Wares Village. There the Buddha addressed the
mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, due to not understanding and not penetrating four things,
both you and I have wandered and transmigrated for such a very long
time. What four? Noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom. These
noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom have been understood and
comprehended. Craving for continued existence has been cut off; the
conduit to rebirth is ended; now there'll be no more future lives."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "Ethics, immersion, and wisdom,\
> and the supreme freedom:\
> these things have been understood\
> by Gotama the renowned.
>
> And so the Buddha, having insight,\
> explained this teaching to the mendicants.\
> The teacher made an end of suffering,\
> seeing clearly, he is fully quenched."

### N 4.2 Fallen  *Papatitasutta* {#n-4.2-fallen-papatitasutta .unnumbered}

"Someone without four things is said to have 'fallen from this teaching
and training'. What four? Noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom.
Someone without these four things is said to have 'fallen from this
teaching and training'.

Someone with four things is said to be 'secure in this teaching and
training'. What four? Noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom.
Someone with these four things is said to be 'secure in this teaching
and training'.

> They fall, collapsed and fallen;\
> greedy, they return.\
> The work is done, the joyful is enjoyed,\
> happiness is found through happiness."

### N 4.3 Broken (1st)  *Paṭhamakhatasutta* {#n-4.3-broken-1st-paṭhamakhatasutta .unnumbered}

"When a foolish, incompetent untrue person has four qualities they keep
themselves broken and damaged. They deserve to be blamed and criticized
by sensible people, and they create much wickedness. What four? Without
examining or scrutinizing, they praise those deserving of criticism, and
they criticize those deserving of praise. They arouse faith in things
that are dubious, and they don't arouse faith in things that are
inspiring. When a foolish, incompetent untrue person has these four
qualities they keep themselves broken and damaged. They deserve to be
blamed and criticized by sensible people, and they create much
wickedness.

When an astute, competent true person has four qualities they keep
themselves intact and unscathed. They don't deserve to be blamed and
criticized by sensible people, and they create much merit. What four?
After examining and scrutinizing, they criticize those deserving of
criticism, and they praise those deserving of praise. They don't arouse
faith in things that are dubious, and they do arouse faith in things
that are inspiring. When an astute, competent true person has these four
qualities they keep themselves intact and unscathed. They don't deserve
to be blamed and criticized by sensible people, and they create much
merit.

> When you praise someone worthy of criticism,\
> or criticize someone worthy of praise,\
> you choose bad luck with your own mouth:\
> you'll never find happiness that way.
>
> Bad luck at dice is a trivial thing,\
> if all you lose is your money\
> and all you own, even yourself.\
> What's really terrible luck\
> is to hate the holy ones.
>
> For more than two quinquadecillion years,\
> and another five quattuordecillion years,\
> a slanderer of noble ones goes to hell,\
> having aimed bad words and thoughts at them."

### N 4.4 Broken (2nd)  *Dutiyakhatasutta* {#n-4.4-broken-2nd-dutiyakhatasutta .unnumbered}

"When a foolish, incompetent untrue person acts wrongly toward four
people they keep themselves broken and damaged. They deserve to be
blamed and criticized by sensible people, and they create much
wickedness. What four? Mother ... father ... a Realized One ... and a
disciple of a Realized One. When a foolish, incompetent untrue person
acts wrongly toward these four people they keep themselves broken and
damaged. They deserve to be blamed and criticized by sensible people,
and they create much wickedness.

When an astute, competent true person acts rightly toward four people
they keep themselves intact and unscathed. They don't deserve to be
blamed and criticized by sensible people, and they create much merit.
What four? Mother ... father ... a Realized One ... and a disciple of a
Realized One. When an astute, competent true person acts rightly toward
these four people they keep themselves intact and unscathed. They don't
deserve to be blamed and criticized by sensible people, and they create
much merit.

> A person who does wrong\
> by their mother or father,\
> or a Realized One, a Buddha,\
> or one of their disciples,\
> creates much wickedness.
>
> Because of their unprincipled conduct\
> toward their parents,\
> they're criticized in this life by the astute,\
> and they depart to be reborn in a place of loss.
>
> A person who does right\

### N 4.5 With the Stream  *Anusotasutta* {#n-4.5-with-the-stream-anusotasutta .unnumbered}

"These four people are found in the world. What four? A person who goes
with the stream; a person who goes against the stream; a steadfast
person; and a brahmin who has crossed over and stands on the far shore.

And who is the person who goes with the stream? It's a person who takes
part in sensual pleasures and does bad deeds. This is called a person
who goes with the stream.

And who is the person who goes against the stream? It's a person who
doesn't take part in sensual pleasures or do bad deeds. They live the
full and pure spiritual life in pain and sadness, weeping, with tearful
faces. This is called a person who goes against the stream.

And who is the steadfast person? It's a person who, with the ending of
the five lower fetters, is reborn spontaneously. They're extinguished
there, and are not liable to return from that world. This is called a
steadfast person.

And who is a brahmin who has crossed over and stands on the far shore?
It's a person who realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by
wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their
own insight due to the ending of defilements. This is called a brahmin
who has crossed over and stands on the far shore.

These are the four people found in the world.

> All those people with unbridled sensuality,\
> not free of lust, enjoying sensual pleasures in this life:\
> again and again, they return to birth and old age;\
> those who go with the stream are sunk in craving.
>
> So the attentive in this life,\
> \>with mindfulness established,\
> don't take part in sensual pleasures and bad deeds.\
> In pain they'd give up sensual pleasures:\
> they call that person\
> \>'one who goes against the stream'.
>
> Someone who's given up five corruptions,\
> a perfect trainee, not liable to decline,\
> who's mastered their mind,\
> \>with faculties immersed in [samādhi]{lang="sa"},\
> that's called 'a steadfast person'.
>
> The sage who has comprehended all things,\
> \>high and low,\
> cleared them and ended them, so they are no more;\
> they've completed the spiritual journey,\
> \>and gone to the end of the world,\
> they're called 'one who has gone beyond'."

### N 4.6 A Little Learning  *Appassutasutta* {#n-4.6-a-little-learning-appassutasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, these four people are found in the world. What four? A
person may have:

1.  Little learning and not get the point of learning.

2.  Little learning but get the point of learning.

3.  Much learning but not get the point of learning.

4.  Much learning and get the point of learning.

And how has a person learned little and not got the point of learning?
It's when a person has learned little of the statements, mixed prose &
verse, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of
past lives, amazing stories, and elaborations. And with the little
they've learned, they understand neither the meaning nor the teaching,
nor do they practice in line with the teaching. That's how a person has
learned little and not got the point of learning.

And how has a person learned little but has got the point of learning?
It's when a person has learned little of the statements, mixed prose &
verse, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of
past lives, amazing stories, and elaborations. But with the little
they've learned, they understand the meaning and the teaching, and they
practice in line with the teaching. That's how a person has learned
little but has got the point of learning.

And how has a person learned much but hasn't got the point of learning?
It's when a person has learned much of the statements, mixed prose &
verse, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of
past lives, amazing stories, and elaborations. But even though they've
learned much, they understand neither the meaning nor the teaching, nor
do they practice in line with the teaching. That's how a person has
learned much but hasn't got the point of learning.

And how has a person learned much and has got the point of learning?
It's when a person has learned much of the statements, mixed prose &
verse, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of
past lives, amazing stories, and elaborations. And with the large amount
they've learned, they understand the meaning and the teaching, and they
practice in line with the teaching. That's how a person has learned much
and has got the point of learning.

These are the four people found in the world.

> If you don't learn much,\
> and aren't steady in ethics,\
> they'll criticize you on both counts,\
> for your ethics and your learning.
>
> If you don't learn much,\
> and you are steady in ethics,\
> they'll praise your ethical conduct,\
> since your learning has succeeded.
>
> If you learn much,\
> but aren't steady in ethics,\
> they'll criticize your ethical conduct,\
> for your learning hasn't succeeded.
>
> If you learn much,\
> and you are steady in ethics,\
> they'll praise you on both counts,\
> for your ethics and your learning.
>
> A wise disciple of the Buddha\
> who is learned and has memorized the teachings;\
> like a pendant of Black Plum River gold,\
> who is worthy to criticize them?\
> Even the gods praise them,\
> and by the Divinity, too, they're praised."

### N 4.7 Beautification  *Sobhanasutta* {#n-4.7-beautification-sobhanasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, these four who are competent, educated, assured, and
learned, who have memorized the teachings and practice in line with the
teachings, beautify the [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"}. What four? A monk, a nun, a
layman, and a laywoman.

These four who are competent, educated, assured, and learned, who have
memorized the teachings and practice in line with the teachings,
beautify the [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"}.

> Whoever is competent and assured,\
> learned, a memorizer of the teachings,\
> who lives in line with the teachings---\
> such a person is said to beautify the [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"}.
>
> A monk accomplished in ethics,\
> and a learned nun,\
> a faithful layman,\
> and a faithful laywoman, too:\
> these beautify the [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"},\
> they are the beautifiers of the [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"}."

### N 4.8 Self-assured  *Vesārajjasutta* {#n-4.8-self-assured-vesārajjasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, a Realized One has four kinds of self-assurance. With these
he claims the bull's place, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and
turns the divine wheel. What four?

I see no reason for anyone---whether ascetic, brahmin, god,
[Māra]{lang="sa"}, or the Divinity, or anyone else in the world---to
legitimately scold me, saying: 'You claim to be a fully awakened Buddha,
but you don't understand these things.' Since I see no such reason, I
live secure, fearless, and assured.

I see no reason for anyone---whether ascetic, brahmin, god,
[Māra]{lang="sa"}, or the Divinity, or anyone else in the world---to
legitimately scold me, saying: 'You claim to have ended all defilements,
but you still have these defilements.' Since I see no such reason, I
live secure, fearless, and assured.

I see no reason for anyone---whether ascetic, brahmin, god,
[Māra]{lang="sa"}, or the Divinity, or anyone else in the world---to
legitimately scold me, saying: 'The acts that you say are obstructions
are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.' Since I see
no such reason, I live secure, fearless, and assured.

I see no reason for anyone---whether ascetic, brahmin, god,
[Māra]{lang="sa"}, or the Divinity, or anyone else in the world---to
legitimately scold me, saying: 'Though you teach that this teaching
leads to the goal of the complete ending of suffering, it doesn't lead
there for one who practices it.' Since I see no such reason, I live
secure, fearless, and assured.

A Realized One has these four kinds of self-assurance. With these he
claims the bull's place, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and
turns the divine wheel.

> The various grounds for criticism\
> that ascetics and brahmins rely on\
> vanish on reaching a Realized One,\
> assured, gone beyond grounds for criticism.
>
> He rolls forth the Wheel of Dhamma\
> \>as a consummate one,\
> complete, sympathetic for all living creatures.\
> Sentient beings revere him,\
> \>first among gods and humans,\
> who has gone beyond rebirth."

### N 4.9 The Arising of Craving  *Taṇhuppādasutta* {#n-4.9-the-arising-of-craving-taṇhuppādasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, there are four things that give rise to craving in a
mendicant. What four? For the sake of robes, almsfood, lodgings, or
rebirth in this or that state.

These are the four things that give rise to craving in a mendicant.

> Craving is a person's partner\
> as they transmigrate on this long journey.\
> They go from this state to another,\
> but don't escape transmigration.
>
> Knowing this drawback---\
> that craving is the cause of suffering---\
> rid of craving, free of grasping,\
> a mendicant would wander mindful."

### N 4.10 Yokes  *Yogasutta* {#n-4.10-yokes-yogasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, there are these four yokes. What four? The yokes of sensual
pleasures, future lives, views, and ignorance.

And what is the yoke of sensual pleasures? It's when you don't truly
understand sensual pleasures' origin, ending, gratification, drawback,
and escape. So greed, relishing, affection, infatuation, thirst,
passion, attachment, and craving for sensual pleasures linger on inside.
This is called the yoke of sensual pleasures. Such is the yoke of
sensual pleasures.

And what is the yoke of future lives? It's when you don't truly
understand future lives' origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and
escape. So greed, relishing, affection, infatuation, thirst, passion,
attachment, and craving for continued existence linger on inside. This
is called the yoke of future lives. Such are the yokes of sensual
pleasures and future lives.

And what is the yoke of views? It's when you don't truly understand
views' origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape. So greed,
relishing, affection, infatuation, thirst, passion, attachment, and
craving for views linger on inside. This is called the yoke of views.
Such are the yokes of sensual pleasures, future lives, and views.

And what is the yoke of ignorance? It's when you don't truly understand
the six fields of contact's origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and
escape, so ignorance and unknowing of the six fields of contact linger
on inside. This is called the yoke of ignorance. Such are the yokes of
sensual pleasures, future lives, views, and ignorance. These are bad,
unskillful qualities that are corrupting, leading to future lives,
hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.
That's why someone yoked to them is called: 'one who has not found
sanctuary from the yoke'.

These are the four yokes.

There are these four kinds of unyoking. What four? Unyoking from sensual
pleasures, future lives, views, and ignorance.

And what is unyoking from sensual pleasures? It's when you truly
understand sensual pleasures' origin, ending, gratification, drawback,
and escape. So greed, relishing, affection, infatuation, thirst,
passion, attachment, and craving for sensual pleasures don't linger on
inside. This is called unyoking from sensual pleasures. Such is unyoking
from sensual pleasures.

And what is unyoking from future lives? It's when you truly understand
future lives' origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape. So
greed, relishing, affection, infatuation, thirst, passion, attachment,
and craving for continued existence don't linger on inside. This is
called unyoking from future lives. Such is unyoking from sensual
pleasures and future lives.

And what is unyoking from views? It's when you truly understand views'
origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape. So greed,
relishing, affection, infatuation, thirst, passion, attachment, and
craving for views don't linger on inside. This is called unyoking from
views. Such is unyoking from sensual pleasures, future lives, and views.

And what is unyoking from ignorance? It's when you truly understand the
six fields of contact's origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and
escape, so ignorance and unknowing of the six fields of contact don't
linger on inside. This is called unyoking from ignorance. Such is
unyoking from sensual pleasures, future lives, views, and ignorance.
These are bad, unskillful qualities that are corrupting, leading to
future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old
age, and death. That's why someone unyoked from them is called: 'one who
has found sanctuary from the yoke'.

These are the four kinds of unyoking.

> Yoked to both sensual pleasures\
> and the desire to be reborn in a future life;\
> yoked also to views,\
> and governed by ignorance,
>
> sentient beings continue to transmigrate,\
> with ongoing birth and death.\
> But those who fully understand sensual pleasures,\
> and the yoke to all future lives;
>
> with the yoke of views eradicated,\
> and ignorance dispelled,\
> unyoked from all yokes,\
> truly those sages have slipped their yoke."

## The Chapter on Walking  {#the-chapter-on-walking .unnumbered}

### N 4.11 Walking  *Carasutta* {#n-4.11-walking-carasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, suppose a mendicant has a sensual, malicious, or cruel
thought while walking. They tolerate it and don't give it up, get rid of
it, eliminate it, and obliterate it. Such a mendicant is said to be 'not
keen or prudent, always lazy, and lacking energy' when walking.

Suppose a mendicant has a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought while
standing ... sitting ... or when lying down while awake. They tolerate
it and don't give it up, get rid of it, eliminate it, and obliterate it.
Such a mendicant is said to be 'not keen or prudent, always lazy, and

and determined' when lying down while awake."

> Whether walking or standing,\
> sitting or lying down,\
> if you think a bad thought\
> to do with the domestic life,
>
> you're on the wrong path,\
> lost among things that delude.\
> Such a mendicant is incapable\

>
> But one who, whether standing or walking,\
> sitting or lying down,\
> has calmed their thoughts,\
> loving peace of mind;\
> such a mendicant is capable\
> of experiencing the highest awakening."

### N 4.12 Ethics  *Sīlasutta* {#n-4.12-ethics-sīlasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, live by the ethical precepts and the monastic code. Live
restrained in the monastic code, conducting yourselves well and
resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest
fault, keep the rules you've undertaken. When you've done this, what
more is there to do?

Suppose a mendicant has got rid of desire and ill will while walking,
and has given up dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and
doubt. Their energy is roused up and unflagging, their mindfulness is
established and lucid, their body is tranquil and undisturbed, and their
mind is immersed in [samādhi]{lang="sa"}. Such a mendicant is said to be
'keen and prudent, always energetic and determined' when walking.

dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. Their
energy is roused up and unflagging, their mindfulness is established and
lucid, their body is tranquil and undisturbed, and their mind is
immersed in [samādhi]{lang="sa"}. Such a mendicant is said to be 'keen

awake.

> Carefully walking, carefully standing,\
> carefully sitting, carefully lying;\
> a mendicant carefully bends their limbs,\
> and carefully extends them.
>
> Above, below, all round,\
> as far as the earth extends;\
> they scrutinize the rise and fall\
> of phenomena such as the aggregates.
>
> Training in what leads to serenity of heart,\
> always staying mindful;\
> they call such a mendicant\
> 'always determined'."

### N 4.13 Effort  *Padhānasutta* {#n-4.13-effort-padhānasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, there are these four right efforts. What four?

A mendicant generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the
mind, and strives so that bad, unskillful qualities don't arise.

They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and
strive so that bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up.

They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and
strive so that skillful qualities arise.

They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and
strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost,
but increase, mature, and are fulfilled by development.

These are the four right efforts.

> By rightly striving,\
> \>they've crushed [Māra]{lang="sa"}'s sovereignty;\
> unattached, they've gone beyond\
> \>the peril of birth and death.\
> Contented and unstirred,\
> \>they've vanquished [Māra]{lang="sa"} and his mount;\
> now they've gone beyond all Namuci's forces,\
> \>they're happy."

### N 4.14 Restraint  *Saṁvarasutta* {#n-4.14-restraint-saṁvarasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, there are these four efforts. What four? The efforts to
restrain, to give up, to develop, and to preserve.

And what, mendicants, is the effort to restrain? When a mendicant sees a
sight with their eyes, they don't get caught up in the features and
details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful
qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For
this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight,
and achieving its restraint. When they hear a sound with their ears ...
When they smell an odor with their nose ... When they taste a flavor
with their tongue ... When they feel a touch with their body ... When
they know an idea with their mind, they don't get caught up in the
features and details. If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad
unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become
overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the
faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint. This is called the effort
to restrain.

And what, mendicants, is the effort to give up? It's when a mendicant
doesn't tolerate a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought that's arisen,
but gives it up, gets rid of it, eliminates it, and obliterates it. They
don't tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give
them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them. This is
called the effort to give up.

And what, mendicants, is the effort to develop? It's when a mendicant
develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of
principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity,
which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as
letting go. This is called the effort to develop.

And what, mendicants, is the effort to preserve? It's when a mendicant
preserves a meditation subject that's a fine basis of immersion: the
perception of a skeleton, a worm-infested corpse, a livid corpse, a
split open corpse, or a bloated corpse. This is called the effort to
preserve.

These are the four efforts.

> Restraint and giving up,\
> development and preservation:\
> these are the four efforts\
> taught by the kinsman of the Sun.\
> Any mendicant who keenly applies these\
> may attain the ending of suffering."

### N 4.15 Regarded as Foremost  *Paññattisutta* {#n-4.15-regarded-as-foremost-paññattisutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, these four are regarded as foremost. What four? The
foremost in size of incarnation is [Rāhu]{lang="sa"}, lord of titans.
The foremost pleasure seeker is King [Mandhātā]{lang="sa"}. The foremost
in sovereignty is [Māra]{lang="sa"} the Wicked. In this world---with its
gods, [Māras]{lang="sa"}, and divinities, this population with its
ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans---a Realized One, the perfected
one, the fully awakened Buddha is said to be the best. These are the
four regarded as foremost.

> [Rāhu]{lang="sa"} is foremost in size of incarnation,\
> [Mandhātā]{lang="sa"} in enjoying sensual pleasures,\
> [Māra]{lang="sa"} in sovereignty,\
> shining with power and glory.
>
> Above, below, all round,\

> in all the world with its gods,\
> the Buddha is declared foremost."

### N 4.16 Subtlety  *Sokhummasutta* {#n-4.16-subtlety-sokhummasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, there are these four kinds of subtlety. What four?

A mendicant has ultimate subtlety of form. They don't see any other
subtlety of form that's better or finer than that, nor do they aim for
it.

A mendicant has ultimate subtlety of feeling. They don't see any other
subtlety of feeling that's better or finer than that, nor do they aim
for it.

A mendicant has ultimate subtlety of perception. They don't see any
other subtlety of perception that's better or finer than that, nor do
they aim for it.

A mendicant has ultimate subtlety of choices. They don't see any other
subtlety of choices that's better or finer than that, nor do they aim
for it.

These are the four kinds of subtlety.

## The Chapter at Uruvelā  {#the-chapter-at-uruvelā .unnumbered}

### N 4.21 At Uruvelā (1st)  *Paṭhamauruvelasutta* {#n-4.21-at-uruvelā-1st-paṭhamauruvelasutta .unnumbered}

[So I have heard.]{.smallcaps} At one time the Buddha was staying near
[Sāvatthī]{lang="sa"} in Jeta's Grove, [Anāthapiṇḍika]{lang="sa"}'s
monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, this one time, when I was first awakened, I was staying in
[Uruvelā]{lang="sa"} at the goatherd's banyan tree on the bank of the
[Nerañjarā]{lang="sa"} River. As I was in private retreat this thought
came to mind: 'One without respect and reverence lives in suffering.
What ascetic or brahmin should I honor and respect and rely on?'

Then it occurred to me: 'I would honor and respect and rely on another
ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of ethics, if
it were incomplete. But I don't see any other ascetic or brahmin in this
world---with its gods, [Māras]{lang="sa"}, and Divinities, this
population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans---who is
more accomplished than myself in ethics, who I should honor and respect
and rely on.

I would honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as
to complete the entire spectrum of immersion, if it were incomplete. But
I don't see any other ascetic or brahmin ... who is more accomplished
than myself in immersion ...

I would honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as
to complete the entrie spectrum of wisdom, if it were incomplete. But I
don't see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world ... who is more
accomplished than myself in wisdom ...

I would honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as
to complete the entire spectrum of freedom, if it were incomplete. But I
don't see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world ... who is more
accomplished than myself in freedom ...'

Then it occurred to me: 'Why don't I honor and respect and rely on the
same teaching to which I was awakened?'

And then the divinity Sahampati, knowing my train of thought, vanished
from the realm of divinity and appeared in front of me, as easily as a
strong man would extend or contract his arm. He arranged his robe over
one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward me, and said: 'That's so
true, Blessed One! That's so true, Holy One! All the perfected ones, the
fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past honored and respected and
relied on this same teaching. All the perfected ones, the fully awakened
Buddhas who will live in the future will honor and respect and rely on
this same teaching. May the Blessed One, who is the perfected one, the
fully awakened Buddha at present, also honor and respect and rely on
this same teaching.'

That's what the divinity Sahampati said. Then he went on to say:

> 'All Buddhas, whether in the past,\
> the Buddhas of the future,\
> and the Buddha at present---\
> destroyer of the sorrows of many---
>
> respecting the true teaching\
> they did live, they do live,\
> and they also will live.\
> This is the nature of the Buddhas.
>
> Therefore someone who cares for their own welfare,\
> and wants to become the very best they can be,\
> should respect the true teaching,\
> remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.'

That's what the divinity Sahampati said. Then he bowed and respectfully
circled me, keeping me on his right side, before vanishing right there.
Then, knowing the request of the Divinity and what was suitable for
myself, I honored and respected and relied on the same teaching to which
I was awakened. And since the [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"} has also achieved
greatness, I also respect the [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"}."

### N 4.22 At Uruvelā (2nd)  *Dutiyauruvelasutta* {#n-4.22-at-uruvelā-2nd-dutiyauruvelasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, this one time, when I was first awakened, I was staying in
[Uruvelā]{lang="sa"} at the goatherd's banyan tree on the bank of the
[Nerañjarā]{lang="sa"} River. Then several old brahmins---elderly and
senior, who were advanced in years and had reached the final stage of
life---came up to me, and exchanged greetings with me.

When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to
one side, and said to me: 'Mister Gotama, we have heard this:

"The ascetic Gotama does not bow to old brahmins, elderly and senior,
who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor
does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat." And this is indeed
the case, for Mister Gotama does not bow to old brahmins, elderly and
senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of
life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat. This is
not appropriate, Mister Gotama.'

Then it occurred to me, 'These venerables don't know what a senior is,
or what qualities make you a senior.'

Mendicants, suppose you're eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old. But
your speech is untimely, false, meaningless, and against the teaching or
training. You say things at the wrong time which are worthless,
unreasonable, rambling, and unbeneficial. Then you'll be considered a
'childish senior'.

Now suppose you're a youth, young, with pristine black hair, blessed
with youth, in the prime of life. But your speech is timely, true,
meaningful, and in line with the teaching and training. You say things
at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and
beneficial. Then you'll be considered an 'astute senior'.

There are these four qualities that make a senior. What four? A
mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting
themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger
in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they've undertaken.

They're very learned, remembering and keeping what they've learned.
These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good
in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice
that's entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings,
remembering them, rehearsing them, mentally scrutinizing them, and
comprehending them theoretically.

They get the four absorptions---blissful meditations in this life that
belong to the higher mind---when they want, without trouble or
difficulty.

They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in
this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight
due to the ending of defilements.

These are the four qualities that make a senior.

> The creature with a restless mind\
> speaks a lot of nonsense.\
> Their thoughts are unsettled,\
> and they don't like the true teaching.\
> They're far from seniority, with their bad views\
> and their lack of regard for others.
>
> But one accomplished in ethics,\
> learned and eloquent, that wise one\
> is restrained when experiencing phenomena,\
> discerning the meaning with wisdom.
>
> Gone beyond all things,\
> kind, eloquent,\
> they've given up birth and death,\
> and have completed the spiritual journey.
>
> That's who I call a senior,\
> who has no defilements.\
> With the ending of defilements, a mendicant\
> is declared a 'senior'."

### N 4.23 The World  *Lokasutta* {#n-4.23-the-world-lokasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, the world has been understood by the Realized One; and he
is detached from the world. The origin of the world has been understood
by the Realized One; and he has given up the origin of the world. The
cessation of the world has been understood by the Realized One; and he
has realized the cessation of the world. The practice that leads to the
cessation of the world has been understood by the Realized One; and he
has developed the practice that leads to the cessation of the world.

In this world---with its gods, [Māras]{lang="sa"}, and Divinities, this
population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and
humans---whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, and
explored by the mind, all that has been understood by the Realized One.
That's why he's called the 'Realized One'.

From the night when the Realized One understands the supreme perfect
awakening until the night he becomes fully extinguished---in the element
of extinguishment with no residue---everything he speaks, says, and
expresses is real, not otherwise. That's why he's called the 'Realized
One'.

The Realized One does as he says, and says as he does. Since this is so,
that's why he's called the 'Realized One'.

In this world---with its gods, [Māras]{lang="sa"}, and divinities, this
population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans---the
Realized One is the vanquisher, the unvanquished, the universal seer,
the wielder of power. That's why he's called the 'Realized One'.

> Directly knowing the whole world as it is,\
> and everything in it,\
> he is detached from the whole world,\
> disengaged from the whole world.
>
> That attentive one is the champion\
> who is released from all ties.\
> He has reached ultimate peace:\
> extinguishment, fearing nothing from any quarter.
>
> He is the Buddha, with defilements ended,\
> untroubled, with doubts cut off.\
> He has attained the end of all deeds,\
> freed with the end of attachments.
>
> That Blessed One is the Buddha,\
> he is the supreme lion,\
> in all the world with its gods,\
> he turns the divine wheel.
>
> And so those gods and humans,\
> who have gone to the Buddha for refuge,\
> come together and revere him,\
> great of heart and intrepid:
>
> 'Tamed, he is the best of tamers,\
> peaceful, he is the seer among the peaceful,\
> liberated, he is the foremost of liberators,\
> crossed over, he is the most excellent of guides across.'
>
> And so they revere him,\
> great of heart and intrepid.\
> In the world with its gods,\
> he has no rival."

### N 4.24 At Kāḷaka's Monastery  *Kāḷakārāmasutta* {#n-4.24-at-kāḷakas-monastery-kāḷakārāmasutta .unnumbered}

At one time the Buddha was staying near [Sāketa]{lang="sa"}, in
[Kāḷaka]{lang="sa"}'s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the
mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"In this world---with its gods, [Māras]{lang="sa"}, and divinities, this
population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and
humans---whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, and
explored by the mind: that I know.

In this world---with its gods, [Māras]{lang="sa"}, and Divinities, this
population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and
humans---whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, and
explored by the mind: that I have insight into. That has been known by a
Realized One, but a Realized One is not subject to it.

If I were to say that 'I do not know ... the world with its gods', I
would be lying.

If I were to say that 'I both know and do not know ... the world with
its gods', that would be just the same.

If I were to say that 'I neither know nor do not know ... the world with
its gods', that would be my fault.

So a Realized One sees what is to be seen, but does not conceive what is
seen, does not conceive what is unseen, does not conceive what is to be
seen, and does not conceive a seer. He hears what is to be heard, but
does not conceive what is heard, does not conceive what is unheard, does
not conceive what is to be heard, and does not conceive a hearer. He
thinks what is to be thought, but does not conceive what is thought,
does not conceive what is not thought, does not conceive what is to be
thought, and does not conceive a thinker. He knows what is to be known,
but does not conceive what is known, does not conceive what is unknown,
does not conceive what is to be known, and does not conceive a knower.

Since a Realized One is unaffected in the midst of things able to be
seen, heard, thought, and known, he is the unaffected one. And I say
that there is no better or finer poise than this.

> Such a one does not take anything\
> seen, heard, or thought to be ultimately true or false.\
> But others get attached, thinking it's the truth,\
> limited by their preconceptions.
>
> Since they've seen this dart\
> to which people are attached and cling,\
> saying, 'I know, I see, that's how it is',\
> the Realized Ones have no attachments."

### N 4.25 The Spiritual Life  *Brahmacariyasutta* {#n-4.25-the-spiritual-life-brahmacariyasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, this spiritual life is not lived for the sake of deceiving
people or flattering them, nor for the benefit of possessions, honor, or
popularity, nor for the benefit of winning debates, nor thinking, 'So
let people know about me!' This spiritual life is lived for the sake of
restraint, giving up, fading away, and cessation.

> The Buddha taught the spiritual life\
> not because of tradition,\
> but for the sake of restraint and giving up,\
> and because it culminates in extinguishment.\
> This is the path followed by the great souls,\
> the great seers.
>
> Those who practice it\
> as it was taught by the Buddha,\
> doing the teacher's bidding,\
> make an end of suffering."

### N 4.26 Deceivers  *Kuhasutta* {#n-4.26-deceivers-kuhasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, those mendicants who are deceivers and flatterers, pompous
and fake, insolent, and scattered: those mendicants are no followers of
mine. They've left this teaching and training, and they don't achieve
growth, improvement, or maturity in this teaching and training.

But those mendicants who are genuine, not flatterers, attentive,
amenable, and serene: those mendicants are followers of mine. They
haven't left this teaching and training, and they achieve growth,
improvement, or maturity in this teaching and training.

> Those who are deceivers and flatterers,\

### N 4.27 Contentment  *Santuṭṭhisutta* {#n-4.27-contentment-santuṭṭhisutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, these four trifles are easy to find and are blameless. What
four? Rag-robes ... A lump of almsfood ... Lodgings at the root of a
tree ... Rancid urine as medicine ...

These four trifles are easy to find and are blameless. When a mendicant
is content with trifles that are easy to find, they have one of the
factors of the ascetic life, I say.

> When you're content with what's blameless,\
> trifling, and easy to find,\
> you don't get upset\
> about lodgings, robes,\
> food, and drink,\
> and you're not obstructed anywhere.
>
> These qualities are said to be\
> integral to the ascetic life.\
> They're mastered by one who trains,\
> content and diligent."

### N 4.28 The Noble Traditions  *Ariyavaṁsasutta* {#n-4.28-the-noble-traditions-ariyavaṁsasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, these four noble traditions are primordial, long-standing,
traditional, and ancient. They are uncorrupted, as they have been since
the beginning. They're not being corrupted now, nor will they be.
Sensible ascetics and brahmins don't look down on them. What four?

Firstly, a mendicant is content with any kind of robe, and praises such
contentment. They don't try to get hold of a robe in an improper way.
They don't get upset if they don't get a robe. And if they do get a
robe, they use it untied, uninfatuated, unattached, seeing the drawback,
and understanding the escape. But they don't glorify themselves or put
others down on account of their contentment. A mendicant who is deft,
tireless, aware, and mindful in this is said to stand in the ancient,
primordial noble tradition.

Furthermore, a mendicant is content with any kind of almsfood ...

Furthermore, a mendicant is content with any kind of lodgings ...

Furthermore, a mendicant enjoys meditation and loves to meditate. They
enjoy giving up and love to give up. But they don't glorify themselves
or put down others on account of their love for meditation and giving
up. A mendicant who is deft, tireless, aware, and mindful in this is
said to stand in the ancient, primordial noble tradition.

These four noble traditions are primordial, long-standing, traditional,
and ancient. They are uncorrupted, as they have been since the
beginning. They're not being corrupted now nor will they be. Sensible
ascetics and brahmins don't look down on them.

When a mendicant has these four noble traditions, if they live in the
east they prevail over discontent, and discontent doesn't prevail over
them. If they live in the west ... the north ... the south, they prevail
over discontent, and discontent doesn't prevail over them. Why is that?
Because the attentive prevail over desire and discontent.

> Discontent cannot prevail over the attentive;\
> the attentive are not prevailed over by discontent.\
> The attentive can prevail over discontent,\
> for the attentive are those who prevail over discontent.
>
> Who can hold back the dispeller,\
> who's thrown away all deeds?\
> Like a pendant of Black Plum River gold,\
> who is worthy to criticize them?\
> Even the gods praise them,\
> and by the Divinity, too, they're praised."

### N 4.29 Footprints of the Dhamma  *Dhammapadasutta* {#n-4.29-footprints-of-the-dhamma-dhammapadasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, these four footprints of the Dhamma are primordial,
long-standing, traditional, and ancient. They are uncorrupted, as they
have been since the beginning. They're not being corrupted now nor will
they be. Sensible ascetics and brahmins don't look down on them. What
four? Contentment, good will, right mindfulness, and right immersion.

These four footprints of the Dhamma are primordial, long-standing,
traditional, and ancient. They are uncorrupted, as they have been since
the beginning. They're not being corrupted now nor will they be.
Sensible ascetics and brahmins don't look down on them.

### N 4.30 Wanderers  *Paribbājakasutta* {#n-4.30-wanderers-paribbājakasutta .unnumbered}

At one time the Buddha was staying near [Rājagaha]{lang="sa"}, on the
Vulture's Peak Mountain.

Now at that time several very well-known wanderers were residing in the
monastery of the wanderers on the bank of the [Sappinī]{lang="sa"}
river. They included [Annabhāra]{lang="sa"}, Varadhara,
[Sakuludāyī]{lang="sa"}, and other very well-known wanderers. Then in
the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the
wanderer's monastery on the banks of the [Sappinī]{lang="sa"} river, He
sat down on the seat spread out, and said to the wanderers:

"Wanderers, these four footprints of the Dhamma are primordial,
long-standing, traditional, and ancient. They are uncorrupted, as they
have been since the beginning. They're not being corrupted now nor will
they be. Sensible ascetics and brahmins don't look down on them. What
four? Contentment ... Good will ... Right mindfulness ... Right
immersion ... These four footprints of the Dhamma are primordial,
long-standing, traditional, and ancient. They are uncorrupted, as they
have been since the beginning. They're not being corrupted now nor will
they be. Sensible ascetics and brahmins don't look down on them.

Wanderers, if someone should say: 'I'll reject this Dhamma footprint of
contentment, and describe a true ascetic or brahmin who covets sensual
pleasures with acute lust.' Then I'd say to them: 'Let them come, speak,
and discuss. We'll see how powerful they are.' It is quite impossible to
reject this Dhamma footprint of contentment, and point out a true
ascetic or brahmin who covets sensual pleasures with acute lust.

If someone should say: 'I'll reject this Dhamma footprint of good will,
and describe a true ascetic or brahmin who has ill will and malicious
intent.' Then I'd say to them: 'Let them come, speak, and discuss. We'll
see how powerful they are.' It is quite impossible to reject this Dhamma
footprint of good will, and point out a true ascetic or brahmin who has
ill will and malicious intent.

If someone should say: 'I'll reject this Dhamma footprint of right
mindfulness, and describe a true ascetic or brahmin who is unmindful,
with no situational awareness.' Then I'd say to them: 'Let them come,
speak, and discuss. We'll see how powerful they are.' It is quite
impossible to reject this Dhamma footprint of right mindfulness, and
point out a true ascetic or brahmin who is unmindful, with no
situational awareness.

If someone should say: 'I'll reject this Dhamma footprint of right
immersion, and describe a true ascetic or brahmin who is scattered, with
straying mind.' Then I'd say to them: 'Let them come, speak, and
discuss. We'll see how powerful they are.' It is quite impossible to
reject this Dhamma footprint of right immersion, and point out a true
ascetic or brahmin who is scattered, with straying mind.

If anyone imagines they can criticize and reject these four footprints
of the Dhamma, they deserve rebuttal and criticism on four legitimate
grounds in this very life. What four?

If you reject the Dhamma footprint of contentment, then you must honor
and praise those ascetics and brahmins who covet sensual pleasures with
acute lust.

If you reject the Dhamma footprint of good will, you must honor and
praise those ascetics and brahmins who have ill will and malicious
intent.

If you reject the Dhamma footprint of right mindfulness, then you must
honor and praise those ascetics and brahmins who are unmindful, with no
situational awareness.

If you reject the Dhamma footprint of right immersion, you must honor
and praise those ascetics and brahmins who are scattered, with straying
minds.

If anyone imagines they can criticize and reject these four footprints
of the Dhamma, they deserve rebuttal and criticism on four legitimate
grounds in this very life.

Even those wanderers of the past, Vassa and [Bhañña]{lang="sa"} of
[Ukkalā]{lang="sa"}, who adhered to the doctrines of no-cause, inaction,
and nihilism, didn't imagine that these four footprints of the Dhamma
should be criticized or rejected. Why is that? For fear of being blamed,
criticized, and faulted.

> One who has good will, ever mindful,\
> serene within,\
> training to remove desire,\
> is called 'a diligent one'."

## The Chapter on Situations  {#the-chapter-on-situations .unnumbered}

### N 4.31 Situations  *Cakkasutta* {#n-4.31-situations-cakkasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, there are these four situations. When these situations come
about, any god or human who takes advantage of them will soon acquire
great and abundant wealth. What four? Living in a suitable region,
relying on true persons, being rightly resolved in oneself, and past
merit.

These are the four situations. When these situations come about, any god
or human who takes advantage of them will soon acquire great and
abundant wealth.

### N 4.32 Inclusion  *Saṅgahasutta* {#n-4.32-inclusion-saṅgahasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, there are these four ways of being inclusive. What four?
Giving, kindly words, taking care, and equality.

These are the four ways of being inclusive.

> Giving and kindly words,\
> taking care here,\
> and equality in worldly conditions,\

### N 4.33 The Lion  *Sīhasutta* {#n-4.33-the-lion-sīhasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, towards evening the lion, king of beasts, emerges from his
den, yawns, looks all around the four quarters, and roars his lion's
roar three times. Then he sets out on the hunt. And the animals who hear
the roar of the lion, king of beasts, are typically filled with fear,
awe, and terror. They return to their lairs, be they in a hole, the
water, or a wood; and the birds take to the air. Even the royal
elephants, bound with strong harnesses in the villages, towns, and
capital cities, break apart their bonds, and urinate and defecate in
terror as they flee here and there. That's how powerful is the lion,
king of beasts, over animals, how illustrious and mighty.

In the same way, when a Realized One arises in the world---perfected, a
fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy,
knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher
of gods and humans, awakened, blessed---he teaches the Dhamma: 'Such is
substantial reality, such is the origin of substantial reality, such is
the cessation of substantial reality, such is the practice that leads to
the cessation of substantial reality.'

Now, there are gods who are long-lived, beautiful, and very happy,
lasting long in their divine palaces. When they hear this teaching by
the Realized One, they're typically filled with fear, awe, and terror.
'Oh no! It turns out we're impermanent, though we thought we were
permanent! It turns out we don't last, though we thought we were
everlasting! It turns out we're transient, though we thought we were
eternal! It turns out that we're impermanent, not lasting, transient,
and included within substantial reality.'

That's how powerful is the Realized One in the world with its gods, how
illustrious and mighty.

### N 4.34 The Best Kinds of Confidence  *Aggappasādasutta* {#n-4.34-the-best-kinds-of-confidence-aggappasādasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, these four kinds of confidence are the best. What four?

The Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, is said
to be the best of all sentient beings---be they footless, with two feet,
four feet, or many feet; with form or formless; with perception or
without perception or with neither perception nor non-perception. Those
who have confidence in the Buddha have confidence in the best. Having
confidence in the best, the result is the best.

The noble eightfold path is said to be the best of all conditioned
things. Those who have confidence in the noble eightfold path have
confidence in the best. Having confidence in the best, the result is the
best.

Fading away is said to be the best of all things whether conditioned or
unconditioned. That is, the quelling of vanity, the removing of thirst,
the abolishing of clinging, the breaking of the round, the ending of
craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment. Those who have
confidence in the teaching of fading away have confidence in the best.
Having confidence in the best, the result is the best.

The [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"} of the Realized One's disciples is said to be
the best of all communities and groups. It consists of the four pairs,
the eight individuals. This is the [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"} of the Buddha's
disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of
hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with
joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world. Those who
have confidence in the [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"} have confidence in the best.
Having confidence in the best, the result is the best.

These are the four best kinds of confidence.

> For those who, knowing the best teaching,\
> base their confidence on the best---\
> confident in the best Awakened One,\
> supremely worthy of a religious donation;
>
> confident in the best teaching,\
> the bliss of fading and stilling;\
> confident in the best [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"},\
> the supreme field of merit---
>
> giving gifts to the best,\
> the best of merit grows:\
> the best lifespan, beauty,\
> fame, reputation, happiness, and strength.
>
> An intelligent person gives to the best,\
> settled on the best teaching.\
> When they become a god or human,\
> they rejoice at reaching the best."

### N 4.35 With Vassakāra  *Vassakārasutta* {#n-4.35-with-vassakāra-vassakārasutta .unnumbered}

At one time the Buddha was staying near [Rājagaha]{lang="sa"}, in the
Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding ground. Then [Vassakāra]{lang="sa"}
the brahmin, a chief minister of Magadha, went up to the Buddha, and
exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation
were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:

"Mister Gotama, when someone has four qualities we describe him as a
great man with great wisdom. What four?

They are very learned in diverse fields of learning.

They understand the meaning of diverse statements, saying: 'This is what
that statement means; that is what this statement means.'

They are mindful, able to remember and recollect what was said and done
long ago.

They are deft and tireless in household duties, understanding how to go
about things in order to complete and organize the work.

When someone has these four qualities we describe him as a great man
with great wisdom. If Mister Gotama agrees with me, please say so. If he
disagrees, please say so."

"Brahmin, I neither agree nor disagree with you, but when someone has
four qualities I describe him as a great man with great wisdom. What
four?

It's when someone practices for the welfare and happiness of the people.
They've established many people in the noble system, that is, the
principles of goodness and skillfulness.

They think what they want to think, and don't think what they don't want
to think. They consider what they want to consider, and don't consider
what they don't want to consider. Thus they have achieved mental mastery
of the paths of thought.

They get the four absorptions---blissful meditations in this life that
belong to the higher mind---when they want, without trouble or
difficulty.

They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in
this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight
due to the ending of defilements.

Brahmin, I neither agree nor disagree with you, but when someone has
these four qualities I describe him as a great man with great wisdom."

"It's incredible, Mister Gotama, it's amazing! How well said this was by
Mister Gotama! And we will remember Mister Gotama as someone who has
these four qualities. For Mister Gotama practices for the welfare and
happiness of the people ... Mister Gotama has achieved mental mastery of
the paths of thought. Mister Gotama gets the four absorptions ... when
he wants, without trouble or difficulty. Mister Gotama has realized the
undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. He
lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of
defilements."

"Your words are clearly invasive and intrusive, brahmin. Nevertheless, I
will answer you. For I do practice for the welfare and happiness of the
people ... I have achieved mental mastery of the paths of thought. I do
get the four absorptions ... when I want, without trouble or difficulty.
I have realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in
this very life. I live having realized it with my own insight due to the
ending of defilements.

> He discovered release from the snare of death\
> for all beings,\
> and explained the system of the teaching\
> for the welfare of gods and humans.\
> When they see him or hear him,\
> many people become confident.
>
> He is skilled in what is the path\
> \>and what is not the path,\
> he has completed the task\
> \>and is free of defilements.\
> The Buddha, bearing his final body,\
> is called 'a great man, of great wisdom'."

### N 4.36 Doṇa  *Doṇasutta* {#n-4.36-doṇa-doṇasutta .unnumbered}

At one time the Buddha was traveling along the road between
[Ukkaṭṭhā]{lang="sa"} and [Setavyā]{lang="sa"}, as was the brahmin
[Doṇa]{lang="sa"}.

[Doṇa]{lang="sa"} saw that the Buddha's footprints had thousand-spoked
wheels, with rims and hubs, complete in every detail. It occurred to
him, "Oh, how incredible, how amazing! Surely these couldn't be the
footprints of a human being?"

The Buddha had left the road and sat at the root of a tree cross-legged,
setting his body straight, and establishing mindfulness in his presence.

Then [Doṇa]{lang="sa"}, following the Buddha's footprints, saw him
sitting at the tree root---impressive and inspiring, with peaceful
faculties and mind, attained to the highest self-control and serenity,
like an elephant with tamed, guarded, and controlled faculties. He went
up to the Buddha and said to him:

"Sir, might you be a god?"

"I will not be a god, brahmin."

"Might you be a centaur?"

"I will not be a centaur."

"Might you be a native spirit?"

"I will not be a native spirit."

"Might you be a human?"

"I will not be a human."

"When asked whether you might be a god, centaur, native spirit, or
human, you answer that you will not be any of these. What then might you
be?"

"Brahmin, if I had not given up defilements I might have become a god
... a centaur ... a native spirit ... or a human. But I have given up
those defilements, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm
stump, obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future.

Suppose there was a blue water lily, or a pink or white lotus. Though it
sprouted and grew in the water, it would rise up above the water and
stand with no water clinging to it. In the same way, though I was born
and grew up in the world, I live having mastered the world, unsullied by
the world.

Remember me, brahmin, as a Buddha.

> I could have been reborn as a god,\
> or as a centaur flying through the sky.\
> I could have become a native spirit,\
> or returned as a human.\
> But I've ended those defilements,\
> they're blown away and mown down.
>
> Like a graceful lotus,\
> to which water does not cling,\
> the world doesn't cling to me,\
> and so, brahmin, I am a Buddha."

### N 4.37 Non-decline  *Aparihāniyasutta* {#n-4.37-non-decline-aparihāniyasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, a mendicant who has four qualities can't decline, and has
drawn near to extinguishment. What four? A mendicant is accomplished in
ethics, guards the sense doors, eats in moderation, and is dedicated to
wakefulness.

And how is a mendicant accomplished in ethics? It's when a mendicant is
ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and
resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest
fault, they keep the rules they've undertaken. That's how a mendicant is
accomplished in ethics.

And how does a mendicant guard the sense doors? When a mendicant sees a
sight with their eyes, they don't get caught up in the features and
details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful
qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For
this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight,
and achieving restraint over it. Hearing a sound with their ears ...
Smelling an odor with their nose ... Tasting a flavor with their tongue
... Feeling a touch with their body ... Knowing an idea with their mind,
they don't get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of
mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness
and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they
practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving
restraint over it. That's how a mendicant guards the sense doors.

And how does a mendicant eat in moderation? It's when a mendicant
reflects rationally on the food that they eat: 'Not for fun, indulgence,
adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm,
and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to
old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will have the
means to keep going, blamelessness, and a comfortable abiding.' That's
how a mendicant eats in moderation.

And how is a mendicant dedicated to wakefulness? It's when a mendicant
practices walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying their mind
from obstacles. In the first watch of the night, they continue to
practice walking and sitting meditation. In the middle watch, they lie
down in the lion's posture---on the right side, placing one foot on top
of the other---mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.
In the last watch, they get up and continue to practice walking and
sitting meditation, purifying their mind from obstacles. This is how a
mendicant is dedicated to wakefulness. A mendicant who has these four
qualities can't decline, and has drawn near to extinguishment.

> Established in ethics,\
> restrained in the sense faculties,\
> eating in moderation,\
> and dedicated to wakefulness;
>
> a mendicant lives like this, with keen energy,\
> tireless all night and day,\
> developing skillful qualities,\
> for the sake of sanctuary from the yoke.
>
> A mendicant who loves to be diligent,\
> seeing fear in negligence,\
> can't decline,\
> and has drawn near to extinguishment."

### N 4.38 Withdrawn  *Patilīnasutta* {#n-4.38-withdrawn-patilīnasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, a mendicant has eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of
the truth, has totally given up searching, has stilled the physical
process, and is said to be 'withdrawn'.

And how has a mendicant eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the
truth? Different ascetics and brahmins have different idiosyncratic
interpretations of the truth. For example: the cosmos is eternal, or not
eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are the same
thing, or they are different things; after death, a realized one still
exists, or no longer exists, or both still exists and no longer exists,
or neither still exists nor no longer exists. A mendicant has dispelled,
eliminated, thrown out, rejected, let go of, given up, and relinquished
all these. That's how a mendicant has eliminated idiosyncratic
interpretations of the truth.

And how has a mendicant totally given up searching? It's when they've
given up searching for sensual pleasures, for continued existence, and
for a spiritual path. That's how a mendicant has totally given up
searching.

And how has a mendicant stilled the physical process? It's when, giving
up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they
enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain,
with pure equanimity and mindfulness. That's how a mendicant has stilled
the physical process.

And how is a mendicant withdrawn? It's when they've given up the conceit
'I am', cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated
it, so it's unable to arise in the future. That's how a mendicant is
withdrawn. A mendicant has eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of
the truth, has totally given up searching, has stilled the physical
process, and is said to be 'withdrawn'.

> The search for sensual pleasures, for a good rebirth,\
> and the search for a spiritual path;\
> the holding tight to the thought, 'this is the truth',\
> and the mass of grounds for views---
>
> for one detached from all lusts,\
> freed by the ending of craving,\
> that searching has been relinquished,\
> and those viewpoints eradicated.
>
> That mendicant is peaceful and mindful,\
> a tranquil champion.\
> And when they're awakened\
> \>by comprehending conceit,\
> they're called 'withdrawn'."

### N 4.39 With Ujjaya  *Ujjayasutta* {#n-4.39-with-ujjaya-ujjayasutta .unnumbered}

Then Ujjaya the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings
with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat
down to one side and said to the Buddha:

"Does Mister Gotama praise sacrifice?"

"Brahmin, I don't praise all sacrifices. Nor do I criticize all
sacrifices. Take the kind of sacrifice where cattle, goats and sheep,
chickens and pigs, and various kinds of creatures are slaughtered. I
criticize that kind of violent sacrifice. Why is that? Because neither
perfected ones nor those who are on the path to perfection will attend
such a violent sacrifice.

But take the kind of sacrifice where cattle, goats and sheep, chickens
and pigs, and various kinds of creatures are not slaughtered. I praise
that kind of non-violent sacrifice; for example, a regular gift as an
ongoing family sacrifice. Why is that? Because perfected ones and those
who are on the path to perfection will attend such a non-violent
sacrifice.

> Horse sacrifice, human sacrifice,\
> the sacrifices of the 'casting of the yoke-pin',\

### N 4.40 With Udāyī  *Udāyīsutta* {#n-4.40-with-udāyī-udāyīsutta .unnumbered}

Then [Udāyī]{lang="sa"} the brahmin went up to the Buddha, ... and asked
him, "Does Mister Gotama praise sacrifice?"

"Brahmin, I don't praise all sacrifices. Nor do I criticize all
sacrifices. ... Take the kind of sacrifice where cattle, goats and
sheep, chickens and pigs, and various kinds of animals are slaughtered.
I don't praise that kind of violent sacrifice.

But take the kind of sacrifice where cattle, goats and sheep, chickens
and pigs, and various kinds of animals are not slaughtered. I do praise
that kind of non-violent sacrifice; for example, a regular gift as an

## The Chapter with Rohitassa  {#the-chapter-with-rohitassa .unnumbered}

### N 4.41 Ways of Developing Immersion Further  *Samādhibhāvanāsutta* {#n-4.41-ways-of-developing-immersion-further-samādhibhāvanāsutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, there are these four ways of developing immersion further.
What four? There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to
blissful meditation in this life. There is a way of developing immersion
further that leads to gaining knowledge and vision. There is a way of
developing immersion further that leads to mindfulness and awareness.
There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to the ending
of defilements.

And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to
blissful meditation in this life? It's when a mendicant, quite secluded
from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and
remains in the first absorption ... second absorption ... third
absorption ... fourth absorption. This is the way of developing
immersion further that leads to blissful meditation in this life.

And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to
gaining knowledge and vision? It's when a mendicant applies their mind
to the perception of light, focusing on the perception of day: as by
day, so by night; as by night, so by day. And so, with an open and
unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that's full of radiance. This is
the way of developing immersion further that leads to gaining knowledge
and vision.

And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to
mindfulness and awareness? It's when a mendicant knows feelings as they
arise, as they remain, and as they go away. They know perceptions as
they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. They know thoughts as
they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. This is the way of
developing immersion further that leads to mindfulness and awareness.

And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to the
ending of defilements? It's when a mendicant meditates observing rise
and fall in the five grasping aggregates. 'Such is form, such is the
origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is feeling, such is the
origin of feeling, such is the ending of feeling. Such is perception,
such is the origin of perception, such is the ending of perception. Such
are choices, such is the origin of choices, such is the ending of
choices. Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness,
such is the ending of consciousness.' This is the way of developing
immersion further that leads to the ending of defilements.

These are the four ways of developing immersion further. And it was in
this connection that I said in 'The Way to the Far Shore', in 'The
Questions of [Puṇṇaka]{lang="sa"}':

> 'Having appraised the world high and low,\
> there is nothing in the world that disturbs them.\
> Peaceful, unclouded, untroubled,\
> \>with no need for hope,\
> they've crossed over rebirth and old age, I declare.'"

These are the four ways of answering questions.

### N 4.45 With Rohitassa  *Rohitassasutta* {#n-4.45-with-rohitassa-rohitassasutta .unnumbered}

At one time the Buddha was staying near [Sāvatthī]{lang="sa"} in Jeta's
Grove, [Anāthapiṇḍika]{lang="sa"}'s monastery.

Then, late at night, the glorious god Rohitassa, lighting up the entire
Jeta's Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said
to him:

"Sir, is it possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by
traveling to a place where there's no being born, growing old, dying,
passing away, or being reborn?"

"Reverend, I say it's not possible to know or see or reach the end of
the world by traveling to a place where there's no being born, growing
old, dying, passing away, or being reborn."

"It's incredible, sir, it's amazing, how well said this was by the
Buddha.

Once upon a time, I was a seer called Rohitassa of the Bhoja people. I
was a sky-walker with psychic powers. I was as fast as a light arrow
easily shot across the shadow of a palm tree by a well-trained expert
archer with a strong bow. My stride was such that it could span from the
eastern ocean to the western ocean. Having such speed and stride, this
wish came to me: 'I will reach the end of the world by traveling.' I
traveled for my whole lifespan of a hundred years---pausing only to eat
and drink, go to the toilet, and sleep to dispel weariness---and I
passed away along the way, never reaching the end of the world.

It's incredible, sir, it's amazing, how well said this was by the
Buddha."

"Reverend, I say it's not possible to know or see or reach the end of
the world by traveling to a place where there's no being born, growing
old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. But I also say there's no
making an end of suffering without reaching the end of the world. For it
is in this fathom-long carcass with its perception and mind that I
describe the world, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that
leads to its cessation.

> The end of the world can never\
> be reached by traveling.\
> But without reaching the end of the world,\
> there's no release from suffering.
>
> So an intelligent person, understanding the world,\
> has completed the spiritual journey,\

> A calm one, knowing the end of the world,\
> does not hope for this world or the next."

Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
"Tonight, the glorious god Rohitassa, lighting up the entire Jeta's

### N 4.48 With Visākha, Pañcāli's Son  *Visākhasutta* {#n-4.48-with-visākha-pañcālis-son-visākhasutta .unnumbered}

At one time the Buddha was staying near [Sāvatthī]{lang="sa"} in Jeta's
Grove, [Anāthapiṇḍika]{lang="sa"}'s monastery.

Now at that time Venerable [Visākha]{lang="sa"}, [Pañcāli]{lang="sa"}'s
son, was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants
in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk. His words were polished, clear,
articulate, expressing the meaning, comprehensive, and independent.

Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to
the assembly hall. He sat down on the seat spread out, and addressed the
mendicants, "Mendicants, who was educating, encouraging, firing up, and
inspiring the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk?"

"Sir, it was Venerable [Visākha]{lang="sa"}, [Pañcāli]{lang="sa"}'s
son."

Then the Buddha said to [Visākha]{lang="sa"}, "Good, good,
[Visākha]{lang="sa"}! It's good that you educate, encourage, fire up,
and inspire the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk, with
words that are polished, clear, articulate, expressing the meaning,
comprehensive, and independent.

> Though an astute person is mixed up with fools,\

These are the four corrections of perception, mind, and view.

## The Chapter on Overflowing Merit  {#the-chapter-on-overflowing-merit .unnumbered}

### N 4.51 Overflowing Merit  *Paṭhamapuññābhisandasutta* {#n-4.51-overflowing-merit-paṭhamapuññābhisandasutta .unnumbered}

At [Sāvatthī]{lang="sa"}.

"Mendicants, there are these four kinds of overflowing merit,
overflowing goodness. They nurture happiness and are conducive to
heaven, ripening in happiness and leading to heaven. They lead to what
is likable, desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness. What four?

When a mendicant enters and remains in a limitless immersion of heart
while using a robe, the overflowing of merit for the donor is limitless
...

When a mendicant enters and remains in a limitless immersion of heart
while eating almsfood, the overflowing of merit for the donor is
limitless ...

When a mendicant enters and remains in a limitless immersion of heart
while using lodgings, the overflowing of merit for the donor is
limitless ...

When a mendicant enters and remains in a limitless immersion of heart
while using medicines and supplies for the sick, the overflowing of
merit for the donor is limitless ...

These are the four kinds of overflowing merit, overflowing goodness.
They nurture happiness and are conducive to heaven, ripening in
happiness and leading to heaven. They lead to what is likable,
desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness.

When a noble disciple has these four kinds of overflowing merit and
goodness, it's not easy to grasp how much merit they have by saying that
this is the extent of their overflowing merit ... that leads to
happiness. It's simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great
mass of merit.

It's like trying to grasp how much water is in the ocean. It's not easy
to say how many gallons, how many hundreds, thousands, hundreds of
thousands of gallons there are. It's simply reckoned as an incalculable,
immeasurable, great mass of water.

In the same way, when a noble disciple has these four kinds of
overflowing merit it's simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable,
great mass of merit.

> Hosts of people use the rivers,\
> and though the rivers are many,\
> all reach the great deep, the boundless ocean,\
> the cruel sea that's home to precious gems.
>
> In the same way, when a person gives\
> \>food, drink, and clothes;\
> and they're a giver of beds, seats, and mats---\
> the streams of merit reach that astute person,\
> as the rivers bring their waters to the sea."

### N 4.52 Overflowing Merit (2nd)  *Dutiyapuññābhisandasutta* {#n-4.52-overflowing-merit-2nd-dutiyapuññābhisandasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, there are these four kinds of overflowing merit,
overflowing goodness. They nurture happiness and are conducive to
heaven, ripening in happiness and leading to heaven. They lead to what
is likable, desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness. What four?

It's when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha:
'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in
knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for
those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.'
This is the first kind of overflowing merit ...

Furthermore, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the
teaching: 'The teaching is well explained by the Buddha---apparent in
the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant,
so that sensible people can know it for themselves.' This is the second
kind of overflowing merit ...

Furthermore, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the
[Saṅgha]{lang="sa"}: 'The [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"} of the Buddha's disciples
is practicing the way that's good, sincere, systematic, and proper. It
consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the
[Saṅgha]{lang="sa"} of the Buddha's disciples that is worthy of
offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a
religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the
supreme field of merit for the world.' This is the third kind of
overflowing merit ...

Furthermore, a noble disciple's ethical conduct is loved by the noble
ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised
by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. This is the
fourth kind of overflowing merit ...

These are the four kinds of overflowing merit, overflowing goodness.
They nurture happiness and are conducive to heaven, ripening in
happiness and leading to heaven. They lead to what is likable,
desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness.

> Whoever has faith in the Realized One,\
> unwavering and well grounded;\
> whose ethical conduct is good,\
> praised and loved by the noble ones;
>
> who has confidence in the [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"},\
> and correct view:\

### N 4.53 Living Together (1st)  *Paṭhamasaṁvāsasutta* {#n-4.53-living-together-1st-paṭhamasaṁvāsasutta .unnumbered}

At one time the Buddha was traveling along the road between
[Madhurā]{lang="sa"} and [Verañjā]{lang="sa"}, as were several
householders, both women and men. The Buddha left the road and sat at
the root of a tree, where the householders saw him.

They went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha
said to them:

"Householders, there are four ways of living together. What four?

1.  A male zombie living with a female zombie;

2.  a male zombie living with a goddess;

3.  a god living with a female zombie;

4.  a god living with a goddess.

And how does a male zombie live with a female zombie? It's when the
husband kills living creatures, steals, commits sexual misconduct, lies,
and consumes beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants. He's unethical, of bad
character, living at home with his heart full of the stain of
stinginess, abusing and insulting ascetics and brahmins. And the wife is
also ... unethical, of bad character ... That's how a male zombie lives
with a female zombie.

And how does a male zombie live with a goddess? It's when the husband
... is unethical, of bad character ... But the wife doesn't kill living
creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or consume beer, wine,
and liquor intoxicants. She's ethical, of good character, living at home
with her heart rid of the stain of stinginess, not abusing and insulting
ascetics and brahmins. That's how a male zombie lives with a goddess.

And how does a god live with a female zombie? It's when the husband ...
is ethical, of good character ... But the wife ... is unethical, of bad
character ... That's how a god lives with a female zombie.

And how does a god live with a goddess? It's when the husband ... is
ethical, of good character ... And the wife is also ... ethical, of good
character ... That's how a god lives with a goddess.

These are the four ways of living together.

> When both are unethical,\
> miserly and abusive,\
> then wife and husband\
> live together as zombies.
>
> When the husband is unethical,\
> miserly and abusive,\
> but the wife is ethical,\
> bountiful, rid of stinginess,\
> she's a goddess living\
> with a zombie for a husband.
>
> When the husband is ethical,\
> bountiful, rid of stinginess,\
> but the wife is unethical,\
> miserly and abusive,\
> she's a zombie living\
> with a god for a husband.
>
> When both are faithful and bountiful,\
> disciplined, living righteously,\
> then wife and husband\
> say nice things to each other.
>
> They get all the things they need,\
> so they live at ease.\
> Their enemies are downhearted,\
> when both are equal in ethics.
>
> Having practiced the teaching here,\
> both equal in precepts and observances,\
> they delight in the heavenly realm,\
> enjoying all the pleasures they desire."

### N 4.54 Living Together (2nd)  *Dutiyasaṁvāsasutta* {#n-4.54-living-together-2nd-dutiyasaṁvāsasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, there are four ways of living together. What four?

1.  A male zombie living with a female zombie;

2.  a male zombie living with a goddess;

3.  a god living with a female zombie;

4.  a god living with a goddess.

And how does a male zombie live with a female zombie? It's when the
husband kills living creatures, steals, commits sexual misconduct; he
uses speech that's false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and he's
covetous, malicious, and has wrong view. He's unethical, of bad
character, living at home with his heart full of the stain of
stinginess, abusing and insulting ascetics and brahmins. And the wife is
also ... unethical, of bad character ... That's how a male zombie lives
with a female zombie.

And how does a male zombie live with a goddess? It's when the husband
... is unethical, of bad character ... But the wife doesn't kill living
creatures, steal, or commit sexual misconduct. She doesn't use speech
that's false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And she's contented,
kind-hearted, with right view. She's ethical, of good character, living
at home with her heart rid of the stain of stinginess, not abusing and
insulting ascetics and brahmins. That's how a male zombie lives with a
goddess.

And how does a god live with a female zombie? It's when the husband ...
is ethical, of good character ... But the wife ... is unethical, of bad
character ... That's how a god lives with a female zombie.

And how does a god live with a goddess? It's when the husband ... is
ethical, of good character ... And the wife is also ... ethical, of good
character ... That's how a god lives with a goddess.

These are the four ways of living together." ...

### N 4.55 Equality (1st)  *Paṭhamasamajīvīsutta* {#n-4.55-equality-1st-paṭhamasamajīvīsutta .unnumbered}

[So I have heard.]{.smallcaps} At one time the Buddha was staying in the
land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at
[Bhesakaḷā]{lang="sa"}'s Wood.

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
went to the home of the householder Nakula's father, where he sat on the
seat spread out.

Then the householder Nakula's father and the housewife Nakula's mother
went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Nakula's father
said to the Buddha, "Sir, ever since we were both young, and Nakula's
mother was given to me in marriage, I can't recall betraying her even in
thought, still less in deed. We want to see each other in both this life
and the next."

Then Nakula's mother said to the Buddha, "Sir, ever since we were both
young, and I was given in marriage to Nakula's father, I can't recall
betraying him even in thought, still less in deed. We want to see each
other in both this life and the next."

"Householders, if wife and husband want to see each other in both this
life and the next, they should be equals in faith, ethics, generosity,
and wisdom.

> When both are faithful and bountiful,\
> disciplined, living righteously,\
> then wife and husband\

"Mendicants, if wife and husband want to see each other in both this
life and the next, they should be equals in faith, ethics, generosity,
and wisdom. ..."

### N 4.57 Suppavāsā  *Suppavāsāsutta* {#n-4.57-suppavāsā-suppavāsāsutta .unnumbered}

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Koliyans, where
they have a town named Pajjanika.

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
went to the home of [Suppavāsā]{lang="sa"} the Koliyan, where he sat on
the seat spread out. Then [Suppavāsā]{lang="sa"} served and satisfied
the Buddha with her own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.
When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, she sat down to
one side. The Buddha said to her:

"[Suppavāsā]{lang="sa"}, when a noble disciple gives food, she gives the
recipients four things. What four? Long life, beauty, happiness, and
strength. Giving long life, she has long life as a god or human. Giving
beauty, she has beauty as a god or human. Giving happiness, she has
happiness as a god or human. Giving strength, she has strength as a god
or human. When a noble disciple gives food, she gives the recipients
these four things.

> When she gives well-prepared food,\
> pure, fine, and full of flavor,\
> that offering---given to the sincere,\
> who have good conduct, and are big-hearted---\
> joins merit to merit. It's very fruitful,\
> and is praised by those who know the world.

> Those who recall such sacrifices,\
> live in the world full of inspiration.\
> They've driven out the stain of stinginess,\
> \>root and all,\
> blameless, they go to a heavenly place."

### N 4.58 Sudatta  *Sudattasutta* {#n-4.58-sudatta-sudattasutta .unnumbered}

Then the householder [Anāthapiṇḍika]{lang="sa"} went up to the Buddha,
bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:

"Householder, when a noble disciple gives food, they give the recipients
four things. What four? Long life, beauty, happiness, and strength.
Giving long life, they have long life as a god or human. ... Giving
beauty ... happiness ... strength ... When a noble disciple gives food,
they give the recipients these four things.

> Carefully giving food at the right time,\

> \>eating only what others give,\

> A person who gives long life, beauty,\

> wherever they're reborn."

### N 4.59 Food  *Bhojanasutta* {#n-4.59-food-bhojanasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, when a donor gives food, they give the recipients four
things. What four? Long life, beauty, happiness, and strength. ..."

### N 4.60 Lay Practice  *Gihisāmīcisutta* {#n-4.60-lay-practice-gihisāmīcisutta .unnumbered}

Then the householder [Anāthapiṇḍika]{lang="sa"} went up to the Buddha,
bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:

"Householder, when a noble disciple does four things they are practicing
appropriately for a layperson, which brings fame and leads to heaven.
What four? It's when a noble disciple serves the mendicant
[Saṅgha]{lang="sa"} with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and
supplies for the sick. When a noble disciple does these four things they
are practicing appropriately for a layperson, which brings fame and
leads to heaven.

> Those who are astute practice the way\
> that's appropriate for laypeople.\
> They provide those who are ethical\
> and rightly comported with robes,
>
> almsfood, lodgings,\
> and supplies for the sick.\
> Their merit always grows\
> by day and by night.\
> They pass on to a place in heaven,\
> having done excellent deeds."

## The Chapter on Deeds of Substance  {#the-chapter-on-deeds-of-substance .unnumbered}

### N 4.61 Fitting Deeds  *Pattakammasutta* {#n-4.61-fitting-deeds-pattakammasutta .unnumbered}

Then the householder [Anāthapiṇḍika]{lang="sa"} went up to the Buddha,
bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:

"Householder, these four things, which are likable, desirable, and
agreeable are hard to get in the world. What four? The first thing is
the wish: 'May wealth come to me by legitimate means!'

The second thing, having got wealth by legitimate means, is the wish:
'May fame come to me, together with my family and teachers.'

The third thing, having got wealth and fame, is the wish: 'May I live
long, keeping alive for a long time!'

The fourth thing, having got wealth, fame, and long life, is the wish:
'When my body breaks up, after death, may I be reborn in a good place, a
heavenly realm!' These are the four things, which are likable,
desirable, and agreeable, but hard to get in the world.

These next four things lead to the getting of those four things. What
four? Accomplishment in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom.

And what is accomplishment in faith? It's when a noble disciple has
faith in the Realized One's awakening: 'That Blessed One is perfected, a
fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy,
knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher
of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.' This is called accomplishment in
faith.

And what is accomplishment in ethics? It's when a noble disciple doesn't
kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or consume
beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants. This is called accomplishment in
ethics.

And what is accomplishment in generosity? It's when a noble disciple
lives at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous,
open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and
to share. This is called accomplishment in generosity.

And what is accomplishment in wisdom? When your heart is mastered by
covetousness and immoral greed, you do what you shouldn't, and fail to
do what you should. Your fame and happiness fall to dust. When your
heart is mastered by ill will ... dullness and drowsiness ...
restlessness and remorse ... doubt, you do what you shouldn't, and fail
to do what you should. Your fame and happiness fall to dust.

Knowing that 'covetousness and immoral greed are corruptions of the
mind', that noble disciple gives them up. Knowing that 'ill will ...'
... 'dullness and drowsiness ...' ... 'restlessness and remorse ...' ...
'doubt is a corruption of the mind', that noble disciple gives it up.

When a noble disciple has given up these things, they're called 'a noble
disciple of great wisdom, of widespread wisdom, who sees what matters,
and is accomplished in wisdom'. This is called accomplishment in wisdom.
These are the four things that lead to the getting of the four things,
which are likable, desirable, and agreeable, but hard to get in the
world.

There are four fitting deeds that a noble disciple does with the
legitimate wealth he has earned by his efforts and initiative, built up
with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow. What four?

To start with, with his legitimate wealth he makes himself happy and
pleased, keeping himself properly happy. He makes his mother and father
happy ... He makes his children, partners, bondservants, workers, and
staff happy ... He makes his friends and colleagues happy ... This is
his first expenditure in an appropriate sphere on a deserved and fitting
cause.

Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he defends himself against
threats from such things as fire, flood, rulers, bandits, or unloved
heirs. He keeps himself safe. This is his second expenditure in an
appropriate sphere on a deserved and fitting cause.

Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he makes five spirit-offerings:
to relatives, guests, ancestors, king, and deities. This is his third
expenditure in an appropriate sphere on a deserved and fitting cause.

Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he establishes an uplifting
religious donation for ascetics and brahmins---those who refrain from
intoxication and negligence, are settled in patience and sweetness, and
who tame, calm, and extinguish themselves---that's conducive to heaven,
ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven. This is his fourth expenditure
in an appropriate sphere on a deserved and fitting cause.

'these are the four fitting deeds that a noble disciple does with the
legitimate wealth he has earned by his efforts and initiative, built up
with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow.

Whatever wealth is spent on something other than these four fitting
deeds is said to not be expenditure in an appropriate sphere on a
deserved and fitting cause. But whatever wealth is spent on these four
fitting deeds is said to be expenditure in an appropriate sphere on a
deserved and fitting cause.

> 'I've enjoyed my wealth,\
> \>supporting those who depend on me;\
> I've overcome losses;\
> I've given uplifting religious donations;\
> and made the five spirit-offerings.\
> I have served the ethical and\
> disciplined spiritual practitioners.
>
> I've achieved the purpose\
> for which an astute lay person\
> wishes to gain wealth.\
> I don't regret what I've done.'
>
> A mortal person who recollects this\
> stands firm in the teaching of the noble ones.\
> They're praised in this life,\
> and they depart to rejoice in heaven."

### N 4.62 Debtlessness  *Ānaṇyasutta* {#n-4.62-debtlessness-ānaṇyasutta .unnumbered}

Then the householder [Anāthapiṇḍika]{lang="sa"} went up to the Buddha,
bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:

"Householder, these four kinds of happiness can be earned by a layperson
who enjoys sensual pleasures, depending on time and occasion. What four?
The happiness of ownership, using wealth, debtlessness, and
blamelessness.

And what is the happiness of ownership? It's when a gentleman owns
legitimate wealth that he has earned by his own efforts and initiative,
built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow. When he
reflects on this, he's filled with pleasure and happiness. This is
called 'the happiness of ownership'.

And what is the happiness of using wealth? It's when a gentleman uses
his legitimate wealth, and makes merit with it. When he reflects on
this, he's filled with pleasure and happiness. This is called 'the
happiness of using wealth'.

And what is the happiness of debtlessness? It's when a gentleman owes no
debt, large or small, to anyone. When he reflects on this, he's filled
with pleasure and happiness. This is called 'the happiness of
debtlessness'.

And what is the happiness of blamelessness? It's when a noble disciple
has blameless conduct by way of body, speech, and mind. When he reflects
on this, he's filled with pleasure and happiness. This is called 'the
happiness of blamelessness'.

These four kinds of happiness can be earned by a layperson who enjoys
sensual pleasures, depending on time and occasion.

> Knowing the happiness of debtlessness,\
> and the extra happiness of possession,\
> a mortal enjoying the happiness of using wealth,\
> then discerns clearly with wisdom.
>
> Discerning clearly, a clever person knows\
> both kinds of happiness:\
> the other kind is not worth a sixteenth part\
> of the happiness of blamelessness."

### N 4.63 Living with Divinity  *Brahmasutta* {#n-4.63-living-with-divinity-brahmasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, a family where the children honor their parents in their
home is said to live with divinity. A family where the children honor
their parents in their home is said to live with the first tutors. A
family where the children honor their parents in their home is said to
live with the old deities. A family where the children honor their
parents in their home is said to live with those worthy of offerings
dedicated to the gods.

'Divinity' is a term for your parents.

'First tutors' is a term for your parents.

'Old deities' is a term for your parents.

'Worthy of an offering dedicated to the gods' is a term for your
parents.

Why is that? Parents are very helpful to their children, they raise
them, nurture them, and show them the world.

> Parents are said to be 'Divinity'\
> and 'first tutors'.\
> They're worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods\
> \>from their children,\

### N 4.64 Hell  *Nirayasutta* {#n-4.64-hell-nirayasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, someone with four qualities is cast down to hell. What
four? They kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, and
lie. Someone with these four qualities is cast down to hell.

> Killing, stealing,\
> telling lies,\
> and visiting others' wives:\
> astute people don't praise these things."

### N 4.65 Appearance  *Rūpasutta* {#n-4.65-appearance-rūpasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, these four people are found in the world. What four? There
are those whose estimation of and confidence in others is based on their
appearance, on their voice, on their mortification, and on principle.

These are the four people found in the world.

> Those who judge on appearance,\

"Mendicants, these four people are found in the world. What four? The
greedy, the hateful, the delusional, and the conceited.

These are the four people found in the world.

### N 4.67 The Snake King  *Ahirājasutta* {#n-4.67-the-snake-king-ahirājasutta .unnumbered}

At one time the Buddha was staying near [Sāvatthī]{lang="sa"} in Jeta's
Grove, [Anāthapiṇḍika]{lang="sa"}'s monastery.

Now, at that time a monk in [Sāvatthī]{lang="sa"} passed away due to a
snake bite. Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat
down to one side, and said to him, "Sir, a monk in [Sāvatthī]{lang="sa"}
has passed away due to a snake bite."

"Mendicants, that monk mustn't have spread a mind of love to the four
royal snake families. If he had, he wouldn't have died due to a snake
bite.

What four? The royal snake families of [Virūpakkha]{lang="sa"},
[Erāpatha]{lang="sa"}, [Chabyāputta]{lang="sa"}, and
[Kaṇhāgotamaka]{lang="sa"}. ...

Mendicants, I urge you to spread a mind of love to the four royal snake
families, for your own safety, security, and protection.

At one time the Buddha was staying near [Rājagaha]{lang="sa"}, on the
Vulture's Peak Mountain, not long after Devadatta had left. There the
Buddha spoke to the mendicants about Devadatta:

"Possessions, honor, and popularity came to Devadatta for his own ruin
and downfall.

It's like a banana tree, or a bamboo, or a reed, all of which bear fruit
to their own ruin and downfall ...

It's like a mule, which becomes pregnant to its own ruin and downfall.
In the same way, possessions, honor, and popularity came to Devadatta

And what, mendicants, is the effort to restrain? It's when you generate
enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad,
unskillful qualities don't arise. This is called the effort to restrain.

And what, mendicants, is the effort to give up? It's when you generate
enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad,
unskillful qualities are given up. This is called the effort to give up.

And what, mendicants, is the effort to develop? It's when you generate
enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that
skillful qualities arise. This is called the effort to develop.

And what, mendicants, is the effort to preserve? It's when you generate
enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that
skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase,
mature, and are fulfilled by development. This is called the effort to
preserve.

These are the four efforts.

It's like a bride on the day or night she's first brought to her
husband's home. Right away she sets up a keen sense of conscience and
prudence for her mother and father in law, her husband, and even the
bondservants, workers, and staff. But after some time, because of living
together and familiarity, she'll even say to her mother and father in
law, or to her husband: 'Go away! What would you know?' In the same way,
on the day or night a mendicant first goes forth from the lay life to
homelessness, right away they set up a keen sense of conscience and
prudence for the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen, and even the
monastery workers and novices. But after some time, because of living

At one time the Buddha was staying between a pair of sal trees in the

mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Perhaps even a single mendicant has doubt or uncertainty regarding the
Buddha, the teaching, the [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"}, the path, or the
practice. So ask, mendicants! Don't regret it later, thinking: 'We were
in the Teacher's presence and we weren't able to ask the Buddha a

For a second time the Buddha addressed the mendicants: ... For a second
time, the mendicants kept silent.

For a third time the Buddha addressed the mendicants: ... For a third

Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:

"Mendicants, perhaps you don't ask out of respect for the Teacher. So
let a friend tell a friend." When this was said, the mendicants kept
silent. Then Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha:

"It's incredible, sir, it's amazing! I am quite confident that there's
not even a single mendicant in this [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"} who has doubt or
uncertainty regarding the Buddha, the teaching, the [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"},

hunters, chariot-makers, or scavengers---poor, with little to eat or
drink, where life is tough, and food and shelter are hard to find. And
they're ugly, unsightly, deformed, sickly---one-eyed, crippled, lame, or
half-paralyzed. They don't get to have food, drink, clothes, and
vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; or bed, house, and lighting.
And they do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body
breaks up, after death, they're reborn in a place of loss, a bad place,
the underworld, hell. That's how a person is dark and bound for

the exquisite ascetic of ascetics.

And how is a person a confirmed ascetic? It's when a mendicant is a
practicing trainee, who lives aspiring to the supreme sanctuary from the
yoke. It's like the eldest son of an anointed aristocratic king. He has
not yet been anointed, but is eligible, and has been confirmed in the
succession. In the same way, a mendicant is a practicing trainee, who
lives aspiring to the supreme sanctuary from the yoke. That's how a
person is a confirmed ascetic.

And how is a person a white lotus ascetic? It's when a mendicant

experience of the eight liberations. That's how a person is a white

the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life.
... And they have direct meditative experience of the eight liberations.

And how is a person an exquisite ascetic of ascetics? It's when a
mendicant usually uses only what they've been invited to accept---robes,
almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick---rarely
using them without invitation. When living with other spiritual
practitioners, they usually find themselves treated agreeably by them by
way of body, speech, and mind, and rarely disagreeably. And they are
usually presented with agreeable things by them, rarely with
disagreeable ones. They're healthy, so the various unpleasant
feelings---stemming from disorders of bile, phlegm, wind, or their
conjunction; or caused by change in weather, by not taking care of
yourself, by overexertion, or as the result of past deeds---usually
don't come up. They get the four absorptions---blissful meditations in
this life that belong to the higher mind---when they want, without
trouble or difficulty. And they realize the undefiled freedom of heart
and freedom by wisdom in this very life. ... That's how a person is an
exquisite ascetic of ascetics.

And if anyone should be rightly called an exquisite ascetic of ascetics,
it's me. For I usually use only what I've been invited to accept ...

Excellent, Mister Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the
overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the
lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see
what's there, Mister Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. I
go for refuge to Mister Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant
[Saṅgha]{lang="sa"}. From this day forth, may Mister Gotama remember me
as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."

## The Chapter with Kesi  {#the-chapter-with-kesi .unnumbered}

### N 4.111 With Kesi  *Kesisutta* {#n-4.111-with-kesi-kesisutta .unnumbered}

Then Kesi the horse trainer went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down
to one side. The Buddha said to him, "Kesi, you're known as a horse
trainer. Just how do you guide a horse in training?"

"Sir, I guide a horse in training sometimes gently, sometimes harshly,
and sometimes both gently and harshly."

"Kesi, what do you do with a horse in training that doesn't follow these
forms of training?"

"In that case, sir, I kill it. Why is that? So that I don't disgrace my
tradition.

But sir, the Buddha is the supreme guide for those who wish to train.
Just how do you guide a person in training?"

"Kesi, I guide a person in training sometimes gently, sometimes harshly,
and sometimes both gently and harshly.

The gentle way is this: 'This is good conduct by way of body, speech,
and mind. This is the result of good conduct by way of body, speech, and
mind. This is life as a god. This is life as a human.'

The harsh way is this: 'This is bad conduct by way of body, speech, and
mind. This is the result of bad conduct by way of body, speech, and
mind. This is life in hell. This is life as an animal. This is life as a
ghost.'

The both gentle and harsh way is this: 'This is good conduct ... this is
bad conduct ...'"

"Sir, what do you do with a person in training who doesn't follow these
forms of training?"

"In that case, Kesi, I kill them."

"Sir, it's not appropriate for the Buddha to kill living creatures. And
yet you say you kill them."

"It's true, Kesi, it's not appropriate for a Realized One to kill living
creatures. But when a person in training doesn't follow any of these
forms of training, the Realized One doesn't think they're worth advising
or instructing, and neither do their sensible spiritual companions. For
it is killing in the training of the Noble One when the Realized One
doesn't think they're worth advising or instructing, and neither do
their sensible spiritual companions."

"Well, they're definitely dead when the Realized One doesn't think
they're worth advising or instructing, and neither do their sensible
spiritual companions. Excellent, sir! ... From this day forth, may the
Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."

"Mendicants, a fine royal thoroughbred with four factors is worthy of a
king, fit to serve a king, and considered a factor of kingship. What
four? Integrity, speed, patience, and sweetness. A fine royal
thoroughbred with these four factors is worthy of a king. ...

In the same way, a mendicant with four qualities is worthy of offerings

four?

One fine thoroughbred is moved to act when it sees the shadow of the
goad, thinking: 'What task will the horse trainer have me do today? How
should I respond?' Some fine thoroughbreds are like that. This is the
first fine thoroughbred found in the world.

Furthermore, one fine thoroughbred isn't moved to act when it sees the
shadow of the goad, but only when its hairs are struck, thinking: 'What
task will the horse trainer have me do today? How should I respond?'
Some fine thoroughbreds are like that. This is the second fine
thoroughbred found in the world.

Furthermore, one fine thoroughbred isn't moved to act when it sees the

This is the third fine thoroughbred found in the world.

Furthermore, one fine thoroughbred isn't moved to act when it sees the
shadow of the goad, nor when its hairs are struck, nor when its hide is

One fine thoroughbred person hears about the suffering or death of a
woman or man in such and such village or town. They're moved to act by
this, and strive effectively. Applying themselves, they directly realize
the ultimate truth, and see it with penetrating wisdom. This person is

goad. Some fine thoroughbred people are like that. This is the first
fine thoroughbred person found in the world.

### N 4.114 A Royal Elephant  *Nāgasutta* {#n-4.114-a-royal-elephant-nāgasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, a royal bull elephant with four factors is worthy of a
king, fit to serve a king, and is considered a factor of kingship. What
four? A royal bull elephant listens, destroys, endures, and goes fast.

And how does a royal bull elephant listen? It's when a royal bull
elephant pays attention, applies the mind, concentrates wholeheartedly,
and actively listens to whatever task the elephant trainer has it do,
whether or not it has done it before. That's how a royal bull elephant
listens.

And how does a royal bull elephant destroy? It's when a royal bull
elephant in battle destroys elephants with their riders, horses with
their riders, chariots and charioteers, and foot soldiers. That's how a
royal bull elephant destroys.

And how does a royal bull elephant endure? It's when a royal bull
elephant in battle endures being struck by spears, swords, arrows, and
axes; it endures the thunder of the drums, kettledrums, horns, and
cymbals. That's how a royal bull elephant endures.

And how does a royal bull elephant go fast? It's when a royal bull
elephant swiftly goes in whatever direction the elephant trainer sends
it, whether or not it has been there before. That's how a royal bull
elephant goes fast. A royal bull elephant with four factors is worthy of
a king, fit to serve a king, and is considered a factor of kingship.

In the same way, a mendicant with four qualities is worthy of offerings
dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious
donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme
field of merit for the world. What four? A mendicant listens, destroys,
endures, and goes fast.

And how does a mendicant listen? It's when a mendicant pays attention,
applies the mind, concentrates wholeheartedly, and actively listens when
the teaching and training proclaimed by a Realized One is being taught.
That's how a mendicant listens.

And how does a mendicant destroy? It's when a mendicant doesn't tolerate
a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought. They don't tolerate any bad,
unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give them up, get rid of
them, eliminate them, and obliterate them. That's how a mendicant
destroys.

And how does a mendicant endure? It's when a mendicant endures cold,
heat, hunger, and thirst; the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and
reptiles; rude and unwelcome criticism; and they put up with physical
pain---sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, and
life-threatening. That's how a mendicant endures.

And how does a mendicant go fast? It's when a mendicant swiftly goes in
the direction they've never gone before in all this long time; that is,
the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the
ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment. That's how a
mendicant goes fast. A mendicant with these four qualities ... is the
supreme field of merit for the world."

### N 4.115 Things  *Ṭhānasutta* {#n-4.115-things-ṭhānasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, there are these four things. What four?

1.  There is a thing that's unpleasant to do, and doing it proves
    harmful.

2.  There is a thing that's unpleasant to do, but doing it proves
    beneficial.

3.  There is a thing that's pleasant to do, but doing it proves harmful.

4.  There is a thing that's pleasant to do, and doing it proves
    beneficial.

Take the thing that's unpleasant to do, and doing it proves harmful.
This is regarded as a thing that shouldn't be done on both grounds:
because it's unpleasant, and because doing it proves harmful. This is
regarded as a thing that shouldn't be done on both grounds.

Next, take the thing that's unpleasant to do, but doing it proves
beneficial. It is here that you can tell who is foolish and who is
astute in regard to human strength, energy, and vigor. A fool doesn't
reflect: 'Despite the fact that this thing is unpleasant to do, doing it
still proves beneficial.' They don't do that thing, so that proves
harmful. An astute person does reflect: 'Despite the fact that this
thing is unpleasant to do, doing it still proves beneficial.' They do
that thing, so that proves beneficial.

Next, take the thing that's pleasant to do, but doing it proves harmful.
It is here that you can tell who is foolish and who is astute in regard
to human strength, energy, and vigor. A fool doesn't reflect: 'Despite
the fact that this thing is pleasant to do, doing it still proves
harmful.' They do that thing, and so that proves harmful. An astute
person does reflect: 'Despite the fact that this thing is pleasant to
do, doing it still proves harmful.' They don't do that thing, so that
proves beneficial.

Next, take the thing that's pleasant to do, and doing it proves
beneficial. This is regarded as a thing that should be done on both
grounds: because it's pleasant, and because doing it proves beneficial.
This is regarded as a thing that should be done on both grounds.

These are the four things."

### N 4.116 Diligence  *Appamādasutta* {#n-4.116-diligence-appamādasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, you should be diligent in four situations. What four? Give
up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind; and develop good
conduct by way of body, speech, and mind. Don't neglect these things.
Give up wrong view; and develop right view. Don't neglect this.

A mendicant who has done these things does not fear death in lives to
come."

### N 4.117 Guarding  *Ārakkhasutta* {#n-4.117-guarding-ārakkhasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, in your own way you should practice diligence, mindfulness,
and guarding of the mind in four situations. What four?

'May my mind not be aroused by things that arouse greed.' In your own
way you should practice diligence, mindfulness, and guarding of the
mind.

'May my mind not be angered by things that provoke hate.' ...

'May my mind not be deluded by things that promote delusion.' ...

'May my mind not be intoxicated by things that intoxicate.' ...

When a mendicant's mind is no longer affected by greed, hate, delusion,
or intoxication because they've got rid of these things, they don't
shake, tremble, quake, or get nervous, nor are they persuaded by the
teachings of other ascetics."

Thinking: 'Here the Realized One was born!'---that is an inspiring
place.

Thinking: 'Here the Realized One became awakened as a supreme fully
awakened Buddha!'---that is an inspiring place.

Thinking: 'Here the Realized One rolled forth the supreme Wheel of
Dhamma!'---that is an inspiring place.

Thinking: 'Here the Realized One was fully quenched in the element of
extinguishment, with no residue!'---that is an inspiring place.

### N 4.121 Guilt  *Attānuvādasutta* {#n-4.121-guilt-attānuvādasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, there are these four fears. What four? The fears of guilt,
shame, punishment, and going to a bad place.

And what, mendicants, is the fear of guilt? It's when someone reflects:
'If I were to do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind, wouldn't I
blame myself for my conduct?' Being afraid of guilt, they give up bad
conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by
way of body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure. This is called
the fear of guilt.

And what, mendicants, is the fear of shame? It's when someone reflects:
'If I were to do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind, wouldn't
others blame me for my conduct?' Being afraid of shame, they give up bad
conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by
way of body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure. This is called
the fear of shame.

And what, mendicants, is the fear of punishment? It's when someone sees
that the kings have arrested a bandit, a criminal, and subjected them to
various punishments---whipping, caning, and clubbing; cutting off hands
or feet, or both; cutting off ears or nose, or both; the 'porridge pot',
the 'shell-shave', the '[Rāhu]{lang="sa"}'s mouth', the 'garland of
fire', the 'burning hand', the 'bulrush twist', the 'bark dress', the
'antelope', the 'meat hook', the 'coins', the 'caustic pickle', the
'twisting bar', the 'straw mat'; being splashed with hot oil, being fed
to the dogs, being impaled alive, and being beheaded.

They think: 'If I were to do the same kind of bad deed, the kings would
punish me in the same way.' ... Being afraid of punishment, they don't
steal the belongings of others. They give up bad conduct by way of body,
speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and
mind, keeping themselves pure. This is called the fear of punishment.

And what, mendicants, is the fear of rebirth in a bad place? It's when
someone reflects: 'Bad conduct of body, speech, or mind has a bad result
in the next life. If I were to do such bad things, when my body breaks
up, after death, I'd be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the
underworld, hell.' Being afraid of rebirth in a bad place, they give up
bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct
by way of body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure. This is
called the fear of rebirth in a bad place.

These are the four fears."

### N 4.122 The Danger of Waves  *Ūmibhayasutta* {#n-4.122-the-danger-of-waves-ūmibhayasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, anyone who enters the water should anticipate four dangers.
What four? The dangers of waves, gharials, whirlpools, and sharks.

These are the four dangers that anyone who enters the water should
anticipate. In the same way, a gentleman gone forth from the lay life to
homelessness in this teaching and training should anticipate four
dangers. What four? The dangers of waves, gharials, whirlpools, and
sharks.

And what, mendicants, is the danger of waves? It's when a gentleman has
gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness, thinking:
'I'm swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation,
pain, sadness, and distress. I'm swamped by suffering, mired in
suffering. Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of
suffering.' When they've gone forth, their spiritual companions advise
and instruct them: 'You should go out like this, and come back like
that. You should look to the front like this, and to the side like that.
You should contract your limbs like this, and extend them like that.
This is how you should bear your outer robe, bowl, and robes.' They
think: 'Formerly, as laypeople, we advised and instructed others. And
now these mendicants---who you'd think were our children or
grandchildren---imagine they can advise and instruct us!' Angry and
upset, they resign the training and return to a lesser life. This is
called a mendicant who rejects the training and returns to a lesser life
for fear of the danger of waves. 'Danger of waves' is a term for anger
and distress. This is called the danger of waves.

And what, mendicants, is the danger of gharials? It's when a gentleman
has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness ... When
they've gone forth, their spiritual companions advise and instruct them:
'You may eat, consume, taste, and drink these things, but not those. You
may eat what's allowable, but not what's unallowable. You may eat at the
right time, but not at the wrong time.' They think: 'Formerly, as
laypeople, we used to eat, consume, taste, and drink what we wanted, not
what we didn't want. We ate and drank both allowable and unallowable
things, at the right time and the wrong time. And these faithful
householders give us delicious fresh and cooked foods at the wrong time
of day. But these guys imagine they can gag our mouths!' Angry and
upset, they resign the training and return to a lesser life. This is
called a mendicant who rejects the training and returns to a lesser life
for fear of the danger of gharials. 'Danger of gharials' is a term for
gluttony. This is called the danger of gharials.

And what, mendicants, is the danger of whirlpools? It's when a gentleman
has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness ... When
they've gone forth, they robe up in the morning and, taking their bowl
and robe, enter a village or town for alms without guarding body,
speech, and mind, without establishing mindfulness, and without
restraining the sense faculties. There they see a householder or their
child amusing themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of
sensual stimulation. They think: 'Formerly, as laypeople, we amused
ourselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual
stimulation. And it's true that my family is wealthy. I can both enjoy
my wealth and make merit. Why don't I resign the training and return to
a lesser life, so I can enjoy my wealth and make merit?' They resign the
training and return to a lesser life. This is called a mendicant who
rejects the training and returns to a lesser life for fear of the danger
of whirlpools. 'Danger of whirlpools' is a term for the five kinds of
sensual stimulation. This is called the danger of whirlpools.

And what, mendicants, is the danger of sharks? It's when a gentleman has
gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness ... When
they've gone forth, they robe up in the morning and, taking their bowl
and robe, enter a village or town for alms without guarding body,
speech, and mind, without establishing mindfulness, and without
restraining the sense faculties. There they see a female scantily clad,
with revealing clothes. Lust infects their mind, so they resign the
training and return to a lesser life. This is called a mendicant who
rejects the training and returns to a lesser life because they're afraid
of the danger of sharks. 'Danger of sharks' is a term for females. This
is called the danger of sharks.

These are the four dangers that a gentleman gone forth from the lay life
to homelessness in this teaching and training should anticipate."

keeping it connected. They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying.
If they abide in that, are committed to it, and meditate on it often

rejoicing ... equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the
third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across,
everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the
whole world---abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill
will. They contemplate the phenomena there---included in form, feeling,
perception, choices, and consciousness---as impermanent, as suffering,
as diseased, as a boil, as a dart, as misery, as an affliction, as
alien, as falling apart, as empty, as not-self. When their body breaks
up, after death, they're reborn in the company of the gods of the pure
abodes. This rebirth is not shared with ordinary people.

These are the four people found in the world."

"Mendicants, with the appearance of a Realized One, a perfected one, a
fully awakened Buddha, four incredible and amazing things appear. What
four?

When the being intent on awakening passes away from the host of joyful
gods, he's conceived in his mother's womb, mindful and aware. And
then---in this world with its gods, [Māras]{lang="sa"}, and divinities,
this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans---an
immeasurable, magnificent light appears, surpassing the glory of the
gods. Even in the boundless void of interstellar space---so utterly dark
that even the light of the moon and the sun, so mighty and powerful,
makes no impression---an immeasurable, magnificent light appears,
surpassing the glory of the gods. And the sentient beings reborn there
recognize each other by that light: 'So, it seems other sentient beings
have been reborn here!' This is the first incredible and amazing thing
that appears with the appearance of a Realized One.

Furthermore, the being intent on awakening emerges from his mother's
womb, mindful and aware. And then ... an immeasurable, magnificent light
appears ... even in the boundless void of interstellar space ... This is
the second incredible and amazing thing that appears with the appearance
of a Realized One.

Furthermore, the Realized One understands the supreme perfect awakening.
And then ... an immeasurable, magnificent light appears ... even in the
boundless void of interstellar space ... This is the third incredible
and amazing thing that appears with the appearance of a Realized One.

Furthermore, the Realized One rolls forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma.
And then ... an immeasurable, magnificent light appears ... even in the
boundless void of interstellar space ... This is the fourth incredible
and amazing thing that appears with the appearance of a Realized One.

With the appearance of a Realized One, the perfected one, the fully
awakened Buddha, these four incredible and amazing things appear."

People like clinging, they love it and enjoy it. Yet when a Realized One
is teaching the Dhamma of non-clinging, they want to listen, they
actively listen, and they try to understand. This is the first
incredible and amazing thing that appears with the appearance of a
Realized One.

People like conceit, they love it and enjoy it. Yet when a Realized One
is teaching the Dhamma of removing conceit, they want to listen, they
actively listen, and they try to understand. This is the second
incredible and amazing thing that appears with the appearance of a
Realized One.

People like excitement, they love it and enjoy it. Yet when a Realized
One is teaching the Dhamma of peace, they want to listen, they actively
listen, and they try to understand. This is the third incredible and
amazing thing that appears with the appearance of a Realized One.

This population is lost in ignorance, swaddled in their shells. Yet when

### N 4.157 Illness  *Rogasutta* {#n-4.157-illness-rogasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, there are two kinds of illness. What two? Mental and
physical. Some sentient beings are seen who can claim to be free of
physical illness for a year, or two, or three years ... even up to a
hundred years or more. But it's very hard to find any sentient beings in
the world who can claim to be free of mental illness even for an hour,
apart from those who have ended the defilements.

There are four kinds of illness for those gone forth. What four?

To start with, a mendicant has many wishes, is frustrated, and is not
content with any kind of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and
supplies for the sick.

Because of this, they focus their corrupt wishes on status, and on
getting material things, honor, and popularity.

They try hard, strive, and make an effort to get these things.

They have an ulterior motive when they visit families. They have an
ulterior motive when they sit down, when they speak on Dhamma, and even
when they hold it in when they need to go to the toilet.

These are the four kinds of illness for those gone forth.

So you should train like this: 'We will not have many wishes or be
frustrated. We will be content with any kind of robes, almsfood,
lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. We won't focus our
corrupt wishes on status, and on getting material things, honor, and
popularity. We won't try hard, strive, and make an effort to get these
things. We will endure cold, heat, hunger, and thirst. We will endure
the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles. We will endure
rude and unwelcome criticism. We will put up with physical pain---sharp,
severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, and life-threatening.' That's
how you should train."

### N 4.158 Decline  *Parihānisutta* {#n-4.158-decline-parihānisutta .unnumbered}

There [Sāriputta]{lang="sa"} addressed the mendicants: "Reverends,
mendicants!"

"Reverend," they replied. [Sāriputta]{lang="sa"} said this:

"Reverends, any monk or nun who sees four things inside themselves
should conclude: 'My skillful qualities are declining. For this is what
the Buddha calls decline.' What four? They have much greed, much hate,
and much delusion; and their wisdom eye doesn't go into the many deep
matters. Any monk or nun who sees these four things inside themselves
should conclude: 'My skillful qualities are declining. For this is what
the Buddha calls decline.'

Any monk or nun who sees four things inside themselves should conclude:
'My skillful qualities are not declining. For this is what the Buddha

nun who sees these four things inside themselves should conclude: 'My
skillful qualities are not declining. For this is what the Buddha calls
non-decline.'"

### N 4.159 Nun  *Bhikkhunīsutta* {#n-4.159-nun-bhikkhunīsutta .unnumbered}

[So I have heard.]{.smallcaps} At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying
near [Kosambī]{lang="sa"}, in Ghosita's Monastery.

And then a certain nun addressed a man, "Please, mister, go to Master
Ānanda, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him: 'Sir,
the nun named so-and-so is sick, suffering, and gravely ill. She bows
with her head to your feet.' And then say: 'Sir, please go to the nuns'
quarters to visit that nun out of sympathy.'"

"Yes, ma'am," that man replied. He did as the nun asked. Ānanda
consented with silence.

Then Ānanda robed up and went to the nuns' quarters to visit that nun,
taking his bowl and robe. That nun saw Ānanda coming off in the
distance. She wrapped herself up from head to foot and laid down on her
cot. Then Venerable Ānanda went up to her, and sat down on the seat
spread out. Then Ānanda said to the nun:

"Sister, this body is produced by food. Relying on food, you should give
up food. This body is produced by craving. Relying on craving, you
should give up craving. This body is produced by conceit. Relying on
conceit, you should give up conceit. This body is produced by sex. The
Buddha spoke of breaking off everything to do with sex.

'This body is produced by food. Relying on food, you should give up
food.' This is what I said, but why did I say it? Take a mendicant who
reflects rationally on the food that they eat: 'Not for fun, indulgence,
adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm,
and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to
old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will have the
means to keep going, blamelessness, and a comfortable abiding.' After
some time, relying on food, they give up food. That's why I said what I
said.

'This body is produced by craving. Relying on craving, you should give
up craving.' This is what I said, but why did I say it? Take a mendicant
who hears this: 'They say that the mendicant named so-and-so has
realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this
very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due
to the ending of defilements.' They think: 'Oh, when will I too realize
the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life.
...' After some time, relying on craving, they give up craving. That's
why I said what I said.

'This body is produced by conceit. Relying on conceit, you should give
up conceit.' This is what I said, but why did I say it? Take a mendicant
who hears this: 'They say that the mendicant named so-and-so has
realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this
very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due
to the ending of defilements.' They think: 'Well, that venerable can
realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this
very life. ... Why can't I?' After some time, relying on conceit, they
give up conceit. That's why I said what I said.

'This body is produced by sex. The Buddha spoke of breaking off
everything to do with sex.'"

Then that nun rose from her cot, placed her robe over one shoulder,
bowed with her head at Ānanda's feet, and said, "I have made a mistake,
sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to act in that way.
Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I can restrain myself
in future."

"Indeed, sister, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and
unskillful of you to act in that way. But since you have recognized your
mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it.
For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake
for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the
future."

### N 4.160 The Training of a Holy One  *Sugatavinayasutta* {#n-4.160-the-training-of-a-holy-one-sugatavinayasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, a Holy One or a Holy One's training remain in the world for
the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world,
for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.

And who is a Holy One? It's when a Realized One arises in the world,
perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and
conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to
train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. This is a Holy
One.

And what is the training of a Holy One? He proclaims a teaching that is
good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end,
meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that's
entirely full and pure. This is the training of a Holy One. This is how
a Holy One or a Holy One's training remain in the world for the welfare
and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the
benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.

These four things lead to the decline and disappearance of the true
teaching. What four?

Firstly, the mendicants memorize discourses that they learned
incorrectly, with misplaced words and phrases. When the words and
phrases are misplaced, the meaning is misinterpreted. This is the first
thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching.

Furthermore, the mendicants are hard to admonish, having qualities that
make them hard to admonish. They're impatient, and don't take
instruction respectfully. This is the second thing that leads to the
decline and disappearance of the true teaching.

Furthermore, the mendicants who are very learned---inheritors of the
heritage, who have memorized the teachings, the monastic law, and the
outlines---don't carefully make others recite the discourses. When they
pass away, the discourses are cut off at the root, with no-one to
preserve them. This is the third thing that leads to the decline and
disappearance of the true teaching.

Furthermore, the senior mendicants are indulgent and slack, leaders in
backsliding, neglecting seclusion, not rousing energy for attaining the
unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.
Those who come after them follow their example. They too become
indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion, not
rousing energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved,
and realizing the unrealized. This is the fourth thing that leads to the
decline and disappearance of the true teaching.

These are four things that lead to the decline and disappearance of the
true teaching.

These four things lead to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of
the true teaching. What four?

Firstly, the mendicants memorize discourses that have been learned
correctly, with well placed words and phrases. When the words and
phrases are well placed, the meaning is interpreted correctly. This is
the first thing that leads to the continuation, persistence, and
enduring of the true teaching.

Furthermore, the mendicants are easy to admonish, having qualities that
make them easy to admonish. They're patient, and take instruction
respectfully. This is the second thing that leads to the continuation,
persistence, and enduring of the true teaching.

Furthermore, the mendicants who are very learned---inheritors of the
heritage, who have memorized the teachings, the monastic law, and the
outlines---carefully make others recite the discourses. When they pass
away, the discourses aren't cut off at the root, and they have someone
to preserve them. This is the third thing that leads to the
continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching.

Furthermore, the senior mendicants are not indulgent or slack, nor are
they backsliders; instead, they take the lead in seclusion, rousing
energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and
realizing the unrealized. Those who come after them follow their
example. They too aren't indulgent or slack ... This is the fourth thing
that leads to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true
teaching.

These are four things that lead to the continuation, persistence, and
enduring of the true teaching."

1.  Painful practice with slow insight,

2.  painful practice with swift insight,

3.  pleasant practice with slow insight, and

4.  pleasant practice with swift insight.

And what's the painful practice with slow insight? It's when someone is
ordinarily full of acute greed, hate, and delusion. They often feel the
pain and sadness that greed, hate, and delusion bring. These five
faculties manifest in them weakly: faith, energy, mindfulness,
immersion, and wisdom. Because of this, they only slowly attain the
conditions for ending the defilements in the present life. This is
called the painful practice with slow insight.

And what's the painful practice with swift insight? It's when someone is

1.  Painful practice with slow insight,

2.  painful practice with swift insight,

3.  pleasant practice with slow insight, and

4.  pleasant practice with swift insight.

And what's the painful practice with slow insight? It's when a mendicant
meditates observing the ugliness of the body, perceives the
repulsiveness of food, perceives dissatisfaction with the whole world,
observes the impermanence of all conditions, and has well established
the perception of their own death. They rely on these five powers of a
trainee: faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom. But these five
faculties manifest in them weakly: faith, energy, mindfulness,
immersion, and wisdom. Because of this, they only slowly attain the
conditions for ending the defilements in the present life. This is

immersion, and wisdom. Because of this, they swiftly attain the
conditions for ending the defilements in the present life. This is
called the painful practice with swift insight.

And what's the pleasant practice with slow insight? It's when a
mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which
has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and
keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and keeping it
connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption,
which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity
and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And
with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third
absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware,
personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare,
'Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.' Giving up pleasure and
pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in
the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity
and mindfulness. They rely on these five powers of a trainee: faith,
conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom. But these five faculties
manifest in them weakly: faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and
wisdom. Because of this, they only slowly attain the conditions for
ending the defilements in the present life. This is called the pleasant
practice with slow insight.

And what's the pleasant practice with swift insight? It's when a
mendicant ... enters and remains in the first absorption ... second

### N 4.164 Patient (1st)  *Paṭhamakhamasutta* {#n-4.164-patient-1st-paṭhamakhamasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, there are four ways of practice. What four? Impatient
practice, patient practice, taming practice, and calming practice.

And what's the impatient practice? It's when someone abuses, annoys, or
argues with you, and you abuse, annoy, or argue right back at them. This
is called the impatient practice.

And what's the patient practice? It's when someone abuses, annoys, or
argues with you, and you don't abuse, annoy, or argue back at them. This
is called the patient practice.

And what's the taming practice? When a mendicant sees a sight with their
eyes, they don't get caught up in the features and details. If the
faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of
covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason,
they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving
restraint over it. When they hear a sound with their ears ... When they
smell an odor with their nose ... When they taste a flavor with their
tongue ... When they feel a touch with their body ... When they know an
idea with their mind, they don't get caught up in the features and
details. If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful
qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For
this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind,
and achieving restraint over it. This is called the taming practice.

And what's the calming practice? It's when a mendicant doesn't tolerate
a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought. They don't tolerate any bad,
unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give them up, get rid of
them, calm them, eliminate them, and obliterate them. This is called the
calming practice.

These are the four ways of practice."

heat, hunger, and thirst. They cannot endure the touch of flies,
mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles. They cannot endure rude and
unwelcome criticism. And they cannot put up with physical pain---sharp,
severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, and life-threatening. This is
called the impatient practice.

### N 4.169 Extra Effort  *Sasaṅkhārasutta* {#n-4.169-extra-effort-sasaṅkhārasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, these four people are found in the world. What four?

1.  One person is fully extinguished in this very life by making extra

2.  One person is fully extinguished when the body breaks up by making
    extra effort.

3.  One person is fully extinguished in this very life without making
    extra effort.

4.  One person is fully extinguished when the body breaks up without

And how is a person fully extinguished in this very life by making extra
effort? It's when a mendicant meditates observing the ugliness of the
body, perceives the repulsiveness of food, perceives dissatisfaction
with the whole world, observes the impermanence of all conditions, and
has well established the perception of their own death. They rely on
these five powers of a trainee: faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and
wisdom. And these five faculties manifest in them strongly: faith,
energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. Because of the strength of
the five faculties, they are fully extinguished in this very life by
making extra effort. That's how a person is fully extinguished in this
very life by making extra effort.

### N 4.170 In Conjunction  *Yuganaddhasutta* {#n-4.170-in-conjunction-yuganaddhasutta .unnumbered}

[So I have heard.]{.smallcaps} At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying
near [Kosambī]{lang="sa"}, in Ghosita's Monastery. There Ānanda
addressed the mendicants: "Reverends, mendicants!"

"Reverend," they replied. Ānanda said this:

"Reverends, all of the monks and nuns who declare in my presence that
they have attained perfection, did so by one or other of four paths.

What four?

Take a mendicant who develops serenity before discernment. As they do
so, the path is born in them. They cultivate, develop, and make much of
it. By doing so, they give up the fetters and eliminate the underlying
tendencies.

Another mendicant develops discernment before serenity. As they do so,
the path is born in them. They cultivate, develop, and make much of it.
By doing so, they give up the fetters and eliminate the underlying
tendencies.

Another mendicant develops serenity and discernment in conjunction. As
they do so, the path is born in them. They cultivate, develop, and make
much of it. By doing so, they give up the fetters and eliminate the
underlying tendencies.

Another mendicant's mind is seized by restlessness to realize the
teaching. But there comes a time when their mind is stilled internally;
it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in [samādhi]{lang="sa"}. The
path is born in them. They cultivate, develop, and make much of it. By
doing so, they give up the fetters and eliminate the underlying
tendencies.

All of the monks and nuns who declare in my presence that they have
attained perfection, did so by one or other of these four paths."

## The Chapter on Intention  {#the-chapter-on-intention .unnumbered}

### N 4.171 Intention  *Cetanāsutta* {#n-4.171-intention-cetanāsutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, as long as there's a body, the intention that gives rise to
bodily action causes pleasure and pain to arise in oneself. As long as
there's a voice, the intention that gives rise to verbal action causes
pleasure and pain to arise in oneself. As long as there's a mind, the
intention that gives rise to mental action causes pleasure and pain to
arise in oneself. But these only apply when conditioned by ignorance.

By oneself one makes the choice that gives rise to bodily, verbal, and
mental action, conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in
oneself. Or else others make the choice ... One consciously makes the
choice ... Or else one unconsciously makes the choice ...

Ignorance is included in all these things. But when ignorance fades away
and ceases with nothing left over, there is no body and no voice and no
mind, conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in oneself.
There is no field, no ground, no scope, and no basis, conditioned by
which that pleasure and pain arise in oneself.

Mendicants, there are four kinds of reincarnation in a life-form. What
four?

1.  There is reincarnation in a life-form where one's own intention is
    effective, not that of others.

2.  There is reincarnation in a life-form where the intention of others
    is effective, not one's own.

3.  There is reincarnation in a life-form where both one's own and
    others' intentions are effective.

4.  There is reincarnation in a life-form where neither one's own nor
    others' intentions are effective.

These are the four kinds of reincarnation in a life-form."

When he said this, Venerable [Sāriputta]{lang="sa"} said to the Buddha:

"Sir, this is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha's
brief statement. Take the case of the reincarnation in a life-form where
one's own intention is effective, not that of others. Those sentient
beings pass away from that realm due to their own intention. Take the
case of the reincarnation in a life-form where the intention of others
is effective, not one's own. Those sentient beings pass away from that
realm due to the intention of others. Take the case of the reincarnation
in a life-form where both one's own and others' intentions are
effective. Those sentient beings pass away from that realm due to both
their own and others' intentions. But sir, in the case of the
reincarnation in a life-form where neither one's own nor others'
intentions are effective, what kind of gods does this refer to?"

"[Sāriputta]{lang="sa"}, it refers to the gods reborn in the dimension
of neither perception nor non-perception."

"What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why some sentient beings
pass away from that realm as returners who come back to this place,
while others are non-returners who don't come back?"

"[Sāriputta]{lang="sa"}, take a person who hasn't given up the lower
fetters. In this very life they enter and abide in the dimension of
neither perception nor non-perception. They enjoy it and like it and
find it satisfying. If they abide in that, are committed to it, and
meditate on it often without losing it, when they die they're reborn in
the company of the gods of the dimension of neither perception nor
non-perception. When they pass away from there, they're a returner, who
comes back to this place.

There [Sāriputta]{lang="sa"} addressed the mendicants: "Reverends,
mendicants!"

"Reverend," they replied. [Sāriputta]{lang="sa"} said this:

"Reverends, I realized the textual analysis of the meaning---piece by
piece and expression by expression---a fortnight after I ordained. In

sat down to one side, and said to [Sāriputta]{lang="sa"}:

"Reverend, when the six fields of contact have faded away and ceased
with nothing left over, does something else still exist?"

"Don't put it like that, reverend."

"Does something else no longer exist?"

"Don't put it like that, reverend."

"Does something else both still exist and no longer exist?"

"Don't put it like that, reverend."

"Does something else neither still exist nor no longer exist?"

"Don't put it like that, reverend."

"If you say that, 'When the six fields of contact have faded away and

[Sāriputta]{lang="sa"}, and exchanged greetings with him. When the

conduct. Reverend, someone lacking good conduct does not know and see
things as they are. Someone accomplished in good conduct knows and sees
things as they are. Knowing and seeing things as they are, one is a
terminator."

### N 4.176 Aspiration  *Āyācanasutta* {#n-4.176-aspiration-āyācanasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, a faithful monk would rightly aspire: 'May I be like
[Sāriputta]{lang="sa"} and [Moggallāna]{lang="sa"}!' These are a
standard and a measure for my monk disciples, that is,
[Sāriputta]{lang="sa"} and [Moggallāna]{lang="sa"}.

A faithful nun would rightly aspire: 'May I be like the nuns
[Khemā]{lang="sa"} and [Uppalavaṇṇā]{lang="sa"}!' These are a standard
and a measure for my nun disciples, that is, the nuns [Khemā]{lang="sa"}
and [Uppalavaṇṇā]{lang="sa"}.

A faithful layman would rightly aspire: 'May I be like the householder
Citta and Hatthaka of [Ãḷavī]{lang="sa"}!' These are a standard and a
measure for my male lay disciples, that is, the householder Citta and
Hatthaka of [Ãḷavī]{lang="sa"}.

A faithful laywoman would rightly aspire: 'May I be like the laywomen
[Khujjuttarā]{lang="sa"} and [Veḷukaṇṭakī]{lang="sa"}, Nanda's mother!'
These are a standard and a measure for my female lay disciples, that is,
the laywomen [Khujjuttarā]{lang="sa"} and [Veḷukaṇṭakī]{lang="sa"},
Nanda's mother."

### N 4.177 With Rāhula  *Rāhulasutta* {#n-4.177-with-rāhula-rāhulasutta .unnumbered}

Then Venerable [Rāhula]{lang="sa"} went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat
down to one side. The Buddha said to him:

"[Rāhula]{lang="sa"}, the interior earth element and the exterior earth
element are just the earth element. This should be truly seen with right
understanding like this: 'This is not mine, I am not this, this is not
my self.' When you truly see with right understanding, you grow
disillusioned with the earth element, detaching the mind from the earth
element.

The interior water element and the exterior water element are just the
water element. This should be truly seen with right understanding like
this: 'This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.' When you
truly see with right understanding, you grow disillusioned with the
water element, detaching the mind from the water element.

The interior fire element and the exterior fire element are just the
fire element. This should be truly seen with right understanding like
this: 'This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.' When you
truly see with right understanding, you grow disillusioned with the fire
element, detaching the mind from the fire element.

The interior air element and the exterior air element are just the air
element. This should be truly seen with right understanding like this:
'This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.' When you truly
see with right understanding, you grow disillusioned with the air
element, detaching the mind from the air element.

When a mendicant sees these four elements as neither self nor belonging
to self, they're called a mendicant who has cut off craving, untied the
fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit has made an end of
suffering."

### N 4.178 Billabong  *Jambālīsutta* {#n-4.178-billabong-jambālīsutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, these four people are found in the world. What four?

Take a mendicant who enters and remains in a peaceful release of the
heart. They focus on the cessation of substantial reality, but on that
their mind does not leap forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become
decided. You wouldn't expect that mendicant to realize the cessation of
substantial reality. Suppose a person were to grab a branch with a
glue-smeared hand. Their hand would stick, hold, and bind to it. In the
same way, take a mendicant who enters and remains in a peaceful release
of the heart. They focus on the cessation of substantial reality, but on
that their mind does not leap forth, gain confidence, settle down, and
become decided. You wouldn't expect that mendicant to realize the
cessation of substantial reality.

Next, take a mendicant who enters and remains in a peaceful release of
the heart. They focus on the cessation of substantial reality, and on
that their mind leaps forth, gains confidence, settles down, and becomes
decided. You would expect that mendicant to realize the cessation of
substantial reality. Suppose a person were to grab a branch with a clean
hand. Their hand wouldn't stick, hold, or bind to it. In the same way,
take a mendicant who enters and remains in a peaceful release of the
heart. They focus on the cessation of substantial reality, and on that
their mind leaps forth, gains confidence, settles down, and becomes
decided. You would expect that mendicant to realize the cessation of
substantial reality.

Next, take a mendicant who enters and remains in a peaceful release of
the heart. They focus on smashing ignorance, but on that their mind does
not leap forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become decided. You
wouldn't expect that mendicant to smash ignorance. Suppose there was a
billabong that had been stagnant for many years. And someone was to
close off the inlets and open up the drains, and the heavens didn't
provide enough rain. You wouldn't expect that billabong to break its
banks. In the same way, take a mendicant who enters and remains in a
certain peaceful release of the heart. They focus on smashing ignorance,
but on that their mind does not leap forth, gain confidence, settle
down, and become decided. You wouldn't expect that mendicant to smash
ignorance.

Next, take a mendicant who enters and remains in a peaceful release of
the heart. They focus on smashing ignorance, and on that their mind

would expect that mendicant to smash ignorance. Suppose there was a
billabong that had been stagnant for many years. And someone was to open
up the inlets and close off the drains, and the heavens provided plenty
of rain. You would expect that billabong to break its banks. In the same
way, take a mendicant who enters and remains in a certain peaceful
release of the heart. They focus on smashing ignorance, and on that

These are the four people found in the world."

### N 4.179 Extinguishment  *Nibbānasutta* {#n-4.179-extinguishment-nibbānasutta .unnumbered}

Then Venerable Ānanda went up to Venerable [Sāriputta]{lang="sa"}, and
exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation
were over, Ānanda sat down to one side, and said to
[Sāriputta]{lang="sa"}:

"What is the cause, Reverend [Sāriputta]{lang="sa"}, what is the reason
why some sentient beings are not fully extinguished in this very life?"

"Reverend Ānanda, it's because some sentient beings don't really
understand which perceptions make things worse, which keep things
steady, which lead to distinction, and which lead to penetration. That's
the cause, that's the reason why some sentient beings are not fully
extinguished in this very life."

"What is the cause, Reverend [Sāriputta]{lang="sa"}, what is the reason
why some sentient beings are fully extinguished in this very life?"

"Reverend Ānanda, it's because some sentient beings truly understand
which perceptions make things worse, which keep things steady, which

this very life."

### N 4.180 The Four Great References  *Mahāpadesasutta* {#n-4.180-the-four-great-references-mahāpadesasutta .unnumbered}

At one time the Buddha was staying near the city of Bhoga, at the Ānanda
Tree-shrine.

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied.

The Buddha said this: "Mendicants, I will teach you the four great
references. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, what are the four great references?

Take a mendicant who says: 'Reverend, I have heard and learned this in
the presence of the Buddha: this is the teaching, this is the training,
this is the Teacher's instruction.' You should neither approve nor
dismiss that mendicant's statement. Instead, having carefully memorized
those words and phrases, you should make sure they fit in the discourse
and are exhibited in the training. If they do not fit in the discourse
and are not exhibited in the training, you should draw the conclusion:
'Clearly this is not the word of the Blessed One, the perfected one, the
fully awakened Buddha. It has been incorrectly memorized by that
mendicant.' And so you should reject it.

Take another mendicant who says: 'Reverend, I have heard and learned
this in the presence of the Buddha: this is the teaching, this is the
training, this is the Teacher's instruction.' You should neither approve
nor dismiss that mendicant's statement. Instead, having carefully
memorized those words and phrases, you should make sure they fit in the
discourse and are exhibited in the training. If they fit in the
discourse and are exhibited in the training, you should draw the
conclusion: 'Clearly this is the word of the Blessed One, the perfected
one, the fully awakened Buddha. It has been correctly memorized by that
mendicant.' You should remember it. This is the first great reference.

Take another mendicant who says: 'In such-and-such monastery lives a
[Saṅgha]{lang="sa"} with seniors and leaders. I've heard and learned
this in the presence of that [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"}: this is the teaching,
this is the training, this is the Teacher's instruction.' You should
neither approve nor dismiss that mendicant's statement. Instead, having
carefully memorized those words and phrases, you should make sure they
fit in the discourse and are exhibited in the training. If they do not
fit in the discourse and are not exhibited in the training, you should
draw the conclusion: 'Clearly this is not the word of the Blessed One,
the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. It has been incorrectly
memorized by that [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"}.' And so you should reject it.

Take another mendicant who says: 'In such-and-such monastery lives a
[Saṅgha]{lang="sa"} with seniors and leaders. I've heard and learned
this in the presence of that [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"}: this is the teaching,
this is the training, this is the Teacher's instruction.' You should
neither approve nor dismiss that mendicant's statement. Instead, having

conclusion: 'Clearly this is the word of the Blessed One, the perfected
one, the fully awakened Buddha. It has been correctly memorized by that
[Saṅgha]{lang="sa"}.' You should remember it. This is the second great
reference.

Take another mendicant who says: 'In such-and-such monastery there are
several senior mendicants who are very learned, inheritors of the
heritage, who remember the teachings, the monastic law, and the
outlines. I've heard and learned this in the presence of those senior
mendicants: this is the teaching, this is the training, this is the
Teacher's instruction.' You should neither approve nor dismiss that
mendicant's statement. Instead, having carefully memorized those words
and phrases, you should make sure they fit in the discourse and are
exhibited in the training. If they do not fit in the discourse and are
not exhibited in the training, you should draw the conclusion: 'Clearly
this is not the word of the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully
awakened Buddha. It has been incorrectly memorized by those senior
mendicants.' And so you should reject it.

Take another mendicant who says: 'In such-and-such monastery there are
several senior mendicants who are very learned, inheritors of the
heritage, who remember the teachings, the monastic law, and the
outlines. I've heard and learned this in the presence of those senior

exhibited in the training, you should draw the conclusion: 'Clearly this
is the word of the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened
Buddha. It has been correctly memorized by those senior mendicants.' You
should remember it. This is the third great reference.

Take another mendicant who says: 'In such-and-such monastery there is a
single senior mendicant who is very learned, an inheritor of the
heritage, who has memorized the teachings, the monastic law, and the
outlines. I've heard and learned this in the presence of that senior
mendicant: this is the teaching, this is the training, this is the
Teacher's instruction.' You should neither approve nor dismiss that
mendicant's statement. Instead, having carefully memorized those words
and phrases, you should make sure they fit in the discourse and are
exhibited in the training. If they do not fit in the discourse and are
not exhibited in the training, you should draw the conclusion: 'Clearly
this is not the word of the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully
awakened Buddha. It has been incorrectly memorized by that senior
mendicant.' And so you should reject it.

These are the four great references."

## The Chapter on Brahmins  {#the-chapter-on-brahmins .unnumbered}

### N 4.181 A Warrior  *Yodhājīvasutta* {#n-4.181-a-warrior-yodhājīvasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, a warrior with four factors is worthy of a king, fit to
serve a king, and is considered a factor of kingship. What four? He's
skilled in the basics, a long-distance shooter, a marksman, one who
shatters large objects. A warrior with these four factors is worthy of a
king, fit to serve a king, and is considered a factor of kingship.

In the same way, a mendicant with four qualities is worthy of offerings
dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious
donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme
field of merit for the world. What four? He's skilled in the basics, a
long-distance shooter, a marksman, one who shatters large objects.

And how is a mendicant skilled in the basics? It's when a mendicant is
ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and
resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest
fault, they keep the rules they've undertaken. That's how a mendicant is
skilled in the basics.

And how is a mendicant a long-distance shooter? It's when a mendicant
truly sees any kind of form at all---past, future, or present; internal
or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: *all*
form---with right understanding: 'This is not mine, I am not this, this
is not my self.' They truly see any kind of feeling ... perception ...
choices ... consciousness at all---past, future, or present; internal or
external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near, *all*
consciousness---with right understanding: 'This is not mine, I am not
this, this is not my self.' That's how a mendicant is a long-distance
shooter.

And how is a mendicant a marksman? It's when they truly understand:
'This is suffering' ... 'This is the origin of suffering' ... 'This is
the cessation of suffering' ... 'This is the practice that leads to the
cessation of suffering'. That's how a mendicant is a marksman.

And how does a mendicant shatter large objects? It's when a mendicant
shatters the great mass of ignorance. That's how a mendicant shatters
large objects.

A mendicant with these four qualities ... is the supreme field of merit
for the world."

### N 4.182 Guarantee  *Pāṭibhogasutta* {#n-4.182-guarantee-pāṭibhogasutta .unnumbered}

"There are four things that no-one can guarantee---not an ascetic, a
brahmin, a god, a [Māra]{lang="sa"}, a divinity, or anyone in the world.

What four? No-one can guarantee that someone liable to old age will not
grow old. No-one can guarantee that someone liable to sickness will not
get sick. No-one can guarantee that someone liable to death will not
die. No-one can guarantee that the bad deeds done in past
lives---corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in
suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death---will not produce
their result.

These are the four things that no-one can guarantee---not an ascetic, a
brahmin, a god, a [Māra]{lang="sa"}, a divinity, or anyone in the
world."

### N 4.183 Vassakāra on What is Heard  *Sutasutta* {#n-4.183-vassakāra-on-what-is-heard-sutasutta .unnumbered}

At one time the Buddha was staying near [Rājagaha]{lang="sa"}, in the
Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding ground. Then [Vassakāra]{lang="sa"}
the brahmin, a chief minister of Magadha, went up to the Buddha, and
exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation
were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:

"Mister Gotama, this is my doctrine and view: There's nothing wrong with
talking about what you've seen, saying: 'So I have seen.' There's
nothing wrong with talking about what you've heard, saying: 'So I have
heard.' There's nothing wrong with talking about what you've thought,
saying: 'So I have thought.' There's nothing wrong with talking about
what you've known, saying: 'So I have known.'"

"Brahmin, I don't say you should talk about everything you see, hear,
think, and know. But I also don't say you should talk about nothing you
see, hear, think, and know.

When talking about certain things you've seen, heard, thought, or known,
unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline. I say that
you shouldn't talk about those things. When talking about other things
you've seen, heard, thought, or known, unskillful qualities decline
while skillful qualities grow. I say that you should talk about those
things."

Then [Vassakāra]{lang="sa"} the brahmin, having approved and agreed with
what the Buddha said, got up from his seat and left.

### N 4.184 Fearless  *Abhayasutta* {#n-4.184-fearless-abhayasutta .unnumbered}

Then the brahmin [Jānussoṇi]{lang="sa"} went up to the Buddha, and
exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation
were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:

"Mister Gotama, this is my doctrine and view: 'All those liable to death
are frightened and terrified of death.'"

"Brahmin, some of those liable to death are frightened and terrified of
death. But some of those liable to death are not frightened and
terrified of death.

Who are those frightened of death? It's someone who isn't free of greed,
desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for sensual pleasures.
When they fall seriously ill, they think: 'The sensual pleasures that I
love so much will leave me, and I'll leave them.' They sorrow and wail
and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion. This is
someone who is frightened of death.

Furthermore, it's someone who isn't free of greed, desire, fondness,
thirst, passion, and craving for the body. When they fall seriously ill,
they think: 'This body that I love so much will leave me, and I'll leave
it.' They sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling
into confusion. This, too, is someone who is frightened of death.

Furthermore, it's someone who hasn't done good and skillful things that
keep them safe, but has done bad things, violence and sin. When they
fall seriously ill, they think: 'Well, I haven't done good and skillful
things that keep me safe. And I have done bad things, violence and sin.
When I depart, I'll go to the place where people who've done such things
go.' They sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling
into confusion. This, too, is someone who is frightened of death.

Furthermore, it's someone who's doubtful, uncertain, and undecided about
the true teaching. When they fall seriously ill, they think: 'I'm
doubtful, uncertain, and undecided about the true teaching.' They sorrow
and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
This, too, is someone who is frightened of death. These are the four
people liable to death who are frightened and terrified of death.

Who are those not frightened of death?

It's someone who is rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and
craving for sensual pleasures. When they fall seriously ill, they don't
think: 'The sensual pleasures that I love so much will leave me, and
I'll leave them.' They don't sorrow and wail and lament, beating their
breast and falling into confusion. This is someone who's not frightened
of death.

Furthermore, it's someone who is rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst,
passion, and craving for the body. When they fall seriously ill, they
don't think: 'This body that I love so much will leave me, and I'll
leave it.' They don't sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast
and falling into confusion. This, too, is someone who's not frightened
of death.

Furthermore, it's someone who hasn't done bad things, violence and sin,
but has done good and skillful deeds that keep them safe. When they fall
seriously ill, they think: 'Well, I haven't done bad things, violence
and sin. And I have done good and skillful deeds that keep me safe. When
I depart, I'll go to the place where people who've done such things go.'
They don't sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling
into confusion. This, too, is someone who's not frightened of death.

Furthermore, it's someone who's not doubtful, uncertain, or undecided
about the true teaching. When they fall seriously ill, they think: 'I'm
not doubtful, uncertain, or undecided about the true teaching.' They
don't sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into
confusion. This, too, is someone who's not frightened of death.

These are the four people liable to death who are not frightened and
terrified of death."

"Excellent, Mister Gotama! ... From this day forth, may Mister Gotama
remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."

### N 4.185 Truths of the Brahmins  *Brāhmaṇasaccasutta* {#n-4.185-truths-of-the-brahmins-brāhmaṇasaccasutta .unnumbered}

Once the Buddha was staying near [Rājagaha]{lang="sa"}, on the Vulture's
Peak Mountain.

Now at that time several very well-known wanderers were residing in the
monastery of the wanderers on the bank of the [Sappinī]{lang="sa"}
river. They included [Annabhāra]{lang="sa"}, Varadhara,
[Sakuludāyī]{lang="sa"}, and other very well-known wanderers.

Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to
the wanderer's monastery on the bank of the [Sappinī]{lang="sa"} river.

Now at that time this discussion came up while those wanderers of other
religions were sitting together, "The truths of the brahmins are like
this; the truths of the brahmins are like that."

Then the Buddha went up to those wanderers, sat down on the seat spread
out, and said to them, "Wanderers, what were you sitting talking about
just now? What conversation was left unfinished?"

"Well, Mister Gotama, this discussion came up among us while we were
sitting together: 'The truths of the brahmins are like this; the truths
of the brahmins are like that.'"

"Wanderers, I declare these four truths of the brahmins, having realized
them with my own insight. What four?

Take a brahmin who says: 'No sentient beings should be killed.' Saying
this, a brahmin speaks the truth, not lies. But they don't think of
themselves as an 'ascetic' or 'brahmin' because of that. Nor do they
think 'I'm better' or 'I'm equal' or 'I'm worse'. Rather, they simply
practice out of kindness and sympathy for living creatures, having had
insight into the truth of that.

Take another brahmin who says: 'All sensual pleasures are impermanent,
suffering, and perishable.' Saying this, a brahmin speaks the truth, not
lies. But they don't think of themselves as an 'ascetic' or 'brahmin'
because of that. Nor do they think 'I'm better' or 'I'm equal' or 'I'm
worse'. Rather, they simply practice for disillusionment, dispassion,
and cessation regarding sensual pleasures, having had insight into the
truth of that.

Take another brahmin who says: 'All states of existence are impermanent,
suffering, and perishable.' ... They simply practice for
disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding future lives,
having had insight into the truth of that.

Take another brahmin who says: 'I don't belong to anyone anywhere. And
nothing belongs to me anywhere.' Saying this, a brahmin speaks the
truth, not lies. But they don't think of themselves as an 'ascetic' or
'brahmin' because of that. Nor do they think 'I'm better' or 'I'm equal'
or 'I'm worse'. Rather, they simply practice the path of nothingness,
having had insight into the truth of that.

These are the four truths of the brahmins that I declare, having
realized them with my own insight."

### N 4.186 Approach  *Ummaggasutta* {#n-4.186-approach-ummaggasutta .unnumbered}

Then one of the mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to him:

"Sir, what leads the world on? What drags it around? What arises and
takes control?"

"Good, good, mendicant! Your approach and articulation are excellent,
and it's a good question. For you asked: 'What leads the world on? What
drags it around? What arises and takes control?'"

"Yes, sir."

"Mendicant, the mind leads the world on. The mind drags it around. When
the mind arises, it takes control."

Saying "Good, sir", that mendicant approved and agreed with what the
Buddha said. Then he asked another question:

"Sir, they speak of 'a learned memorizer of the teaching'. How is a
learned memorizer of the teaching defined?"

"Good, good, mendicant! Your approach and articulation are excellent,
and it's a good question. ... I have taught many teachings: statements,
mixed prose & verse, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations,
legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and elaborations. But
if anyone understands the meaning and the text of even a four-line
verse, and if they practice in line with that teaching, they're
qualified to be called a 'learned memorizer of the teaching'."

Saying "Good, sir", that mendicant approved and agreed with what the
Buddha said. Then he asked another question:

"Sir, they speak of 'a learned person with penetrating wisdom'. How is a
learned person with penetrating wisdom defined?"

"Good, good, mendicant! Your approach and articulation are excellent,
and it's a good question. ... Take a mendicant who has heard: 'This is
suffering.' They see what it means with penetrating wisdom. They've
heard: 'This is the origin of suffering' ... 'This is the cessation of
suffering' ... 'This is the practice that leads to the cessation of
suffering.' They see what it means with penetrating wisdom. That's how a
person is learned, with penetrating wisdom."

Saying "Good, sir", that mendicant approved and agreed with what the
Buddha said. Then he asked another question:

"Sir, they speak of 'an astute person with great wisdom'. How is an
astute person with great wisdom defined?"

"Good, good, mendicant! Your approach and articulation are excellent,
and it's a good question. ... An astute person with great wisdom is one
who has no intention to hurt themselves, or to hurt others, or to hurt
both. When they think, they only think of the benefit for themselves,
for others, for both, and for the whole world. That's how a person is
astute, with great wisdom."

### N 4.187 With Vassakāra  *Vassakārasutta* {#n-4.187-with-vassakāra-vassakārasutta .unnumbered}

At one time the Buddha was staying near [Rājagaha]{lang="sa"}, in the
Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding ground.

Then [Vassakāra]{lang="sa"} the brahmin, a chief chief minister of
Magadha, went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When
the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side
and said to the Buddha:

"Mister Gotama, could an untrue person know of an untrue person: 'This
fellow is an untrue person'?"

"That's impossible, brahmin, it can't happen."

"Could an untrue person know of a true person: 'This fellow is a true
person'?"

"That too is impossible, it can't happen."

"Mister Gotama, could a true person know of a true person: 'This fellow
is a true person'?"

"That, brahmin, is possible."

"Could a true person know of an untrue person: 'This fellow is an untrue
person'?"

"That too is possible."

"It's incredible, Mister Gotama, it's amazing, how well said this was by
Mister Gotama: 'It's impossible, it can't happen, that an untrue person
could know ... But it is possible that a true person could know ...'

Once, members of the brahmin Todeyya's assembly were going on
complaining about others: 'This King [Eḷeyya]{lang="sa"} is a fool to be
so devoted to the ascetic [Rāmaputta]{lang="sa"}. He even shows him the
utmost deference by bowing down to him, rising up for him, greeting him
with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette for him. And these
king's men are fools too---Yamaka, Moggalla, Ugga,
[Nāvindakī]{lang="sa"}, Gandhabba, and Aggivessa---for they show the
same kind of deference to [Rāmaputta]{lang="sa"}.' Then the brahmin
Todeyya reasoned with them like this: 'What do the good sirs think? When
it comes to the various duties and speeches, isn't King
[Eḷeyya]{lang="sa"} astute, even better than the experts?' 'That's true,
sir.'

'It's because the ascetic [Rāmaputta]{lang="sa"} is even more astute and
expert than King [Eḷeyya]{lang="sa"} that the king is so devoted to him.
That's why he even shows [Rāmaputta]{lang="sa"} the utmost deference by
bowing down to him, rising up for him, greeting him with joined palms,
and observing proper etiquette for him.

'What do the good sirs think? When it comes to the various duties and
speeches, aren't the king's men---Yamaka, Moggalla, Ugga,
[Nāvindakī]{lang="sa"}, Gandhabba, and Aggivessa---astute, even better
than the experts?' 'That's true, sir.'

'It's because [Rāmaputta]{lang="sa"} is even more astute and expert than
the king's men that they have such devotion to him. ... It's because
[Rāmaputta]{lang="sa"} is even more astute and expert than King
[Eḷeyya]{lang="sa"} that the king is so devoted to him. That's why he
even shows [Rāmaputta]{lang="sa"} the utmost deference by bowing down to
him, rising up for him, greeting him with joined palms, and observing
proper etiquette for him.'

It's incredible, Mister Gotama, it's amazing, how well said this was by
Mister Gotama: 'It's impossible, it can't happen, that an untrue person
could know ... But it is possible that a true person could know ...
Well, now, Mister Gotama, I must go. I have many duties, and much to
do."

"Please, brahmin, go at your convenience."

Then [Vassakāra]{lang="sa"} the brahmin, having approved and agreed with
what the Buddha said, got up from his seat and left.

### N 4.188 With Upaka  *Upakasutta* {#n-4.188-with-upaka-upakasutta .unnumbered}

Once the Buddha was staying near [Rājagaha]{lang="sa"}, on the Vulture's
Peak Mountain. Then Upaka the son of [Maṇḍikā]{lang="sa"} went up to the
Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, this is my doctrine and view: 'Whoever goes on complaining about
others without giving any reasons is reprehensible and at fault.'"

"Upaka, if someone goes on complaining about others without giving a
reason, they're reprehensible and at fault. But that's what you do, so
you're reprehensible and at fault!"

"Sir, like a fish caught in a big trap just as it rises, so the Buddha
caught me in a big trap of words just as I rose up."

"Upaka, I've declared: 'This is unskillful.' And there are limitless
words, phrases, and teachings of the Realized One about that: 'This is
another way of saying that this is unskillful.' I've declared: 'The
unskillful should be given up.' And there are limitless words, phrases,
and teachings of the Realized One about that: 'This is another way of
saying that the unskillful should be given up.'

I've declared that: 'This is skillful.' And there are limitless words,
phrases, and teachings of the Realized One about that: 'This is another
way of saying that this is skillful.' I've declared: 'The skillful
should be developed.' And there are limitless words, phrases, and
teachings of the Realized One about that: 'This is another way of saying
that the skillful should be developed.'"

And then Upaka son of [Maṇḍikā]{lang="sa"} approved and agreed with what
the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully
circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went up to King
[Ajātasattu]{lang="sa"} of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha. He
told the King of all they had discussed.

But [Ajātasattu]{lang="sa"} became angry and upset, and said to Upaka,
"How rude of this salt-maker's boy! How scurrilous and impudent of him
to imagine he could attack the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully
awakened Buddha! Get out, Upaka, go away! Don't let me see you again."

### N 4.189 Things to be Realized  *Sacchikaraṇīyasutta* {#n-4.189-things-to-be-realized-sacchikaraṇīyasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, these four things should be realized. What four?

There are things to be realized with direct meditative experience. There
are things to be realized with recollection. There are things to be
realized with vision. There are things to be realized with wisdom.

What things are to be realized with direct meditative experience? The
eight liberations.

What things are to be realized with recollection? Past lives.

What things are to be realized with vision? The passing away and rebirth
of sentient beings.

What things are to be realized with wisdom? The ending of defilements.

These are the four things to be realized."

### N 4.190 Sabbath  *Uposathasutta* {#n-4.190-sabbath-uposathasutta .unnumbered}

At one time the Buddha was staying near [Sāvatthī]{lang="sa"} in the
stilt longhouse of [Migāra]{lang="sa"}'s mother in the Eastern
Monastery.

Now, at that time it was the sabbath, and the Buddha was sitting
surrounded by the [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"} of monks. Then the Buddha looked
around the [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"} of mendicants, who were so very silent.
He addressed them:

"This assembly has no chaff, mendicants, it is free of chaff, pure, and
consolidated in the core. Such is this [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"} of
mendicants, such is this assembly! An assembly such as this is rarely
seen in the world. An assembly such as this is worthy of offerings
dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious
donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field
of merit for the world. For an assembly such as this, giving little
becomes much, while giving much becomes even more. An assembly such as
this is worth traveling many leagues to see, even if you have to carry
your own provisions in a knapsack.

There are mendicants staying in this [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"} who have
attained to the gods. There are mendicants staying in this
[Saṅgha]{lang="sa"} who have attained to divinity. There are mendicants
staying in this [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"} who have attained to the
imperturbable. There are mendicants staying in this [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"}
who have attained to nobility.

And how has a mendicant attained to the gods? It's when a mendicant,
quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful
qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption ... As the placing
of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain
in the second absorption ... third absorption ... fourth absorption ...
That's how a mendicant has attained to the gods.

And how has a mendicant attained to divinity? Firstly, a mendicant
meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the
second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above,
below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love
to the whole world---abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and
ill will. Furthermore, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of
compassion ... rejoicing ... equanimity to one direction, and to the
second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above,
below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of
equanimity to the whole world---abundant, expansive, limitless, free of
enmity and ill will. That's how a mendicant has attained to divinity.

And how has a mendicant attained to the imperturbable? It's when a
mendicant---going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of
perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of
diversity---aware that 'space is infinite', enters and remains in the
dimension of infinite space. Going totally beyond the dimension of
infinite space, aware that 'consciousness is infinite', he enters and
remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. Going totally beyond
the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that 'there is nothing at
all', he enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness. Going
totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, he enters and remains in
the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. That's how a
mendicant has attained to the imperturbable.

And how has a mendicant attained to nobility? It's when they truly
understand: 'This is suffering' ... 'This is the origin of suffering'
... 'This is the cessation of suffering' ... 'This is the practice that
leads to the cessation of suffering'. That's how a mendicant has
attained to nobility."

"Mendicants, you can expect four benefits when the teachings have been
followed by ear, rehearsed, examined by the mind, and well comprehended
theoretically. What four?

Take a mendicant who memorizes the teaching---statements, mixed prose &
verse, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of
past lives, amazing stories, and elaborations. They've followed those
teachings by ear, rehearsed them, examined them by the mind, and well
comprehended them theoretically. But they die unmindful and are reborn
in one of the orders of gods. Being happy there, passages of the
teaching come back to them. Memory comes up slowly, but then that being
quickly reaches distinction. This is the first benefit you can expect
when the teachings have been followed by ear, rehearsed, examined by the

a mendicant with psychic powers, who has achieved mastery of the mind,
teaches Dhamma to the assembly of gods. They think: 'I used to lead the
spiritual life in this same teaching and training.' Memory comes up
slowly, but then that being quickly reaches distinction. Suppose a
person was skilled in the sound of drums. While traveling along a road
they hear the sound of drums. They wouldn't have any doubts or
uncertainties about whether that was the sound of drums or not. They'd
just conclude, 'That's the sound of drums.' In the same way, take a

used to lead the spiritual life?' He says: 'I remember, good sir, I
remember!' Memory comes up slowly, but then that being quickly reaches

### N 4.192 Facts  *Ṭhānasutta* {#n-4.192-facts-ṭhānasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, these four things can be known in four situations. What
four?

You can get to know a person's ethics by living with them. But only
after a long time, not casually; only when attentive, not when
inattentive; and only by the wise, not the witless.

You can get to know a person's purity by dealing with them. ...

You can get to know a person's resilience in times of trouble. ...

You can get to know a person's wisdom by discussion. But only after a
long time, not casually; only when attentive, not when inattentive; and
only by the wise, not the witless.

'You can get to know a person's ethics by living with them. But only
after a long time, not casually; only when attentive, not when
inattentive; and only by the wise, not the witless.' That's what I said,
but why did I say it? Take a person who's living with someone else. They
come to know: 'For a long time this venerable's deeds have been broken,
tainted, spotty, and marred. Their deeds and behavior are inconsistent.
This venerable is unethical, not ethical.'

Take another person who's living with someone else. They come to know:
'For a long time this venerable's deeds have been intact, impeccable,
spotless, and unmarred. Their deeds and behavior are consistent. This
venerable is ethical, not unethical.' That's why I said that you can get
to know a person's ethics by living with them. But only after a long
time, not a short time; only when attentive, not when inattentive; and
only by the wise, not the witless.

'You can get to know a person's purity by dealing with them. ...' That's
what I said, but why did I say it? Take a person who has dealings with
someone else. They come to know: 'This venerable deals with one person
in one way. Then they deal with two, three, or many people each in
different ways. They're not consistent from one deal to the next. This
venerable's dealings are impure, not pure.'

Take another person who has dealings with someone else. They come to
know: 'This venerable deals with one person in one way. Then they deal
with two, three, or many people each in the same way. They're consistent
from one deal to the next. This venerable's dealings are pure, not
impure.' That's why I said that you can get to know a person's purity by
dealing with them. ...

'You can get to know a person's resilience in times of trouble. ...'
That's what I said, but why did I say it? Take a person who experiences
loss of family, wealth, or health. But they don't reflect: 'Worldly life
is like that. Reincarnation in a life-form is like that. That's why the
eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and the world
revolves around the eight worldly conditions: gain and loss, fame and
disgrace, blame and praise, pleasure and pain.' They sorrow and wail and
lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.

long time, not casually; only when attentive, not when inattentive; and
only by the wise, not the witless.' That's what I said, but why did I
say it? Take a person who is discussing with someone else. They come to
know: 'Judging by this venerable's approach, by what they're getting at,
and by how they discuss a question, they're witless, not wise. Why is
that? This venerable does not bring up a deep and meaningful saying that
is peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible
to the astute. When this venerable speaks on Dhamma they're not able to
explain the meaning, either briefly or in detail. They can't teach it,
assert it, establish it, clarify it, analyze it, or reveal it. This
venerable is witless, not wise.'

Suppose a person with clear eyes was standing on the bank of a lake.
They'd see a little fish rising, and think: 'Judging by this fish's
approach, by the ripples it makes, and by its force, it's a little fish,
not a big one.' In the same way, a person who is discussing with someone
else would come to know: 'Judging by this venerable's approach, by what
they're getting at, and by how they discuss a question, they're witless,
not wise. ...'

Take another person who is discussing with someone else. They come to
know: 'Judging by this venerable's approach, by what they're getting at,

Suppose a man with clear eyes was standing on the bank of a lake. He'd
see a big fish rising, and think: 'Judging by this fish's approach, by
the ripples it makes, and by its force, it's a big fish, not a little
one.' In the same way, a person who is discussing with someone else
would come to know: 'Judging by this venerable's approach, by what
they're getting at, and by how they articulate a question, they're wise,
not witless. ...'

That's why I said that you can get to know a person's wisdom by
discussion. But only after a long time, not casually; only when
attentive, not when inattentive; and only by the wise, not the witless.

These are the four things that can be known in four situations."

### N 4.193 With Bhaddiya  *Bhaddiyasutta* {#n-4.193-with-bhaddiya-bhaddiyasutta .unnumbered}

At one time the Buddha was staying near [Vesālī]{lang="sa"}, at the
Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then Bhaddiya the Licchavi
went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, I have heard this: 'The ascetic Gotama is a magician. He knows a
conversion magic, and uses it to convert the disciples of those of other
religions.' I trust that those who say this repeat what the Buddha has
said, and do not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation
in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuttal
and criticism?"

"Please, Bhaddiya, don't go by oral transmission, don't go by lineage,
don't go by testament, don't go by canonical authority, don't rely on
logic, don't rely on inference, don't go by reasoned train of thought,
don't go by the acceptance of a view after deliberation, don't go by the
appearance of competence, and don't think 'The ascetic is our respected
teacher.' But when you know for yourselves: 'These things are
unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible people, and when you
undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering', then you should give
them up.

What do you think, Bhaddiya? Does greed come up in a person for their
welfare or harm?"

"Harm, sir."

"A greedy individual---overcome by greed---kills living creatures,
steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is
that for their lasting harm and suffering?"

"Yes, sir."

"What do you think, Bhaddiya? Does hate ... or delusion ... or
aggression come up in a person for their welfare or harm?"

"Harm, sir."

"An aggressive individual kills living creatures, steals, commits
adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their
lasting harm and suffering?"

"Yes, sir."

"What do you think, Bhaddiya, are these things skillful or unskillful?"

"Unskillful, sir."

"Blameworthy or blameless?"

"Blameworthy, sir."

"Criticized or praised by sensible people?"

"Criticized by sensible people, sir."

"When you undertake them, do they lead to harm and suffering, or not? Or
how do you see this?"

"When you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering. That's how we
see it."

"So, Bhaddiya, when we said: 'Please, Bhaddiya, don't go by oral
transmission, don't go by lineage, don't go by testament, don't go by
canonical authority, don't rely on logic, don't rely on inference, don't
go by reasoned train of thought, don't go by the acceptance of a view
after deliberation, don't go by the appearance of competence, and don't
think "The ascetic is our respected teacher." But when you know for
yourselves: "These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by
sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and
suffering", then you should give them up.' That's what I said, and this
is why I said it.

Please, Bhaddiya, don't rely on oral transmission ... But when you know
for yourselves: 'These things are skillful, blameless, praised by
sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to welfare and
happiness', then you should acquire them and keep them.

What do you think, Bhaddiya? Does contentment ... love ... understanding
... benevolence come up in a person for their welfare or harm?"

"Welfare, sir."

"An individual who is benevolent---not overcome by aggression---doesn't
kill living creatures, steal, commit adultery, lie, or encourage others
to do the same. Is that for their lasting welfare and happiness?"

"Yes, sir."

"What do you think, Bhaddiya, are these things skillful or unskillful?"

"Skillful, sir."

"Blameworthy or blameless?"

"Blameless, sir."

"Criticized or praised by sensible people?"

"Praised by sensible people, sir."

"When you undertake them, do they lead to welfare and happiness, or not?
Or how do you see this?"

"When you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness. That's how
we see it."

"So, Bhaddiya, when we said: 'Please, Bhaddiya, don't go by oral
transmission, don't go by lineage, don't go by testament, don't go by
canonical authority, don't rely on logic, don't rely on inference, don't
go by reasoned train of thought, don't go by the acceptance of a view
after deliberation, don't go by the appearance of competence, and don't
think "The ascetic is our respected teacher." But when you know for
yourselves: "These things are skillful, blameless, praised by sensible
people, and when you undertake them, they lead to welfare and
happiness", then you should acquire them and keep them.' That's what I
said, and this is why I said it.

The good and true persons in the world encourage their disciples:
'Please, mister, live rid of greed. Then you won't act out of greed by
way of body, speech, or mind. Live rid of hate ... delusion ...
aggression. Then you won't act out of hate ... delusion ... aggression
by way of body, speech, or mind."

When he said this, Bhaddiya the Licchavi said to the Buddha, "Excellent,
sir! ... From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay
follower who has gone for refuge for life."

"Well, Bhaddiya, did I say to you: 'Please, Bhaddiya, be my disciple,
and I will be your teacher'?"

"No, sir."

"Though I state and assert this, certain ascetics and brahmins
misrepresent me with the incorrect, hollow, false, untruthful claim:
'The ascetic Gotama is a magician. He knows a conversion magic, and uses
it to convert the disciples of those of other religions.'"

"Sir, this conversion magic is excellent. This conversion magic is
lovely! If my loved ones---relatives and kin---were to be converted by
this, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness. If all the
aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials were to be converted by
this, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness."

"That's so true, Bhaddiya! That's so true, Bhaddiya! If all the
aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials were to be converted by
this, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness. If the whole
world---with its gods, [Māras]{lang="sa"}, and divinities, this
population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans---were to be
converted by this, for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing
skillful qualities, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness.
If these great sal trees were to be converted by this, for giving up
unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities, it would be for
their lasting welfare and happiness---if they were sentient. How much
more then a human being!"

### N 4.194 At Sāpūga  *Sāmugiyasutta* {#n-4.194-at-sāpūga-sāmugiyasutta .unnumbered}

At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying in the land of the Koliyans,
where they have a town named [Sāpūga]{lang="sa"}. Then several Koliyans
from [Sāpūga]{lang="sa"} went up to Ānanda, bowed, and sat down to one
side. Then Venerable Ānanda said to them:

"Byagghapajjas, these four factors of trying to be pure have been
rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected
one, the fully awakened Buddha. They are in order to purify sentient
beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and
sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment. What
four? The factors of trying to be pure in ethics, mind, view, and
freedom.

And what is the factor of trying to be pure in ethics? It's when a
mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting
themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger
in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they've undertaken. This is
called purity of ethics. They think: 'I will fulfill such purity of
ethics, or, if it's already fulfilled, I'll support it in every
situation by wisdom.' Their enthusiasm for that---their effort, zeal,
vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness---is called
the factor of trying to be pure in ethics.

And what is the factor of trying to be pure in mind? It's when a
mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption ...
second absorption ... third absorption ... fourth absorption. This is
called purity of mind. They think: 'I will fulfill such purity of mind,
or, if it's already fulfilled, I'll support it in every situation by
wisdom.' Their enthusiasm for that---their effort, zeal, vigor,
perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness---is called the
factor of trying to be pure in mind.

And what is the factor of trying to be pure in view? Take a mendicant
who truly understands: 'This is suffering' ... 'This is the origin of
suffering' ... 'This is the cessation of suffering' ... 'This is the
practice that leads to the cessation of suffering'. This is called
purity of view. They think: 'I will fulfill such purity of view, or, if
it's already fulfilled, I'll support it in every situation by wisdom.'
Their enthusiasm for that---their effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance,
mindfulness, and situational awareness---is called the factor of trying
to be pure in view.

And what is the factor of trying to be pure in freedom? That noble
disciple---who has these factors of trying to be pure in ethics, mind,
and view---detaches their mind from things that arouse greed, and frees
their mind from things that it should be freed from. Doing so, they
experience perfect freedom. This is called purity of freedom. They
think: 'I will fulfill such purity of freedom, or, if it's already
fulfilled, I'll support it in every situation by wisdom.' Their
enthusiasm for that---their effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance,
mindfulness, and situational awareness---is called the factor of trying
to be pure in freedom.

These four factors of trying to be pure have been rightly explained by
the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully
awakened Buddha. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get
past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover
the system, and to realize extinguishment."

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near
Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. Then Vappa of the Sakyans, a
disciple of the Jains, went up to Venerable [Mahāmoggallāna]{lang="sa"},
bowed, and sat down to one side. [Mahāmoggallāna]{lang="sa"} said to
him:

"Vappa, take a person who, due to the fading away of ignorance and the
arising of knowledge, is restrained in body, speech, and mind. Do you
see any reason why defilements giving rise to painful feelings would
defile that person in the next life?"

"Sir, I do see such a case. Take a person who did bad deeds in a past
life. But the result of that has not yet ripened. For this reason
defilements giving rise to painful feelings would defile that person in
the next life." But this conversation between
[Mahāmoggallāna]{lang="sa"} and Vappa was left unfinished.

Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to
the assembly hall. He sat down on the seat spread out, and said to
[Mahāmoggallāna]{lang="sa"}, "[Moggallāna]{lang="sa"}, what were you
sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?"

[Moggallāna]{lang="sa"} repeated the entire conversation to the Buddha,
and concluded: "This was my conversation with Vappa that was unfinished
when the Buddha arrived."

Then the Buddha said to Vappa, "Vappa, we can discuss this. But only if
you allow what should be allowed, and reject what should be rejected.
And if you ask me the meaning of anything you don't understand, saying:
'Sir, why is this? What's the meaning of that?'"

"Sir, let us discuss this. I will do as you say."

"What do you think, Vappa? There are distressing and feverish
defilements that arise because of instigating bodily activity. These
don't occur in someone who refrains from such bodily activity. They
don't perform any new deeds, and old deeds are eliminated by
experiencing their results little by little. This wearing away is
apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting
inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for
themselves. Do you see any reason why defilements giving rise to painful
feelings would defile that person in the next life?"

"No, sir."

"What do you think, Vappa? There are distressing and feverish
defilements that arise because of instigating verbal activity. These
don't occur in someone who refrains from such verbal activity. They
don't perform any new deeds, and old deeds are eliminated by
experiencing their results little by little. This wearing away is
apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting
inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for
themselves. Do you see any reason why defilements giving rise to painful
feelings would defile that person in the next life?"

"No, sir."

"What do you think, Vappa? There are distressing and feverish
defilements that arise because of instigating mental activity. These
don't occur in someone who refrains from such mental activity. They
don't perform any new deeds, and old deeds are eliminated by
experiencing their results little by little. This wearing away is
apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting
inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for
themselves. Do you see any reason why defilements giving rise to painful
feelings would defile that person in the next life?"

"No, sir."

"What do you think, Vappa? There are distressing and feverish
defilements that arise because of ignorance. These don't occur when
ignorance fades away and knowledge arises. They don't perform any new
deeds, and old deeds are eliminated by experiencing their results little
by little. This wearing away is apparent in the present life,
immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible
people can know it for themselves. Do you see any reason why defilements
giving rise to painful feelings would defile that person in the next
life?"

"No, sir."

"A mendicant whose mind is rightly freed like this has achieved six
consistent responses. Seeing a sight with the eye, they're neither happy
nor sad, but remain equanimous, mindful and aware. Hearing a sound with
the ears ... Smelling an odor with the nose ... Tasting a flavor with
the tongue ... Feeling a touch with the body ... Knowing an idea with
the mind, they're neither happy nor sad, but remain equanimous, mindful
and aware. Feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: 'I
feel the end of the body approaching.' Feeling the end of life
approaching, they understand: 'I feel the end of life approaching.' They
understand: 'When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end,
everything that's felt, being no longer relished, will become cool right
here.'

Suppose there was a shadow cast by a post. Then along comes a person
with a spade and basket. They cut down the post at its base, dig it up,
and pull it out by its roots, right down to the fibers and stems. Then
they split it apart, cut up the parts, and chop them into splinters.
Next they dry the splinters in the wind and sun, burn them with fire,
and reduce them to ashes. Then they sweep away the ashes in a strong
wind, or float them away down a swift stream. And so the shadow cast by
the post is cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated,
and unable to arise in the future.

In the same way, a mendicant whose mind is rightly freed like this has
achieved six consistent responses. Seeing a sight with the eye, they're
neither happy nor sad, but remain equanimous, mindful and aware. Hearing
a sound with the ears ... Smelling an odor with the nose ... Tasting a
flavor with the tongue ... Feeling a touch with the body ... Knowing an
idea with the mind, they're neither happy nor sad, but remain
equanimous, mindful and aware. Feeling the end of the body approaching,
they understand: 'I feel the end of the body approaching.' Feeling the
end of life approaching, they understand: 'I feel the end of life
approaching.' They understand: 'When my body breaks up and my life has
come to an end, everything that's felt, being no longer relished, will
become cool right here.'"

When he said this, Vappa the Sakyan, the disciple of the Jains, said to
the Buddha:

"Sir, suppose there was a man who raised commercial horses for profit.
But he never made any profit, and instead just got weary and frustrated.
In the same way, I paid homage to those Jain fools for profit. But I
never made any profit, and instead just got weary and frustrated. From
this day forth, any confidence I had in those Jain fools I sweep away as
in a strong wind, or float away as down a swift stream.

Excellent, sir! ... From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a
lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."

### N 4.196 With Sāḷha  *Sāḷhasutta* {#n-4.196-with-sāḷha-sāḷhasutta .unnumbered}

At one time the Buddha was staying near [Vesālī]{lang="sa"}, at the
Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then [Sāḷha]{lang="sa"}
and Abhaya the Licchavis went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to him:

"There are, sir, some ascetics and brahmins who advocate crossing the
flood by means of two things: purification of ethics, and mortification
in disgust of sin. What does the Buddha say about this?"

"[Sāḷha]{lang="sa"}, purification of ethics is one of the factors of the
ascetic life, I say. But those ascetics and brahmins who teach fervent
mortification in disgust of sin---regarding it as essential and sticking
to it---are incapable of crossing the flood. And those ascetics and
brahmins whose livelihood and behavior by way of body, speech, and mind,
is not pure are also incapable of knowing and seeing, of supreme
awakening.

Suppose a man who wanted to cross a river took a sharp axe into a wood.
There he'd see a large green sal tree, straight and young and grown free
of defects. He'd cut it down at the base, cut off the top, and
completely strip off the branches and foliage. Then he'd trim it with
axes and machetes, plane it, and sand it with a rock. Finally, he'd
launch out on the river.

What do you think, [Sāḷha]{lang="sa"}? Is that man capable of crossing
the river?"

"No, sir. Why not? Because that green sal tree is well worked on the
outside, but inside it's still not cleared out. I'd expect that green
sal tree to sink, and the man to come to ruin."

"In the same way, [Sāḷha]{lang="sa"}, those ascetics and brahmins who
teach fervent mortification in disgust of sin---regarding it as
essential and sticking to it---are incapable of crossing the flood. And
those ascetics and brahmins whose livelihood and behavior by way of
body, speech, and mind is not pure are also incapable of knowing and
seeing, of supreme awakening.

But those ascetics and brahmins who don't teach mortification in disgust
of sin---not regarding it as essential or sticking to it---are capable
of crossing the flood. And those ascetics and brahmins whose behavior by
way of body, speech, and mind is pure are also capable of knowing and
seeing, of supreme awakening.

Suppose a man who wanted to cross a river took a sharp axe into a wood.
There he'd see a large green sal tree, straight and young and grown free
of defects. He'd cut it down at the base, cut off the top, and
completely strip off the branches and foliage. Then he'd trim it with
axes and machetes. Then he'd take a chisel and completely clear it out
inside. Then he'd plane it, sand it with a rock, and make it into a
boat. Finally he'd fix it with oars and rudder, and launch out on the
river.

What do you think, [Sāḷha]{lang="sa"}? Is that man capable of crossing
the river?"

"Yes, sir. Why is that? Because that green sal tree is well worked on
the outside, cleared out on the inside, made into a boat, and fixed with
oars and rudder. I'd expect that boat to not sink, and the man to safely
make it to the far shore."

"In the same way, [Sāḷha]{lang="sa"}, those ascetics and brahmins who
don't teach fervent mortification in disgust of sin---not regarding it
as essential or sticking to it---are capable of crossing the flood. And
those ascetics and brahmins whose behavior by way of body, speech, and
mind is pure are also capable of knowing and seeing, of supreme
awakening. Suppose there was a warrior who knew lots of fancy archery
tricks. It is only with these three factors that he becomes worthy of a
king, fit to serve a king, and is considered a factor of kingship. What
three? He's a long-distance shooter, a marksman, and one who shatters
large objects.

Just as a warrior is a long-distance shooter, a noble disciple has right
immersion. A noble disciple with right immersion truly sees any kind of
form at all---past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or
subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form---with right
understanding: 'This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.'
They truly see any kind of feeling ... perception ... choices ...
consciousness at all---past, future, or present; internal or external;
solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near, *all*
consciousness---with right understanding: 'This is not mine, I am not
this, this is not my self.'

Just as a warrior is a marksman, a noble disciple has right view. A
noble disciple with right view truly understands: 'This is suffering'
... 'This is the origin of suffering' ... 'This is the cessation of
suffering' ... 'This is the practice that leads to the cessation of
suffering'.

Just as a warrior shatters large objects, a noble disciple has right
freedom. A noble disciple with right freedom shatters the great mass of
ignorance."

### N 4.197 Queen Mallikā  *Mallikādevīsutta* {#n-4.197-queen-mallikā-mallikādevīsutta .unnumbered}

At one time the Buddha was staying near [Sāvatthī]{lang="sa"} in Jeta's
Grove, [Anāthapiṇḍika]{lang="sa"}'s monastery. Then Queen
[Mallikā]{lang="sa"} went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,
and said to him:

"What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why in this life some
females are ugly, unattractive, and bad-looking; and poor, with few
assets and possessions; and insignificant?

And why are some females ugly, unattractive, and bad-looking; but rich,
affluent, wealthy, and illustrious?

And why are some females attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing
beauty; but poor, with few assets and possessions; and insignificant?

And why are some females attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing
beauty; and rich, affluent, wealthy, and illustrious?"

"Take a female who is irritable and bad-tempered. Even when criticized a
little bit she loses her temper, becoming annoyed, hostile, and
hard-hearted, and displaying annoyance, hate, and bitterness. She
doesn't give to ascetics or brahmins such things as food, drink,
clothing, vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and
lighting. And she's jealous, envying, resenting, and begrudging the
possessions, honor, respect, reverence, homage, and veneration given to
others. If she comes back to this place after passing away, wherever she
is reborn she's ugly, unattractive, and bad-looking; and poor, with few
assets and possessions; and insignificant.

Take another female who is irritable and bad-tempered. ... But she does
give to ascetics or brahmins ... And she's not jealous ... If she comes
back to this place after passing away, wherever she is reborn she's
ugly, unattractive, and bad-looking; but rich, affluent, wealthy, and
illustrious.

Take another female who isn't irritable and bad-tempered. ... But she
doesn't give to ascetics or brahmins ... And she's jealous ... If she
comes back to this place after passing away, wherever she is reborn
she's attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty; but poor,
with few assets and possessions; and insignificant.

Take another female who isn't irritable and bad-tempered. ... She gives
to ascetics and brahmins ... And she's not jealous ... If she comes back
to this place after passing away, wherever she is reborn she's
attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty; and rich,
affluent, wealthy, and illustrious.

This is why some females are ugly ... and poor ... and insignificant.
And some females are ugly ... but rich ... and illustrious. And some
females are attractive ... but poor ... and insignificant. And some
females are attractive ... and rich ... and illustrious."

When this was said, Queen [Mallikā]{lang="sa"} said to the Buddha:

"Sir, in another life I must have been irritable and bad-tempered. Even
when lightly criticized I must have lost my temper, becoming annoyed,
hostile, and hard-hearted, and displaying annoyance, hate, and
bitterness. For now I am ugly, unattractive, and bad-looking.

In another life I must have given to ascetics or brahmins such things as
food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and
bed, house, and lighting. For now I am rich, affluent, and wealthy.

In another life, I must not have been jealous, envying, resenting, and
begrudging the possessions, honor, respect, reverence, homage, and
veneration given to others. For now I am illustrious. In this royal
court I command maidens of the aristocrats, brahmins, and householders.
So, sir, from this day forth I will not be irritable and bad-tempered.
Even when heavily criticized I won't lose my temper, become annoyed,
hostile, and hard-hearted, or display annoyance, hate, and bitterness. I
will give to ascetics or brahmins such things as food, drink, clothing,
vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting.
I will not be jealous, envying, resenting, and begrudging the
possessions, honor, respect, reverence, homage, and veneration given to
others.

Excellent, sir! ... From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a
lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."

### N 4.198 Fervent Mortification of Oneself  *Attantapasutta* {#n-4.198-fervent-mortification-of-oneself-attantapasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, these four people are found in the world. What four?

1.  One person mortifies themselves, pursuing the practice of mortifying
    themselves.

2.  One person mortifies others, pursuing the practice of mortifying
    others.

3.  One person mortifies themselves and others, pursuing the practice of
    mortifying themselves and others.

4.  One person neither mortifies themselves nor others, pursuing the
    practice of not mortifying themselves or others. They live without
    wishes in this very life, quenched, cooled, experiencing bliss, with
    self become divine.

And how does one person mortify themselves, pursuing the practice of
mortifying themselves? It's when someone goes naked, ignoring
conventions. They lick their hands, and don't come or wait when called.
They don't consent to food brought to them, or food prepared on their
behalf, or an invitation for a meal. They don't receive anything from a
pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a
shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a
woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who lives with a man; or where
there's a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or
beer or wine, and drink no fermented gruel. They go to just one house
for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up
to seven houses and seven mouthfuls. They feed on one saucer a day, two
saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day. They eat once a day, once
every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a
fortnight. They live pursuing the practice of eating food at set
intervals.

They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran,
scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survive
on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit.

They wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags,
lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark,
wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls' wings. They tear out
hair and beard, pursuing this practice. They constantly stand, refusing
seats. They squat, committed to the endeavor of squatting. They lie on a
mat of thorns, making a mat of thorns their bed. They're devoted to
ritual bathing three times a day, including the evening. And so they
live pursuing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body.
That's how one person mortifies themselves, pursuing the practice of
mortifying themselves.

And how does one person mortify others, pursuing the practice of
mortifying others? It's when a person is a slaughterer of sheep, pigs,
poultry, or deer, a hunter or fisher, a bandit, an executioner, a
butcher of cattle, a jailer, or has some other cruel livelihood. That's
how one person mortifies others, pursuing the practice of mortifying
others.

And how does one person mortify themselves and others, pursuing the
practice of mortifying themselves and others? It's when a person is an
anointed aristocratic king or a well-to-do brahmin. He has a new
ceremonial hall built to the east of the citadel. He shaves off his hair
and beard, dresses in a rough antelope hide, and smears his body with
ghee and oil. Scratching his back with antlers, he enters the hall with
his chief queen and the brahmin high priest. There he lies on the bare
ground strewn with grass. The king feeds on the milk from one teat of a
cow that has a calf of the same color. The chief queen feeds on the milk
from the second teat. The brahmin high priest feeds on the milk from the
third teat. The milk from the fourth teat is served to the sacred flame.
The calf feeds on the remainder. He says: 'Slaughter this many bulls,
bullocks, heifers, goats, rams, and horses for the sacrifice! Fell this
many trees and reap this much grass for the sacrificial equipment!' His
bondservants, servants, and workers do their jobs under threat of
punishment and danger, weeping, with tearful faces. That's how one
person mortifies themselves and others, pursuing the practice of
mortifying themselves and others.

And how does one person neither mortify themselves nor others, pursuing
the practice of not mortifying themselves or others, living without
wishes in this very life, quenched, cooled, experiencing bliss, with
self become divine? It's when a Realized One arises in the world,
perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and
conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to
train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. He has realized
with his own insight this world---with its gods, [Māras]{lang="sa"}, and
divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and
humans---and he makes it known to others. He proclaims a teaching that
is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end,
meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that's
entirely full and pure. A householder hears that teaching, or a
householder's child, or someone reborn in a good family. They gain faith
in the Realized One and reflect: 'Life at home is cramped and dirty,
life gone forth is wide open. It's not easy for someone living at home
to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.
Why don't I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go
forth from the lay life to homelessness?' After some time they give up a
large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave
off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life
to homelessness.

Once they've gone forth, they take up the training and livelihood of the
mendicants. They give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod
and the sword. They're scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for
all living beings. They give up stealing. They take only what's given,
and expect only what's given. They keep themselves clean by not
thieving. They give up unchastity. They are celibate, set apart,
avoiding the vulgar act of sex. They give up lying. They speak the truth
and stick to the truth. They're honest and dependable, and don't trick
the world with their words. They give up divisive speech. They don't
repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people
against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided,
supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words
that promote harmony. They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way
that's mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite,
likable, and agreeable to the people. They give up talking nonsense.
Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching
and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable,
reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.

They refrain from injuring plants and seeds. They eat in one part of the
day, abstaining from eating at night and food at the wrong time. They
refrain from seeing shows of dancing, singing, and music . They refrain
from beautifying and adorning themselves with garlands, fragrance, and
makeup. They refrain from high and luxurious beds. They refrain from
receiving gold and currency, raw grains, raw meat, women and girls, male
and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants,
cows, horses, and mares, and fields and land. They refrain from running
errands and messages; buying and selling; falsifying weights, metals, or
measures; bribery, fraud, cheating, and duplicity; mutilation, murder,
abduction, banditry, plunder, and violence.

They're content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look
after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these
things. They're like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only
burden. In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after
the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they
set out taking only these things. When they have this entire spectrum of
noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves.

Seeing a sight with the eyes, they don't get caught up in the features
and details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad
unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become
overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the
faculty of sight, and achieving restraint over it. Hearing a sound with
the ears ... Smelling an odor with the nose ... Tasting a flavor with
the tongue ... Feeling a touch with the body ... Knowing an idea with
the mind, they don't get caught up in the features and details. If the
faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of
covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason,
they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving
restraint over it. When they have this noble sense restraint, they
experience an unsullied bliss inside themselves.

They act with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when
looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when
bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing,
and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing,
sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.

When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, this noble
contentment, this noble sense restraint, and this noble mindfulness and
situational awareness, they frequent a secluded lodging---a wilderness,
the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground,
a forest, the open air, a heap of straw. After the meal, they return
from almsround, sit down cross-legged, set their body straight, and
establish mindfulness in their presence. Giving up covetousness for the
world, they meditate with a heart rid of covetousness, cleansing the
mind of covetousness. Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate
with a mind rid of ill will, full of sympathy for all living beings,
cleansing the mind of ill will. Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they
meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light,
mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness. Giving
up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their
mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse.
Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided
about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt. They give up
these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.
Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful
qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption ... second
absorption ... third absorption ... fourth absorption.

When their mind has become immersed in [samādhi]{lang="sa"} like
this---purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable,
workable, steady, and imperturbable---they extend it toward recollection
of past lives ... knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings
... knowledge of the ending of defilements. They truly understand: 'This
is suffering' ... 'This is the origin of suffering' ... 'This is the
cessation of suffering' ... 'This is the practice that leads to the
cessation of suffering'. They truly understand: 'These are defilements'
... 'This is the origin of defilements' ... 'This is the cessation of
defilements' ... 'This is the practice that leads to the cessation of
defilements'.

Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements
of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. When they're freed,
they know they're freed.

They understand: 'Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been
completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further
for this place.' That's how one person neither mortifies themselves nor
others, pursuing the practice of not mortifying themselves or others,
living without wishes in this very life, quenched, cooled, experiencing
bliss, with self become divine.

These are the four people found in the world."

### N 4.199 Craving, the Weaver  *Taṇhāsutta* {#n-4.199-craving-the-weaver-taṇhāsutta .unnumbered}

The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, I will teach you about craving---the weaver, the migrant,
the creeping, the clinging. This world is choked by it, engulfed by it.
It makes the world tangled like yarn, knotted like a ball of thread, and
matted like rushes and reeds, not escaping the places of loss, the bad
places, the underworld, transmigration. Listen and apply your mind well,
I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"And what is that craving ...? There are eighteen currents of craving
that derive from the interior, and eighteen that derive from the
exterior.

What are the eighteen currents of craving that derive from the interior?
When there is the concept 'I am', there are the concepts 'I am such', 'I
am thus', 'I am otherwise'; 'I am fleeting', 'I am lasting'; 'mine',
'such is mine', 'thus is mine', 'otherwise is mine'; 'also mine', 'such
is also mine', 'thus is also mine', 'otherwise is also mine'; 'I will
be', 'I will be such', 'I will be thus', 'I will be otherwise'. These
are the eighteen currents of craving that derive from the interior.

What are the eighteen currents of craving that derive from the exterior?
When there is the concept 'I am because of this', there are the concepts
'I am such because of this', 'I am thus because of this', 'I am
otherwise because of this'; 'I am fleeting because of this', 'I am
lasting because of this'; 'mine because of this', 'such is mine because
of this', 'thus is mine because of this', 'otherwise is mine because of
this'; 'also mine because of this', 'such is also mine because of this',
'thus is also mine because of this', 'otherwise is also mine because of
this'; 'I will be because of this', 'I will be such because of this', 'I
will be thus because of this', 'I will be otherwise because of this'.
These are the eighteen currents of craving that derive from the
exterior.

So there are eighteen currents of craving that derive from the interior,
and eighteen that derive from the exterior. These are called the
thirty-six currents of craving. Each of these pertain to the past,
future, and present, making one hundred and eight currents of craving.

This is that craving---the weaver, the migrant, the creeping, the
clinging. This world is choked by it, engulfed by it. It makes the world
tangled like yarn, knotted like a ball of thread, and matted like rushes
and reeds, not escaping the places of loss, the bad places, the
underworld, transmigration."

### N 4.200 Love and Hate  *Pemasutta* {#n-4.200-love-and-hate-pemasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, these four things are born of love and hate. What four?

1.  Love is born of love,

2.  hate is born of love,

3.  love is born of hate, and

4.  hate is born of hate.

And how is love born of love? It's when someone likes, loves, and cares
for a person. Others treat that person with liking, love, and care. They
think: 'These others like the person I like.' And so love for them
springs up. That's how love is born of love.

And how is hate born of love? It's when someone likes, loves, and cares
for a person. Others treat that person with disliking, loathing, and
detestation. They think: 'These others dislike the person I like.' And
so hate for them springs up. That's how hate is born of love.

And how is love born of hate? It's when someone dislikes, loathes, and
detests a person. Others treat that person with disliking, loathing, and
detestation. They think: 'These others dislike the person I dislike.'
And so love for them springs up. That's how love is born of hate.

And how is hate born of hate? It's when someone dislikes, loathes, and
detests a person. Others treat that person with liking, love, and care.
They think: 'These others like the person I dislike.' And so hate for
them springs up. That's how hate is born of hate.

These are the four things that are born of love and hate.

A time comes when a mendicant ... enters and remains in the first
absorption. At that time they have no love born of love, hate born of
love, love born of hate, or hate born of hate.

A time comes when a mendicant ... enters and remains in the second
absorption ... third absorption ... fourth absorption. At that time they
have no love born of love, hate born of love, love born of hate, or hate
born of hate.

A time comes when a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart
and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized
it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. At that time
any love born of love, hate born of love, love born of hate, or hate
born of hate is given up, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump,
obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. This is called a
mendicant who doesn't draw close or push back or fume or ignite or burn
up.

And how does a mendicant draw close? It's when a mendicant regards form
as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They regard
feeling as self, self as having feeling, feeling in self, or self in
feeling. They regard perception as self, self as having perception,
perception in self, or self in perception. They regard choices as self,
self as having choices, choices in self, or self in choices. They regard
consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in
self, or self in consciousness. That's how a mendicant draws close.

And how does a mendicant not draw close? It's when a mendicant doesn't
regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.
They don't regard feeling as self, self as having feeling, feeling in
self, or self in feeling. They don't regard perception as self, self as
having perception, perception in self, or self in perception. They don't
regard choices as self, self as having choices, choices in self, or self
in choices. They don't regard consciousness as self, self as having
consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. That's
how a mendicant doesn't draw close.

And how does a mendicant push back? It's when someone abuses, annoys, or
argues with a mendicant, and the mendicant abuses, annoys, or argues
back at them. That's how a mendicant pushes back.

And how does a mendicant not push back? It's when someone abuses,
annoys, or argues with a mendicant, and the mendicant doesn't abuse,
annoy, or argue back at them. That's how a mendicant doesn't push back.

And how does a mendicant fume? When there is the concept 'I am', there
are the concepts 'I am such', 'I am thus', 'I am otherwise'; 'I am
fleeting', 'I am lasting'; 'mine', 'such is mine', 'thus is mine',
'otherwise is mine'; 'also mine', 'such is also mine', 'thus is also
mine', 'otherwise is also mine'; 'I will be', 'I will be such', 'I will
be thus', 'I will be otherwise'. That's how a mendicant fumes.

And how does a mendicant not fume? When there is no concept 'I am',
there are no concepts 'I am such', 'I am thus', 'I am otherwise'; 'I am
fleeting', 'I am lasting'; 'mine', 'such is mine', 'thus is mine',
'otherwise is mine'; 'also mine', 'such is also mine', 'thus is also
mine', 'otherwise is also mine'; 'I will be', 'I will be such', 'I will
be thus', 'I will be otherwise'. That's how a mendicant doesn't fume.

And how is a mendicant ignited? When there is the concept 'I am because
of this', there are the concepts 'I am such because of this', 'I am thus
because of this', 'I am otherwise because of this'; 'I am fleeting
because of this', 'I am lasting because of this'; 'mine because of
this', 'such is mine because of this', 'thus is mine because of this',
'otherwise is mine because of this'; 'also mine because of this', 'such
is also mine because of this', 'thus is also mine because of this',
'otherwise is also mine because of this'; 'I will be because of this',
'I will be such because of this', 'I will be thus because of this', 'I
will be otherwise because of this'. That's how a mendicant is ignited.

And how is a mendicant not ignited? When there is no concept 'I am
because of this', there are no concepts 'I am such because of this', 'I
am thus because of this', 'I am otherwise because of this'; 'I am
fleeting because of this', 'I am lasting because of this'; 'mine because
of this', 'such is mine because of this', 'thus is mine because of
this', 'otherwise is mine because of this'; 'also mine because of this',
'such is also mine because of this', 'thus is also mine because of
this', 'otherwise is also mine because of this'; 'I will be because of
this', 'I will be such because of this', 'I will be thus because of
this', 'I will be otherwise because of this'. That's how a mendicant is
not ignited.

And how does a mendicant burn up? It's when a mendicant hasn't given up
the conceit 'I am', cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump,
obliterated it, so it's unable to arise in the future. That's how a
mendicant is burned up.

And how does a mendicant not burn up? It's when a mendicant has given up
the conceit 'I am', cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump,
obliterated it, so it's unable to arise in the future. That's how a
mendicant is not burned up."

4.  neither dark nor bright deeds with neither dark nor bright results,

And what are dark deeds with dark results? It's when someone makes
hurtful choices by way of body, speech, and mind. Having made these
choices, they're reborn in a hurtful world, where hurtful contacts
strike them. Touched by hurtful contacts, they experience hurtful
feelings that are exclusively painful---like the beings in hell. These
are called dark deeds with dark results.

And what are bright deeds with bright results? It's when someone makes
pleasing choices by way of body, speech, and mind. Having made these
choices, they're reborn in a pleasing world, where pleasing contacts
strike them. Touched by pleasing contacts, they experience pleasing
feelings of perfect happiness---like the gods of universal beauty. These
are called bright deeds with bright results.

And what are dark and bright deeds with dark and bright results? It's
when someone makes both hurtful and pleasing choices by way of body,
speech, and mind. Having made these choices, they are reborn in a world
that is both hurtful and pleasing, where hurtful and pleasing contacts
strike them. Touched by both hurtful and pleasing contacts, they
experience both hurtful and pleasing feelings that are a mixture of
pleasure and pain---like humans, some gods, and some beings in the

At one time the Buddha was staying near [Kosambī]{lang="sa"}, in
Ghosita's Monastery. Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed,
and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, "Well, Ānanda, has
that disciplinary issue been settled yet?"

"How could it be, sir? Venerable Anuruddha's protégé [Bāhiya]{lang="sa"}
remains entirely committed to creating a schism in the
[Saṅgha]{lang="sa"}. But Anuruddha doesn't think to say a single word
about it."

"But Ānanda, since when has Anuruddha been involved in disciplinary
issues in the midst of the [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"}? Shouldn't you, together
with [Sāriputta]{lang="sa"} and [Moggallāna]{lang="sa"}, settle all
disciplinary issues that come up?

A bad monk sees four reasons to relish schism in the
[Saṅgha]{lang="sa"}. What four? Take an unethical monk, of bad
qualities, filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true ascetic
or spiritual practitioner---though claiming to be one---rotten inside,
festering, and depraved. He thinks: 'Suppose the monks know that I'm a
bad monk ... If they're in harmony, they'll expel me, but if they're
divided they won't.' A bad monk sees this as the first reason to relish
schism in the [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"}.

Furthermore, a bad monk has wrong view, he's attached to an extremist
view. He thinks: 'Suppose the monks know that I have wrong view ... If
they're in harmony they'll expel me, but if they're divided they won't.'
A bad monk sees this as the second reason to relish schism in the
[Saṅgha]{lang="sa"}.

Furthermore, a bad monk has wrong livelihood and earns a living by wrong
livelihood. He thinks: 'Suppose the monks know that I have wrong
livelihood ... If they're in harmony they'll expel me, but if they're
divided they won't.' A bad monk sees this as the third reason to relish
schism in the [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"}.

Furthermore, a bad monk desires material things, honor, and admiration.
He thinks: 'Suppose the monks know that I desire material things, honor,
and admiration. If they're in harmony they won't honor, respect, revere,
or venerate me, but if they're divided they will.' A bad monk sees this
as the fourth reason to relish schism in the [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"}.

### N 4.244 Perils of Offenses  *Āpattibhayasutta* {#n-4.244-perils-of-offenses-āpattibhayasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, there are these four perils of offenses. What four?

Suppose they were to arrest a bandit, a criminal and present him to the
king, saying: 'Your Majesty, this is a bandit, a criminal. May Your
Majesty punish them!' The king would say: 'Go, my men, and tie this
man's arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope. Shave his head
and march him from street to street and square to square to the beating
of a harsh drum. Then take him out the south gate and there, to the
south of the city, chop off his head.' The king's men would do as they
were told. Then a bystander might think: 'This man must have done a
truly bad and reprehensible deed, a capital offense. There's no way I'd
ever do such a bad and reprehensible deed, a capital offense.' In the
same way, take any monk or nun who has set up such an acute perception
of peril regarding expulsion offenses. It can be expected that if they
haven't committed an expulsion offense they won't, and if they committed
one they will deal with it properly.

Suppose a man was to put on a black cloth, mess up his hair, and put a
club on his shoulder. Then he approaches a large crowd and says: 'Sirs,
I've done a bad and reprehensible deed, deserving of clubbing. I submit
to your pleasure.' Then a bystander might think: 'This man must have
done a truly bad and reprehensible deed, deserving of clubbing. ...
There's no way I'd ever do such a bad and reprehensible deed, deserving
of clubbing.' In the same way, take any monk or nun who has set up such
an acute perception of peril regarding suspension offenses. It can be
expected that if they haven't committed a suspension offense they won't,
and if they committed one they will deal with it properly.

Suppose a man was to put on a black cloth, mess up his hair, and put a
sack of ashes on his shoulder. Then he approaches a large crowd and
says: 'Sirs, I've done a bad and reprehensible deed, deserving of a sack
of ashes. I submit to your pleasure.' Then a bystander might think:
'This man must have done a truly bad and reprehensible deed, deserving
of a sack of ashes. ... There's no way I'd ever do such a bad and
reprehensible deed, deserving of a sack of ashes.' In the same way, take
any monk or nun who has set up such an acute perception of peril
regarding confessable offenses. It can be expected that if they haven't
committed a confessable offense they won't, and if they committed one
they will deal with it properly.

Suppose a man was to put on a black cloth and mess up his hair. Then he
approaches a large crowd and says: 'Sirs, I've done a bad and
reprehensible deed, deserving of criticism. I submit to your pleasure.'
Then a bystander might think: 'This man must have done a truly bad and
reprehensible deed, deserving of criticism. ... There's no way I'd ever
do such a bad and reprehensible deed, deserving of criticism.' In the
same way, take any monk or nun who has set up such an acute perception
of peril regarding acknowledgable offenses. It can be expected that if
they haven't committed an acknowledgeable offense they won't, and if
they committed one they will deal with it properly.

These are the four perils of offenses."

with wisdom as its overseer, with freedom as its core, and with
mindfulness as its ruler.

And how is training its benefit? Firstly, I laid down for my disciples
the training that deals with supplementary regulations in order to
inspire confidence in those without it and to increase confidence in
those who have it. They undertake whatever supplementary regulations I
have laid down, keeping them intact, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred.

Furthermore, I laid down for my disciples the training that deals with
the fundamentals of the spiritual life in order to rightly end suffering
in every way. They undertake whatever training that deals with the
fundamentals of the spiritual life I have laid down, keeping it intact,
impeccable, spotless, and unmarred. That's how training is its benefit.

And how is wisdom its overseer? I taught the Dhamma to my disciples in
order to rightly end suffering in every way. They examine with wisdom
any teachings I taught them. That's how wisdom is its overseer.

And how is freedom its core? I taught the Dhamma to my disciples in
order to rightly end suffering in every way. They experience through
freedom any teachings I taught them. That's how freedom is its core.

And how is mindfulness its ruler? Mindfulness is well established in
oneself: 'In this way I'll fulfill the training dealing with
supplementary regulations, or support with wisdom in every situation the
training dealing with supplementary regulations I've already fulfilled.'
Mindfulness is well established in oneself: 'In this way I'll fulfill

the teaching that I haven't yet examined, or support with wisdom in
every situation the teaching I've already examined.' Mindfulness is well
established in oneself: 'In this way I'll experience through freedom the
teaching that I haven't yet experienced, or support with wisdom in every
situation the teaching I've already experienced.' That's how mindfulness
is its ruler.

'This spiritual life is lived with training as its benefit, with wisdom

ruler.' That's what I said, and this is why I said it."

"Mendicants, there are these four ways of lying down. What four? The
ways a corpse, a pleasure seeker, a lion, and a Realized One lie down.

And how does a corpse lie down? Corpses usually lie flat on their backs.
This is called the way a corpse lies down.

And how does a pleasure seeker lie down? Pleasure seekers usually lie
down on their left side. This is called the way a pleasure seeker lies
down.

And how does a lion lie down? The lion, king of beasts, lies down on the
right side, placing one foot on top of the other, with his tail tucked
between his thighs. When he wakes, he lifts his front quarters and
checks his hind quarters. If he sees that any part of his body is
disordered or displaced, he is displeased. But if he sees that no part
of his body is disordered or displaced, he is pleased. This is called
the way a lion lies down.

And how does a Realized One lie down? It's when a Realized One, quite
secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities,
enters and remains in the first absorption ... second absorption ...
third absorption ... fourth absorption. This is called the way a
Realized One lies down.

Then Venerable [Māluṅkyaputta]{lang="sa"} went up to the Buddha, bowed,
sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I've heard
it, I'll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute."

"Well now, [Māluṅkyaputta]{lang="sa"}, what are we to say to the young
monks, when even an old man like you, elderly and senior, asks the
Realized One for brief advice?"

"Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief! May the Holy One
teach me the Dhamma in brief! Hopefully I can understand the meaning of
what the Buddha says! Hopefully I can be an heir of the Buddha's
teaching!"

"[Māluṅkyaputta]{lang="sa"}, there are four things that give rise to
craving in a mendicant. What four? For the sake of robes, almsfood,
lodgings, or rebirth in this or that state. These are the four things
that give rise to craving in a mendicant. That craving is given up by a
mendicant, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and
unable to arise in the future. Then they're called a mendicant who has
cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending
conceit has made an end of suffering."

When [Māluṅkyaputta]{lang="sa"} had been given this advice by the
Buddha, he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the
Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. Then
[Māluṅkyaputta]{lang="sa"}, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and
resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in
this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal
for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.

lost; they don't fix old things; they eat and drink too much; or they
put an unethical woman or man in charge. When families don't stay

### N 4.259 A Thoroughbred (1st)  *Paṭhamaājānīyasutta* {#n-4.259-a-thoroughbred-1st-paṭhamaājānīyasutta .unnumbered}

"Mendicants, a fine royal thoroughbred with four factors is worthy of a
king, fit to serve a king, and considered a factor of kingship. What
four? It's when a fine royal thoroughbred is beautiful, strong, fast,
and well-proportioned. A fine royal thoroughbred with these four factors
is worthy of a king. ...

In the same way, a mendicant with four qualities is worthy of offerings
dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious
donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme
field of merit for the world. What four? It's when a mendicant is
beautiful, strong, fast, and well proportioned.

And how is a mendicant beautiful? It's when a mendicant is ethical,
restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and
resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest
fault, they keep the rules they've undertaken. That's how a mendicant is
beautiful.

And how is a mendicant strong? It's when a mendicant lives with energy
roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful
qualities. They are strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it
comes to developing skillful qualities. That's how a mendicant is
strong.

And how is a mendicant fast? It's when they truly understand: 'This is
suffering' ... 'This is the origin of suffering' ... 'This is the
cessation of suffering' ... 'This is the practice that leads to the
cessation of suffering'. That's how a mendicant is fast.

And how is a mendicant well proportioned? It's when a mendicant receives
robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.
That's how a mendicant is well proportioned.

A mendicant with these four qualities ... is the supreme field of merit
for the world."

### The Translator {#the-translator .unnumbered}

Bhikkhu Sujato was born as Anthony Aidan Best on 4/11/1966 in Perth,
Western Australia. He grew up in the pleasant suburbs of Mt Lawley and
Attadale alongside his sister Nicola, who was the good child. His
mother, Margaret Lorraine Huntsman née Pinder, said "he'll either be a
priest or a poet", while his father, Anthony Thomas Best, advised him to
"never do anything for money". He attended Aquinas College, a Catholic
school, where he decided to become an atheist. At the University of WA
he studied philosophy, aiming to learn what he wanted to do with his
life. Finding that what he wanted to do was play guitar, he dropped out.
His main band was named Martha's Vineyard, which achieved modest success
in the indie circuit.

A seemingly random encounter with a roadside joey took him to Thailand,
where he entered his first meditation retreat at Wat Ram Poeng, Chieng
Mai in 1992. Feeling the call to the Buddha's path, he took full
ordination in Wat Pa Nanachat in 1994, where his teachers were Ajahn
Pasanno and Ajahn Jayasaro. In 1997 he returned to Perth to study with
Ajahn Brahm at Bodhinyana Monastery.

He spent several years practicing in seclusion in Malaysia and Thailand
before establishing Santi Forest Monastery in Bundanoon, NSW, in 2003.
There he was instrumental in supporting the establishment of the
Theravada bhikkhuni order in Australia and advocating for women's
rights. He continues to teach in Australia and globally, with a special
concern for the moral implications of climate change and other forms of
environmental destruction. He has published a series of books of
original and groundbreaking research on early Buddhism.

In 2005 he founded SuttaCentral together with Rod Bucknell and John
Kelly. In 2015, seeing the need for a complete, accurate, plain English
translation of the Pali texts, he undertook the task, spending nearly
three years in isolation on the isle of Qi Mei off the coast of the
nation of Taiwan. He completed the four main [Nikāyas]{lang="sa"} in
2018, and the early books of the Khuddaka [Nikāya]{lang="sa"} were
complete by 2021. All this work is dedicated to the public domain and is
entirely free of copyright encumbrance.

In 2019 he returned to Sydney where he established Lokanta Vihara (The
Monastery at the End of the World).

### Creation Process {#creation-process .unnumbered}

staying in Qimei, Taiwan.
