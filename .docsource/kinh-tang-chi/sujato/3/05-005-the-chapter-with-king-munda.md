# The Chapter with King Muṇḍa

### N 5.41 Getting Rich  *Ādiyasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Then the householder
Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to
one side. The Buddha said to him:

"Householder, there are these five reasons to get rich. What five?

Firstly, with his legitimate wealth---earned by his efforts and
initiative, built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the
brow---a noble disciple makes himself happy and pleased, keeping himself
properly happy. He makes his mother and father happy ... He makes his
children, partners, bondservants, workers, and staff happy ... This is
the first reason to get rich.

Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he makes his friends and
colleagues happy ... This is the second reason to get rich.

Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he protects himself against
losses from such things as fire, water, kings, bandits, or unloved
heirs. He keeps himself safe. This is the third reason to get rich.

Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he makes five spirit-offerings:
to relatives, guests, ancestors, king, and deities. This is the fourth
reason to get rich.

Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he establishes an uplifting
religious donation for ascetics and brahmins---those who refrain from
intoxication and negligence, are settled in patience and sweetness, and
who tame, calm, and extinguish themselves---that's conducive to heaven,
ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven. This is the fifth reason to
get rich.

These are the five reasons to get rich.

Now if the riches a noble disciple gets for these five reasons run out,
he thinks: 'So, the riches I have obtained for these reasons are running
out.' And so he has no regrets.

But if the riches a noble disciple gets for these five reasons increase,
he thinks: 'So, the riches I have obtained for these reasons are
increasing.' And so he has no regrets in both cases.

> 'I've enjoyed my wealth,\
> \>supporting those who depend on me;\
> I've overcome losses;\
> I've given uplifting religious donations;\
> and made the five spirit-offerings.\
> I have looked after the ethical and\
> disciplined spiritual practitioners.
>
> I've achieved the purpose\
> for which an astute lay person\
> wishes to gain wealth.\
> I don't regret what I've done.'
>
> A mortal person who recollects this\
> stands firm in the teaching of the noble ones.\
> They're praised in this life by the astute,\
> and they depart to rejoice in heaven."

### N 5.42 A True Person  *Sappurisasutta*

"Mendicants, a true person is born in a family for the benefit, welfare,
and happiness of the people. For the benefit, welfare, and happiness of
mother and father; children and partners; bondservants, workers, and
staff; friends and colleagues; and ascetics and brahmins.

It's like a great rain cloud, which nourishes all the crops for the
benefit, welfare, and happiness of the people. In the same way, a true
person is born in a family for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of
the people. ...

> The gods protect one who is guarded by principle,\
> who uses their wealth for the welfare of the many.\
> One who is learned,\
> \>with precepts and observances intact,\
> and steady in principle, doesn't lose their reputation.
>
> Firm in principle, accomplished in ethical conduct,\
> truthful, conscientious;\
> like a pendant of Black Plum River gold,\
> who is worthy to criticize them?\
> Even the gods praise them,\
> and by the Divinity, too, they're praised."

### N 5.43 Likable  *Iṭṭhasutta*

Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha,
bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:

"Householder, these five things, which are likable, desirable, and
agreeable are hard to get in the world. What five? Long life, beauty,
happiness, fame, and heaven. These are the five things, which are
likable, desirable, and agreeable, but hard to get in the world.

And I say that these five things are not got by praying or wishing for
them. If they were, who would lack them?

A noble disciple who wants to live long ought not pray for it, or hope
for it, or pine for it. Instead, they should practice the way that leads
to long life. For by practicing that way they gain long life as a god or
a human being.

A noble disciple who wants to be beautiful ought not pray for it, or
hope for it, or pine for it. Instead, they should practice the way that
leads to beauty. For by practicing that way they gain beauty as a god or
a human being.

A noble disciple who wants to be happy ought not pray for it, or hope
for it, or pine for it. Instead, they should practice the way that leads
to happiness. For by practicing that way they gain happiness as a god or
a human being.

A noble disciple who wants to be famous ought not pray for it, or hope
for it, or pine for it. Instead, they should practice the way that leads
to fame. For by practicing that way they gain fame as a god or a human
being.

A noble disciple who wants to go to heaven ought not pray for it, or
hope for it, or pine for it. Instead, they should practice the way that
leads to heaven. For by practicing that way they gain heaven, they are
one who gains the heavens.

> For one who desires a continuous flow\
> of exceptional delights---\
> long life, beauty, fame and reputation,\
> heaven, and birth in an eminent family---
>
> the astute praise diligence\
> in making merit.\
> Being diligent, an astute person\
> secures both benefits:
>
> the benefit in this life,\
> and in lives to come.\
> An attentive one, comprehending the meaning,\
> is called 'astute'."

### N 5.44 Agreeable  *Manāpadāyīsutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the
Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then the Buddha robed up
in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the
householder Ugga of Vesālī, where he sat on the seat spread
out.

Then Ugga went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said
to him, "Sir, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the
Buddha: 'The giver of the agreeable gets the agreeable.' My sal flower
porridge is agreeable: may the Buddha please accept it from me out of
sympathy." So the Buddha accepted it out of sympathy.

"Sir, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha: 'The
giver of the agreeable gets the agreeable.' My pork with jujube is
agreeable: may the Buddha please accept it from me out of sympathy." So
the Buddha accepted it out of sympathy.

"... My fried vegetable stalks are agreeable: may the Buddha please
accept them from me out of sympathy." So the Buddha accepted them out of
sympathy.

"... My boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out, served with
many soups and sauces is agreeable: may the Buddha please accept it from
me out of sympathy." So the Buddha accepted it out of sympathy.

"... My cloths imported from Kāsi are agreeable: may the
Buddha please accept them from me out of sympathy." So the Buddha
accepted them out of sympathy.

"... My couch spread with woolen covers---shag-piled or embroidered with
flowers---and spread with a fine deer hide, with a canopy above and red
pillows at both ends is agreeable. But, sir, I know that this is not
proper for the Buddha. However, this plank of sandalwood is worth over a
thousand dollars. May the Buddha please accept it from me out of
sympathy." So the Buddha accepted it out of sympathy.

And then the Buddha rejoiced with Ugga with these verses of
appreciation:

> "The giver of the agreeable gets the agreeable,\
> enthusiastically giving clothing, bedding,\
> food and drink, and various requisites\
> to those of sincere conduct.
>
> Knowing the perfected ones to be like a field\
> for what's given, offered and not held back,\
> a true person gives what's hard to give:\
> the giver of the agreeable gets the agreeable."

And then the Buddha, having rejoiced with Ugga with these verses of
appreciation, got up from his seat and left.

Then after some time Ugga passed away, and was reborn in a host of
mind-made gods. At that time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery.

Then, late at night, the glorious god Ugga, lighting up the entire
Jeta's Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. The
Buddha said to him, "Ugga, I trust it is all you wished?"

"Sir, it is indeed just as I wished." Then the Buddha addressed Ugga in
verse:

> "The giver of the agreeable gets the agreeable,\
> the giver of the foremost gets the foremost,\
> the giver of the excellent gets the excellent,\
> the giver of the best gets the best.
>
> A person who gives the foremost,\
> the excellent, the best:\
> they're long-lived and famous\
> wherever they're reborn."

### N 5.45 Overflowing Merit  *Puññābhisandasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these five kinds of overflowing merit,
overflowing goodness. They nurture happiness and are conducive to
heaven, ripening in happiness and leading to heaven. They lead to what
is likable, desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness.

What five? When a mendicant enters and remains in a limitless immersion
of heart while using a robe ... almsfood ... lodging ... bed and chair
... medicines and supplies for the sick, the overflowing of merit for
the donor is limitless ...

These are the five kinds of overflowing merit, overflowing goodness.
They nurture happiness, and are conducive to heaven, ripening in
happiness, and leading to heaven. They lead to what is likable,
desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness.

When a noble disciple has these five kinds of overflowing merit and
goodness, it's not easy to grasp how much merit they have by saying that
this is the extent of their overflowing merit ... that leads to
happiness. It's simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great
mass of merit.

It's like trying to grasp how much water is in the ocean. It's not easy
to say: 'This is how many gallons, how many hundreds, thousands,
hundreds of thousands of gallons there are.' It's simply reckoned as an
incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of water.

In the same way, when a noble disciple has these five kinds of
overflowing merit and goodness, it's not easy to grasp how much merit
they have: 'This is how much this overflowing merit ... leads to
happiness.' It's simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great
mass of merit.

> Hosts of people use the rivers,\
> and though the rivers are many,\
> all reach the great deep, the boundless ocean,\
> the cruel sea that's home to precious gems.
>
> So too, when a person gives food, drink, and clothes;\
> and they're a giver of beds, seats, and mats---\
> the streams of merit reach that astute person,\
> as the rivers bring their waters to the sea."

### N 5.46 Success  *Sampadāsutta*

"Mendicants, there are five accomplishments. What five? Accomplishment
in faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom. These are the five
accomplishments."

<!--pg-->
### N 5.47 Wealth  *Dhanasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these five kinds of wealth. What five? The wealth
of faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.

And what is the wealth of faith? It's when a noble disciple has faith in
the Realized One's awakening: 'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully
awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of
the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods
and humans, awakened, blessed.' This is called the wealth of faith.

And what is the wealth of ethics? It's when a noble disciple doesn't
kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or consume
beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants. This is called the wealth of ethics.

And what is the wealth of learning? It's when a noble disciple is very
learned, remembering and keeping what they've learned. These teachings
are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end,
meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that's
totally full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings,
remembering them, reciting them, mentally scrutinizing them, and
comprehending them theoretically. This is called the wealth of learning.

And what is the wealth of generosity? It's when a noble disciple lives
at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed,
loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.
This is called the wealth of generosity.

And what is the wealth of wisdom? It's when a noble disciple is wise.
They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble,
penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. This is
called the wealth of wisdom.

These are the five kinds of wealth.

> Whoever has faith in the Realized One,\
> unwavering and well grounded;\
> whose ethical conduct is good,\
> praised and loved by the noble ones;
>
> who has confidence in the Saṅgha,\
> and correct view:\
> they're said to be prosperous,\
> their life is not in vain.
>
> So let the wise devote themselves\
> to faith, ethical behavior,\
> confidence, and insight into the teaching,\
> remembering the instructions of the Buddhas."

### N 5.48 Things That Cannot Be Had  *Alabbhanīyaṭhānasutta*

"Mendicants, there are five things that cannot be had by any ascetic or
brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone in the
world. What five? That someone liable to old age should not grow old.
That someone liable to sickness should not get sick. ... That someone
liable to death should not die. ... That someone liable to ending should
not end. ... That someone liable to perishing should not perish. ...

An unlearned ordinary person has someone liable to old age who grows
old. But they don't reflect on old age: 'It's not just me who has
someone liable to old age who grows old. For as long as sentient beings
come and go, pass away and are reborn, they all have someone liable to
old age who grows old. If I were to sorrow and wail and lament, beating
my breast and falling into confusion, just because someone liable to old
age grows old, I'd lose my appetite and my physical appearance would
deteriorate. My work wouldn't get done, my enemies would be encouraged,
and my friends would be dispirited.' And so, when someone liable to old
age grows old, they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and
falling into confusion. This is called an unlearned ordinary person
struck by sorrow's poisoned arrow, who only mortifies themselves.

Furthermore, an unlearned ordinary person has someone liable to sickness
... death ... ending ... perishing. But they don't reflect on perishing:
'It's not just me who has someone liable to perishing who perishes. For
as long as sentient beings come and go, pass away and are reborn, they
all have someone liable to perishing who perishes. If I were to sorrow
and wail and lament, beating my breast and falling into confusion, just
because someone liable to perishing perishes, I'd lose my appetite and
my physical appearance would deteriorate. My work wouldn't get done, my
enemies would be encouraged, and my friends would be dispirited.' And
so, when someone liable to perishing perishes, they sorrow and wail and
lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion. This is called
an unlearned ordinary person struck by sorrow's poisoned arrow, who only
mortifies themselves.

A learned noble disciple has someone liable to old age who grows old. So
they reflect on old age: 'It's not just me who has someone liable to old

and are reborn, they all have someone liable to old age who grows old.
If I were to sorrow and wail and lament, beating my breast and falling

lose my appetite and my physical appearance would deteriorate. My work
wouldn't get done, my enemies would be encouraged, and my friends would
be dispirited.' And so, when someone liable to old age grows old, they
don't sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into
confusion. This is called a learned noble disciple who has drawn out
sorrow's poisoned arrow, struck by which unlearned ordinary people only
mortify themselves. Sorrowless, free of thorns, that noble disciple only
extinguishes themselves.

Furthermore, a learned noble disciple has someone liable to sickness ...
death ... ending ... perishing. So they reflect on perishing: 'It's not
just me who has someone liable to perishing who perishes. For as long as
sentient beings come and go, pass away and are reborn, they all have
someone liable to perishing who perishes. If I were to sorrow and wail
and lament, beating my breast and falling into confusion, just because
someone liable to perishing perishes, I'd lose my appetite and my
physical appearance would deteriorate. My work wouldn't get done, my
enemies would be encouraged, and my friends would be dispirited.' And

is called a learned noble disciple who has drawn out sorrow's poisoned
arrow, struck by which unlearned ordinary people only mortify
themselves. Sorrowless, free of thorns, that noble disciple only
extinguishes themselves.

These are the five things that cannot be had by any ascetic or brahmin
or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone in the world.

> Sorrowing and lamenting\
> doesn't do even a little bit of good.\
> When they know that you're sad,\
> your enemies are encouraged.
>
> When an astute person doesn't waver\
> \>in the face of adversity,\
> as they're able to evaluate what's beneficial,\
> their enemies suffer,\
> seeing that their normal expression doesn't change.
>
> Chants, recitations, fine sayings,\
> charity or traditions:\
> if by means of any such things you benefit,\
> then by all means keep doing them.
>
> But if you understand that 'this good thing\
> can't be had by me or by anyone else',\
> you should accept it without sorrowing, thinking:\
> 'The deed is powerful. What can I do now?'"

### N 5.49 The King of Kosala  *Kosalasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Then King Pasenadi of
Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.

Then a man went up to the king and whispered in his ear, "Your Majesty,
Queen Mallikā has passed away."

When this was said, King Pasenadi was miserable and sad. He sat with his
shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.

Knowing this, the Buddha said to him, "Great king, there are five things
that cannot be had by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra
or divinity or by anyone in the world. What five? That someone liable to
old age should not grow old. ... Sorrowing and lamenting doesn't do even
a little bit of good ... 'The deed is powerful. What can I do now?'"

<!--pg-->
### N 5.50 With Nārada  *Nāradasutta*

At one time Venerable Nārada was staying near
Pāṭaliputta, in the Chicken Monastery.

Now at that time King Muṇḍa's dear and beloved Queen
Bhaddā had just passed away. And since that time, the king
did not bathe, anoint himself, eat his meals, or apply himself to his
work. Day and night he brooded over Queen Bhaddā's corpse.

Then King Muṇḍa addressed Piyaka, the keeper of the
treasury,

"So, my good Piyaka, please place Queen Bhaddā's corpse in
an iron case filled with oil. Then close it up with another case, so
that we can view Queen Bhaddā's body even longer."

"Yes, Your Majesty," replied Piyaka, and he did as the king instructed.

Then it occurred to Piyaka, "King Muṇḍa's dear and beloved
Queen Bhaddā has passed away. Since then the king does not
bathe, anoint himself, eat his meals, or apply himself to his work. Day
and night he broods over Queen Bhaddā's corpse. Now, what
ascetic or brahmin might the king pay homage to, whose teaching could
help the king give up sorrow's arrow?"

Then it occurred to Piyaka, "This Venerable Nārada is
staying in the Chicken Monastery at Pāṭaliputta. He has
this good reputation: 'He is astute, competent, intelligent, learned, a
brilliant speaker, eloquent, mature, a perfected one.' What if King
Muṇḍa was to pay homage to Venerable Nārada?
Hopefully when he hears Nārada's teaching, the king could
give up sorrow's arrow."

Then Piyaka went to the king and said to him, "Sire, this Venerable
Nārada is staying in the Chicken Monastery at
Pāṭaliputta. He has this good reputation: 'He is astute,
competent, intelligent, learned, a brilliant speaker, eloquent, mature,
a perfected one.' What if Your Majesty was to pay homage to Venerable
Nārada? Hopefully when you hear Nārada's
teaching, you could give up sorrow's arrow."

"Well then, my good Piyaka, let Nārada know. For how could
one such as I presume to visit an ascetic or brahmin in my realm without
first letting them know?"

"Yes, Your Majesty," replied Piyaka. He went to Nārada,
bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, "Sir, King
Muṇḍa's dear and beloved Queen Bhaddā has
passed away. And since she passed away, the king has not bathed,
anointed himself, eaten his meals, or got his business done. Day and
night he broods over Queen Bhaddā's corpse. Sir, please
teach the king so that, when he hears your teaching, he can give up
sorrow's arrow."

"Please, Piyaka, let the king come when he likes."

Then Piyaka got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled
Venerable Nārada, keeping him on his right, before going to
the king and saying, "Sire, the request for an audience with Venerable
Nārada has been granted. Please, Your Majesty, go at your
convenience."

"Well then, my good Piyaka, harness the finest chariots."

"Yes, Your Majesty," replied Piyaka. He did so, then told the king:

"Sire, the finest chariots are harnessed. Please, Your Majesty, go at
your convenience."

Then King Muṇḍa mounted a fine carriage and, along with
other fine carriages, set out in full royal pomp to see Venerable
Nārada at the Chicken Monastery. He went by carriage as far
as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on
foot. Then the king went up to Nārada, bowed, and sat down
to one side. Then Nārada said to him:

"Great king, there are five things that cannot be had by any ascetic or
brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone in the
world. What five? That someone liable to old age should not grow old.
... That someone liable to sickness should not get sick. ... That
someone liable to death should not die. ... That someone liable to
ending should not end. ... That someone liable to perishing should not
perish. ...

An unlearned ordinary person has someone liable to old age who grows
old. But they don't reflect on old age: 'It's not just me who has
someone liable to old age who grows old. For all sentient beings have
someone liable to old age who grows old, as long as sentient beings come
and go, pass away and are reborn. If I were to sorrow and wail and
lament, beating my breast and falling into confusion, just because
someone liable to old age grows old, I'd lose my appetite and my
physical appearance would deteriorate. My work wouldn't get done, my
enemies would be encouraged, and my friends would be dispirited.' And
so, when someone liable to old age grows old, they sorrow and wail and
lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion. This is called
an unlearned ordinary person struck by sorrow's poisoned arrow, who only
mortifies themselves.

Furthermore, an unlearned ordinary person has someone liable to sickness
... death ... ending ... perishing. But they don't reflect on perishing:
'It's not just me who has someone liable to perishing who perishes. For
all sentient beings have someone liable to perishing who perishes, as
long as sentient beings come and go, pass away and are reborn. If I were
to sorrow and wail and lament, beating my breast and falling into
confusion, just because someone liable to perishing perishes, I'd lose

be dispirited.' And so, when someone liable to perishing perishes, they
sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into
confusion. This is called an unlearned ordinary person struck by
sorrow's poisoned arrow, who only mortifies themselves.

A learned noble disciple has someone liable to old age who grows old. So
they reflect on old age: 'It's not just me who has someone liable to old
age who grows old. For all sentient beings have someone liable to old
age who grows old, as long as sentient beings come and go, pass away and
are reborn. If I were to sorrow and wail and lament, beating my breast
and falling into confusion, just because someone liable to old age grows
old, I'd lose my appetite and my physical appearance would deteriorate.
My work wouldn't get done, my enemies would be encouraged, and my
friends would be dispirited.' And so, when someone liable to old age
grows old, they don't sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast
and falling into confusion. This is called a learned noble disciple who
has drawn out sorrow's poisoned arrow, struck by which unlearned
ordinary people only mortify themselves. Sorrowless, free of thorns,
that noble disciple only extinguishes themselves.

Furthermore, a learned noble disciple has someone liable to sickness ...
death ... ending ... perishing. So they reflect on perishing: 'It's not
just me who has someone liable to perishing who perishes. For all
sentient beings have someone liable to perishing who perishes, as long
as sentient beings come and go, pass away and are reborn. If I were to
sorrow and wail and lament, beating my breast and falling into
confusion, just because someone liable to perishing perishes, I'd lose
my appetite and my physical appearance would deteriorate. My work
wouldn't get done, my enemies would be encouraged, and my friends would

confusion. This is called a learned noble disciple who has drawn out
sorrow's poisoned arrow, struck by which unlearned ordinary people only
mortify themselves. Sorrowless, free of thorns, that noble disciple only
extinguishes themselves.

These are the five things that cannot be had by any ascetic or brahmin
or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone in the world.

> Sorrowing and lamenting\
> doesn't do even a little bit of good.\
> When they know that you're sad,\

> 'The deed is powerful. What can I do now?'"

When he said this, King Muṇḍa said to Venerable
Nārada, "Sir, what is the name of this exposition of the
teaching?"

"Great king, this exposition of the teaching is called 'Pulling Out
Sorrow's Arrow'."

"Indeed, sir, this is the pulling out of sorrow's arrow! Hearing this
exposition of the teaching, I've given up sorrow's arrow."

Then King Muṇḍa addressed Piyaka, the keeper of the
treasury, "Well then, my good Piyaka, cremate Queen
Bhaddā's corpse and build a monument. From this day forth,
I will bathe, anoint myself, eat my meals, and apply myself to my work."
