# Linked Discourses with Spirits

## The Chapter with Indaka

### N 10.1 With Indaka *Indakasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha on Mount Indra's Peak, the haunt of the native
spirit Indaka.

Then the native spirit Indaka went up to the Buddha, and addressed him
in verse:

> "The Buddhas say that form is not the soul.\
> Then how does this body manifest?\
> Where do the bones and liver come from?\
> And how does one cling on in the womb?"
>
> "First there's a drop of coagulate;\
> from there a little bud appears;\
> next it becomes a piece of flesh;\
> which produces a swelling.\
> From that swelling the limbs appear,\
> the head hair, body hair, and nails.
>
> And whatever the mother eats---\
> the food and drink that she consumes---\
> nourishes them there,\
> the person in the mother's womb."

### N 10.2 With a Spirit Named Sakka *Sakkanāmasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the
Vulture's Peak Mountain.

Then a spirit named Sakka went up to the Buddha, and addressed him in
verse:

> "You've given up all ties,\
> and are fully freed.\
> It's not a good idea for you, ascetic,\
> to be instructing others."
>
> "No matter what the apparent reason\
> why people are together, Sakka,\
> it's unworthy for a wise person\
> to not think of the other with sympathy.
>
> If you instruct others\
> with a mind clear and confident,\
> your compassion and empathy\
> don't create attachments."

### N 10.3 With Spiky *Sūcilomasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Gayā on the
cut-stone ledge in the haunt of Spiky the native spirit.

Now at that time the native spirits Shaggy and Spiky were passing by not
far from the Buddha.

So Shaggy said to Spiky, "That's an ascetic."

"That's no ascetic, he's a faker! I'll soon find out whether he's an
ascetic or a faker."

Then Spiky went up to the Buddha and leaned up against his body, but the
Buddha pulled away.

Then Spiky said to the Buddha, "Are you afraid, ascetic?"

"No, good sir, I'm not afraid. But your touch is nasty."

"I will ask you a question, ascetic. If you don't answer me, I'll drive
you insane, or explode your heart, or grab you by the feet and throw you
to the far shore of the Ganges!"

"I don't see anyone in this world with its gods, Māras, and
Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and
humans who could do that to me. But anyway, ask what you wish."

> "Where do greed and hate come from?\
> From where spring discontent, desire, and terror?\
> Where do the mind's thoughts originate,\
> like a crow let loose by boys."
>
> "Greed and hate come from here;\
> from here spring discontent, desire, and terror;\
> here's where the mind's thoughts originate,\
> like a crow let loose by boys.
>
> Born of affection, originating in oneself,\
> like the shoots from a banyan's trunk;\
> the many kinds of attachment to sensual pleasures\
> are like camel's foot creeper\
> \>creeping through the woods.
>
> Those who understand where they come from\
> get rid of them---listen up, spirit!\
> They cross this flood so hard to cross,\
> not crossed before, so as to not be reborn."

### N 10.4 With Maṇibhadda *Maṇibhaddasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans at the
Maṇimālika Tree-shrine, the haunt of the native spirit
Maṇibhadda.

Then the native spirit Maṇibhadda went up to the Buddha,
and recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "It's always auspicious for the mindful;\
> the mindful prosper in happiness.\
> Each new day is better for the mindful,\
> and they're freed from enmity."
>
> "It's always auspicious for the mindful;\
> the mindful prosper in happiness.\
> Each new day is better for the mindful,\
> but they're not freed from enmity.
>
> But someone whose mind delights in harmlessness,\
> all day and all night,\
> with love for all living creatures---\
> they have no enmity for anyone."

### N 10.5 With Sānu *Sānusutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

Now at that time a certain lay woman had a son named Sānu
who had been possessed by a native spirit. And as that lay woman wept,
on that occasion she recited these verses:

> "I have heard this from the perfected ones.\
> The native spirits will not mess with anyone\
> who leads the spiritual life\
> by observing the sabbath
>
> complete in all eight factors\
> on the fourteenth and the fifteenth days,\
> and the eighth day of the fortnight,\
> as well as on the fortnight of special displays.\
> But now today I see\
> native spirits messing with Sānu."
>
> "What you heard from the perfected ones is right.\
> The native spirits will not mess with anyone\
> who leads the spiritual life\
> by observing the sabbath
>
> complete in all eight factors\
> on the fourteenth and the fifteenth days,\
> and the eighth day of the fortnight,\
> as well as on the fortnight of special displays.
>
> When Sānu regains consciousness tell him\
> this saying of the native spirits:\
> Don't do bad deeds\
> either openly or in secret.
>
> If you should do a bad deed,\
> or you're doing one now,\
> you won't be freed from suffering,\
> though you fly away and flee."
>
> "Mum, they cry for the dead,\
> or for one who's alive but has disappeared.\
> I'm alive and you can see me,\
> so mum, why do you weep for me?"
>
> "Son, they cry for the dead,\
> or for one who's alive but has disappeared.\
> But someone who has given up sensual pleasures\
> only to come back here again:\
> they cry for them as well,\
> for though still alive they're really dead.
>
> My dear, you've been rescued from hot coals,\
> and you want to plunge right back in them!\
> My dear, you've been rescued from the abyss,\
> and you want to plunge right back there!
>
> Keep pushing forward, it's what's best for you!\
> Who have I got to complain to?\
> When your things have been saved from a fire,\
> would you want them to be burnt again?"

### N 10.6 With Piyaṅkara *Piyaṅkarasutta*

At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery.

Now at that time Venerable Anuruddha rose at the crack of dawn and
recited passages of the teaching. Then the native spirit
Piyaṅkara's Mother soothed her little child, saying:

> "Don't make a sound, Piyaṅkara!\
> A mendicant recites passages of the teaching.\
> When we understand a passage,\
> we can practice for our welfare.
>
> Let us restrain ourselves from harming living creatures,\
> and speak no lying words.\
> We should train ourselves well in ethics,\
> and hopefully we'll be freed from the goblin realm."

### N 10.7 With Punabbasu *Punabbasusutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

Now at that time the Buddha was educating, encouraging, firing up, and
inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk about extinguishment. And
those mendicants were paying attention, applying the mind, concentrating
wholeheartedly, and actively listening.

Then the native spirit Punabbasu's Mother soothed her little children,
saying:

> "Hush, little Uttarā!\
> Hush, Punabbasu!\
> For I want to listen to the teaching\
> of the Teacher, the supreme Buddha.
>
> Since the Blessed One spoke of extinguishment,\
> the release from all ties,\
> I have a lasting love\
> for this teaching.
>
> In this world, your own child is dear;\
> in this world, your own husband is dear;\
> but even greater than that is my love\
> for this teaching's quest.
>
> For neither son nor husband,\
> dear as they are, can free you from suffering;\
> as listening to the true teaching\
> frees living creatures from suffering.
>
> In this world mired in suffering,\
> fettered by old age and death,\
> I want to listen to the teaching\
> that the Buddha awakened to,\
> which frees you from old age and death.\
> So hush, Punabbasu!"
>
> "Mom, I'm not speaking,\
> and Uttarā is silent, too.\
> Focus just on the teaching,\
> for it's nice to listen to the true teaching.\
> And it's because we haven't understood the teaching\
> that we live in suffering, Mom.
>
> He is a beacon for those who are lost\
> among gods and humans.\
> The Buddha, bearing his final body,\
> the Clear-eyed One teaches Dhamma."
>
> "It's good that my child's so astute,\
> this child I bore and suckled!\
> My child loves the pure teaching\
> of the supreme Buddha.
>
> Punabbasu, may you be happy!\
> Today, I rise.\
> Hear me too, Uttarā:\
> I have seen the noble truths!"

### N 10.8 With Sudatta *Sudattasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the
Cool Grove.

Now at that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika had arrived
at Rājagaha on some business. He heard a rumor that a
Buddha had arisen in the world.

Right away he wanted to go and see the Buddha, but he thought, "It's too
late to go and see the Buddha today. I'll go and see him tomorrow." He
went to bed thinking of the Buddha.

During the night he got up three times thinking it was morning. Then he
approached the Sivaka Gate, and non-human beings opened it for him.

But as he was leaving the city, light vanished and darkness appeared to
him. He felt fear, terror, and goosebumps, and wanted to turn back.

Then the vanished spirit Sivaka called out:

> "A hundred elephants, a hundred horses,\
> a hundred mule-drawn chariots,\
> a hundred thousand maidens\
> bedecked with jeweled earrings:\
> these are not worth a sixteenth part\
> of a single forward stride!
>
> Forward, householder!\
> Forward, householder!\
> Going forward is better for you,\
> not turning back!"

Then darkness vanished and light appeared to Anāthapiṇḍika.
His fear, terror, and goosebumps settled down.

But for a second time, light vanished and darkness appeared to him. ...

For a second time the vanished spirit Sivaka called out ...

> "... Going forward is better for you,\
> not turning back!"

Then darkness vanished and light appeared to Anāthapiṇḍika.
His fear, terror, and goosebumps settled down.

But for a third time, light vanished and darkness appeared to him. ...

For a third time the vanished spirit Sivaka called out ...

> "... Going forward is better for you,\
> not turning back!"

Then darkness vanished and light appeared to Anāthapiṇḍika.
His fear, terror, and goosebumps settled down. Then the householder
Anāthapiṇḍika went to the Cool Grove and approached the
Buddha.

Now at that time the Buddha had risen at the crack of dawn and was
walking mindfully in the open. He saw Anāthapiṇḍika coming
off in the distance. So he stepped down from the walking path, sat down
on the seat spread out, and said to Anāthapiṇḍika, "Come,
Sudatta."

Then Anāthapiṇḍika thought, "The Buddha calls me by name!"
Smiling and elated, he bowed with his head at the Buddha's feet and said
to him, "Sir, I trust the Buddha slept well?"

> "A brahmin who is fully quenched\
> always sleeps at ease.\
> Sensual pleasures slip off them,\
> they're cooled, free of attachments.
>
> Since they've cut off all clinging,\
> and removed the stress from the heart,\
> the peaceful sleep at ease,\
> having found peace of mind."

### N 10.9 With the Nun Sukkā (1st) *Paṭhamasukkāsutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the
Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding ground.

Now, at that time the nun Sukkā was teaching Dhamma,
surrounded by a large assembly. Then a native spirit was so devoted to
Sukkā that he went from street to street and from square to
square, and on that occasion recited these verses:

> "What's up with these people in Rājagaha?\
> They sleep like they've been drinking mead!\
> They don't attend on Sukkā\
> as she's teaching the state free of death.
>
> But the wise---\
> it's as if they drink it up,\
> so irresistible, delicious, and nutritious,\
> like travelers enjoying a cool cloud."

### N 10.10 With the Nun Sukkā (2nd) *Dutiyasukkāsutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the
Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding ground.

Now at that time a certain lay follower gave food to the nun
Sukkā. Then a native spirit was so devoted to
Sukkā that he went from street to street and from square to
square, and on that occasion recited these verses:

> "O! He has made so much merit!\
> That lay follower is so very wise.\
> He just gave food to Sukkā,\
> who is released from all ties."

### N 10.11 With the Nun Cīrā *Cīrāsutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding
ground.

Now at that time a certain lay follower gave a robe to the nun
Cīrā. Then a native spirit was so devoted to
Cīrā that he went from street to street and from square to
square, and on that occasion recited these verses:

> "O! He has made so much merit!\
> That lay-follower is so very wise.\
> He gave a robe to Cīrā,\
> who is released from all yokes."

### N 10.12 With Āḷavaka *Āḷavakasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Āḷavī in the haunt of the native spirit
Āḷavaka.

Then the native spirit Āḷavaka went up to the Buddha, and
said to him: "Get out, ascetic!"

Saying, "All right, good sir," the Buddha went out.

"Get in, ascetic!"

Saying, "All right, good sir," the Buddha went in.

And for a second time the native spirit Āḷavaka said to the
Buddha, "Get out, ascetic!"

Saying, "All right, good sir," the Buddha went out.

"Get in, ascetic!"

Saying, "All right, good sir," the Buddha went in.

And for a third time the native spirit Āḷavaka said to the
Buddha, "Get out, ascetic!"

Saying, "All right, good sir," the Buddha went out.

"Get in, ascetic!"

Saying, "All right, good sir," the Buddha went in.

And for a fourth time the native spirit Āḷavaka said to the
Buddha,

"Get out, ascetic!"

"No, good sir, I won't get out. Do what you must."

"I will ask you a question, ascetic. If you don't answer me, I'll drive
you insane, or explode your heart, or grab you by the feet and throw you
to the far shore of the Ganges!"

"I don't see anyone in this world with its gods, Māras, and
Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and
humans who could do that to me. But anyway, ask what you wish."

> "What's a person's best wealth?\
> What brings happiness when practiced well?\
> What's the sweetest taste of all?\
> The one they say has the best life: how do they live?"
>
> "Faith here is a person's best wealth.\
> The teaching brings happiness when practiced well.\
> Truth is the sweetest taste of all.\
> The one they say has the best life lives by wisdom."
>
> "How do you cross the flood?\
> How do you cross the deluge?\
> How do you get over suffering?\
> How do you get purified?"
>
> "By faith you cross the flood,\
> and by diligence the deluge.\
> By energy you get past suffering,\
> and you're purified by wisdom."
>
> "How do you get wisdom?\
> How do you earn wealth?\
> How do you get a good reputation?\
> How do you hold on to friends?\
> How do the departed not grieve\
> when passing from this world to the next?"
>
> "One who is diligent and discerning\
> gains wisdom by wanting to learn,\
> having faith in the perfected ones,\
> and the teaching for becoming extinguished.
>
> Being responsible, acting appropriately,\
> and working hard you earn wealth.\
> Truthfulness wins you a good reputation.\
> You hold on to friends by giving.\
> That's how the departed do not grieve\
> when passing from this world to the next.
>
> A faithful householder\
> who has these four qualities\
> does not grieve after passing away:\
> truth, principle, steadfastness, and generosity.
>
> Go ahead, ask others as well,\
> there are many ascetics and brahmins.\
> See whether anything better is found\
> than truth, self-control, generosity, and patience."
>
> "Why now would I question\
> the many ascetics and brahmins?\
> Today I understand\
> what's good for the next life.
>
> It was truly for my benefit\
> that the Buddha came to stay at Āḷavī.\
> Today I understand\
> where a gift is very fruitful.
>
> I myself will journey\
> village to village, town to town,\
> paying homage to the Buddha,\
> and the natural excellence of the teaching!"
