# Linked Discourses With King Pasenadi of Kosala

## Chapter One

### N 3.1 Young *Daharasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery.

Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, and exchanged
greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were
over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, "Does the worthy
Gotama claim to have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening?"

"If anyone should rightly be said to have awakened to the supreme
perfect awakening, it's me. For, great king, I have awakened to the
supreme perfect awakening."

"Well, there are those ascetics and brahmins who lead an order and a
community, and tutor a community. They're well-known and famous
religious founders, deemed holy by many people. That is,
Pūraṇa Kassapa, the bamboo-staffed ascetic
Gosāla, the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan,
Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, Pakudha
Kaccāyana, and Ajita of the hair blanket. I also asked them
whether they claimed to have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening,
but they made no such claim. So why do you, given that you're so young
in age and newly gone forth?"

"Great king, these four things should not be looked down upon or
disparaged because they are young. What four? An aristocrat, a serpent,
a fire, and a mendicant. These four things should not be looked down
upon or disparaged because they are young."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "A man should not despise\
> an aristocrat of impeccable lineage,\
> high-born and famous,\
> just because they're young.
>
> For it's possible that that lord of men,\
> as aristocrat, will gain the throne.\
> And in his anger he'll execute a royal punishment,\
> and have you violently beaten.\
> Hence you should avoid him\
> for the sake of your own life.
>
> Whether in village or wilderness,\
> wherever a serpent is seen,\
> a man should not look down on it\
> or despise it for its youth.
>
> With its rainbow of colors,\
> the serpent of fiery breath glides along.\
> It lashes out and bites the fool,\
> both men and women alike.\
> Hence you should avoid it\
> for the sake of your own life.
>
> A fire devours a huge amount,\
> a conflagration with a blackened trail.\
> A man should not look down on it\
> just because it's young.
>
> For once it gets fuel\
> it'll become a huge conflagration.\
> It'll lash out and burn the fool,\
> both men and women alike.\
> Hence you should avoid it\
> for the sake of your own life.
>
> When a forest is burned by fire,\
> a conflagration with a blackened trail,\
> the shoots will spring up there again,\
> with the passing of the days and nights.
>
> But if a mendicant endowed with ethics\
> burns you with their power,\
> you'll have no sons or cattle,\
> nor will your heirs find wealth.\
> Childless and heirless you become,\
> like a palm-tree stump.
>
> That's why an astute person,\
> seeing what's good for themselves,\
> would always treat these properly:\
> a snake, a conflagration,\
> a famous aristocrat,\
> and a mendicant endowed with ethics."

When this was said, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Buddha,
"Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or
revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting
a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what's there, the
Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the
Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From
this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has
gone for refuge for life."

### N 3.2 A Person *Purisasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to
one side, and said to the Buddha, "Sir, how many things arise inside a
person for their harm, suffering, and discomfort?"

"Great king, three things arise inside a person for their harm,
suffering, and discomfort. What three? Greed, hate, and delusion. These
three things arise inside a person for their harm, suffering, and
discomfort."

That is what the Buddha said. ...

> "When greed, hate, and delusion,\
> have arisen inside oneself,\
> they harm a person of wicked heart,\
> as a reed is destroyed by its own fruit."

### N 3.3 Old Age and Death *Jarāmaraṇasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, "Sir, for someone
who has been reborn, is there any exemption from old age and death?"

"Great king, for someone who has been reborn, there's no exemption from
old age and death. Even for well-to-do aristocrats, brahmins, or
householders---rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and
silver, lots of property and assets, and lots of money and grain---when
they're born, there's no exemption from old age and death. Even for
mendicants who are perfected---who have ended the defilements, completed
the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden,
achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued
existence, and are rightly freed through enlightenment---their bodies
are liable to break up and be laid to rest."

That is what the Buddha said. ...

> "Fancy chariots of kings wear out,\
> and even this body gets old.\
> But the truth of the good never gets old---\
> so the good proclaim to the good."

### N 3.4 Loved *Piyasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, "Just now, sir, as
I was in private retreat this thought came to mind. 'Who are those who
love themselves? And who are those who don't love themselves?'

Then it occurred to me: 'Those who do bad things by way of body, speech,
and mind don't love themselves. Even though they may say: "I love
myself", they don't really. Why is that? It's because they treat
themselves like an enemy. That's why they don't love themselves.

Those who do good things by way of body, speech, and mind do love
themselves. Even though they may say: "I don't love myself", they do
really. Why is that? It's because they treat themselves like a loved
one. That's why they do love themselves.'"

"That's so true, great king! That's so true!" said the Buddha. And he
repeated the king's statement, adding:

> "If you knew your self as beloved,\
> you'd not yoke yourself to wickedness.\
> For happiness is not easy to find\
> by someone who does bad deeds.
>
> When you're seized by the terminator\
> as you give up your human life,\
> what can you call your own?\
> What do you take when you go?\
> What goes with you,\
> like a shadow that never leaves?
>
> Both the good and the bad\
> that a mortal does in this life\
> is what they can call their own.\
> That's what they take when they go.\
> That's what goes with them,\
> like a shadow that never leaves.
>
> That's why you should do good,\
> investing in the future life.\
> The good deeds of sentient beings\
> support them in the next world."

### N 3.5 Self-Protected *Attarakkhitasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, "Just now, sir, as
I was in private retreat this thought came to mind. 'Who are those who
protect themselves? And who are those who don't protect themselves?'

Then it occurred to me: 'Those who do bad things by way of body, speech,
and mind don't protect themselves. Even if they're protected by a
company of elephants, cavalry, chariots, or infantry, they still don't
protect themselves. Why is that? Because such protection is exterior,
not interior. That's why they don't protect themselves.

Those who do good things by way of body, speech, and mind do protect
themselves. Even if they're not protected by a company of elephants,
cavalry, chariots, or infantry, they still protect themselves. Why is
that? Because such protection is interior, not exterior. That's why they
do protect themselves.'"

"That's so true, great king! That's so true!" said the Buddha. And he
repeated the king's statement, adding:

> "Restraint of the body is good;\
> restraint of speech is good;\
> restraint of mind is good;\
> everywhere, restraint is good.\
> A sincere person, restrained everywhere,\
> is said to be 'protected'."

### N 3.6 Few *Appakasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, "Just now, sir, as
I was in private retreat this thought came to mind: 'Few are the
sentient beings in the world who, when they obtain luxury possessions,
don't get indulgent and negligent, giving in to greed for sensual
pleasures, and doing the wrong thing by others. There are many more who,
when they obtain luxury possessions, do get indulgent and negligent,
giving in to greed for sensual pleasures, and doing the wrong thing by
others.'"

"That's so true, great king! That's so true!" said the Buddha. And he
repeated the king's statement, adding:

> "Full of desire for possessions and pleasures,\
> greedy, infatuated by sensual pleasures;\
> they don't notice that they've gone too far,\
> like deer falling into a trap set out.\
> It'll be bitter later on;\
> for the result will be bad for them."

### N 3.7 Judgment *Aḍḍakaraṇasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, "Sir, when I'm
sitting in judgment I see well-to-do aristocrats, brahmins, and
householders---rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and
silver, lots of property and assets, and lots of money and grain. But
they tell deliberate lies for the sake of sensual pleasures. Then it
occurred to me: 'Enough with passing judgment today. Now my dearest will
be known by the judgments he makes.'"

"That's so true, great king! That's so true! Those who are well-to-do
aristocrats, brahmins, and householders tell deliberate lies for the
sake of sensual pleasures. That is for their lasting harm and
suffering."

That is what the Buddha said. ...

> "Full of desire for possessions and pleasures,\
> greedy, infatuated by sensual pleasures;\
> they don't notice that they've gone too far,\
> like fish entering a net set out.\
> It'll be bitter later on;\
> for the result will be bad for them."

### N 3.8 With Queen Mallikā *Mallikāsutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala was upstairs in the royal
longhouse together with Queen Mallikā.

Then the king said to the queen, "Mallikā, is there anyone
more dear to you than yourself?"

"No, great king, there isn't. But is there anyone more dear to you than
yourself?"

"For me also, Mallikā, there's no-one."

Then King Pasenadi of Kosala came downstairs from the stilt longhouse,
went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had
happened.

Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha recited
this verse:

> "Having explored every quarter with the mind,\
> one finds no-one dearer than oneself.\
> Likewise for others, each holds themselves dear;\
> so one who cares for their own welfare would harm no other."

### N 3.9 Sacrifice *Yaññasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time a big sacrifice had been set up for King Pasenadi of
Kosala. Bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats and rams---five hundred of
each---had been led to the pillar for the sacrifice. His bondservants,
servants, and workers did their jobs under threat of punishment and
danger, weeping with tearful faces.

Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls
and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. Then, after the meal,
when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed,
sat down to one side, and told him what was happening.

Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha recited
these verses:

> "Horse sacrifice, human sacrifice,\
> the sacrifices of the 'casting of the yoke-pin',\
> the 'royal soma drinking', and the 'unimpeded'---\
> these huge violent sacrifices yield no great fruit.
>
> The great sages of right comportment\
> don't attend sacrifices\
> where goats, sheep, and cattle\
> and various creatures are killed.
>
> But the great sages of right comportment\
> do attend non-violent sacrifices\
> of regular family tradition,\
> where goats, sheep, and cattle,\
> and various creatures aren't killed.
>
> A clever person should sacrifice like this,\
> for this sacrifice is very fruitful.\
> For a sponsor of sacrifices like this,\
> things get better, not worse.\
> Such a sacrifice is truly abundant,\
> and even the deities are pleased."

### N 3.10 Shackles *Bandhanasutta*

Now at that time a large group of people had been put in shackles by
King Pasenadi of Kosala---some in ropes, some in manacles, some in
chains.

Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls
and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. Then, after the meal,
when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed,
sat down to one side, and told him what was happening.

Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha recited
these verses:

> "The attentive say that shackle is not strong\
> that's made of iron, wood, or knots.\
> But obsession with jeweled earrings,\
> concern for your partners and children:
>
> this, say the attentive, is a strong shackle\
> dragging the indulgent down, hard to escape.\
> Having cut this one too they go forth,\
> unconcerned, having given up sensual pleasures."

## Chapter Two

### N 3.11 Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics *Sattajaṭilasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the
stilt longhouse of Migāra's mother in the Eastern
Monastery.

Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and sat
outside the gate. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha,
bowed, and sat down to one side.

Now at that time seven matted-hair ascetics, seven Jain ascetics, seven
naked ascetics, seven one-cloth ascetics, and seven wanderers passed by
not far from the Buddha. Their armpits and bodies were hairy, and their
nails were long; and they carried their stuff with shoulder-poles.

Then King Pasenadi got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one
shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground, raised his joined
palms toward those various ascetics, and pronounced his name three
times: "Sirs, I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala! ... I am Pasenadi, king of
Kosala!"

Then, soon after those ascetics had left, King Pasenadi went up to the
Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, "Sir, are they
among those in the world who are perfected ones or who are on the path
to perfection?"

"Great king, as a layman enjoying sensual pleasures, living at home with
your children, using sandalwood imported from Kāsi, wearing
garlands, fragrance, and makeup, and accepting gold and currency, it's
hard for you to know who is perfected or on the path to perfection.

You can get to know a person's ethics by living with them. But only
after a long time, not casually; only when attentive, not when
inattentive; and only by the wise, not the witless. You can get to know
a person's purity by dealing with them. ... You can get to know a
person's resilience in times of trouble. ... You can get to know a
person's wisdom by discussion. But only after a long time, not casually;
only when attentive, not when inattentive; and only by the wise, not the
witless."

"It's incredible, sir, it's amazing, how well said this was by the
Buddha. ...

Sir, these are my spies, my undercover agents returning after spying on
the country. First they go undercover, then I have them report to me.
And now---when they have washed off the dust and dirt, and are nicely
bathed and anointed, with hair and beard dressed, and dressed in
white---they will amuse themselves, supplied and provided with the five
kinds of sensual stimulation."

Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha recited
these verses:

> "It's not easy to know a man by his appearance.\
> You shouldn't trust them at first sight.\
> For undisciplined men live in this world\
> disguised as the disciplined.
>
> Like a fake earring made of clay,\
> like a copper halfpenny covered with gold,\
> they live hidden in the world,\
> corrupt inside but impressive outside."

### N 3.12 Five Kings *Pañcarājasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time five kings headed by Pasenadi were amusing themselves,
supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, and
this discussion came up among them: "What's the best of sensual
pleasures?"

Some of them said, "Sights are the best of sensual pleasures!"

Others said, "Sounds are best!"

Others said, "Smells are best!"

Others said, "Tastes are best!"

Others said, "Touches are best!"

Since those kings were unable to persuade each other, King Pasenadi said
to them, "Come, good fellows, let's go to the Buddha and ask him about
this. As he answers, so we'll remember it."

"Yes, dear sir," replied those kings.

Then those five kings headed by Pasenadi went to the Buddha, bowed, and
sat down to one side. King Pasenadi reported their conversation to the
Buddha, and said, "Sir, what's the best of sensual pleasures?"

"Great king, which kind of sensual stimulation is best is defined by
which is most agreeable, I say. The very same sights that are agreeable
to some are disagreeable to others. When you're happy with certain
sights, as you've got all you wished for, you don't want any other sight
that's better or finer. For you, those sights are perfect and supreme.

The very same sounds ... smells ... tastes ... touches that are
agreeable to some are disagreeable to others. When you're happy with
certain touches, as you've got all you wished for, you don't want any
other touch that's better or finer. For you, those touches are perfect
and supreme."

Now at that time the lay follower Candanaṅgalika was
sitting in that assembly. Then he got up from his seat, arranged his
robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and
said, "I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak,
Holy One!"

"Then speak as you feel inspired," said the Buddha.

Then the lay follower Candanaṅgalika extolled the Buddha in
his presence with an appropriate verse:

> "Like a fragrant pink lotus\
> that blooms in the morning, its fragrance unfaded---\
> see Aṅgīrasa shine,\
> bright as the sun in the sky!"

Then those five kings clothed Candanaṅgalika with five
upper robes. And Candanaṅgalika in turn endowed the Buddha
with those robes.

### N 3.13 A Bucket of Rice *Doṇapākasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala used to eat rice by the pot.
Then after eating King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, huffing
and puffing. He bowed and sat down to one side.

Then, knowing that King Pasenadi was huffing and puffing after eating,
on that occasion the Buddha recited this verse:

> "When a man is always mindful,\
> knowing moderation in eating,\
> his discomfort fades,\
> and he ages slowly, taking care of his life."

Now at that time the student Sudassana was standing behind the king.
Then King Pasenadi addressed him, "Please, dear Sudassana, memorize this
verse in the Buddha's presence and recite it to me whenever I am
presented with a meal. I'll set up a regular daily allowance of a
hundred dollars for you."

"Yes, Your Majesty," replied Sudassana. He memorized that verse in the
Buddha's presence, and then whenever the king was presented with a meal
he would repeat it:

> "When a man is always mindful,\
> knowing moderation in eating,\
> his discomfort fades,\
> and he ages slowly, taking care of his life."

Then the king gradually got used to having at most a cup of rice. After
some time King Pasenadi's body slimmed right down. Stroking his limbs
with his hands, at that time he expressed this heartfelt sentiment:

"In both ways the Buddha has sympathy for me: in the good of this life
and the good of the next."

### N 3.14 Battle (1st) *Paṭhamasaṅgāmasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of
Videha, mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to
Kāsi to attack King Pasenadi of Kosala. When King Pasenadi
heard of this, he mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to
Kāsi to defend it against Ajātasattu. Then the
two kings met in battle. And in that battle Ajātasattu
defeated Pasenadi, who withdrew to his own capital at
Sāvatthī.

Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls
and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. Then, after the meal,
when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed,
sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then the Buddha
said:

"Mendicants, King Ajātasattu has bad friends, companions,
and associates. But King Pasenadi has good friends, companions, and
associates. Yet on this day King Pasenadi will have a bad night's sleep
as one defeated."

That is what the Buddha said. ...

> "Victory breeds enmity;\
> the defeated sleep badly.\
> The peaceful sleep at ease,\
> having left victory and defeat behind."

### N 3.15 Battle (2nd) *Dutiyasaṅgāmasutta*

Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of
Videha, mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to
Kāsi to attack King Pasenadi of Kosala. When King Pasenadi
heard of this, he mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to
Kāsi to defend it against Ajātasattu. Then the
two kings met in battle. And in that battle Pasenadi defeated
Ajātasattu and captured him alive.

Then King Pasenadi thought, "Even though I've never betrayed this King
Ajātasattu, he betrayed me. Still, he is my nephew. Now
that I've vanquished all of Ajātasattu's elephant troops,
cavalry, chariots, and infantry, why don't I let him loose with just his
life?"

And that's what he did.

Then several mendicants ... told the Buddha what had happened.

Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha recited
these verses:

> "A man goes on plundering\
> as long as it serves his ends.\
> But as soon as others plunder him,\
> the plunderer is plundered.
>
> For the fool thinks they've got away with it\
> so long as their wickedness has not ripened.\
> But as soon as that wickedness ripens,\
> they fall into suffering.
>
> A killer creates a killer;\
> a conqueror creates a conqueror;\
> an abuser creates abuse,\
> and a bully creates a bully.\
> And so as deeds unfold\
> the plunderer is plundered."

### N 3.16 A Daughter *Mallikāsutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down
to one side. Then a man went up to the king and whispered in his ear,
"Your Majesty, Queen Mallikā has given birth to a
daughter." When this was said, King Pasenadi was disappointed.

Then, knowing that King Pasenadi was disappointed, on that occasion the
Buddha recited these verses:

> "Well, some women are better than men,\
> O ruler of the people.\
> Wise and virtuous,\
> a devoted wife who honors her mother in law.
>
> And when she has a son,\
> he becomes a hero, O lord of the land.\
> The son of such a blessed lady\
> may even rule the realm."

### N 3.17 Diligence *Appamādasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, "Sir, is there one
thing that secures benefits for both this life and lives to come?"

"There is, great king."

"So what is that one thing?"

"Diligence, great king, is one thing that secures benefits for both this
life and lives to come. The footprints of all creatures that walk can
fit inside an elephant's footprint. So an elephant's footprint is said
to be the biggest of them all. In the same way, diligence is one thing
that secures benefits for both this life and lives to come."

That is what the Buddha said. ...

> "For one who desires a continuous flow\
> of exceptional delights---\
> long life, beauty, and health,\
> heaven, and birth in an eminent family---
>
> the astute praise diligence\
> in making merit.\
> Being diligent, an astute person\
> secures both benefits:
>
> the benefit in this life,\
> and in lives to come.\
> An attentive one, comprehending the meaning,\
> is said to be astute."

### N 3.18 Good Friends *Kalyāṇamittasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, "Just now, sir, as
I was in private retreat this thought came to mind. 'The teaching is
well explained by the Buddha. But it's for someone with good friends,
companions, and associates, not for someone with bad friends,
companions, and associates.'"

"That's so true, great king! That's so true!" said the Buddha. And he
repeated the king's statement, adding:

"Great king, this one time I was staying in the land of the Sakyans
where they have a town named Townsville. Then the mendicant Ānanda came
to me, bowed, sat down to one side, and said: 'Sir, good friends,
companions, and associates are half the spiritual life.'

When he had spoken, I said to him: 'Not so, Ānanda! Not so, Ānanda! Good
friends, companions, and associates are the whole of the spiritual life.
A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to
develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path.

And how does a mendicant with good friends develop and cultivate the
noble eightfold path? It's when a mendicant develops right view, right
thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort,
right mindfulness, and right immersion, which rely on seclusion, fading
away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. That's how a mendicant
with good friends develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path. And
here's another way to understand how good friends are the whole of the
spiritual life.

For, by relying on me as a good friend, sentient beings who are liable
to rebirth, old age, and death, to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness,
and distress are freed from all these things. This is another way to
understand how good friends are the whole of the spiritual life.'

So, great king, you should train like this: 'I will have good friends,
companions, and associates.' That's how you should train.

When you have good friends, companions, and associates, you should live
supported by one thing: diligence in skillful qualities.

When you're diligent, supported by diligence, your ladies of the harem,
aristocrat vassals, troops, and people of town and country will think:
'The king lives diligently, supported by diligence. We'd better live
diligently, supported by diligence!'

When you're diligent, supported by diligence, then not only you
yourself, but your ladies of the harem, and your treasury and
storehouses will be guarded and protected."

That is what the Buddha said. ...

> "For one who desires a continuous flow\
> of exceptional wealth,\
> the astute praise diligence\
> in making merit.\
> Being diligent, an astute person\
> secures both benefits:
>
> the benefit in this life,\
> and in lives to come.\
> Attentive, comprehending the meaning,\
> they are said to be astute."

### N 3.19 Childless (1st) *Paṭhamaaputtakasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha in the middle of the
day, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, "So, great
king, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?"

"Sir, here in Sāvatthī a financier householder has passed
away. Since he died childless, I have come after transferring his
fortune to the royal compound. There was eight million in gold coin, not
to mention the silver coin. And yet that financier ate meals of rough
gruel with pickles. He wore clothes consisting of three pieces of sunn
hemp. He traveled around in a vehicle that was a dilapidated little
cart, holding a leaf as sunshade."

"That's so true, great king! That's so true! When an untrue person has
acquired exceptional wealth they don't make themselves happy and
pleased. Nor do they make their mother and father, partners and
children, bondservants, workers, and staff, and friends and colleagues
happy and pleased. And they don't establish an uplifting religious
donation for ascetics and brahmins that's conducive to heaven, ripens in
happiness, and leads to heaven. Because they haven't made proper use of
that wealth, rulers or bandits take it, or fire consumes it, or flood
sweeps it away, or unloved heirs take it. Since that wealth is not
properly utilized, it's wasted, not used.

Suppose there was a lotus pond in an uninhabited region with clear,
sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful. But people
don't collect it or drink it or bathe in it or use it for any purpose.
Since that water is not properly utilized, it's wasted, not used.

In the same way, when an untrue person has acquired exceptional wealth
... it's wasted, not used.

When a true person has acquired exceptional wealth they make themselves
happy and pleased. And they make their mother and father, partners and
children, bondservants, workers, and staff, and friends and colleagues
happy and pleased. And they establish an uplifting religious donation
for ascetics and brahmins that's conducive to heaven, ripens in
happiness, and leads to heaven. Because they make proper use of that
wealth, rulers or bandits don't take it, fire doesn't consume it, flood
doesn't sweep it away, and unloved heirs don't take it. Since that
wealth is properly utilized, it's used, not wasted.

Suppose there was a lotus pond not far from a town or village with
clear, sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful. And
people collected it and drank it and bathed in it and used it for their
own purpose. Since that water is properly utilized, it's used, not
wasted.

In the same way, when a true person has acquired exceptional wealth ...
it's used, not wasted.

> As cool water in an uninhabited region\
> evaporates when not drunk;\
> so too when a sinner acquires wealth,\
> they neither use it themselves nor give it away.
>
> But when an attentive and sensible person gets hold of wealth,\
> they use it and do their duty.\
> That head, having supported the family unit,\
> blameless, goes to a heavenly place."

### N 3.20 Childless (2nd) *Dutiyaaputtakasutta*

Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha in the middle of the
day ... The Buddha said to him, "So, great king, where are you coming
from in the middle of the day?"

"Sir, here in Sāvatthī a financier householder has passed
away. Since he died childless, I have come after transferring his
fortune to the royal compound. There was ten million in gold coin, not
to mention the silver coin. And yet that financier ate meals of rough
gruel with pickles. He wore clothes consisting of three pieces of sunn
hemp. He traveled around in a vehicle that was a dilapidated little
cart, holding a leaf as sunshade."

"That's so true, great king! That's so true! Once upon a time, great
king, that financier householder provided almsfood on behalf of an
independent Buddha named Tagarasikhī. He instructed: 'Give
alms to that ascetic,' before getting up from his seat and leaving. But
after giving he regretted it: 'It would have been better to feed the
bondservants or workers with that almsfood.' What's more, he murdered
his brother's only child for the sake of his fortune.

Because that financier provided Tagarasikhī with almsfood,
as a result of that deed he was reborn seven times in a good place, a
heavenly realm. And as a residual result of that same deed he held the
position of financier seven times right here in Sāvatthī.
But because that financier regretted giving alms, as a result of that
deed his mind didn't tend to enjoy nice food, clothes, vehicles, or the
five refined kinds of sensual stimulation. And because that financier
murdered his brother's only child for the sake of his fortune, as a
result of that deed he burned in hell for many years, for many hundreds,
many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of years. And as a residual
result of that same deed, he is childless for the seventh time, his
fortune ending up in the royal treasury. Now the old merit of that
financier has been used up, and he hasn't accumulated new merit. Today,
great king, that financier burns in the Great Hell of Screams."

"Really, sir, that financier has been reborn in the Great Hell of
Screams?"

"Yes he has, great king."

That is what the Buddha said. ...

> "Grain, money, silver, and gold,\
> or whatever other possessions there are;\
> bondservants, workers, servants,\
> and those dependent for their livelihood:
>
> you must go on without taking these;\
> all of them are left behind.\
> But the deeds you do\
> by body, speech, and mind---
>
> that's what you can call your own.\
> That's what you take when you go.\
> That's what goes with you,\
> like a shadow that never leaves.
>
> That's why you should do good,\
> investing in the future life.\
> The good deeds of sentient beings\
> support them in the next world."

## Chapter Three

### N 3.21 Persons *Puggalasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down
to one side. The Buddha said to him:

"Great king, these four people are found in the world. What four?

1.  The dark bound for darkness,

2.  the dark bound for light,

3.  the light bound for darkness,

4.  and the light bound for light.

And how is a person dark and bound for darkness? It's when a person is
reborn in a low family---a family of corpse-workers, bamboo-workers,
hunters, chariot-makers, or scavengers---poor, with little to eat or
drink, where life is tough, and food and shelter are hard to find. And
they're ugly, unsightly, deformed, sickly---one-eyed, crippled, lame, or
half-paralyzed. They don't get to have food, drink, clothes, and
vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; or bed, house, and lighting.
And they do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body
breaks up, after death, they're reborn in a place of loss, a bad place,
the underworld, hell.

This person is like someone who goes from darkness to darkness, from
blackness to blackness, from bloodstain to bloodstain. That's how a
person is dark and bound for darkness.

And how is a person dark and bound for light? It's when a person is
reborn in a low family---a family of corpse-workers, bamboo-workers,
hunters, chariot-makers, or scavengers---poor, with little to eat or
drink, where life is tough, and food and shelter are hard to find. And
they're ugly, unsightly, deformed, sickly---one-eyed, crippled, lame, or
half-paralyzed. They don't get to have food, drink, clothes, and
vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; or bed, house, and lighting.
But they do good things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their
body breaks up, after death, they're reborn in a good place, a heavenly
realm.

This person is like someone who ascends from the ground to a couch; from
a couch to horseback; from horseback to an elephant; and from an
elephant to a stilt longhouse. That's how a person is dark and bound for
light.

And how is a person light and bound for darkness? It's when a person is
reborn in an eminent family---a well-to-do family of aristocrats,
brahmins, or householders---rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of
gold and silver, lots of property and assets, and lots of money and
grain. And they're attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing
beauty. They get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands,
fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. But they do bad
things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body breaks up,
after death, they're reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the
underworld, hell.

This person is like someone who descends from a stilt longhouse to an
elephant; from an elephant to horseback; from horseback to a couch; and
from a couch to the ground; and from the ground they enter darkness.
That's how a person is light and bound for darkness.

And how is a person light and bound for light? It's when a person is
reborn in an eminent family---a well-to-do family of aristocrats,
brahmins, or householders---rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of
gold and silver, lots of property and assets, and lots of money and
grain. And they're attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing
beauty. They get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands,
fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. And they do good
things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body breaks up,
after death, they're reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.

This person is like someone who shifts from one couch to another; from
the back of one horse to another; from one elephant to another; or from
one stilt longhouse to another. That's how a person is light and bound
for light. These are the four people found in the world."

That is what the Buddha said. ...

> "O king, some people are poor,\
> faithless and stingy.\
> Miserly, with bad intentions,\
> they lack regard, they have wrong view.
>
> They abuse and insult\
> ascetics and brahmins\
> and other supplicants.\
> They're nihilists and bullies,
>
> who prevent others from giving\
> food to beggars.\
> O king, ruler of the people:\
> when such people die\
> they fall into the terrible hell---\
> from darkness they're bound for darkness.
>
> O king, some people are poor,\
> but faithful and not stingy.\
> They give with best of intentions,\
> that peaceful-hearted person.
>
> They rise for and bow to\
> ascetics and brahmins\
> and other supplicants.\
> Training in moral conduct,
>
> they don't prevent others from giving\
> food to beggars.\
> O king, ruler of the people:\
> when such people die\
> they go to the heaven of the Three and Thirty---\
> from darkness they're bound for light.
>

### N 3.22 Grandmother *Ayyikāsutta*

At Sāvatthī.

King Pasenadi of Kosala sat to one side, and the Buddha said to him,
"So, great king, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?"

"Sir, my grandmother has passed away. She was old, elderly and senior.
She was advanced in years and had reached the final stage of life; she
was a hundred and twenty years old. But I loved my grandmother; she was
dear to me. If by giving away the elephant-treasure I could get my
grandmother back, I'd do it. If by giving away the horse-treasure I
could get my grandmother back, I'd do it. If by giving away a prize
village I could get my grandmother back, I'd do it. If by giving away
the whole country I could get my grandmother back, I'd do it."

"Great king, all sentient beings are liable to die. Death is their end;
they're not exempt from death."

"It's incredible, sir, it's amazing, how well said this was by the
Buddha: 'All sentient beings are liable to die. Death is their end;
they're not exempt from death.'"

"That's so true, great king! That's so true! All sentient beings are
liable to die. Death is their end; they're not exempt from death. It's
like the vessels made by potters. Whatever kind they are, whether baked
or unbaked, all of them are liable to break apart. Breaking is their
end; they're not exempt from breakage. In the same way, all sentient
beings are liable to die. Death is their end; they're not exempt from
death."

That is what the Buddha said. ...

> "All beings will die,\
> for life ends in death.\
> They pass on according to their deeds,\
> reaping the fruits of good and bad.\
> Those who do bad go to hell,\
> and if you do good you go to heaven.
>
> That's why you should do good,\
> investing in the future life.\
> The good deeds of sentient beings\
> support them in the next world."

### N 3.23 The World *Lokasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, "Sir, how many
things arise in the world for its harm, suffering, and discomfort?"

"Great king, three things arise in the world for its harm, suffering,
and discomfort. What three? Greed, hate, and delusion. These three
things arise in the world for its harm, suffering, and discomfort."

That is what the Buddha said. ...

> "When greed, hate, and delusion,\
> have arisen inside oneself,\
> they harm a person of wicked heart,\
> as a reed is destroyed by its own fruit."

### N 3.24 Archery *Issattasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, "Sir, where should
a gift be given?"

"Wherever your heart feels inspired, great king."

"But sir, where is a gift very fruitful?"

"Where a gift should be given is one thing, great king, but where a gift
is very fruitful is another. A gift is very fruitful when it's given to
an ethical person, not so much to an unethical person. Well then, great
king, I'll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.

What do you think, great king? Suppose you were at war, ready to fight a
battle. Then along comes an aristocrat youth who is untrained, inexpert,
unfit, inexperienced. And he's fearful, scared, nervous, quick to flee.
Would you employ such a man? Would he be of any use to you?"

"No, sir, I would have no use for such a man."

"What about a brahmin youth, a peasant youth, or a menial youth who was
similar?"

"No, sir, I would have no use for such a man."

"What do you think, great king? Suppose you were at war, ready to fight
a battle. Then along comes an aristocrat youth who is trained, expert,
fit, experienced. And he's fearless, brave, bold, standing his ground.
Would you employ such a man? Would he be of any use to you?"

"Yes, sir, I would have a use for such a man."

"What about a brahmin youth, a peasant youth, or a menial youth who was
similar? Would you employ such a man? Would he be of any use to you?"

"Yes, sir, I would have a use for such a man."

"In the same way, a gift to anyone who has given up five factors and
possesses five factors is very fruitful, no matter what family they've
gone forth from.

What are the five factors they've given up? Sensual desire, ill will,
dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. These are
the five factors they've given up.

What are the five factors they possess? The entire spectrum of an
adept's ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and knowledge and vision of
freedom. These are the five factors they possess.

I say that a gift to anyone who has given up these five factors and
possesses these five factors is very fruitful."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "Any youth skilled at archery,\
> powerful and vigorous,\
> would be employed by a king going to war---\
> one is not a coward by reason of birth.
>
> Just so, whoever is settled\
> in the qualities of patience and gentleness,\
> a clever person with noble conduct,\
> should be venerated even if they're low born.
>
> You should build lovely hermitages\
> and settle learned people in them.\
> You should set up water supplies in barren regions\
> and passages in places hard to travel.
>
> Food, drink, edibles,\
> clothes, and lodgings\
> should be given to the sincere ones,\
> with a clear and confident heart.
>
> The thundering rain cloud,\
> its hundred peaks wreathed in lightning,\
> pours down over the rich earth,\
> soaking the uplands and valleys.
>
> So too an astute person,\
> faithful and learned,\
> should prepare a meal to satisfy\
> supplicants with food and drink.
>
> Rejoicing, they strew gifts about,\
> crying 'Give! give!'\
> For that is their thunder,\
> like rain sent from the heavens.\
> That stream of merit so abundant\
> showers down on the giver."

### N 3.25 The Simile of the Mountain *Pabbatūpamasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

King Pasenadi of Kosala sat to one side, and the Buddha said to him,
"So, great king, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?"

"Sir, there are anointed aristocratic kings who are infatuated with
authority, and obsessed with greed for sensual pleasures. They have
attained stability in the country, occupying a vast conquered territory.
Today I have been busy fulfilling the duties of such kings."

"What do you think, great king? Suppose a trustworthy and dependable man
were to come from the east. He'd approach you and say: 'Please great
king, you should know this. I come from the east. There I saw a huge
mountain that reached the clouds. And it was coming this way, crushing
all creatures. So then, great king, do what you must!'

Then a second trustworthy and dependable man were to come from the west
... a third from the north ... and a fourth from the south. He'd
approach you and say: 'Please great king, you should know this. I come
from the south. There I saw a huge mountain that reached the clouds. And
it was coming this way, crushing all creatures. So then, great king, do
what you must!'

Should such a dire threat arise---a terrible loss of human life, when
human birth is so rare---what would you do?"

"Sir, what could I do but practice the teachings, practice morality,
doing skillful and good actions?"

"I tell you, great king, I announce to you: old age and death are
advancing upon you. Since old age and death are advancing upon you, what
would you do?"

"Sir, what can I do but practice the teachings, practice morality, doing
skillful and good actions?

Sir, there are anointed aristocratic kings who are infatuated with
authority, and obsessed with greed for sensual pleasures. They have
attained stability in the country, occupying a vast conquered territory.
Such kings engage in battles of elephants, cavalry, chariots, or
infantry. But there is no place, no domain for such battles when old age
and death are advancing.

In this royal court there are ministers of wise counsel who are capable
of dividing an approaching enemy by wise counsel. But there is no place,
no domain for such diplomatic battles when old age and death are
advancing.

In this royal court there is abundant gold, both coined and uncoined,
stored in dungeons and towers. Using this wealth we can bribe an
approaching enemy. But there is no place, no domain for such monetary
battles when old age and death are advancing.

When old age and death are advancing, what can I do but practice the
teachings, practice morality, doing skillful and good actions?"

"That's so true, great king! That's so true! When old age and death are
advancing, what can you do but practice the teachings, practice
morality, doing skillful and good actions?"

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "Suppose there were vast mountains\
> of solid rock pushing the sky\
> drawing in from all sides\
> and crushing the four quarters.
>
> So too old age and death\
> advance upon all living creatures---\
> aristocrats, brahmins, peasants,\
> menials, corpse-workers, and scavengers.\
> They spare nothing.\
> They crush all beneath them.
>
> There's nowhere for elephants to take a stand,\
> nor chariots nor infantry.\
> They can't be defeated\
> by diplomatic battles or by wealth.
>
> That's why an astute person,\
> seeing what's good for themselves,\
> being wise, would place faith\
> in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.
>
> Whoever lives by the teaching\
> in body, speech, and mind,\
> is praised in this life\
> and departs to rejoice in heaven."
