## The Chapter with Sāriputta

### N 28.1 Born of Seclusion *Vivekajasutta*

At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning
and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.
He wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his
return from almsround, he went to the Dark Forest for the day's
meditation, plunged deep into it, and sat at the root of a tree to
meditate.

Then in the late afternoon, Sāriputta came out of retreat
and went to Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.
Venerable Ānanda saw him coming off in the distance, and said to him:

"Reverend Sāriputta, your faculties are so very clear, and
your complexion is pure and bright. What meditation were you practicing
today?"

"Reverend, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption,
which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the
mind and keeping it connected. But it didn't occur to me: 'I am entering
the first absorption' or 'I have entered the first absorption' or 'I am
emerging from the first absorption'."

"That must be because Venerable Sāriputta has long ago
totally eradicated I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendency to
conceit. That's why it didn't occur to you: 'I am entering the first
absorption' or 'I have entered the first absorption' or 'I am emerging
from the first absorption'."

### N 28.2 Without Placing the Mind *Avitakkasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Venerable Ānanda saw Venerable Sāriputta and said to him:

"Reverend Sāriputta, your faculties are so very clear, and
your complexion is pure and bright. What meditation were you practicing
today?"

"Reverend, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were
stilled, I entered and remained in the second absorption, which has the
rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at
one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. But it didn't
occur to me: 'I am entering the second absorption' or 'I have entered
the second absorption' or 'I am emerging from the second absorption'."

"That must be because Venerable Sāriputta has long ago
totally eradicated I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendency to
conceit. That's why it didn't occur to you: 'I am entering the second
absorption' or 'I have entered the second absorption' or 'I am emerging
from the second absorption'."

### N 28.3 Rapture *Pītisutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Venerable Ānanda saw Venerable Sāriputta and said to him:

"Reverend Sāriputta, your faculties are so very clear, and
your complexion is pure and bright. What meditation were you practicing
today?"

"Reverend, with the fading away of rapture, I entered and remained in
the third absorption, where I meditated with equanimity, mindful and
aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones
declare, 'Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.' But it didn't
occur to me: 'I am entering the third absorption' or 'I have entered the
third absorption' or 'I am emerging from the third absorption'."

"That must be because Venerable Sāriputta has long ago
totally eradicated I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendency to
conceit. That's why it didn't occur to you: 'I am entering the third
absorption' or 'I have entered the third absorption' or 'I am emerging
from the third absorption'."

### N 28.4 Equanimity *Upekkhāsutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Venerable Ānanda saw Venerable Sāriputta and said to him:

"Reverend Sāriputta, your faculties are so very clear, and
your complexion is pure and bright. What meditation were you practicing
today?"

"Reverend, with the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of
former happiness and sadness, I entered and remained in the fourth
absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and
mindfulness. But it didn't occur to me: 'I am entering the fourth
absorption' or 'I have entered the fourth absorption' or 'I am emerging
from the fourth absorption'."

"That must be because Venerable Sāriputta has long ago
totally eradicated I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendency to
conceit. That's why it didn't occur to you: 'I am entering the fourth
absorption' or 'I have entered the fourth absorption' or 'I am emerging
from the fourth absorption'."

### N 28.5 The Dimension of Infinite Space *Ākāsānañcāyatanasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Venerable Ānanda saw Venerable Sāriputta ...

non-perception, I entered and remained in the cessation of perception
and feeling. But it didn't occur to me: 'I am entering the cessation of
perception and feeling' or 'I have entered the cessation of perception
and feeling' or 'I am emerging from the cessation of perception and
feeling'."

"That must be because Venerable Sāriputta has long ago
totally eradicated I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendency to
conceit. That's why it didn't occur to you: 'I am entering the cessation
of perception and feeling' or 'I have entered the cessation of
perception and feeling' or 'I am emerging from the cessation of
perception and feeling'."

### N 28.10 With Sucimukhī *Sucimukhīsutta*

At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near
Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding
ground. Then he robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
entered Rājagaha for alms. After wandering indiscriminately
for almsfood in Rājagaha, he ate his almsfood by a wall.

Then the wanderer Sucimukhī went up to Venerable
Sāriputta and said to him:

"Ascetic, do you eat facing downwards?"

"No, sister."

"Well then, do you eat facing upwards?"

"No, sister."

"Well then, do you eat facing the cardinal directions?"

"No, sister."

"Well then, do you eat facing the intermediate directions?"

"No, sister."

"When asked if you eat facing all these directions, you answer 'no,
sister'. How exactly do you eat, ascetic?"

"Sister, those ascetics and brahmins who earn a living by geomancy---a
low lore, a wrong livelihood---are said to eat facing downwards.

Those ascetics and brahmins who earn a living by astrology---a low lore,
a wrong livelihood---are said to eat facing upwards.

Those ascetics and brahmins who earn a living by running errands and
messages---a wrong livelihood---are said to eat facing the cardinal
directions.

Those ascetics and brahmins who earn a living by palmistry---a low lore,
a wrong livelihood---are said to eat facing the intermediate directions.

I don't earn a living by any of these means. I seek alms in a principled
manner, and I eat it in a principled manner."

Then Sucimukhī the wanderer went around
Rājagaha from street to street and from square to square,
and announced: "The ascetics who follow the Sakyan eat food in a
principled manner! The ascetics who follow the Sakyan eat food
blamelessly! Give almsfood to the ascetics who follow the Sakyan!"
