# Linked Discourses on Causation

## The Chapter on the Buddhas

### N 12.1 Dependent Origination *Paṭiccasamuppādasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, I will teach you dependent origination. Listen and apply
your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"And what is dependent origination? Ignorance is a condition for
choices. Choices are a condition for consciousness. Consciousness is a
condition for name and form. Name and form are conditions for the six
sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. Contact
is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. Craving
is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued
existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a
condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and
distress to come to be. That is how this entire mass of suffering
originates. This is called dependent origination.

When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices
cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness
ceases, name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six sense
fields cease. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. When
contact ceases, feeling ceases. When feeling ceases, craving ceases.
When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued
existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When
rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness,
and distress cease. That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases."

That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants approved what
the Buddha said.

### N 12.2 Analysis *Vibhaṅgasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, I will teach and analyze for you dependent origination.
Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"And what is dependent origination? Ignorance is a condition for
choices. Choices are a condition for consciousness. Consciousness is a
condition for name and form. Name and form are conditions for the six
sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. Contact
is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. Craving
is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued
existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a
condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and
distress to come to be. That is how this entire mass of suffering
originates.

And what is old age and death? The old age, decrepitude, broken teeth,
grey hair, wrinkly skin, diminished vitality, and failing faculties of
the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings.
This is called old age. The passing away, passing on, disintegration,
demise, mortality, death, decease, breaking up of the aggregates, and
laying to rest of the corpse of the various sentient beings in the
various orders of sentient beings. This is called death. Such is old
age, and such is death. This is called old age and death.

And what is rebirth? The rebirth, inception, conception, reincarnation,
manifestation of the aggregates, and acquisition of the sense fields of
the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings.
This is called rebirth.

And what is continued existence? There are these three states of
existence. Existence in the sensual realm, the realm of luminous form,
and the formless realm. This is called continued existence.

And what is grasping? There are these four kinds of grasping. Grasping
at sensual pleasures, views, precepts and observances, and theories of a
self. This is called grasping.

And what is craving? There are these six classes of craving. Craving for
sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and ideas. This is called
craving.

And what is feeling? There are these six classes of feeling. Feeling
born of contact through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. This
is called feeling.

And what is contact? There are these six classes of contact. Contact
through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. This is called
contact.

And what are the six sense fields? The sense fields of the eye, ear,
nose, tongue, body, and mind. These are called the six sense fields.

And what are name and form? Feeling, perception, intention, contact, and
application of mind. This is called name. The four principal states, and
form derived from the four principal states. This is called form. Such
is name and such is form. These are called name and form.

And what is consciousness? There are these six classes of consciousness.
Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind consciousness. This is called
consciousness.

And what are choices? There are three kinds of choices. Choices by way
of body, speech, and mind. These are called choices.

And what is ignorance? Not knowing about suffering, the origin of
suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to
the cessation of suffering. This is called ignorance.

And so, ignorance is a condition for choices.

Choices are a condition for consciousness. ... That is how this entire
mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with
nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness
ceases. ... That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases."

### N 12.3 Practice *Paṭipadāsutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, I will teach you the wrong practice and the right practice.
Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"And what's the wrong practice? Ignorance is a condition for choices.

Choices are a condition for consciousness. ... That is how this entire
mass of suffering originates. This is called the wrong practice.

And what's the right practice? When ignorance fades away and ceases with
nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness
ceases. ... That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases. This is
called the right practice."

### N 12.4 About Vipassī *Vipassīsutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, Vipassī the Blessed One, the perfected one,
the fully awakened Buddha had this thought before his awakening, when he
was still unawakened but intent on awakening: 'Alas, this world has
fallen into trouble. It's born, grows old, dies, passes away, and is
reborn, yet it doesn't understand how to escape from this suffering,
from old age and death. Oh, when will an escape be found from this
suffering, from old age and death?'

Then Vipassī, the one intent on awakening, thought: 'When
what exists is there old age and death? What is a condition for old age
and death?' Then, through rational application of mind,
Vipassī comprehended with wisdom: 'When rebirth exists
there's old age and death. Rebirth is a condition for old age and
death.'

Then Vipassī thought: 'When what exists is there rebirth?
What is a condition for rebirth?' Then, through rational application of
mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom: 'When continued
existence exists there's rebirth. Continued existence is a condition for
rebirth.'

Then Vipassī thought: 'When what exists is there continued
existence? What is a condition for continued existence?' Then, through
rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with
wisdom: 'When grasping exists there's continued existence. Grasping is a
condition for continued existence.'

Then Vipassī thought: 'When what exists is there grasping?
What is a condition for grasping?' Then, through rational application of
mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom: 'When craving
exists there's grasping. Craving is a condition for grasping.'

Then Vipassī thought: 'When what exists is there craving?
What is a condition for craving?' Then, through rational application of
mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom: 'When feeling
exists there's craving. Feeling is a condition for craving.'

Then Vipassī thought: 'When what exists is there feeling?
What is a condition for feeling?' Then, through rational application of
mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom: 'When contact
exists there's feeling. Contact is a condition for feeling.'

Then Vipassī thought: 'When what exists is there contact?
What is a condition for contact?' Then, through rational application of
mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom: 'When the six sense
fields exist there's contact. The six sense fields are a condition for
contact.'

Then Vipassī thought: 'When what exists are there the six
sense fields? What is a condition for the six sense fields?' Then,
through rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended
with wisdom: 'When name and form exist there are the six sense fields.
Name and form are a condition for the six sense fields.'

Then Vipassī thought: 'When what exists are there name and
form? What is a condition for name and form?' Then, through rational
application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom:
'When consciousness exists there are name and form. Consciousness is a
condition for name and form.'

Then Vipassī thought: 'When what exists is there
consciousness? What is a condition for consciousness?' Then, through
rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with
wisdom: 'When choices exist there's consciousness. Choices are a
condition for consciousness.'

Then Vipassī thought: 'When what exists are there choices?
What is a condition for choices?' Then, through rational application of
mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom: 'When ignorance
exists there are choices. Ignorance is a condition for choices.'

And so, ignorance is a condition for choices.

Choices are a condition for consciousness. ... That is how this entire
mass of suffering originates. 'Origination, origination.' While
Vipassī was intent on awakening, such was the vision,
knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in him regarding
teachings not learned before from another.

Then Vipassī thought: 'When what doesn't exist is there no
old age and death? When what ceases do old age and death cease?' Then,
through rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended
with wisdom: 'When rebirth doesn't exist there's no old age and death.
When rebirth ceases, old age and death cease.'

Then Vipassī thought: 'When what doesn't exist is there no
rebirth? When what ceases does rebirth cease?' Then, through rational
application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom:
'When continued existence doesn't exist there's no rebirth. When
continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases.'

Then Vipassī thought: 'When what doesn't exist is there no
continued existence? When what ceases does continued existence cease?'
Then, through rational application of mind, Vipassī
comprehended with wisdom: 'When grasping doesn't exist there's no
continued existence. When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases.'

Then Vipassī thought: 'When what doesn't exist is there no
grasping? When what ceases does grasping cease?' Then, through rational
application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom:
'When craving doesn't exist there's no grasping. When craving ceases,
grasping ceases.'

Then Vipassī thought: 'When what doesn't exist is there no
craving? When what ceases does craving cease?' Then, through rational
application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom:
'When feeling doesn't exist there's no craving. When feeling ceases,
craving ceases.'

Then Vipassī thought: 'When what doesn't exist is there no
feeling? When what ceases does feeling cease?' Then, through rational
application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom:
'When contact doesn't exist there's no feeling. When contact ceases,
feeling ceases.'

Then Vipassī thought: 'When what doesn't exist is there no
contact? When what ceases does contact cease?' Then, through rational
application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom:
'When the six sense fields don't exist there's no contact. When the six
sense fields cease, contact ceases.'

Then Vipassī thought: 'When what doesn't exist are there no
six sense fields? When what ceases do the six sense fields cease?' Then,
through rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended
with wisdom: 'When name and form don't exist there are no six sense
fields. When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease.'

Then Vipassī thought: 'When what doesn't exist are there no
name and form? When what ceases do name and form cease?' Then, through
rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with
wisdom: 'When consciousness doesn't exist there are no name and form.
When consciousness ceases, name and form cease.'

Then Vipassī thought: 'When what doesn't exist is there no
consciousness? When what ceases does consciousness cease?' Then, through
rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with
wisdom: 'When choices don't exist there's no consciousness. When choices
cease, consciousness ceases.'

Then Vipassī thought: 'When what doesn't exist are there no
choices? When what ceases do choices cease?' Then, through rational
application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom:
'When ignorance doesn't exist there are no choices. When ignorance
ceases, choices cease.'

And so, when ignorance ceases, choices cease. When choices cease,
consciousness ceases. ... That is how this entire mass of suffering
ceases. 'Cessation, cessation.' Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom,
realization, and light that arose in Vipassī, the one
intent on awakening, regarding teachings not learned before from
another."

### N 12.5 Sikhī *Sikhīsutta*

"Sikhī, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully
awakened Buddha ..."

"Vessabhū, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully
awakened Buddha ..."

### N 12.10 Gotama *Gotamasutta*

"Mendicants, before my awakening---when I was still unawakened but
intent on awakening---I thought: 'Alas, this world has fallen into
trouble. It's born, grows old, dies, passes away, and is reborn, yet it
doesn't understand how to escape from this suffering, from old age and
death. Oh, when will an escape be found from this suffering, from old
age and death?'

Then it occurred to me: 'When what exists is there old age and death?
What is a condition for old age and death?' Then, through rational
application of mind, I comprehended with wisdom: 'When rebirth exists
there's old age and death. Rebirth is a condition for old age and
death.'

Then it occurred to me: 'When what exists is there rebirth? ...
continued existence ... grasping ... craving ... feeling ... contact ...
the six sense fields ... name and form ... consciousness ... 'When what
exists are there choices? What is a condition for choices?' Then,
through rational application of mind, I comprehended with wisdom: 'When
ignorance exists there are choices. Ignorance is a condition for
choices.'

And so, ignorance is a condition for choices.

Choices are a condition for consciousness. ... That is how this entire
mass of suffering originates. 'Origination, origination.' Such was the
vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me
regarding teachings not learned before from another.

Then it occurred to me: 'When what doesn't exist is there no old age and
death? When what ceases do old age and death cease?' Then, through
rational application of mind, I comprehended with wisdom: 'When rebirth
doesn't exist there's no old age and death. When rebirth ceases, old age
and death cease.'

Then it occurred to me: 'When what doesn't exist is there no rebirth?
... continued existence ... grasping ... craving ... feeling ... contact
... the six sense fields ... name and form ... consciousness ... 'When
what doesn't exist are there no choices? When what ceases do choices
cease?' Then, through rational application of mind, I comprehended with
wisdom: 'When ignorance doesn't exist there are no choices. When
ignorance ceases, choices cease.'

And so, when ignorance ceases, choices cease. When choices cease,
consciousness ceases. ... That is how this entire mass of suffering
ceases. 'Cessation, cessation.' Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom,
realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned
before from another."

## The Chapter on Fuel

### N 12.11 Fuel *Āhārasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. ...

"Mendicants, there are these four fuels. They maintain sentient beings
that have been born and help those that are about to be born. What four?
Solid food, whether solid or subtle; contact is the second, mental
intention the third, and consciousness the fourth. These are the four
fuels that maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those
that are about to be born.

What is the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of these four
fuels? Craving. And what is the source, origin, birthplace, and
inception of craving? Feeling. And what is the source of feeling?
Contact. And what is the source of contact? The six sense fields. And
what is the source of the six sense fields? Name and form. And what is
the source of name and form? Consciousness. And what is the source of
consciousness? Choices. And what is the source of choices? Ignorance.

And so, ignorance is a condition for choices.

Choices are a condition for consciousness. ... That is how this entire
mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with
nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness
ceases. ... That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases."

### N 12.12 Phagguna of the Top-Knot *Moḷiyaphaggunasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, there are these four fuels. They maintain sentient beings
that have been born and help those that are about to be born. What four?
Solid food, whether solid or subtle; contact is the second, mental
intention the third, and consciousness the fourth. These are the four
fuels that maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those
that are about to be born."

When he said this, Venerable Phagguna of the Top-Knot said to the
Buddha, "But sir, who consumes the fuel for consciousness?"

"That's not a fitting question," said the Buddha.

"I don't speak of one who consumes. If I were to speak of one who
consumes, then it would be fitting to ask who consumes. But I don't
speak like that. Hence it would be fitting to ask: 'Consciousness is a
fuel for what?' And a fitting answer to this would be: 'Consciousness is
a fuel that conditions rebirth into a new state of existence in the
future. When that which has been reborn is present, there are the six
sense fields. The six sense fields are a condition for contact.'"

"But sir, who contacts?"

"That's not a fitting question," said the Buddha.

"I don't speak of one who contacts. If I were to speak of one who
contacts, then it would be fitting to ask who contacts. But I don't
speak like that. Hence it would be fitting to ask: 'What is a condition
for contact?' And a fitting answer to this would be: 'The six sense
fields are a condition for contact. Contact is a condition for
feeling.'"

"But sir, who feels?"

"That's not a fitting question," said the Buddha.

"I don't speak of one who feels. If I were to speak of one who feels,
then it would be fitting to ask who feels. But I don't speak like that.
Hence it would be fitting to ask: 'What is a condition for feeling?' And
a fitting answer to this would be: 'Contact is a condition for feeling.
Feeling is a condition for craving.'"

"But sir, who craves?"

"That's not a fitting question," said the Buddha.

"I don't speak of one who craves. If I were to speak of one who craves,
then it would be fitting to ask who craves. But I don't speak like that.
Hence it would be fitting to ask: 'What is a condition for craving?' And
a fitting answer to this would be: 'Feeling is a condition for craving.
Craving is a condition for grasping.'"

"But sir, who grasps?"

"That's not a fitting question," said the Buddha.

"I don't speak of one who grasps. If I were to speak of one who grasps,
then it would be fitting to ask who grasps. But I don't speak like that.
Hence it would be fitting to ask: 'What is a condition for grasping?'
And a fitting answer to this would be: 'Craving is a condition for
grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence.' ... That is
how this entire mass of suffering originates.

When the six fields of contact fade away and cease with nothing left
over, contact ceases. When contact ceases, feeling ceases. When feeling
ceases, craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When
grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence
ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow,
lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease. That is how this entire
mass of suffering ceases."

### N 12.13 Ascetics and Brahmins *Samaṇabrāhmaṇasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, there are ascetics and brahmins who don't understand old
age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that
leads to their cessation. They don't understand rebirth ... continued
existence ... grasping ... craving ... feeling ... contact ... the six
sense fields ... name and form ... consciousness ... They don't
understand choices, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that
leads to their cessation. I don't deem them as true ascetics and
brahmins. Those venerables don't realize the goal of life as an ascetic
or brahmin, and don't live having realized it with their own insight.

There are ascetics and brahmins who do understand old age and death,
their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their
cessation. They understand rebirth ... continued existence ... grasping
... craving ... feeling ... contact ... the six sense fields ... name
and form ... consciousness ... They understand choices, their origin,
their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation. I deem
them as true ascetics and brahmins. Those venerables realize the goal of
life as an ascetic or brahmin, and live having realized it with their
own insight."

### N 12.14 Ascetics and Brahmins (2nd) *Dutiyasamaṇabrāhmaṇasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, there are ascetics and brahmins who don't understand these
things, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to
their cessation. What things don't they understand?

They don't understand old age and death, their origin, their cessation,
and the practice that leads to their cessation. They don't understand
rebirth ... continued existence ... grasping ... craving ... feeling ...
contact ... the six sense fields ... name and form ... consciousness ...
They don't understand choices, their origin, their cessation, and the
practice that leads to their cessation. They don't understand these
things, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to
their cessation. I don't deem them as true ascetics and brahmins. Those
venerables don't realize the goal of life as an ascetic or brahmin, and
don't live having realized it with their own insight.

There are ascetics and brahmins who do understand these things, their
origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation.
What things do they understand?

They understand old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and
the practice that leads to their cessation. They understand rebirth ...
continued existence ... grasping ... craving ... feeling ... contact ...
the six sense fields ... name and form ... consciousness ... They
understand choices, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that
leads to their cessation. They understand these things, their origin,
their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation. I deem
them as true ascetics and brahmins. Those venerables realize the goal of
life as an ascetic or brahmin, and live having realized it with their
own insight."

### N 12.15 Kaccānagotta *Kaccānagottasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then Venerable Kaccānagotta went up to the Buddha, bowed,
sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, they speak of this thing called 'right view'. How is right view
defined?"

"Kaccāna, this world mostly relies on the dual notions of
existence and non-existence.

But when you truly see the origin of the world with right understanding,
the concept of non-existence regarding the world does not occur. And
when you truly see the cessation of the world with right understanding,
the concept of existence regarding the world does not occur.

The world is for the most part shackled by attraction, grasping, and
insisting.

But if---when it comes to this attraction, grasping, mental fixation,
insistence, and underlying tendency---you don't get attracted, grasp,
and commit to the thought, 'my self', you'll have no doubt or
uncertainty that what arises is just suffering arising, and what ceases
is just suffering ceasing. Your knowledge about this is independent of
others.

This is how right view is defined.

'All exists': this is one extreme.

'All does not exist': this is the second extreme.

Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way:

'Ignorance is a condition for choices. Choices are a condition for
consciousness. ... That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.

When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices
cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. ... That is how this
entire mass of suffering ceases.'"

### N 12.16 A Dhamma Speaker *Dhammakathikasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and
said to him:

"Sir, they speak of a 'Dhamma speaker'. How is a Dhamma speaker
defined?"

"If a mendicant teaches Dhamma for disillusionment, dispassion, and
cessation regarding old age and death, they're qualified to be called a
'mendicant who speaks on Dhamma'. If they practice for disillusionment,
dispassion, and cessation regarding old age and death, they're qualified
to be called a 'mendicant who practices in line with the teaching'. If
they're freed by not grasping, by disillusionment, dispassion, and
cessation regarding old age and death, they're qualified to be called a
'mendicant who has attained extinguishment in this very life'.

If a mendicant teaches Dhamma for disillusionment regarding rebirth ...
continued existence ... grasping ... craving ... feeling ... contact ...
the six sense fields ... name and form ... consciousness ... choices ...
If a mendicant teaches Dhamma for disillusionment, dispassion, and
cessation regarding ignorance, they're qualified to be called a
'mendicant who speaks on Dhamma'. If they practice for disillusionment,
dispassion, and cessation regarding ignorance, they're qualified to be
called a 'mendicant who practices in line with the teaching'. If they're
freed by not grasping, by disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation
regarding ignorance, they're qualified to be called a 'mendicant who has
attained extinguishment in this very life'."

### N 12.17 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic *Acelakassapasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding
ground.

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
entered Rājagaha for alms. The naked ascetic Kassapa saw
the Buddha coming off in the distance. He went up to the Buddha, and
exchanged greetings with him.

When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one
side and said to the Buddha,

"I'd like to ask the worthy Gotama about a certain point, if you'd take
the time to answer."

"Kassapa, it's the wrong time for questions. We've entered an inhabited
area."

A second time, and a third time, Kassapa spoke to the Buddha and the
Buddha replied. When this was said, Kassapa said to the Buddha,

"I don't want to ask much."

"Ask what you wish, Kassapa."

"Well, worthy Gotama, is suffering made by oneself?"

"Not so, Kassapa," said the Buddha.

"Then is suffering made by another?"

"Not so, Kassapa," said the Buddha.

"Well, is suffering made by both oneself and another?"

"Not so, Kassapa," said the Buddha.

"Then does suffering arise by chance, not made by oneself or another?"

"Not so, Kassapa," said the Buddha.

"Well, is there no such thing as suffering?"

"It's not that there's no such thing as suffering. Suffering is real."

"Then does the worthy Gotama not know or see suffering?"

"It's not that I don't know or see suffering. I do know suffering, I do
see suffering."

"Worthy Gotama, when asked these questions, you say 'not so'. Yet you
say that there is such a thing as suffering. And you say that you do
know suffering, and you do see suffering. Sir, explain suffering to me!
Teach me about suffering!"

"Suppose that the person who does the deed experiences the result. Then
for one who has existed since the beginning, suffering is made by
oneself. This statement leans toward eternalism. Suppose that one person
does the deed and another experiences the result. Then for one stricken
by feeling, suffering is made by another. This statement leans toward
annihilationism. Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches
by the middle way: 'Ignorance is a condition for choices.

Choices are a condition for consciousness. ... That is how this entire
mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with
nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness
ceases. ... That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.'"

When this was said, Kassapa said to the Buddha, "Excellent, sir!
Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the
hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the
dark so people with clear eyes can see what's there, the Buddha has made
the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the
teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. Sir, may I receive
the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha's presence?"

"Kassapa, if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take
the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training, they must
spend four months on probation. When four months have passed, if the
mendicants are satisfied, they'll give the going forth, the ordination
into monkhood. However, I have recognized individual differences."

"Sir, if four months probation are required in such a case, I'll spend
four years on probation. When four years have passed, if the mendicants
are satisfied, let them give me the going forth, the ordination into
monkhood."

And the naked ascetic Kassapa received the going forth, the ordination
in the Buddha's presence. Not long after his ordination, Venerable
Kassapa, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon
realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very
life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which
gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.

He understood: "Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been
completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further
for this place." And Venerable Kassapa became one of the perfected.

### N 12.18 With Timbaruka *Timbarukasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then the wanderer Timbaruka went up to the Buddha, and exchanged
greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were
over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:

"Well, worthy Gotama, are pleasure and pain made by oneself?"

"Not so, Timbaruka," said the Buddha.

"Then are pleasure and pain made by another?"

"Not so, Timbaruka," said the Buddha.

"Well, are pleasure and pain made by both oneself and another?"

"Not so, Timbaruka," said the Buddha.

"Then do pleasure and pain arise by chance, not made by oneself or
another?"

"Not so, Timbaruka," said the Buddha.

"Well, is there no such thing as pleasure and pain?"

"It's not that there's no such thing as pleasure and pain. Pleasure and
pain are real."

"Then does the worthy Gotama not know or see suffering?"

"It's not that I don't know or see pleasure and pain. I do know pleasure
and pain, I do see pleasure and pain."

"Worthy Gotama, when asked these questions, you say 'not so'. Yet you
say that there is such a thing as pleasure and pain. And you say that
you do know pleasure and pain, and you do see pleasure and pain. Sir,
explain pleasure and pain to me! Teach me about pleasure and pain!"

"Suppose that the feeling and the one who feels it are the same thing.
Then for one who has existed since the beginning, pleasure and pain is
made by oneself. I don't say this. Suppose that the feeling is one thing
and the one who feels it is another. Then for one stricken by feeling,
pleasure and pain is made by another. I don't say this. Avoiding these
two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way: 'Ignorance is
a condition for choices.

Choices are a condition for consciousness. ... That is how this entire
mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with
nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness
ceases. ... That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.'"

When he said this, the wanderer Timbaruka said to the Buddha,
"Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent! ... I go for refuge to the worthy
Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From
this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who
has gone for refuge for life."

### N 12.19 The Astute and the Foolish *Bālapaṇḍitasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, for a fool shrouded by ignorance and fettered by craving,
this body has been produced. So there is the duality of this body and
external name and form. Contact depends on this duality. When contacted
through one or other of the six sense fields, the fool experiences
pleasure and pain.

For an astute person shrouded by ignorance and fettered by craving, this
body has been produced. So there is the duality of this body and
external name and form. Contact depends on this duality. When contacted
through one or other of the six sense fields, the astute person
experiences pleasure and pain.

What, then, is the difference between the foolish and the astute?"

"Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge.
Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The
mendicants will listen and remember it."

"Well then, mendicants, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"For a fool shrouded by ignorance and fettered by craving, this body has
been produced. But the fool has not given up that ignorance or finished
that craving. Why is that? The fool has not completed the spiritual
journey for the complete ending of suffering. Therefore, when their body
breaks up, the fool is reborn in another body. When reborn in another
body, they're not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow,
lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They're not freed from
suffering, I say.

For an astute person shrouded by ignorance and fettered by craving, this
body has been produced. But the astute person has given up that
ignorance and finished that craving. Why is that? The astute person has
completed the spiritual journey for the complete ending of suffering.
Therefore, when their body breaks up, the astute person is not reborn in
another body. Not being reborn in another body, they're freed from
rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness,
and distress. They're freed from suffering, I say. This is the
difference here between the foolish and the astute, that is, leading the
spiritual life."

### N 12.20 Conditions *Paccayasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, I will teach you dependent origination and dependently
originated phenomena. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"And what is dependent origination? Rebirth is a condition for old age
and death. Whether Realized Ones arise or not, this law of nature
persists, this regularity of natural principles, this invariance of
natural principles, specific conditionality. A Realized One understands
this and comprehends it, then he explains, teaches, asserts,
establishes, clarifies, analyzes, and reveals it. 'Look,' he says,
'Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.'

Continued existence is a condition for rebirth ... Grasping is a
condition for continued existence ... Craving is a condition for
grasping ...

Feeling is a condition for craving ... Contact is a condition for
feeling ... The six sense fields are a condition for contact ... Name
and form are conditions for the six sense fields ...

Consciousness is a condition for name and form ...

Choices are a condition for consciousness ... Ignorance is a condition
for choices. Whether Realized Ones arise or not, this law of nature
persists, this regularity of natural principles, this invariance of
natural principles, specific conditionality. A Realized One understands
this and comprehends it, then he explains, teaches, asserts,
establishes, clarifies, analyzes, and reveals it. 'Look,' he says,
'Ignorance is a condition for choices.' So the fact that this is real,
not unreal, not otherwise; the specific conditionality of it: this is
called dependent origination.

And what are the dependently originated phenomena? Old age and death are
impermanent, conditioned, dependently originated, liable to end, vanish,
fade away, and cease. Rebirth ... Continued existence ... Grasping ...
Craving ...

Feeling ... Contact ... The six sense fields ... Name and form ...

Consciousness ...

Choices ... Ignorance is impermanent, conditioned, dependently
originated, liable to end, vanish, fade away, and cease. These are
called the dependently originated phenomena.

When a noble disciple has clearly seen with right wisdom this dependent
origination and these dependently originated phenomena as they are, it
is quite impossible for them to turn back to the past, thinking: 'Did I
exist in the past? Did I not exist in the past? What was I in the past?
How was I in the past? After being what, what did I become in the past?'
Or to turn forward to the future, thinking: 'Will I exist in the future?
Will I not exist in the future? What will I be in the future? How will I
be in the future? After being what, what will I become in the future?'
Or to be undecided about the present, thinking: 'Am I? Am I not? What am
I? How am I? This sentient being---where did it come from? And where
will it go?' Why is that? Because that noble disciple has clearly seen
with right wisdom this dependent origination and these dependently
originated phenomena as they are."

## The Chapter on the Ten Powers

### N 12.21 The Ten Powers *Dasabalasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, a Realized One has ten powers and four kinds of
self-assurance. With these he claims the bull's place, roars his lion's
roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel.

Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form.
Such is feeling, such is the origin of feeling, such is the ending of
feeling. Such is perception, such is the origin of perception, such is
the ending of perception. Such are choices, such is the origin of
choices, such is the ending of choices. Such is consciousness, such is
the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.

When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises. When
this doesn't exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that
ceases. That is:

Ignorance is a condition for choices.

Choices are a condition for consciousness. ... That is how this entire
mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with
nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness
ceases. ... That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases."

### N 12.22 The Ten Powers (2nd) *Dutiyadasabalasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, a Realized One has ten powers and four kinds of
self-assurance. With these he claims the bull's place, roars his lion's
roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel.

Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form.
Such is feeling, such is the origin of feeling, such is the ending of
feeling. Such is perception, such is the origin of perception, such is
the ending of perception. Such are choices, such is the origin of
choices, such is the ending of choices. Such is consciousness, such is
the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.

When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises. When
this doesn't exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that
ceases. That is:

Ignorance is a condition for choices.

Choices are a condition for consciousness. ... That is how this entire
mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with
nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness
ceases. ... That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.

So the teaching has been well explained by me, made clear, opened,
illuminated, and stripped of patchwork. Just this much is quite enough
for a gentleman who has gone forth out of faith to rouse up his energy.
'Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and tendons remain! Let the flesh and
blood waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have
achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.'

A lazy person lives in suffering, mixed up with bad, unskillful
qualities, and ruins a great deal of their own good. An energetic person
lives happily, secluded from bad, unskillful qualities, and fulfills a
great deal of their own good.

The best isn't reached by the worst. The best is reached by the best.
This spiritual life is the cream, mendicants, and the Teacher is before
you.

So you should rouse up energy for attaining the unattained, achieving
the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized, thinking: 'In this way our
going forth will not be wasted, but will be fruitful and fertile. And
our use of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the
sick shall be of great fruit and benefit for those who offered them.'
That's how you should train.

Considering what is good for yourself, mendicants, is quite enough for
you to persist with diligence. Considering what is good for others is
quite enough for you to persist with diligence. Considering what is good
for both is quite enough for you to persist with diligence."

### N 12.23 Vital Conditions *Upanisasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, I say that the ending of defilements is for one who knows
and sees, not for one who does not know or see. For one who knows and
sees what? 'Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending
of form. Such is feeling ... Such is perception ... Such are choices ...
Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the
ending of consciousness.' The ending of the defilements is for one who
knows and sees this.

I say that this knowledge of ending has a vital condition, it doesn't
lack a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: 'Freedom.' I say
that freedom has a vital condition, it doesn't lack a vital condition.
And what is it? You should say: 'Dispassion.' I say that dispassion has
a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: 'Disillusionment.' I
say that disillusionment has a vital condition. And what is it? You
should say: 'Truly knowing and seeing.' I say that truly knowing and
seeing has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say:
'Immersion.' I say that immersion has a vital condition.

And what is it? You should say: 'Bliss.' I say that bliss has a vital
condition. And what is it? You should say: 'Tranquility.' I say that
tranquility has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say:
'Rapture.' I say that rapture has a vital condition. And what is it? You
should say: 'Joy.' I say that joy has a vital condition. And what is it?
You should say: 'Faith.' I say that faith has a vital condition.

And what is it? You should say: 'Suffering.' I say that suffering has a
vital condition. And what is it? You should say: 'Rebirth.' I say that
rebirth has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say:
'Continued existence.' I say that continued existence has a vital
condition. And what is it? You should say: 'Grasping.' I say that
grasping has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say:
'Craving.' I say that craving has a vital condition.

And what is it? You should say: 'Feeling.' ... You should say:
'Contact.' ... You should say: 'The six sense fields.' ... You should
say: 'Name and form.' ... You should say: 'Consciousness.' ... You
should say: 'Choices.' ... I say that choices have a vital condition,
they don't lack a vital condition. And what is the vital condition for
choices? You should say: 'Ignorance.'

So ignorance is a vital condition for choices. Choices are a vital
condition for consciousness. Consciousness is a vital condition for name
and form. Name and form are vital conditions for the six sense fields.
The six sense fields are vital conditions for contact. Contact is a
vital condition for feeling. Feeling is a vital condition for craving.
Craving is a vital condition for grasping. Grasping is a vital condition
for continued existence. Continued existence is a vital condition for
rebirth. Rebirth is a vital condition for suffering. Suffering is a
vital condition for faith. Faith is a vital condition for joy. Joy is a
vital condition for rapture. Rapture is a vital condition for
tranquility. Tranquility is a vital condition for bliss. Bliss is a
vital condition for immersion. Immersion is a vital condition for truly
knowing and seeing. Truly knowing and seeing is a vital condition for
disillusionment. Disillusionment is a vital condition for dispassion.
Dispassion is a vital condition for freedom. Freedom is a vital
condition for the knowledge of ending.

It's like when the heavens rain heavily on a mountain top, and the water
flows downhill to fill the hollows, crevices, and creeks. As they become
full, they fill up the pools. The pools fill up the lakes, the lakes
fill up the streams, and the streams fill up the rivers. And as the
rivers become full, they fill up the ocean.

In the same way, ignorance is a vital condition for choices. ... Freedom
is a vital condition for the knowledge of ending."

### N 12.24 Followers of Other Religions *Aññatitthiyasutta*

Near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove. Then Venerable
Sāriputta robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and
robe, entered Rājagaha for alms. Then it occurred to him,
"It's too early to wander for alms in Rājagaha. Why don't I
visit the monastery of the wanderers of other religions?"

Then he went to the monastery of the wanderers of other religions and
exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. When the greetings and
polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The wanderers
said to him:

"Reverend Sāriputta, there are ascetics and brahmins who
teach the efficacy of deeds. Some of them declare that suffering is made
by oneself. Some of them declare that suffering is made by another. Some
of them declare that suffering is made by both oneself and another. Some
of them declare that suffering arises by chance, not made by oneself or
another. What does the ascetic Gotama say about this? How does he
explain it? How should we answer so as to repeat what the ascetic Gotama
has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? How should we
explain in line with his teaching, with no legitimate grounds for
rebuttal and criticism?"

"Reverends, the Buddha said that suffering is dependently originated.
Dependent on what? Dependent on contact. If you said this you would
repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an
untruth. You would explain in line with his teaching, and there would be
no legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism.

Consider the ascetics and brahmins who teach the efficacy of deeds. In
the case of those who declare that suffering is made by oneself, that's
conditioned by contact. In the case of those who declare that suffering
is made by another, that's also conditioned by contact. In the case of
those who declare that suffering is made by oneself and another, that's
also conditioned by contact. In the case of those who declare that
suffering arises by chance, not made by oneself or another, that's also
conditioned by contact.

Consider the ascetics and brahmins who teach the efficacy of deeds. In
the case of those who declare that suffering is made by oneself, it's
impossible that they will experience that without contact. In the case
of those who declare that suffering is made by another, it's impossible
that they will experience that without contact. In the case of those who
declare that suffering is made by oneself and another, it's impossible
that they will experience that without contact. In the case of those who
declare that suffering arises by chance, not made by oneself or another,
it's impossible that they will experience that without contact."

Venerable Ānanda heard this discussion between Venerable
Sāriputta and those wanderers of other religions. Then
Ānanda wandered for alms in Rājagaha. After the meal, on
his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed.

"Good, good, Ānanda! It's just as Sāriputta has so rightly
explained. I have said that suffering is dependently originated.
Dependent on what? Dependent on contact. Saying this you would repeat
what I have said, and not misrepresent me with an untruth. You would
explain in line with my teaching, and there would be no legitimate
grounds for rebuttal and criticism.

Consider the ascetics and brahmins who teach the efficacy of deeds. In
the case of those who declare that suffering is made by oneself, that's
conditioned by contact. ... In the case of those who declare that
suffering arises by chance, not made by oneself or another, that's also
conditioned by contact.

In the case of those who declare that suffering is made by oneself, it's
impossible that they will experience that without contact. ... In the
case of those who declare that suffering arises by chance, not made by
oneself or another, it's impossible that they will experience that
without contact.

Ānanda, this one time I was staying near Rājagaha, in the
Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding ground. Then I robed up in the
morning and, taking my bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for
alms. Then I thought: 'It's too early to wander for alms in
Rājagaha. Why don't I visit the monastery of the wanderers
of other religions?'

Then I went to the monastery of the wanderers of other religions and
exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. When the greetings and
polite conversation were over, I sat down to one side. ..."

(The wanderers asked the Buddha the very same questions, and he gave the
same answers.)

"It's incredible, sir, it's amazing, how the whole matter is stated with
one phrase. Could there be a detailed explanation of this matter that is
both deep and appears deep?"

"Well then, Ānanda, clarify this matter yourself."

"Sir, suppose they were to ask me: 'Reverend Ānanda, what is the source,
origin, birthplace, and inception of old age and death?' I'd answer like
this: 'Reverends, rebirth is the source, origin, birthplace, and
inception of old age and death.' That's how I'd answer such a question.

Suppose they were to ask me: 'What is the source of rebirth?' I'd answer
like this: 'Continued existence is the source of rebirth.' That's how
I'd answer such a question.

Suppose they were to ask me: 'What is the source of continued
existence?' I'd answer like this: 'Grasping is the source of continued
existence.' That's how I'd answer such a question.

Suppose they were to ask me: 'What is the source of grasping?' ...
craving ... feeling ... Suppose they were to ask me: 'What is the source
of contact?' I'd answer like this: 'The six sense fields are the source,
origin, birthplace, and inception of contact.' 'When the six fields of
contact fade away and cease with nothing left over, contact ceases. When
contact ceases, feeling ceases. When feeling ceases, craving ceases.
When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued
existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When
rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness,
and distress cease. That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.'
That's how I'd answer such a question."

### N 12.25 With Bhūmija *Bhūmijasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Bhūmija came out of
retreat, went to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged
greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were
over, he sat down to one side and said to him:

"Reverend Sāriputta, there are ascetics and brahmins who
teach the efficacy of deeds. Some of them declare that pleasure and pain
are made by oneself. Some of them declare that pleasure and pain are
made by another. Some of them declare that pleasure and pain are made by
both oneself and another. Some of them declare that pleasure and pain
arise by chance, not made by oneself or another. What does the Buddha
say about this? How does he explain it? How should we answer so as to
repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an
untruth? How should we explain in line with his teaching, with no
legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism?"

"Reverend, the Buddha said that pleasure and pain are dependently
originated. Dependent on what? Dependent on contact. If you said this
you would repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with
an untruth. You would explain in line with his teaching, and there would
be no legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism.

Consider the ascetics and brahmins who teach the efficacy of deeds. In
the case of those who declare that pleasure and pain are made by
oneself, that's conditioned by contact. ... In the case of those who
declare that pleasure and pain arise by chance, not made by oneself or
another, that's also conditioned by contact.

Consider the ascetics and brahmins who teach the efficacy of deeds. In
the case of those who declare that pleasure and pain are made by
oneself, it's impossible that they will experience that without contact.
... In the case of those who declare that pleasure and pain arise by
chance, not made by oneself or another, it's impossible that they will
experience that without contact."

Venerable Ānanda heard this discussion between Venerable
Sāriputta and Venerable Bhūmija. Then
Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and
informed the Buddha of all they had discussed.

"Good, good, Ānanda! It's just as Sāriputta has so rightly
explained. I have said that pleasure and pain are dependently
originated. Dependent on what? Dependent on contact. Saying this you
would repeat what I have said, and not misrepresent me with an untruth.
You would explain in line with my teaching, and there would be no
legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism.

Consider the ascetics and brahmins who teach the efficacy of deeds. In
the case of those who declare that pleasure and pain are made by
oneself, that's conditioned by contact. ... In the case of those who
declare that pleasure and pain arise by chance, not made by oneself or
another, that's also conditioned by contact.

Consider the ascetics and brahmins who teach the efficacy of deeds. In
the case of those who declare that pleasure and pain are made by
oneself, it's impossible that they will experience that without contact.
... In the case of those who declare that pleasure and pain arise by
chance, not made by oneself or another, it's impossible that they will
experience that without contact.

Ānanda, as long as there's a body, the intention that gives rise to
bodily action causes pleasure and pain to arise in oneself. As long as
there's a voice, the intention that gives rise to verbal action causes
pleasure and pain to arise in oneself. As long as there's a mind, the
intention that gives rise to mental action causes pleasure and pain to
arise in oneself. But these only apply when conditioned by ignorance.

By oneself one instigates the choice that gives rise to bodily, verbal,
and mental action, conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in
oneself. Or else others instigate the choice ... One consciously
instigates the choice ... Or else one unconsciously instigates the
choice ...

Ignorance is included in all these things. But when ignorance fades away
and ceases with nothing left over, there is no body and no voice and no
mind, conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in oneself.
There is no field, no ground, no scope, no basis, conditioned by which
that pleasure and pain arise in oneself."

### N 12.26 With Upavāna *Upavāṇasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then Venerable Upavāna went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat
down to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, there are some ascetics and brahmins who declare that suffering is
made by oneself. There are some who declare that suffering is made by
another. There are some who declare that suffering is made by both
oneself and another. There are some who declare that suffering arises by
chance, not made by oneself or another.

What does the Buddha say about this? How does he explain it? How should
we answer so as to repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent
him with an untruth? How should we explain in line with his teaching,
with no legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism?"

"Upavāna, I have said that suffering is dependently
originated. Dependent on what? Dependent on contact. Saying this you
would repeat what I have said, and not misrepresent me with an untruth.
You would explain in line with my teaching, and there would be no
legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism.

In the case of those ascetics and brahmins who declare that suffering is
made by oneself, that's conditioned by contact. ... In the case of those
who declare that suffering arises by chance, not made by oneself or
another, that's also conditioned by contact.

In the case of those ascetics and brahmins who declare that suffering is
made by oneself, it's impossible that they will experience that without
contact. ... In the case of those who declare that suffering arises by
chance, not made by oneself or another, it's impossible that they will
experience that without contact."

### N 12.27 Conditions *Paccayasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Ignorance is a condition for choices.

Choices are a condition for consciousness. ... That is how this entire
mass of suffering originates.

And what is old age and death? The old age, decrepitude, broken teeth,
grey hair, wrinkly skin, diminished vitality, and failing faculties of
the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings.
This is called old age. The passing away, passing on, disintegration,
demise, mortality, death, decease, breaking up of the aggregates, and
laying to rest of the corpse of the various sentient beings in the
various orders of sentient beings. This is called death. Such is old
age, and such is death. This is called old age and death. Rebirth is the
origin of old age and death. When rebirth ceases, old age and death
cease. The practice that leads to the cessation of old age and death is
simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought,
right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right
mindfulness, and right immersion.

And what is rebirth? ... And what is continued existence? ... And what
is grasping? ... And what is craving? ... And what is feeling? ... And
what is contact? ... And what are the six sense fields? ... And what are
name and form? ... And what is consciousness? ...

And what are choices? There are three kinds of choices. Choices by way
of body, speech, and mind. These are called choices. Ignorance is the
origin of choices. When ignorance ceases, choices cease. The practice
that leads to the cessation of choices is simply this noble eightfold
path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action,
right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.

A noble disciple understands conditions, their origin, their cessation,
and the practice that leads to their cessation. Such a noble disciple is
one who is called 'one accomplished in view', 'one accomplished in
vision', 'one who has come to the true teaching', 'one who sees this
true teaching', 'one endowed with a trainee's knowledge', 'one who has
entered the stream of the teaching', 'a noble one with penetrative
wisdom', and also 'one who stands pushing open the door to freedom from
death'."

### N 12.28 A Mendicant *Bhikkhusutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"A mendicant understands old age and death, their origin, their
cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation. They
understand rebirth ... continued existence ... grasping ... craving ...
feeling ... contact ... the six sense fields ... name and form ...
consciousness ... They understand choices, their origin, their
cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation.

And what is old age and death? The old age, decrepitude, broken teeth,
grey hair, wrinkly skin, diminished vitality, and failing faculties of
the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings.
This is called old age. The passing away, passing on, disintegration,
demise, mortality, death, decease, breaking up of the aggregates, and

various orders of sentient beings. This is called death. Such is old
age, and such is death. This is called old age and death. Rebirth is the
origin of old age and death. When rebirth ceases, old age and death
cease. The practice that leads to the cessation of old age and death is
simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought,
right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right
mindfulness, and right immersion.

And what is rebirth? ... And what is continued existence? ... And what
is grasping? ... And what is craving? ... feeling ... contact ... the
six sense fields ... name and form ... consciousness ...

And what are choices? There are three kinds of choices. Choices by way
of body, speech, and mind. These are called choices. Ignorance is the
origin of choices. When ignorance ceases, choices cease. The practice
that leads to the cessation of choices is simply this noble eightfold
path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action,

A mendicant understands old age and death, their origin, their
cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation. They
understand rebirth ... continued existence ... grasping ... craving ...
feeling ... contact ... the six sense fields ... name and form ...

who sees this true teaching', 'one endowed with a trainee's knowledge',
'one who has entered the stream of the teaching', 'a noble one with
penetrative wisdom', and also 'one who stands pushing open the door to
freedom from death'."

### N 12.29 Ascetics and Brahmins *Samaṇabrāhmaṇasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, there are ascetics and brahmins who don't understand old

transcended old age and death. They don't understand rebirth ...

## The Chapter with Kaḷāra the Aristocrat

### N 12.31 What Has Come to Be *Bhūtasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī.

Then the Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta,
"Sāriputta, this was said in 'The Way to the Far Shore', in
'The Questions of Ajita':

> 'There are those who have appraised the teaching,\
> and many kinds of trainees here.\
> Tell me about their behavior, good fellow,\
> when asked, for you are alert.'

How should we see the detailed meaning of this brief statement?"

When he said this, Sāriputta kept silent.

For a second time ...

For a third time ...

Sāriputta kept silent.

"Sāriputta, do you see that this has come to be?"

"Sir, one truly sees with right wisdom that this has come to be. Seeing
this, one is practicing for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation
regarding what has come to be. One truly sees with right wisdom that it
originated with that as fuel. Seeing this, one is practicing for
disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding the fuel for its
origination. One truly sees with right wisdom that when that fuel
ceases, what has come to be is liable to cease. Seeing this, one is
practicing for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding what
is liable to cease. In this way one is a trainee.

And what, sir, is one who has appraised the teaching? Sir, one truly
sees with right wisdom that this has come to be. Seeing this, one is
freed by not grasping through disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation
regarding what has come to be. One truly sees with right wisdom that it
originated with that as fuel. Seeing this, one is freed by not grasping
through disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding the fuel
for its origination. One truly sees with right wisdom that when that
fuel ceases, what has come to be is liable to cease. Seeing this, one is
freed by not grasping through disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation
regarding what is liable to cease. In this way one has appraised the
teaching.

Sir, regarding what was said in 'The Way to the Far Shore', in 'The
Questions of Ajita':

> 'There are those who have appraised the teaching,\
> and many kinds of trainees here.\
> Tell me about their behavior, good fellow,\
> when asked, for you are alert.'

This is how I understand the detailed meaning of what was said in
brief."

"Good, good, Sāriputta!" (The Buddha repeated all of
Sāriputta's explanation, concluding:)

This is how to understand the detailed meaning of what was said in
brief."

### N 12.32 With Kaḷāra the Aristocrat *Kaḷārasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then the mendicant Kaḷāra the Aristocrat went up to
Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When
the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side
and said to him, "Reverend Sāriputta, the mendicant
Phagguna of the Top-Knot has resigned the training and returned to a
lesser life."

"That venerable mustn't have got any satisfaction in this teaching and
training."

"Well then, has Venerable Sāriputta found satisfaction in
this teaching and training?"

"Reverend, I have no uncertainty."

"But what of the future?"

"I have no doubt."

Then Kaḷāra the Aristocrat went up to the Buddha, bowed,
sat down to one side, and said to him, "Sir, Venerable
Sāriputta has declared enlightenment: 'I understand:
"Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to
be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place."'"

So the Buddha addressed one of the monks, "Please, monk, in my name tell
Sāriputta that the teacher summons him."

"Yes, sir," that monk replied. He went to Sāriputta and
said to him, "Reverend Sāriputta, the teacher summons you."

"Yes, reverend," replied Sāriputta. He went to the Buddha,
bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,
"Sāriputta, is it really true that you have declared
enlightenment: 'I understand: "Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey
has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing
further for this place"'?"

"Sir, I did not state the matter in these words and phrases."

"Sāriputta, no matter how a gentleman declares
enlightenment, what he has declared should be regarded as such."

"Sir, did I not also say that I did not state the matter in these words
and phrases?"

"Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you: 'But Reverend
Sāriputta, how have you known and seen so that you've
declared enlightenment: "I understand: 'Rebirth is ended, the spiritual
journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is
nothing further for this place.'"' How would you answer?"

"Sir, if they were to ask me this, I would answer: 'Reverends, because
of the ending of the source of rebirth, when it ended, I knew "it is
ended". Knowing this, I understand: "Rebirth is ended, the spiritual
journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is
nothing further for this place."' That's how I'd answer such a
question."

"But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you: 'But what is
the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of rebirth?' How would you
answer?"

"Sir, if they were to ask me this, I would answer: 'Continued existence
is the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of rebirth.' That's how
I'd answer such a question."

"But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you: 'What is the
source of continued existence?' How would you answer?"

"Sir, if they were to ask me this, I'd answer: 'Grasping is the source
of continued existence.' That's how I'd answer such a question."

"But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you: 'What is the
source of grasping?' ... But Sāriputta, suppose they were
to ask you: 'What is the source of craving?' How would you answer?"

"Sir, if they were to ask me this, I'd answer: 'Feeling is the source of
craving.' That's how I'd answer such a question."

"But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you: 'But how have
you known and seen so that the relishing of feelings is no longer
present?' How would you answer?"

"Sir, if they were to ask me this, I'd answer: 'Reverends, there are
three feelings. What three? Pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling.
These three feelings are impermanent, and what's impermanent is
suffering. When I understood this, the relishing of feelings was no
longer present.' That's how I'd answer such a question."

"Good, good, Sāriputta! The same point may also be briefly
explained in this way: 'Suffering includes whatever is felt.'

But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you: 'But Reverend,
how have you been released that you declare enlightenment: "I
understand: 'Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed,
what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this
place.'"?' How would you answer?"

"Sir, if they were to ask me this, I'd answer: 'Because of an inner
release with the ending of all grasping, I live mindfully so that
defilements don't defile me and I don't look down on myself.' That's how
I'd answer such a question."

"Good, good, Sāriputta! The same point may also be briefly
explained in this way: 'I have no uncertainty regarding the defilements
spoken of by the ascetic. I have no doubt that I've given them up.'"

That is what the Buddha said. When he had spoken, the Holy One got up
from his seat and entered his dwelling.

Then soon after the Buddha left, Venerable Sāriputta said
to the mendicants, "Reverends, the first question that the Buddha asked
me was something that I'd not previously considered, so I hesitated. But
when the Buddha agreed with my answer, I thought: 'If the Buddha were to
question me all day on this matter in different words and ways, I could
answer all day with different words and ways. If he were to question me
all night, all day and night, for two days and nights, for three, four,
five, six, or seven days and nights, I could answer in different words
and ways for seven days and nights.'"

Then Kaḷāra the Aristocrat went up to the Buddha, bowed,
sat down to one side, and said to him, "Sir, Venerable
Sāriputta has roared his lion's roar!" (And he told the
Buddha all that Sāriputta had said.)

"Mendicant, Sāriputta has clearly comprehended the
principle of the teachings, so that he could answer any questions I
might ask him in different words and ways up to the seventh day and
night."

### N 12.33 Grounds for Knowledge *Ñāṇavatthusutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, I will teach forty-four grounds for knowledge. Listen and
apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"And what are the forty-four grounds for knowledge? Knowledge of old age
and death, knowledge of the origin of old age and death, knowledge of
the cessation of old age and death, and knowledge of the practice that
leads to the cessation of old age and death. Knowledge of rebirth ...
Knowledge of continued existence ... Knowledge of grasping ... Knowledge
of craving ... Knowledge of feeling ... Knowledge of contact ...
Knowledge of the six sense fields ... Knowledge of name and form ...
Knowledge of consciousness ... Knowledge of choices, knowledge of the
origin of choices, knowledge of the cessation of choices, and knowledge
of the practice that leads to the cessation of choices. These are called
the forty-four grounds for knowledge.

And what is old age and death? The old age, decrepitude, broken teeth,
grey hair, wrinkly skin, diminished vitality, and failing faculties of
the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings.
This is called old age. The passing away, passing on, disintegration,
demise, mortality, death, decease, breaking up of the aggregates, and
laying to rest of the corpse of the various sentient beings in the
various orders of sentient beings. This is called death. Such is old
age, and such is death. This is called old age and death.

Rebirth is the origin of old age and death. When rebirth ceases, old age
and death cease. The practice that leads to the cessation of old age and
death is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right
thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort,
right mindfulness, and right immersion.

A noble disciple understands old age and death, their origin, their
cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation. This is their
knowledge of the present phenomenon. With this present phenomenon that
is seen, known, immediate, attained, and fathomed, they infer to the
past and future.

Whatever ascetics and brahmins in the past directly knew old age and
death, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to
their cessation, all of them directly knew these things in exactly the
same way that I do now.

Whatever ascetics and brahmins in the future will directly know old age
and death, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to
their cessation, all of them will directly know these things in exactly
the same way that I do now. This is their inferential knowledge.

A noble disciple has purified and cleansed these two
knowledges---knowledge of the present phenomena, and inferential
knowledge. When a noble disciple has done this, they're one who is
called 'one accomplished in view', 'one accomplished in vision', 'one
who has come to the true teaching', 'one who sees this true teaching',
'one endowed with a trainee's knowledge', 'one who has entered the
stream of the teaching', 'a noble one with penetrative wisdom', and also
'one who stands pushing open the door to freedom from death'.

And what is rebirth? ... And what is continued existence? ... And what
is grasping? ... And what is craving? ... And what is feeling? ... And
what is contact? ... And what are the six sense fields? ... And what are
name and form? ... And what is consciousness? ... And what are choices?
There are three kinds of choices. Choices by way of body, speech, and
mind. These are called choices.

Ignorance is the origin of choices. When ignorance ceases, choices
cease. The practice that leads to the cessation of choices is simply
this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right
speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,
and right immersion.

A noble disciple understands choices, their origin, their cessation, and
the practice that leads to their cessation. This is their knowledge of
the present phenomenon. With this present phenomenon that is seen,
known, immediate, attained, and fathomed, they infer to the past and
future.

Whatever ascetics and brahmins in the past directly knew choices, their
origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation,
all of them directly knew these things in exactly the same way that I do
now.

Whatever ascetics and brahmins in the future will directly know choices,
their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their
cessation, all of them will directly know these things in exactly the
same way that I do now. This is their inferential knowledge.

A noble disciple has purified and cleansed these two
knowledges---knowledge of the present phenomena, and inferential
knowledge. When a noble disciple has done this, they're one who is
called 'one accomplished in view', 'one accomplished in vision', 'one
who has come to the true teaching', 'one who sees this true teaching',
'one endowed with a trainee's knowledge', 'one who has entered the
stream of the teaching', 'a noble one with penetrative wisdom', and also
'one who stands pushing open the door to freedom from death'."

### N 12.34 Grounds for Knowledge (2nd) *Dutiyañāṇavatthusutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, I will teach seventy-seven grounds for knowledge. Listen
and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"And what are the seventy-seven grounds for knowledge? The knowledge
that rebirth is a condition for old age and death, and the knowledge
that when rebirth doesn't exist, there is no old age and death. Also
regarding the past: the knowledge that rebirth is a condition for old
age and death, and the knowledge that when rebirth doesn't exist, there
is no old age and death. Also regarding the future: the knowledge that
rebirth is a condition for old age and death, and the knowledge that
when rebirth doesn't exist, there is no old age and death. And also
their knowledge that even this knowledge of the stability of natural
principles is liable to end, vanish, fade away, and cease.

The knowledge that continued existence is a condition for rebirth ...
The knowledge that ignorance is a condition for choices, and the
knowledge that when ignorance doesn't exist, there are no choices. Also
regarding the past: the knowledge that ignorance is a condition for
choices, and the knowledge that when ignorance doesn't exist, there are
no choices. Also regarding the future: the knowledge that ignorance is a
condition for choices, and the knowledge that when ignorance doesn't
exist, there are no choices. And also their knowledge that even this
knowledge of the stability of natural principles is liable to end,
vanish, fade away, and cease. These are called the seventy-seven grounds
for knowledge."

### N 12.35 Ignorance is a Condition *Avijjāpaccayasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Ignorance is a condition for choices.

Choices are a condition for consciousness. ... That is how this entire
mass of suffering originates."

When this was said, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha, "What are
old age and death, sir, and who do they belong to?"

"That's not a fitting question," said the Buddha. "You might say, 'What
are old age and death, and who do they belong to?' Or you might say,
'Old age and death are one thing, who they belong to is another.' But
both of these mean the same thing, only the phrasing differs. Mendicant,
if you have the view that the soul and the body are the same thing,
there is no living of the spiritual life. If you have the view that the
soul and the body are different things, there is no living of the
spiritual life. Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by
the middle way: 'Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.'"

"What is rebirth, sir, and who does it belong to?"

"That's not a fitting question," said the Buddha. "You might say, 'What
is rebirth, and who does it belong to?' Or you might say, 'Rebirth is
one thing, who it belongs to is another.' But both of these mean the
same thing, only the phrasing differs. Mendicant, if you have the view
that the soul and the body are the same thing, there is no living of the
spiritual life. If you have the view that the soul and the body are
different things, there is no living of the spiritual life. Avoiding
these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way:
'Continued existence is a condition for rebirth.'"

"What is continued existence, sir, and who is it for?"

"That's not a fitting question," said the Buddha. "You might say, 'What
is continued existence, and who does it belong to?' Or you might say,
'Continued existence is one thing, who it belongs to is another.' But
both of these mean the same thing, only the phrasing differs. Mendicant,
if you have the view that the soul and the body are identical, there is
no living of the spiritual life. If you have the view that the soul and
the body are different things, there is no living of the spiritual life.
Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way:
'Grasping is a condition for continued existence.' ... 'Craving is a
condition for grasping.' ... 'Feeling is a condition for craving.' ...
'Contact is a condition for feeling.' ... 'The six sense fields are
conditions for contact.' ... 'Name and form are conditions for the six
sense fields.' ... 'Consciousness is a condition for name and form.' ...
'Choices are a condition for consciousness.'"

"What are choices, sir, and who do they belong to?"

"That's not a fitting question," said the Buddha. "You might say, 'What
are choices, and who do they belong to?' Or you might say, 'Choices are
one thing, who they belong to is another.' But both of these mean the
same thing, only the phrasing differs. Mendicant, if you have the view
that the soul and the body are the same thing, there is no living of the
spiritual life. If you have the view that the soul and the body are
different things, there is no living of the spiritual life. Avoiding
these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way:
'Ignorance is a condition for choices.'

When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, then any
twists, ducks, and dodges are given up: 'What are old age and death, and
who do they belong to?' or 'old age and death are one thing, who they
belong to is another', or 'the soul and the body are the same thing', or
'the soul and the body are different things.' These are all cut off at
the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in
the future.

### N 12.37 Not Yours *Natumhasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, this body doesn't belong to you or to anyone else. It's old
deeds, and should be seen as produced by choices and intentions, as
something to be felt.

A learned noble disciple carefully and rationally applies the mind to
dependent origination itself: 'When this exists, that is; due to the
arising of this, that arises. When this doesn't exist, that is not; due
to the cessation of this, that ceases. That is: Ignorance is a condition
for choices.

Choices are a condition for consciousness. ... That is how this entire
mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with
nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness
ceases. ... That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.'"

### N 12.38 Intention *Cetanāsutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, what you intend or plan, and what you have underlying
tendencies for become a support for the continuation of consciousness.
When this support exists, consciousness becomes established. When
consciousness is established and grows, there is rebirth into a new
state of existence in the future. When there is rebirth into a new state
of existence in the future, future rebirth, old age, and death come to
be, as do sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. That is how
this entire mass of suffering originates.

## The Chapter on Householders

### N 12.41 Dangers and Threats *Pañcaverabhayasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha,
bowed, and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the Buddha said to
the householder Anāthapiṇḍika:

"Householder, when a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and
threats, has the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and
comprehended the noble system with wisdom, they may, if they wish,
declare of themselves: 'I've finished with rebirth in hell, the animal
realm, and the ghost realm. I've finished with all places of loss, bad
places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I'm not liable to be
reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.'

What are the five dangers and threats they have quelled? Anyone who
kills living creatures creates dangers and threats both in this life and
in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. That danger
and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from killing living
creatures.

Anyone who steals creates dangers and threats both in this life and in
lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. That danger and
threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from stealing.

Anyone who commits sexual misconduct creates dangers and threats both in
this life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness.
That danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from
committing sexual misconduct.

Anyone who lies creates dangers and threats both in this life and in
lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. That danger and
threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from lying.

Anyone who consumes beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants creates dangers
and threats both in this life and in lives to come, and experiences
mental pain and sadness. That danger and threat is quelled for anyone
who refrains from consuming beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants. These
are the five dangers and threats they have quelled.

What are the four factors of stream-entry that they have? It's when a
noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha: 'That Blessed
One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and
conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to
train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.'

They have experiential confidence in the teaching: 'The teaching is well
explained by the Buddha---apparent in the present life, immediately
effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can
know it for themselves.'

They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: 'The
Saṅgha of the Buddha's disciples is practicing the way
that's good, sincere, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four
pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the
Buddha's disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods,
worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of
greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the
world.'

And a noble disciple's ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones,
unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by
sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. These are the
four factors of stream-entry that they have.

And what is the noble system that they have clearly seen and
comprehended with wisdom? A noble disciple carefully and rationally
applies the mind to dependent origination itself: 'When this exists,
that is; when this doesn't exist, that is not. Due to the arising of
this, that arises; due to the cessation of this, that ceases. Ignorance
is a condition for choices.

Choices are a condition for consciousness. ... That is how this entire
mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with
nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness
ceases. ... That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.' This is
the noble system that they have clearly seen and comprehended with
wisdom.

When a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, has the four
factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble
system with wisdom, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves: 'I've
finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm.
I've finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am
a stream-enterer! I'm not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am
bound for awakening.'"

### N 12.42 Dangers and Threats (2nd) *Dutiyapañcaverabhayasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, when a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats,
has the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and
comprehended the noble system with wisdom, they may, if they wish,
declare of themselves: 'I've finished with rebirth in hell, the animal
realm, and the ghost realm. I've finished with all places of loss, bad
places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I'm not liable to be
reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.'

What are the five dangers and threats they have quelled? Killing living
creatures ... stealing ... sexual misconduct ... lying ... consuming
beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants ... These are the five dangers and
threats they have quelled.

What are the four factors of stream-entry that they have? It's when a
noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha ... the
teaching ... the Saṅgha ... and their ethical conduct is
loved by the noble ones. These are the four factors of stream-entry that
they have.

And what is the noble system that they have clearly seen and
comprehended with wisdom? A noble disciple carefully and rationally

### N 12.43 Suffering *Dukkhasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, I will teach you the origin and ending of suffering. Listen
and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"And what, mendicants, is the origin of suffering? Eye consciousness
arises dependent on the eye and sights. The meeting of the three is
contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for
craving. This is the origin of suffering.

Ear consciousness arises dependent on the ear and sounds. ... Nose
consciousness arises dependent on the nose and smells. ... Tongue
consciousness arises dependent on the tongue and tastes. ... Body
consciousness arises dependent on the body and touches. ... Mind
consciousness arises dependent on the mind and ideas. The meeting of the
three is contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a
condition for craving. This is the origin of suffering.

And what is the ending of suffering? Eye consciousness arises dependent
on the eye and sights. The meeting of the three is contact. Contact is a
condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. When that
craving fades away and ceases with nothing left over, grasping ceases.
When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued
existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and
death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease. That is
how this entire mass of suffering ceases. This is the ending of
suffering.

Ear consciousness arises dependent on the ear and sounds. ... Nose
consciousness arises dependent on the nose and smells. ... Tongue
consciousness arises dependent on the tongue and tastes. ... Body
consciousness arises dependent on the body and touches. ... Mind
consciousness arises dependent on the mind and ideas. The meeting of the
three is contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a
condition for craving. When that craving fades away and ceases with
nothing left over, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued
existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When
rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness,
and distress cease. That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.
This is the ending of suffering."

### N 12.44 The World *Lokasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, I will teach you the origin and ending of the world. Listen
and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"And what, mendicants, is the origin of the world? Eye consciousness
arises dependent on the eye and sights. The meeting of the three is
contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for
craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition
for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth.
Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain,
sadness, and distress to come to be. This is the origin of the world.

Ear consciousness arises dependent on the ear and sounds. ... Nose
consciousness arises dependent on the nose and smells. ... Tongue
consciousness arises dependent on the tongue and tastes. ... Body
consciousness arises dependent on the body and touches. ... Mind
consciousness arises dependent on the mind and ideas. The meeting of the
three is contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. ... Rebirth is a
condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and
distress to come to be. This is the origin of the world.

And what is the ending of the world? Eye consciousness arises dependent
on the eye and sights. The meeting of the three is contact. Contact is a
condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. When that
craving fades away and ceases with nothing left over, grasping ceases.
When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. ... That is how this
entire mass of suffering ceases. This is the ending of the world.

Ear consciousness arises dependent on the ear and sounds. ... Nose

condition for craving. When that craving fades away and ceases with
nothing left over, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued
existence ceases. ... That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.
This is the ending of the world."

### N 12.45 At Ñātika *Ñātikasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at
Ñātika in the brick house. Then while the Buddha was in
private retreat he spoke this exposition of the teaching:

"Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights. The meeting
of the three is contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is
a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. ... That
is how this entire mass of suffering originates.

Ear consciousness arises dependent on the ear and sounds. ... Nose
consciousness arises dependent on the nose and smells. ... Tongue
consciousness arises dependent on the tongue and tastes. ... Body
consciousness arises dependent on the body and touches. ... Mind
consciousness arises dependent on the mind and ideas. The meeting of the
three is contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a
condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. ... That is
how this entire mass of suffering originates.

Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights. The meeting of
the three is contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a
condition for craving. When that craving fades away and ceases with
nothing left over, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued
existence ceases. ... That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.

Ear consciousness arises dependent on the ear and sounds. ... Mind
consciousness arises dependent on the mind and ideas. The meeting of the
three is contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a
condition for craving. When that craving fades away and ceases with
nothing left over, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued
existence ceases. ... That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases."

Now at that time a certain monk was standing listening in on the Buddha.
The Buddha saw him and said, "Monk, did you hear that exposition of the
teaching?"

"Yes, sir."

"Learn that exposition of the teaching, memorize it, and remember it.
That exposition of the teaching is beneficial and relates to the
fundamentals of the spiritual life."

### N 12.46 A Certain Brahmin *Aññatarabrāhmaṇasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings
with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat
down to one side and said to the Buddha:

"Worthy Gotama, does the person who does the deed experience the
result?"

"'The person who does the deed experiences the result': this is one
extreme, brahmin."

"Then does one person do the deed and another experience the result?"

"'One person does the deed and another experiences the result': this is
the second extreme.

Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way:
'Ignorance is a condition for choices.

Choices are a condition for consciousness. ... That is how this entire
mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with
nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease ... That is how
this entire mass of suffering ceases.'"

When he said this, the brahmin said to the Buddha, "Excellent, worthy
Gotama! Excellent! ... From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama
remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."

### N 12.47 Jānussoṇi *Jāṇussoṇisutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then the brahmin Jānussoṇi went up to the Buddha, and
exchanged greetings with him. Seated to one side he said to the Buddha:

"Worthy Gotama, does all exist?"

"'All exists': this is one extreme, brahmin."

"Then does all not exist?"

"'All does not exist': this is the second extreme.

Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way:
'Ignorance is a condition for choices.

Choices are a condition for consciousness. ... That is how this entire
mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with
nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness
ceases. ... That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.'"

When he said this, the brahmin Jānussoṇi said to the
Buddha, "Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent! ... From this day forth,
may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for
refuge for life."

### N 12.48 A Cosmologist *Lokāyatikasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then a brahmin cosmologist went up to the Buddha ... Seated to one side
he said to the Buddha:

"Worthy Gotama, does all exist?"

"'All exists': this is the oldest cosmology, brahmin."

"Then does all not exist?"

"'All does not exist': this is the second cosmology.

"Well, is all a unity?"

"'All is a unity': this is the third cosmology.

"Then is all a plurality?"

"'All is a plurality': this is the fourth cosmology.

Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way:
'Ignorance is a condition for choices.

Choices are a condition for consciousness. ... That is how this entire
mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with
nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness
ceases. ... That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.'"

When he said this, the brahmin cosmologist said to the Buddha,
"Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent! ... From this day forth, may the
worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for
life."

### N 12.49 A Noble Disciple *Ariyasāvakasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, a learned noble disciple doesn't think: 'When what exists,
what is? Due to the arising of what, what arises? When what exists do
name and form come to be? When what exists do the six sense fields ...
contact ... feeling ... craving ... grasping ... continued existence ...
rebirth ... old age and death come to be?'

Rather, a learned noble disciple has only knowledge about this that is
independent of others: 'When this exists, that is; due to the arising of
this, that arises. When ignorance exists choices come to be. When
choices exist consciousness comes to be. When consciousness exists name
and form come to be. When name and form exist the six sense fields come
to be. When the six sense fields exist contact comes to be. When contact
exists feeling comes to be. When feeling exists craving comes to be.
When craving exists grasping comes to be. When grasping exists continued
existence comes to be. When continued existence exists rebirth comes to
be. When rebirth exists old age and death come to be.' They understand:
'This is the origin of the world.'

A learned noble disciple doesn't think: 'When what doesn't exist, what
is not? Due to the cessation of what, what ceases? When what doesn't
exist do choices not come to be? When what doesn't exist do name and
form not come to be? When what doesn't exist do the six sense fields ...
contact ... feeling ... craving ... grasping ... continued existence ...
rebirth ... old age and death not come to be?'

Rather, a learned noble disciple has only knowledge about this that is
independent of others: 'When this doesn't exist, that is not; due to the
cessation of this, that ceases. When ignorance doesn't exist choices
don't come to be. When choices don't exist consciousness doesn't come to
be. When consciousness doesn't exist name and form don't come to be.
When name and form don't exist the six sense fields don't come to be.
... continued existence doesn't come to be ... rebirth doesn't come to
be ... When rebirth doesn't exist old age and death don't come to be.'
They understand: 'This is the cessation of the world.'

A noble disciple comes to understand the world, its origin, its
cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation. Such a noble
disciple is one who is called 'one accomplished in view', 'one
accomplished in vision', 'one who has come to the true teaching', 'one
who sees this true teaching', 'one endowed with a trainee's knowledge',
'one who has entered the stream of the teaching', 'a noble one with
penetrative wisdom', and also 'one who stands knocking at the door to
freedom from death'."

### N 12.50 A Noble Disciple (2nd) *Dutiyaariyasāvakasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, a learned noble disciple doesn't think: 'When what exists,

## The Chapter on Suffering

### N 12.51 An Inquiry *Parivīmaṁsanasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, when a mendicant is inquiring, how do you define when they
are inquiring for the complete ending of suffering?"

"Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge.
Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The
mendicants will listen and remember it."

"Well then, mendicants, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, take a mendicant who makes an inquiry: 'The suffering that
arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and
diverse forms. What is the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of
this suffering? When what exists do old age and death come to be? When
what does not exist do old age and death not come to be?' While making
an inquiry they understand: 'The suffering that arises in the world
starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms. The source
of this suffering is rebirth. When rebirth exists, old age and death
come to be. When rebirth doesn't exist, old age and death don't come to
be.'

They understand old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and
the fitting practice for their cessation. And they practice in line with
that path. This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete
ending of suffering, for the cessation of old age and death.

Then they inquire further: 'But what is the source of this rebirth? When
what exists does rebirth come to be? And when what does not exist does
rebirth not come to be?' While making an inquiry they understand:
'Continued existence is the source of rebirth. When continued existence
exists, rebirth comes to be. When continued existence does not exist,
rebirth doesn't come to be.'

They understand rebirth, its origin, its cessation, and the fitting
practice for its cessation. And they practice in line with that path.
This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of
suffering, for the cessation of rebirth.

Then they inquire further: 'But what is the source of this continued
existence? ...' ... 'But what is the source of this grasping? ...' ...
'But what is the source of this craving? ...' ... 'But what is the
source of this feeling? ...' ... 'But what is the source of this
contact? ...' ... 'But what is the source of these six sense fields?
...' ... 'But what is the source of this name and form? ...' ... 'But
what is the source of this consciousness? ...' ... 'But what is the
source of these choices? When what exists do choices come to be? When
what does not exist do choices not come to be?' While making an inquiry
they understand: 'Ignorance is the source of choices. When ignorance
exists, choices come to be. When ignorance does not exist, choices don't
come to be.'

They understand choices, their origin, their cessation, and the fitting
practice for their cessation. And they practice in line with that path.
This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of
suffering, for the cessation of choices.

If an ignorant individual makes a good choice, their consciousness
enters a good realm. If they make a bad choice, their consciousness
enters a bad realm. If they make an imperturbable choice, their
consciousness enters an imperturbable realm. When a mendicant has given
up ignorance and given rise to knowledge, they don't make a good choice,
a bad choice, or an imperturbable choice. Not choosing or intending,
they don't grasp at anything in the world. Not grasping, they're not
anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.

They understand: 'Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been
completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further
for this place.'

If they feel a pleasant feeling, they understand that it's impermanent,
that they're not attached to it, and that they don't take pleasure in
it. If they feel a painful feeling, they understand that it's
impermanent, that they're not attached to it, and that they don't take
pleasure in it. If they feel a neutral feeling, they understand that
it's impermanent, that they're not attached to it, and that they don't
take pleasure in it. If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it
detached. If they feel a painful feeling, they feel it detached. If they
feel a neutral feeling, they feel it detached.

Feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: 'I feel the
end of the body approaching.' Feeling the end of life approaching, they
understand: 'I feel the end of life approaching.' They understand: 'When
my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that's
felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right
here. Only bodily remains will be left.'

Suppose a person were to remove a hot clay pot from a potter's kiln and
place it down on level ground. Its heat would dissipate right there, and
the shards would be left behind.

In the same way, feeling the end of the body approaching, they
understand: 'I feel the end of the body approaching.' Feeling the end of
life approaching, they understand: 'I feel the end of life approaching.'
They understand: 'When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end,
everything that's felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will
become cool right here. Only bodily remains will be left.'

What do you think, mendicants? Would a mendicant who has ended the
defilements still make good choices, bad choices, or imperturbable
choices?"

"No, sir."

"And when there are no choices at all, with the cessation of choices,
would consciousness still be found?"

"No, sir."

"And when there's no consciousness at all, would name and form still be
found?"

"No, sir."

"And when there are no name and form at all, would the six sense fields
still be found?"

"No, sir."

"And when there are no six sense fields at all, would contact still be
found?"

"No, sir."

"And when there's no contact at all, would feeling still be found?"

"No, sir."

"And when there's no feeling at all, would craving still be found?"

"No, sir."

"And when there's no craving at all, would grasping still be found?"

"No, sir."

"And when there's no grasping at all, would continued existence still be
found?"

"No, sir."

"And when there's no continued existence at all, would rebirth still be
found?"

"No, sir."

"And when there's no rebirth at all, would old age and death still be
found?"

"No, sir."

"Good, good, mendicants! That's how it is, not otherwise. Trust me on
this, mendicants; be convinced. Have no doubts or uncertainties in this
matter. Just this is the end of suffering."

### N 12.52 Grasping *Upādānasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"There are things that fuel grasping. When you concentrate on the
gratification provided by these things, your craving grows. Craving is a
condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence.
Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition
for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress
to come to be. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.

Suppose a great mass of fire was burning with ten, twenty, thirty, or
forty loads of wood. And from time to time someone would toss in dry
grass, cow dung, or wood. Fed and fuelled by that, the bonfire would
burn for a long time.

In the same way, there are things that fuel grasping. When you
concentrate on the gratification provided by these things, your craving
grows. Craving is a condition for grasping. ... That is how this entire
mass of suffering originates.

There are things that fuel grasping. When you concentrate on the
drawbacks of these things, your craving ceases. When craving ceases,
grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When
continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age
and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease. That
is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.

Suppose a great mass of fire was burning with ten, twenty, thirty, or
forty loads of wood. And no-one would toss in dry grass, cow dung, or
wood from time to time. As the original fuel is used up and no more is
added, the great mass of fire would be extinguished due to not being
fed.

In the same way, there are things that fuel grasping. When you
concentrate on the drawbacks of these things, your craving ceases. When
craving ceases, grasping ceases. ... That is how this entire mass of
suffering ceases."

### N 12.53 Fetters *Saṁyojanasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"There are things that are prone to being fettered. When you concentrate
on the gratification provided by these things, your craving grows.
Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for
continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth.
Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain,
sadness, and distress to come to be. That is how this entire mass of
suffering originates.

Suppose an oil lamp depended on oil and a wick to burn. And from time to
time someone would pour oil in and adjust the wick. Fed and fuelled by
that, the oil lamp would burn for a long time.

In the same way, there are things that are prone to being fettered. When
you concentrate on the gratification provided by these things, your
craving grows. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a
condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition
for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow,
lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. That is how this
entire mass of suffering originates.

There are things that are prone to being fettered. When you concentrate
on the drawbacks of these things, your craving ceases. When craving
ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued existence
ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth
ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and
distress cease. That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.

Suppose an oil lamp depended on oil and a wick to burn. And no-one would
pour oil in and adjust the wick from time to time. As the original fuel
is used up and no more is added, the oil lamp would be extinguished due
to not being fed.

In the same way, there are things that are prone to being fettered. When
you concentrate on the drawbacks of these things, your craving ceases.
When craving ceases, grasping ceases. ... That is how this entire mass
of suffering ceases."

### N 12.54 Fetters (2nd) *Dutiyasaṁyojanasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, suppose an oil lamp depended on oil and a wick to burn. And

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the
Kuru town named Kammāsadamma. Then Venerable Ānanda went up
to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:

"It's incredible, sir! It's amazing, in that this dependent origination
is deep and appears deep, yet to me it seems as plain as can be."

"Not so, Ānanda! Not so, Ānanda! This dependent origination is deep and
appears deep. It is because of not understanding and not penetrating
this teaching that this population has become tangled like string,
knotted like a ball of thread, and matted like rushes and reeds, and it
doesn't escape the places of loss, the bad places, the underworld,
transmigration.

There are things that fuel grasping. When you concentrate on the
gratification provided by these things, your craving grows. Craving is a
condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence.
Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition
for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress
to come to be. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.

## The Great Chapter

### N 12.61 Unlearned *Assutavāsutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. ...

"Mendicants, when it comes to this body made up of the four principal
states, an unlearned ordinary person might become disillusioned,
dispassionate, and freed. Why is that? This body made up of the four
principal states is seen to accumulate and disperse, to be taken up and
laid to rest. That's why, when it comes to this body, an unlearned
ordinary person might become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed.

But when it comes to that which is called 'mind' and also 'sentience'
and also 'consciousness', an unlearned ordinary person is unable to
become disillusioned, dispassionate, or freed. Why is that? Because for
a long time they've been attached to it, thought of it as their own, and
mistaken it: 'This is mine, I am this, this is my self.' That's why,
when it comes to this mind, an unlearned ordinary person is unable to
become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed.

But an unlearned ordinary person would be better off taking this body
made up of the four principal states to be their self, rather than the
mind. Why is that? This body made up of the four principal states is
seen to last for a year, or for two, three, four, five, ten, twenty,
thirty, forty, fifty, or a hundred years, or even longer.

But that which is called 'mind' and also 'sentience' and also
'consciousness' arises as one thing and ceases as another all day and
all night. It's like a monkey moving through the forest. It grabs hold
of one branch, lets it go, and grabs another; then it lets that go and
grabs yet another. In the same way, that which is called 'mind' and also
'sentience' and also 'consciousness' arises as one thing and ceases as
another all day and all night.

In this case, a learned noble disciple carefully and rationally applies
the mind to dependent origination itself: 'When this exists, that is;
due to the arising of this, that arises. When this doesn't exist, that
is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases. That is: Ignorance is
a condition for choices.

Choices are a condition for consciousness. ... That is how this entire
mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with
nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness
ceases. ... That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.'

Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form,
feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. Being disillusioned,
desire fades away. When desire fades away they're freed. When they're
freed, they know they're freed.

They understand: 'Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been
completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further
for this place.'"

### N 12.62 Unlearned (2nd) *Dutiyaassutavāsutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, when it comes to this body made up of the four principal

feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant.
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as pleasant, the
corresponding pleasant feeling ceases and stops. Painful feeling arises
dependent on a contact to be experienced as painful. With the cessation
of that contact to be experienced as painful, the corresponding painful
feeling ceases and stops. Neutral feeling arises dependent on a contact
to be experienced as neutral. With the cessation of that contact to be
experienced as neutral, the corresponding neutral feeling ceases and
stops.

When you rub two sticks together, heat is generated and fire is
produced. But when you part the sticks and lay them aside, any
corresponding heat ceases and stops. In the same way, pleasant feeling
arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant. With the
cessation of that contact to be experienced as pleasant, the
corresponding pleasant feeling ceases and stops. Painful feeling ...
Neutral feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as
neutral. With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as
neutral, the corresponding neutral feeling ceases and stops.

freed, they know they're freed.

### N 12.63 A Child's Flesh *Puttamaṁsasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, there are these four fuels. They maintain sentient beings
that have been born and help those that are about to be born. What four?
Solid food, whether solid or subtle; contact is the second, mental
intention the third, and consciousness the fourth. These are the four
fuels that maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those
that are about to be born.

And how should you regard solid food? Suppose a couple who were husband
and wife set out to cross a desert, taking limited supplies. They had an
only child, dear and beloved. As the couple were crossing the desert
their limited quantity of supplies would run out, and they'd still have
the rest of the desert to cross. Then it would occur to that couple:
'Our limited quantity of supplies has run out, and we still have the
rest of the desert to cross. Why don't we kill our only child, so dear
and beloved, and prepare dried and spiced meat? Then we can make it
across the desert by eating our child's flesh. Let not all three
perish.' Then that couple would kill their only child, so dear and
beloved, and prepare dried and spiced meat. They'd make it across the
desert by eating their child's flesh. And as they'd eat their child's
flesh, they'd beat their breasts and cry: 'Where are you, our only
child? Where are you, our only child?'

What do you think, mendicants? Would they eat that food for fun,
indulgence, adornment, or decoration?"

"No, sir."

"Wouldn't they eat that food just so they could make it across the
desert?"

"Yes, sir."

"I say that this is how you should regard solid food. When solid food is
completely understood, desire for the five kinds of sensual stimulation
is completely understood. When desire for the five kinds of sensual
stimulation is completely understood, a noble disciple is bound by no
fetter that might return them again to this world.

And how should you regard contact as fuel? Suppose there was a flayed
cow. If she stands by a wall, the creatures on the wall bite her. If she
stands under a tree, the creatures in the tree bite her. If she stands
in some water, the creatures in the water bite her. If she stands in the
open, the creatures in the open bite her. Wherever that flayed cow
stands, the creatures there would bite her. I say that this is how you
should regard contact as fuel. When contact as fuel is completely
understood, the three feelings are completely understood. When the three
feelings are completely understood, a noble disciple has nothing further
to do, I say.

And how should you regard mental intention as fuel? Suppose there was a
pit of glowing coals deeper than a man's height, filled with glowing
coals that neither flamed nor smoked. Then a person would come along who
wants to live and doesn't want to die, who wants to be happy and recoils
from pain. Two strong men would grab them by the arms and drag them
towards the pit of glowing coals. Then that person's intention, aim, and
wish would be to get far away. Why is that? Because that person would
think: 'If I fall in that pit of glowing coals, that will result in my
death or deadly pain.' I say that this is how you should regard mental
intention as fuel. When mental intention as fuel is completely
understood, the three cravings are completely understood. When the three
cravings are completely understood, a noble disciple has nothing further
to do, I say.

And how should you regard consciousness as fuel? Suppose they were to
arrest a bandit, a criminal and present him to the king, saying: 'Your
Majesty, this is a bandit, a criminal. Punish him as you will.' The king
would say: 'Go, my men, and strike this man in the morning with a
hundred spears!' The king's men did as they were told. Then at midday
the king would say: 'My men, how is that man?' 'He's still alive, Your
Majesty.' The king would say: 'Go, my men, and strike this man in the
middle of the day with a hundred spears!' The king's men did as they
were told. Then late in the afternoon the king would say: 'My men, how
is that man?' 'He's still alive, Your Majesty.' The king would say: 'Go,
my men, and strike this man in the late afternoon with a hundred
spears!' The king's men did as they were told.

What do you think, mendicants? Would that man experience pain and
distress from being struck with three hundred spears a day?"

"Sir, that man would experience pain and distress from being struck with
one spear, let alone three hundred spears!"

"I say that this is how you should regard consciousness as fuel. When
consciousness as fuel is completely understood, name and form is
completely understood. When name and form are completely understood, a
noble disciple has nothing further to do, I say."

### N 12.64 If There Is Desire *Atthirāgasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, there are these four fuels. They maintain sentient beings
that have been born and help those that are about to be born. What four?
Solid food, whether solid or subtle; contact is the second, mental
intention the third, and consciousness the fourth. These are the four
fuels that maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those
that are about to be born.

If there is desire, relishing, and craving for solid food, consciousness
becomes established there and grows. Where consciousness is established
and grows, name and form are conceived. Where name and form are
conceived, there is the growth of choices. Where choices grow, there is
rebirth into a new state of existence in the future. Where there is
rebirth into a new state of existence in the future, there is rebirth,
old age, and death in the future. Where there is rebirth, old age, and
death in the future, I say this is full of sorrow, anguish, and
distress.

If there is desire, relishing, and craving for contact as fuel ... If
there is desire, relishing, and craving for mental intention as fuel ...
If there is desire, relishing, and craving for consciousness as fuel,
consciousness becomes established there and grows. Where consciousness
is established and grows, name and form are conceived. Where name and
form are conceived, there is the growth of choices. Where choices grow,
there is rebirth into a new state of existence in the future. Where
there is rebirth into a new state of existence in the future, there is
rebirth, old age, and death in the future. Where there is rebirth, old
age, and death in the future, I say this is full of sorrow, anguish, and
distress.

Suppose an artist or painter had some dye, red lac, turmeric, indigo, or
rose madder. And on a polished plank or a wall or a canvas they'd create
the form of a woman or a man, whole in its major and minor limbs.

In the same way, if there is desire, relishing, and craving for solid
food, consciousness becomes established there and grows. Where
consciousness is established and grows, name and form are conceived.
Where name and form are conceived, there is the growth of choices. Where
choices grow, there is rebirth into a new state of existence in the
future. Where there is rebirth into a new state of existence in the
future, there is rebirth, old age, and death in the future. Where there
is rebirth, old age, and death in the future, I say this is full of
sorrow, anguish, and distress.

If there is desire, relishing, and craving for contact as fuel ... If
there is desire, relishing, and craving for mental intention as fuel ...
If there is desire, relishing, and craving for consciousness as fuel,
consciousness becomes established there and grows. Where consciousness
is established and grows, name and form are conceived. Where name and
form are conceived, there is the growth of choices. Where choices grow,
there is rebirth into a new state of existence in the future. Where
there is rebirth into a new state of existence in the future, there is
rebirth, old age, and death in the future. Where there is rebirth, old
age, and death in the future, I say this is full of sorrow, anguish, and
distress.

If there is no desire, relishing, and craving for solid food,
consciousness does not become established there and doesn't grow. Where
consciousness is not established and doesn't grow, name and form are not
conceived. Where name and form are not conceived, there is no growth of
choices. Where choices don't grow, there is no rebirth into a new state
of existence in the future. Where there is no rebirth into a new state
of existence in the future, there is no rebirth, old age, and death in
the future. Where there is no rebirth, old age, and death in the future,
I say there's no sorrow, anguish, and distress.

If there is no desire, relishing, and craving for contact as fuel ... If
there is no desire, relishing, and craving for mental intention as fuel
... If there is no desire, relishing, and craving for consciousness as
fuel, consciousness doesn't become established there and doesn't grow.
Where consciousness is not established and doesn't grow, name and form
are not conceived. Where name and form are not conceived, there is no
growth of choices. Where choices don't grow, there is no rebirth into a
new state of existence in the future. Where there is no rebirth into a
new state of existence in the future, there is no rebirth, old age, and
death in the future. Where there is no rebirth, old age, and death in
the future, I say there's no sorrow, anguish, and distress.

Suppose there was a bungalow or a hall with a peaked roof, with windows
on the northern, southern, or eastern side. When the sun rises and a ray
of light enters through a window, where would it land?"

"On the western wall, sir."

"If there was no western wall, where would it land?"

"On the ground, sir."

"If there was no ground, where would it land?"

"In water, sir."

"If there was no water, where would it land?"

"It wouldn't land, sir."

"In the same way, if there is no desire, relishing, and craving for
solid food, consciousness does not become established there and doesn't
grow. ...

If there is no desire, relishing, and craving for contact as fuel ... If
there is no desire, relishing, and craving for mental intention as fuel
... If there is no desire, relishing, and craving for consciousness as
fuel, consciousness doesn't become established there and doesn't grow.
Where consciousness is not established and doesn't grow, name and form
are not conceived. Where name and form are not conceived, there is no
growth of choices. Where choices don't grow, there is no rebirth into a
new state of existence in the future. Where there is no rebirth into a
new state of existence in the future, there is no rebirth, old age, and
death in the future. Where there is no rebirth, old age, and death in
the future, I say there's no sorrow, anguish, and distress."

### N 12.65 The City *Nagarasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, before my awakening---when I was still unawakened but
intent on awakening---I thought: 'Alas, this world has fallen into
trouble. It's born, grows old, dies, passes away, and is reborn, yet it
doesn't understand how to escape from this suffering, from old age and
death. Oh, when will an escape be found from this suffering, from old
age and death?' Then it occurred to me: 'When what exists is there old
age and death? What is a condition for old age and death?' Then, through
rational application of mind, I comprehended with wisdom: 'When rebirth
exists there's old age and death. Rebirth is a condition for old age and
death.'

Then it occurred to me: 'When what exists is there rebirth? ...
continued existence ... grasping ... craving ... feeling ... contact ...
the six sense fields ... name and form ... What is a condition for name
and form?' Then, through rational application of mind, I comprehended
with wisdom: 'When consciousness exists there are name and form.
Consciousness is a condition for name and form.' Then it occurred to me:
'When what exists is there consciousness? What is a condition for
consciousness?' Then, through rational application of mind, I
comprehended with wisdom: 'When name and form exist there's
consciousness. Name and form are a condition for consciousness.'

Then it occurred to me: This consciousness turns back from name and
form, and doesn't go beyond that. This is the extent to which one may be
reborn, grow old, die, pass away, or reappear. That is: name and form
are conditions for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name
and form. Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields. The six
sense fields are conditions for contact. ... That is how this entire
mass of suffering originates. 'Origination, origination.' Such was the
vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me
regarding teachings not learned before from another.

Then it occurred to me: 'When what doesn't exist is there no old age and
death? When what ceases do old age and death cease?' Then, through
rational application of mind, I comprehended with wisdom: 'When rebirth
doesn't exist there is no old age and death. When rebirth ceases old age
and death cease.' Then it occurred to me: 'When what doesn't exist is
there no rebirth ... continued existence ... grasping ... craving ...
feeling ... contact ... six sense fields ... name and form? When what
ceases do name and form cease?' Then, through rational application of
mind, I comprehended with wisdom: 'When consciousness doesn't exist
there is no name and form. When consciousness ceases name and form
cease.'

Then it occurred to me: 'When what doesn't exist is there no
consciousness? When what ceases does consciousness cease?' Then, through
rational application of mind, I comprehended with wisdom: 'When name and
form don't exist, there is no consciousness. When name and form cease,
consciousness ceases.'

Then it occurred to me: I have discovered the path to awakening. That
is: When name and form cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness
ceases, name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six sense
fields cease. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. ... That
is how this entire mass of suffering ceases. 'Cessation, cessation.'
Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that
arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from another.

Suppose a person was walking through a forest. They'd see an ancient
path, an ancient route traveled by humans in the past. Following it
along, they'd see an ancient city, an ancient capital, inhabited by
humans in the past. It was lovely, complete with parks, groves, lotus
ponds, and embankments. Then that person would inform a king or their
chief minister: 'Please sir, you should know this. While walking through
a forest I saw an ancient path, an ancient route traveled by humans in
the past. Following it along I saw an ancient city, an ancient capital,
inhabited by humans in the past. It was lovely, complete with parks,
groves, lotus ponds, and embankments. Sir, you should rebuild that
city!' Then that king or their chief minister would have that city
rebuilt. And after some time that city was successful and prosperous,
populous, full of people, attained to growth and expansion. In the same
way, I saw an ancient path, an ancient route traveled by fully awakened
Buddhas in the past.

And what is that ancient path, the ancient route traveled by fully
awakened Buddhas in the past? It is simply this noble eightfold path,
that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right
livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. This
is that ancient path, the ancient route traveled by fully awakened
Buddhas in the past.

Following it along, I directly knew old age and death, their origin,
their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation.
Following it along, I directly knew rebirth ... continued existence ...
grasping ... craving ... feeling ... contact ... the six sense fields
... name and form ... consciousness ... Following it along, I directly
knew choices, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads
to their cessation.

Having directly known this, I told the monks, nuns, laymen, and
laywomen. And that's how this spiritual life has become successful and
prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever
there are gods and humans."

### N 12.66 Self-examination *Sammasasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in the
land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, do you perform inner self-examination?"

When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha, "Sir, I
perform inner self-examination."

"But mendicant, how do you perform inner self-examination?" Then that
mendicant answered, but the Buddha was not happy with the answer.

When he had spoken, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, "Now is the
time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! Let the Buddha speak of
the inner self-examination. The mendicants will listen and remember it."

"Well then, Ānanda, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Take a mendicant who performs inner self-examination: 'The suffering
that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and
diverse forms. But what is the source of this suffering? When what
exists do old age and death come to be? And when what does not exist do
old age and death not come to be?' While examining they know: 'The
suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes
many and diverse forms. The source of this suffering is attachment. When
attachments exist old age and death come to be. And when attachments do
not exist old age and death don't come to be.' They understand old age
and death, their origin, their cessation, and the fitting practice for
their cessation. And they practice in line with that path. This is
called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of
suffering, for the cessation of old age and death.

They perform further inner self-examination: 'But what is the source of
this attachment? When what exists does attachment come to be? And when
what does not exist does attachment not come to be?' While examining
they know: 'The source of this attachment is craving. When craving
exists attachments come to be. And when craving doesn't exist
attachments don't come to be.' They understand attachments, their
origin, their cessation, and the fitting practice for their cessation.
And they practice in line with that path. This is called a mendicant who
is practicing for the complete ending of suffering, for the cessation of
attachments.

They perform further inner self-examination: 'But where does that
craving arise and where does it settle?' While examining they know:
'That craving arises and settles on whatever in the world seems nice and
pleasant. And what in the world seems nice and pleasant? The eye in the
world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and
settles. The ear ... nose ... tongue ... body ... mind in the world
seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and
settles.'

There were ascetics and brahmins of the past who saw the things that
seem nice and pleasant in the world as permanent, as pleasurable, as
self, as healthy, and as safe. Their craving grew. As their craving
grew, their attachments grew. As their attachments grew, their suffering
grew. And as their suffering grew, they were not freed from rebirth, old
age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
They were not freed from suffering, I say.

There will be ascetics and brahmins in the future who will see the
things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as permanent, as
pleasurable, as self, as healthy, and as safe. Their craving will grow.
As their craving grows, their attachments will grow. As their
attachments grow, their suffering will grow. And as their suffering
grows, they will not be freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from
sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They will not be freed
from suffering, I say.

There are ascetics and brahmins in the present who see the things that
seem nice and pleasant in the world as permanent, as pleasurable, as
self, as healthy, and as safe. Their craving grows. As their craving
grows, their attachments grow. As their attachments grow, their
suffering grows. And as their suffering grows, they are not freed from
rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness,
and distress. They are not freed from suffering, I say.

Suppose there was a bronze goblet of beverage that had a nice color,
aroma, and flavor. But it was mixed with poison. Then along comes a man
struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. They'd
say to him: 'Here, worthy man, this bronze goblet of beverage has a nice
color, aroma, and flavor. But it's mixed with poison. Drink it if you
like. If you drink it, the color, aroma, and flavor will be appetizing,
but it will result in death or deadly pain.' He wouldn't reject that
beverage. Hastily, without reflection, he'd drink it, resulting in death
or deadly pain.

In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins of the past ... future
... There are ascetics and brahmins in the present who see the things
that seem nice and pleasant in the world as permanent, as pleasurable,
as self, as healthy, and as safe. Their craving grows. As their craving
grows, their attachments grow. As their attachments grow, their
suffering grows. And as their suffering grows, they are not freed from
rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness,
and distress. They are not freed from suffering, I say.

There were ascetics and brahmins of the past who saw the things that
seem nice and pleasant in the world as impermanent, as suffering, as
not-self, as diseased, and as dangerous. They gave up craving. Giving up
craving, they gave up attachments. Giving up attachments, they gave up
suffering. Giving up suffering, they were freed from rebirth, old age,
and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They
were freed from suffering, I say.

There will be ascetics and brahmins in the future who will see the
things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as impermanent, as
suffering, as not-self, as diseased, and as dangerous. They will give up
craving. Giving up craving ... they will be freed from suffering, I say.

There are ascetics and brahmins in the present who see the things that
seem nice and pleasant in the world as impermanent, as suffering, as
not-self, as diseased, and as dangerous. They give up craving. Giving up
craving, they give up attachments. Giving up attachments, they give up
suffering. Giving up suffering, they are freed from rebirth, old age,
and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They
are freed from suffering, I say.

Suppose there was a bronze goblet of beverage that had a nice color,
aroma, and flavor. But it was mixed with poison. Then along comes a man
struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. They'd
say to him: 'Here, worthy man, this bronze goblet of beverage has a nice
color, aroma, and flavor. But it's mixed with poison. Drink it if you
like. If you drink it, its nice color, aroma, and flavor will refresh
you. But drinking it will result in death or deadly pain.' Then that man
might think: 'I could quench my thirst with water, whey, seasoned drink,
or broth. But I shouldn't drink that beverage, for it would be for my
lasting harm and suffering.' He'd reject that beverage. After appraisal,
he wouldn't drink it, and it wouldn't result in death or deadly pain.

In the same way, there were ascetics and brahmins of the past who saw
the things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as impermanent, as
suffering, as not-self, as diseased, and as dangerous. They gave up
craving. Giving up craving, they gave up attachments. Giving up
attachments, they gave up suffering. Giving up suffering, they were
freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain,
sadness, and distress. They were freed from suffering, I say.

There will be ascetics and brahmins in the future ... There are ascetics
and brahmins in the present who see the things that seem nice and
pleasant in the world as impermanent, as suffering, as not-self, as
diseased, and as dangerous. They give up craving. Giving up craving,
they give up attachments. Giving up attachments, they give up suffering.
Giving up suffering, they are freed from rebirth, old age, and death,
from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They are freed
from suffering, I say."

### N 12.67 Bundles of Reeds *Naḷakalāpīsutta*

At one time Venerable Sāriputta and Venerable
Mahākoṭṭhita were staying near Varanasi, in the deer park
at Isipatana.

Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita came out
of retreat, went to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged
greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were
over, he sat down to one side and said to Sāriputta:

"Well, Reverend Sāriputta, are old age and death made by
oneself? Or by another? Or by both oneself and another? Or do they arise
by chance, not made by oneself or another?"

"No, Reverend Koṭṭhita, old age and death are not made by
oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor do they
arise by chance, not made by oneself or another. Rather, rebirth is a
condition for old age and death."

"Well, Reverend Sāriputta, is rebirth made by oneself? Or
by another? Or by both oneself and another? Or does it arise by chance,
not made by oneself or another?"

"No, Reverend Koṭṭhita, rebirth is not made by oneself, nor
by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor does it arise by
chance, not made by oneself or another. Rather, continued existence is a
condition for rebirth."

"Well, Reverend Sāriputta, is continued existence made by
oneself? ..." ... "Is grasping made by oneself? ..." ... "Is craving
made by oneself? ..." ... "Is feeling made by oneself? ..." ... "Is
contact made by oneself? ..." ... "Are the six sense fields made by
oneself? ..." ... "Well, Reverend Sāriputta, are name and
form made by oneself? Or by another? Or by both oneself and another? Or
do they arise by chance, not made by oneself or another?"

"No, Reverend Koṭṭhita, name and form are not made by
oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor do they
arise by chance, not made by oneself or another. Rather, consciousness
is a condition for name and form."

"Well, Reverend Sāriputta, is consciousness made by
oneself? Or by another? Or by both oneself and another? Or does it arise
by chance, not made by oneself or another?"

"No, Reverend Koṭṭhita, consciousness is not made by
oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor does it
arise by chance, not made by oneself or another. Rather, name and form
are conditions for consciousness."

"Just now I understood you to say: 'No, Reverend Koṭṭhita,
name and form are not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both
oneself and another, nor do they arise by chance, not made by oneself or
another. Rather, consciousness is a condition for name and form.'

But I also understood you to say: 'No, Reverend Koṭṭhita,
consciousness is not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both
oneself and another, nor does it arise by chance, not made by oneself or
another. Rather, name and form are conditions for consciousness.'

How then should we see the meaning of this statement?"

"Well then, reverend, I shall give you a simile. For by means of a
simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said.
Suppose there were two bundles of reeds leaning up against each other.

In the same way, name and form are conditions for consciousness.
Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are
conditions for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions
for contact. ... That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
If the first of those bundles of reeds were to be pulled away, the other
would collapse. And if the other were to be pulled away, the first would
collapse.

In the same way, when name and form cease, consciousness ceases. When
consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and form cease, the
six sense fields cease. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases.
... That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases."

"It's incredible, Reverend Sāriputta, it's amazing! How
well spoken this was by Venerable Sāriputta! And we can
express our agreement with Venerable Sāriputta's statement
on these thirty-six grounds.

If a mendicant teaches Dhamma for disillusionment, dispassion, and
cessation regarding old age and death, they're qualified to be called a
'mendicant who speaks on Dhamma'. If they practice for disillusionment,
dispassion, and cessation regarding old age and death, they're qualified
to be called a 'mendicant who practices in line with the teaching'. If
they're freed by not grasping by disillusionment, dispassion, and
cessation regarding old age and death, they're qualified to be called a
'mendicant who has attained extinguishment in this very life'. If a
mendicant teaches Dhamma for disillusionment regarding rebirth ...
continued existence ... grasping ... craving ... feeling ... contact ...
the six sense fields ... name and form ... consciousness ... choices ...
If a mendicant teaches Dhamma for disillusionment, dispassion, and
cessation regarding ignorance, they're qualified to be called a
'mendicant who speaks on Dhamma'. If they practice for disillusionment,
dispassion, and cessation regarding ignorance, they're qualified to be
called a 'mendicant who practices in line with the teaching'. If they're
freed by not grasping by disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation
regarding ignorance, they're qualified to be called a 'mendicant who has
attained extinguishment in this very life'."

### N 12.68 At Kosambī *Kosambisutta*

At one time the venerables Musīla, Saviṭṭha,
Nārada, and Ānanda were staying near Kosambī
in Ghosita's monastery. Then Venerable Saviṭṭha said to
Venerable Musīla:

"Reverend Musīla, apart from faith, endorsement, oral
transmission, reasoned train of thought, or acceptance of a view after
deliberation, do you know for yourself that rebirth is a condition for
old age and death?"

"Reverend Saviṭṭha, apart from faith, endorsement, oral
transmission, reasoned train of thought, or acceptance of a view after
deliberation, I know and see that rebirth is a condition for old age and
death."

"Reverend Musīla, apart from faith, endorsement, oral
transmission, reasoned train of thought, or acceptance of a view after
deliberateation, do you know for yourself that continued existence is a
condition for rebirth ... grasping is a condition for continued
existence ... craving is a condition for grasping ... feeling is a
condition for craving ... contact is a condition for feeling ... the six
sense fields are conditions for contact ... name and form are conditions
for the six sense fields ... consciousness is a condition for name and
form ... choices are a condition for consciousness ... ignorance is a
condition for choices?"

"Reverend Saviṭṭha, apart from faith, endorsement, oral
transmission, reasoned train of thought, or acceptance of a view after
deliberation, I know and see that ignorance is a condition for choices."

"Reverend Musīla, apart from faith, endorsement, oral
transmission, reasoned train of thought, or acceptance of a view after
deliberation, do you know for yourself that when rebirth ceases, old age
and death cease?"

"Reverend Saviṭṭha, apart from faith, endorsement, oral
transmission, reasoned train of thought, or acceptance of a view after
deliberation, I know and see that when rebirth ceases, old age and death
cease."

"Reverend Musīla, apart from faith, endorsement, oral
transmission, reasoned train of thought, or acceptance of a view after
deliberation, do you know for yourself that when continued existence
ceases, rebirth ceases ... when grasping ceases, continued existence
ceases ... when craving ceases, grasping ceases ... when feeling ceases,
craving ceases ... when contact ceases, feeling ceases ... when the six
sense fields cease, contact ceases ... when name and form cease, the six
sense fields cease ... when consciousness ceases name and form cease ...
when choices cease consciousness ceases ... when ignorance ceases,
choices cease?"

"Reverend Saviṭṭha, apart from faith, endorsement, oral
transmission, reasoned train of thought, or acceptance of a view after
deliberation, I know and see that when ignorance ceases, choices cease."

"Reverend Musīla, apart from faith, endorsement, oral
transmission, reasoned train of thought, or acceptance of a view after
deliberation, do you know for yourself that the cessation of continued
existence is extinguishment?"

"Reverend Saviṭṭha, apart from faith, endorsement, oral
transmission, reasoned train of thought, or acceptance of a view after
deliberation, I know and see that the cessation of continued existence
is extinguishment."

"Then Venerable Musīla is a perfected one, with defilements
ended." When he said this, Musīla kept silent.

Then Venerable Nārada said to Venerable
Saviṭṭha, "Reverend Saviṭṭha, please let me
answer these questions. Ask me and I will answer them for you."

"By all means, Venerable Nārada, try these questions. I'll
ask you and you can answer them for me."

(Saviṭṭha repeats exactly the same series of questions, and
Nārada answers just as Musīla did.)

"Reverend Nārada, apart from faith, endorsement, oral
transmission, reasoned train of thought, or acceptance of a view after
deliberation, do you know for yourself that the cessation of continued
existence is extinguishment?"

"Reverend Saviṭṭha, apart from faith, endorsement, oral
transmission, reasoned train of thought, or acceptance of a view after
deliberation, I know and see that the cessation of continued existence
is extinguishment."

"Then Venerable Nārada is a perfected one, with defilements
ended."

"I have truly seen clearly with right wisdom that the cessation of
continued existence is extinguishment. Yet I am not a perfected one.
Suppose there was a well on a desert road that had neither rope nor
bucket. Then along comes a person struggling in the oppressive heat,
weary, thirsty, and parched. They'd know that there was water, but they
couldn't physically touch it.

In the same way, I have truly seen clearly with right wisdom that the
cessation of continued existence is extinguishment. Yet I am not a
perfected one."

When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to Venerable
Saviṭṭha, "Reverend Saviṭṭha, what do you have
to say to Venerable Nārada when he speaks like this?"

"Reverend Ānanda, I have nothing to say to Venerable Nārada
when he speaks like this, except what is good and wholesome."

### N 12.69 Surge *Upayantisutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery.

"Mendicants, when the ocean surges it makes the rivers surge. When the
rivers surge they make the streams surge. When the streams surge they
make the lakes surge. When the lakes surge they make the ponds surge.

In the same way, when ignorance surges it makes choices surge. When
choices surge they make consciousness surge. When consciousness surges
it makes name and form surge. When name and form surge they make the six
sense fields surge. When the six sense fields surge they make contact
surge. When contact surges it makes feeling surge. When feeling surges
it makes craving surge. When craving surges it makes grasping surge.
When grasping surges it makes continued existence surge. When continued
existence surges it makes rebirth surge. When rebirth surges it makes
old age and death surge.

When the ocean recedes it makes the rivers recede. When the rivers
recede they make the streams recede. When the streams recede they make
the lakes recede. When the lakes recede they make the ponds recede.

In the same way, when ignorance recedes it makes choices recede. When
choices recede they make consciousness recede. When consciousness
recedes it makes name and form recede. When name and form recede they
make the six sense fields recede. When the six sense fields recede they
make contact recede. When contact recedes it makes feeling recede. When
feeling recedes it makes craving recede. When craving recedes it makes
grasping recede. When grasping recedes it makes continued existence
recede. When continued existence recedes it makes rebirth recede. When
rebirth recedes it makes old age and death recede."

### N 12.70 The Wanderer Susīma *Susimaparibbājakasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding
ground.

Now at that time the Buddha was honored, respected, revered, venerated,
and esteemed. And he received robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines
and supplies for the sick. And the mendicant Saṅgha was
also honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And they
received robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the
sick. But the wanderers who followed other religions were not honored,
respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And they didn't receive
robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.

Now at that time the wanderer Susīma was residing at
Rājagaha together with a large community of wanderers.

Then his community said to Susīma, "Reverend
Susīma, please lead the spiritual life with the ascetic
Gotama. Memorize that teaching and have us recite it with you. When
we've memorized it we'll recite it to the laity. In this way we too will
be honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And we'll
receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the
sick."

"Yes, reverends," replied Susīma. Then he went to Venerable
Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite
conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Ānanda,
"Reverend Ānanda, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and
training."

Then Ānanda took Susīma to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to
one side, and said to him, "Sir, this wanderer Susīma says
that he wishes to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and
training."

"Well then, Ānanda, give Susīma the going forth." And the
wanderer Susīma received the going forth, the ordination in
the Buddha's presence.

Now at that time several mendicants had declared their enlightenment in
the Buddha's presence: "We understand: 'Rebirth is ended, the spiritual
journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is
nothing further for this place.'"

Venerable Susīma heard about this. He went up to those
mendicants, and exchanged greetings with them. When the greetings and
polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to those
mendicants, "Is it really true that the venerables have declared
enlightenment in the Buddha's presence?"

"Yes, reverend."

"But knowing and seeing thus, do you wield the many kinds of psychic
power? That is, multiplying yourselves and becoming one again; appearing
and disappearing; going unobstructed through a wall, a rampart, or a
mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it
were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged
through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun
and moon, so mighty and powerful. Do you control the body as far as the
realm of divinity?"

"No, reverend."

"Well, knowing and seeing thus do you, with clairaudience that is
purified and superhuman, hear both kinds of sounds, human and heavenly,
whether near or far?"

"No, reverend."

"Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you understand the minds of other
beings and individuals, having comprehended them with your mind? Do you
understand mind with greed as 'mind with greed', and mind without greed
as 'mind without greed'? Do you understand mind with hate as 'mind with
hate', and mind without hate as 'mind without hate'? Do you understand
mind with delusion as 'mind with delusion', and mind without delusion as
'mind without delusion'? Do you understand constricted mind as
'constricted mind', and scattered mind as 'scattered mind'? Do you
understand expansive mind as 'expansive mind', and unexpansive mind as
'unexpansive mind'? Do you understand mind that is not supreme as 'mind
that is not supreme', and mind that is supreme as 'mind that is
supreme'? Do you understand mind immersed in samādhi as
'mind immersed in samādhi', and mind not immersed in
samādhi as 'mind not immersed in samādhi'? Do
you understand freed mind as 'freed mind', and unfreed mind as 'unfreed
mind'?"

"No, reverend."

"Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you recollect many kinds of past
lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty,
fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of
the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of
the world contracting and expanding? Do you remember: 'There, I was
named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food.
This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended.
When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There,
too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that
was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my
life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.' Do
you recollect your many kinds of past lives, with features and details?"

"No, reverend."

"Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you, with clairvoyance that is
purified and superhuman, see sentient beings passing away and being
reborn---inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a
bad place---and understand how sentient beings are reborn according to
their deeds? 'These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech,
and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they
chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after
death, they're reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld,
hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body,
speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right
view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body
breaks up, after death, they're reborn in a good place, a heavenly
realm.' And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, do
you see sentient beings passing away and being reborn---inferior and
superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. And do you
understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds?"

"No, reverend."

"Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you have direct meditative experience
of the peaceful liberations that are formless, transcending form?"

"No, reverend."

"Well now, venerables, how could there be such a declaration when these
things are not attained?"

"Reverend Susīma, we are freed by wisdom."

"I don't understand the detailed meaning of what you have said in brief.
Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning."

"Reverend Susīma, whether you understand or not, we are
freed by wisdom."

Then Susīma went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and informed the Buddha of all he had discussed with those
mendicants.

"Susīma, first comes knowledge of the stability of natural
principles. Afterwards there is knowledge of extinguishment."

"Sir, I don't understand the detailed meaning of what you have said in
brief. Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed
meaning."

"Susīma, whether you understand or not, first comes
knowledge of the stability of natural principles. Afterwards there is
knowledge of extinguishment.

What do you think, Susīma? Is form permanent or
impermanent?"

"Impermanent, sir."

"But if it's impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?"

"Suffering, sir."

"But if it's impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be
regarded thus: 'This is mine, I am this, this is my self'?"

"No, sir."

"Is feeling permanent or impermanent?"

"Impermanent, sir."

"But if it's impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?"

"Suffering, sir."

"But if it's impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be
regarded thus: 'This is mine, I am this, this is my self'?"

"No, sir."

"Is perception permanent or impermanent?"

"Impermanent, sir." ...

"Are choices permanent or impermanent?"

"Impermanent, sir."

"But if they're impermanent, are they suffering or happiness?"

"Suffering, sir."

"But if they're impermanent, suffering, and perishable, are they fit to
be regarded thus: 'This is mine, I am this, this is my self'?"

"No, sir."

"Is consciousness permanent or impermanent?"

"Impermanent, sir."

"But if it's impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?"

"Suffering, sir."

"But if it's impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be
regarded thus: 'This is mine, I am this, this is my self'?"

"No, sir."

"So, Susīma, you should truly see any kind of form at
all---past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle;
inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form---with right
understanding: 'This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.'
You should truly see any kind of feeling at all---past, future, or
present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior;
far or near: *all* feeling---with right understanding: 'This is not
mine, I am not this, this is not my self.' You should truly see any kind
of perception at all---past, future, or present; internal or external;
solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: *all*
perception---with right understanding: 'This is not mine, I am not this,
this is not my self.' You should truly see any kind of choices at
all---past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle;
inferior or superior; far or near: *all* choices---with right
understanding: 'This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.'
You should truly see any kind of consciousness at all---past, future, or
present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior;
far or near: *all* consciousness---with right understanding: 'This is
not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.'

Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form,
feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. Being disillusioned,
desire fades away. When desire fades away they're freed. When they're
freed, they know they're freed.

They understand: 'Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been
completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further
for this place.'

Susīma, do you see that rebirth is a condition for old age
and death?"

"Yes, sir."

"Do you see that continued existence is a condition for rebirth?"

"Yes, sir."

"Do you see that grasping is a condition for continued existence?"

"Yes, sir."

"Do you see that craving is a condition for grasping?"

"Yes, sir."

"Do you see that feeling is a condition for craving ... contact is a
condition for feeling ... the six sense fields are conditions for
contact ... name and form are conditions for the six sense fields ...
consciousness is a condition for name and form ... choices are a
condition for consciousness ... ignorance is a condition for choices?"

"Yes, sir."

"Do you see that when rebirth ceases old age and death cease?"

"Yes, sir."

"Do you see that when continued existence ceases rebirth ceases?"

"Yes, sir."

"Do you see that when grasping ceases continued existence ceases ...
when craving ceases, grasping ceases ... when feeling ceases, craving
ceases ... when contact ceases, feeling ceases ... when the six sense
fields cease, contact ceases ... when name and form cease, the six sense
fields cease ... when consciousness ceases name and form cease ... when
choices cease consciousness ceases ... when ignorance ceases choices
cease?"

"Yes, sir."

"But knowing and seeing thus, do you wield the many kinds of psychic
power? ..."

"No, sir."

"Well, knowing and seeing thus do you, with clairaudience that is
purified and superhuman, hear both kinds of sounds, human and heavenly,
whether near or far?"

"No, sir."

"Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you understand the minds of other
beings and individuals, having comprehended them with your mind? ..."

"No, sir."

"Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you recollect many kinds of past
lives, with features and details?"

"No, sir."

"Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you, with clairvoyance that is
purified and superhuman, see sentient beings passing away and being
reborn ... according to their deeds?"

"No, sir."

"Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you have direct meditative experience
of the peaceful liberations that are formless, transcending form?"

"No, sir."

"Well now, Susīma, how could there be such a declaration
when these things are not attained?"

Then Venerable Susīma bowed with his head at the Buddha's
feet and said, "I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and
unskillful of me to go forth as a thief in such a well-explained
teaching and training. Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so
I will restrain myself in future."

"Indeed, Susīma, you made a mistake. It was foolish,
stupid, and unskillful of you to go forth as a thief in such a
well-explained teaching and training. Suppose they were to arrest a
bandit, a criminal and present him to the king, saying: 'Your Majesty,
this is a bandit, a criminal. Punish him as you will.' The king would
say: 'Go, my men, and tie this man's arms tightly behind his back with a
strong rope. Shave his head and march him from street to street and from
square to square to the beating of a harsh drum. Then take him out the
south gate and there, to the south of the city, chop off his head.' The
king's men would do as they were told. What do you think,
Susīma? Wouldn't that man experience pain and distress
because of that?"

"Yes, sir."

"Although that man would experience pain and distress because of that,
going forth as a thief in such a well-explained teaching and training
has a more painful and bitter result. And it even leads to the
underworld. But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is,
and have dealt with it properly, I accept it. For it is growth in the
training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal
with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future."

## The Chapter on Ascetics and Brahmins

### N 12.71 Old Age and Death *Jarāmaraṇasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery.

"Mendicants, there are ascetics and brahmins who don't understand old
age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that
leads to their cessation. I don't deem them as true ascetics and
brahmins. Those venerables don't realize the goal of life as an ascetic
or brahmin, and don't live having realized it with their own insight.

There are ascetics and brahmins who do understand old age and death,
their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their
cessation. I deem them as true ascetics and brahmins. Those venerables
realize the goal of life as an ascetic or brahmin, and live having
realized it with their own insight."

"Mendicants, one who does not truly know or see old age and death should
seek the Teacher so as to truly know old age and death. One who does not
truly know or see the origin of old age and death should seek the
Teacher so as to truly know the origin of old age and death. One who
does not truly know or see the cessation of old age and death should
seek the Teacher so as to truly know the cessation of old age and death.
One who does not truly know or see the practice that leads to the
cessation of old age and death should seek the Teacher so as to truly
know the practice that leads to the cessation of old age and death."
