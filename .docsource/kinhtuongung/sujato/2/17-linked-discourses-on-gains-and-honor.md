# Linked Discourses on Gains and Honor

## Chapter One

### N 17.1 Brutal *Dāruṇasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Possessions, honor, and popularity are brutal, bitter, and harsh.
They're an obstacle to reaching the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.

So you should train like this: 'We will give up arisen possessions,
honor, and popularity, and we won't let them occupy our minds.' That's
how you should train."

### N 17.2 A Hook *Baḷisasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Possessions, honor, and popularity are brutal, bitter, and harsh.
They're an obstacle to reaching the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.

Suppose a fisherman was to cast a baited hook into a deep lake. Seeing
the bait, a fish would swallow it. And so the fish that swallowed the
hook would meet with tragedy and disaster, and the fisherman can do what
he wants with it.

'Fisherman' is a term for Māra the Wicked. 'Hook' is a term
for possessions, honor, and popularity. Whoever enjoys and likes arisen
possessions, honor, and popularity is called a mendicant who has
swallowed Māra's hook. They've met with tragedy and
disaster, and the Wicked One can do with them what he wants.

So brutal are possessions, honor, and popularity---bitter and harsh, an
obstacle to reaching the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.

So you should train like this: 'We will give up arisen possessions,
honor, and popularity, and we won't let them occupy our minds.' That's
how you should train."

### N 17.3 A Turtle *Kummasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Possessions, honor, and popularity are brutal ...

Once upon a time in a certain lake there was a large family of turtles
that had lived there for a long time. Then one of the turtles said to
another, 'My dear turtle, don't you go to that place.'

But that turtle did go to that place, and a hunter pierced her with a
harpoon.

Then that turtle went back to the other turtle. When the other turtle
saw her coming off in the distance, he said, 'My dear turtle, I hope you
didn't go to that place!'

'I did.'

'But my dear turtle, I hope you're not hurt or injured!'

'I'm not hurt or injured. But this cord keeps dragging behind me.'

'Indeed, my dear turtle, you're hurt and injured! Your father and
grandfather met with tragedy and disaster because of such a cord. Go
now, you are no longer one of us.'

'Hunter' is a term for Māra the Wicked.

'Harpoon' is a term for possessions, honor, and popularity.

'Cord' is a term for greed and relishing.

Whoever enjoys and likes arisen possessions, honor, and popularity is
called a mendicant who has been pierced with a harpoon. They've met with
tragedy and disaster, and the Wicked One can do with them what he wants.

So brutal are possessions, honor, and popularity. ..."

### N 17.4 A Fleecy Sheep *Dīghalomikasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Possessions, honor, and popularity are brutal ...

Suppose a fleecy sheep was to enter a briar patch. She'd get caught,
snagged, and trapped at every turn, coming to ruin.

In the same way, take a certain mendicant whose mind is overcome and
overwhelmed by possessions, honor, and popularity. They robe up in the
morning and, taking their bowl and robe, enter the village or town for
alms. They get caught, snagged, and trapped at every turn, coming to
ruin.

So brutal are possessions, honor, and popularity. ..."

### N 17.5 A Dung Beetle *Mīḷhakasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Possessions, honor, and popularity are brutal ...

Suppose there was a dung-eating beetle full of dung, stuffed with dung,
and before her was a huge pile of dung. She'd look down on other
beetles, thinking: 'For I am a dung-eating beetle full of dung, stuffed
with dung, and before me is a huge pile of dung.'

In the same way, take a certain mendicant whose mind is overcome and
overwhelmed by possessions, honor, and popularity. They robe up in the
morning and, taking their bowl and robe, enter the village or town for
alms. There they eat as much as they like, get invited back tomorrow,
and have plenty of almsfood. When they get back to the monastery, they
boast in the middle of a group of mendicants: 'I ate as much as I liked,
got invited back tomorrow, and had plenty of almsfood. I get robes,
almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. But these
other mendicants have little merit or significance, so they don't get
these things.' With a mind overcome and overwhelmed by possessions,
honor, and popularity, they look down on other good-hearted mendicants.
This will be for their lasting harm and suffering.

So brutal are possessions, honor, and popularity. ..."

### N 17.6 A Bolt of Lightning *Asanisutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Possessions, honor, and popularity are brutal ...

Who should be struck by lightning? A trainee who comes into possessions,
honor, and popularity before they achieve their heart's desire.

'Lightning strike' is a term for possessions, honor, and popularity.

So brutal are possessions, honor, and popularity. ..."

### N 17.7 A Poisoned Arrow *Diddhasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Possessions, honor, and popularity are brutal ...

Who should be pierced by a poisoned arrow? A trainee who comes into
possessions, honor, and popularity before they achieve their heart's
desire.

'Arrow' is a term for possessions, honor, and popularity.

So brutal are possessions, honor, and popularity. ..."

### N 17.8 A Jackal *Siṅgālasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Possessions, honor, and popularity are brutal ...

Mendicants, did you hear an old jackal howling at the crack of dawn?"

"Yes, sir."

"That old jackal has the disease called mange. He's not happy in his
den, or at the root of a tree, or out in the open. Wherever he goes,
stands, sits, or lies down he meets with tragedy and disaster.

In the same way, take a certain mendicant whose mind is overcome and
overwhelmed by possessions, honor, and popularity. They're not happy in
an empty hut, at the root of a tree, or out in the open. Wherever they
go, stand, sit, or lie down they meet with tragedy and disaster.

So brutal are possessions, honor, and popularity. ..."

### N 17.9 Gale-force Winds *Verambhasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Possessions, honor, and popularity are brutal ...

High in the atmosphere there are gale-force winds blowing. Any bird that
flies there is flung about by those gale-force winds. Their feet go one
way, their wings another, their head another, and their body another.

In the same way, take a certain monk whose mind is overcome and
overwhelmed by possessions, honor, and popularity. He robes up in the
morning and, taking his bowl and robe, enters the village or town for
alms without guarding body, speech, and mind, without establishing
mindfulness, and without restraining the sense faculties. There he sees
a female scantily clad, with revealing clothes. Lust infects his mind.
He rejects the training and returns to a lesser life. Some take his
robe, others his bowl, others his sitting cloth, others his needle case,
just like the bird flung about by the gale-force winds.

So brutal are possessions, honor, and popularity. ..."

### N 17.10 With Verses *Sagāthakasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Possessions, honor, and popularity are brutal ...

Take a case where I see a certain person whose mind is overcome and
overwhelmed by honor. When their body breaks up, after death, they're
reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.

Take another case where I see a certain person whose mind is overcome
and overwhelmed by lack of honor. When their body breaks up, after
death, they're reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld,
hell.

And take another case where I see a certain person whose mind is
overcome and overwhelmed by both honor and lack of honor. When their
body breaks up, after death, they're reborn in a place of loss, a bad
place, the underworld, hell.

So brutal are possessions, honor, and popularity. ..."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "Whether they're honored\
> or not honored, or both,\
> their immersion doesn't waver\
> as they live diligently.
>
> They persistently meditate\
> with subtle view and discernment.\
> Rejoicing in the ending of grasping,\
> they're said to be a true person."

## Chapter Two

### N 17.11 A Gold Cup *Suvaṇṇapātisutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Possessions, honor, and popularity are brutal ...

When I've comprehended the mind of a certain person, I understand: 'This
venerable would not tell a deliberate lie even for the sake of a gold
cup filled with silver powder.' But some time later I see them tell a
deliberate lie because their mind is overcome and overwhelmed by
possessions, honor, and popularity.

So brutal are possessions, honor, and popularity. ..."

### N 17.12 A Silver Pot *Rūpiyapātisutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Possessions, honor, and popularity are brutal ...

When I've comprehended the mind of a certain person, I understand: 'This

deliberate lie because their mind is overcome and overwhelmed by
possessions, honor, and popularity.

So brutal are possessions, honor, and popularity. ..."

### N 17.13--20 A Gold Ingot, Etc. *Suvaṇṇanikkhasuttādiaṭṭhaka*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, when I've comprehended the mind of a certain person, I
understand: 'This venerable would not tell a deliberate lie even for the
sake of a gold ingot.' ..."

"'... for the sake of a hundred gold ingots.' ..."

"'... for the sake of a mountain of gold.' ..."

"'... for the sake of a hundred mountains of gold.' ..."

"'... for the sake of the whole earth full of gold.' ..."

"'... for any kind of material reward.' ..."

"'... for the sake of life.' ..."

"'... for the sake of the finest lady in the land.' But some time later
I see them tell a deliberate lie because their mind is overcome and
overwhelmed by possessions, honor, and popularity.

So brutal are possessions, honor, and popularity. ..."

## Chapter Three

### N 17.21 A Female *Mātugāmasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Even if you're alone with a female she might not occupy your mind, but

So brutal are possessions, honor, and popularity. ..."

### N 17.23 An Only Son *Ekaputtakasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Possessions, honor, and popularity are brutal ...

A faithful laywoman with a dear and beloved only son would rightly
appeal to him, 'My darling, please be like the householder Citta and
Hatthaka of Āḷavī.'

These are a standard and a measure for my male lay disciples, that is,
the householder Citta and Hatthaka of Āḷavī.

'But my darling, if you go forth from the lay life to homelessness,
please be like Sāriputta and Moggallāna.'

These are a standard and a measure for my monk disciples, that is,
Sāriputta and Moggallāna.

'And my darling, may you not come into possessions, honor, and
popularity while you're still a trainee and haven't achieved your
heart's desire.'

If a trainee who hasn't achieved their heart's desire comes into
possessions, honor, and popularity it's an obstacle for them.

So brutal are possessions, honor, and popularity. ..."

### N 17.24 An Only Daughter *Ekadhītusutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Possessions, honor, and popularity are brutal ...

A faithful laywoman with a dear and beloved only daughter would rightly
appeal to her, 'My darling, please be like the laywomen
Khujjuttarā and Veḷukaṇṭakī, Nanda's mother.'

These are a standard and a measure for my female lay disciples, that is,
the laywomen Khujjuttarā and Veḷukaṇṭakī,
Nanda's mother.

please be like the nuns Khemā and

nuns Khemā and Uppalavaṇṇā.

'And my darling, may you not come into possessions, honor, and

heart's desire.' If a trainee who hasn't achieved their heart's desire
comes into possessions, honor, and popularity it's an obstacle for them.

So brutal are possessions, honor, and popularity. ..."

### N 17.25 Ascetics and Brahmins *Samaṇabrāhmaṇasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, there are ascetics and brahmins who don't truly understand
the gratification, drawback, and escape when it comes to possessions,
honor, and popularity. I don't deem them as true ascetics and brahmins.
Those venerables don't realize the goal of life as an ascetic or
brahmin, and don't live having realized it with their own insight.

There are ascetics and brahmins who do truly understand the
gratification, drawback, and escape when it comes to possessions, honor,
and popularity. I deem them as true ascetics and brahmins. Those
venerables realize the goal of life as an ascetic or brahmin, and live
having realized it with their own insight."

### N 17.26 Ascetics and Brahmins (2nd) *Dutiyasamaṇabrāhmaṇasutta*

bones, until they reach the marrow and keep pushing.

So brutal are possessions, honor, and popularity. ..."

### N 17.29 A Rope *Rajjusutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Possessions, honor, and popularity are brutal ...

They cut through the outer skin, the inner skin, the flesh, sinews, and
bones, until they reach the marrow and keep pushing.

Suppose a strong man was to twist a tough horse-hair rope around your
shin and tighten it. It would cut through the outer skin, the inner
skin, the flesh, sinews, and bones, until it reached the marrow and kept
pushing.

In the same way, possessions, honor, and popularity cut through the
outer skin, the inner skin, the flesh, sinews, and bones, until they
reach the marrow and keep pushing.

So brutal are possessions, honor, and popularity. ..."

### N 17.30 A Mendicant With Defilements Ended *Bhikkhusutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, possessions, honor, and popularity are an obstacle even for
a mendicant who is perfected, with defilements ended."

When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, "Sir, what do
possessions, honor, and popularity obstruct for a mendicant with
defilements ended?"

"Ānanda, I don't say that possessions, honor, and popularity obstruct
the unshakable freedom of heart. But I do say that possessions, honor,
and popularity obstruct the achievement of blissful meditations in this
life for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.

So brutal are possessions, honor, and popularity---bitter and harsh, an
obstacle to reaching the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.

So you should train like this: 'We will give up arisen possessions,
honor, and popularity, and we won't let them occupy our minds.' That's
how you should train."

## Chapter Four

### N 17.35 Shortly After He Left *Acirapakkantasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the
Vulture's Peak Mountain, not long after Devadatta had left. There the
Buddha spoke to the mendicants about Devadatta:

"Possessions, honor, and popularity came to Devadatta for his own ruin
and downfall.

It's like a banana tree ... or a bamboo ... or a reed, all of which bear
fruit to their own ruin and downfall ...

It's like a mule, which becomes pregnant to its own ruin and downfall.
In the same way, possessions, honor, and popularity came to Devadatta
for his own ruin and downfall.

So brutal are possessions, honor, and popularity. That's how you should
train."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "The banana tree is destroyed by its own fruit,\
> as are the bamboo and the reed.\
> Honor destroys a sinner,\
> as pregnancy destroys a mule."

### N 17.36 Five Hundred Carts *Pañcarathasatasutta*

Near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding
ground.

Now at that time Prince Ajātasattu was going with five
hundred carts in the morning and the evening to attend on Devadatta,
presenting him with an offering of five hundred servings of food.

Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to him, "Sir, Prince Ajātasattu is going
with five hundred carts in the morning and the evening to attend on
Devadatta, presenting him with an offering of five hundred servings of
food."

"Mendicants, don't envy Devadatta's possessions, honor, and popularity.
As long as Prince Ajātasattu goes with five hundred carts
in the morning and the evening to attend on Devadatta, presenting him
with an offering of five hundred servings of food, Devadatta can expect
decline, not growth, in skillful qualities.

If they were to pop a boil on a wild dog's nose, it would get even
wilder. In the same way, as long as Prince Ajātasattu goes
with five hundred carts in the morning and the evening to attend on
Devadatta, presenting him with an offering of five hundred servings of
food, Devadatta can expect decline, not growth, in skillful qualities.

So brutal are possessions, honor, and popularity. ..."

### N 17.37 Mother *Mātusutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Possessions, honor, and popularity are brutal, bitter, and harsh.
They're an obstacle to reaching the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.
When I've comprehended the mind of a certain person, I understand: 'This
venerable would not tell a deliberate lie even for the sake of their
mother.' But some time later I see them tell a deliberate lie because
their mind is overcome and overwhelmed by possessions, honor, and
popularity.

So brutal are possessions, honor, and popularity---bitter and harsh, an
obstacle to reaching the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.

So you should train like this: 'We will give up arisen possessions,
honor, and popularity, and we won't let them occupy our minds.' That's
how you should train."

### N 17.38--43 Father, Etc. *Pitusuttādichakka*

At Sāvatthī.

They're an obstacle to reaching the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.
When I've comprehended the mind of a certain person, I understand: 'This
venerable would not tell a deliberate lie even for the sake of their
father.' ..."

**(Tell in full as in SN 17.37.)**

"'... brother.' ..."

"'... sister.' ..."

"'... son.' ..."

"'... daughter.' ..."

"'... wife.' But some time later I see them tell a deliberate lie
because their mind is overcome and overwhelmed by possessions, honor,
and popularity.

So brutal are possessions, honor, and popularity---bitter and harsh, an
obstacle to reaching the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.

So you should train like this: 'We will give up arisen possessions,
honor, and popularity, and we won't let them occupy our minds.' That's
how you should train."
