# Linked Discourses on the Unknowable Beginning

## Chapter One

### N 15.1 Grass and Sticks *Tiṇakaṭṭhasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, transmigration has no known beginning. No first point is
found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, shrouded by
ignorance and fettered by craving. Suppose a person was to strip all the
grass, sticks, branches, and leaves in the Black Plum Tree Land, gather
them together into one pile, and chop them each into four inch pieces.
They'd lay them down, saying: 'This is my mother, this is my
grandmother.' The grass, sticks, branches, and leaves of the Black Plum
Tree Land would run out before that person's mothers and grandmothers.

Why is that? Transmigration has no known beginning. No first point is
found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, shrouded by
ignorance and fettered by craving. For such a long time you have
undergone suffering, agony, and disaster, swelling the cemeteries. This
is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and
freed regarding all conditions."

### N 15.2 The Earth *Pathavīsutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, transmigration has no known beginning. No first point is
found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, shrouded by
ignorance and fettered by craving. Suppose a person was to make the
whole earth into clay balls the size of jujube seeds. They'd lay them
down, saying: 'This is my father, this is my grandfather.' The whole
earth would run out before that person's fathers and grandfathers.

Why is that? Transmigration has no known beginning. No first point is
found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, shrouded by
ignorance and fettered by craving. For such a long time you have
undergone suffering, agony, and disaster, swelling the cemeteries. This
is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and
freed regarding all conditions."

### N 15.3 Tears *Assusutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, transmigration has no known beginning. No first point is
found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, shrouded by
ignorance and fettered by craving. What do you think? Which is more: the
flow of tears you've shed while roaming and transmigrating for such a
very long time---weeping and wailing from being united with the unloved
and separated from the loved---or the water in the four oceans?"

"As we understand the Buddha's teaching, the flow of tears we've shed
while roaming and transmigrating is more than the water in the four
oceans."

"Good, good, mendicants! It's good that you understand my teaching like
this. The flow of tears you've shed while roaming and transmigrating is
indeed more than the water in the four oceans. For a long time you've
undergone the death of a mother ... father ... brother ... sister ...
son ... daughter ... loss of relatives ... loss of wealth ... or loss
through illness. From being united with the unloved and separated from
the loved, the flow of tears you've shed while roaming and
transmigrating is indeed more than the water in the four oceans.

Why is that? Transmigration has no known beginning. ... This is quite
enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed
regarding all conditions."

### N 15.4 Mother's Milk *Khīrasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, transmigration has no known beginning. No first point is
found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, shrouded by
ignorance and fettered by craving.

What do you think? Which is more: the mother's milk you've drunk while
roaming and transmigrating for such a very long time, or the water in
the four oceans?"

"As we understand the Buddha's teaching, the mother's milk we've drunk
while roaming and transmigrating is more than the water in the four
oceans."

"Good, good, mendicants! It's good that you understand my teaching like
this. The mother's milk you've drunk while roaming and transmigrating
for such a very long time is more than the water in the four oceans.

Why is that? Transmigration has no known beginning. ... This is quite
enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed
regarding all conditions."

### N 15.5 A Mountain *Pabbatasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and
asked him, "Sir, how long is an eon?"

"Mendicant, an eon is long. It's not easy to calculate how many years,
how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it
lasts."

"But sir, is it possible to give a simile?"

"It's possible," said the Buddha.

"Suppose there was a huge stone mountain, a league long, a league wide,
and a league high, with no cracks or holes, one solid mass. And as each
century passed someone would stroke it once with a fine cloth from
Kāsi. By this means the huge stone mountain would be worn
away before the eon comes to an end. That's how long an eon is. And
we've transmigrated through many such eons, many hundreds, many
thousands, many hundreds of thousands.

Why is that? Transmigration has no known beginning. ... This is quite
enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed
regarding all conditions."

### N 15.6 A Mustard Seed *Sāsapasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha ... and asked him, "Sir, how long
is an eon?"

"Mendicant, an eon is long. It's not easy to calculate how many years,
how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it
lasts."

"But sir, is it possible to give a simile?"

"It's possible," said the Buddha.

"Suppose there was an iron city, a league long, a league wide, and a
league high, full of mustard seeds pressed into balls. And as each
century passed someone would remove a single mustard seed. By this means
the huge heap of mustard seeds would be used up before the eon comes to
an end. That's how long an eon is. And we've transmigrated through many
such eons, many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands.

Why is that? Transmigration has no known beginning. ... This is quite
enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed
regarding all conditions."

### N 15.7 Disciples *Sāvakasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha ... and asked him, "Sir,
how many eons have passed?"

"Mendicants, many eons have passed. It's not easy to calculate how many
eons have passed, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of
thousands of eons."

"But sir, is it possible to give a simile?"

"It's possible," said the Buddha.

"Suppose there were four disciples with a lifespan of a hundred years.
And each day they would each recollect a hundred thousand eons. Those
four disciples would pass away after a hundred years and there would
still be eons that they haven't recollected. That's how many eons have
passed. It's not easy to calculate how many eons have passed, how many
hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of eons.

Why is that? Transmigration has no known beginning. ... This is quite
enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed
regarding all conditions."

### N 15.8 The Ganges *Gaṅgāsutta*

Near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove. Then a certain brahmin
went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.

When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one
side and asked the Buddha, "Worthy Gotama, how many eons have passed?"

"Brahmin, many eons have passed. It's not easy to calculate how many
eons have passed, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of
thousands of eons."

"But worthy Gotama, can you give a simile?"

"I can," said the Buddha.

"Consider the Ganges river from where it originates to where it meets
the ocean. Between these places it's not easy to calculate how many
grains of sand there are, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of
thousands of grains of sand. The eons that have passed are more than
this. It's not easy to calculate how many eons have passed, how many
hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of eons.

Why is that? Transmigration has no known beginning. No first point is
found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, shrouded by
ignorance and fettered by craving. For such a long time you have
undergone suffering, agony, and disaster, swelling the cemeteries. This
is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and
freed regarding all conditions."

When he said this, the brahmin said to the Buddha, "Excellent, worthy
Gotama! Excellent! ... From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama
remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."

### N 15.9 A Stick *Daṇḍasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, transmigration has no known beginning. No first point is
found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, shrouded by
ignorance and fettered by craving. Suppose a stick was tossed up in the
air. Sometimes it'd fall on its bottom, sometimes the middle, and
sometimes the end. It's the same for sentient beings roaming and
transmigrating, shrouded by ignorance and fettered by craving. Sometimes
they go from this world to the other world, and sometimes they come from
the other world to this world.

Why is that? Transmigration has no known beginning. ... This is quite
enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed
regarding all conditions."

### N 15.10 A Single Person *Puggalasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the
Vulture's Peak Mountain. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
"Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, transmigration has no known beginning. ... One person
roaming and transmigrating for an eon would amass a heap of bones the
size of this Mount Vepulla, if they were gathered together and not lost.

Why is that? Transmigration has no known beginning. ... This is quite
enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed
regarding all conditions."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "If the bones of a single person\
> for a single eon were gathered up,\
> they'd make a pile the size of a mountain:\
> so said the great seer.
>
> And this is declared to be\
> as huge as Mount Vepulla,\
> higher than the Vulture's Peak\
> in the Magadhan mountain range.
>
> But then, with right understanding,\
> a person sees the noble truths---\
> suffering, suffering's origin,\
> suffering's transcendence,\
> and the noble eightfold path\
> that leads to the stilling of suffering.
>
> After roaming on seven times at most,\
> that person\
> makes an end of suffering,\
> with the ending of all fetters."

## Chapter Two

### N 15.11 In a Sorry State *Duggatasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, transmigration has no known beginning. No first point is
found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, shrouded by
ignorance and fettered by craving. When you see someone in a sorry
state, in distress, you should conclude: 'In all this long time, we too
have undergone the same thing.' Why is that? Transmigration has no known
beginning. ... This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned,
dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions."

### N 15.12 In a Good Way *Sukhitasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, transmigration has no known beginning. ... When you see
someone in a good way, in a happy state, you should conclude: 'In all
this long time, we too have undergone the same thing.'

Why is that? Transmigration has no known beginning. ... This is quite
enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed
regarding all conditions."

### N 15.13 Thirty Mendicants *Tiṁsamattasutta*

Near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove. Then thirty mendicants
from Pāvā went to the Buddha. All of them lived in the
wilderness, ate only almsfood, wore rag robes, and owned just three
robes; yet they all still had fetters. They bowed to the Buddha and sat
down to one side.

Then it occurred to the Buddha, "These thirty mendicants from
Pāvā live in the wilderness, eat only almsfood, wear rag
robes, and own just three robes; yet they all still have fetters. Why
don't I teach them the Dhamma in such a way that their minds are freed
from defilements by not grasping while sitting in this very seat?"

Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, transmigration has no known beginning. No first point is
found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, shrouded by
ignorance and fettered by craving.

What do you think? Which is more: the flow of blood you've shed when
your head was chopped off while roaming and transmigrating for such a
very long time, or the water in the four oceans?"

"As we understand the Buddha's teaching, the flow of blood we've shed
when our head was chopped off while roaming and transmigrating is more
than the water in the four oceans."

"Good, good, mendicants! It's good that you understand my teaching like
this. The flow of blood you've shed when your head was chopped off while
roaming and transmigrating is indeed more than the water in the four
oceans. For a long time you've been cows, and the flow of blood you've
shed when your head was chopped off as a cow is more than the water in
the four oceans. For a long time you've been buffalo ... rams ... goats
... deer ... chickens ... pigs ... For a long time you've been bandits,
arrested for raiding villages, highway robbery, or adultery. And the
flow of blood you've shed when your head was chopped off as a bandit is
more than the water in the four oceans.

Why is that? Transmigration has no known beginning. ... This is quite
enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed
regarding all conditions."

That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants approved what
the Buddha said. And while this discourse was being spoken, the minds of
the thirty mendicants from Pāvā were freed from defilements
by not grasping.

### N 15.14 Mother *Mātusutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, transmigration has no known beginning. ... It's not easy to
find a sentient being who in all this long time has not previously been
your mother.

Why is that? Transmigration has no known beginning. ... This is quite
enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed
regarding all conditions."

### N 15.15 Father *Pitusutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, transmigration has no known beginning. ... It's not easy to
find a sentient being who in all this long time has not previously been
your father. ... This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned,
dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions."

### N 15.16 Brother *Bhātusutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"It's not easy to find a sentient being who in all this long time has
not previously been your brother. ... This is quite enough for you to
become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all
conditions."

### N 15.17 Sister *Bhaginisutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"It's not easy to find a sentient being who in all this long time has
not previously been your sister. ... This is quite enough for you to
become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all
conditions."

### N 15.18 Son *Puttasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"It's not easy to find a sentient being who in all this long time has
not previously been your son. ... This is quite enough for you to become
disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions."

### N 15.19 Daughter *Dhītusutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, transmigration has no known beginning. No first point is
found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, shrouded by
ignorance and fettered by craving. It's not easy to find a sentient
being who in all this long time has not previously been your daughter.

Why is that? Transmigration has no known beginning. No first point is
found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, shrouded by
ignorance and fettered by craving. For such a long time you have
undergone suffering, agony, and disaster, swelling the cemeteries. This
is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and
freed regarding all conditions."

### N 15.20 Mount Vepulla *Vepullapabbatasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the
Vulture's Peak Mountain. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
"Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, transmigration has no known beginning. No first point is
found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, shrouded by
ignorance and fettered by craving. Once upon a time, mendicants, this
Mount Vepulla was known as Pācīnavaṁsa. And at that time
people were known as Tivaras. The lifespan of the Tivaras was 40,000
years. It took them four days to climb Mount Vepulla, and four days to
descend. At that time Kakusandha, the Blessed One, the perfected one,
the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world. Kakusandha had a fine pair
of chief disciples named Vidhura and Sañjīva. See,
mendicants! This mountain's name has vanished, those people have passed
away, and that Buddha has become fully quenched. So impermanent are
conditions, so unstable are conditions, so unreliable are conditions.
This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and
freed regarding all conditions.

Once upon a time this Mount Vepulla was known as Vaṅkaka.
And at that time people were known as Rohitassas. The lifespan of the
Rohitassas was 30,000 years. It took them three days to climb Mount
Vepulla, and three days to descend. At that time
Koṇāgamana, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully
awakened Buddha arose in the world. Koṇāgamana had a fine
pair of chief disciples named Bhiyyosa and Uttara. See, mendicants! This
mountain's name has vanished, those people have passed away, and that
Buddha has become fully quenched. So impermanent are conditions ...

Once upon a time this Mount Vepulla was known as Supassa. And at that
time people were known as Suppiyas. The lifespan of the Suppiyas was
20,000 years. It took them two days to climb Mount Vepulla, and two days
to descend. At that time Kassapa, the Blessed One, the perfected one,
the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world. Kassapa had a fine pair of
chief disciples named Tissa and Bhāradvāja. See,
mendicants! This mountain's name has vanished, those people have passed
away, and that Buddha has become fully quenched. So impermanent are
conditions ...

These days this Mount Vepulla is known as Vepulla. And these people are
known as Magadhans. The lifespan of the Magadhans is short, brief, and
fleeting. A long life is a hundred years or a little more. It takes the
Magadhans an hour to climb Mount Vepulla, and an hour to descend. And
now I am the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha
who has arisen in the world. I have a fine pair of chief disciples named
Sāriputta and Moggallāna. There will come a
time when this mountain's name will vanish, those people will die, and I
will be fully extinguished. So impermanent are conditions, so unstable
are conditions, so unreliable are conditions. This is quite enough for
you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all
conditions."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "For the Tivaras it was Pācīnavaṁsa,\
> for the Rohitassas, Vaṅkaka,\
> Supassa for the Suppiyas,\
> and Vepulla for the Magadhans.
>
> Oh! Conditions are impermanent,\
> their nature is to rise and fall;\
> having arisen, they cease;\
> their stilling is blissful."
