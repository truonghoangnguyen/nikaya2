# Linked Discourses with Rāhula

## Chapter One

### N 18.1 The Eye, Etc. *Cakkhusutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery.

Then Venerable Rāhula went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat
down to one side, and said to him, "Sir, may the Buddha please teach me
Dhamma in brief. When I've heard it, I'll live alone, withdrawn,
diligent, keen, and resolute."

"What do you think, Rāhula? Is the eye permanent or
impermanent?"

"Impermanent, sir."

"But if it's impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?"

"Suffering, sir."

"But if it's impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be
regarded thus: 'This is mine, I am this, this is my self'?"

"No, sir."

"Is the ear permanent or impermanent?"

"Impermanent, sir." ...

"Is the nose permanent or impermanent?"

"Impermanent, sir." ...

"Is the tongue permanent or impermanent?"

"Impermanent, sir." ...

"Is the body permanent or impermanent?"

"Impermanent, sir." ...

"Is the mind permanent or impermanent?"

"Impermanent, sir."

"But if it's impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?"

"Suffering, sir."

"But if it's impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be
regarded thus: 'This is mine, I am this, this is my self'?"

"No, sir."

"Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye,
the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body, and the mind. Being
disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they're freed.
When they're freed, they know they're freed.

They understand: 'Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been
completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further
for this place.'"

and all external stimuli?"

"Rāhula, one truly sees any kind of form at all---past,
future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or
superior; far or near: *all* form---with right understanding: 'This is
not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.' One truly sees any kind
of feeling ... perception ... choices ... consciousness at all---past,

stimuli; and going beyond discrimination, it's peaceful and well freed?"

"Rāhula, when one truly sees any kind of form at
all---past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle;
inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form---with right
understanding: 'This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self,'
one is freed by not grasping.

When one truly sees any kind of feeling ... perception ... choices ...
When one truly sees any kind of consciousness at all---past, future, or
present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior;

not mine, I am not this, this is not my self,' one is freed by not
grasping.
