## How the Saṁyutta is Organized

The Saṁyutta Nikāya is conveniently divided
into five large *vaggas* or "books". As noted in the General Guide, the
Saṁyutta is an example of the "nested *vagga*" structure,
where the (unusual) *vagga* as "book" includes many of the normal kind
of "small" *vagga*, i.e. groups of about ten suttas.

Within each of the five "big" *vaggas* there are several
*saṁyuttas*, each containing a set of discourses that are
linked by person or theme (sometimes both). For example, each of the
discourses in [SN 5](https://suttacentral.net/sn5) features a nun
(*bhikkhunī*), while each discourse in [SN
24](https://suttacentral.net/sn24) deals with the subject of "views"
(*diṭṭhi*).

In SuttaCentral, the discourses of the Saṁyutta are
referenced by *saṁyutta* and *sutta*. Thus [SN
1.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn1.1) is the first discourse of the first
*saṁyutta*, while [SN
56.11](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11) is the eleventh discourse of
the fifty-sixth *saṁyutta*. The SuttaCentral system is the
same as that used by Bhikkhu Bodhi in his *Connected Discourses of the
Buddha* and on Access to Insight.

The five books are named according to various principles:

- Vol. 1 Sagāthāvagga contains sets of discourses that
  contain verses, as indicated by the title.

- Vols. 2--4 are each named after the first and largest
 *saṁyutta* of the book.

- Vol. 5 is called the "Great Book" (*Mahāvagga*) due to
  its size. The Chinese version is called, appropriately, "The Book of
  the Path" (*Maggavagga*).

In this essay I will give an overview of each of the five books.
However, I will not summarize each of the 56 *saṁyuttas*,
for that would make it far too long. For such summaries, see the lists
of suttas on SuttaCentral, which include explanations of the various
structural levels of the *saṁyutta*, as well as individual
discourses. Here I will focus more on general questions of content and
interpretation.
