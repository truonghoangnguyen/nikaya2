## The Book of the Six Sense Fields

The "Book of the Six Sense Fields" is the fourth of the five books of
the Linked Discourses. It is named after the first and longest
*saṁyutta*. The second *saṁyutta* on Feelings
also deals with a major doctrinal topic, one that is closely related to
the main theme. The remaining eight *saṁyuttas* deal with
secondary themes organized by subject or by person.

The number of discourses in the "Linked Discourses on the Six Sense
Fields" varies between editions, mainly due to the way repetitions are
counted; SuttaCentral follows Bhikkhu Bodhi's translation in counting
248 discourses; see his introduction to this chapter for a discussion of
the problems in counting the Suttas of this collection. They are
collected in four *paṇṇasakas*.

This *saṁyutta* has an especially close relationship with
the "Linked Discourses on the Aggregates", one that goes far beyond the
apparent thematic similarities. Many of the discourses in the two
collections are constructed on virtually identical lines. Bhikkhu Bodhi
explores these connections with his notion of "template parallels",
which are found throughout the Saṁyutta
Nikāya, but especially with these two sections.

The six sense fields complement the five aggregates as the summary of
the noble truth of suffering. Where the aggregates focus on the
functional structure of experience as a basis for views of self, the
emphasis here is on how sense experience stimulates desire.

The six sense fields are the means through which the world is known, and
so each of them has two aspects. The "inner" aspect is the sense organs,
for example the "eye" or the "ear", which make it possible for an
organism to experience the outside world by receiving sense stimuli.
These are paired with the external sensory stimuli, such as "sights" or
"sounds", which impact the sense organ (contact, *phassa*) and give rise
to the appropriate form of consciousness.

It's best to avoid thinking of the external sense fields as "objects",
since in the suttas they are depicted in relation to the observing mind,
and not as independently existing entities. There is no word for
"object" in this sense in the early texts: existence is not objective,
it is relational. The term *ārammaṇa*, which came to be
used in this sense much later in the Abhidhamma, means "support" in the
suttas.

The operation of the senses is relatively straightforward until we come
to the last sense, the "mind" and "thoughts" or "mental phenomena". To
clear up possible confusion, this "sixth sense" is simply the mental
faculty and has nothing to do with psychic powers. And unlike the five
external senses, the "inner" sense field is not a physical organ: *mano*
does not mean "brain".

The exact meaning of "mind" (*mano*) in this context is not spelled out,
so let us consider this first. The suttas use three main terms for the
mind: *mano*, *citta*, and *viññāṇa*. In general, these are
synonyms and it is not possible to draw hard and fast distinctions
between them ([AN 3.60](https://suttacentral.net/an3.60), [DN
1:2](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#2), [SN
12.61](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.61)). Nevertheless, they tend to be
used in different contexts, each with a distinct nuance. These contexts
can be understood in terms of the four noble truths; thus the different
terms refer to the same thing but imply a different aspect or response
to that thing.

*Viññāṇa*

:   In doctrinal contexts this is awareness itself, the sheer knowing of
    things. It appears in this sense in dependent origination, the
    aggregates, and the sense fields. Hence it pertains to the first
    noble truth, the suffering of the world, and it needs to be fully
    understood. In colloquial usage, however, it can take on a variety
    of shades of meaning, such as "understanding".

*Mano*

:   The mind in action, one of the three spheres of *kamma*, a sense it
    inherits from the Upaniṣads. It is that which creates
    results, as in the famous first line of the Dhammapada: *mano
    pubbaṅgamā dhammā*, "mind is the
    forerunner of all things". It is particularly used in ethical
    contexts, the performance of mental acts that bear fruit of either
    good or bad. So it may be understood as primarily relating to the
    second and third noble truths, the origination and ending of
    suffering.

*Citta*

:   The most general, and the least tightly bound to a particular
    technical sense. It is used widely as "mind", "thought", "heart",
    etc. But when found in technical contexts it refers to
   *samādhi*, to the purified awareness of deep meditative
    immersion. For this reason, it is specially used in contexts
    relating to the path, the fourth noble truth.

In the six senses, *mano* is clearly not identical with the "knowing"
(*viññāṇa*), as it gives rise to it. Nor is it the "known",
the phenomena of which the mind is aware, for that is
*dhammā*. Nor is it the turning towards or paying attention
to the thing known, as is revealed in [MN
28](https://suttacentral.net/mn28) *The Longer Simile of the Elephant's
Footprint* (*Mahāhatthipadopamasutta*):

> Though the mind is intact internally, so long as exterior thoughts
> don't come into range and there's no corresponding attention, there's
> no manifestation of the corresponding type of consciousness.

This passage suggests that, like the physical sense organs, *mano* in
some way pre-exists the actual moment of conscious awareness. This does
not mean that it is some mystical substrata of consciousness, for as we
have seen *mano* is consistently used in the sense of the mind that
performs acts, especially those with a moral dimension. So the *mano* is
that which has performed deeds in the past, fueling an ongoing mental
continuum within which the results of those deeds may be experienced in
the present. It is the mental faculty that bears the potential for
conscious experience, created and conditioned by choices made in the
past.

The "outer" aspect of the sixth sense is *dhammā*, a term
so ambiguous its translation is always difficult. Here it refers to
anything that may be known directly by the mind, distinct from the five
physical senses. The most technically correct translation is probably
"mental phenomena". However, this is clumsy and opaque, so "thought" may
be used as a more colloquial rendering, so long as it is understood to
include ideas, imagination, and so on, not just verbalized cognition.

The term *āyatana* refers to something "stretched out", a
domain, field, or dimension of activity. However, the Visuddhimagga
suggests that the sense of the word is primarily a "cause", or perhaps
"stimulus":

> ... base (*āyatana*) should be understood as such (a)
> because of its actuating (*āyatana*), (b) because of
> being the range (*tanana*) of the origins (*āya*), and
> (c) because of leading on (*nayana*) what is actuated
> (*āyata*). *Path of Purification*, XV.4, translated by
> Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoḷi.

Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoḷi rendered the term accordingly as "base",
which has been followed by Bhikkhu Bodhi. But this commentarial
explanation is merely a series of false etymologies, or rather, puns.
The point of such explanations is to provide material for teachers to
reflect on and use in teaching, and they shouldn't be taken
uncritically. In fact the verbal root is not the obscure
*āyatati* ("to actuate") but *āyamati*, "to
stretch, to extend". *Āyatana* is commonly used in this sense and may be
translated as "field", "dimension", etc.

As so often, the context draws upon and redefines Brahmanical
terminology. The "six sense fields" (*saḷāyatana*) were
first mentioned in the Buddha's third teaching, the famous Fire
Discourse (Ādittapariyāya Sutta) which appears in this
collection at [SN 35.28](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.28). This sermon
was given to a large assembly of Brahmanical ascetics, following a
period when the Buddha stayed in their "firehouse", a kind of shrine
room for worshiping the sacred flame. And in Sanskrit, this place is
called an *āyatana*. The Upaniṣads also call
the senses *āyatana* in the sense of fields or scopes of
activity and experience (eg. Bṛhadāraṇyaka
Upaniṣad 4.1.4: *cakṣur
evāyatanam*, Bṛhadāraṇyaka
Upaniṣad 6.1.5: *mano vā
āyatanam*; Chāndogya Upaniṣad
5.1.5: *mano ha vā āyatanam*).

When the Buddha told those ascetics that "all is burning", he was not
giving an Abhidhamma analysis, for it was many centuries before
Abhidhamma was developed. He was speaking in terms that the brahmins
could understand.

One of the key projects of the Brahmanical Upaniṣads was to
reinterpret the deities of the Vedas. Rather than thinking of them as
entities who lived in the sky, they became forces or essences that
imbued all of reality. So for the brahmin ascetics, the flame (*agni*)
was worshiped as the embodiment of a sacred energy that was immanent in
all things.

The teachings of the Fire Sermon respond to several key
Upaniṣadic passages. In Bṛhadāraṇyaka
Upaniṣad 1.3, it is told how evil entered into the world by
the actions of the demons (*asuras*). While the gods (*devas*) were
performing the ritual, they entered into the various senses and
corrupted them, tainting them with evil and death. Hence when suffering
is experienced through the senses, this is the reason. But those same
senses can be freed from this corruption by being carried beyond death.

These purified, divine senses are further described at
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.5.1, the famous
"Honey-Knowledge", regarded as one of the highest and most secret
teachings. It presents a template, applied to various kinds of things.
These are not organized as rationally as the Buddhist doctrines but
include quite different kinds of things in the same set, such as the
elements, truth, the sun, etc. Nevertheless, the parallels with the
teachings of the six senses are quite apparent.

> *ayam ādityaḥ sarveṣāṁ bhūtānāṁ
> madhu*\
> This sun is the honey of all beings.\
> *asyādityasya sarvāṇi bhūtāni
> madhu*\
> All beings are the honey of the sun.\
> *yaś cāyam asminn āditye
> tejomayo 'mṛtamayaḥ puruṣo yaś
> cāyam adhyātmaṁ cākṣuṣas
> tejomayo 'mṛtamayaḥ puruṣo 'yam eva sa yo
> 'yam ātmā*\
> This person in the sun made of fire and immortality, and this person
> in the internal eye made of fire and immortality: this is that---that
> which is the self.\
> *idam amṛtam idaṁ brahmedaṁ
> sarvam*\
> This is the immortal, this is the divine, this is the all.\
> (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.5.5, translation
> by myself.)

The Brahmanical view is that all creation stems from Brahmā
and hence is, in its truest essence, overflowing with divinity and
bliss---honey. Any suffering is merely a temporary imperfection.

This is how they handled the great challenge to any theistic system, the
problem of evil. For the brahmins, to focus on suffering is to miss the
point. This is not merely a facile "positive thinking" doctrine, it is a
profoundly contemplative philosophy, worked out in great detail across
many complex sacred texts, and informed by deep meditative practice. It
does not deny the reality of suffering, but it evokes a deeper reality
that suffering cannot reach.

Rather than tackling the textual and philosophical issues, the Buddha
preferred to point directly at experience. Divested of theology, the
experience of our senses is not "honey" but "fire". And while our
philosophy may say that fire is sacred, the reality is that it burns.
The Buddha was showing the ascetics that there is no need to invoke
deities and metaphysics to understand their experience: they could see
how it worked right here.

The forces lighting that fire can be readily discerned: greed, hate, and
delusion. This classic Buddhist presentation of the fundamental
defilements appears first in this passage. It is correlated with the
three feelings: pleasant feeling stimulates desire; painful feeling
provokes hate; and neutral feeling slips into delusion ([MN
44:25](https://suttacentral.net/mn44/en/sujato#25), [MN
128:28](https://suttacentral.net/mn128/en/sujato#28), [SN
36.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn36.3)).

The Fire Sermon, in its brevity, foreshadows several distinctive
features of the teachings on the six senses as compared to the five
aggregates. It is direct, emotional, and powerful, speaking of the world
that is burning, in contrast with the more intellectual approach of the
aggregates.

By invoking the idea of the "all", the Fire Sermon suggests that the
scope of the six senses includes all that is experienced and known. This
idea was expanded in multiple Suttas ([SN
35.33--52](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.33)). By contrast, no such
claim to completeness is made of the aggregates. And the text treats
sense experience as a conditioned process, the immediately visible
dimension of dependent origination.

Since the sense fields make experience possible, it is through them that
suffering comes to be ([SN 35.106](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.106)).
It is in order to understand this suffering that one undertakes the
spiritual path ([SN 35.81](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.81), [SN
35.152](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.152)). The sense fields are, in
fact, the world (*loka*) that wears away (*lujjati*; [SN
35.82](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.82), [SN
35.84](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.84)), for "whatever in the world
through which you perceive the world and conceive the world is called
the world in the training of the noble one" ([SN
35.116](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.116)). This world is empty of self
([SN 35.85](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.85)).

Since the sense fields are produced by choices made in past lives, they
are said to be "old kamma"; in this, they contrast with the aggregates,
for they include "choices", which are the kamma made in the present.
Having inherited the senses as the result of past deeds, however, we
proceed to respond to them through thinking or conceiving of them in
terms of a "self", a process known in Pali as "identifying"
(*maññita*; [SN 35.146](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.146),
[SN 35.30--32](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.30), [SN
35.90--91](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.90), [SN
35.248](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.248)).

"Conceiving" and the closely related "conceit" (*māna*)
refer to the tendency of the mind to shape experience in terms of the
self. Much of our thought is devoted to justifying, explaining, and
interpreting our experience in ways that reinforce our notion of self.
This can end up spinning out of control, in which case it is called
"proliferation" (*papañca*). To cut through this process
the Buddha urges us to stop short with sense experience ([SN
35.94](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.94), [SN
35.95](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.95)).

It is significant that, while the texts repeatedly speak of how the
aggregates form the basis for theories of self (*sakkāya*),
the same is *not* said of the sense fields. If the aggregates provoke
grasping to theories, the sense fields provoke grasping at *pleasure*,
at the sheer vitality of sensory experience. Thus while the teachings on
the aggregates emphasize *views*, here the focus shifts to *restraint*.
A standard passage on sense restraint, familiar from the Gradual
Training, speaks of preventing harmful qualities from invading the mind
amid sense experience ([SN 35.120](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.120),
[SN 35.127](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.127), [SN
35.239](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.239), [SN
35.240](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.240)). A person who chases the
pleasure afforded by the senses is no less trapped by the pain they
bring, and it is only by setting up mindfulness that one can achieve
peace ([SN 35.132](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.132), [SN
35.243--244](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.243), [SN
35.247](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.247)).

In this way, by choosing the sense fields as a locus of practice one
cuts directly at the roots of craving. This is emphasized in the final
two *vaggas*, which are especially rich in unforgettable imagery. The
senses are an ocean traversed during the spiritual journey ([SN
35.228](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.228)). We'd be better off being
tortured by hot pokers than being caught up in sense experience ([SN
35.235](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.235)). If you wish to train in
meditation, you must learn to withdraw the senses like a tortoise
drawing in its limbs, becoming safe from predators ([SN
35.240](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.240)). Pleasant experiences are
the bait of Māra ([SN
35.230](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.230)). The six senses are like six
very different animals, all tied together, and fighting to get to their
territory ([SN 35.247](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.247)).
