## The Book of the Aggregates

The "Book of the Aggregates" is the third of the five books of the
Linked Discourses. It is named after the first and longest
*saṁyutta*, which deals with the core Buddhist teaching of
the five aggregates in 159 discourses. Of the remaining twelve
*saṁyuttas*, three also take up the theme of the
aggregates, while the remainder deal with miscellaneous secondary
themes, some organized by subject, others by person.

The "five grasping aggregates"
(*pañc'upādānakkhandhā*) were mentioned in the
first sermon as the summary of the noble truth of suffering ([SN
56.11](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11)), and became a foundational
teaching in all forms of Buddhism.

The basic idea of an "aggregate" (*khandha*) is a set or class of
phenomena. The "five aggregates" are the various sets of phenomena so
classified.

The five aggregates are almost always said to be "grasping" aggregates.
The term "grasping" (*upādāna*) has a complex and
multi-layered relation to the basic term.

- The aggregates are the *subject* of grasping, in that they are the
  things that are normally attached to and taken to be the permanent
  "self".

- But they are not merely passive spectators: they are also the
 *functional support* of grasping, the things that make grasping work.
  This is probably the basic metaphor of the set, as the five aggregates
  correspond to the five fingers of a hand, which perform the act of
  grasping. Grasping is something that the aggregates do. In this
  metaphor, the "thumb" is consciousness, which stands against the other
  four.

- As active participants in the process of grasping, they *stimulate*
  grasping to themselves (*upādāniya*).

- And finally, they are the *product* of grasping in the sense that
  attachments in past lives have given rise to the aggregates in this
  life (*upādiṇṇa*).

Here is a brief analysis of each of the five.

Form (*rūpa*)

:   "Physical phenomena", or sometimes simply "body", understood as
    consisting of the four primary physical properties: earth (solid),
    water (liquidity), fire (heat), and air (gas), and anything material
    derived from these, such as the impressions of the five material
    senses. *Rūpa* is more extensive in scope than the
    Western concept of "matter". It includes material properties that
    are perceived purely in the mind, such as shape or color seen as
    visions in meditation.

Feeling (*vedanā*)

:   The pleasant, painful, or neutral tone of experience born from the
    six senses.

Perception (*saññā*)

:   The recognition or interpretation of experience through the six
    senses. Perception refers to that function of the mind which
    organizes the dizzyingly complex and chaotic input of present
    experience based on past experience. The eye, for example, does not
    see "blue" or "yellow", it only sees light in various frequencies
    and amplitudes. Perception recognizes that these inputs correspond
    to the concept "blue" or "yellow" ([SN
    22.79](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.79)), and so it enables us to
    live in a world of (relatively) permanent and predictable entities
    and ideas. While perception thus makes consciousness possible, it
    also can trap us into seeing things only in terms of the past. In
    the legal discussions of the Vinaya, it is common to discuss cases
    where a mendicant's actions are based on a perception that turns out
    to be incorrect.

Choices (*saṅkhārā*)

:   Intention, will, or volition (*cetanā*); the choice to
    perform an act, especially one with an ethical dimension. It is
    choices that create the five aggregates ([SN
    22.79](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.79)). Later forms of Buddhism,
    starting with the Abhidhamma texts, treated this aggregate as if it
    were a catch-all, whose purpose was to include everything not
    mentioned under the other aggregates. However, this is not the case
    in the early texts, where there is no indication that
   *saṅkhārā* in this context means anything other than
    "volition, choice".

Consciousness (*viññāṇa*)

:   The subjective process of awareness itself. As in dependent
    origination, consciousness is said to depend on name & form.

Except perception, all of these are also found in dependent origination,
where they have similar definitions. Whereas dependent origination shows
the unfolding of the process of suffering in time, the teaching on the
aggregates focuses on those aspects of present experience that are most
apt to be taken as a self. In [SN 22.5](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.5)
the grasping to the aggregates is shown as the very same grasping that
leads to rebirth as shown in dependent origination. [SN
22.54](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.54) furthers this argument,
asserting that it is impossible to speak of rebirth without referring to
the aggregates.

From the very first teaching of the Buddha ([SN
56.11](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11)) we learn that the aggregates
are suffering. In the second sermon---the Discourse on Not-Self
(Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta) at [SN
22.59](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.59)---this brief statement is drawn
out in further dialogue with the group of five ascetics. Each of the
aggregates leads to affliction and one cannot simply decree that the
aggregates be whatever one wants; hence they cannot be a self. Further,
each of the aggregates is impermanent and therefore suffering, which
again rules out the possibility that they are a self. Seeing in this
way, a practitioner lets go of attachment to the aggregates and realizes
freedom. It was while listening to this discourse that the five ascetics
all became perfected ones.

While the doctrine of the "three marks" is found throughout all Buddhist
texts, it is here in the Khandha Saṁyutta that it rises to
prominence. Here is a brief outline.

Impermanence (*anicca*)

:   All conditioned phenomena are produced and maintained by causes and
    hence can only last so long as the causes sustain them. Impermanence
    is a fractal phenomenon; it is how reality is structured at every
    level. It applies equally to the grandest scale of universes and the
    lifespans of the gods as it does to the incessant breaking up and
    vanishing of conditions from moment to moment. But in the five
    aggregates, the main focus is on the scale of human existence, where
    the emotional impact of impermanence is felt most keenly in death.

Suffering (*dukkha*)

:   At its simplest level this refers to painful feelings, whether
    physical or mental (*dukkha-dukkhatā*). By itself, this
    is a profound observation, as virtually every moment of our waking
    lives is afflicted by some form of pain or irritation. But suffering
    runs deeper than that, for even when we do experience pleasure, it
    cannot be sustained. The second bite of a mango is delicious---but
    not quite as delicious as the first
    (*vipariṇāma-dukkhatā*). Finally, even the
    most profound of pleasures, such as the bliss of deep meditation, is
    never as peaceful as *nibbāna*, since by its nature it
    is conditioned and unstable (*saṅkhāradukkhatā*). No
    experience is as peaceful as cessation.

Not-self (*anattā*)

:   The most subtle and distinctive of the three marks, not-self is the
    most apt to be misunderstood. It is primarily an anti-metaphysical
    doctrine, not a psychological one. It is intended to rule out the
    various kinds of self or soul proposed by the philosophers at the
    time of the Buddha. It does this by pointing out that all the self
    doctrines end up identifying one or other of the aggregates as self;
    but they do not have the nature that the self is supposed to have.
    This meaning is quite different from the modern psychological notion
    of self, and it is inappropriate, and potentially harmful, to apply
    the teaching of not-self in cases where a person is suffering from a
    disorder of identity.

Let us dwell a little further on the idea of self and not-self, which is
best understood in its historical context. From a few centuries before
the Buddha, Indian sages and philosophers had become fascinated by the
subjective nature of experience. They wondered who it was, in the true
and ultimate sense, that was the one referred to as "I".

Initial theories built on simple animist notions, imaging the self as an
external physical totem, or even as a little man who lived in the chest.
Others theorized that the self was the heart, or the breath, or some
other physical attribute. But all of these may be refuted by simple
empirical observation. Sometimes a totem may be destroyed, yet a person
lives. When you watch a person who is asleep, no little man may be
observed leaving by the mouth. And when a trumpeter expels all their
breath, they do not drop down dead.

So what then is this self if not something material? Perhaps, rather, it
is feeling, the bliss experienced by one who goes to a beautiful realm
after death. But this cannot be so, for feeling, too, is impermanent
([DN 15](https://suttacentral.net/dn15)). Then could the self be
perception ([DN 1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1))? But no, perception
too is tricky and unreliable, like an illusion. Is self then one's
choices? A man, after all, is defined by the decisions he makes. But
these too are seen to be impermanent and unreliable; oft-times one makes
bad choices, or the results of a choice are not what one hopes.

Unsatisfied, the sages of the Upaniṣads rejected all such
limited conceptions of the Self (Bṛhadāraṇyaka
Upaniṣad 3.9.26: *neti! neti!*). They arrived at their most
profound thesis: the self in its highest sense was awareness itself, the
sheer mass of consciousness (Bṛhadāraṇyaka
Upaniṣad 2.4.12: *vijnāna-ghanam'eva*). The
true nature of the self is the supreme divinity
(Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.4.10:
*ahaṁ brahmāsmīti*; cp. [DN
1:2](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#2), [DN
11:81](https://suttacentral.net/dn11/en/sujato#81), [DN
24:2](https://suttacentral.net/dn24/en/sujato#2): *ahamasmi
brahmā*). This insight is expressed in the
Upaniṣads as the famous "thou art that"
(Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.8.7: *tat tvam asi*),
and the Pali texts as "I am that" ( [SN
22.8](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.8): *eso hamasmi*). "That" may be
anything one identifies as self. But to one who understands rightly (*ya
evaṁ veda*) the divine self is nothing less than the
entirety of the universe: "the self is identical with the cosmos" ([SN
22.81](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.81): *so attā so
loko*, cp. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.2.7:
*tasyeme lokā ātmānaḥ*, 4.5.7:
*idaṁ brahmedaṁ kṣatram ime
lokā ime devā ime vedā
imāni bhūtānīdaṁ sarvaṁ yad ayam
ātmā*). This philosophy is most closely associated with
Yajnavalkya, a Brahmanical sage who lived in the same region as the
Buddha (Mithilā), perhaps a century or two earlier.

While the exact form of these arguments may seem archaic, we still cling
to the aggregates in similar ways. We think of our possessions and
belongings---homes, clothes, cars---as expressions of our self, and are
upset when they are damaged or criticized. We attach, too, to our
physical bodies, reveling in health, or imagining that we will survive
through the propagation of our DNA. We attach to pleasure, thinking that
happiness will last. We attach to our perceptions, such as our sense of
belonging to a nation or religion, or our idea of ourselves as a good
person. We attach to our choices, taking pride in our ability to make
decisions. Finally, we attach to our consciousness, especially as we
purify awareness in meditation.

Thus one of the key functions of the aggregates was to categorize
theories of the self, moving from simple to profound. This seems to have
been familiar to philosophers before the Buddha. The aggregates are
mentioned in passing in the first sermon as if it is taken for granted
that the five ascetics would know them. Many of the sectarian views of
self in [DN 1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1) Brahmajāla
Sutta refer to the aggregates in one way or another. And elsewhere, the
non-Buddhist ascetic Saccaka asserted that the five aggregates were the
self ([MN 35](https://suttacentral.net/mn35)). Nevertheless, the
aggregates have not been identified in any pre-Buddhist texts.

Regardless of whether the set of categories was pre-Buddhist, the Buddha
treated them in his distinctive way, emphasizing that when examined, the
aggregates turn out to lack the qualities of permanence, surety, and
refuge that are intrinsic to the idea of a true self. But our grasping
and identification are strong and have been built up over a long time,
so it is not enough to merely acknowledge this on an intellectual level.
Hence in the Khandha Saṁyutta we find the core teachings
emphasized again and again. The Buddha constantly reminds the mendicants
that the aggregates lead to sorrow and despair ([SN
22.7](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.7)), that they are aggravating ([SN
22.79](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.79)), that desire for them must be
given up ([SN 22.137](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.137)), that they are
alien ([SN 22.33](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.33)). One who identifies
with the aggregates is like a man who hires an assassin as a servant
([SN 22.85](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.85)). They are suffering in
the past and future just as they are today ([SN
22.10](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.10)).

The view that the aggregates are self is called "identity view"
(*sakkāyadiṭṭhi*). It is possible to identify with any or
all of the aggregates in a myriad of ways, commonly set out as twenty
forms of identity view ([SN 22.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.1),
etc.). Identity view leashes an unenlightened person to transmigration
like a dog tied to a post, pointlessly running around and around ([SN
22.99](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.99)).

Several discourses emphasize that to understand the aggregates it is
essential to develop the deep stillness of immersion meditation ([SN
22.5](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.5), [SN
22.6](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.6)). But meditative realization is
not something that just happens automatically; one must continually
contemplate and observe the aggregates ([SN
22.40](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.40), etc.).

In this collection we find a large number of striking and lively
narratives, showing how the aggregates could be a solace at the time of
old age ([SN 22.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.1)), a guide to the
knotty theoretical debates on identity, or a framework for insight
meditation.
