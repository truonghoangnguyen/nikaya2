# Linked Discourses on the Right Efforts

## The Chapter of Abbreviated Texts on the Ganges

### N 49.1--12 Sloping East, Etc. *Gaṅgāpeyyālavagga*

At Sāvatthī.

There the Buddha said:

"Mendicants, there are these four right efforts. What four?

It's when a mendicant generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort,
exerts the mind, and strives so that bad, unskillful qualities don't
arise.

They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and
strive so that bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up.

They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and
strive so that skillful qualities arise.

They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and
strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost,
but increase, mature, and are completed by development. These are the
four right efforts.

The Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east. In the same
way, a mendicant who develops and cultivates the four right efforts
slants, slopes, and inclines to extinguishment.

And how does a mendicant who develops the four right efforts slant,
slope, and incline to extinguishment?

They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and
strive so that bad, unskillful qualities don't arise.

They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and
strive so that bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up.

They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and
strive so that skillful qualities arise.

They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and
strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost,
but increase, mature, and are completed by development.

That's how a mendicant who develops and cultivates the four right
efforts slants, slopes, and inclines to extinguishment."

## The Chapter on Hard Work

### N 49.23--34 Hard Work, Etc. *Balakaraṇīyavagga*

"Mendicants, all the hard work that gets done depends on the earth and
is grounded on the earth. In the same way, a mendicant develops and
cultivates the four right efforts depending on and grounded on ethics.

How so? It's when a mendicant generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an
effort, exerts the mind, and strives so that bad, unskillful qualities
don't arise. ... so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are
not lost, but increase, mature, and are completed by development.

That's how a mendicant develops and cultivates the four right efforts
depending on and grounded on ethics."

## The Chapter on Searches

### N 49.35--44 Ten Discourses on Searches, Etc. *Esanāvagga*

"Mendicants, there are these three searches. What three? The search for
sensual pleasures, the search for continued existence, and the search
for a spiritual path. These are the three searches.

The four right efforts should be developed for the direct knowledge,
complete understanding, finishing, and giving up of these three
searches. What four? It's when a mendicant generates enthusiasm, tries,
makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives so that bad, unskillful
qualities don't arise. ... so that skillful qualities that have arisen
remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are completed by
development.

These four right efforts should be developed for the direct knowledge,
complete understanding, finishing, and giving up of these three
searches."

## The Chapter on Floods

### N 49.45--54 Floods, Etc. *Oghavagga*

"Mendicants, there are five higher fetters. What five? Desire for
rebirth in the realm of luminous form, desire for rebirth in the
formless realm, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. These are the five
higher fetters.

The four right efforts should be developed for the direct knowledge,
complete understanding, finishing, and giving up of these five higher
fetters. What four? It's when a mendicant generates enthusiasm, tries,
makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives so that bad, unskillful
qualities don't arise. ... so that skillful qualities that have arisen
remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are completed by
development.

These four right efforts should be developed for the direct knowledge,
complete understanding, finishing, and giving up of these five higher
fetters."
