# Linked Discourses on Stream-Entry

## The Chapter at Bamboo Gate

### N 55.1 A Wheel-Turning Monarch *Cakkavattirājasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

There the Buddha ... said:

"Mendicants, suppose a wheel-turning monarch were to rule as sovereign
lord over these four continents. And when his body breaks up, after
death, he's reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of
the gods of the thirty-three. There he entertains himself in the Garden
of Delight, escorted by a band of nymphs, and supplied and provided with
the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation. Still, as he's lacking
four things, he's not exempt from hell, the animal realm, or the ghost
realm. He's not exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld.

Now suppose a noble disciple wears rags and feeds on scraps of almsfood.
Still, as they have four things, they're exempt from hell, the animal
realm, or the ghost realm. They're exempt from places of loss, bad
places, the underworld.

What four? It's when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the
Buddha: 'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha,
accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world,
supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans,
awakened, blessed.'

They have experiential confidence in the teaching: 'The teaching is well
explained by the Buddha---apparent in the present life, immediately
effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can
know it for themselves.'

They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: 'The
Saṅgha of the Buddha's disciples is practicing the way
that's good, sincere, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four
pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the
Buddha's disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods,
worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of
greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the
world.'

Furthermore, a noble disciple's ethical conduct is loved by the noble
ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised
by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion.

These are the four qualities that they have.

And, mendicants, gaining these four continents is not worth a sixteenth
part of gaining these four things."

### N 55.2 The Culmination of the Spiritual Life *Brahmacariyogadhasutta*

"Mendicants, a noble disciple who has four things is a stream-enterer,
not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.

What four? It's when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the
Buddha ... the teaching ... the Saṅgha ... And they have
the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones ... leading to immersion. A
noble disciple who has these four things is a stream-enterer, not liable
to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "Those who have faith and ethics,\
> confidence, and vision of the truth,\
> in time arrive at happiness,\
> the culmination of the spiritual life."

### N 55.3 With Dīghāvu *Dīghāvuupāsakasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the
Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding ground.

Now at that time the lay follower Dīghāvu was sick,
suffering, gravely ill. Then he addressed his father, the householder
Jotika, "Please, householder, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with
your head to his feet. Say to him: 'Sir, the lay follower
Dīghāvu is sick, suffering, gravely ill. He bows with his
head to your feet.' And then say: 'Sir, please visit him at his home out
of sympathy.'"

"Yes, dear," replied Jotika. He did as Dīghāvu asked. The
Buddha consented with silence.

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
went to the home of the lay follower Dīghāvu, sat down on
the seat spread out, and said to him, "I hope you're keeping well,
Dīghāvu; I hope you're all right. I hope that your pain is
fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing."

"Sir, I'm not keeping well, I'm not getting by. The pain is terrible and
growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading."

"So, Dīghāvu, you should train like this: 'I will have
experiential confidence in the Buddha ... the teaching ... the
Saṅgha ... And I will have the ethical conduct loved by the
noble ones ... leading to immersion.' That's how you should train."

"Sir, these four factors of stream-entry that were taught by the Buddha
are found in me, and I exhibit them. For I have experiential confidence
in the Buddha ... the teaching ... the Saṅgha ... And I
have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones ... leading to
immersion."

"In that case, Dīghāvu, grounded on these four factors of
stream-entry you should further develop these six things that play a
part in realization. You should meditate observing the impermanence of
all conditions, perceiving suffering in impermanence, perceiving
not-self in suffering, perceiving giving up, perceiving fading away, and
perceiving cessation. That's how you should train."

"These six things that play a part in realization that were taught by
the Buddha are found in me, and I exhibit them. For I meditate observing
the impermanence of all conditions, perceiving suffering in
impermanence, perceiving not-self in suffering, perceiving giving up,
perceiving fading away, and perceiving cessation.

But still, sir, I think, 'I hope Jotika doesn't suffer distress when
I've gone.'" Jotika said, "Dear Dīghāvu, don't focus on
that. Come on, dear Dīghāvu, you should closely focus on
what the Buddha is saying."

When the Buddha had given this advice he got up from his seat and left.
Not long after the Buddha left, Dīghāvu passed away. Then
several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,
and said to him:

"Sir, the lay follower named Dīghāvu, who was advised in
brief by the Buddha, has passed away. Where has he been reborn in his
next life?"

"Mendicants, the lay follower Dīghāvu was astute. He
practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the
teachings. With the ending of the five lower fetters, he's been reborn
spontaneously, and will become extinguished there, not liable to return
from that world."

### N 55.4 With Sāriputta (1st) *Paṭhamasāriputtasutta*

At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Ānanda came out of
retreat ... and said to Sāriputta:

"Reverend, how many things do people have to possess in order for the
Buddha to declare that they're a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn
in the underworld, bound for awakening?"

"Reverend, people have to possess four things in order for the Buddha to
declare that they're a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the
underworld, bound for awakening.

What four? It's when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the
Buddha ... the teaching ... the Saṅgha ... And they have
the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones ... leading to immersion.
People have to possess these four things in order for the Buddha to
declare that they're a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the
underworld, bound for awakening."

### N 55.5 With Sāriputta (2nd) *Dutiyasāriputtasutta*

Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down
to one side. The Buddha said to him:

"Sāriputta, they speak of a 'factor of stream-entry'. What
is a factor of stream-entry?"

"Sir, the factors of stream-entry are associating with true persons,
listening to the true teaching, rational application of mind, and
practicing in line with the teaching."

"Good, good, Sāriputta! For the factors of stream-entry are
associating with true persons, listening to the true teaching, rational
application of mind, and practicing in line with the teaching.

Sāriputta, they speak of 'the stream'. What is the stream?"

"Sir, the stream is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right
view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right
effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion."

"Good, good, Sāriputta! For the stream is simply this noble
eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right
action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right
immersion.

Sāriputta, they speak of 'a stream-enterer'. What is a
stream-enterer?"

"Sir, anyone who possesses this noble eightfold path is called a
stream-enterer, the venerable of such and such name and clan."

"Good, good, Sāriputta! For anyone who possesses this noble
eightfold path is called a stream-enterer, the venerable of such and
such name and clan."

### N 55.6 The Chamberlains *Thapatisutta*

At Sāvatthī. At that time several mendicants were making a
robe for the Buddha, thinking that when his robe was finished and the
three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out
wandering. Now at that time the chamberlains Isidatta and
Purāṇa were residing in Sādhuka on some
business. They heard about this.

So they posted someone on the road, saying:

"My good man, let us know when you see the Blessed One coming, the
perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha." And that person stood there
for two or three days before they saw the Buddha coming off in the
distance. When they saw him, they went to the chamberlains and said:

"Sirs, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha is
coming. Please come at your convenience."

Then the chamberlains went up to the Buddha, bowed, and followed behind
him. And then the Buddha left the road, went to the root of a certain
tree, and sat down on the seat spread out. The master builders Isidatta
and Purāṇa bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the
Buddha:

"Sir, when we hear that you will be setting out from
Sāvatthī to wander in the Kosalan lands, we're sad and
upset, thinking that you will be far from us. And when we hear that you
are setting out from Sāvatthī to wander in the Kosalan
lands, we're sad and upset, thinking that you are far from us.

And when we hear that you will be setting out from the Kosalan lands to
wander in the Mallian lands, we're sad and upset, thinking that you will
be far from us. And when we hear that you are setting out from the
Kosalan lands to wander in the Mallian lands, we're sad and upset,
thinking that you are far from us.

And when we hear that you will be setting out from the Mallian lands to
wander in the Vajjian lands ...

you will be setting out from the Vajjian lands to wander in the
Kāsian lands ...

you will be setting out from the Kāsian lands to wander in
the Magadhan lands ...

you are setting out from the Kāsian lands to wander in the
Magadhan lands, we're sad and upset, thinking that you are far from us.

But when we hear that you will be setting out from the Magadhan lands to
wander in the Kāsian lands, we're happy and joyful,
thinking that you will be near to us. And when we hear that you are
setting out from the Magadhan lands to wander in the Kāsian
lands ...

you will be setting out from the Kāsian lands to wander in
the Vajjian lands ...

you will be setting out from the Vajjian lands to wander in the Mallian
lands ...

you will be setting out from the Mallian lands to wander in the Kosalan
lands ...

you will be setting out in the Kosalan lands to wander to
Sāvatthī, we're happy and joyful, thinking that you will be
near to us.

And when we hear that you are staying near Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery we have no little
happiness and joy, thinking that you are near to us."

"Well then, chamberlains, life at home is cramped and dirty, life gone
forth is wide open. Just this much is enough to be diligent."

"Sir, for us there is something that's even more cramped than that, and
is considered as such."

"What is that?"

"Sir, it's when King Pasenadi of Kosala wants to go and visit a park. We
have to harness and prepare his royal elephants. Then we have to seat
his dear and beloved wives on the elephants, one in front of us, and one
behind. Those sisters smell like a freshly opened perfume box; that's
how the royal ladies smell with makeup on. The touch of those sisters is
like a tuft of cotton-wool or kapok; that's how dainty the royal ladies
are. Now at that time we must look after the elephants, the sisters, and
ourselves. But we don't recall having a bad thought regarding those
sisters. This is that thing that's even more cramped than that, and is
considered as such."

"Well then, chamberlains, life at home is cramped and dirty, life gone
forth is wide open. Just this much is enough to be diligent. A noble
disciple who has four things is a stream-enterer, not liable to be
reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.

What four? It's when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the
Buddha ... the teaching ... the Saṅgha ... They live at
home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed,
loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share. A
noble disciple who has these four things is a stream-enterer, not liable
to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.

And you have experiential confidence in the Buddha ... the teaching ...
the Saṅgha ... And whatever there is in your family that's
available to give, you share it all with those who are ethical, of good
character.

What do you think, chamberlains? How many people among the Kosalans are
your equal when it comes to giving and sharing?"

"We're fortunate, sir, so very fortunate, in that the Buddha understands
us like this."

### N 55.7 The People of Bamboo Gate *Veḷudvāreyyasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was wandering in
the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of
mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named
Bamboo Gate. The brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate heard:

"It seems the ascetic Gotama---a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan
family---has arrived at Bamboo Gate, together with a large
Saṅgha of mendicants. He has this good reputation: 'That
Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in
knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for
those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.'
He has realized with his own insight this world---with its gods,
Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics
and brahmins, gods and humans---and he makes it known to others. He
proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle,
and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a
spiritual practice that's entirely full and pure. It's good to see such
perfected ones."

Then the brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate went up to the Buddha.
Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings
and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the
Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.
Seated to one side they said to the Buddha:

"Worthy Gotama, these are our wishes, desires, and hopes. We wish to
live at home with our children; to use sandalwood imported from
Kāsi; to wear garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and to
accept gold and currency. And when our body breaks up, after death, we
wish to be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. Given that we have
such wishes, may the Buddha teach us the Dhamma so that we may achieve
them."

"Householders, I will teach you an explanation of the Dhamma that
applies to oneself. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"And what is the explanation of the Dhamma that applies to oneself?

It's when a noble disciple reflects: 'I want to live and don't want to
die; I want to be happy and recoil from pain. Since this is so, if
someone were to take my life, I wouldn't like that. But others also want
to live and don't want to die; they want to be happy and recoil from
pain. So if I were to take the life of someone else, they wouldn't like
that either. The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by
others. Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on someone
else?' Reflecting in this way, they give up killing living creatures
themselves. And they encourage others to give up killing living
creatures, praising the giving up of killing living creatures. So their
bodily behavior is purified in three points.

Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects: 'If someone were to steal from
me, I wouldn't like that. But if I were to steal from someone else, they
wouldn't like that either. The thing that is disliked by me is also
disliked by others. Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on
someone else?' Reflecting in this way, they give up stealing themselves.
And they encourage others to give up stealing, praising the giving up of
stealing. So their bodily behavior is purified in three points.

Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects: 'If someone were to have sexual
relations with my wives, I wouldn't like it. But if I were to have
sexual relations with someone else's wives, he wouldn't like that
either. The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by others.
Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on others?' Reflecting
in this way, they give up sexual misconduct themselves. And they
encourage others to give up sexual misconduct, praising the giving up of
sexual misconduct. So their bodily behavior is purified in three points.

Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects: 'If someone were to distort my
meaning by lying, I wouldn't like it. But if I were to distort someone
else's meaning by lying, they wouldn't like it either. The thing that is
disliked by me is also disliked by someone else. Since I dislike this
thing, how can I inflict it on others?' Reflecting in this way, they
give up lying themselves. And they encourage others to give up lying,
praising the giving up of lying. So their verbal behavior is purified in
three points.

Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects: 'If someone were to break me up
from my friends by divisive speech, I wouldn't like it. But if I were to
break someone else from their friends by divisive speech, they wouldn't
like it either. ...' So their verbal behavior is purified in three
points.

Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects: 'If someone were to attack me
with harsh speech, I wouldn't like it. But if I were to attack someone
else with harsh speech, they wouldn't like it either. ...' So their
verbal behavior is purified in three points.

Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects: 'If someone were to annoy me by
talking silliness and nonsense, I wouldn't like it. But if I were to
annoy someone else by talking silliness and nonsense, they wouldn't like
it either.' The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by
another. Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on another?'
Reflecting in this way, they give up talking nonsense themselves. And
they encourage others to give up talking nonsense, praising the giving
up of talking nonsense. So their verbal behavior is purified in three
points.

And they have experiential confidence in the Buddha ... the teaching ...
the Saṅgha ... And they have the ethical conduct loved by
the noble ones ... leading to immersion. When a noble disciple has these
seven good qualities and these four desirable states they may, if they
wish, declare of themselves: 'I've finished with rebirth in hell, the
animal realm, and the ghost realm. I've finished with all places of
loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I'm not liable
to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.'"

When he had spoken, the brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate said to
the Buddha, "Excellent, worthy Gotama! ... We go for refuge to the
worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant
Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember
us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life."

### N 55.8 In the Brick Hall (1st) *Paṭhamagiñjakāvasathasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at
Ñātika in the brick house. Then Venerable Ānanda went up to
the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, the monk named Sāḷha has passed away. Where has he
been reborn in his next life? The nun named Nandā, the
layman named Sudatta, and the laywoman named Sujātā have
passed away. Where have they been reborn in the next life?"

"Ānanda, the monk Sāḷha passed away having realized the
undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life,
having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of
defilements.

The nun Nandā passed away having ended the five lower
fetters. She's been reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished
there, not liable to return from that world.

The layman Sudatta passed away having ended three fetters, and weakened
greed, hate, and delusion. He's a once-returner; he will come back to
this world once only, then make an end of suffering.

The laywoman Sujātā passed away having ended three fetters.
She's a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound
for awakening.

It's no wonder that a human being should pass away. But if you should
come and ask me about it each and every time someone dies that would be
a bother for me. So Ānanda, I will teach you the explanation of the
Dhamma called 'the mirror of the teaching'. A noble disciple who has
this may declare of themselves: 'I've finished with rebirth in hell, the
animal realm, and the ghost realm. I've finished with all places of
loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I'm not liable
to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.'

And what is that mirror of the teaching?

It's when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha ...
the teaching ... the Saṅgha ... And they have the ethical
conduct loved by the noble ones ... leading to immersion. This is that
mirror of the teaching. A noble disciple who has this may declare of
themselves: 'I've finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and
the ghost realm. I've finished with all places of loss, bad places, the
underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I'm not liable to be reborn in the
underworld, and am bound for awakening.'"

**(The following two discourses have the same setting.)**

### N 55.9 At the Brick Hall (2nd) *Dutiyagiñjakāvasathasutta*

Ānanda said to the Buddha:

"Sir, the monk named Asoka has passed away. Where has he been reborn in
his next life? The nun named Asokā, the layman named Asoka,
and the laywoman named Asokā have passed away. Where have
they been reborn in the next life?"

"Ānanda, the monk Asoka passed away having realized the undefiled
freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life ...

**(And all is explained as in SN 55.8.)**

This is that mirror of the teaching. A noble disciple who has this may
declare of themselves: 'I've finished with rebirth in hell, the animal
realm, and the ghost realm. I've finished with all places of loss, bad
places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I'm not liable to be
reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.'"

### N 55.10 At the Brick Hall (3rd) *Tatiyagiñjakāvasathasutta*

Ānanda said to the Buddha:

"Sir, the layman named Kakkaṭa has passed away in
Ñātika. Where has he been reborn in his next life? The
laymen named Kaḷibha, Nikata, Kaṭissaha,
Tuṭṭha, Santuṭṭha, Bhadda, and Subhadda have
passed away in Ñātika. Where have they been reborn in the
next life?"

"Ānanda, the laymen Kakkaṭa, Kaḷibha, Nikata,
Kaṭissaha, Tuṭṭha, Santuṭṭha,
Bhadda, and Subhadda passed away having ended the five lower fetters.
They've been reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not
liable to return from that world.

Over fifty laymen in Ñātika have passed away having ended
the five lower fetters. They've been reborn spontaneously, and will be
extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.

More than ninety laymen in Ñātika have passed away having
ended three fetters, and weakened greed, hate, and delusion. They're
once-returners, who will come back to this world once only, then make an
end of suffering.

More than five hundred laymen in Ñātika have passed away
having ended three fetters. They're stream-enterers, not liable to be
reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.

It's no wonder that a human being should pass away. But if you should
come and ask me about it each and every time someone passes away, that
would be a bother for me. So Ānanda, I will teach you the explanation of
the Dhamma called 'the mirror of the teaching'. A noble disciple who has
this may declare of themselves: 'I've finished with rebirth in hell, the
animal realm, and the ghost realm. I've finished with all places of
loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I'm not liable
to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.'

And what is that mirror of the teaching?

It's when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha ...
the teaching ... the Saṅgha ... And they have the ethical
conduct loved by the noble ones ... leading to immersion. This is that
mirror of the teaching. A noble disciple who has this may declare of
themselves: 'I've finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and
the ghost realm. I've finished with all places of loss, bad places, the
underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I'm not liable to be reborn in the
underworld, and am bound for awakening.'"

## The Chapter on the Royal Monastery

### N 55.11 A Saṅgha of a Thousand Nuns *Sahassabhikkhunisaṁghasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the
Royal Monastery. Then a Saṅgha of a thousand nuns went up
to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. The Buddha said to them:

"Nuns, a noble disciple who has four things is a stream-enterer, not
liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. What four?
It's when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha ...
the teaching ... the Saṅgha ... And they have the ethical
conduct loved by the noble ones ... leading to immersion. A noble
disciple who has these four things is a stream-enterer, not liable to be
reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening."

### N 55.12 The Brahmins *Brāhmaṇasutta*

At Sāvatthī. "Mendicants, the brahmins advocate a practice
called 'get up and go'. They encourage their disciples: 'Please, good
people, rising early you should face east and walk. Do not avoid a pit,
a cliff, a stump, thorny ground, a swamp, or a sewer. You should await
death in the place that you fall. And when your body breaks up, after
death, you'll be reborn in a good place, a heaven realm.'

But this practice of the brahmins is a foolish procedure, a stupid
procedure. It doesn't lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation,
peace, insight, awakening, or extinguishment. But in the training of the
Noble One I advocate a 'get up and go' practice which does lead solely
to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening,
and extinguishment.

And what is that 'get up and go' practice? It's when a noble disciple
has experiential confidence in the Buddha ... the teaching ... the
Saṅgha ... And they have the ethical conduct loved by the
noble ones ... leading to immersion. This is that 'get up and go'
practice which does lead solely to disillusionment, dispassion,
cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment."

### N 55.13 With the Senior Monk Ānanda *Ānandattherasutta*

At one time the venerables Ānanda and Sāriputta were
staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove,
Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Then in the late afternoon,
Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable
Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite
conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him:

"Reverend, how many things do people have to give up and how many do
they have to possess in order for the Buddha to declare that they're a
stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for
awakening?"

"Reverend, people have to give up four things and possess four things in
order for the Buddha to declare that they're a stream-enterer, not
liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.

What four? They don't have the distrust in the Buddha that causes an
unlearned ordinary person to be reborn---when their body breaks up,
after death---in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. And
they do have the experiential confidence in the Buddha that causes a
learned noble disciple to be reborn---when their body breaks up, after
death---in a good place, a heavenly realm. 'That Blessed One is
perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and
conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to
train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.'

They don't have the distrust in the teaching that causes an unlearned
ordinary person to be reborn---when their body breaks up, after
death---in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. And they
do have the experiential confidence in the teaching that causes a
learned noble disciple to be reborn---when their body breaks up, after
death---in a good place, a heavenly realm. 'The teaching is well
explained by the Buddha---apparent in the present life, immediately
effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can
know it for themselves.'

They don't have the distrust in the Saṅgha that causes an
unlearned ordinary person to be reborn---when their body breaks up,
after death---in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. And
they do have the experiential confidence in the Saṅgha that
causes a learned noble disciple to be reborn---when their body breaks
up, after death---in a good place, a heavenly realm. 'The
Saṅgha of the Buddha's disciples is practicing the way
that's good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four
pairs, the eight individuals. This Saṅgha of the Buddha's
disciples is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of
hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, and worthy of veneration
with joined palms.'

They don't have the unethical conduct that causes an unlearned ordinary
person to be reborn---when their body breaks up, after death---in a
place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. And they do have the
ethical conduct loved by the noble ones that causes a learned noble
disciple to be reborn---when their body breaks up, after death---in a
good place, a heavenly realm. Their ethical conduct is loved by the
noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating,
praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion.
People have to give up these four things and possess these four things
in order for the Buddha to declare that they're a stream-enterer, not
liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening."

### N 55.14 Fear of the Bad Place *Duggatibhayasutta*

"Mendicants, a noble disciple who has four things has gone beyond all
fear of being reborn in a bad place. What four? It's when a noble
disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha ... the teaching ...
the Saṅgha ... And they have the ethical conduct loved by
the noble ones ... leading to immersion. A noble disciple who has these
four things has gone beyond all fear of being reborn in a bad place."

### N 55.16 Friends and Colleagues (1st) *Paṭhamamittāmaccasutta*

"Mendicants, those who you have sympathy for, and those worth listening
to---friends and colleagues, relatives and family---should be
encouraged, supported, and established in the four factors of
stream-entry. What four? Experiential confidence in the Buddha ... the
teaching ... the Saṅgha ... And the ethical conduct loved
by the noble ones ... leading to immersion. Those who you have sympathy
for, and those worth listening to---friends and colleagues, relatives
and family---should be encouraged, supported, and established in these
four factors of stream-entry."

stream-entry. What four? Experiential confidence in the Buddha ...

There might be change in the four principal states---the elements of
earth, water, fire, and air---but a noble disciple with experiential
confidence in the Buddha would never change. In this context, 'change'
means that such a noble disciple will be reborn in hell, the animal
realm, or the ghost realm: this is quite impossible.

Mahāmoggallāna, as easily as a strong person would extend

the gods of the thirty-three. Then several deities of the company of the

and stood to one side. Moggallāna said to them:

## The Chapter with Sarakāni

### N 55.21 With Mahānāma (1st) *Paṭhamamahānāmasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in the
land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.
Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat
down to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, this Kapilavatthu is successful and prosperous, populous, full of
people, with cramped cul-de-sacs. In the late afternoon, after paying
homage to the Buddha or an esteemed mendicant, I enter Kapilavatthu. I
encounter a stray elephant, horse, chariot, cart, or person. At that
time I lose mindfulness regarding the Buddha, the teaching, and the
Saṅgha. I think: 'If I were to die at this time, where
would I be reborn in my next life?'"

"Do not fear, Mahānāma, do not fear! Your death will not be
a bad one; your passing will not be a bad one. Take someone whose mind
has for a long time been imbued with faith, ethics, learning,
generosity, and wisdom. Their body is formed, made up of the four
principal states, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and
porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to
breaking up and destruction. Right here the crows, vultures, hawks,
dogs, jackals, and many kinds of little creatures devour it. But their
mind rises up, headed for a higher place.

Suppose a person was to sink a pot of ghee or oil into a deep lake and
break it open. Its shards and chips would sink down, while the ghee or
oil in it would rise up, headed for a higher place.

In the same way, take someone whose mind has for a long time been imbued
with faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom. Their body
consists of form, made up of the four principal states, produced by
mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to
impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and
destruction. Right here the crows, vultures, hawks, dogs, jackals, and
many kinds of little creatures devour it. But their mind rises up,
headed for a higher place.

Your mind, Mahānāma, has for a long time been imbued with
faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom. Do not fear,
Mahānāma, do not fear! Your death will not be a bad one;
your passing will not be a bad one."

### N 55.22 With Mahānāma (2nd) *Dutiyamahānāmasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in the
land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.
Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat
down to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, this Kapilavatthu is successful and prosperous, populous, full of
people, with cramped cul-de-sacs. In the late afternoon, after paying
homage to the Buddha or an esteemed mendicant, I enter Kapilavatthu. I
encounter a stray elephant, horse, chariot, cart, or person. At that
time I lose mindfulness regarding the Buddha, the teaching, and the
Saṅgha. I think: 'If I were to die at this time, where
would I be reborn in my next life?'"

"Do not fear, Mahānāma, do not fear! Your death will not be
a bad one; your passing will not be a bad one. A noble disciple who has
four things slants, slopes, and inclines towards extinguishment. What
four? It's when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the
Buddha ... the teaching ... the Saṅgha ... And they have
the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones ... leading to immersion.

Suppose there was a tree that slants, slopes, and inclines to the east.
If it was cut off at the root where would it fall?"

"Sir, it would fall in the direction that it slants, slopes, and
inclines."

"In the same way, a noble disciple who has four things slants, slopes,
and inclines towards extinguishment."

### N 55.23 With Godhā the Sakyan *Godhasakkasutta*

At Kapilavatthu. Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to
Godhā the Sakyan, and said to him, "Godhā, how
many things must a person have for you to recognize them as a
stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for
awakening?"

"Mahānāma, a person must have three things for me to
recognize them as a stream-enterer. What three? It's when a noble
disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha ... the teaching ...
and the Saṅgha ... When a person has these three things I
recognize them as a stream-enterer.

But Mahānāma, how many things must a person have for *you*
to recognize them as a stream-enterer?"

"Godhā, a person must have four things for me to recognize
them as a stream-enterer. What four? It's when a noble disciple has
experiential confidence in the Buddha ... the teaching ... the
Saṅgha ... And they have the ethical conduct loved by the
noble ones ... leading to immersion. When a person has these four things
I recognize them as a stream-enterer."

"Hold on, Mahānāma, hold on! Only the Buddha would know
whether or not they have these things."

"Come, Godhā, let's go to the Buddha and inform him about
this."

Then Mahānāma and Godhā went to the Buddha,
bowed, and sat down to one side. Mahānāma told the Buddha
all that had happened, and then said:

"Sir, some issue regarding the teaching might come up. The Buddha might
take one side, and the Saṅgha of monks the other. I'd side
with the Buddha. May the Buddha remember me as having such confidence.
Some issue regarding the teaching might come up. The Buddha might take
one side, and the Saṅgha of monks and the
Saṅgha of nuns the other. ... The Buddha might take one
side, and the Saṅgha of monks and the Saṅgha
of nuns and the laymen the other. ... The Buddha might take one side,
and the Saṅgha of monks and the Saṅgha of nuns
and the laymen and the laywomen the other. ... The Buddha might take one
side, and the Saṅgha of monks and the Saṅgha
of nuns and the laymen and the laywomen and the world---with its gods,
Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics
and brahmins, gods and humans---the other. I'd side with the Buddha. May
the Buddha remember me as having such confidence."

"Godhā, what do you have to say to Mahānāma
when he speaks like this?"

"Sir, I have nothing to say to Mahānāma when he speaks like
this, except what is good and wholesome."

### N 55.24 About Sarakāni (1st) *Paṭhamasaraṇānisakkasutta*

At Kapilavatthu.

Now at that time Sarakāni the Sakyan had passed away. The
Buddha declared that he was a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in
the underworld, bound for awakening.

At that, several Sakyans came together complaining, grumbling, and
objecting, "Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing! Who can't become a
stream-enterer these days? For the Buddha even declared
Sarakāni to be a stream-enterer after he passed away.
Sarakāni was too weak for the training; he used to drink
liquor."

Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat
down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said:

"Mahānāma, when a lay follower has for a long time gone for
refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, how
could they go to the underworld? And if anyone should rightly be said to
have for a long time gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and
the Saṅgha, it's Sarakāni the Sakyan.
Sarakāni the Sakyan has for a long time gone for refuge to
the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha. How could he go
to the underworld?

Take a certain person who has experiential confidence in the Buddha ...
the teaching ... the Saṅgha ... They have laughing wisdom
and swift wisdom, and are endowed with freedom. They've realized the
undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And
they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of
defilements. This person is exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the
ghost realm. They're exempt from places of loss, bad places, the
underworld.

Take another person who has experiential confidence in the Buddha ...
the teaching ... the Saṅgha ... They have laughing wisdom
and swift wisdom, but are not endowed with freedom. With the ending of
the five lower fetters they're reborn spontaneously. They are
extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. This
person, too, is exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm.
They're exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld.

Take another person who has experiential confidence in the Buddha ...
the teaching ... the Saṅgha ... But they don't have
laughing wisdom or swift wisdom, nor are they endowed with freedom. With
the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and
delusion, they're a once-returner. They come back to this world once
only, then make an end of suffering. This person, too, is exempt from
hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They're exempt from places
of loss, bad places, the underworld.

reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. This person, too, is
exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They're exempt
from places of loss, bad places, the underworld.

Take another person who doesn't have experiential confidence in the
Buddha ... the teaching ... the Saṅgha ... They don't have
laughing wisdom or swift wisdom, nor are they endowed with freedom.
Still, they have these qualities: the faculties of faith, energy,
mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. And they accept the teachings
proclaimed by the Realized One after deliberating them with a degree of
wisdom. This person, too, doesn't go to hell, the animal realm, and the
ghost realm. They don't go to places of loss, bad places, the
underworld.

If these great sal trees could understand what was well said and poorly
said, I'd declare them to be stream-enterers. Why can't this apply to
Sarakāni? Mahānāma, Sarakāni the
Sakyan undertook the training at the time of his death."

### N 55.25 About Sarakāni the Sakyan (2nd) *Dutiyasaraṇānisakkasutta*

At Kapilavatthu.

Now at that time Sarakāni the Sakyan had passed away. The
Buddha declared that he was a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in

objecting, "Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing! Who can't become a
stream-enterer these days? For the Buddha even declared
Sarakāni to be a stream-enterer after he passed away.
Sarakāni didn't fulfill the training."

Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat
down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said:

"Mahānāma, when a lay follower has for a long time gone for
refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, how

Sarakāni the Sakyan has for a long time gone for refuge to
the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.

Take a certain person who is sure and devoted to the Buddha ... the
teaching ... the Saṅgha ... They have laughing wisdom and
swift wisdom, and are endowed with freedom. They realize the undefiled
freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live
having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of

... they're extinguished upon landing ... they're extinguished without
extra effort ... they're extinguished with extra effort ... they head
upstream, going to the Akaniṭṭha realm. This person, too,
is exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They're
exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld.

Suppose there was a barren field, a barren ground, with uncleared
stumps. And you had seeds that were broken, spoiled, weather-damaged,
infertile, and ill kept. And the heavens didn't provide enough rain.
Would those seeds grow, increase, and mature?"

"No, sir."

"In the same way, take a teaching that's badly explained and badly
propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by
someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha. This is what I call a barren
field. A disciple remains in such a teaching, practicing in line with
that teaching, practicing it properly, living in line with that
teaching. This is what I call a bad seed.

Suppose there was a fertile field, a fertile ground, well-cleared of
stumps. And you had seeds that were intact, unspoiled, not
weather-damaged, fertile, and well-kept. And there's plenty of rainfall.
Would those seeds grow, increase, and mature?"

"Yes, sir."

"In the same way, take a teaching that's well explained and well

I call a good seed. Why can't this apply to Sarakāni?
Mahānāma, Sarakāni the Sakyan fulfilled the
training at the time of his death."

### N 55.26 Anāthapiṇḍika (1st) *Paṭhamaanāthapiṇḍikasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was sick,
suffering, gravely ill. Then he addressed a man, "Please, worthy man, go
to Venerable Sāriputta, and in my name bow with your head
to his feet. Say to him: 'Sir, the householder
Anāthapiṇḍika is sick, suffering, gravely ill. He bows with
his head to your feet.' And then say: 'Sir, please visit him at his home
out of sympathy.'"

"Yes, sir," that man replied. He did as Anāthapiṇḍika
asked. Sāriputta consented with silence.

Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and,
taking his bowl and robe, went with Venerable Ānanda as his second monk
to Anāthapiṇḍika's home. He sat down on the seat spread
out, and said to Anāthapiṇḍika, "I hope you're keeping
well, householder; I hope you're all right. And I hope the pain is
fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing."

"Sir, I'm not keeping well, I'm not getting by. The pain is terrible and
growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading."

"Householder, you don't have the distrust in the Buddha that causes an
unlearned ordinary person to be reborn---when their body breaks up,
after death---in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. And
you have experiential confidence in the Buddha: 'That Blessed One is
perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and
conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to
train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.' Seeing in
yourself that experiential confidence in the Buddha, that pain may die
down on the spot.

You don't have the distrust in the teaching that causes an unlearned
ordinary person to be reborn---when their body breaks up, after
death---in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. And you
have experiential confidence in the teaching: 'The teaching is well
explained by the Buddha---apparent in the present life, immediately
effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can
know it for themselves.' Seeing in yourself that experiential confidence
in the teaching, that pain may die down on the spot.

You don't have the distrust in the Saṅgha that causes an
unlearned ordinary person to be reborn---when their body breaks up,
after death---in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. And
you have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: 'The
Saṅgha of the Buddha's disciples is practicing the way
that's good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four
pairs, the eight individuals. This Saṅgha of the Buddha's
disciples is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of
hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, and worthy of veneration
with joined palms. It is the supreme field of merit for the world.'
Seeing in yourself that experiential confidence in the
Saṅgha, that pain may die down on the spot.

You don't have the unethical conduct that causes an unlearned ordinary
person to be reborn---when their body breaks up, after death---in a
place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. Your ethical conduct
is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and
unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and
leading to immersion. Seeing in yourself that ethical conduct loved by
the noble ones, that pain may die down on the spot.

You don't have the wrong view that causes an unlearned ordinary person
to be reborn---when their body breaks up, after death---in a place of
loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. You have right view. Seeing in
yourself that right view, that pain may die down on the spot.

You don't have the wrong thought ...

wrong speech ...

wrong action ...

wrong livelihood ...

wrong effort ...

wrong mindfulness ...

wrong immersion ...

wrong knowledge ...

wrong freedom ... You have right freedom. Seeing in yourself that right
freedom, that pain may die down on the spot."

And then Anāthapiṇḍika's pain died down on the spot. Then
he served Sāriputta and Ānanda from his own dish. When
Sāriputta had eaten and washed his hand and bowl,
Anāthapiṇḍika took a low seat and sat to one side.
Venerable Sāriputta expressed his appreciation to him with
these verses.

> "Whoever has faith in the Realized One,\
> unwavering and well grounded;\
> whose ethical conduct is good,\
> praised and loved by the noble ones;
>
> who has confidence in the Saṅgha,\
> and correct view:\
> they're said to be prosperous,\
> their life is not in vain.
>
> So let the wise devote themselves\
> to faith, ethical behaviour,\
> confidence, and insight into the teaching,\
> remembering the instructions of the Buddhas."

After expressing his appreciation to Anāthapiṇḍika with
these verses, Sāriputta got up from his seat and left.

Then Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The
Buddha said to him, "So, Ānanda, where are you coming from in the middle
of the day?"

"Sir, Venerable Sāriputta advised the householder
Anāthapiṇḍika in this way and that."

"Sāriputta is astute, Ānanda. He has great wisdom, since he
can analyze the four factors of stream-entry in ten respects."

### N 55.27 With Anāthapiṇḍika (2nd) *Dutiyaanāthapiṇḍikasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was sick,
suffering, gravely ill. Then he addressed a man, "Please, worthy man, go
to Venerable Ānanda, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say
to him: 'Sir, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika is sick,
suffering, gravely ill. He bows with his head to your feet.' And then
say: 'Sir, please visit him at his home out of sympathy.'"

"Yes, sir," that man replied. He did as Anāthapiṇḍika
asked. Ānanda consented with silence.

Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and
robe, went to the home of the householder Anāthapiṇḍika. He
sat down on the seat spread out and said to Anāthapiṇḍika,
"I hope you're keeping well, householder; I hope you're all right. And I
hope the pain is fading, not growing; that its fading, not its growing,
is apparent."

"Sir, I'm not keeping well, I'm not getting by. The pain is terrible and
growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading."

"Householder, when an unlearned ordinary person has four things, they're
frightened and terrified, and fear what awaits them after death. What
four? Firstly, an unlearned ordinary person distrusts the Buddha. Seeing
in themselves that distrust of the Buddha, they're frightened and
terrified, and fear what awaits them after death.

Furthermore, an unlearned ordinary person distrusts the teaching ...

Furthermore, an unlearned ordinary person distrusts the
Saṅgha ...

Furthermore, an unlearned ordinary person has unethical conduct. Seeing
in themselves that unethical conduct, they're frightened and terrified,
and fear what awaits them after death. When an unlearned ordinary person
has these four things, they're frightened and terrified, and fear what
awaits them after death.

When a learned noble disciple has four things, they're not frightened or
terrified, and don't fear what awaits them after death. What four?
Firstly, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha ...
Seeing in themselves that experiential confidence in the Buddha, they're
not frightened or terrified, and don't fear what awaits them after
death.

Furthermore, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the
teaching ...

Furthermore, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the
Saṅgha ...

Furthermore, a noble disciple's ethical conduct is loved by the noble
ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised
by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. Seeing in
themselves that ethical conduct loved by the noble ones, they're not
frightened or terrified, and don't fear what awaits them after death.

When a learned noble disciple has these four things, they're not
frightened or terrified, and don't fear what awaits them after death."

"Honorable Ānanda, I am not afraid. What have I to fear? For I have
experiential confidence in the Buddha ... the teaching ... the
Saṅgha ... And of the training rules appropriate for
laypeople taught by the Buddha, I don't see any that I have broken."

"You're fortunate, householder, so very fortunate! You have declared the
fruit of stream-entry."

### N 55.28 Dangers and Threats (1st) *Paṭhamabhayaverūpasantasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Seated to one side, the Buddha said to the householder
Anāthapiṇḍika:

"Householder, when a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and
threats, has the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and
comprehended the noble system with wisdom, they may, if they wish,
declare of themselves: 'I've finished with rebirth in hell, the animal
realm, and the ghost realm. I've finished with all places of loss, bad
places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I'm not liable to be
reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.'

What are the five dangers and threats they have quelled? Anyone who
kills living creatures creates dangers and threats both in this life and
in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. So that
danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from killing living
creatures. Anyone who steals ... Anyone who commits sexual misconduct
... Anyone who lies ... Anyone who consumes beer, wine, and liquor
intoxicants creates dangers and threats both in this life and in lives
to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. So that danger and
threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from beer, wine, and liquor
intoxicants. These are the five dangers and threats they have quelled.

What are the four factors of stream-entry that they have? It's when a
noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha ... the
teaching ... the Saṅgha ... And they have the ethical
conduct loved by the noble ones ... leading to immersion. These are the
four factors of stream-entry that they have.

And what is the noble system that they have clearly seen and
comprehended with wisdom? A noble disciple rationally applies the mind
to dependent origination itself: 'When this exists, that is; due to the
arising of this, that arises. When this doesn't exist, that is not; due
to the cessation of this, that ceases.' That is: Ignorance is a
condition for choices. Choices are a condition for consciousness.
Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are a
condition for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions
for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition
for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a
condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition
for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow,
lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. That is how this
entire mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and
ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease,
consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease.
When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. When the six sense
fields cease, contact ceases. When contact ceases, feeling ceases. When
feeling ceases, craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases.
When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued
existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and
death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease. That is
how this entire mass of suffering ceases. This is the noble system that
they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom.

When a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, has the four
factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble
system with wisdom, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves: 'I've
finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm.
I've finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am
a stream-enterer! I'm not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am
bound for awakening.'"

### N 55.29 Dangers and Threats (2nd) *Dutiyabhayaverūpasantasutta*

At Sāvatthī. ... "Mendicants, when a noble disciple has
quelled five dangers and threats, has the four factors of stream-entry,
and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble system with wisdom, they
may, if they wish, declare of themselves: 'I've finished with rebirth in
hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I've finished with all
places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I'm
not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.'"

### N 55.30 With Nandaka the Licchavi *Nandakalicchavisutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the
Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then Nandaka the Licchavi
chief minister went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to him:

"Nandaka, a noble disciple who has four things is a stream-enterer, not
liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. What four?
It's when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha ...
the teaching ... the Saṅgha ... And they have the ethical
conduct loved by the noble ones ... leading to immersion. A noble
disciple who has these four things is a stream-enterer, not liable to be
reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.

A noble disciple who has these four things is guaranteed long life, both
human and heavenly ... beauty ... happiness ... fame ... and
sovereignty, both human and heavenly. Now, I don't say this because I've
heard it from some other ascetic or brahmin. I only say it because I've
known, seen, and realized it for myself."

When he had spoken, a certain person said to Nandaka:

"Sir, it is time to bathe."

"Enough now, my man, with that exterior bath. This interior bathing will
do for me, that is, confidence in the Buddha."

and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete
ending of suffering. This is the fourth kind of overflowing merit,
overflowing goodness that nurtures happiness. These are the four kinds
of overflowing merit, overflowing goodness that nurture happiness."

### N 55.34 Footprints of the Gods (1st) *Paṭhamadevapadasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, these four footprints of the gods are in order to purify
unpurified beings and cleanse unclean beings.

Buddha ... This is the first footprint of the gods in order to purify
unpurified beings and cleanse unclean beings.

Furthermore, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the
teaching ... the Saṅgha ...

Furthermore, a noble disciple's ethical conduct is loved by the noble
ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised

Buddha: 'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha,
accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world,
supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans,
awakened, blessed.' Then they reflect: 'What now is the footprint of the
gods?' They understand: 'I hear that these days the gods consider
non-harming to be supreme. But I don't hurt any creature firm or frail.
I definitely live in possession of a footprint of the gods.' This is the
first footprint of the gods in order to purify unpurified beings and
cleanse unclean beings.

Furthermore, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the
teaching ... the Saṅgha ...

Furthermore, a noble disciple's ethical conduct is loved by the noble
ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised

### N 55.36 In Common With the Gods *Devasabhāgatasutta*

"Mendicants, when someone has four things the gods are pleased and speak
of what they have in common. What four? Firstly, a noble disciple has
experiential confidence in the Buddha ... There are deities with
experiential confidence in the Buddha who passed away from here and were
reborn there. They think: 'Having such experiential confidence in the
Buddha, we passed away from there and were reborn here. That noble
disciple has the same kind of experiential confidence in the Buddha, so
they will come into the presence of the gods.'

Furthermore, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the
teaching ... the Saṅgha ... And they have the ethical
conduct loved by the noble ones ... leading to immersion. There are

what they have in common."

### N 55.37 With Mahānāma *Mahānāmasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near
Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. Then Mahānāma
the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said
to him:

"Sir, how is a lay follower defined?"

"Mahānāma, when you've gone for refuge to the Buddha, the
teaching, and the Saṅgha, you're considered to be a lay
follower."

"But how is an ethical lay follower defined?"

"When a lay follower doesn't kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual
misconduct, lie, or consume beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants, they're
considered to be an ethical lay follower."

"But how is a faithful lay follower defined?"

"It's when a lay follower has faith in the Realized One's awakening:
'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in
knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for
those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.'
Then they're considered to be a faithful lay follower."

"But how is a generous lay follower defined?"

"It's when a lay follower lives at home rid of the stain of stinginess,
freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity,
loving to give and to share. Then they're considered to be a generous
lay follower."

"But how is a wise lay follower defined?"

"It's when a lay follower is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and
passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete
ending of suffering. Then they're considered to be a wise lay follower."

### N 55.38 Rain *Vassasutta*

"Mendicants, suppose the heavens rain heavily on a mountain top, and the
water flows downhill to fill the hollows, crevices, and creeks. As they
become full, they fill up the pools. The pools fill up the lakes, the
lakes fill up the streams, and the streams fill up the rivers. And as
the rivers become full, they fill up the ocean. In the same way, a noble
disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and
the Saṅgha, and the ethics loved by the noble ones. These
things flow onwards; and, after crossing to the far shore, they lead to
the ending of defilements."

### N 55.39 With Kāḷigodhā *Kāḷigodhasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near
Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. Then the Buddha robed up in
the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of
Kāḷigodhā the Sakyan lady, where he sat on the seat spread
out. Then Kāḷigodhā went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat
down to one side. The Buddha said to her:

"Godhā, a female noble disciple who has four things is a
stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for
awakening. What four? It's when a noble disciple has experiential
confidence in the Buddha ... the teaching ... the Saṅgha
... And they live at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely
generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to
give and to share. A female noble disciple who has these four things is
a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for
awakening."

"Sir, these four factors of stream-entry that were taught by the Buddha
are found in me, and I exhibit them. For I have experiential confidence
in the Buddha ... the teaching ... the Saṅgha ... And I
share without reservation all the gifts available to give in our family
with those who are ethical and of good character."

"You're fortunate, Godhā, so very fortunate, You have
declared the fruit of stream-entry."

### N 55.40 Nandiya the Sakyan *Nandiyasakkasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near
Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. Then Nandiya the Sakyan went
up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, if a noble disciple were to totally and utterly lack the four
factors of stream-entry, would they live negligently?"

"Nandiya, someone who totally and utterly lacks these four factors of
stream-entry is an outsider who belongs with the ordinary persons, I
say. Neverthless, Nandiya, as to how a noble disciple lives negligently
and how they live diligently, listen and apply your mind well, I will
speak."

"Yes, sir," Nandiya replied. The Buddha said this:

"And how does a noble disciple live negligently? Firstly, a noble
disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha ... They're content
with that confidence, and don't make a further effort for solitude by
day or retreat by night. When they live negligently, there's no joy.
When there's no joy, there's no rapture. When there's no rapture,
there's no tranquility. When there's no tranquility, there's suffering.
When one is suffering, the mind does not become immersed in
samādhi. When the mind is not immersed in
samādhi, principles do not become clear. Because principles
have not become clear, they're reckoned to live negligently.

Furthermore, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the
teaching ... the Saṅgha ... And they have the ethical
conduct loved by the noble ones ... leading to immersion. They're
content with that ethical conduct loved by the noble ones, and don't
make a further effort for solitude by day or retreat by night. When they
live negligently, there's no joy. When there's no joy, there's no
rapture. When there's no rapture, there's no tranquility. When there's
no tranquility, there's suffering. When one is suffering, the mind does
not become immersed in samādhi. When the mind is not
immersed in samādhi, principles do not become clear.
Because principles have not become clear, they're reckoned to live
negligently. That's how a noble disciple lives negligently.

And how does a noble disciple live diligently? Firstly, a noble disciple
has experiential confidence in the Buddha ... But they're not content
with that confidence, and make a further effort for solitude by day and
retreat by night. When they live diligently, joy springs up. Being
joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body
becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when
blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi. When the
mind is immersed in samādhi, principles become clear.
Because principles have become clear, they're reckoned to live
diligently.

Furthermore, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the
teaching ... the Saṅgha ... And they have the ethical
conduct loved by the noble ones ... leading to immersion. But they're
not content with that ethical conduct loved by the noble ones, and make
a further effort for solitude by day and retreat by night. When they
live diligently, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When
the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is
tranquil, they feel bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed
in samādhi. When the mind is immersed in
samādhi, principles become clear. Because principles have
become clear, they're reckoned to live diligently. That's how a noble
disciple lives diligently."

## The Chapter on Overflowing Merit, With Verses

### N 55.41 Overflowing Merit (1st) *Paṭhamaabhisandasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these four kinds of overflowing merit,
overflowing goodness that nurture happiness. What four? It's when a
noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha ... the
teaching ... the Saṅgha ...

Furthermore, they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones ...
leading to immersion. ... These are the four kinds of overflowing merit,
overflowing goodness that nurture happiness.

When a noble disciple has these four kinds of overflowing merit and
goodness, it's not easy to measure how much merit they have by saying
that this is the extent of their overflowing merit, overflowing goodness
that nurtures happiness. It's simply reckoned as an incalculable,
immeasurable, great mass of merit.

It's like trying to measure how much water is in the ocean. It's not
easy to say how many gallons, how many hundreds, thousands, hundreds of
thousands of gallons there are. It's simply reckoned as an incalculable,
immeasurable, great mass of water.

In the same way, when a noble disciple has these four kinds of
overflowing merit and goodness, it's not easy to measure how much merit
they have by saying that this is the extent of their overflowing merit,

incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "Hosts of people use the rivers,\

>
> So too, when a person gives food, drink, and clothes;\
> and they're a giver of beds, seats, and mats---\

There are places where the great rivers---the Ganges, Yamuna,
Aciravatī, Sarabhū, and
Mahī---come together and converge. It's not easy to measure
how much water is in such places by saying how many gallons, how many
hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands of gallons there are. It's
simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of water.

### N 55.52 One Who Completed the Rains *Vassaṁvutthasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Now at that time a
certain mendicant who had completed the rainy season residence in
Sāvatthī arrived at Kapilavatthu on some business. The
Sakyans of Kapilavatthu heard about this.

They went to that mendicant, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to
him, "Sir, we hope that the Buddha is healthy and strong."

"He is, good fellows."

"And we hope that Sāriputta and Moggallāna are
healthy and strong."

"They are."

"And we hope that the mendicant Saṅgha is healthy and
strong."

"It is."

"But sir, during this rains residence did you hear and learn anything in
the presence of the Buddha?"

"Good fellows, I heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
'There are fewer mendicants who realize the undefiled freedom of heart
and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it
with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. There are more
mendicants who, having ended the five lower fetters, are reborn
spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from
that world.'

In addition, I heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
'There are fewer mendicants who, having ended the five lower fetters,
are reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to
return from that world. There are more mendicants who, with the ending
of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, are
once-returners, who come back to this world once only, then make an end
of suffering.'

In addition, I heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
'There are fewer mendicants who, with the ending of three fetters, and
the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, are once-returners, who come
back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. There are
more mendicants who, with the ending of three fetters are
stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for
awakening.'"

### N 55.53 With Dhammadinna *Dhammadinnasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Varanasi, in the deer park at
Isipatana. Then the lay follower Dhammadinna, together with five hundred
lay followers, went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and
said to him:

"May the Buddha please advise and instruct us. It will be for our
lasting welfare and happiness."

"So, Dhammadinna, you should train like this: 'From time to time we will
undertake and dwell upon the discourses spoken by the Realized One that
are deep, profound, transcendent, dealing with emptiness.' That's how
you should train yourselves."

"Sir, we live at home with our children, using sandalwood imported from
Kāsi, wearing garlands, fragrance, and makeup, and
accepting gold and currency. It's not easy for us to undertake and dwell
from time to time upon the discourses spoken by the Realized One that
are deep, profound, transcendent, dealing with emptiness. Since we are
established in the five training rules, please teach us further."

"So, Dhammadinna, you should train like this: 'We will have experiential
confidence in the Buddha ... the teaching ... the Saṅgha
... And we will have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones ...
leading to immersion.' That's how you should train yourselves."

"Sir, these four factors of stream-entry that were taught by the Buddha
are found in us, and we embody them. For we have experiential confidence
in the Buddha ... the teaching ... the Saṅgha ... And we
have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones ... leading to
immersion."

"You're fortunate, Dhammadinna, so very fortunate! You have all declared
the fruit of stream-entry."

### N 55.54 Sick *Gilānasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near
Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.

At that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha,
thinking that when his robe was finished and the three months of the
rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering.

Mahānāma the Sakyan heard about this. Then he went up to
the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him that he had heard
that the Buddha was leaving. He added, "Sir, I haven't heard and learned
it in the presence of the Buddha how a wise lay follower should advise
another wise lay follower who is sick, suffering, gravely ill."

"Mahānāma, a wise lay follower should put at ease another
wise lay follower who is sick, suffering, gravely ill with four
consolations. 'Be at ease, sir. You have experiential confidence in the
Buddha ... the teaching ... the Saṅgha ... And you have the
ethical conduct loved by the noble ones ... leading to immersion.'

When a wise lay follower has put at ease another wise lay follower who
is sick, suffering, gravely ill with these four consolations, they
should say: 'Are you concerned for your mother and father?' If they
reply, 'I am,' they should say: 'But sir, it's your nature to die.
Whether or not you are concerned for your mother and father, you will
die anyway. It would be good to give up concern for your mother and
father.'

If they reply, 'I have given up concern for my mother and father,' they
should say: 'But are you concerned for your partners and children?' If
they reply, 'I am,' they should say: 'But sir, it's your nature to die.
Whether or not you are concerned for your partners and children, you
will die anyway. It would be good to give up concern for your partners
and children.'

If they reply, 'I have given up concern for my partners and children,'
they should say: 'But are you concerned for the five kinds of human
sensual stimulation?' If they reply, 'I am,' they should say: 'Good
fellow, heavenly sensual pleasures are better than human sensual
pleasures. It would be good to turn your mind away from human sensual
pleasures and fix it on the gods of the four great kings.'

If they reply, 'I have done so,' they should say: 'Good fellow, the gods
of the thirty-three are better than the gods of the four great kings ...

Good fellow, the gods of Yama ... the joyful gods ... the gods who love
to imagine ... the gods who control what is imagined by others ... the
gods of the realm of divinity are better than the gods who control what
is imagined by others. It would be good to turn your mind away from the
gods who control what is imagined by others and fix it on the gods of
the realm of divinity.' If they reply, 'I have done so,' they should
say: 'Good fellow, the realm of divinity is impermanent, not lasting,
and included within substantial reality. It would be good to turn your
mind away from the realm of divinity and apply it to the cessation of
substantial reality.'

If they reply, 'I have done so,' then there is no difference between a
lay follower whose mind is freed in this way and a mendicant whose mind
is freed from defilements; that is, between the freedom of one and the
other."
