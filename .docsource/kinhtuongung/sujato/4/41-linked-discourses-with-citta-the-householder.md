# Linked Discourses with Citta the Householder

## The Chapter with Citta

### N 41.1 The Fetter *Saṁyojanasutta*

At one time several senior mendicants were staying near
Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove. Now at that time,
after the meal, on return from almsround, several senior mendicants sat
together in the pavilion and this discussion came up among them:

"Reverends, the 'fetter' and the 'things prone to being fettered': do
these things differ in both meaning and phrasing? Or do they mean the
same thing, and differ only in the phrasing?"

Some senior mendicants answered like this: "Reverends, the 'fetter' and
the 'things prone to being fettered': these things differ in both
meaning and phrasing."

But some senior mendicants answered like this: "Reverends, the 'fetter'
and the 'things prone to being fettered' mean the same thing; they
differ only in the phrasing."

Now at that time the householder Citta had arrived at Migapathaka on
some business. He heard about what those senior mendicants were
discussing.

So he went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to them,
"Sirs, I heard that you were discussing whether the 'fetter' and the
'things prone to being fettered' differ in both meaning and phrasing, or
whether they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing."

"That's right, householder."

"Sirs, the 'fetter' and the 'things prone to being fettered': these
things differ in both meaning and phrasing.

Well then, sirs, I shall give you a simile. For by means of a simile
some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said.

Suppose there was a black ox and a white ox yoked by a single harness or
yoke. Would it be right to say that the black ox is the yoke of the
white ox, or the white ox is the yoke of the black ox?"

"No, householder. The black ox is not the yoke of the white ox, nor is
the white ox the yoke of the black ox. The yoke there is the single
harness or yoke that they're yoked by."

"In the same way, the eye is not the fetter of sights, nor are sights
the fetter of the eye. The fetter there is the desire and greed that
arises from the pair of them.

The ear ... nose ... tongue ... body ... mind is not the fetter of
ideas, nor are ideas the fetter of the mind. The fetter there is the
desire and greed that arises from the pair of them."

"You're fortunate, householder, so very fortunate, to traverse the
Buddha's deep teachings with the eye of wisdom."

### N 41.2 Isidatta (1st) *Paṭhamaisidattasutta*

At one time several senior mendicants were staying near
Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove.

Then Citta the householder went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side,
and said to them, "Honorable Seniors, please accept my offering of
tomorrow's meal."

They consented with silence. Knowing that the senior mendicants had
consented, Citta got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled
them, keeping them on his right, before leaving.

Then when the night had passed, the senior mendicants robed up in the
morning and, taking their bowls and robes, went to Citta's home, and sat
down on the seats spread out.

Then Citta went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side, and asked the
senior venerable, "Honorable Senior, they speak of 'the diversity of
elements'. In what way did the Buddha speak of the diversity of
elements?"

When he said this, the venerable senior kept silent.

For a second time ...

And for a third time, Citta asked him, "Honorable Senior, they speak of
'the diversity of elements'. In what way did the Buddha speak of the
diversity of elements?"

And a second time and a third time the senior venerable kept silent.

Now at that time Venerable Isidatta was the most junior mendicant in
that Saṅgha. He said to the senior venerable, "Honorable
Senior, may I answer Citta's question?"

"Answer it, Reverend Isidatta."

"Householder, is this your question: 'They speak of "the diversity of
elements". In what way did the Buddha speak of the diversity of
elements?'"

"Yes, sir."

"This is the diversity of elements spoken of by the Buddha.

The eye element, the sights element, the eye consciousness element ...

The mind element, the idea element, the mind consciousness element.

This is how the Buddha spoke of the diversity of elements."

Then Citta, having approved and agreed with what Isidatta said, served
and satisfied the senior mendicants with his own hands with delicious
fresh and cooked foods. When the senior mendicants had eaten and washed
their hands and bowls, they got up from their seats and left.

Then the senior venerable said to Venerable Isidatta, "Isidatta, it's
good that you felt inspired to answer that question, because I didn't.
So when a similar question comes up, you should also answer it as you
feel inspired."

### N 41.3 With Isidatta (2nd) *Dutiyaisidattasutta*

At one time several senior mendicants were staying near
Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove.

Then Citta the householder went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side,
and said to them, "Honorable Seniors, please accept my offering of
tomorrow's meal."

They consented with silence. Then, knowing that the senior mendicants
had consented, Citta got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully
circled them, keeping them on his right, before leaving.

Then when the night had passed, the senior mendicants robed up in the
morning and, taking their bowls and robes, went to Citta's home, and sat
down on the seats spread out.

So he went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the
senior venerable:

"Honorable Senior, there are many different views that arise in the
world. For example: the cosmos is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or
infinite; the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are
different things; after death, a realized one still exists, or no longer
exists, or both still exists and no longer exists, or neither still
exists nor no longer exists. And also the sixty-two misconceptions
spoken of in "The Divine Net". When what exists do these views come to
be? When what doesn't exist do these views not come to be?"

When he said this, the venerable senior kept silent.

For a second time ...

And for a third time, Citta said to him:

"Honorable Senior, there are many different views that arise in the
world. ... When what exists do these views come to be? When what doesn't
exist do these views not come to be?"

And a second time and a third time the senior venerable kept silent.

Now at that time Venerable Isidatta was the most junior mendicant in
that Saṅgha. He said to the venerable senior, "Honorable
Senior, may I answer Citta's question?"

"Answer it, Reverend Isidatta."

"Householder, is this your question: 'There are many different views
that arise in the world ... When what exists do these views come to be?
When what doesn't exist do these views not come to be?'" "Yes, sir."

"Householder, there are many different views that arise in the world.
For example: the cosmos is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or
infinite; the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are
different things; after death, a realized one still exists, or no longer
exists, or both still exists and no longer exists, or neither still
exists nor no longer exists. And also the sixty-two misconceptions
spoken of in "The Divine Net".

These views come to be when substantialist view exists. When
substantialist view does not exist they do not come to be."

"But sir, how does substantialist view come about?"

"It's when an unlearned ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and
is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones.
They've not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in
the teaching of the true persons.

They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in
form. They regard feeling ... perception ... choices ... consciousness
as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in
consciousness.

That's how substantialist view comes about."

"But sir, how does substantialist view not come about?"

"It's when a learned noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is
skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They've seen true
persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the true
persons.

They don't regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or
self in form. They don't regard feeling ... perception ... choices ...
consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in
self, or self in consciousness.

That's how substantialist view does not come about."

"Sir, where has Master Isidatta come from?"

"I come from Avanti, householder."

"Sir, there's a friend of mine called Isidatta who I've never met. He's
gone forth from a good family in Avanti. Have you met him?"

"Yes, householder."

"Sir, where is that venerable now staying?" When he said this, Isidatta
kept silent.

"Sir, are you that Isidatta?"

"Yes, householder."

"Sir, I hope Master Isidatta is happy here in
Macchikāsaṇḍa, for the Wild Mango Grove is lovely. I'll
make sure that Master Isidatta is provided with robes, almsfood,
lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick."

"That's nice of you to say, householder."

Then Citta, having approved and agreed with what Isidatta said, served
and satisfied the senior mendicants with his own hands with delicious
fresh and cooked foods. When the senior mendicants had eaten and washed
their hands and bowls, they got up from their seats and left.

Then the venerable senior said to Venerable Isidatta, "Isidatta, it's
good that you felt inspired to answer that question, because I didn't.
So when a similar question comes up, you should also answer it as you
feel inspired."

But Isidatta set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe,
left Macchikāsaṇḍa, never to return.

### N 41.4 Mahaka's Demonstration *Mahakapāṭihāriyasutta*

At one time several senior mendicants were staying near
Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove.

Then Citta the householder went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side,
and said to them, "Honorable Seniors, please accept my offering of
tomorrow's meal in my barn."

They consented with silence. Then, knowing that the senior mendicants
had consented, Citta got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully
circled them, keeping them on his right, before leaving.

Then when the night had passed, the senior mendicants robed up in the
morning and, taking their bowls and robes, went to Citta's barn, and sat
down on the seats spread out.

Then Citta served and satisfied the senior mendicants with his own hands
with delicious milk-rice made with ghee. When the senior mendicants had
eaten and washed their hands and bowls, they got up from their seats and
left. Citta instructed that the remainder of the food be distributed,
then followed behind the senior mendicants.

Now at that time the heat was sweltering. And those senior mendicants
walked along as if their bodies were melting, as happens after a meal.

Now at that time Venerable Mahaka was the most junior mendicant in that
Saṅgha. Then Venerable Mahaka said to the senior venerable,
"Wouldn't it be nice, Honorable Senior, if a cool wind blew, a cloud
canopy formed, and a gentle rain drizzled down?"

"It would indeed be nice, Reverend Mahaka." Then Mahaka used his psychic
power to will that a cool wind would blow, a cloud canopy would form,
and a gentle rain would drizzle down.

Then Citta thought, "The most junior mendicant in this
Saṅgha has such psychic power!"

When they reached the monastery, Mahaka said to the senior venerable,
"Honorable Senior, is that sufficient?"

"That's sufficient, Reverend Mahaka, you've done enough and offered
enough." Then the senior mendicants entered their dwellings, and Mahaka
entered his own dwelling.

Then Citta went up to Mahaka, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to
him, "Sir, please show me a superhuman demonstration of psychic power."

"Well, then, householder, place your upper robe on the porch and spread
a handful of grass on it."

"Yes, sir," replied Citta, and did as he was asked.

Mahaka entered his dwelling and latched the door. Then he used his
psychic power to will that a flame shoot out through the keyhole and the
chink in the door-panel, and it burned up the grass but not the upper
robe. Then Citta shook out his upper robe and stood to one side, shocked
and awestruck.

Mahaka left his dwelling and said to Citta, "Is that sufficient,
householder?"

"That's sufficient, sir, you've done enough and offered enough. I hope
Master Mahaka is happy here in Macchikāsaṇḍa, for the Wild
Mango Grove is lovely. I'll make sure that Master Mahaka is provided
with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the
sick."

"That's nice of you to say, householder."

But Mahaka set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, left
Macchikāsaṇḍa, never to return.

### N 41.5 With Kāmabhū (1st) *Paṭhamakāmabhūsutta*

At one time Venerable Kāmabhū was staying near
Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove.

Then Citta the householder went up to Venerable Kāmabhū,
bowed, and sat down to one side. Kāmabhū said to him,
"Householder, there is this saying:

> 'With flawless wheel and white canopy,\
> the one-spoke chariot rolls on.\
> See it come, untroubled,\
> with stream cut, unbound.'

How should we see the detailed meaning of this brief statement?"

"Sir, was this spoken by the Buddha?"

"Yes, householder."

"Well then, sir, please wait a while while I consider the meaning of
this." Then after staying silent for a while, Citta said to
Kāmabhū:

"Sir, 'flawless wheel' is a term for ethics.

'White canopy' is a term for freedom.

'One spoke' is a term for mindfulness.

'Rolls on' is a term for going forward and coming back.

'Chariot' is a term for this body made up of the four principal states,
produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable
to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and
destruction.

Greed, hate, and delusion are troubles. A mendicant who has ended the
defilements has given these up, cut them off at the root, made them like
a palm stump, and obliterated them, so they are unable to arise in the
future. That's why a mendicant who has ended the defilements is called
'untroubled'.

'The one who comes' is a term for the perfected one.

'Stream' is a term for craving. A mendicant who has ended the
defilements has given this up, cut it off at the root, made it like a
palm stump, and obliterated it, so it's unable to arise in the future.
That's why a mendicant who has ended the defilements is said to have
'cut the stream'.

Greed, hate, and delusion are bonds. A mendicant who has ended the
defilements has given these up, cut them off at the root, made them like
a palm stump, and obliterated them, so they are unable to arise in the
future. That's why a mendicant who has ended the defilements is called
'unbound'.

So, sir, that's how I understand the detailed meaning of what the Buddha
said in brief:

> 'With flawless wheel and white canopy,\
> the one-spoke chariot rolls on.\
> See it come, untroubled,\
> with stream cut, unbound.'"

"You're fortunate, householder, so very fortunate, to traverse the
Buddha's deep teachings with the eye of wisdom."

### N 41.6 With Kāmabhū (2nd) *Dutiyakāmabhūsutta*

At one time Venerable Kāmabhū was staying near
Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove. Then Citta the
householder went up to Venerable Kāmabhū, sat down to one
side, and said to him:

"Sir, how many processes are there?"

"Householder, there are three processes. Physical, verbal, and mental
processes."

Saying "Good, sir," Citta approved and agreed with what
Kāmabhū said. Then he asked another question:

"But sir, what is the physical process? What's the verbal process?
What's the mental process?"

"Breathing is a physical process. Placing the mind and keeping it
connected are verbal processes. Perception and feeling are mental
processes."

Saying "Good, sir," he asked another question:

"But sir, why is breathing a physical process? Why are placing the mind
and keeping it connected verbal processes? Why are perception and
feeling mental processes?"

"Breathing is physical. It's tied up with the body, that's why breathing
is a physical process. First you place the mind and keep it connected,
then you break into speech. That's why placing the mind and keeping it
connected are verbal processes. Perception and feeling are mental.
They're tied up with the mind, that's why perception and feeling are
mental processes."

Saying "Good, sir," he asked another question:

"But sir, how does someone attain the cessation of perception and
feeling?"

"A mendicant who is entering such an attainment does not think: 'I will
enter the cessation of perception and feeling' or 'I am entering the
cessation of perception and feeling' or 'I have entered the cessation of
perception and feeling.' Rather, their mind has been previously
developed so as to lead to such a state."

Saying "Good, sir," he asked another question:

"But sir, which cease first for a mendicant who is entering the
cessation of perception and feeling: physical, verbal, or mental
processes?"

"Verbal processes cease first, then physical, then mental."

Saying "Good, sir," he asked another question:

"What's the difference between someone who has passed away and a
mendicant who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling?"

"When someone dies, their physical, verbal, and mental processes have
ceased and stilled; their vitality is spent; their warmth is dissipated;
and their faculties have disintegrated. When a mendicant has attained
the cessation of perception and feeling, their physical, verbal, and
mental processes have ceased and stilled. But their vitality is not
spent; their warmth is not dissipated; and their faculties are very
clear. That's the difference between someone who has passed away and a
mendicant who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling."

Saying "Good, sir," he asked another question:

"But sir, how does someone emerge from the cessation of perception and
feeling?"

"A mendicant who is emerging from such an attainment does not think: 'I
will emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling' or 'I am
emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling' or 'I have
emerged from the cessation of perception and feeling.' Rather, their
mind has been previously developed so as to lead to such a state."

Saying "Good, sir," he asked another question:

"But sir, which arise first for a mendicant who is emerging from the
cessation of perception and feeling: physical, verbal, or mental
processes?"

"Mental processes arise first, then physical, then verbal."

Saying "Good, sir," he asked another question:

"But sir, when a mendicant has emerged from the attainment of the
cessation of perception and feeling, how many kinds of contact do they
experience?"

"They experience three kinds of contact: emptiness, signless, and
undirected contacts."

Saying "Good, sir," he asked another question:

"But sir, when a mendicant has emerged from the attainment of the
cessation of perception and feeling, what does their mind slant, slope,
and incline to?"

"Their mind slants, slopes, and inclines to seclusion."

Saying "Good, sir," Citta approved and agreed with what
Kāmabhū said. Then he asked another question:

"But sir, how many things are helpful for attaining the cessation of
perception and feeling?"

"Well, householder, you've finally asked what you should have asked
first! Nevertheless, I will answer you. Two things are helpful for
attaining the cessation of perception and feeling: serenity and
discernment."

### N 41.7 With Godatta *Godattasutta*

At one time Venerable Godatta was staying near
Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove. Then Citta the
householder went up to Venerable Godatta, bowed, and sat down to one
side. Godatta said to him:

"Householder, the limitless release of the heart, and the release of the
heart through nothingness, and the release of the heart through
emptiness, and the signless release of the heart: do these things differ
in both meaning and phrasing? Or do they mean the same thing, and differ
only in the phrasing?"

"Sir, there is a way in which these things differ in both meaning and
phrasing. But there's also a way in which they mean the same thing, and
differ only in the phrasing.

And what's the way in which these things differ in both meaning and
phrasing?

It's when a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one
direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In
the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a
heart full of love to the whole world---abundant, expansive, limitless,
free of enmity and ill will. They meditate spreading a heart full of
compassion ... They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing ...
They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and
to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way
above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full
of equanimity to the whole world---abundant, expansive, limitless, free
of enmity and ill will. This is called the limitless release of the
heart.

And what is the release of the heart through nothingness? It's when a
mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness,
aware that 'there is nothing at all', enters and remains in the
dimension of nothingness. This is called the release of the heart
through nothingness.

And what is the release of the heart through emptiness? It's when a
mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an
empty hut, and reflects like this: 'This is empty of a self or what
belongs to a self.' This is called the release of the heart through
emptiness.

And what is the signless heart's release? It's when a mendicant, not
focusing on any signs, enters and remains in the signless immersion of
the heart. This is called the signless release of the heart.

This is the way in which these things differ in both meaning and
phrasing.

And what's the way in which they mean the same thing, and differ only in
the phrasing?

Greed, hate, and delusion are makers of limits. A mendicant who has
ended the defilements has given these up, cut them off at the root, made
them like a palm stump, and obliterated them, so they are unable to
arise in the future. The unshakable release of the heart is said to be
the best kind of limitless release of the heart. That unshakable release
of the heart is empty of greed, hate, and delusion.

Greed is something, hate is something, and delusion is something. A
mendicant who has ended the defilements has given these up, cut them off
at the root, made them like a palm stump, and obliterated them, so they
are unable to arise in the future. The unshakable release of the heart
is said to be the best kind of release of the heart through nothingness.
That unshakable release of the heart is empty of greed, hate, and
delusion.

Greed, hate, and delusion are makers of signs. A mendicant who has ended
the defilements has given these up, cut them off at the root, made them
like a palm stump, and obliterated them, so they are unable to arise in
the future. The unshakable release of the heart is said to be the best
kind of signless release of the heart. That unshakable release of the
heart is empty of greed, hate, and delusion.

This is the way in which they mean the same thing, and differ only in
the phrasing."

"You're fortunate, householder, so very fortunate, to traverse the
Buddha's deep teachings with the eye of wisdom."

### N 41.8 The Jain Ascetic of the Ñātika Clan *Nigaṇṭhanāṭaputtasutta*

Now at that time the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan had
arrived at Macchikāsaṇḍa together with a large assembly of
Jain ascetics.

Citta the householder heard that they had arrived. Together with several
lay followers, he went up to the Jain Ñātika and exchanged
greetings with him.

When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one
side. The Jain Ñātika said to him, "Householder, do you
have faith in the ascetic Gotama's claim that there is a state of
immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected; that there
is the cessation of placing the mind and keeping it connected?"

"Sir, in this case I don't rely on faith in the Buddha's claim that
there is a state of immersion without placing the mind and keeping it
connected; that there is the cessation of placing the mind and keeping
it connected."

When he said this, the Jain Ñātika looked up at his
assembly and said, "See, good fellows, how straightforward this
householder Citta is! He's not devious or deceitful at all. To imagine
that you can stop placing the mind and keeping it connected would be
like imagining that you can catch the wind in a net, or dam the Ganges
river with your own hand."

"What do you think, sir? Which is better---knowledge or faith?"

"Knowledge is definitely better than faith, householder."

"Well sir, whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first
absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while
placing the mind and keeping it connected. And whenever I want, as the
placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled ... I enter and
remain in the second absorption. And whenever I want, with the fading
away of rapture ... I enter and remain in the third absorption. And
whenever I want, giving up pleasure and pain ... I enter and remain in
the fourth absorption.

And so, sir, since I know and see like this, why should I rely on faith
in another ascetic or brahmin who claims that there is a state of
immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected; that there
is the cessation of placing the mind and keeping it connected?"

When he said this, the Jain Ñātika looked askance at his
own assembly and said, "See, good fellows, how crooked this householder
Citta is! He's so devious and deceitful!"

"Sir, just now I understood you to say: 'See, good fellows, how
straightforward this householder Citta is! He's not devious or deceitful
at all.' But then I understood you to say: 'See, good fellows, how
crooked this householder Citta is! He's so devious and deceitful!' If
your first statement is true, the second is wrong. If your first
statement is wrong, the second is true.

And also, sir, these ten legitimate questions are relevant. When you
understand what they mean, then, together with your assembly of Jain
ascetics, you can rebut me. 'One thing: question, summary, and answer.
Two ... three ... four ... five ... six ... seven ... eight ... nine ...
ten things: question, summary, and answer.'"

Then Citta got up from his seat and left without asking the Jain
Ñātika these ten legitimate questions.

### N 41.9 With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic *Acelakassapasutta*

Now at that time the naked ascetic Kassapa, an old friend of Citta in
the lay life, had arrived at Macchikāsaṇḍa.

Citta the householder heard that he had arrived. So he went up to him,
and they exchanged greetings.

When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one
side and said to the naked ascetic Kassapa, "Honorable Kassapa, how long
has it been since you went forth?"

"It's been thirty years, householder."

"But sir, in these thirty years have you achieved any superhuman
distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a
comfortable meditation?"

"I have no such achievement, householder, only nakedness, baldness, and
pokes in the buttocks."

Citta said to him, "Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing, how well
explained the teaching is. For in thirty years you have achieved no
superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones,
no comfortable meditation, only nakedness, baldness, and pokes in the
buttocks."

"But householder, how long have you been a lay follower?"

"It's been thirty years, sir."

"But householder, in these thirty years have you achieved any superhuman
distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a
comfortable meditation?"

"How, sir, could I not? For whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual
pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the
first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion,
while placing the mind and keeping it connected. And whenever I want, as
the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled ... I enter
and remain in the second absorption. And whenever I want, with the
fading away of rapture ... I enter and remain in the third absorption.
And whenever I want, giving up pleasure and pain ... I enter and remain
in the fourth absorption.

If I pass away before the Buddha, it would be no wonder if the Buddha
declares of me: 'The householder Citta is bound by no fetter that might
return him to this world.'"

When this was said, Kassapa said to Citta, "Oh lord, how incredible, how
amazing, how well explained the teaching is. For a white-clothed
layperson can achieve such a superhuman distinction in knowledge and
vision worthy of the noble ones, a comfortable meditation. Householder,
may I receive the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and
training?"

Then Citta the householder took the naked ascetic Kassapa to see the
senior mendicants, and said to them:

"Sirs, this is the naked ascetic Kassapa, who in lay life was an old
friend of mine. May the senior monks give him the going forth, the
ordination. I'll make sure that he's provided with robes, almsfood,
lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick."

And the naked ascetic Kassapa received the going forth, the ordination
in this teaching and training. Not long after his ordination, Venerable
Kassapa, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon
realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He
lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen
rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.

He understood: "Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been
completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further
for this place." And Venerable Kassapa became one of the perfected.

### N 41.10 Seeing the Sick *Gilānadassanasutta*

Now at that time the householder Citta was sick, suffering, gravely ill.

Then several deities of the parks, forests, trees, and those who haunt
the herbs, grass, and big trees came together and said to Citta,
"Householder, make a wish to become a wheel-turning monarch in the
future!"

When they said this, Citta said to them, "That too is impermanent! That
too will pass! That too will be left behind!"

When he said this, his friends and colleagues, relatives and kin said,
"Be mindful, master! Don't babble."

"What have I said that makes you say that?"

"It's because you said: 'That too is impermanent! That too will pass!
That too will be left behind!'"

"Oh, well, that's because the deities of the parks, forests, trees, and
those who haunt the herbs, grass, and big trees said to me:
'Householder, make a wish to become a wheel-turning monarch in the
future!' So I said to them: 'That too is impermanent! That too will
pass! That too will be left behind!'"

"But what reason do they see for saying that to you?"

"They think: 'This householder Citta is ethical, of good character. If
he makes a wish to become a wheel-turning monarch in the future, his
heart's wish will succeed because of the purity of his ethics. And then
as a proper, principled king he will provide proper spirit-offerings.'
That's the reason they see for saying to me: 'Householder, make a wish
to become a wheel-turning monarch in the future!' So I said to them:
'That too is impermanent! That too will pass! That too will be left
behind!'"

"Then, master, advise us!"

"So you should train like this:

We will have experiential confidence in the Buddha: 'That Blessed One is
perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and
conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to
train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.'

We will have experiential confidence in the teaching: 'The teaching is
well explained by the Buddha---apparent in the present life, immediately
effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can
know it for themselves.'

We will have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: 'The
Saṅgha of the Buddha's disciples is practicing the way
that's good, sincere, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four
pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the
Buddha's disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods,
worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of
greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the
world.'

And we will share without reservation all the gifts available to give in
our family with those who are ethical and of good character."

Then, after Citta had encouraged his friends and colleagues, relatives
and kin in the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, and
generosity, he passed away.
