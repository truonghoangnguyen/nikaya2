# Linked Discourses With Deities

## The Chapter on a Reed

### N 1.1 Crossing the Flood *Oghataraṇasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
Monastery.

Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta's
Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,
"Good fellow, how did you cross the flood?"

"Neither standing nor swimming, good sir, I crossed the flood."

"But in what way did you cross the flood neither standing nor swimming?"

"When I stood, I sank under. When I swam, I was swept away. That's how I
crossed the flood neither standing nor swimming."

> "After a long time I see\
> a brahmin fully quenched.\
> Neither standing nor swimming,\
> he's crossed over clinging to the world."

This is what that deity said, and the teacher approved. Then that deity,
knowing that the teacher approved, bowed and respectfully circled the
Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.

### N 1.2 Liberation *Nimokkhasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta's
Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,
"Good fellow, do you understand liberation, emancipation, and seclusion
for sentient beings?"

"I do, sir."

"But how is it that you understand liberation, emancipation, and
seclusion for sentient beings?"

"Because I have ended relish for rebirth, and finished with perception
and consciousness. Due to the cessation and stilling of feelings, that,
good sir, is how I understand liberation, emancipation, and seclusion
for sentient beings."

### N 1.3 Led On *Upanīyasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha's
presence:

> "This life, so very short, is led onward.\
> One led on to old age has no shelter.\
> Seeing this peril in death,\
> do good deeds that bring you joy."
>
> "This life, so very short, is led onward;\
> one led on to old age has no shelter.\
> Seeing this peril in death,\
> a seeker of peace would drop the world's bait."

### N 1.4 Time Flies *Accentisutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha's
presence:

> "Time flies, nights pass by,\
> the stages of life leave us one by one.\
> Seeing this peril in death,\
> do good deeds that bring you joy."
>
> "Time flies, nights pass by,\
> the stages of life leave us one by one.\
> Seeing this peril in death,\
> a seeker of peace would drop the world's bait."

### N 1.5 Cut How Many? *Katichindasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha's
presence:

> "Cut how many? Drop how many?\
> Develop how many more?\
> When a mendicant slips how many chains\
> are they said to have crossed the flood?"
>
> "Five to cut, five to drop,\
> and five more to develop.\
> When a mendicant slips five chains\
> they're said to have crossed the flood."

### N 1.6 Awake *Jāgarasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha's
presence:

> "How many sleep among the waking?\
> How many wake among the sleeping?\
> By how many do you gather dust?\
> By how many are you cleansed?"
>
> "Five sleep among the waking.\
> Five wake among the sleeping.\
> By five you gather dust.\
> By five you're cleansed."

### N 1.7 Not Comprehending *Appaṭividitasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha's
presence:

> "Those have not deciphered the teachings\
> may be led astray by the doctrines of others.\
> Asleep, they have not woken up:\
> it is time for them to wake!"
>
> "Those who have well deciphered the teachings\
> won't be led astray by the doctrines of others.\
> They have woken up, they rightly know,\
> smoothly they walk in the rough."

### N 1.8 Very Confused *Susammuṭṭhasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha's
presence:

> "Those who are very confused about the teachings\
> may be led astray by the doctrines of others.\
> Asleep, they have not woken up:\
> it is time for them to wake!"
>
> "Those who are unconfused about the teachings,\
> won't be led astray by the doctrines of others.\
> They have woken up, they rightly know,\
> smoothly they walk in the rough."

### N 1.9 Fond of Conceit *Mānakāmasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha's
presence:

> "One fond of conceit can't be tamed,\
> no sage is lacking immersion.\
> Living negligent alone in the wilderness,\
> they can't pass beyond Death's dominion."
>
> "Having given up conceit, serene within oneself,\
> with a good heart, everywhere free;\
> living diligent alone in the wilderness,\
> they pass beyond Death's dominion."

### N 1.10 Wilderness *Araññasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Standing to one side, that deity addressed the Buddha in verse:

> "Living in the wilderness,\
> peaceful spiritual practitioners\
> eat just one meal a day:\
> so why is their complexion so clear?"
>
> "They don't grieve for the past,\
> nor do they long for the future;\
> they feed on whatever comes that day,\
> that's why their complexion's so clear.
>
> Because they long for the future,\
> and grieve for the past,\
> fools wither away,\
> like a green reed mowed down."

## The Chapter on the Garden of Delight

### N 1.11 The Garden of Delight *Nandanasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Once upon a time, mendicants, a certain deity of the company of the
thirty-three was amusing themselves in the Garden of Delight, escorted
by a band of nymphs, and supplied and provided with the five kinds of
heavenly sensual stimulation. On that occasion they recited this verse:

> 'They don't know pleasure\
> who don't see the Garden of Delight!\
> It's the abode of lordly gods,\
> the glorious host of Thirty!'

When they had spoken, another deity replied with this verse:

> 'Fool, don't you understand\
> the saying of the perfected ones:\
> All conditions are impermanent,\
> their nature is to rise and fall;\
> having arisen, they cease;\
> their stilling is blissful.'"

### N 1.12 Delight *Nandatisutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha's
presence:

> "Your children bring you delight!\
> Your cattle also bring you delight!\
> For attachments are a man's delight;\
> without attachments there's no delight."
>
> "Your children bring you sorrow.\
> Your cattle also bring you sorrow.\
> For attachments are a man's sorrow;\
> without attachments there are no sorrows."

### N 1.13 There's Nothing Like a Child *Natthiputtasamasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha's
presence:

> "There's no love like that for a child,\
> no wealth equal to cattle,\
> no light like that of the sun,\
> and of waters the ocean is paramount."
>
> "There's no love like that for oneself,\
> no wealth equal to grain,\
> no light like that of wisdom,\
> and of waters the rain is paramount."

### N 1.14 Aristocrats *Khattiyasutta*

> "An aristocrat is the best of bipeds,\
> an ox is the best of quadrupeds,\
> a maiden is the best of wives,\
> and a first-born the best of sons."
>
> "A Buddha is the best of bipeds,\
> a thoroughbred, the best of quadrupeds,\
> a good listener is the best of wives,\
> and the best of sons is loyal."

### N 1.15 Whispering *Saṇamānasutta*

> "In the still of high noon,\
> when the birds have settled down,\
> the formidable jungle whispers to itself:\
> that strikes me as so scary!"
>
> "In the still of high noon,\
> when the birds have settled down,\
> the formidable jungle whispers to itself:\
> that strikes me as so delightful!"

### N 1.16 Sleepiness and Sloth *Niddātandīsutta*

> "Sleepiness, sloth, and yawning,\
> discontent, and grogginess after eating:\
> because of this the noble path\
> doesn't shine for creatures here."
>
> "Sleepiness, sloth, and yawning,\
> discontent, and grogginess after eating:\
> when this is energetically fended off,\
> the noble path is purified."

### N 1.17 Hard to Do *Dukkarasutta*

> "Hard to do, hard to endure,\
> is the ascetic life for the inept,\
> for it has many narrow passes\
> where the fool founders."
>
> "How many days could an ascetic live\
> without controlling the mind?\
> They'd founder with each step,\
> under the sway of thoughts.
>
> A mendicant should collect their thoughts\
> as a tortoise draws its limbs into its shell.\
> Independent, not disturbing others,\
> quenched: they wouldn't blame anyone."

### N 1.18 Conscience *Hirīsutta*

> "Can a person constrained by conscience\
> be found in the world?\
> Who shies away from blame,\
> like a fine horse from the whip?"
>
> "Few are those constrained by conscience,\
> who live always mindful.\
> Having reached the end of suffering,\
> smoothly they walk in the rough."

### N 1.19 Little Hut *Kuṭikāsutta*

> "Don't you have a little hut?\
> Don't you have a little nest?\
> Don't you have any networks?\
> Aren't you free of shackles?"
>
> "Indeed I have no little hut.\
> Indeed I have no little nest.\
> Indeed I have no networks.\
> Indeed I'm free from shackles."
>
> "What do you think I call a little hut?\
> What do I call a little nest?\
> What do you think I call a network?\
> And what do I call a shackle?"
>
> "You call a mother a little hut;\
> and a wife a little nest.\
> You call children a network,\
> and you tell me craving's a shackle."
>
> "It's good you have no little hut!\
> It's good you have no little nest!\
> It's good you have no networks!\
> And good that you're free from shackles."

### N 1.20 With Samiddhi *Samiddhisutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Monastery.

Then Venerable Samiddhi rose at the crack of dawn and went to the hot
springs to bathe. When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood
in one robe drying his limbs.

Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire hot
springs, went up to Samiddhi, and, standing in the air, addressed him in
verse:

> "Mendicant, you seek alms before you eat;\
> you wouldn't seek alms after eating.\
> But you should eat first, then seek alms:\
> don't let the time pass you by."
>
> "I actually don't know the time;\
> it's hidden and unseen.\
> That's why I seek alms before eating,\
> so that the time may not pass me by!"

Then that deity landed on the ground and said to Samiddhi, "You've gone
forth while young, mendicant. With pristine black hair, you're blessed
with youth, in the prime of life, and you've never flirted with sensual
pleasures. Enjoy human sensual pleasures! Don't give up what is apparent
in the present to chase after what takes effect over time."

"I'm not, good fellow; I'm giving up what takes effect over time to
chase after what is apparent in the present. For the Buddha has said
that sensual pleasures take effect over time, with much suffering and
distress, and they're all the more full of drawbacks. But this teaching
is apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting
inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for
themselves."

"But in what way, mendicant, has the Buddha said that sensual pleasures
take effect over time, with much suffering and distress, and they're all
the more full of drawbacks? And how is this teaching apparent in the
present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so
that sensible people can know it for themselves?"

"I'm junior, good fellow, recently gone forth, newly come to this
teaching and training. I'm not able to explain this in detail. But the
Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha is staying
near Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Monatery. You should go to
him and ask about this matter. And you should remember it in line with
the Buddha's answer."

"It's not easy for us to approach the Buddha, as he is surrounded by
other illustrious deities. If you go to the Buddha and ask him about
this matter, we'll come along and listen to the teaching."

"Yes, good fellow," Venerable Samiddhi replied. He went to the Buddha,
bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then he
added:

"Sir, if that deity spoke the truth, he'll be close by."

When he had spoken, that deity said to Samiddhi, "Ask, mendicant, ask!
For I have arrived."

Then the Buddha addressed the deity in verse:

> "Sentient beings who perceive the communicable,\
> become established in the communicable.\
> Not understanding the communicable,\
> they fall under the yoke of Death.
>
> But having fully understood the communicable,\
> they don't conceive a communicator,\
> for they have nothing\
> by which they might be described.

Tell me if you understand, spirit."

"I don't understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha's brief
statement. Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed
meaning."

> "If you think that 'I'm equal,\
> special, or worse', you'll get into arguments.\
> Unwavering in the face of the three discriminations,\
> you'll have no thought 'I'm equal or special'.

"I don't understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha's brief
statement. Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed
meaning."

> "Assessment was given up, conceit rejected;\
> craving for name and form was cut off right here.\
> They cut the ties, untroubled,\
> \>with no need for hope.\
> Though gods and humans search for them\
> in this world and the world beyond,\
> \>they never find them,\
> not in heaven nor in any abode.

Tell me if you understand, spirit."

"This is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha's brief
statement:

> You should never do anything bad\
> by speech or mind or body in all the world.\
> Having given up sensual pleasures,\
> \>mindful and aware,\
> you shouldn't keep doing\
> \>what's painful and pointless."

## The Chapter on a Sword

### N 1.21 A Sword *Sattisutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha's
presence:

> "Like they're struck by a sword,\
> like their head was on fire,\
> a mendicant, mindful, should go forth,\
> to give up sensual desire."
>
> "Like they're struck by a sword,\
> like their head was on fire,\
> a mendicant, mindful, should go forth,\
> to give up substantialist view."

### N 1.22 Impact *Phusatisutta*

> "It doesn't impact a person who doesn't impact others.\
> It impacts a person because they impact others.\
> That's why it impacts one who impacts,\
> who wrongs one who's done no wrong."
>
> "Whoever wrongs a man who's done no wrong,\
> a pure man who has not a blemish,\
> the evil backfires on the fool,\
> like fine dust thrown upwind."

### N 1.23 A Tangle *Jaṭāsutta*

> "Tangled within, tangled without:\
> these people are tangled in tangles.\
> I ask you this, Gotama:\
> who can untangle this tangle?"
>
> "A wise person grounded in ethics,\
> developing the mind and wisdom,\
> a keen and alert mendicant---\
> they can untangle this tangle.
>
> Those in whom greed, hate, and ignorance\
> have faded away;\
> the perfected ones with defilements ended---\
> they have untangled the tangle.
>
> And where name and form\
> cease with nothing left over;\
> as well as impingement and perception of form:\
> it's there that the tangle is cut."

### N 1.24 Shielding the Mind *Manonivāraṇasutta*

> "Whatever you've shielded the mind from\
> can't cause you suffering.\
> So you should shield the mind from everything,\
> then you're freed from all suffering."
>
> "You needn't shield the mind from everything.\
> When the mind is under control,\
> you need only shield the mind\
> from where the bad things come."

### N 1.25 A Perfected One *Arahantasutta*

> "When a mendicant is perfected, proficient,\
> with defilements ended, bearing the final body:\
> would they say, 'I speak',\
> or even 'they speak to me'?"
>
> "When a mendicant is perfected, proficient,\
> with defilements ended, bearing the final body:\
> they would say, 'I speak',\
> and also 'they speak to me'.\
> Skillful, understanding the world's labels,\
> they'd use these terms as no more than expressions."
>
> "When a mendicant is perfected, proficient,\
> with defilements ended, bearing the final body:\
> is such a mendicant drawing close to conceit\
> if they'd say, 'I speak',\
> or even 'they speak to me'?"
>
> "Someone who has given up conceit has no ties,\
> the ties of conceit are all dissipated.\
> Though that intelligent person has transcended conceiving,\
> they'd still say, 'I speak',
>
> and also 'they speak to me'.\
> Skillful, understanding the world's labels,\
> they'd use these terms as no more than expressions."

### N 1.26 Lamps *Pajjotasutta*

> "How many lamps are there\
> that light up the world?\
> We've come to ask you, sir:\
> how are we to understand this?"
>
> "There are four lamps in the world,\
> a fifth is not found.\
> The sun blazes by day,\
> the moon glows at night,
>
> while a fire lights up both\
> by day and by night.\
> But a Buddha is the best of lights:\
> this is the supreme radiance."

### N 1.27 Streams *Sarasutta*

> "From where do streams turn back?\
> Where does the cycle spin no more?\
> Where do name and form\
> cease with nothing left over?"
>
> "Where water and earth,\
> fire and air find no footing---
>
> from here the streams turn back;\
> here the cycle spins no more;\
> here name-and-form\
> cease with nothing left over."

### N 1.28 Affluent *Mahaddhanasutta*

> "The affluent and the wealthy,\
> even the aristocrats who rule the land,\
> are jealous of each other,\
> insatiable in sensual pleasures.
>
> Among those of such an avid nature,\
> flowing along the stream of lives,\
> who here has given up craving?\
> Who in the world is not avid?"
>
> "Having given up their home, their child, their cattle,\
> and all that they love, they went forth.\
> Having given up desire and hate,\
> having dispelled ignorance,\
> the perfected ones with defilements ended---\
> they in the world are not avid."

### N 1.29 Four Wheels *Catucakkasutta*

> "Four are its wheels, and nine its doors;\
> it's stuffed full, bound with greed,\
> and born from a bog.\
> Great hero, how will I keep going?"
>
> "Having cut the strap and harness---\
> the wicked desire and greed---\
> and having plucked out craving, root and all:\
> that's how you will keep going."

### N 1.30 Antelope Calves *Eṇijaṅghasutta*

> "O hero so lean, with antelope calves,\
> not greedy, eating little,\
> an elephant, wandering alone like a lion,\
> you're not concerned for sensual pleasures.\
> We've come to ask a question:\
> How is one released from all suffering?"
>
> "The world has five kinds of sensual stimulation,\
> and the mind is said to be the sixth.\
> When you've discarded desire for these,\
> you're released from all suffering."

## The Chapter on the Satullapa Group

### N 1.31 Virtuous *Sabbhisutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
Monastery.

Then, late at night, several glorious deities of the Satullapa Group,
lighting up the entire Jeta's Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and
stood to one side. Standing to one side, one deity recited this verse in
the Buddha's presence:

> "Associate only with the virtuous!\
> Try to get close to the virtuous!\
> Understanding the true teaching of the good,\
> things get better, not worse."

Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "Associate only with the virtuous!\
> Try to get close to the virtuous!\
> Understanding the true teaching of the good,\
> wisdom is gained---but not from anyone else."

Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "Associate only with the virtuous!\
> Try to get close to the virtuous!\
> Understanding the true teaching of the good,\
> you grieve not among the grieving."

Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "Associate only with the virtuous!\
> Try to get close to the virtuous!\
> Understanding the true teaching of the good,\
> you shine among your relatives."

Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "Associate only with the virtuous!\
> Try to get close to the virtuous!\
> Understanding the true teaching of the good,\
> sentient beings go to a good place."

Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "Associate only with the virtuous!\
> Try to get close to the virtuous!\
> Understanding the true teaching of the good,\
> sentient beings live happily."

Then another deity said to the Buddha, "Sir, who has spoken well?"

"You've all spoken well in your own way. However, listen to me also:

> Associate only with the virtuous!\
> Try to get close to the virtuous!\
> Understanding the true teaching of the good,\
> you're released from all suffering."

That is what the Buddha said. Then those deities, knowing that the
teacher approved, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him
on their right, before vanishing right there.

### N 1.32 Stinginess *Maccharisutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

Then, late at night, several glorious deities of the Satullapa Group,
lighting up the entire Jeta's Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and
stood to one side. Standing to one side, one deity recited this verse in
the Buddha's presence:

> "Because of stinginess and negligence\
> a gift is not given.\
> Wanting merit,\
> a smart person would give."

Then another deity recited these verses in the Buddha's presence:

> "When a miser fails to give because of fear,\
> the very thing they're afraid of comes to pass.\
> The hunger and thirst\
> that a miser fears\
> hurt the fool\
> in this world and the next.
>
> So you should dispel stinginess,\
> overcoming that stain, and give a gift.\
> The good deeds of sentient beings\
> support them in the next world."

Then another deity recited these verses in the Buddha's presence:

> "Among the dead they do not die,\
> those who, like fellow travelers on the road,\
> are happy to provide, though they have but little.\
> This is an ancient teaching.
>
> Some who have little are happy to provide,\
> while some who have much don't wish to give.\
> An offering given from little\
> is multiplied a thousand times."

Then another deity recited these verses in the Buddha's presence:

> "Giving what's hard to give,\
> doing what's hard to do;\
> the wicked don't act like this,\
> for the teaching of the good is hard to follow.
>
> That's why the virtuous and the wicked\
> have different destinations after here.\
> The wicked go to hell,\
> while the virtuous are bound for heaven."

Then another deity said to the Buddha, "Sir, who has spoken well?"

"You've all spoken well in your own way. However, listen to me also:

> A hundred thousand people\
> \>making a thousand sacrifices\
> isn't worth a fraction\
> of one who lives rightly, wandering for gleanings,\
> or one who supports their partner\
> \>from what little they have."

Then another deity addressed the Buddha in verse:

> "Why doesn't that sacrifice of theirs, so abundant and magnificent,\
> equal the value of a moral person's gift?\
> How is it that a hundred thousand people\
> \>making a thousand sacrifices\
> isn't worth a fraction\
> \>of what's offered by such a person?"
>
> "Some give based on immorality---\
> after injuring, killing, and tormenting.\
> Such an offering---tearful, violent---\
> in no way equals the value of a moral person's gift.
>
> That's how it is that a hundred thousand people\
> \>making a thousand sacrifices\
> isn't worth a fraction\
> \>of what's offered by such a person."

### N 1.33 Good *Sādhusutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then, late at night, several glorious deities of the Satullapa Group,
lighting up the entire Jeta's Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and
stood to one side. Standing to one side, one deity expressed this
heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha's presence:

> "Good, sir, is giving!\
> Because of stinginess and negligence\
> a gift is not given.\
> Wanting merit,\
> a smart person would give."

Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha's
presence:

> "Good, sir, is giving!\
> Even when one has little, giving is good.
>
> Some who have little are happy to provide,\
> while some who have much don't wish to give.\
> An offering given from little\
> is multiplied a thousand times."

Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha's
presence:

> "Good, sir, is giving!\
> Even when one has little, giving is good.\
> And it's also good to give out of faith.\
> Giving and warfare are similar, they say,\
> for even a few of the good may conquer the many.\
> If a faithful person gives even a little,\
> it still brings them happiness in the hereafter."

Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha's
presence:

> "Good, sir, is giving!\
> Even when one has little, giving is good.\
> And it's also good to give out of faith.\
> And it's also good to give legitimate wealth.
>
> A man who gives legitimate wealth,\
> earned by his efforts and initiative,\
> has passed over Yama's Vetaraṇi River;\
> that mortal arrives at celestial fields."

Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha's
presence:

> "Good, sir, is giving!\
> Even when one has little, giving is good.\
> And it's also good to give out of faith.\
> And it's also good to give legitimate wealth.\
> And it's also good to give intelligently.
>
> The Holy One praises giving intelligently\
> to those worthy of offerings here\
> \>in the world of the living.\
> What's given to these is very fruitful,\
> like seeds sown in a fertile field."

Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha's
presence:

> "Good, sir, is giving!\
> Even when one has little, giving is good.\
> And it's also good to give out of faith.\
> And it's also good to give legitimate wealth.\
> And it's also good to give intelligently.\
> And it's also good to be restrained\
> \>when it comes to living creatures.
>
> One who lives without harming any living being\
> never does bad because of others' blame;\
> for in that case they praise the coward, not the brave;\
> and the virtuous never do bad out of fear."

Then another deity said to the Buddha, "Sir, who has spoken well?"

"You've all spoken well in your own way. However, listen to me also:

> It's true that giving is praised in many ways\
> but the path of the teaching is better than giving,\
> for in days old and older still,\
> the wise and virtuous even attained extinction."

### N 1.34 There Are None *Nasantisutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Monastery.

Then, late at night, several glorious deities of the Satullapa Group,
lighting up the entire Jeta's Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and
stood to one side. Standing to one side, one deity recited this verse in
the Buddha's presence:

> "Among humans there are no sensual pleasures\
> \>that are permanent.\
> Here there are sensuous things, bound to which,\
> drunk on which, there's no coming back.\
> That person doesn't return from Death's dominion."
>
> "Misery is born of desire; suffering is born of desire;\
> when desire is removed, misery is removed;\
> when misery is removed, suffering is removed."
>
> "The world's pretty things aren't sensual pleasures.\
> Greedy intention is a person's sensual pleasure.\
> The world's pretty things stay just as they are,\
> but the attentive remove desire for them.
>
> Give up anger, get rid of conceit,\
> and get past all the fetters.\
> Sufferings don't torment the one who has nothing,\
> not clinging to name and form.
>
> Assessment was given up, conceit rejected;\
> craving for name and form was cut off right here.\
> They cut the ties, untroubled,\
> \>with no need for hope.\
> Though gods and humans search for them\
> in this world and the world beyond,\
> \>they never find them,\
> not in heaven nor in any abode."
>
> "If neither gods nor humans see one freed in this way,"\
> *said Venerable Mogharājā,*\
> "in this world or the world beyond,\
> are those who revere that supreme person,\
> who lives for the good of mankind,\
> \>also worthy of praise?"
>
> "The mendicants who revere one freed in this way,"\
> *said the Buddha,*\
> "are also worthy of praise, Mogharājā.\
> Having understood the teaching\
> \>and given up doubt,\
> those mendicants can slip their chains."

### N 1.35 Disdain *Ujjhānasaññisutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Monastery.

Then, late at night, several glorious deities of the Disdainful Group,
lighting up the entire Jeta's Grove, went up to the Buddha, and stood in
the air. Standing in the air, one deity recited this verse in the
Buddha's presence:

> "Someone who pretends\
> to be other than they really are,\
> is like a cheating gambler\
> who enjoys what was gained by theft.
>
> You should only say what you would do;\
> you shouldn't say what you wouldn't do.\
> The wise will recognize\
> one who talks without doing."
>
> "Not just by speaking,\
> nor solely by listening,\
> are you able to progress\
> on this hard path,\
> by which the attentive practicing absorption\
> are released from Māra's bonds.
>
> The attentive certainly don't act like that,\
> for they understand the way of the world.\
> The attentive are quenched by understanding,\
> they've crossed over clinging to the world."

Then those deities landed on the ground, bowed with their heads at the
Buddha's feet and said, "We have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish,
stupid, and unskillful of us to imagine we could attack the Buddha!
Please, sir, accept our mistake for what it is, so we will restrain
ourselves in future."

At that, the Buddha smiled.

Then those deities, becoming even more disdainful, flew up in the air.
One deity recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "If you don't give your pardon\
> when a mistake is confessed,\
> with hidden anger and heavy hate,\
> you're stuck in your enmity."
>
> "If no mistake is found,\
> if no-one's gone astray,\
> and enmities are settled,\
> then who could have been unskillful?"
>
> "Who makes no mistakes?\
> Who doesn't go astray?\
> Who doesn't fall into confusion?\
> Who is attentive, ever mindful?"
>
> "The Realized One, the Buddha,\
> sympathetic for all beings:\
> that's who makes no mistakes,\
> and that's who doesn't go astray.\
> He doesn't fall into confusion,\
> for he's attentive, ever mindful.
>
> If you don't give your pardon\
> when a mistake is confessed,\
> with hidden anger and heavy hate,\
> you're stuck in your enmity.\
> I don't approve of such enmity,\
> and so I pardon your mistake."

### N 1.36 Faith *Saddhāsutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

Then, late at night, several glorious deities of the Satullapa Group,
lighting up the entire Jeta's Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and
stood to one side. Standing to one side, one deity recited this verse in
the Buddha's presence:

> "Faith is a person's partner.\
> If faithlessness doesn't linger,\
> fame and renown are theirs,\
> and when they discard this corpse they go to heaven."

Then another deity recited these verses in the Buddha's presence:

> "Give up anger, get rid of conceit,\
> and get past all the fetters.\
> Chains don't torment one who has nothing,\
> not clinging to name and form."
>
> "Fools and simpletons\
> devote themselves to negligence.\
> But the wise protect diligence\
> as their best treasure.
>
> Don't devote yourself to negligence,\
> or delight in erotic intimacy.\
> For if you're diligent and practice absorption,\
> you'll attain ultimate happiness."

### N 1.37 The Congregation *Samayasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in the
land of the Sakyans, in the Great Wood near Kapilavatthu, together with
a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants, all of whom were
perfected ones. And most of the deities from ten solar systems had
gathered to see the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants.

Then four deities of the Pure Abodes, aware of what was happening,
thought: "Why don't we go to the Buddha and each recite a verse in his
presence?"

Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm,
they vanished from the Pure Abodes and reappeared in front of the
Buddha. They bowed to the Buddha and stood to one side. Standing to one
side, one deity recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "There's a great congregation in the woods,\
> where hosts of gods have assembled.\
> We've come to this righteous congregation\
> to see the invincible Saṅgha!"

Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "The mendicants there have immersion,\
> they've straightened their own minds.\
> Like a charioteer holding the reins,\
> the astute ones protect their senses."

Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "They snapped the post and snapped the cross-bar,\
> unstirred, they tore out the boundary post.\
> They live pure and immaculate,\
> the young giants tamed by the Clear-eyed One."

Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "Anyone who has gone to the Buddha for refuge\
> won't go to a plane of loss.\
> After giving up this human body,\
> they swell the hosts of gods."

### N 1.38 A Splinter *Sakalikasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha in the Maddakucchi deer park.

Now at that time the Buddha's foot had been cut by a splinter. The
Buddha was stricken by harrowing pains; physical feelings that were
painful, sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, and disagreeable. But he
endured unbothered, with mindfulness and situational awareness. And then
he spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion's
posture---on the right side, placing one foot on top of the
other---mindful and aware.

Then, late at night, seven hundred glorious deities of the Satullapa
Group, lighting up the entire Maddakucchi, went up to the Buddha, bowed,
and stood to one side.

Standing to one side, one deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in
the Buddha's presence: "The ascetic Gotama is such an elephant, sir! And
as an elephant, he endures painful physical feelings that have come
up---sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, and disagreeable---unbothered,
with mindfulness and situational awareness."

Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha's
presence: "The ascetic Gotama is such a lion, sir! And as a lion, he
endures painful physical feelings ... unbothered."

Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha's
presence: "The ascetic Gotama is such a thoroughbred, sir! And as a
thoroughbred, he endures painful physical feelings ... unbothered."

Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha's
presence: "The ascetic Gotama is such a chief bull, sir! And as a chief
bull, he endures painful physical feelings ... unbothered."

Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha's
presence: "The ascetic Gotama is such a behemoth, sir! And as a
behemoth, he endures painful physical feelings ... unbothered."

Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha's
presence: "The ascetic Gotama is truly tamed, sir! And as someone tamed,
he endures painful physical feelings ... unbothered."

Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha's
presence: "See, his immersion is so well developed, and his mind is so
well freed---not leaning forward or pulling back, and not held in place
by forceful suppression. If anyone imagines that they can overcome such
an elephant of a man, a lion of a man, a thoroughbred of a man, a chief
bull of a man, a behemoth of a man, a tamed man---what is that but a
failure to see?"

> "Learned in the five Vedas, brahmins practice\
> mortification for a full century.\
> But their minds are not properly freed,\
> for those of base character don't cross to the far shore.
>
> Seized by craving,\
> \>attached to precepts and observances,\
> they practice rough and fervent mortification for a hundred years.\
> But their minds are not properly freed,\
> for those of base character don't cross to the far shore.
>
> Someone who's fond of conceit can't be tamed,\
> and someone without immersion can't be a sage.\
> Living negligent alone in the wilderness,\
> they can't pass beyond Death's dominion."
>
> "Having given up conceit, serene within oneself,\
> with a good heart, everywhere free;\
> living diligent alone in the wilderness,\
> they pass beyond Death's dominion."

### N 1.39 With Pajjunna's Daughter (1st) *Paṭhamapajjunnadhītusutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked
roof.

Then, late at night, the beautiful Kokanadā, Pajjunna's
daughter, lighting up the entire Great Wood, went up to the Buddha,
bowed, stood to one side, and recited these verses in the Buddha's
presence:

> "Staying in the woods of Vesālī\
> is the Buddha, best of beings.\
> Kokanadā am I who worships him,\
> Kokanadā, Pajjuna's daughter.
>
> Previously I had only heard\
> the teaching realized by the Clear-eyed One.\
> But now I know it as a witness\
> while the sage, the Holy One teaches.
>
> There are simpletons who go about\
> denouncing the teaching of the noble ones.\
> They fall into the terrible Hell of Screams\
> where they suffer long.
>
> There are those who have found\
> \>acceptance and peace\
> in the teaching of the noble ones.\
> After giving up this human body,\
> they swell the hosts of gods."

### N 1.40 With Pajjunna's Daughter (2nd) *Dutiyapajjunnadhītusuttaṁ*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked
roof.

Then, late at night, the beautiful Kokanadā the Younger,
Pajjunna's daughter, lighting up the entire Great Wood, went up to the
Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and recited these verses in the
Buddha's presence:

> "Kokanadā, Pajjunna's daughter, came here,\
> beautiful as a flash of lightning.\
> Revering the Buddha and the teaching,\
> she spoke these verses full of meaning.
>
> The teaching is such that\
> I could analyze it in many different ways.\
> However, I will state the meaning in brief\
> as far as I have learned it by heart.
>
> You should never do anything bad\
> by speech or mind or body in all the world.\
> Having given up sensual pleasures,\
> \>mindful and aware,\
> you shouldn't keep doing\
> \>what's painful and pointless."

## The Chapter on Fire

### N 1.41 On Fire *Ādittasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
Monastery.

Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta's
Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and recited
these verses in the Buddha's presence:

> "When your house is on fire,\
> you rescue the pot\
> that's useful,\
> not the one that's burnt.
>
> And as the world is on fire\
> with old age and death,\
> you should rescue by giving,\
> for what's given is rescued.
>
> What's given has happiness as its fruit,\
> but not what isn't given.\
> Bandits take it, or rulers,\
> it's consumed by fire, or lost.
>
> Then in the end this corpse is cast off,\
> along with all your possessions.\
> Knowing this, a clever person\
> would enjoy what they have and also give it away.\

> "Giving what do you give strength?\

> Please answer my question."
>
> "Giving food you give strength.\
> Giving clothes you give beauty.\
> Giving a vehicle you give happiness.\
> Giving a lamp you give vision.
>
> And the giver of all\
> is the one who gives a residence.\
> But a person who teaches the Dhamma\
> gives the gift of freedom from death."

### N 1.43 Food *Annasutta*

> "Both gods and humans\
> enjoy their food.\
> So what's the name of the spirit\
> who doesn't like food?"
>
> "Those who give with faith\
> and a clear and confident heart,\
> partake of food\
> in this world and the next.

> So you should dispel stinginess,\
> overcoming that stain, and give a gift.\
> The good deeds of sentient beings\

### N 1.44 One Root *Ekamūlasutta*

### N 1.45 Peerless *Anomasutta*

> Behold him of peerless name\
> \>who sees the subtle meaning,\
> giver of wisdom,\
> \>unattached to the realm of sensuality:\

> the great seer treading the noble road."

### N 1.46 Nymphs *Accharāsutta*

> "It's resounding with a group of nymphs,\

### N 1.47 Planters *Vanaropasutta*

### N 1.48 Jeta's Grove *Jetavanasutta*

### N 1.49 Stingy *Maccharisutta*

> "Those folk in the world who are stingy,\

> for others who give.
>
> What kind of result do they reap?\

>
> "Those folk in the world who are stingy,\
> miserly and abusive,\
> setting up obstacles\
> for others who give:
>
> they're reborn in hell,\
> the animal realm, or Yama's world.\
> If they return to the human state,\
> they're born in a poor family,
>
> where clothes, food, pleasure, and play\
> are hard to find.\
> They don't even get\
> what they hope for from others.\
> This is the result in the present life,\

>
> "We understand what you're saying,\
> and ask another question, Gotama.\
> What about those who've gained the human state,\
> who are bountiful and rid of stinginess,
>
> confident in the Buddha and the teaching,\
> with keen respect for the Saṅgha?\

### N 1.50 With Ghaṭīkāra *Ghaṭīkārasutta*

# Linked Discourses on Gods

## Chapter One

### N 2.1 With Kassapa (1st) *Paṭhamakassapasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery.

Then, late at night, the glorious god Kassapa, lighting up the entire
Jeta's Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said
to him, "The Buddha has revealed the mendicant, but not his instructions
to a mendicant."

"Well then, Kassapa, clarify this matter yourself."

> "They should train in following good advice,\
> in attending closely to ascetics,\
> in sitting alone in hidden places,\
> and in calming the mind."

That's what the god Kassapa said, and the teacher approved. Then
Kassapa, knowing that the teacher approved, bowed and respectfully
circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right
there.

### N 2.2 With Kassapa (2nd) *Dutiyakassapasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Standing to one side, the god Kassapa recited this verse in the Buddha's
presence:

> "Suppose a mendicant is a meditator, freed in mind.\
> If they want to reach the heart's peace,\
> having known the arising and passing of the world,\
> good-hearted, independent, that is their reward."

### N 2.3 With Māgha *Māghasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then, late at night, the glorious god Māgha, lighting up
the entire Jeta's Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one
side, and addressed the Buddha in verse:

> "When what is incinerated do you sleep at ease?\
> When what is incinerated is there no sorrow?\
> What is the one thing\
> whose killing you approve?"
>
> "When anger's incinerated you sleep at ease.\
> When anger's incinerated there is no sorrow.\
> Anger has a poisonous root,\
> and a honey tip, O slayer of the Constrictor.\
> The noble ones praise its killing,\
> for when it's incinerated there is no sorrow."

### N 2.4 With Māghadha *Māgadhasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Standing to one side, the god Māgadha addressed the Buddha
in verse:

> "How many lamps are there\
> that light up the world?\
> We've come to ask the Buddha;\
> how are we to understand this?"
>
> "There are four lamps in the world,\
> a fifth is not found.\
> The sun blazes by day,\
> the moon glows at night,
>
> while a fire lights up both\
> by day and by night.\
> But a Buddha is the best of lights:\
> this is the supreme radiance."

### N 2.5 With Dāmali *Dāmalisutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then, late at night, the glorious god Dāmali, lighting up
the entire Jeta's Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one
side, and recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "This is what should be done by a brahmin:\
> unrelenting striving.\
> Then, with the giving up of sensual pleasures,\
> they won't hope to be reborn."
>
> "The brahmin has nothing left to do,"\
> *said the Buddha to Dāmali,*\
> "for they've completed their task.\
> So long as a person fails to gain a footing in the river,\
> they swim with every limb.\
> But someone who has gained a footing\
> \>and stands on dry land\
> need not swim,\
> \>for they have reached the far shore.
>
> Dāmali, this is a simile for the brahmin,\
> alert, a meditator who has ended defilements.\
> Since they've reached the end of rebirth and death,\
> they need not swim,\
> \>for they have reached the far shore."

### N 2.6 With Kāmada *Kāmadasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Standing to one side, the god Kāmada said to the Buddha,
"It's too hard, Blessed One! It's just too hard!"

> "They do it even though it's hard,"\
> *said the Buddha to Kāmada,*\
> "the stable trainees with ethics, and immersion.\
> For one who has entered the homeless life,\
> contentment brings happiness."

"Such contentment, Blessed One, is hard to find."

> "They find it even though it's hard,"\
> *said the Buddha to Kāmada,*\
> "those who love peace of mind;\
> whose minds love to meditate\
> day and night."

"But it's hard, Blessed One, to immerse this mind in
samādhi."

> "They become immersed in samādhi\
> \>even though it's hard,"\
> *said the Buddha to Kāmada,*\
> "those who love calming the faculties.\
> Having cut through the net of Death,\
> the noble ones, Kāmada, go on their way."

"But this path, Blessed One, is rough and hard to travel."

> "Though it's rough, hard to travel,\
> the noble ones, Kāmada, go on their way.\
> The ignoble fall headfirst\
> on a rough path.\
> But the path of the noble ones is smooth,\
> for the noble ones are smooth amid the rough."

### N 2.7 With Pañcālacaṇḍa *Pañcālacaṇḍasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Standing to one side, the god Pañcālacaṇḍa recited this
verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "The opening amid confinement\
> was discovered by the Buddha of vast intelligence,\
> who woke up to absorption,\
> the sage, the solitary bull."
>
> "Even amid confinement they discover,"\
> *said the Buddha to Pañcālacaṇḍa,*\
> "the principle for attaining extinguishment.\
> Those who have acquired mindfulness\
> are perfectly serene in samādhi."

### N 2.8 With Tāyana *Tāyanasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then, late at night, the glorious god Tāyana, formerly a
religious founder, lighting up the entire Jeta's Grove, went up to the
Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and recited these verses in the
Buddha's presence:

> "Strive and cut the stream!\
> Dispel sensual pleasures, brahmin.\
> A sage who doesn't give up sensual pleasures\
> is not reborn in a unified state.
>
> If one is to do what should be done,\
> one should staunchly strive.\
> For the life gone forth when laxly led\
> just stirs up dust all the more.
>
> A bad deed is better left undone,\
> for it will plague you later on.\
> A good deed is better done,\
> one that does not plague you.
>
> When kusa grass is wrongly grasped\
> it only cuts the hand.\
> So too, the ascetic life, when wrongly taken,\
> drags you to hell.
>
> Any lax act,\
> any corrupt observance,\
> or suspicious spiritual life,\
> is not very fruitful."

That's what the god Tāyana said. Then he bowed and
respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right side, before
vanishing right there.

Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that
had happened.

"Mendicants, tonight, the glorious god Tāyana, formerly a
religious founder, lighting up the entire Jeta's Grove, came to me,
bowed, stood to one side, and recited these verses in my presence." The
Buddha repeated the verses in full, adding:

"That's what the god Tāyana said. Then he bowed and
respectfully circled me, keeping me on his right side, before vanishing
right there. Mendicants, learn the verses of Tāyana!
Memorize the verses of Tāyana! Remember the verses of
Tāyana! These verses are beneficial and relate to the
fundamentals of the spiritual life."

### N 2.9 The Moon *Candimasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time the Moon God had been seized by Rāhu, lord
of titans. Then the Moon God, recollecting the Buddha, at that time
recited this verse:

> "Homage to you, Buddha, hero!\
> You're free in every way.\
> I've wandered into confinement:\
> be my refuge!"

Then the Buddha addressed Rāhu in verse concerning the Moon
God:

> "The Moon God has gone for refuge\
> to the Realized One, the perfected one.\
> The Buddhas have compassion for the world---\
> so Rāhu, release the Moon!"

Then Rāhu, having released the Moon, rushed to see
Vepacitti, lord of titans and stood to one side, shocked and awestruck.
Vepacitti addressed him in verse:

> "Why the rush?\
> Rāhu, you released the Moon\
> and came here looking like you're in shock:\
> why do you stand there so scared?"
>
> "My head would have exploded in seven pieces,\
> I would have found no happiness in life,\
> if, when enchanted by the Buddha's verse,\
> I had not released the Moon."

### N 2.10 The Sun *Sūriyasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time the Sun God had been seized by Rāhu, lord
of titans. Then the Sun God, recollecting the Buddha, at that time
recited this verse:

> "Homage to you, Buddha, hero!\
> You're everywhere free.\
> I've wandered into confinement:\
> be my refuge!"

Then the Buddha addressed Rāhu in verse concerning the Sun
God:

> "The Sun God has gone for refuge\
> to the Realized One, the perfected one.\
> The Buddhas have compassion for the world---\
> so Rāhu, release the Sun!
>
> He is a beacon in the darkness,\
> the blazing sun, circle of magnificent flame.\
> Rāhu, do not swallow him as he traverses the sky.\
> Rāhu, release my offspring, the Sun!"

Then Rāhu, having released the Sun, rushed to see
Vepacitti, lord of titans and stood to one side, shocked and awestruck.
Vepacitti addressed him in verse:

> "Why the rush?\
> Rāhu, you released the Sun\
> and came here looking like you're in shock:\
> why do you stand there so scared?"
>
> "My head would have exploded in seven pieces,\
> I would have found no joy in life,\
> if, when enchanted by the Buddha's verse,\
> I had not released the Sun."

## The Chapter with Anāthapiṇḍika

### N 2.11 With Candimasa *Candimasasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then, late at night, the glorious god Candimasa, lighting up the entire
Jeta's Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and
recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "Like deer in a mosquito-free marsh,\
> they will reach a safe place\
> having entered the absorptions,\
> unified, alert, and mindful."
>
> "Like fish when the net is cut,\
> they will reach the far shore\
> having entered the absorptions,\
> diligent, with vices discarded."

### N 2.12 With Vishnu *Veṇḍusutta*

Standing to one side, the god Vishnu recited this verse in the Buddha's
presence:

> "Happy are the children of Manu\
> who pay homage to the Holy One!\
> They apply themselves to Gotama's instructions,\
> diligently training."
>
> "Those who practice absorption\
> \>in accord with the training",\
> *said the Buddha to Vishnu,*\
> "in the way of teaching I've proclaimed,\
> they're in time to be diligent;\
> they won't fall under the sway of Death."

### N 2.13 With Dīghalaṭṭhi *Dīghalaṭṭhisutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding
ground.

Then, late at night, the glorious god Dīghalaṭṭhi, lighting
up the entire Bamboo Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one
side, and recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "Suppose a mendicant is a meditator, freed in mind.\
> If they want to reach the heart's peace,\
> having known the arising and passing of the world,\
> good-hearted, independent, that is their reward."

### N 2.14 With Nandana *Nandanasutta*

Standing to one side, the god Nandana addressed the Buddha in verse:

> "I ask you, Gotama, whose wisdom is vast,\
> the Blessed One\
> \>of unhindered knowledge and vision.\
> What kind of person do they call ethical?\
> What kind of person do they call wise?\
> What kind of person lives on\
> \>after transcending suffering?\
> What kind of person is worshipped by the deities?"
>
> "A person who is ethical, wise, evolved,\
> becomes serene, loving absorption, mindful,\
> who's gotten rid of and given up all sorrows,\
> with defilements ended, they bear their final body.
>
> That's the kind of person they call ethical.\

### N 2.15 With Candana *Candanasutta*

Standing to one side, the god Candana addressed the Buddha in verse:

> "Who here crosses the flood,\
> tireless all day and night?\
> Who, not standing and unsupported,\

>
> "Someone who is always endowed with ethics,\
> wise and serene,\
> energetic and resolute,\
> crosses the flood so hard to cross.
>
> Someone who desists from sensual perception,\
> has moved past the fetter of form,\
> and has finished with relishing and greed\
> does not sink in the deep."

### N 2.16 With Vāsudatta *Vāsudattasutta*

Standing to one side, the god Vāsudatta recited this verse
in the Buddha's presence:

> "Like they're struck by a sword,\
> like their head was on fire,\
> a mendicant should wander mindful,\
> to give up sensual desire."
>
> "Like they're struck by a sword,\
> like their head was on fire,\
> a mendicant should wander mindful,\
> to give up substantialist view."

### N 2.17 With Subrahmā *Subrahmasutta*

Standing to one side, the god Subrahmā addressed the Buddha
in verse:

> "This mind is always anxious,\
> this mind is always stressed\
> about stresses that haven't arisen\
> and those that have.\
> If there is a state free of anxiety,\
> please answer my question."
>
> "Not without understanding and fervor,\
> not without restraining the sense faculties,\
> not without letting go of everything,\
> do I see safety for living creatures."

That is what the Buddha said. ... The god vanished right there.

### N 2.18 With Kakudha *Kakudhasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāketa in the deer park at the Añjana Wood.

Then, late at night, the glorious god Kakudha, lighting up the entire
Añjana Wood, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one
side, and said to him, "Do you delight, ascetic?"

"What have I gained, sir?"

"Well then, ascetic, do you sorrow?"

"What have I lost, sir?"

"Well then, ascetic, do you neither delight nor sorrow?"

"Yes, sir."

> "I hope you're untroubled, mendicant,\
> I hope that delight isn't found in you.\
> I hope that discontent doesn't\
> overwhelm you as you sit alone."
>
> "I'm genuinely untroubled, spirit,\
> and no delight is found in me.\
> And also discontent doesn't\
> overwhelm me as I sit alone."
>
> "How are you untroubled, mendicant?\
> How is delight not found in you?\
> How does discontent not\
> overwhelm you as you sit alone?"
>
> "Delight is born from misery,\
> misery is born from delight;\
> sir, you should know me as\
> a mendicant free of delight and misery."
>
> "After a long time I see\
> a brahmin fully quenched.\
> A mendicant free of delight and misery,\
> he has crossed over clinging to the world."

### N 2.19 With Uttara *Uttarasutta*

At Rājagaha. Standing to one side, the god Uttara recited
this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "This life, so very short, is led onward.\
> One led on to old age has no shelter.\
> Seeing this peril in death,\
> do good deeds that bring you joy."
>
> "This life, so very short, is led onward.\
> One led on to old age has no shelter.\
> Seeing this peril in death,\
> a seeker of peace would drop the world's bait."

### N 2.20 With Anāthapiṇḍika *Anāthapiṇḍikasutta*

Standing to one side, the god Anāthapiṇḍika recited these
verses in the Buddha's presence:

> "This is indeed that Jeta's Grove,\
> frequented by the Saṅgha of seers,\
> where the King of Dhamma stayed:\
> it brings me joy!
>
> Deeds, knowledge, and principle;\
> ethical conduct, an excellent livelihood;\
> by these are mortals purified,\
> not by clan or wealth.
>
> That's why an astute person,\
> seeing what's good for themselves,\
> would examine the teaching rationally,\
> and thus be purified in it.
>
> Sāriputta is full of wisdom,\
> ethics, and peace.\
> Even a mendicant who has crossed over\
> might at best equal him."

This is what the god Anāthapiṇḍika said. Then he bowed and
respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right side, before
vanishing right there.

Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
"Mendicants, tonight, a certain glorious god, lighting up the entire
Jeta's Grove, came to me, bowed, stood to one side, and recited these
verses in my presence." The Buddha then repeated the verses in full.

When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, "Sir, that god
must surely have been Anāthapiṇḍika. For the householder
Anāthapiṇḍika was devoted to Venerable
Sāriputta."

"Good, good, Ānanda. You've reached the logical conclusion, as far as
logic goes. For that was indeed the god Anāthapiṇḍika."

## The Chapter on Various Sectarians

### N 2.21 With Shiva *Sivasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery.

Then, late at night, the glorious god Shiva, lighting up the entire
Jeta's Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and
recited these verses in the Buddha's presence:

> "Associate only with the virtuous!\
> Try to get close to the virtuous!\
> Understanding the true teaching of the good,\
> things get better, not worse.
>
> Associate only with the virtuous!\
> Try to get close to the virtuous!\
> Understanding the true teaching of the good,\
> wisdom is gained---but not from anyone else.
>
> Associate only with the virtuous!\
> Try to get close to the virtuous!\
> Understanding the true teaching of the good,\
> you grieve not among the grieving.
>
> Associate only with the virtuous!\
> Try to get close to the virtuous!\
> Understanding the true teaching of the good,\
> you shine among your relatives.
>
> Associate only with the virtuous!\
> Try to get close to the virtuous!\
> Understanding the true teaching of the good,\
> sentient beings go to a good place.
>
> Associate only with the virtuous!\
> Try to get close to the virtuous!\
> Understanding the true teaching of the good,\
> sentient beings live happily."

Then the Buddha replied to Shiva in verse:

> "Associate only with the virtuous!\
> Try to get close to the virtuous!\
> Understanding the true teaching of the good,\
> you're released from all suffering."

### N 2.22 With Khema *Khemasutta*

Standing to one side, the god Khema recited these verses in the Buddha's
presence:

> "Fools and simpletons behave\
> like their own worst enemies,\
> doing wicked deeds\
> that ripen as bitter fruit.
>
> It's not good to do a deed\
> that plagues you later on,\
> for which you weep and wail,\
> as its effect stays with you.
>
> It is good to do a deed\
> that doesn't plague you later on,\
> that gladdens and cheers,\
> as its effect stays with you."
>
> "As a precaution, you should do\
> what you know is for your own welfare.\
> A thinker, a wise one would not proceed\
> thinking like the cart driver.
>
> Suppose a cart driver leaves the highway,\
> so even and well compacted.\
> They enter upon a rough road,\
> and fret when their axle breaks.
>
> So too, a dullard departs the good\
> to follow what's against the good.\
> Fallen in the jaws of death,\
> they fret like their axle's broken."

### N 2.23 With Serī *Serīsutta*

Standing to one side, the god Serī addressed the Buddha in
verse:

> "Both gods and humans\
> enjoy their food.\
> So what's the name of the spirit\
> who doesn't like food?"
>
> "Those who give with faith\
> and a clear and confident heart,\
> partake of food\
> in this world and the next.
>
> So you should dispel stinginess,\
> overcoming that stain, and give a gift.\
> The good deeds of sentient beings\
> support them in the next world."

"It's incredible, sir, it's amazing, how well said this was by the
Buddha." He repeated the Buddha's verses, and said:

"Once upon a time, sir, I was a king named Serī, a giver, a
donor, who praised giving. I gave gifts at the four gates to ascetics
and brahmins, to paupers, vagrants, supplicants, and beggars. Then the
ladies of my harem approached me and said, 'Your Majesty gives gifts,
but we don't. Your Majesty, please support us to give gifts and make
merit.' Then it occurred to me, 'I'm a giver, a donor, who praises
giving. When they say, "We would give gifts", what am I to say?' And so
I gave the first gate to the ladies of my harem. There they gave gifts,
while my own giving dwindled.

Then my aristocrat vassals approached me and said, 'Your Majesty gives
gifts, the ladies of your harem give gifts, but we don't. Your Majesty,
please support us to give gifts and make merit.' Then it occurred to me,
'I'm a giver, a donor, who praises giving. When they say, "We would give
gifts", what am I to say?' And so I gave the second gate to my
aristocrat vassals. There they gave gifts, while my own giving dwindled.

Then my troops approached me and said, 'Your Majesty gives gifts, the
ladies of your harem give gifts, your aristocrat vassals give gifts, but
we don't. Your Majesty, please support us to give gifts and make merit.'
Then it occurred to me, 'I'm a giver, a donor, who praises giving. When
they say, "We would give gifts", what am I to say?' And so I gave the
third gate to my troops. There they gave gifts, while my own giving
dwindled.

Then my brahmins and householders approached me and said, 'Your Majesty
gives gifts, the ladies of your harem give gifts, your aristocrat
vassals give gifts, your troops give gifts, but we don't. Your Majesty,
please support us to give gifts and make merit.' Then it occurred to me,
'I'm a giver, a donor, who praises giving. When they say, "We would give
gifts", what am I to say?' And so I gave the fourth gate to my brahmins
and householders. There they gave gifts, while my own giving dwindled.

Then my men approached me and said, 'Now Your Majesty is not giving
gifts at all!' When they said this, I said to those men, 'So then, my
men, send half of the revenue from the outer districts to the royal
compound. Then give half right there to ascetics and brahmins, to
paupers, vagrants, supplicants, and beggars.' Sir, for a long time I
made so much merit and did so many skillful deeds. I never reached any
limit so as to say 'there's this much merit' or 'there's this much
result of merit' or 'for so long I'll remain in heaven'. It's
incredible, sir, it's amazing, how well said this was by the Buddha.

> 'Those who give with faith\
> and a clear and confident heart,\
> partake of food\
> in this world and the next.
>
> So you should dispel stinginess,\
> overcoming that stain, and give a gift.\
> The good deeds of sentient beings\
> support them in the next world.'"

### N 2.24 With Ghaṭīkāra *Ghaṭīkārasutta*

Standing to one side, the god Ghaṭīkāra recited this verse
in the Buddha's presence:

> "Seven mendicants reborn in Aviha\
> have been freed.\
> With the complete ending of greed and hate,\
> they've crossed over clinging to the world."
>
> "Who are those who've crossed the bog,\
> Death's dominion so hard to pass?\
> Who, after leaving behind the human body,\
> have risen above celestial yokes?"
>
> "Upaka and Palagaṇḍa,\
> and Pukkusāti, these three;\
> Bhaddiya and Bhaddadeva,\
> and Bāhudantī and Piṅgiya.\
> They, after leaving behind the human body,\
> have risen above celestial yokes."
>
> "You speak well of them,\
> who have let go the snares of Māra.\
> Whose teaching did they understand\
> to cut the bonds of rebirth?"
>
> "None other than the Blessed One!\
> None other than your instruction!\
> It was your teaching that they understood\
> to cut the bonds of rebirth.
>
> Where name and form\
> cease with nothing left over;\
> understanding this teaching,\
> they cut the bonds of rebirth."
>
> "The words you say are deep,\
> hard to understand, so very hard to wake up to.\
> Whose teaching did you understand\
> to be able to say such things?"
>
> "In the past I was a potter\
> in Vebhaliṅga called Ghaṭīkāra.\
> I took care of my parents\
> as a lay follower of Buddha Kassapa.
>
> I refrained from sexual intercourse,\
> I was celibate, spiritual.\
> We lived in the same village;\
> in the past I was your friend.
>
> I am the one who understands\
> that these seven mendicants have been freed.\
> With the complete ending of greed and hate,\
> they've crossed over clinging to the world."
>
> "That's exactly how it was,\
> just as you say, Bhaggava.\
> In the past you were a potter\
> in Vebhaliṅga called Ghaṭīkāra.
>
> You took care of your parents\
> as a lay follower of Buddha Kassapa.\
> You refrained from sexual intercourse,\
> you were celibate, spiritual.\
> We lived in the same village;\
> in the past you were my friend."
>
> "That's how it was\
> when those friends of old met again.\
> Both of them are evolved,\
> and bear their final body."

### N 2.25 With Jantu *Jantusutta*

So I have heard.

At one time several mendicants were staying in the Kosalan lands, in a
wilderness hut on the slopes of the Himalayas. They were restless,
insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking
situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds and
undisciplined faculties.

Then on the fifteenth day sabbath the god Jantu went up to those
mendicants and addressed them in verse:

> "The mendicants used to live happily,\
> as disciples of Gotama.\
> Desireless they sought alms;\
> desireless they used their lodgings.\
> Knowing that the world was impermanent\
> they made an end of suffering.
>
> But now they've made themselves hard to look after,\
> like chiefs in a village.\
> They eat and eat and then lie down,\
> unconscious in the homes of others.
>
> Having raised my joined palms to the Saṅgha,\
> I speak here only about certain people.\
> They're rejects, with no protector,\
> just like those who have passed away.
>
> I'm speaking about\
> those who live negligently.\
> To those who live diligently\
> I pay homage."

### N 2.26 With Rohitassa *Rohitassasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Standing to one side, the god Rohitassa said to the Buddha:

"Sir, is it possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by
traveling to a place where there's no being born, growing old, dying,
passing away, or being reborn?"

"Reverend, I say it's not possible to know or see or reach the end of
the world by traveling to a place where there's no being born, growing
old, dying, passing away, or being reborn."

"It's incredible, sir, it's amazing, how well said this was by the
Buddha.

Once upon a time, I was a seer called Rohitassa of the Bhoja people. I
was a sky-walker with psychic powers. I was as fast as a light arrow
easily shot across the shadow of a palm tree by a well-trained expert
archer with a strong bow. My stride was such that it could span from the
eastern ocean to the western ocean. This wish came to me: 'I will reach
the end of the world by traveling.' Having such speed and stride, I
traveled for my whole lifespan of a hundred years---pausing only to eat
and drink, go to the toilet, and sleep to dispel weariness---and I
passed away along the way, never reaching the end of the world.

It's incredible, sir, it's amazing, how well said this was by the
Buddha. 'Reverend, I say it's not possible to know or see or reach the
end of the world by traveling to a place where there's no being born,
growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.'"

"But Reverend, I also say there's no making an end of suffering without
reaching the end of the world. For it is in this fathom-long carcass
with its perception and mind that I describe the world, its origin, its
cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation.

> The end of the world can never\
> be reached by traveling.\
> But without reaching the end of the world,\
> there's no release from suffering.
>
> So an intelligent person, understanding the world,\
> has completed the spiritual journey\
> \>and gone to the end of the world.\
> A calm one, knowing the end of the world,\
> does not hope for this world or the next."

### N 2.27 With Nanda *Nandasutta*

Standing to one side, the god Nanda recited this verse in the Buddha's
presence:

> "Time flies, nights pass by,\
> the stages of life leave us one by one.\
> Seeing this peril in death,\
> do good deeds that bring you joy."
>
> "Time flies, nights pass by,\
> the stages of life leave us one by one.\
> Seeing this peril in death,\
> one looking for peace would drop the world's bait."

### N 2.28 With Nandivisāla *Nandivisālasutta*

Standing to one side, the god Nandivisāla addressed the
Buddha in verse:

> "Four are its wheels, and nine its doors;\
> it's stuffed full, bound with greed,\
> and born from a bog.\
> Great hero, how am I supposed to live like this?"
>
> "Having cut the strap and harness---\
> wicked desire and greed---\
> and having plucked out craving, root and all:\
> that's how you're supposed to live like this."

### N 2.29 With Susīma *Susimasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one
side. The Buddha said to him, "Ānanda, do you endorse
Sāriputta?"

"Sir, who on earth would not endorse Venerable Sāriputta
unless they're a fool, a hater, delusional, or mentally deranged?
Venerable Sāriputta is astute, he has great wisdom,
widespread wisdom, laughing wisdom, swift wisdom, sharp wisdom, and
penetrating wisdom. He has few wishes, he's content, secluded, aloof,
and energetic. He gives advice and accepts advice; he accuses and
criticizes wickedness. Who on earth would not endorse Venerable
Sāriputta unless they're a fool, a hater, delusional, or
mentally deranged?"

"That's so true, Ānanda! That's so true! Who on earth would not endorse
Venerable Sāriputta unless they're a fool, a hater,
delusional, or mentally deranged?" And the Buddha repeated all of
Ānanda's terms of praise.

While this praise of Sāriputta was being spoken, the god
Susīma approached the Buddha, escorted by a large assembly
of gods. He bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:

"That's so true, Blessed One! That's so true, Holy One! Who on earth
would not endorse Venerable Sāriputta unless they're a
fool, a hater, delusional, or mentally deranged?" And he too repeated
all the terms of praise of Sāriputta, adding, "For I too,
sir, whenever I go to an assembly of gods, frequently hear the same
terms of praise."

While this praise of Sāriputta was being spoken, the gods
of Susīma's assembly---uplifted and overjoyed, full of
rapture and happiness---generated a rainbow of bright colors.

Suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful,
eight-faceted, well-worked. When placed on a cream rug it would shine
and glow and radiate. In the same way, the gods of Susīma's
assembly generated a rainbow of bright colors.

Suppose there was a pendant of Black Plum River gold, fashioned by a
deft smith, well wrought in the forge. When placed on a cream rug it
would shine and glow and radiate. In the same way, the gods of
Susīma's assembly generated a rainbow of bright colors.

Suppose that in the autumn the heavens were clear and cloudless. At the
crack of dawn, the Morning Star shines and glows and radiates. In the
same way, the gods of Susīma's assembly generated a rainbow
of bright colors.

Suppose that in the autumn the heavens were clear and cloudless. As the
sun is rising to the firmament, having dispelled all the darkness of
space, shines and glows and radiates. In the same way, the gods of
Susīma's assembly generated a rainbow of bright colors.

Then the god Susīma recited this verse about Venerable
Sāriputta in the Buddha's presence:

> "He's considered astute,\
> Sāriputta, free of anger.\
> Few in wishes, sweet, tamed,\
> the seer shines in the Teacher's praise!"

Then the Buddha replied to Susīma with this verse about
Venerable Sāriputta:

> "He's considered astute,\
> Sāriputta, free of anger.\
> Few in wishes, sweet, tamed;\
> developed and well-tamed, he awaits his time."

### N 2.30 The Disciples of Various Monastics of Other Religions *Nānātitthiyasāvakasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding
ground.

Then, late at night, several glorious gods lit up the entire Bamboo
Grove. They were Asama, Sahalī, Niṅka,
Ākoṭaka, Vetambarī, and
Māṇavagāmiya, and all of them were disciples of various
monastics of other religions. They went up to the Buddha, bowed, and
stood to one side.

Standing to one side, the god Asama recited this verse about
Pūraṇa Kassapa in the Buddha's presence:

> "In injuring and killing here,\
> in beating and extortion,\
> Kassapa saw no evil,\
> nor any merit for oneself.\
> What he taught should truly be trusted,\
> he's worthy of esteem as Teacher."

Then the god Sahalī recited this verse about the
bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla in the Buddha's presence:

> "Through fervent mortification in disgust of sin he became well
> restrained.\
> He gave up arguing with people.\
> Refraining from false speech, he spoke the truth.\
> Surely such a man does no wrong!"

Then the god Niṅka recited this verse about the Jain
ascetic of the Ñātika clan in the Buddha's presence:

> "Disgusted at sin, an alert mendicant,\
> well restrained in the fourfold constraint;\
> explaining what is seen and heard:\
> surely he can be no sinner!"

Then the god Ākoṭaka recited this verse about various
sectarian teachers in the Buddha's presence:

> "Pakudhaka, Kātiyāna, and Nigaṇṭha,\
> as well as this bamboo-staffed ascetic and Pūraṇa:\
> Teachers of communities, attained ascetics,\
> surely they weren't far from truly good men!"

Then the god Vetambarī replied to the god
Ākoṭaka in verse:

> "Though the wretched jackal howls along,\
> it never equals the lion.\
> A naked liar with suspicious conduct,\
> though they teach a community, is not like the good."

Then Māra the Wicked took possession of the god
Vetambarī and recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "Those dedicated to mortification in disgust of sin,\
> safeguarding their seclusion,\
> attached to form,\
> they rejoice in the heavenly realm.\
> Indeed, those mortals give correct instructions\
> regarding the next world."

Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked,
replied to him in verse:

> "Whatever forms there are\
> \>in this world or the world beyond,\
> and those of shining beauty in the sky,\
> all of these you praise, Namuci,\
> like bait tossed out for catching fish."

Then the god Māṇavagāmiya recited this verse about the
Buddha in his presence:

> "Of all the mountains of Rājagaha,\
> Vipula's said to be the best.\
> Seta is the best of the Himalayan peaks,\
> and the sun, of travelers in space.
>
> The ocean is the best of seas,\
> and the moon, of lights that shine at night.\
> But in all the world with its gods,\
> the Buddha is declared foremost."


# Linked Discourses With King Pasenadi of Kosala

## Chapter One

### N 3.1 Young *Daharasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery.

Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, and exchanged
greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were
over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, "Does the worthy
Gotama claim to have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening?"

"If anyone should rightly be said to have awakened to the supreme
perfect awakening, it's me. For, great king, I have awakened to the
supreme perfect awakening."

"Well, there are those ascetics and brahmins who lead an order and a
community, and tutor a community. They're well-known and famous
religious founders, deemed holy by many people. That is,
Pūraṇa Kassapa, the bamboo-staffed ascetic
Gosāla, the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan,
Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, Pakudha
Kaccāyana, and Ajita of the hair blanket. I also asked them
whether they claimed to have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening,
but they made no such claim. So why do you, given that you're so young
in age and newly gone forth?"

"Great king, these four things should not be looked down upon or
disparaged because they are young. What four? An aristocrat, a serpent,
a fire, and a mendicant. These four things should not be looked down
upon or disparaged because they are young."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "A man should not despise\
> an aristocrat of impeccable lineage,\
> high-born and famous,\
> just because they're young.
>
> For it's possible that that lord of men,\
> as aristocrat, will gain the throne.\
> And in his anger he'll execute a royal punishment,\
> and have you violently beaten.\
> Hence you should avoid him\
> for the sake of your own life.
>
> Whether in village or wilderness,\
> wherever a serpent is seen,\
> a man should not look down on it\
> or despise it for its youth.
>
> With its rainbow of colors,\
> the serpent of fiery breath glides along.\
> It lashes out and bites the fool,\
> both men and women alike.\
> Hence you should avoid it\
> for the sake of your own life.
>
> A fire devours a huge amount,\
> a conflagration with a blackened trail.\
> A man should not look down on it\
> just because it's young.
>
> For once it gets fuel\
> it'll become a huge conflagration.\
> It'll lash out and burn the fool,\
> both men and women alike.\
> Hence you should avoid it\
> for the sake of your own life.
>
> When a forest is burned by fire,\
> a conflagration with a blackened trail,\
> the shoots will spring up there again,\
> with the passing of the days and nights.
>
> But if a mendicant endowed with ethics\
> burns you with their power,\
> you'll have no sons or cattle,\
> nor will your heirs find wealth.\
> Childless and heirless you become,\
> like a palm-tree stump.
>
> That's why an astute person,\
> seeing what's good for themselves,\
> would always treat these properly:\
> a snake, a conflagration,\
> a famous aristocrat,\
> and a mendicant endowed with ethics."

When this was said, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Buddha,
"Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or
revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting
a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what's there, the
Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the
Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From
this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has
gone for refuge for life."

### N 3.2 A Person *Purisasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to
one side, and said to the Buddha, "Sir, how many things arise inside a
person for their harm, suffering, and discomfort?"

"Great king, three things arise inside a person for their harm,
suffering, and discomfort. What three? Greed, hate, and delusion. These
three things arise inside a person for their harm, suffering, and
discomfort."

That is what the Buddha said. ...

> "When greed, hate, and delusion,\
> have arisen inside oneself,\
> they harm a person of wicked heart,\
> as a reed is destroyed by its own fruit."

### N 3.3 Old Age and Death *Jarāmaraṇasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, "Sir, for someone
who has been reborn, is there any exemption from old age and death?"

"Great king, for someone who has been reborn, there's no exemption from
old age and death. Even for well-to-do aristocrats, brahmins, or
householders---rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and
silver, lots of property and assets, and lots of money and grain---when
they're born, there's no exemption from old age and death. Even for
mendicants who are perfected---who have ended the defilements, completed
the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden,
achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued
existence, and are rightly freed through enlightenment---their bodies
are liable to break up and be laid to rest."

That is what the Buddha said. ...

> "Fancy chariots of kings wear out,\
> and even this body gets old.\
> But the truth of the good never gets old---\
> so the good proclaim to the good."

### N 3.4 Loved *Piyasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, "Just now, sir, as
I was in private retreat this thought came to mind. 'Who are those who
love themselves? And who are those who don't love themselves?'

Then it occurred to me: 'Those who do bad things by way of body, speech,
and mind don't love themselves. Even though they may say: "I love
myself", they don't really. Why is that? It's because they treat
themselves like an enemy. That's why they don't love themselves.

Those who do good things by way of body, speech, and mind do love
themselves. Even though they may say: "I don't love myself", they do
really. Why is that? It's because they treat themselves like a loved
one. That's why they do love themselves.'"

"That's so true, great king! That's so true!" said the Buddha. And he
repeated the king's statement, adding:

> "If you knew your self as beloved,\
> you'd not yoke yourself to wickedness.\
> For happiness is not easy to find\
> by someone who does bad deeds.
>
> When you're seized by the terminator\
> as you give up your human life,\
> what can you call your own?\
> What do you take when you go?\
> What goes with you,\
> like a shadow that never leaves?
>
> Both the good and the bad\
> that a mortal does in this life\
> is what they can call their own.\
> That's what they take when they go.\
> That's what goes with them,\
> like a shadow that never leaves.
>
> That's why you should do good,\
> investing in the future life.\
> The good deeds of sentient beings\
> support them in the next world."

### N 3.5 Self-Protected *Attarakkhitasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, "Just now, sir, as
I was in private retreat this thought came to mind. 'Who are those who
protect themselves? And who are those who don't protect themselves?'

Then it occurred to me: 'Those who do bad things by way of body, speech,
and mind don't protect themselves. Even if they're protected by a
company of elephants, cavalry, chariots, or infantry, they still don't
protect themselves. Why is that? Because such protection is exterior,
not interior. That's why they don't protect themselves.

Those who do good things by way of body, speech, and mind do protect
themselves. Even if they're not protected by a company of elephants,
cavalry, chariots, or infantry, they still protect themselves. Why is
that? Because such protection is interior, not exterior. That's why they
do protect themselves.'"

"That's so true, great king! That's so true!" said the Buddha. And he
repeated the king's statement, adding:

> "Restraint of the body is good;\
> restraint of speech is good;\
> restraint of mind is good;\
> everywhere, restraint is good.\
> A sincere person, restrained everywhere,\
> is said to be 'protected'."

### N 3.6 Few *Appakasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, "Just now, sir, as
I was in private retreat this thought came to mind: 'Few are the
sentient beings in the world who, when they obtain luxury possessions,
don't get indulgent and negligent, giving in to greed for sensual
pleasures, and doing the wrong thing by others. There are many more who,
when they obtain luxury possessions, do get indulgent and negligent,
giving in to greed for sensual pleasures, and doing the wrong thing by
others.'"

"That's so true, great king! That's so true!" said the Buddha. And he
repeated the king's statement, adding:

> "Full of desire for possessions and pleasures,\
> greedy, infatuated by sensual pleasures;\
> they don't notice that they've gone too far,\
> like deer falling into a trap set out.\
> It'll be bitter later on;\
> for the result will be bad for them."

### N 3.7 Judgment *Aḍḍakaraṇasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, "Sir, when I'm
sitting in judgment I see well-to-do aristocrats, brahmins, and
householders---rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and
silver, lots of property and assets, and lots of money and grain. But
they tell deliberate lies for the sake of sensual pleasures. Then it
occurred to me: 'Enough with passing judgment today. Now my dearest will
be known by the judgments he makes.'"

"That's so true, great king! That's so true! Those who are well-to-do
aristocrats, brahmins, and householders tell deliberate lies for the
sake of sensual pleasures. That is for their lasting harm and
suffering."

That is what the Buddha said. ...

> "Full of desire for possessions and pleasures,\
> greedy, infatuated by sensual pleasures;\
> they don't notice that they've gone too far,\
> like fish entering a net set out.\
> It'll be bitter later on;\
> for the result will be bad for them."

### N 3.8 With Queen Mallikā *Mallikāsutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala was upstairs in the royal
longhouse together with Queen Mallikā.

Then the king said to the queen, "Mallikā, is there anyone
more dear to you than yourself?"

"No, great king, there isn't. But is there anyone more dear to you than
yourself?"

"For me also, Mallikā, there's no-one."

Then King Pasenadi of Kosala came downstairs from the stilt longhouse,
went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had
happened.

Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha recited
this verse:

> "Having explored every quarter with the mind,\
> one finds no-one dearer than oneself.\
> Likewise for others, each holds themselves dear;\
> so one who cares for their own welfare would harm no other."

### N 3.9 Sacrifice *Yaññasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time a big sacrifice had been set up for King Pasenadi of
Kosala. Bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats and rams---five hundred of
each---had been led to the pillar for the sacrifice. His bondservants,
servants, and workers did their jobs under threat of punishment and
danger, weeping with tearful faces.

Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls
and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. Then, after the meal,
when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed,
sat down to one side, and told him what was happening.

Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha recited
these verses:

> "Horse sacrifice, human sacrifice,\
> the sacrifices of the 'casting of the yoke-pin',\
> the 'royal soma drinking', and the 'unimpeded'---\
> these huge violent sacrifices yield no great fruit.
>
> The great sages of right comportment\
> don't attend sacrifices\
> where goats, sheep, and cattle\
> and various creatures are killed.
>
> But the great sages of right comportment\
> do attend non-violent sacrifices\
> of regular family tradition,\
> where goats, sheep, and cattle,\
> and various creatures aren't killed.
>
> A clever person should sacrifice like this,\
> for this sacrifice is very fruitful.\
> For a sponsor of sacrifices like this,\
> things get better, not worse.\
> Such a sacrifice is truly abundant,\
> and even the deities are pleased."

### N 3.10 Shackles *Bandhanasutta*

Now at that time a large group of people had been put in shackles by
King Pasenadi of Kosala---some in ropes, some in manacles, some in
chains.

Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls
and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. Then, after the meal,
when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed,
sat down to one side, and told him what was happening.

Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha recited
these verses:

> "The attentive say that shackle is not strong\
> that's made of iron, wood, or knots.\
> But obsession with jeweled earrings,\
> concern for your partners and children:
>
> this, say the attentive, is a strong shackle\
> dragging the indulgent down, hard to escape.\
> Having cut this one too they go forth,\
> unconcerned, having given up sensual pleasures."

## Chapter Two

### N 3.11 Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics *Sattajaṭilasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the
stilt longhouse of Migāra's mother in the Eastern
Monastery.

Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and sat
outside the gate. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha,
bowed, and sat down to one side.

Now at that time seven matted-hair ascetics, seven Jain ascetics, seven
naked ascetics, seven one-cloth ascetics, and seven wanderers passed by
not far from the Buddha. Their armpits and bodies were hairy, and their
nails were long; and they carried their stuff with shoulder-poles.

Then King Pasenadi got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one
shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground, raised his joined
palms toward those various ascetics, and pronounced his name three
times: "Sirs, I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala! ... I am Pasenadi, king of
Kosala!"

Then, soon after those ascetics had left, King Pasenadi went up to the
Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, "Sir, are they
among those in the world who are perfected ones or who are on the path
to perfection?"

"Great king, as a layman enjoying sensual pleasures, living at home with
your children, using sandalwood imported from Kāsi, wearing
garlands, fragrance, and makeup, and accepting gold and currency, it's
hard for you to know who is perfected or on the path to perfection.

You can get to know a person's ethics by living with them. But only
after a long time, not casually; only when attentive, not when
inattentive; and only by the wise, not the witless. You can get to know
a person's purity by dealing with them. ... You can get to know a
person's resilience in times of trouble. ... You can get to know a
person's wisdom by discussion. But only after a long time, not casually;
only when attentive, not when inattentive; and only by the wise, not the
witless."

"It's incredible, sir, it's amazing, how well said this was by the
Buddha. ...

Sir, these are my spies, my undercover agents returning after spying on
the country. First they go undercover, then I have them report to me.
And now---when they have washed off the dust and dirt, and are nicely
bathed and anointed, with hair and beard dressed, and dressed in
white---they will amuse themselves, supplied and provided with the five
kinds of sensual stimulation."

Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha recited
these verses:

> "It's not easy to know a man by his appearance.\
> You shouldn't trust them at first sight.\
> For undisciplined men live in this world\
> disguised as the disciplined.
>
> Like a fake earring made of clay,\
> like a copper halfpenny covered with gold,\
> they live hidden in the world,\
> corrupt inside but impressive outside."

### N 3.12 Five Kings *Pañcarājasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time five kings headed by Pasenadi were amusing themselves,
supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, and
this discussion came up among them: "What's the best of sensual
pleasures?"

Some of them said, "Sights are the best of sensual pleasures!"

Others said, "Sounds are best!"

Others said, "Smells are best!"

Others said, "Tastes are best!"

Others said, "Touches are best!"

Since those kings were unable to persuade each other, King Pasenadi said
to them, "Come, good fellows, let's go to the Buddha and ask him about
this. As he answers, so we'll remember it."

"Yes, dear sir," replied those kings.

Then those five kings headed by Pasenadi went to the Buddha, bowed, and
sat down to one side. King Pasenadi reported their conversation to the
Buddha, and said, "Sir, what's the best of sensual pleasures?"

"Great king, which kind of sensual stimulation is best is defined by
which is most agreeable, I say. The very same sights that are agreeable
to some are disagreeable to others. When you're happy with certain
sights, as you've got all you wished for, you don't want any other sight
that's better or finer. For you, those sights are perfect and supreme.

The very same sounds ... smells ... tastes ... touches that are
agreeable to some are disagreeable to others. When you're happy with
certain touches, as you've got all you wished for, you don't want any
other touch that's better or finer. For you, those touches are perfect
and supreme."

Now at that time the lay follower Candanaṅgalika was
sitting in that assembly. Then he got up from his seat, arranged his
robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and
said, "I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak,
Holy One!"

"Then speak as you feel inspired," said the Buddha.

Then the lay follower Candanaṅgalika extolled the Buddha in
his presence with an appropriate verse:

> "Like a fragrant pink lotus\
> that blooms in the morning, its fragrance unfaded---\
> see Aṅgīrasa shine,\
> bright as the sun in the sky!"

Then those five kings clothed Candanaṅgalika with five
upper robes. And Candanaṅgalika in turn endowed the Buddha
with those robes.

### N 3.13 A Bucket of Rice *Doṇapākasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala used to eat rice by the pot.
Then after eating King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, huffing
and puffing. He bowed and sat down to one side.

Then, knowing that King Pasenadi was huffing and puffing after eating,
on that occasion the Buddha recited this verse:

> "When a man is always mindful,\
> knowing moderation in eating,\
> his discomfort fades,\
> and he ages slowly, taking care of his life."

Now at that time the student Sudassana was standing behind the king.
Then King Pasenadi addressed him, "Please, dear Sudassana, memorize this
verse in the Buddha's presence and recite it to me whenever I am
presented with a meal. I'll set up a regular daily allowance of a
hundred dollars for you."

"Yes, Your Majesty," replied Sudassana. He memorized that verse in the
Buddha's presence, and then whenever the king was presented with a meal
he would repeat it:

> "When a man is always mindful,\
> knowing moderation in eating,\
> his discomfort fades,\
> and he ages slowly, taking care of his life."

Then the king gradually got used to having at most a cup of rice. After
some time King Pasenadi's body slimmed right down. Stroking his limbs
with his hands, at that time he expressed this heartfelt sentiment:

"In both ways the Buddha has sympathy for me: in the good of this life
and the good of the next."

### N 3.14 Battle (1st) *Paṭhamasaṅgāmasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of
Videha, mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to
Kāsi to attack King Pasenadi of Kosala. When King Pasenadi
heard of this, he mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to
Kāsi to defend it against Ajātasattu. Then the
two kings met in battle. And in that battle Ajātasattu
defeated Pasenadi, who withdrew to his own capital at
Sāvatthī.

Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls
and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. Then, after the meal,
when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed,
sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then the Buddha
said:

"Mendicants, King Ajātasattu has bad friends, companions,
and associates. But King Pasenadi has good friends, companions, and
associates. Yet on this day King Pasenadi will have a bad night's sleep
as one defeated."

That is what the Buddha said. ...

> "Victory breeds enmity;\
> the defeated sleep badly.\
> The peaceful sleep at ease,\
> having left victory and defeat behind."

### N 3.15 Battle (2nd) *Dutiyasaṅgāmasutta*

Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of
Videha, mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to
Kāsi to attack King Pasenadi of Kosala. When King Pasenadi
heard of this, he mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to
Kāsi to defend it against Ajātasattu. Then the
two kings met in battle. And in that battle Pasenadi defeated
Ajātasattu and captured him alive.

Then King Pasenadi thought, "Even though I've never betrayed this King
Ajātasattu, he betrayed me. Still, he is my nephew. Now
that I've vanquished all of Ajātasattu's elephant troops,
cavalry, chariots, and infantry, why don't I let him loose with just his
life?"

And that's what he did.

Then several mendicants ... told the Buddha what had happened.

Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha recited
these verses:

> "A man goes on plundering\
> as long as it serves his ends.\
> But as soon as others plunder him,\
> the plunderer is plundered.
>
> For the fool thinks they've got away with it\
> so long as their wickedness has not ripened.\
> But as soon as that wickedness ripens,\
> they fall into suffering.
>
> A killer creates a killer;\
> a conqueror creates a conqueror;\
> an abuser creates abuse,\
> and a bully creates a bully.\
> And so as deeds unfold\
> the plunderer is plundered."

### N 3.16 A Daughter *Mallikāsutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down
to one side. Then a man went up to the king and whispered in his ear,
"Your Majesty, Queen Mallikā has given birth to a
daughter." When this was said, King Pasenadi was disappointed.

Then, knowing that King Pasenadi was disappointed, on that occasion the
Buddha recited these verses:

> "Well, some women are better than men,\
> O ruler of the people.\
> Wise and virtuous,\
> a devoted wife who honors her mother in law.
>
> And when she has a son,\
> he becomes a hero, O lord of the land.\
> The son of such a blessed lady\
> may even rule the realm."

### N 3.17 Diligence *Appamādasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, "Sir, is there one
thing that secures benefits for both this life and lives to come?"

"There is, great king."

"So what is that one thing?"

"Diligence, great king, is one thing that secures benefits for both this
life and lives to come. The footprints of all creatures that walk can
fit inside an elephant's footprint. So an elephant's footprint is said
to be the biggest of them all. In the same way, diligence is one thing
that secures benefits for both this life and lives to come."

That is what the Buddha said. ...

> "For one who desires a continuous flow\
> of exceptional delights---\
> long life, beauty, and health,\
> heaven, and birth in an eminent family---
>
> the astute praise diligence\
> in making merit.\
> Being diligent, an astute person\
> secures both benefits:
>
> the benefit in this life,\
> and in lives to come.\
> An attentive one, comprehending the meaning,\
> is said to be astute."

### N 3.18 Good Friends *Kalyāṇamittasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, "Just now, sir, as
I was in private retreat this thought came to mind. 'The teaching is
well explained by the Buddha. But it's for someone with good friends,
companions, and associates, not for someone with bad friends,
companions, and associates.'"

"That's so true, great king! That's so true!" said the Buddha. And he
repeated the king's statement, adding:

"Great king, this one time I was staying in the land of the Sakyans
where they have a town named Townsville. Then the mendicant Ānanda came
to me, bowed, sat down to one side, and said: 'Sir, good friends,
companions, and associates are half the spiritual life.'

When he had spoken, I said to him: 'Not so, Ānanda! Not so, Ānanda! Good
friends, companions, and associates are the whole of the spiritual life.
A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to
develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path.

And how does a mendicant with good friends develop and cultivate the
noble eightfold path? It's when a mendicant develops right view, right
thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort,
right mindfulness, and right immersion, which rely on seclusion, fading
away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. That's how a mendicant
with good friends develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path. And
here's another way to understand how good friends are the whole of the
spiritual life.

For, by relying on me as a good friend, sentient beings who are liable
to rebirth, old age, and death, to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness,
and distress are freed from all these things. This is another way to
understand how good friends are the whole of the spiritual life.'

So, great king, you should train like this: 'I will have good friends,
companions, and associates.' That's how you should train.

When you have good friends, companions, and associates, you should live
supported by one thing: diligence in skillful qualities.

When you're diligent, supported by diligence, your ladies of the harem,
aristocrat vassals, troops, and people of town and country will think:
'The king lives diligently, supported by diligence. We'd better live
diligently, supported by diligence!'

When you're diligent, supported by diligence, then not only you
yourself, but your ladies of the harem, and your treasury and
storehouses will be guarded and protected."

That is what the Buddha said. ...

> "For one who desires a continuous flow\
> of exceptional wealth,\
> the astute praise diligence\
> in making merit.\
> Being diligent, an astute person\
> secures both benefits:
>
> the benefit in this life,\
> and in lives to come.\
> Attentive, comprehending the meaning,\
> they are said to be astute."

### N 3.19 Childless (1st) *Paṭhamaaputtakasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha in the middle of the
day, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, "So, great
king, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?"

"Sir, here in Sāvatthī a financier householder has passed
away. Since he died childless, I have come after transferring his
fortune to the royal compound. There was eight million in gold coin, not
to mention the silver coin. And yet that financier ate meals of rough
gruel with pickles. He wore clothes consisting of three pieces of sunn
hemp. He traveled around in a vehicle that was a dilapidated little
cart, holding a leaf as sunshade."

"That's so true, great king! That's so true! When an untrue person has
acquired exceptional wealth they don't make themselves happy and
pleased. Nor do they make their mother and father, partners and
children, bondservants, workers, and staff, and friends and colleagues
happy and pleased. And they don't establish an uplifting religious
donation for ascetics and brahmins that's conducive to heaven, ripens in
happiness, and leads to heaven. Because they haven't made proper use of
that wealth, rulers or bandits take it, or fire consumes it, or flood
sweeps it away, or unloved heirs take it. Since that wealth is not
properly utilized, it's wasted, not used.

Suppose there was a lotus pond in an uninhabited region with clear,
sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful. But people
don't collect it or drink it or bathe in it or use it for any purpose.
Since that water is not properly utilized, it's wasted, not used.

In the same way, when an untrue person has acquired exceptional wealth
... it's wasted, not used.

When a true person has acquired exceptional wealth they make themselves
happy and pleased. And they make their mother and father, partners and
children, bondservants, workers, and staff, and friends and colleagues
happy and pleased. And they establish an uplifting religious donation
for ascetics and brahmins that's conducive to heaven, ripens in
happiness, and leads to heaven. Because they make proper use of that
wealth, rulers or bandits don't take it, fire doesn't consume it, flood
doesn't sweep it away, and unloved heirs don't take it. Since that
wealth is properly utilized, it's used, not wasted.

Suppose there was a lotus pond not far from a town or village with
clear, sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful. And
people collected it and drank it and bathed in it and used it for their
own purpose. Since that water is properly utilized, it's used, not
wasted.

In the same way, when a true person has acquired exceptional wealth ...
it's used, not wasted.

> As cool water in an uninhabited region\
> evaporates when not drunk;\
> so too when a sinner acquires wealth,\
> they neither use it themselves nor give it away.
>
> But when an attentive and sensible person gets hold of wealth,\
> they use it and do their duty.\
> That head, having supported the family unit,\
> blameless, goes to a heavenly place."

### N 3.20 Childless (2nd) *Dutiyaaputtakasutta*

Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha in the middle of the
day ... The Buddha said to him, "So, great king, where are you coming
from in the middle of the day?"

"Sir, here in Sāvatthī a financier householder has passed
away. Since he died childless, I have come after transferring his
fortune to the royal compound. There was ten million in gold coin, not
to mention the silver coin. And yet that financier ate meals of rough
gruel with pickles. He wore clothes consisting of three pieces of sunn
hemp. He traveled around in a vehicle that was a dilapidated little
cart, holding a leaf as sunshade."

"That's so true, great king! That's so true! Once upon a time, great
king, that financier householder provided almsfood on behalf of an
independent Buddha named Tagarasikhī. He instructed: 'Give
alms to that ascetic,' before getting up from his seat and leaving. But
after giving he regretted it: 'It would have been better to feed the
bondservants or workers with that almsfood.' What's more, he murdered
his brother's only child for the sake of his fortune.

Because that financier provided Tagarasikhī with almsfood,
as a result of that deed he was reborn seven times in a good place, a
heavenly realm. And as a residual result of that same deed he held the
position of financier seven times right here in Sāvatthī.
But because that financier regretted giving alms, as a result of that
deed his mind didn't tend to enjoy nice food, clothes, vehicles, or the
five refined kinds of sensual stimulation. And because that financier
murdered his brother's only child for the sake of his fortune, as a
result of that deed he burned in hell for many years, for many hundreds,
many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of years. And as a residual
result of that same deed, he is childless for the seventh time, his
fortune ending up in the royal treasury. Now the old merit of that
financier has been used up, and he hasn't accumulated new merit. Today,
great king, that financier burns in the Great Hell of Screams."

"Really, sir, that financier has been reborn in the Great Hell of
Screams?"

"Yes he has, great king."

That is what the Buddha said. ...

> "Grain, money, silver, and gold,\
> or whatever other possessions there are;\
> bondservants, workers, servants,\
> and those dependent for their livelihood:
>
> you must go on without taking these;\
> all of them are left behind.\
> But the deeds you do\
> by body, speech, and mind---
>
> that's what you can call your own.\
> That's what you take when you go.\
> That's what goes with you,\
> like a shadow that never leaves.
>
> That's why you should do good,\
> investing in the future life.\
> The good deeds of sentient beings\
> support them in the next world."

## Chapter Three

### N 3.21 Persons *Puggalasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down
to one side. The Buddha said to him:

"Great king, these four people are found in the world. What four?

1.  The dark bound for darkness,

2.  the dark bound for light,

3.  the light bound for darkness,

4.  and the light bound for light.

And how is a person dark and bound for darkness? It's when a person is
reborn in a low family---a family of corpse-workers, bamboo-workers,
hunters, chariot-makers, or scavengers---poor, with little to eat or
drink, where life is tough, and food and shelter are hard to find. And
they're ugly, unsightly, deformed, sickly---one-eyed, crippled, lame, or
half-paralyzed. They don't get to have food, drink, clothes, and
vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; or bed, house, and lighting.
And they do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body
breaks up, after death, they're reborn in a place of loss, a bad place,
the underworld, hell.

This person is like someone who goes from darkness to darkness, from
blackness to blackness, from bloodstain to bloodstain. That's how a
person is dark and bound for darkness.

And how is a person dark and bound for light? It's when a person is
reborn in a low family---a family of corpse-workers, bamboo-workers,
hunters, chariot-makers, or scavengers---poor, with little to eat or
drink, where life is tough, and food and shelter are hard to find. And
they're ugly, unsightly, deformed, sickly---one-eyed, crippled, lame, or
half-paralyzed. They don't get to have food, drink, clothes, and
vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; or bed, house, and lighting.
But they do good things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their
body breaks up, after death, they're reborn in a good place, a heavenly
realm.

This person is like someone who ascends from the ground to a couch; from
a couch to horseback; from horseback to an elephant; and from an
elephant to a stilt longhouse. That's how a person is dark and bound for
light.

And how is a person light and bound for darkness? It's when a person is
reborn in an eminent family---a well-to-do family of aristocrats,
brahmins, or householders---rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of
gold and silver, lots of property and assets, and lots of money and
grain. And they're attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing
beauty. They get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands,
fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. But they do bad
things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body breaks up,
after death, they're reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the
underworld, hell.

This person is like someone who descends from a stilt longhouse to an
elephant; from an elephant to horseback; from horseback to a couch; and
from a couch to the ground; and from the ground they enter darkness.
That's how a person is light and bound for darkness.

And how is a person light and bound for light? It's when a person is
reborn in an eminent family---a well-to-do family of aristocrats,
brahmins, or householders---rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of
gold and silver, lots of property and assets, and lots of money and
grain. And they're attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing
beauty. They get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands,
fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. And they do good
things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body breaks up,
after death, they're reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.

This person is like someone who shifts from one couch to another; from
the back of one horse to another; from one elephant to another; or from
one stilt longhouse to another. That's how a person is light and bound
for light. These are the four people found in the world."

That is what the Buddha said. ...

> "O king, some people are poor,\
> faithless and stingy.\
> Miserly, with bad intentions,\
> they lack regard, they have wrong view.
>
> They abuse and insult\
> ascetics and brahmins\
> and other supplicants.\
> They're nihilists and bullies,
>
> who prevent others from giving\
> food to beggars.\
> O king, ruler of the people:\
> when such people die\
> they fall into the terrible hell---\
> from darkness they're bound for darkness.
>
> O king, some people are poor,\
> but faithful and not stingy.\
> They give with best of intentions,\
> that peaceful-hearted person.
>
> They rise for and bow to\
> ascetics and brahmins\
> and other supplicants.\
> Training in moral conduct,
>
> they don't prevent others from giving\
> food to beggars.\
> O king, ruler of the people:\
> when such people die\
> they go to the heaven of the Three and Thirty---\
> from darkness they're bound for light.
>
> O king, some people are rich,\
> but faithless and stingy.\
> Miserly, with bad intentions,\

> they don't prevent others from giving\

> O king, ruler of the people:\
> when such people die\
> they go to the heaven of the Three and Thirty---\
> from light they're bound for light."

### N 3.22 Grandmother *Ayyikāsutta*

At Sāvatthī.

King Pasenadi of Kosala sat to one side, and the Buddha said to him,
"So, great king, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?"

"Sir, my grandmother has passed away. She was old, elderly and senior.
She was advanced in years and had reached the final stage of life; she
was a hundred and twenty years old. But I loved my grandmother; she was
dear to me. If by giving away the elephant-treasure I could get my
grandmother back, I'd do it. If by giving away the horse-treasure I
could get my grandmother back, I'd do it. If by giving away a prize
village I could get my grandmother back, I'd do it. If by giving away
the whole country I could get my grandmother back, I'd do it."

"Great king, all sentient beings are liable to die. Death is their end;
they're not exempt from death."

"It's incredible, sir, it's amazing, how well said this was by the
Buddha: 'All sentient beings are liable to die. Death is their end;
they're not exempt from death.'"

"That's so true, great king! That's so true! All sentient beings are
liable to die. Death is their end; they're not exempt from death. It's
like the vessels made by potters. Whatever kind they are, whether baked
or unbaked, all of them are liable to break apart. Breaking is their
end; they're not exempt from breakage. In the same way, all sentient
beings are liable to die. Death is their end; they're not exempt from
death."

That is what the Buddha said. ...

> "All beings will die,\
> for life ends in death.\
> They pass on according to their deeds,\
> reaping the fruits of good and bad.\
> Those who do bad go to hell,\
> and if you do good you go to heaven.
>
> That's why you should do good,\
> investing in the future life.\
> The good deeds of sentient beings\
> support them in the next world."

### N 3.23 The World *Lokasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, "Sir, how many
things arise in the world for its harm, suffering, and discomfort?"

"Great king, three things arise in the world for its harm, suffering,
and discomfort. What three? Greed, hate, and delusion. These three
things arise in the world for its harm, suffering, and discomfort."

That is what the Buddha said. ...

> "When greed, hate, and delusion,\
> have arisen inside oneself,\
> they harm a person of wicked heart,\
> as a reed is destroyed by its own fruit."

### N 3.24 Archery *Issattasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, "Sir, where should
a gift be given?"

"Wherever your heart feels inspired, great king."

"But sir, where is a gift very fruitful?"

"Where a gift should be given is one thing, great king, but where a gift
is very fruitful is another. A gift is very fruitful when it's given to
an ethical person, not so much to an unethical person. Well then, great
king, I'll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.

What do you think, great king? Suppose you were at war, ready to fight a
battle. Then along comes an aristocrat youth who is untrained, inexpert,
unfit, inexperienced. And he's fearful, scared, nervous, quick to flee.
Would you employ such a man? Would he be of any use to you?"

"No, sir, I would have no use for such a man."

"What about a brahmin youth, a peasant youth, or a menial youth who was
similar?"

"No, sir, I would have no use for such a man."

"What do you think, great king? Suppose you were at war, ready to fight
a battle. Then along comes an aristocrat youth who is trained, expert,
fit, experienced. And he's fearless, brave, bold, standing his ground.
Would you employ such a man? Would he be of any use to you?"

"Yes, sir, I would have a use for such a man."

"What about a brahmin youth, a peasant youth, or a menial youth who was
similar? Would you employ such a man? Would he be of any use to you?"

"Yes, sir, I would have a use for such a man."

"In the same way, a gift to anyone who has given up five factors and
possesses five factors is very fruitful, no matter what family they've
gone forth from.

What are the five factors they've given up? Sensual desire, ill will,
dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. These are
the five factors they've given up.

What are the five factors they possess? The entire spectrum of an
adept's ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and knowledge and vision of
freedom. These are the five factors they possess.

I say that a gift to anyone who has given up these five factors and
possesses these five factors is very fruitful."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to

### N 3.25 The Simile of the Mountain *Pabbatūpamasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

King Pasenadi of Kosala sat to one side, and the Buddha said to him,
"So, great king, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?"

"Sir, there are anointed aristocratic kings who are infatuated with
authority, and obsessed with greed for sensual pleasures. They have
attained stability in the country, occupying a vast conquered territory.
Today I have been busy fulfilling the duties of such kings."

"What do you think, great king? Suppose a trustworthy and dependable man
were to come from the east. He'd approach you and say: 'Please great
king, you should know this. I come from the east. There I saw a huge
mountain that reached the clouds. And it was coming this way, crushing
all creatures. So then, great king, do what you must!'

Then a second trustworthy and dependable man were to come from the west
... a third from the north ... and a fourth from the south. He'd
approach you and say: 'Please great king, you should know this. I come
from the south. There I saw a huge mountain that reached the clouds. And
it was coming this way, crushing all creatures. So then, great king, do
what you must!'

Should such a dire threat arise---a terrible loss of human life, when
human birth is so rare---what would you do?"

"Sir, what could I do but practice the teachings, practice morality,
doing skillful and good actions?"

"I tell you, great king, I announce to you: old age and death are
advancing upon you. Since old age and death are advancing upon you, what
would you do?"

"Sir, what can I do but practice the teachings, practice morality, doing
skillful and good actions?

Sir, there are anointed aristocratic kings who are infatuated with
authority, and obsessed with greed for sensual pleasures. They have
attained stability in the country, occupying a vast conquered territory.
Such kings engage in battles of elephants, cavalry, chariots, or
infantry. But there is no place, no domain for such battles when old age
and death are advancing.

In this royal court there are ministers of wise counsel who are capable
of dividing an approaching enemy by wise counsel. But there is no place,
no domain for such diplomatic battles when old age and death are
advancing.

In this royal court there is abundant gold, both coined and uncoined,
stored in dungeons and towers. Using this wealth we can bribe an
approaching enemy. But there is no place, no domain for such monetary
battles when old age and death are advancing.

When old age and death are advancing, what can I do but practice the
teachings, practice morality, doing skillful and good actions?"

"That's so true, great king! That's so true! When old age and death are
advancing, what can you do but practice the teachings, practice
morality, doing skillful and good actions?"

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "Suppose there were vast mountains\
> of solid rock pushing the sky\
> drawing in from all sides\
> and crushing the four quarters.
>
> So too old age and death\
> advance upon all living creatures---\
> aristocrats, brahmins, peasants,\
> menials, corpse-workers, and scavengers.\
> They spare nothing.\
> They crush all beneath them.
>
> There's nowhere for elephants to take a stand,\
> nor chariots nor infantry.\
> They can't be defeated\
> by diplomatic battles or by wealth.
>
> That's why an astute person,\
> seeing what's good for themselves,\
> being wise, would place faith\
> in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.
>
> Whoever lives by the teaching\
> in body, speech, and mind,\
> is praised in this life\
> and departs to rejoice in heaven."

# Linked Discourses With Māra

## Chapter One

### N 4.1 Mortification *Tapokammasutta*

So I have heard. At one time, when he was first awakened,
the Buddha was staying in Uruvelā at the root of the
goatherd's banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.

Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, "I am
truly freed from that grueling work! Thank goodness I'm freed from that
pointless grueling work. Thank goodness that, steadfast and mindful, I
have attained awakening."

And then Māra the Wicked, knowing the Buddha's train of
thought, went up to him and addressed him in verse:

> "You've departed from the practice of mortification\
> by which humans purify themselves.\
> You're impure, but think yourself pure;\
> you've strayed from the path of purity."

Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked,
replied to him in verse:

> "I realized that it's pointless;\
> all that mortification in search of immortality\
> is as futile\
> as oars and rudder on dry land.
>
> Ethics, immersion, and wisdom:\
> by developing this path to awakening\
> I attained ultimate purity.\
> You're beaten, terminator!"

Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, "The Buddha knows me! The
Holy One knows me!" miserable and sad, vanished right there.

### N 4.2 In the Form of an Elephant King *Hatthirājavaṇṇasutta*

So I have heard. At one time, when he was first awakened,
the Buddha was staying in Uruvelā at the root of the
goatherd's banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.

Now at that time the Buddha was meditating in the open during the dark
of night, while a gentle rain drizzled down.

Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the Buddha feel fear,
terror, and goosebumps, manifested in the form of a huge elephant king
and approached him. Its head was like a huge block of soapstone. Its
tusks were like pure silver. Its trunk was like a long plough pole.

Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked,
addressed him in verse:

> "Transmigrating for such a long time,\
> you've made forms beautiful and ugly.\
> Enough of this, Wicked One!\
> You're beaten, terminator!"

Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, "The Buddha knows me! The
Holy One knows me!" miserable and sad, vanished right there.

### N 4.3 Beautiful *Subhasutta*

So I have heard. At one time, when he was first awakened,
the Buddha was staying in Uruvelā at the root of the
goatherd's banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.

Now at that time the Buddha was meditating in the open during the dark
of night, while a gentle rain drizzled down.

Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the Buddha feel fear,
terror, and goosebumps, approached him, and while not far away generated
a rainbow of bright colors, both beautiful and ugly.

Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked,
replied to him in verse:

> "Transmigrating for such a long time,\
> you've made forms beautiful and ugly.\
> Enough of this, Wicked One!\
> You're beaten, terminator.
>
> Those who are well restrained\
> in body, speech, and mind\
> don't fall under Māra's sway,\
> nor are they your lackies."

Then Māra ... vanished right there.

### N 4.4 Māra's Snares (1st) *Paṭhamamārapāsasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana. There the Buddha addressed the
mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, I have attained and realized supreme freedom through
rational application of mind and rational right effort. You too should
attain and realize supreme freedom through rational application of mind
and rational right effort."

Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed
him in verse:

> "You're bound by Māra's snares,\
> both human and heavenly.\
> You're bound by Māra's bonds:\
> you won't escape me, ascetic!"
>
> "I'm freed from Māra's snares,\
> both human and heavenly.\
> I'm freed from Māra's bonds.\
> You're beaten, terminator!"

Then Māra ... vanished right there.

### N 4.5 Māra's Snares (2nd) *Dutiyamārapāsasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Varanasi, in the deer park at
Isipatana. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, I am freed from all snares, both human and heavenly. You
are also freed from all snares, both human and heavenly.

Wander forth, mendicants, for the welfare and happiness of the people,
out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness
of gods and humans. Let not two go by one road.

Teach the Dhamma that's good in the beginning, good in the middle, and
good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And reveal a spiritual
practice that's entirely full and pure. There are beings with little
dust in their eyes. They're in decline because they haven't heard the
teaching. There will be those who understand the teaching!

I will travel to Uruvelā, the village of
Senāni, in order to teach the Dhamma."

Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed
him in verse:

> "You're bound by all snares,\
> both human and heavenly.\
> You're bound by the great bond:\
> you won't escape me, ascetic!"
>
> "I'm freed from all snares,\
> both human and heavenly.\
> I'm freed from the great bonds;\
> You're beaten, terminator!"

Then Māra ... vanished right there.

### N 4.6 A Serpent *Sappasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding
ground.

Now at that time the Buddha was meditating in the open during the dark
of night, while a gentle rain drizzled down.

Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the Buddha feel fear,
terror, and goosebumps, manifested in the form of a huge serpent king
and approached him. Its body was like a huge canoe carved from a single
tree. Its hood was like a large brewer's sieve. Its eyes were like those
big bronze cups from Kosala. Its tongue flickered from its mouth like
lightning flashes in a thunderstorm. The sound of its breathing was like
the puffing of a blacksmith's bellows.

Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked,
replied to him in verse:

> "A self-controlled sage frequents\
> empty buildings for lodging.\
> It's appropriate for such a person\
> to live there after relinquishing.
>
> Though there are lots of creepy crawlies,\
> and lots of flies and snakes,\
> they wouldn't stir a hair\
> of a great sage in that empty hut.
>
> Though the firmament may split\
> \>and the earth may quake,\
> and all creatures be stricken with fear;\
> and even if an arrow's aimed at their breast,\
> the Buddhas take no shelter in attachments."

Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, "The Buddha knows me! The
Holy One knows me!" miserable and sad, vanished right there.

### N 4.7 Sleeping *Supatisutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the
Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding ground.

He spent much of the night walking mindfully in the open. At the crack
of dawn he washed his feet and entered his dwelling. He laid down in the
lion's posture---on the right side, placing one foot on top of the
other---mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.

Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed
him in verse:

> "What, you're asleep?\
> \>Really, you're asleep?\
> You sleep like a loser---\
> \>what's up with that?\
> You sleep, thinking that the hut is empty.\
> You sleep when the sun has come up---\
> \>what's up with that?"
>
> "For them there is no craving---\
> the weaver, the clinger---\
> \>to track them anywhere.\
> With the ending of all attachments\
> \>the awakened Buddha sleeps.\
> What's that got to do with you, Māra?"

Then Māra ... vanished right there.

### N 4.8 Delighting *Nandatisutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery.

Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and recited this
verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "Your children bring you delight!\
> Your cattle also bring you delight!\
> For attachments are a man's delight;\
> without attachments there's no delight."
>
> "Your children bring you sorrow.\
> Your cattle also bring you sorrow.\
> For attachments are a man's sorrow;\
> without attachments there are no sorrows."

Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, "The Buddha knows me! The
Holy One knows me!" miserable and sad, vanished right there.

### N 4.9 Lifespan (1st) *Paṭhamaāyusutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding
ground. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, the lifespan of humans is short. You must go to the next
life. So you should do what is skillful, you should practice the
spiritual life. No-one born is immortal. A long life is a hundred years
or a little more."

Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed
him in verse:

> "The life of humans is long!\
> A true person wouldn't scorn it.\
> Live like a suckling babe,\
> for Death has not come for you."
>
> "The life of humans is short,\
> and a true person scorns it.\
> They should live as though their head was on fire,\
> for Death comes for everyone."

Then Māra ... vanished right there.

### N 4.10 Lifespan (2nd) *Dutiyaāyusutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding
ground. There the Buddha ... said:

"Mendicants, the lifespan of humans is short. You must go to the next
life. So you should do what is skillful, you should practice the
spiritual life. No-one born is immortal. A long life is a hundred years
or a little more."

Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed
him in verse:

> "The days and nights don't rush by,\
> and life isn't cut short.\
> The life of mortals keeps rolling on,\
> like a chariot's rim around the hub."
>
> "The days and nights rush by,\
> and then life is cut short.\
> The life of mortals wastes away,\
> like the water in tiny streams."

Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, "The Buddha knows me! The
Holy One knows me!" miserable and sad, vanished right there.

## Chapter Two

### N 4.11 Boulders *Pāsāṇasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the
Vulture's Peak Mountain. Now at that time the Buddha was meditating in
the open during the dark of night, while a gentle rain drizzled down.

Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the Buddha feel fear,
terror, and goosebumps, approached him, and crushed some large boulders
close by him.

Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked,
addressed him in verse:

> "Even if you shake\
> this entire Vulture's Peak,\
> the rightly released,\
> the awakened, are unshaken."

Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, "The Buddha knows me! The
Holy One knows me!" miserable and sad, vanished right there.

### N 4.12 Lion *Kinnusīhasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Now, at that time the
Buddha was teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly.

Then Māra thought, "The ascetic Gotama is teaching Dhamma,
surrounded by a large assembly. Why don't I go and pull the wool over
their eyes?"

Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed
him in verse:

> "Why now do you roar like a lion?\
> You're so self-assured in the assembly!\
> For there is someone who'll wrestle with you,\
> so why do you imagine you're the victor?"
>
> "The great heroes they roar,\
> self-assured in the assemblies.\
> The Realized One, attained to power,\
> has crossed over clinging to the world."

Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, "The Buddha knows me! The
Holy One knows me!" miserable and sad, vanished right there.

### N 4.13 A Splinter *Sakalikasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha in the Maddakucchi deer park.

Now at that time the Buddha's foot had been cut by a splinter. The
Buddha was stricken by harrowing pains; physical feelings that were
painful, sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, and disagreeable. But he
endured unbothered, with mindfulness and situational awareness. And then
he spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion's
posture---on the right side, placing one foot on top of the
other---mindful and aware.

Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed
him in verse:

> "Are you feeble that you lie down?\
> \>Or are you drunk on poetry?\
> Don't you have all that you need?\
> Alone in a secluded lodging,\
> why this sleeping, sleepyhead?"
>
> "I'm not feeble that I lie down,\
> \>nor am I drunk on poetry.\
> Having reached the goal, I'm rid of sorrow.\
> Alone in a secluded lodging,\
> I lie down full of sympathy for all living creatures.
>
> Even those with a dart stuck in the breast,\
> piercing the heart again and again,\
> are able to get some sleep.\
> So why not I, whose dart is drawn out?
>
> I don't lie awake tense, nor do I fear to sleep.\
> The days and nights don't disturb me,\
> as I see no decline for myself in the world.\
> That's why I lie down full of sympathy for all living creatures."

Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, "The Buddha knows me! The
Holy One knows me!" miserable and sad, vanished right there.

### N 4.14 Appropriate *Patirūpasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans near the
brahmin village of Ekasālā.

Now, at that time the Buddha was teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large
assembly of laypeople.

Then Māra thought, "The ascetic Gotama is teaching Dhamma,
surrounded by a large assembly of laypeople. Why don't I go and pull the
wool over their eyes?"

Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed
him in verse:

> "It's not appropriate for you\
> to instruct others.\
> As you engage in this,\
> don't get caught up in favoring and opposing."
>
> "The Buddha instructs others\
> out of compassion for their welfare.\
> The Realized One is liberated\
> from favoring and opposing."

Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, "The Buddha knows me! The
Holy One knows me!" miserable and sad, vanished right there.

### N 4.15 A Mental Snare *Mānasasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery.

Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed
him in verse:

> "There's a mental snare\
> wandering the sky.\
> I'll bind you with it---\
> you won't escape me, ascetic!"
>
> "Sights, sounds, tastes, smells,\
> and touches so delightful:\
> desire for these is gone from me.\
> You're beaten, terminator!"

Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, "The Buddha knows me! The
Holy One knows me!" miserable and sad, vanished right there.

### N 4.16 The Alms Bowls *Pattasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time the Buddha was educating, encouraging, firing up, and
inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk on the topic of the five
grasping aggregates. And those mendicants were paying attention,
applying the mind, concentrating wholeheartedly, and actively listening.

Then Māra thought, "This ascetic Gotama is educating,
encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk
on the topic of the five grasping aggregates. And the mendicants are
paying attention, applying the mind, concentrating wholeheartedly, and
actively listening. Why don't I go and pull the wool over their eyes?"

At that time several alms bowls were placed in the open air. Then
Māra the Wicked manifested in the form of an ox and
approached those bowls.

One of the mendicants said to another, "Mendicant, mendicant, that ox
will break the bowls."

When this was said, the Buddha said to that mendicant, "Mendicant,
that's no ox. That's Māra the Wicked come to pull the wool
over your eyes!"

Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked,
addressed him in verse:

> "Sights, feeling, and perception,\
> consciousness and what is chosen:\
> 'I am not this' and 'this is not mine';\
> that's how to be free of desire for them.
>
> When you're detached, secure,\
> all fetters transcended,\
> though Māra and his army chase everywhere\
> they never find you."

Then Māra ... vanished right there.

### N 4.17 The Six Fields of Contact *Chaphassāyatanasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the
Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.

Now at that time the Buddha was educating, encouraging, firing up, and
inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk on the topic of the six
fields of contact. And those mendicants were paying attention, applying
the mind, concentrating wholeheartedly, and actively listening.

Then Māra thought, "This ascetic Gotama is educating,
encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk
on the topic of the six fields of contact. And those mendicants are
paying attention, applying the mind, concentrating wholeheartedly, and
actively listening. Why don't I go and pull the wool over their eyes?"

Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and made a
terrifyingly loud noise close by him. It seemed as if the earth were
shattering, so that one of the mendicants said to another, "Mendicant,
mendicant, it seems like the earth is shattering!"

When this was said, the Buddha said to that mendicant, "Mendicant,
that's not the earth shattering. That's Māra the Wicked
come to pull the wool over your eyes!"

Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked,
addressed him in verse:

> "Sights, sounds, tastes, smells,\
> touches, and ideas, the lot of them---\
> this is the dreadful bait\
> that the world's infatuated by.
>
> But a mindful disciple of the Buddha\
> has transcended all that.\
> Having slipped free of Māra's dominion,\
> they shine like the sun."

Then Māra ... vanished right there.

### N 4.18 Alms Food *Piṇḍasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans near the
brahmin village of Pañcasālā.

Now at that time in Pañcasālā the young women were taking
care of guests. Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his
bowl and robe, entered Pañcasālā for alms.

Now at that time Māra had possessed the brahmins and
householders of Pañcasālā, so that they thought, "Don't let
the ascetic Gotama get any alms!"

Then the Buddha left the village with his bowl as clean-washed as it was
when he entered for alms.

Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and said to him,
"Well, ascetic, did you get any alms?"

"Wicked One, did you make sure I didn't get any alms?"

"Well then, sir, let the Buddha enter Pañcasālā a second
time for alms. I'll make sure you get alms."

> "Māra has produced wickedness\
> in attacking the Realized One.\
> Wicked One, do you imagine that\
> your wickedness won't bear fruit?
>
> Let us live so very happily,\
> we who have nothing.\
> We shall feed on rapture,\
> like the gods of streaming radiance."

Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, "The Buddha knows me! The
Holy One knows me!" miserable and sad, vanished right there.

### N 4.19 A Farmer *Kassakasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time the Buddha was educating, encouraging, firing up, and
inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk about extinguishment. And
those mendicants were paying attention, applying the mind, concentrating
wholeheartedly, and actively listening.

Then Māra thought, "The ascetic Gotama is giving a Dhamma
talk about extinguishment ... and the mendicants are listening well. Why
don't I go and pull the wool over their eyes?"

Then Māra the Wicked manifested in the form of a farmer
carrying a large plough on his shoulder. He held a long goad, his hair
was messy, he was clad in sunn hemp, and his feet were muddy. He went up
to the Buddha and said to him, "So, ascetic, did you happen to see any
oxen?"

"But what have you to do with oxen, Wicked One?"

"Mine alone, ascetic, is the eye, mine are sights, mine is the field of
eye contact consciousness. Where can you escape me, ascetic? Mine alone
is the ear ... nose ... tongue ... body ... mind, mine are ideas, mine
is the field of mind contact consciousness. Where can you escape me,
ascetic?"

"Yours alone, Wicked One, is the eye, yours are sights, yours is the
field of eye contact consciousness. Where there is no eye, no sights, no
eye contact consciousness---you have no place there, Wicked One! Yours
alone is the ear ... nose ... tongue ... body ... mind, yours are ideas,
yours is the field of mind contact consciousness. Where there is no
mind, no ideas, no mind contact consciousness---you have no place there,
Wicked One!"

> "The things they call 'mine',\
> and those who say 'it's mine':\
> if your mind remains there,\
> you won't escape me, ascetic!"
>
> "The things they speak of aren't mine;\
> I'm not someone who speaks like that.\
> So know this, Wicked One:\
> you won't even see the path I take."

Then Māra ... vanished right there.

### N 4.20 Ruling *Rajjasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans, in a
wilderness hut on the slopes of the Himalayas.

Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, "I
wonder if it's possible to rule legitimately, without killing or having
someone kill for you; without conquering or having someone conquer for
you; without sorrowing or causing sorrow?"

And then Māra the Wicked, knowing the Buddha's train of
thought, went up to him and said, "Rule, Blessed One! Rule, Holy One!
Rule legitimately, without killing or having someone kill for you;
without conquering or having someone conquer for you; without sorrowing
or causing sorrow!"

"But what do you see, Wicked One, that you say this to me?"

"The Blessed One, sir, has developed and cultivated the four bases for
psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up,
consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the
Blessed One need only determine that the Himalaya, king of mountains,
was gold, and it would turn into gold."

> "Take a golden mountain,\
> entirely of native gold, and double it---\
> it's still not enough for one!\
> Knowing this, live a moral life.
>
> When a person has seen where suffering comes from\
> how could they incline towards sensual pleasures?\
> Realizing that attachment is a snare in the world,\
> a person would train to remove it."

Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, "The Buddha knows me! The
Holy One knows me!" miserable and sad, vanished right there.

## Chapter Three

### N 4.21 Several *Sambahulasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in the
land of the Sakyans near Silāvatī.

Now at that time several mendicants were meditating not far from the
Buddha, diligent, keen, and resolute.

Then Māra the Wicked manifested in the form of a brahmin
with a large matted dreadlock, wearing an antelope hide. He was old,
bent double, wheezing, and held a staff made of cluster fig tree wood.
He went up to those mendicants and said, "You've gone forth while young,
reverends. With pristine black hair, you're blessed with youth, in the
prime of life, and you've never flirted with sensual pleasures. Enjoy
human sensual pleasures. Don't give up what is apparent in the present
to chase after what takes effect over time."

"Brahmin, that's not what we're doing. We're giving up what takes effect
over time to chase after what is apparent in the present. For the Buddha
says that sensual pleasures take effect over time; they give much
suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks. But
this teaching is apparent in the present life, immediately effective,
inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for
themselves."

When they had spoken, Māra the Wicked shook his head,
waggled his tongue, raised his eyebrows until his brow puckered in three
furrows, and departed leaning on his staff.

Then those mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said, "Mendicants, that
was no brahmin. That was Māra the Wicked who came to pull
the wool over your eyes!"

Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha recited
this verse:

> "When a person has seen where suffering comes from\
> how could they incline towards sensual pleasures?\
> Realizing that attachment is a snare in the world,\
> a person would train to remove it."

### N 4.22 With Samiddhi *Samiddhisutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near
Silāvatī.

Now at that time Venerable Samiddhi was meditating not far from the
Buddha, diligent, keen, and resolute. Then as Venerable Samiddhi was in
private retreat this thought came to his mind, "I'm so fortunate, so
very fortunate, to have a teacher who is a perfected one, a fully
awakened Buddha! I'm so fortunate, so very fortunate, to have gone forth
in a teaching and training so well explained! I'm so fortunate, so very
fortunate, to have spiritual companions who are ethical and of good
character."

And then Māra the Wicked, knowing Samiddhi's train of
thought, went up to him and made a terrifyingly loud noise close by him.
It seemed as if the earth was shattering.

Then Samiddhi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and
told him what had happened. The Buddha said, "Samiddhi, that's not the
earth shattering. That's Māra the Wicked come to pull the
wool over your eyes! Go back to that same place, Samiddhi, and meditate,
diligent, keen, and resolute."

"Yes, sir," replied Samiddhi. He got up from his seat, bowed, and
respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before
leaving.

And for a second time Samiddhi was meditating in that same place,
diligent, ardent, and resolute. And for a second time he had the same
thought ... and Māra made an earth-shattering noise.

Then Samiddhi addressed Māra the Wicked One in verse:

> "I went forth out of faith\
> from the lay life to homelessness.\
> My mindfulness and wisdom are mature,\
> my mind is serene in immersion.\
> Make whatever illusions you want,\
> it won't bother me."

Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, "The mendicant Samiddhi
knows me!" miserable and sad, vanished right there.

### N 4.23 With Godhika *Godhikasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding
ground.

Now at that time Venerable Godhika was staying on the slopes of Isigili
at the Black Rock. Then Venerable Godhika, meditating diligent, keen,
and resolute, experienced temporary freedom of heart. But then he fell
away from that temporary freedom of heart. For a second ... third ...
fourth ... fifth ... sixth time Godhika experienced temporary freedom of
heart. But for a sixth time he fell away from it. For a seventh time
Godhika, meditating diligent, keen, and resolute, experienced temporary
freedom of heart.

Then he thought, "I've fallen away from this temporary freedom of heart
no less than six times. Why don't I take my life?"

And then Māra the Wicked, knowing Godhika's train of
thought, went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse:

> "O great hero, O greatly wise!\
> Shining with power and glory.\
> You've gone beyond all threats and perils,\
> I bow to your feet, O Clear-eyed One!
>
> Great hero, master of death,\
> your disciple longs for death,\
> he's planning for it.\
> Stop him, O light-bringer!
>
> For how, Blessed One, can a disciple of yours,\
> one who loves your teaching,\
> a trainee who hasn't achieved their heart's desire,\
> take his own life, O renowned one?"

Now at that time Venerable Godhika had already taken his life.

Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked,
addressed him in verse:

> "This is how the attentive act,\
> for they don't long for life.\
> Having plucked out craving, root and all,\
> Godhika is quenched."

Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, "Come, mendicants, let's go to
the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili where Godhika, who came from a
good family, took his life."

"Yes, sir," they replied.

Then the Buddha together with several mendicants went to the Black Rock
on the slopes of Isigili. The Buddha saw Godhika off in the distance
lying on his cot, having cast off the aggregates.

Now at that time a cloud of black smoke was moving east, west, north,
south, above, below, and in-between.

Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,

"Mendicants, do you see that cloud of black smoke moving east, west,
north, south, above, below, and in-between?"

"Yes, sir."

"That's Māra the Wicked searching for Godhika's
consciousness, wondering: 'Where is Godhika's consciousness
established?' But since his consciousness is not established, Godhika is
quenched."

Then Māra, carrying his arched harp made from the pale
timber of wood-apple, went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse:

> "Above, below, all round,\
> in the four quarters and in-between,\
> I've been searching without success:\
> where has that Godhika got to?"
>
> "He was an attentive and steadfast sage,\
> a meditator who loved absorption.\
> By day and by night he applied himself,\
> without concern for his life.
>
> He defeated the army of death,\
> and won't return for any future life.\
> Having plucked out craving, root and all\
> Godhika is quenched."
>
> So stricken with sorrow\
> that his harp dropped from his armpit,\
> that spirit, downcast,\
> vanished right there.

### N 4.24 Seven Years of Following *Sattavassānubandhasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in
Uruvelā at the goatherd's banyan tree on the bank of the
Nerañjarā River.

Now at that time Māra the Wicked had been following the
Buddha for seven years hoping to find a vulnerability without success.

Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed
him in verse:

> "Are you swamped by sorrow\
> \>that you meditate in the forest?\
> Have you lost a fortune, or do you long for one?\
> Or perhaps you've committed\
> \>some crime in the village?\
> Why don't you get too close to people?\
> And why does no-one get close to you?"
>
> "I've dug out the root of sorrow completely.\
> I practice absorption free of guilt or sorrow.\
> I've cut off all greed and prayer for future lives.\
> Undefiled, I practice absorption,\
> \>O kinsman of the negligent!"
>
> "The things they call 'mine',\
> and those who say 'it's mine':\
> if your mind remains there,\
> you won't escape me, ascetic!"
>
> "The things they speak of aren't mine;\
> I'm not someone who speaks like that.\
> So know this, Wicked One:\
> you won't even see the path I take."
>
> "If you've discovered the path\
> that's safe, and leads to freedom from death,\
> go and walk that path alone---\
> why teach it to anyone else?"
>
> "Those crossing to the far shore\
> ask what's beyond the domain of Death.\
> When I'm asked, I explain to them\
> the truth without attachments."

"Sir, suppose there was a lotus pond not far from a town or village, and
a crab lived there. Then several boys or girls would leave the town or
village and go to the pond, where they'd pull out the crab and put it on
dry land. Whenever that crab extended a claw, those boys or girls would
snap, crack, and break it off with a stick or a stone. And when that
crab's claws had all been snapped, cracked, and broken off it wouldn't
be able to return down into that lotus pond.

In the same way, sir, the Buddha has snapped, cracked, and broken off
all my twists, ducks, and dodges. Now I'm not able to approach the
Buddha again in hopes of finding a vulnerability."

Then Māra the Wicked recited these verses of disappointment
in the Buddha's presence:

> "A crow once circled a stone\
> that looked like a lump of fat.\
> 'Perhaps I'll find something tender,' it thought,\
> 'perhaps there's something tasty.'
>
> But finding nothing tasty,\
> the crow left that place.\
> Like the crow that pecked the stone,\
> I leave Gotama disappointed."

### N 4.25 Māra's Daughters *Māradhītusutta*

And then Māra the Wicked, after reciting these verses of
disillusionment in the Buddha's presence, left that place. He sat
cross-legged on the ground not far from the Buddha, silent, dismayed,
shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say, scratching
the ground with a stick.

Then Māra's daughters Craving, Delight, and Lust went up to
Māra the Wicked, and addressed him in verse:

> "Why so downhearted, dad?\
> What man are you upset about?\
> We'll catch him with the snare of lust,\
> like an elephant in the wild.\
> We'll tie him up and bring him back---\
> he'll fall under your sway!"
>
> "In this world he is the perfected one, the Holy One.\
> He's not easily seduced by lust.\
> He has slipped free of Māra's dominion;\
> that's why I'm so upset."

Then Māra's daughters Craving, Delight, and Lust went up to
the Buddha, and said to him, "We serve at your feet, ascetic." But the
Buddha ignored them, since he was freed with the supreme ending of
attachments.

Then Craving, Delight, and Lust withdrew to one side to think up a plan.
"Men have a diverse spectrum of tastes. Why don't we each manifest in
the form of a hundred young maidens?"

So that's what they did. Then they went up to the Buddha and said to
him, "We serve at your feet, ascetic." But the Buddha still ignored
them, since he was freed with the supreme ending of attachments.

Then Craving, Delight, and Lust withdrew to one side to think up a plan.
"Men have a diverse spectrum of tastes. Why don't we each manifest in
the form of a hundred women who have never given birth?" So that's what
they did. Then they went up to the Buddha and said to him, "We serve at
your feet, ascetic." But the Buddha still ignored them, since he was
freed with the supreme ending of attachments.

Then Craving, Delight, and Lust ... each manifested in the form of a
hundred women who have given birth once ... women who have given birth
twice ... middle-aged women ... old women ... But the Buddha still
ignored them, since he was freed with the supreme ending of attachments.

Then Craving, Delight, and Lust withdrew to one side and said, "What our
father said is true:

> 'In this world he is the perfected one, the Holy One.\
> He's not easily seduced by lust.\
> He has slipped free of Māra's dominion;\
> that's why I'm so upset.'

For if we had come on to any ascetic or brahmin like this who was not
free of lust, his heart would explode, or he'd spew hot blood from his
mouth, or he'd go mad and lose his mind. He'd dry up, wither away, and
shrivel up like a green reed that was mowed down."

Then Māra's daughters Craving, Delight, and Lust went up to
the Buddha, and stood to one side. Māra's daughter Craving
addressed the Buddha in verse:

> "Are you swamped by sorrow\
> \>that you meditate in the forest?\
> Have you lost a fortune, or do you long for one?\
> Or perhaps you've committed\
> \>some crime in the village?\
> Why don't you get too close to people?\
> And why does no-one get close to you?"
>
> "I've reached the goal, peace of heart.\
> Having conquered the army\
> \>of the likable and pleasant,\
> alone, practicing absorption, I awakened to bliss.\
> That's why I don't get too close to people,\
> and no-one gets too close to me."

Then Māra's daughter Delight addressed the Buddha in verse:

> "How does a mendicant who has crossed five floods\
> usually meditate here while crossing the sixth?\
> How do they usually practice absorption\
> \>so that sensual perceptions\
> are blocked out and don't get hold of them?"
>
> "With tranquil body and mind well freed,\
> without making plans, mindful, homeless;\
> understanding the teaching,\
> \>they practice absorption not placing the mind;\
> they're not shaking or drifting or rigid.
>
> That's how a mendicant who has crossed five floods\
> usually meditates here while crossing the sixth.\
> That's how they usually practice absorption\
> \>so that sensual perceptions\
> are blocked out and don't get hold of them."

Then Māra's daughter Lust addressed the Buddha in verse:

> "He lives with his community after cutting off craving,\
> and many of the faithful will cross over for sure.\
> Alas, this homeless one will snatch many men away,\
> and lead them past the King of Death!"
>
> "The great heroes they lead\
> by means of the true teaching.\
> When the Realized Ones are leading by the teaching,\
> how could anyone who knows be jealous?"

Then Māra's daughters Craving, Delight, and Lust went up to
Māra the Wicked. Māra the Wicked saw them
coming off in the distance, and addressed them in verse:

> "Fools! You drill into a mountain\
> with lotus stalks!\
> You dig up a hill with your nails!\
> You chew iron with your teeth!
>
> You seek a footing in the deeps, as it were,\
> while lifting a rock with your head!\
> After attacking a stump with your breast, as it were,\
> you leave Gotama disappointed."
>
> "They came in their splendor---\
> Craving, Delight, and Lust.\
> But the Teacher brushed them off right there,\
> like the gale, a fallen tuft."



# Linked Discourses With Nuns

## The Chapter on Nuns

### N 5.1 With Āḷavikā *Āḷavikāsutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery.

Then the nun Āḷavikā robed up in the morning and, taking
her bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. She wandered
for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on her return from
almsround, she went to the Dark Forest seeking seclusion.

Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the nun
Āḷavikā feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make
her fall away from seclusion, went up to her and addressed her in verse:

> "There's no escape in the world,\
> so what will seclusion do for you?\
> Enjoy erotic delights;\
> don't regret it later."

Then the nun Āḷavikā thought, "Who's speaking this verse, a
human or a non-human?"

Then she thought, "This is Māra the Wicked, wanting to make
me feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make me fall away from
seclusion!"

Then Āḷavikā, knowing that this was Māra the
Wicked, replied to him in verse:

> "There is an escape in the world,\
> and I've personally experienced it with wisdom.\
> O Wicked One, kinsman of the negligent,\
> you don't know that place.
>
> Sensual pleasures are like swords and spears;\
> the aggregates are their chopping block.\

deep into it, and sat at the root of a tree to meditate.

Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the nun
Somā feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make her
fall away from immersion, went up to her and addressed her in verse:

> "That state's very challenging;\
> it's for the sages to attain.\
> It's not possible for a woman,\
> with her two-fingered wisdom."

Then the nun Somā thought, "Who's speaking this verse, a
human or a non-human?"

Then she thought, "This is Māra the Wicked, wanting to make
me feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make me fall away from
immersion!"

Then Somā, knowing that this was Māra the
Wicked, replied to him in verse:

> "What difference does womanhood make\
> when the mind is serene,\
> and knowledge is present\
> as you rightly discern the Dhamma.
>
> Surely someone who might think:\
> 'I am woman', or 'I am man',\
> or 'I am' anything at all,\

verse:

> "Why do you sit alone and cry\
> as if your children have died?\
> You've come to the woods all alone---\
> you must be looking for a man!"

Then the nun Kisāgotamī thought, "Who's speaking this
verse, a human or a non-human?"

Then she thought, "This is Māra the Wicked, wanting to make
me feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make me fall away from
immersion!"

Then Kisāgotamī, knowing that this was Māra
the Wicked, replied to him in verse:

> "I've got over the death of children,\
> and I'm finished with men.\
> I don't grieve or lament,\
> and I'm not afraid of you, sir!
>
> Relishing is destroyed in every respect,\
> and the mass of darkness is shattered.\

immersion!"

Then Vijayā, knowing that this was Māra the
Wicked, replied to him in verse:

> I hand them right back to you, Māra,\
> for I have no use for them.
>
> This body is foul,\
> decaying and frail.\
> I'm horrified and repelled by it,\
> and I've eradicated sensual craving.
>
> There are beings in the realm of luminous form,\

> were to come here,\
> I'd stir not a hair nor panic.\
> I'm not scared of you, Māra, even alone.
>
> I'll vanish,\

> and you still wouldn't see me.
>
> I'm the master of my own mind,\

>
> "Death comes to those who are born,\

human or a non-human?"

Then she thought, "This is Māra the Wicked, wanting to make

> It comes to be because of a cause,\
> and ceases when the cause breaks up.
>
> It's like a seed that's sown\
> in a field; it grows\
> relying on both the soil's nutrients\
> as well as moisture.
>
> In the same way the aggregates and elements\
> and these six sense fields\
> come to be because of a cause,\
> and cease when the cause breaks up."

Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, "The nun Selā
knows me!" miserable and sad, vanished right there.

At Sāvatthī.

Then the nun Vajirā robed up in the morning and, taking her

human or a non-human?"

Then she thought, "This is Māra the Wicked, wanting to make
me feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make me fall away from
immersion!"

Then Vajirā, knowing that this was Māra the
Wicked, replied to him in verse:

> "Why do you believe there's such a thing as a\
> \>'sentient being'?\
> Māra, is this your theory?\
> This is just a pile of conditions,\
> you won't find a sentient being here.
>
> When the parts are assembled\
> we use the word 'chariot'.\
> So too, when the aggregates are present\
> 'sentient being' is the convention we use.
>
> But it's only suffering that comes to be,\
> lasts a while, then disappears.\
> Naught but suffering comes to be,\
> naught but suffering ceases."

Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, "The nun
Vajirā knows me!" miserable and sad, vanished right there.

# Linked Discourses With Brahmā Gods

## Chapter One

### N 6.1 The Appeal of the Divinity *Brahmāyācanasutta*

So I have heard. At one time, when he was first awakened,
the Buddha was staying in Uruvelā at the root of the
goatherd's banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.

Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, "This
principle I have discovered is deep, hard to see, hard to understand,
peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to
the astute. But people like clinging, they love it and enjoy it. It's
hard for them to see this topic; that is, specific conditionality,
dependent origination. It's also hard for them to see this topic; that
is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments,
the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment. And if I
were to teach this principle, others might not understand me, which
would be wearying and troublesome for me."

And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor
learned before in the past, occurred to the Buddha:

> "I've struggled hard to realize this,\
> enough with trying to explain it!\
> Those mired in greed and hate\
> can't really understand this teaching.
>
> It goes against the stream, subtle,\
> deep, obscure, and very fine.\
> Those besotted by greed cannot see,\
> for they're shrouded in a mass of darkness."

And as the Buddha reflected like this, his mind inclined to remaining
passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.

Then the divinity Sahampati, knowing the Buddha's train of thought,
thought, "Alas! The world will be lost, the world will perish! For the
mind of the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha,
inclines to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma."

Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm,
he vanished from the realm of divinity and reappeared in front of the
Buddha. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt with his right
knee on the ground, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:

"Sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach the
Dhamma! There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They're in
decline because they haven't heard the teaching. There will be those who
understand the teaching!"

This is what the divinity Sahampati said. Then he went on to say:

> "Among the Magadhans there appeared in the past\
> an impure teaching thought up by the stained.\
> Fling open the door to freedom from death!\
> Let them hear the teaching\
> \>the immaculate one discovered.
>
> Standing high on a rocky mountain,\
> you can see the people all around.\
> In just the same way, All-seer, so intelligent,\
> having ascended the Temple of Truth,\
> rid of sorrow, look upon the people\
> swamped with sorrow,\
> \>oppressed by rebirth and old age.
>
> Rise, hero! Victor in battle, leader of the caravan,\
> wander the world free of debt.\
> Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma!\
> There will be those who understand!"

Then the Buddha, understanding the Divinity's invitation, surveyed the
world with the eye of a Buddha, out of his compassion for sentient
beings. And the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in their
eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and
with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to
teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the
fault to do with the next world, while others did not.

It's like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some
of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving
underwater. Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the
water's surface. And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise
up above the water and stand with no water clinging to them.

In the same way, the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in
their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties
and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities,
easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the
danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not.

When he had seen this he replied in verse to the divinity Sahampati:

> "Flung open are the doors to freedom from death!\
> Let those with ears to hear commit to faith.\
> Thinking it would be troublesome, Divinity,\
> \>I did not teach\
> the sophisticated, sublime Dhamma among humans."

Then the divinity Sahampati, knowing that his request for the Buddha to
teach the Dhamma had been granted, bowed and respectfully circled the
Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.

### N 6.2 Respect *Gāravasutta*

So I have heard. At one time, when he was first awakened,
the Buddha was staying in Uruvelā at the root of the
goatherd's banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.

Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, "It's
unpleasant to live without respect and reverence. What ascetic or
brahmin should I honor and respect and rely on?"

Then it occurred to him:

"I'd honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to
complete the entire spectrum of ethics, if it were incomplete. But I
don't see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world---with its gods,
Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics
and brahmins, its gods and humans---who is more accomplished than myself
in ethics, who I should honor and respect and rely on.

I'd honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to
complete the entire spectrum of immersion, if it were incomplete. But I
don't see any other ascetic or brahmin ... who is more accomplished than
myself in immersion ...

I'd honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to
complete the entire spectrum of wisdom, if it were incomplete. But I
don't see any other ascetic or brahmin ... who is more accomplished than
myself in wisdom ...

I'd honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to
complete the entire spectrum of freedom, if it were incomplete. But I
don't see any other ascetic or brahmin ... who is more accomplished than
myself in freedom ...

I'd honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to
complete the entire spectrum of the knowledge and vision of freedom, if
it were incomplete. But I don't see any other ascetic or brahmin in this
world---with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this
population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans---who is
more accomplished than myself in the knowledge and vision of freedom,
who I should honor and respect and rely on. Why don't I honor and
respect and rely on the same Dhamma to which I was awakened?"

Then the divinity Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily
as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from
the realm of divinity and reappeared in front of the Buddha. He arranged
his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha,
and said:

"That's so true, Blessed One! That's so true, Holy One! All the
perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past honored
and respected and relied on this same teaching. All the perfected ones,
the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future will honor and
respect and rely on this same teaching. May the Blessed One, who is the
perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha at present, also honor and
respect and rely on this same teaching."

This is what the divinity Sahampati said. Then he went on to say:

> "All Buddhas in the past,\
> the Buddhas of the future,\
> and the Buddha at present---\
> destroyer of the sorrows of many---
>
> respecting the true teaching\
> they did live, they do live,\
> and they also will live.\
> This is the nature of the Buddhas.
>
> Therefore someone who cares for their own welfare,\
> and wants to become the very best they can be,\
> should respect the true teaching,\
> remembering the instructions of the Buddhas."

### N 6.3 With Brahmadeva *Brahmadevasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery.

Now at that time a certain brahmin lady had a son called Brahmadeva, who
had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the
Buddha.

Then Venerable Brahmadeva, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and
resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this
very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for
which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.

He understood: "Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been
completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further
for this place." And Venerable Brahmadeva became one of the perfected.

Then Brahmadeva robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
entered Sāvatthī for alms. Wandering indiscriminately for
almsfood in Sāvatthī, he approached his own mother's home.

Now at that time Brahmadeva's mother, the brahmin lady, was offering up
a regular oblation to the Divinity.

Then the divinity Sahampati thought, "This Venerable Brahmadeva's
mother, the brahmin lady, offers up a regular oblation to the Divinity.
Why don't I go and stir up a sense of urgency in her?"

Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm,
he vanished from the realm of divinity and reappeared in the home of
Brahmadeva's mother. Then the divinity Sahampati, while standing in the
air, addressed Brahmadeva's mother in verse:

> "Far from here is the realm of divinity, madam,\
> to which you offer a regular oblation.\
> But the Divinity doesn't eat that kind of food.\
> Why pray, when you don't know the path to divinity?
>
> This Brahmadeva, madam,\
> free of attachments, has surpassed the gods.\
> Owning nothing, providing for no other,\
> \>a mendicant\
> has entered your house for alms.
>
> He's worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods,\
> \>a knowledge master, evolved.\
> He's worthy of a religious donation\
> \>from gods and men.\
> Having banished all evils, he's unsullied.\
> Cool at heart, he wanders searching for food.
>
> He has no before and after,\
> peaceful, unclouded, untroubled,\
> \>with no need for hope,\
> he has laid down the rod\
> \>for all creatures firm and frail.\
> So let him enjoy your offering of choice alms.
>
> With peaceful mind, he has left the crowd,\
> he wanders like a tamed elephant, unperturbed.\
> He's a mendicant fair in ethics, with heart well freed.\
> So let him enjoy your offering of choice alms.
>
> With unwavering confidence in him,\
> present your religious donation\
> \>to one who is worthy of it.\
> Now that you've seen the sage who has crossed over,\
> \>madam,\
> make merit for the sake of future happiness!"
>
> With unwavering confidence in him,\
> she presented her religious donation\
> \>to one who is worthy of it.\
> After seeing the sage who had crossed over,\
> \>the brahmin lady\
> made merit for the sake of future happiness.

### N 6.4 With Baka the Divinity *Bakabrahmasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery.

Now at that time Baka the Divinity had the following harmful
misconception: "This is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal,
this is whole, this is not liable to pass away. For this is where
there's no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being
reborn. And there's no other escape beyond this."

Then the Buddha knew what Baka the Divinity was thinking. As easily as a
strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from
Jeta's Grove and reappeared in that realm of divinity.

Baka the Divinity saw the Buddha coming off in the distance and said to
him, "Come, good fellow! Welcome, good fellow! It's been a long time
since you took the opportunity to come here. For this is permanent, this
is everlasting, this is eternal, this is complete, this is not liable to
pass away. For this is where there's no being born, growing old, dying,
passing away, or being reborn. And there's no other escape beyond this."

When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him, "Alas, Baka the Divinity is
lost in ignorance! Alas, Baka the Divinity is lost in ignorance! Because
what is actually impermanent, not lasting, transient, incomplete, and
liable to pass away, he says is permanent, everlasting, eternal,
complete, and not liable to pass away. And where there is being born,
growing old, dying, passing away, and being reborn, he says that there's
no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And
although there is another escape beyond this, he says that there's no
other escape beyond this."

> "Gotama, we seventy-two merit-makers\
> \>are now wielders of power,\
> having passed beyond rebirth and old age.\
> This is our last rebirth as the Divinity,\
> \>O knowledge master.\
> And now many people pray to us."
>
> "But, Baka, the lifespan here is short, not long,\
> though you think it's long.\
> I know that your lifespan\
> is two quinquadecillion years, Divinity."
>
> "Blessed One, I am the one of infinite vision,\
> who has gone beyond rebirth and old age and sorrow.\
> What precepts and observances\
> \>did I practice in the past?\
> Explain to me so that I may understand."
>
> "You gave drink to many people\
> who were oppressed by thirst and heat.\
> They're the precepts and observances\
> \>you practiced in the past.\
> I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep.
>
> When people at Deer River Bank were seized,\
> you released the captives as they were led away.\
> That's the precepts and observances\
> \>you practiced in the past.\
> I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep.
>
> When a boat on the Ganges River was seized\
> by a fierce dragon desiring human flesh,\
> you freed it wielding mighty force.\
> That's the precepts and observances\
> \>you practiced in the past.\
> I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep.
>
> I used to be your servant named Kappa.\
> You thought he was intelligent and loyal.\
> That's the precepts and observances\
> \>you practiced in the past.\
> I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep."
>
> "You certainly understand this lifespan of mine.\
> And others, too, you know;\
> \>that's why you're the Buddha.\
> And that's why your blazing glory\
> lights up even the realm of divinity."

### N 6.5 A Certain Divinity *Aññatarabrahmasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time a certain divinity had the following harmful
misconception: "No ascetic or brahmin can come here!"

Then the Buddha knew what that divinity was thinking. As easily as a
strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from
Jeta's Grove and reappeared in that realm of divinity. Then the Buddha
sat cross-legged in the air above that Divinity, having entered upon the
fire element.

Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna thought, "Where is the Buddha
staying at present?" With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman,
he saw the Buddha seated cross-legged in the air above that Divinity,
having entered upon the fire element. Then, as easily as a strong person
would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from Jeta's Grove and
reappeared in that realm of divinity. Then
Mahāmoggallāna---positioning himself in the east, below the
Buddha---sat cross-legged in the air above that Divinity, having entered
upon the fire element.

Then Venerable Mahākassapa ... positioned himself in the
south ...

Venerable Mahākappina ... positioned himself in the west
...

Venerable Anuruddha ... positioned himself in the north, below the
Buddha, sitting cross-legged in the air above that Divinity, having
entered upon the fire element.

Then Mahāmoggallāna addressed that Divinity in verse:

> "Good sir, do you still have the same view\
> that you had in the past?\
> Or do you see the radiance\
> transcending the realm of divinity?"
>
> "Good fellow, I don't have that view\
> that I had in the past.\
> I see the radiance\
> transcending the realm of divinity.\
> So how could I say today\
> that I am permanent and eternal?"

Having inspired a sense of awe in the Divinity, as easily as a strong
person would extend or contract their arm, the Buddha vanished from the
realm of divinity and reappeared in Jeta's Grove.

Then that Divinity addressed a member of his retinue, "Please, good
fellow, go up to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna and say to him:
'Moggallāna my good fellow, are there any other disciples
of the Buddha who have power and might comparable to the worthies
Moggallāna, Kassapa, Kappina, and Anuruddha?'"

"Yes, good fellow," replied that retinue member. He went to
Moggallāna and asked as instructed.

Then Mahāmoggallāna addressed that member of the retinue of
Divinity in verse:

> "There are many disciples of the Buddha\
> who have the three knowledges,\
> and have attained psychic power,\
> \>expert in reading minds,\
> they're perfected ones with defilements ended."

Then that member of the retinue of Divinity, having approved and agreed
with what Mahāmoggallāna said, went to that Divinity and
said to him, "Good fellow, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said
this:

> 'There are many disciples of the Buddha\
> who have the three knowledges,\
> and have attained psychic power,\
> \>expert in reading minds,\
> they're perfected ones with defilements ended.'"

That's what that member of the retinue of Divinity said. Satisfied, that
Divinity approved what the member of his retinue said.

### N 6.6 The Negligent Divinity *Brahmalokasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time the Buddha had gone into retreat for the day's
meditation.

Then the independent divinities Subrahmā and
Suddhāvāsa went to the Buddha and stationed themselves one
by each door-post. But Subrahmā said to
Suddhāvāsa, "Good fellow, it's the wrong time to pay homage
to the Buddha. He has gone into retreat for the day's meditation. But
such and such realm of divinity is successful and prosperous, while the
divinity living there is negligent. Come, let's go to that realm of
divinity and inspire awe in that Divinity!"

"Yes, good fellow," replied Suddhāvāsa.

Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm,
they vanished from in front of the Buddha and appeared in that realm of
divinity.

That divinity saw those divinities coming off in the distance and said
to them, "Well now, good fellows, where have you come from?"

"Good fellow, we've come from the presence of the Blessed One, the
perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. Shouldn't you go to attend on
that Blessed One?"

When they had spoken, that divinity refused to accept their advice. He
multiplied himself a thousand times and said to Subrahmā,
"Good fellow, can't you see that I have such psychic power?"

"I see that, good fellow."

"Since I have such psychic power and might, what other ascetic or
brahmin should I go to and attend upon?"

Then Subrahmā multiplied himself two thousand times and
said to that Divinity, "Good fellow, can't you see that I have such
psychic power?"

"I see that, good fellow."

"That Buddha has even more psychic power and might than you or me.
Shouldn't you go to attend on that Blessed One?"

Then that divinity addressed Subrahmā in verse:

> "There are three hundreds of phoenixes,\
> \>four of swans, and five of eagles.\
> This palace belongs to him who practiced absorption.\
> It shines, Divinity,\
> lighting up the northern quarter!"
>
> "So what if your palace shines,\
> lighting up the northern quarter?\
> A clever person who has seen the deficiency in form,\
> its chronic trembling, takes no pleasure in it."

Then after inspiring awe in that divinity, the independent divinities
Subrahmā and Suddhāvāsa vanished right there.
And after some time that divinity went to attend on the Buddha.

### N 6.7 About Kokālika *Kokālikasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time the Buddha had gone into retreat for the day's
meditation. Then the independent divinities Subrahmā and
Suddhāvāsa went to the Buddha and stationed themselves one
by each door-post.

Then Subrahmā recited this verse about the mendicant
Kokālika in the Buddha's presence:

> "What wise person here would judge\
> the immeasurable by measuring them?\
> I think anyone who'd do such a thing\
> must be an ordinary person, shrouded in darkness."

### N 6.8 About Katamorakatissaka *Katamodakatissasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time the Buddha had gone into retreat for the day's
meditation. Then the independent divinities Subrahmā and
Suddhāvāsa went to the Buddha and stationed themselves one
by each door-post.

Then Suddhāvāsa recited this verse about the mendicant
Katamorakatissaka in the Buddha's presence:

> "What wise person here would judge\
> the immeasurable by measuring them?\
> I think anyone who'd do such a thing\
> must be a fool, shrouded in darkness."

### N 6.9 With the Divinity Tudu *Turūbrahmasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time the mendicant Kokālika was sick,
suffering, gravely ill.

Then, late at night, the beautiful independent divinity Tudu, lighting
up the entire Jeta's Grove, went up to the mendicant
Kokālika, and standing in the air he said to him,
"Kokālika, have confidence in Sāriputta and
Moggallāna, they're good monks."

"Who are you, reverend?"

"I am Tudu the independent divinity."

"Didn't the Buddha declare you a non-returner? So what exactly are you
doing back here? See how far you have strayed!"

> "A man is born\
> with an axe in his mouth.\
> A fool cuts themselves with it\
> when they say bad words.
>
> When you praise someone worthy of criticism,\
> or criticize someone worthy of praise,\
> you choose bad luck with your own mouth:\
> you'll never find happiness that way.
>
> Bad luck at dice is a trivial thing,\
> if all you lose is your money\
> and all you own, even yourself.\
> What's really terrible luck\
> is to hate the holy ones.
>
> For more than two quinquadecillion years,\
> and another five quattuordecillion years,\
> a slanderer of noble ones goes to hell,\
> having aimed bad words and thoughts at them."

### N 6.10 With Kokālika *Kokālikasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then the mendicant Kokālika went up to the Buddha, bowed,
sat down to one side, and said to him, "Sir, Sāriputta and
Moggallāna have corrupt wishes. They've fallen under the
sway of corrupt wishes."

When this was said, the Buddha said to Kokālika, "Don't say
that, Kokālika! Don't say that, Kokālika! Have
confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna,
they're good monks."

For a second time Kokālika said to the Buddha, "Despite my
faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and
Moggallāna have corrupt wishes. They've fallen under the
sway of corrupt wishes."

For a second time, the Buddha said to Kokālika, "Don't say
that, Kokālika! Don't say that, Kokālika! Have
confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna,
they're good monks."

For a third time Kokālika said to the Buddha, "Despite my
faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and
Moggallāna have corrupt wishes. They've fallen under the
sway of corrupt wishes."

For a third time, the Buddha said to Kokālika, "Don't say
that, Kokālika! Don't say that, Kokālika! Have
confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna,
they're good monks."

Then Kokālika got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully
circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. Not long
after he left his body erupted with boils the size of mustard seeds. The
boils grew to the size of mung beans, then chickpeas, then jujube seeds,
then jujubes, then myrobalans, then unripe wood-apples, then ripe
wood-apples. Finally they burst open, and pus and blood oozed out. Then
the mendicant Kokālika died of that illness. He was reborn
in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for
Sāriputta and Moggallāna.

Then, late at night, the beautiful divinity Sahampati, lighting up the
entire Jeta's Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side,
and said to him, "Sir, the mendicant Kokālika has passed
away. He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for
Sāriputta and Moggallāna."

That's what the divinity Sahampati said. Then he bowed and respectfully
circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing
right there.

Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that
had happened.

When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha, "Sir, how
long is the lifespan in the Pink Lotus hell?"

"It's long, mendicant. It's not easy to calculate how many years, how
many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it lasts."

"But sir, is it possible to give a simile?"

"It's possible," said the Buddha.

"Suppose there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed.
And at the end of every hundred years someone would remove a single seed
from it. By this means the Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame
seed would run out faster than a single lifetime in the Abbuda hell.

Now, twenty lifetimes in the Abbuda hell equal one lifetime in the
Nirabbuda hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Nirabbuda hell equal one
lifetime in the Ababa hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Ababa hell equal one
lifetime in the Aṭaṭa hell. Twenty lifetimes in the
Aṭaṭa hell equal one lifetime in the Ahaha hell. Twenty
lifetimes in the Ahaha hell equal one lifetime in the Yellow Lotus hell.
Twenty lifetimes in the Yellow Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the
Sweet-Smelling hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Sweet-Smelling hell equal
one lifetime in the Blue Water Lily hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Blue
Water Lily hell equal one lifetime in the White Lotus hell. Twenty
lifetimes in the White Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Pink Lotus
hell.

The mendicant Kokālika has been reborn in the Pink Lotus
hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and
Moggallāna."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "A man is born\
> with an axe in his mouth.\
> A fool cuts themselves with it\
> when they say bad words.
>
> When you praise someone worthy of criticism,\
> or criticize someone worthy of praise,\
> you choose bad luck with your own mouth:\
> you'll never find happiness that way.
>
> Bad luck at dice is a trivial thing,\
> if all you lose is your money\
> and all you own, even yourself.\
> What's really terrible luck\
> is to hate the holy ones.
>
> For more than two quinquadecillion years,\
> and another five quattuordecillion years,\
> a slanderer of noble ones goes to hell,\
> having aimed bad words and thoughts at them."

## Chapter Two

### N 6.11 With Sanaṅkumāra *Sanaṅkumārasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, on the bank of the Sappinī river.

Then, late at night, the beautiful divinity Sanaṅkumāra,
lighting up the entire Sappinī riverbank, went up to the
Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and recited this verse in the Buddha's
presence:

> "The aristocrat is best among people\
> who take clan as the standard.\
> But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct\
> is best among gods and humans."

That's what the divinity Sanaṅkumāra said, and the teacher
approved. Then the divinity Sanaṅkumāra, knowing that the
teacher approved, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him
on his right, before vanishing right there.

### N 6.12 About Devadatta *Devadattasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, on the Vulture's Peak Mountain, not long after
Devadatta had left.

Then, late at night, the beautiful divinity Sahampati, lighting up the
entire Vulture's Peak, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side,
and recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "The banana tree is destroyed by its own fruit,\
> as are the bamboo and the reed.\
> Honor destroys a sinner,\
> as pregnancy destroys a mule."

### N 6.13 At Andhakavinda *Andhakavindasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans at
Andhakavinda.

Now at that time the Buddha was meditating in the open during the dark
of night, while a gentle rain drizzled down.

Then, late at night, the beautiful divinity Sahampati, lighting up the
entirety of Andhakavinda, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one
side, and recited these verses in the Buddha's presence:

> "One should frequent secluded lodgings,\
> and practice to be released from fetters.\
> If you don't find enjoyment there,\
> live in the Saṅgha, guarded and mindful.
>
> Walking for alms from family to family,\
> with senses guarded, alert and mindful.\
> One should frequent secluded lodgings,\
> free of fear, freed in the fearless.
>
> Where dreadful serpents slither,\
> where the lightning flashes and the heavens thunder\
> in the dark of the night;\
> there meditates a mendicant, free of goosebumps.
>
> For this is ever seen by me,\
> it isn't just what the testament says.\
> Within a single spiritual dispensation\
> a thousand are conquerors of Death.
>
> And of trainees there are more than five hundred,\
> and ten times ten tens;\
> all are stream-enterers,\
> freed from rebirth in the animal realm.
>
> And as for the rest of folk\
> who I think have shared in merit---\
> I couldn't even number them,\
> for fear of speaking falsely."

### N 6.14 About Aruṇavatī *Aruṇavatīsutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī. There he addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a king named
Aruṇavā. He had a capital named Aruṇavatī.
Sikhī the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully
awakened Buddha lived supported by Aruṇavatī.
Sikhī had a fine pair of chief disciples named
Abhibhū and Sambhava.

Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant
Abhibhū, 'Come, brahmin, let's go to one of the realms of
divinity until it's time for our meal.'

'Yes, sir,' replied Abhibhū. Then, as easily as a strong
person would extend or contract their arm, they vanished from
Aruṇavatī and appeared in that realm of divinity.

Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant
Abhibhū, 'Brahmin, teach the Dhamma as you feel inspired
for that Divinity, his assembly, and the members of his retinue.'

'Yes, sir,' replied Abhibhū. Then he educated, encouraged,
fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk.

But the Divinity, his assembly, and his retinue complained, grumbled,
and objected, 'Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing! How on earth can a
disciple teach Dhamma in the presence of the Teacher?'

Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant
Abhibhū, 'Brahmin, the Divinity, his assembly, and his
retinue are complaining that a disciple teaches Dhamma in the presence
of the Teacher. Well then, brahmin, stir them up even more!'

'Yes, sir,' replied Abhibhū. Then he taught Dhamma with his
body visible; with his body invisible; with the lower half visible and
the upper half invisible; and with the upper half visible and the lower
half invisible.

And the Divinity, his assembly, and his retinue, their minds full of
wonder and amazement, thought, 'Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!
The ascetic has such psychic power and might!'

Then Abhibhū said to the Buddha Sikhī, 'Sir, I
recall having said this in the middle of the Saṅgha:
"Standing in the realm of divinity, I can make my voice heard throughout
the thousandfold galaxy."'

'Now is the time, brahmin! Now is the time, brahmin! Standing in the
realm of divinity, make your voice heard throughout the thousandfold
galaxy.'

'Yes, sir,' replied Abhibhū. Standing in the realm of
divinity, he recited this verse:

> 'Rouse yourselves! Try harder!\
> Devote yourselves to the teachings of the Buddha!\
> Crush the army of Death,\
> as an elephant a hut of reeds.
>
> Whoever shall meditate diligently\
> in this teaching and training,\
> giving up transmigration through rebirths,\
> will make an end of suffering.'

Having inspired that Divinity, his assembly, and his retinue with a
sense of awe, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract
their arm, Sikhī and Abhibhū vanished from
that realm of divinity and appeared in Aruṇavatī.

Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicants,
'Mendicants, did you hear the mendicant Abhibhū speaking a
verse while standing in a realm of divinity?'

'We did, sir.'

'But what exactly did you hear?'

'This is what we heard, sir:

> "Rouse yourselves! Try harder!\
> Devote yourselves to the teachings of the Buddha!\
> Crush the army of Death,\
> as an elephant a hut of reeds.
>
> Whoever shall meditate diligently\
> in this teaching and training,\
> giving up transmigration through rebirths,\
> will make an end of suffering."

That's what we heard, sir.'

'Good, good, mendicants! It's good that you heard the mendicant
Abhibhū speaking this verse while standing in a realm of
divinity.'"

That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants approved what
the Buddha said.

### N 6.15 Full Extinguishment *Parinibbānasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying between a pair of sal trees in the
sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near Kusinārā at the
time of his full extinguishment.

Then the Buddha said to the mendicants: "Come now, mendicants, I say to
you all: 'Conditions fall apart. Persist with diligence.'"

These were the Realized One's last words.

Then the Buddha entered the first absorption. Emerging from that, he
entered the second absorption. Emerging from that, he successively
entered into and emerged from the third absorption, the fourth
absorption, the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite
consciousness, the dimension of nothingness, and the dimension of
neither perception nor non-perception. Then he entered the cessation of
perception and feeling.

Then he emerged from the cessation of perception and feeling and entered
the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Emerging from
that, he successively entered into and emerged from the dimension of
nothingness, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of
infinite space, the fourth absorption, the third absorption, the second
absorption, and the first absorption. Emerging from that, he
successively entered into and emerged from the second absorption and the
third absorption. Then he entered the fourth absorption. Emerging from
that the Buddha immediately became fully extinguished.

When the Buddha was fully quenched, along with the full extinguishment,
the divinity Sahampati recited this verse:

> "All creatures in this world\
> must lay down this bag of bones.\
> For even a Teacher such as this,\
> unrivaled in the world,\
> the Realized One, attained to power,\
> the Buddha was fully quenched."

When the Buddha was fully quenched, Sakka, lord of gods, recited this
verse:

> "Oh! Conditions are impermanent,\
> their nature is to rise and fall;\
> having arisen, they cease;\
> their stilling is blissful."

When the Buddha was fully quenched, Venerable Ānanda recited this verse:

> "Then there was terror!\
> Then they had goosebumps!\
> When the Buddha, endowed with all fine qualities,\
> was fully quenched."

When the Buddha was fully quenched, Venerable Anuruddha recited this
verse:

> "There was no more breathing\
> for the unaffected one of steady heart.\
> Imperturbable, committed to peace,\
> the Clear-eyed One was fully quenched.
>
> He put up with painful feelings\
> without flinching.\
> The liberation of his heart\
> was like the extinguishing of a lamp."



# Linked Discourses with Brahmins

## The Chapter on the Perfected Ones

### N 7.1 With Dhanañjānī *Dhanañjānīsutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding
ground.

Now at that time a certain brahmin lady of the Bhāradvāja
clan named Dhanañjānī was devoted to the Buddha, the
teaching, and the Saṅgha. Once, while she was bringing her
husband his meal, she tripped and expressed this heartfelt sentiment
three times:

"Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened
Buddha!

Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened
Buddha!

Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened
Buddha!"

When she said this, the brahmin said to Dhanañjānī:

"That'd be right. For the slightest thing this lowlife woman spouts out
praise for that bald ascetic. Right now, lowlife woman, I'm going to
refute your teacher's doctrine!"

"Brahmin, I don't see anyone in this world---with its gods,
Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics
and brahmins, its gods and humans---who can refute the doctrine of the
Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. But anyway,
you should go. When you've gone you'll understand."

Then the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan, angry and upset,
went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings
and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and
addressed the Buddha in verse:

> "When what is incinerated do you sleep at ease?\
> When what is incinerated is there no sorrow?\
> What is the one thing\
> whose killing you approve?"
>
> "When anger's incinerated you sleep at ease.\
> When anger's incinerated there is no sorrow.\
> O brahmin, anger has a poisonous root\
> and a honey tip.\
> The noble ones praise its killing,\
> for when it's incinerated there is no sorrow."

When he said this, the brahmin said to the Buddha, "Excellent, worthy
Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing
the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in
the dark so people with clear eyes can see what's there, worthy Gotama
has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the worthy
Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. May I
receive the going forth, the ordination in the worthy Gotama's
presence?"

And the brahmin received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha's
presence. Not long after his ordination, Venerable
Bhāradvāja, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and
resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this
very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for
which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.

He understood: "Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been
completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further
for this place." And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the
perfected.

### N 7.2 The Abuser *Akkosasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the
Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding ground.

The brahmin Bhāradvāja the Rude heard a rumor that a
brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan had gone forth from the lay
life to homelessness in the presence of the ascetic Gotama. Angry and
displeased he went to the Buddha and abused and insulted him with rude,
harsh words. When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him:

"What do you think, brahmin? Do friends and colleagues, relatives and
kin, and guests still come to visit you?"

"Sometimes they do, worthy Gotama."

"Do you then serve them with fresh and cooked foods and savories?"

"Sometimes I do."

"But if they don't accept it, brahmin, who does it belong to?"

"In that case it still belongs to me."

"In the same way, brahmin, when you abuse, harass, and attack us who do
not abuse, harass, and attack, we don't accept it. It still belongs to
you, brahmin, it still belongs to you!

Someone who, when abused, harassed, and attacked, abuses, harasses, and
attacks in return is said to eat the food and have a reaction to it. But
we neither eat your food nor do we have a reaction to it. It still
belongs to you, brahmin, it still belongs to you!"

"Concerning the worthy Gotama, the king and his retinue understand, 'the
ascetic Gotama is a perfected one'. And yet he still gets angry."

> "From where would come anger for one free of anger,\
> tamed, living justly,\
> freed by right knowledge,\
> peaceful and unaffected?
>
> When you get angry at an angry person\
> you just make things worse for yourself.\
> When you don't get angry at an angry person\
> you win a battle hard to win.
>
> When you know that the other is angry,\
> you act for the good of both\
> yourself and the other\
> if you're mindful and stay calm.
>
> People unfamiliar with the teaching\
> consider one who heals both\
> oneself and the other\
> to be a fool."

When he had spoken, Bhāradvāja the Rude said to the Buddha,
"Excellent, worthy Gotama! ... I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to
the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. Sir, may I
receive the going forth, the ordination in the worthy Gotama's
presence?"

And the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Rude received the going
forth, the ordination in the Buddha's presence. Not long after his
ordination, Venerable Bhāradvāja the Rude, living alone,
withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end
of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with
his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the
lay life to homelessness.

He understood: "Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been
completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further
for this place." And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the
perfected.

### N 7.3 With Bhāradvāja the Fiend *Asurindakasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the
Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding ground. The brahmin
Bhāradvāja the Fiend heard a rumor to the effect that a
brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan had gone forth from the lay
life to homelessness in the presence of the ascetic Gotama. Angry and
displeased he went to the Buddha and abused and insulted him with rude,
harsh words.

But when he said this, the Buddha kept silent.

Then Bhāradvāja the Fiend said to the Buddha, "You're
beaten, ascetic, you're beaten!"

> "'Ha! I won!' thinks the fool,\
> when speaking with harsh words.\
> Patience is the true victory\
> for those who understand.
>
> When you get angry at an angry person\
> you just make things worse for yourself.\
> When you don't get angry at an angry person\
> you win a battle hard to win.
>
> When you know that the other is angry,\
> you act for the good of both\
> yourself and the other\
> if you're mindful and stay calm.
>
> People unskilled in Dhamma\
> consider one who heals both\
> oneself and the other\
> to be a fool."

When he had spoken, Bhāradvāja the Fiend said to the
Buddha, "Excellent, worthy Gotama! ..." ... And Venerable
Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected.

### N 7.4 With Bhāradvāja the Bitter *Bilaṅgikasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the
Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding ground. The brahmin
Bhāradvāja the Bitter heard a rumor that a brahmin of the
Bhāradvāja clan had gone forth from the lay life to
homelessness in the presence of the ascetic Gotama. Angry and displeased
he went to the Buddha and stood silently to one side.

Then the Buddha, knowing Bhāradvāja the Bitter's train of
thought, addressed him in verse:

> "Whoever wrongs a man who has done no wrong,\
> a pure man who has not a blemish,\
> the evil backfires on the fool,\
> like fine dust thrown upwind."

When he said this, the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Bitter said
to the Buddha, "Excellent, worthy Gotama! ..." ... And Venerable
Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected.

### N 7.5 Harmless *Ahiṁsakasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Harmless went up to the
Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.

When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one
side and said, "I am Harmless, worthy Gotama, I am Harmless!"

> "If you were really like your name,\
> then you'd be Harmless.\
> But a truly harmless person\
> does no harm by way of\
> body, speech, or mind;\
> they don't harm anyone else."

When he had spoken, the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Harmless
said to the Buddha, "Excellent, worthy Gotama! ..." ... And Venerable
Bhāradvāja the Harmless became one of the perfected.

### N 7.6 With Bhāradvāja of the Matted Hair *Jaṭāsutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then the brahmin Bhāradvāja of the Matted Hair went up to
the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.

When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one
side, and addressed the Buddha in verse:

> "Tangled within, tangled without:\
> these people are tangled in tangles.\
> I ask you this, Gotama:\
> who can untangle this tangle?"
>
> "A wise person grounded in ethics,\
> developing the mind and wisdom,\
> a keen and alert mendicant---\
> they can untangle this tangle.
>
> Those in whom greed, hate, and ignorance\
> have faded away;\
> the perfected ones with defilements ended---\
> they have untangled the tangle.
>
> Where name and form\
> cease with nothing left over;\
> as well as impingement and perception of form:\
> it's there that the tangle is cut."

When he had spoken, Bhāradvāja of the Matted Hair said to
the Buddha, "Excellent, worthy Gotama! ..." ... And Venerable
Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected.

### N 7.7 With Bhāradvāja the Pure *Suddhikasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Pure went up to the Buddha,
and exchanged greetings with him.

When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one
side, and recited this verse in his presence:

> "No brahmin in the world is ever purified\
> even though he's ethical and mortifies himself.\
> But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct\
> is purified, not these commoners."
>
> "Even one who mutters many prayers\
> is no brahmin by birth\
> if they're filthy and corrupt within,\
> supporting themselves by fraud.
>
> Regardless of whether you're an aristocrat,\
> a brahmin, peasant, menial,\
> \>or a corpse-worker or scavenger---\
> if you're energetic and resolute,\
> always staunchly vigorous,\
> you'll attain ultimate purity.\
> Know that for a fact, brahmin."

When he had spoken, the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Pure said to
the Buddha, "Excellent, worthy Gotama ..." ... And Venerable
Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected.

### N 7.8 With Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper *Aggikasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the
Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding ground.

Now at that time ghee and milk-rice had been set out for the brahmin
Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper, who thought, "I will serve
the sacred flame! I will perform the fire sacrifice!"

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
entered Rājagaha for alms. Wandering indiscriminately for
almsfood in Rājagaha, he approached Bhāradvāja
the Fire-Worshiper's home and stood to one side.

Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper saw him standing for alms and
addressed him in verse:

> "One who's accomplished in the three knowledges,\
> of good birth and ample learning,\
> accomplished in knowledge and conduct\
> may enjoy this milk-rice."
>
> "Even one who mutters many prayers\
> is no brahmin by birth\
> if they're filthy and corrupt within,\
> with a following gained by fraud.
>
> One who knows their past lives,\
> sees heaven and places of loss,\
> and has attained the ending of rebirth,\
> is a sage of perfect insight.
>
> Because of these three knowledges\
> a brahmin is a master of the three knowledges.\
> Accomplished in knowledge and conduct,\
> they may enjoy this milk-rice."

"Eat, worthy Gotama! you are truly a brahmin."

> "Food enchanted by a verse isn't fit for me to eat.\
> That's not the principle of those who see, brahmin.\
> The Buddhas reject things enchanted with verses.\
> Since there is such a principle, brahmin,\
> \>that's how they live.
>
> Serve with other food and drink\
> the consummate one, the great seer,\
> with defilements ended and remorse stilled.\
> For he is the field for the seeker of merit."

When he had spoken, the brahmin Bhāradvāja the
Fire-Worshiper said to the Buddha, "Excellent, worthy Gotama! ..." ...
And Venerable Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper became one of
the perfected.

### N 7.9 With Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā *Sundarikasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the Kosalan lands on the bank of
the Sundarikā river.

Now at that time the brahmin Bhāradvāja of
Sundarikā was serving the sacred flame and performing the
fire sacrifice on the bank of the Sundarikā.

Then he looked all around the four quarters, wondering, "Now who might
eat the leftovers of this offering?"

He saw the Buddha meditating at the root of a certain tree with his robe
pulled over his head. Taking the leftovers of the offering in his left
hand and a pitcher in the right he approached the Buddha. When he heard
Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā's footsteps the Buddha
uncovered his head.

Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā thought, "This man is
shaven, he is shaven!" And he wanted to turn back.

But he thought, "Even some brahmins are shaven. Why don't I go to him
and ask about his birth?"

Then the brahmin Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā went
up to the Buddha, and said to him, "Sir, what are you by birth?"

> "Don't ask about birth, ask about conduct;\
> for the fire of Jātaveda is born from kindling.\
> A steadfast sage, even though from a low class family,\
> is a thoroughbred checked by conscience.
>
> Tamed by truth, fulfilled by taming,\
> a complete knowledge master\
> \>who has completed the spiritual journey---\
> that's who a sacrificer\
> \>should introduce themselves to,\
> and make a timely offering\
> \>to one worthy of a religious donation."
>
> "My sacrificial offering\
> \>must have been well performed,\
> since I have met such a knowledge master!\
> It's because I'd never met anyone like you\
> that others ate the leftover offering.

Eat, worthy Gotama, you are truly a brahmin."

> "Food enchanted by a verse isn't fit for me to eat.\
> That's not the principle of those who see, brahmin.\
> The Buddhas reject things enchanted with verses.\
> Since there is such a principle, brahmin,\
> \>that's how they live.
>
> Serve with other food and drink\
> the consummate one, the great seer,\
> with defilements ended and remorse stilled.\
> For he is the field for the seeker of merit."

"Then, worthy Gotama, to whom should I give the leftovers of this
offering?"

"Brahmin, I don't see anyone in this world---with its gods,
Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics
and brahmins, its gods and humans---who can properly digest these
leftovers, except for the Realized One or one of his disciples. Well
then, brahmin, throw out those leftovers where there is little that
grows, or drop them into water that has no living creatures."

So Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā dropped the
leftover offering in water that had no living creatures. And when those
leftovers were placed in the water, they sizzled and hissed, steaming
and fuming. Suppose there was an iron cauldron that had been heated all
day. If you placed it in the water, it would sizzle and hiss, steaming
and fuming. In the same way, when those leftovers were placed in the
water, they sizzled and hissed, steaming and fuming.

Then the brahmin Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā,
shocked and awestruck, went up to the Buddha, and stood to one side. The
Buddha addressed him in verse:

> "When you're kindling the wood, brahmin,\
> don't imagine this is purity, for it's just an external.\
> For those who are skilled say this is no way to purity,\
> when one seeks purity in externals.
>
> I've given up kindling firewood, brahmin,\
> now I just light the inner flame.\
> Always blazing, always serene,\
> I am a perfected one leading the spiritual life.
>
> Conceit, brahmin, is the burden of your possessions,\
> anger your smoke, and lies your ashes.\
> The tongue is the ladle and the heart the fire altar;\
> a well-tamed self is a person's light.
>
> The teaching is a lake with shores of ethics, brahmin,\
> unclouded, praised by the fine to the good.\
> There the knowledge masters go to bathe,\
> and cross to the far shore without getting wet.
>
> Truth, principle, restraint, the spiritual life;\
> the attainment of the supreme based on the middle,\
> \>brahmin.\
> Pay homage to the sincere ones---\
> I declare that man to be\
> \>one who follows the teaching."

When he had spoken, the brahmin Bhāradvāja of
Sundarikā said to the Buddha, "Excellent, worthy Gotama
..." ... And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the
perfected.

### N 7.10 Many Daughters *Bahudhītarasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a
certain forest grove.

Now at that time one of the brahmins of the Bhāradvāja clan
had lost fourteen oxen. While looking for them he went to that forest
grove, where he saw the Buddha sitting down cross-legged, his body set
straight, and mindfulness established in his presence. He went up to the
Buddha, and recited these verses in the Buddha's presence:

> "This ascetic mustn't have\
> fourteen oxen\
> missing for the past six days:\
> that's why this ascetic is happy.
>
> This ascetic mustn't have\
> a field of sesame ruined,\
> with just one or two leaves:\
> that's why this ascetic is happy.
>
> This ascetic mustn't have\
> rats in a vacant barn\
> dancing merrily:\
> that's why this ascetic is happy.
>
> This ascetic mustn't have\
> carpets that for seven months\
> have been infested with fleas:\
> that's why this ascetic is happy.
>
> This ascetic mustn't have\
> seven widowed daughters\
> with one or two children each:\
> that's why this ascetic is happy.
>
> This ascetic mustn't have\
> a wife with sallow, blotchy skin\
> to wake him with a kick:\
> that's why this ascetic is happy.
>
> This ascetic mustn't have\
> creditors knocking at dawn,\
> warning, 'Pay up! Pay up!':\
> that's why this ascetic is happy."
>
> "You're right, brahmin, I don't have\
> fourteen oxen\
> missing for the past six days:\
> that's why I'm happy, brahmin.
>
> You're right, brahmin, I don't have\
> a field of sesame ruined,\
> with just one or two leaves:\
> that's why I'm happy, brahmin.
>
> You're right, brahmin, I don't have\
> rats in a vacant barn\
> dancing merrily:\
> that's why I'm happy, brahmin.
>
> You're right, brahmin, I don't have\
> carpets that for seven months\
> have been infested with fleas:\
> that's why I'm happy, brahmin.
>
> You're right, brahmin, I don't have\
> seven widowed daughters\
> with one or two children each:\
> that's why I'm happy, brahmin.
>
> You're right, brahmin, I don't have\
> a wife with blotchy, pockmarked skin\
> to wake me up with a kick:\
> that's why I'm happy, brahmin.
>
> You're right, brahmin, I don't have\
> creditors knocking at dawn,\
> warning, 'Pay up! Pay up!':\
> that's why I'm happy, brahmin."

When he had spoken, the brahmin said to the Buddha, "Excellent, worthy
Gotama! Excellent! ... As if he were righting the overturned, or
revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting
a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what's there,
worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge
to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant
Saṅgha. May I receive the going forth, the ordination in
the worthy Gotama's presence?"

And the brahmin received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha's
presence. Not long after his ordination, Venerable
Bhāradvāja, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and
resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this
very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for
which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.

He understood: "Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been
completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further
for this place." And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the
perfected.

## The Chapter on a Lay Follower

### N 7.11 With Bhāradvāja the Farmer *Kasibhāradvājasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in the
land of the Magadhans in the Southern Hills near the brahmin village of
Ekanāḷa.

Now at that time the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Farmer had
harnessed around five hundred plows, it being the season for sowing.
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
went to where Bhāradvāja the Farmer was working.

Now at that time Bhāradvāja the Farmer was distributing
food. Then the Buddha went to where the distribution was taking place
and stood to one side.

Bhāradvāja the Farmer saw him standing for alms and said to
him, "I plough and sow, ascetic, and then I eat. You too should plough
and sow, then you may eat."

"I too plough and sow, brahmin, and then I eat."

"I don't see the worthy Gotama with a yoke or plow or plowshare or goad
or oxen, yet he says: 'I too plough and sow, brahmin, and then I eat.'"

Then Bhāradvāja the Farmer addressed the Buddha in verse:

> "You claim to be a farmer,\
> but I don't see you farming.\
> Tell me how you're a farmer when asked:\
> how am I to recognize your farming?"
>
> "Faith is my seed, fervor my rain,\
> and wisdom is my yoke and plough.\
> Conscience is my pole, mind my strap,\
> mindfulness my plowshare and goad.
>
> Guarded in body and speech,\
> I restrict my intake of food.\
> I use truth as my scythe,\
> and sweetness is my release.
>
> Energy is my beast of burden,\
> transporting me to sanctuary from the yoke.\
> It goes without turning back\
> to where there is no sorrow.
>
> That's how to do the farming\
> that has freedom from death as its fruit.\
> When you finish this farming\
> you're released from all suffering."

"Eat, worthy Gotama, you are truly a farmer. For the worthy Gotama does
the farming that has freedom from death as its fruit."

> "Food enchanted by a verse isn't fit for me to eat.\
> That's not the principle of those who see, brahmin.\
> The Buddhas reject things enchanted with verses.\
> Since there is such a principle, brahmin,\
> \>that's how they live.
>
> Serve with other food and drink\
> the consummate one, the great seer,\
> with defilements ended and remorse stilled.\
> For he is the field for the seeker of merit."

When he had spoken, the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Farmer said
to the Buddha, "Excellent, worthy Gotama ... From this day forth, may
the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge
for life."

### N 7.12 With Udaya *Udayasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
went to the home of the brahmin Udaya. Then Udaya filled the Buddha's
bowl with rice. The next day ... and the day after that ... Udaya filled
the Buddha's bowl with rice.

But when he had filled the Buddha's bowl for a third time, he said to
the Buddha, "This insatiable ascetic Gotama keeps coming back again and
again!"

> "Again and again, they sow the seed;\
> again and again, the king of the heavens sends rain;\
> again and again, farmers plough the field;\
> again and again, grain is produced for the nation.
>
> Again and again, the beggars beg;\
> again and again, the donors give.\
> Again and again, when the donors have given,\
> again and again, they take their place in heaven.
>
> Again and again, dairy farmers milk;\
> again and again, a calf cleaves to its mother;\
> again and again, oppressing and intimidating;\
> that dullard returns to the womb again and again.
>
> Again and again, you're reborn and die;\
> again and again, you get carried to a charnel ground.\
> But when they've gained the path\
> \>for no further rebirth,\
> one of vast wisdom is not reborn again and again."

When he had spoken, the brahmin Udaya said to the Buddha, "Excellent,
worthy Gotama ... From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me
as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."

### N 7.13 With Devahita *Devahitasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time the Buddha was afflicted by winds. Venerable
Upavāna was his carer.

Then the Buddha said to Upavāna, "Please,
Upavāna, find some hot water for me."

"Yes, sir," replied Upavāna. He robed up, and, taking his
bowl and robe, went to the home of the brahmin Devahita, and stood
silently to one side.

Devahita saw him standing there and addressed him in verse:

> "Silent stands the good fellow,\
> shaven, wrapped in his outer robe.\
> What do you want? What are you looking for?\
> What have you come here to ask for?"
>
> "The perfected one, the Holy One in the world,\
> the sage is afflicted by winds.\
> If there's hot water,\
> give it to the sage, brahmin.
>
> I wish to bring it to the one\
> who is esteemed by the estimable,\
> honored by the honorable,\
> venerated by the venerable."

Then Devahita had a man fetch a carrying-pole with hot water. He also
presented Upavāna with a jar of molasses.

Then Venerable Upavāna went up to the Buddha and bathed him
with the hot water. Then he stirred molasses into hot water and
presented it to the Buddha. Then the Buddha's illness died down.

Then the brahmin Devahita went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings
with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat
down to one side, and addressed the Buddha in verse:

> "Where should you give an available gift?\
> Where is a gift very fruitful?\
> How does one who is donating\
> ensure the success of their religious donation?"
>
> "One who knows their past lives,\
> sees heaven and places of loss,\
> and has attained the ending of rebirth,\
> is a sage of perfect insight.
>
> Here you should give an available gift;\
> what's given here is very fruitful.\
> That's how a sponsor of sacrifices\
> ensures the success of their religious donation."

When he had spoken, the brahmin Devahita said to the Buddha, "Excellent,
worthy Gotama ... From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me
as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."

### N 7.14 A well-to-do brahmin *Mahāsālasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then a certain well-to-do brahmin, shabby, wearing a shabby cloak, went
up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.

When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one
side. The Buddha said to him, "Brahmin, why are you so shabby, wearing a
shabby cloak?"

"Worthy Gotama, I have four sons. At their wives' bidding they expelled
me from my house."

"Well then, brahmin, memorize these verses and recite them to your sons
when you are all seated in the council hall with a large crowd.

> 'I was overjoyed when they were born,\
> and wished for them the very best.\
> But at their wives' bidding they chased me out,\
> like hounds after hogs.
>
> It turns out they're wicked, those nasty men,\
> though they called me their dear old Dad.\
> They're monsters in the shape of sons,\
> throwing me out as I've grown old.
>
> Like an old, useless horse\
> led away from its fodder,\
> the elderly father of those kids\
> begs for alms at others' homes.
>
> Even my staff is better\
> than those disobedient sons,\
> for it wards off a wild bull,\
> and even a wild dog.
>
> It goes before me in the dark;\
> in deep waters it supports me.\
> By the wonderful power of this staff,\
> when I stumble, I stand firm again.'"

Having memorized those verses in the Buddha's presence, the brahmin
recited them to his sons when they were all seated in the council hall
with a large crowd. ...

Then the brahmin's sons led him back home, bathed him, and each clothed
him with a fine pair of garments. Then the brahmin, taking one pair of
garments, went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. When the
greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and
said to the Buddha:

"Worthy Gotama, we brahmins seek a fee for our tutor. May the worthy
Gotama please accept my tutor's fee!" So the Buddha accepted it out of
sympathy. Then the well-to-do brahmin said to the Buddha, "Excellent,
worthy Gotama ... From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me
as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."

### N 7.15 Stuck-Up *Mānatthaddhasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time a brahmin named Stuck-Up was residing in
Sāvatthī. He didn't bow to his mother or father, his tutor,
or his oldest brother. Now, at that time the Buddha was teaching Dhamma,
surrounded by a large assembly.

Then Stuck-Up thought, "The ascetic Gotama is teaching Dhamma,
surrounded by a large assembly. Why don't I approach him? If he speaks
to me, I'll speak to him. But if he doesn't speak, neither will I."

Then the brahmin Stuck-Up went up to the Buddha, and stood silently to
one side. But the Buddha didn't speak to him.

Then Stuck-Up thought, "This ascetic Gotama knows nothing!" And he
wanted to go back from there right away.

Then the Buddha, knowing Stuck-Up's train of thought, addressed him in
verse:

> "It's not good to foster conceit\
> if you want what's good for you, brahmin.\
> You should foster the goal\
> which brought you here."

Then Stuck-Up thought, "The ascetic Gotama knows my mind!" He bowed with
his head at the Buddha's feet, caressing them and covering them with
kisses, and pronounced his name: "Worthy Gotama, I am Stuck-Up! I am
Stuck-Up!"

Then that assembly was stunned: "Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!
This brahmin Stuck-Up doesn't bow to his mother or father, his tutor, or
his oldest brother. Yet he shows such utmost devotion to the ascetic
Gotama!"

Then the Buddha said to the brahmin Stuck-Up, "Enough, brahmin. Get up,
and take your own seat. For your mind has confidence in me."

Then Stuck-Up took his seat and said to the Buddha:

> "Regarding whom should you not be conceited?\
> Who should you respect?\
> Who should you esteem?\
> Who is it good to venerate properly?"
>
> "Your mother and father,\
> and also your oldest brother,\
> with tutor as fourth.\
> Regarding these you should not be conceited.\
> They are who you should respect.\
> They are who you should esteem.\
> And they're who it's good to venerate properly.
>
> And when you've humbled conceit,\
> \>and aren't stuck-up,\
> show supreme reverence for\
> the perfected ones, cooled,\
> their task complete, free of defilements."

When he had spoken, the brahmin Stuck-Up said to the Buddha, "Excellent,
worthy Gotama ... From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me
as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."

### N 7.16 The Contraphile *Paccanīkasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time a brahmin named Contraphile, who loved contradiction,
was residing in Sāvatthī.

Then Contraphile thought, "Why don't I go to the ascetic Gotama and
contradict everything he says?"

At that time the Buddha was walking mindfully in the open air.

Then the brahmin Contraphile went up to the Buddha, and said to him as
he was walking, "Ascetic, preach the Dhamma."

> "Fine words aren't easy to understand\
> by a lover of contradiction,\
> whose mind is tainted\
> and full of aggression.
>
> But when you've dispelled aggression,\
> and your suspicious mind,\
> and you've got rid of resentment,\
> then you'll understand fine words."

When he had spoken, the brahmin Contraphile said to the Buddha,
"Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent! ... From this day forth, may the
worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for
life."

### N 7.17 The Builder *Navakammikasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a
certain forest grove.

Now at that time the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Builder was
doing some building work in that jungle thicket. He saw the Buddha
sitting down cross-legged at the root of a certain sal tree, his body
set straight, and mindfulness established in his presence.

Seeing this, it occurred to him, "I enjoy doing this building work here
in the jungle. I wonder what the ascetic Gotama enjoys doing?"

Then Bhāradvāja the Builder went up to the Buddha and
addressed him in verse:

> "What kind of work do you do\
> as a mendicant in the sal jungle?\
> How do you find enjoyment\
> alone in the wilderness, Gotama?"
>
> "There's nothing I need to do in the jungle;\
> my jungle's cut down at the root, it's withered away.\
> With jungle cleared and free of thorns,\
> I enjoy being alone in the jungle,\
> \>having given up discontent."

When he had spoken, the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Builder said
to the Buddha, "Excellent, worthy Gotama ... From this day forth, may
the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge
for life."

### N 7.18 Collecting Firewood *Kaṭṭhahārasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a
certain forest grove.

Then several students, pupils of one of the Bhāradvāja
brahmins, approached a forest grove while collecting firewood. They saw
the Buddha sitting down cross-legged at the root of a certain sal tree,
his body set straight, and mindfulness established in his presence.
Seeing this, they went up to Bhāradvāja and said to him,
"Please sir, you should know this. In such and such a forest grove the
ascetic Gotama is sitting down cross-legged, his body set straight, and
mindfulness established in his presence."

Then Bhāradvāja together with those young students went to
that forest grove where he saw the Buddha sitting down cross-legged, his
body set straight, and mindfulness established in his presence.

He went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse:

> "Deep in the jungle so full of terrors,\
> you've plunged into the empty, desolate wilderness.\
> Still, steady, and graceful:\
> how beautifully you meditate, mendicant!
>
> Where there is no song or music,\
> a lonely sage resorts to the wilderness.\
> This strikes me as an amazing thing,\
> that you dwell so joyfully alone in the jungle.
>
> I suppose you wish to be reborn in the company\
> of the supreme sovereign\
> \>of the heaven of the Three and Thirty.\
> Is that why you resort to the desolate wilderness,\
> to practice fervor for attaining divinity?"
>
> "Any wishes and hopes that are always attached\
> to the many and various realms---\
> the yearnings sprung from the root of unknowing---\
> I've eliminated them all down to the root.
>
> So I'm wishless, unattached, disengaged;\
> amongst all things, my vision is clear.\
> I've attained the state of grace,\
> \>the supreme awakening;\
> I meditate alone, brahmin, and self-assured."

When he had spoken, Bhāradvāja said to the Buddha,
"Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent! ... From this day forth, may the
worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for
life."

### N 7.19 The Brahmin Who Provided for His Mother *Mātuposakasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then a brahmin who provided for his mother went up to the Buddha, and
exchanged greetings with him.

When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one
side and said to the Buddha, "Worthy Gotama, I seek alms by legitimate
means, which I use to provide for my mother and father. In doing so, am
I doing my duty?"

"Indeed, brahmin, in so doing you are doing your duty. Whoever seeks
alms by legitimate means, and uses them to provide for their mother and
father creates much merit.

> A mortal provides for their mother\
> and father by legitimate means;\
> because they look after\
> their parents like this,\
> they're praised in this life by the astute,\
> and they depart to rejoice in heaven."

When he said this, the brahmin who provided for his mother said to the
Buddha, "Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent! ... From this day forth,
may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for
refuge for life."

### N 7.20 A Beggar *Bhikkhakasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then a begging brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings
with him.

When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one
side and said to the Buddha, "Worthy Gotama, both you and I are beggars.
What, then, is the difference between us?"

> "You don't become a beggar\
> just by begging from others.\
> One who has undertaken domestic duties\
> has not yet become a mendicant.
>
> But one living a spiritual life\
> who has banished both merit and evil,\
> and wanders having appraised the world,\
> is said to be a mendicant."

When he had spoken, the begging brahmin said to the Buddha, "Excellent,
worthy Gotama! Excellent! ... From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama
remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."

### N 7.21 With Saṅgārava *Saṅgāravasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time there was a brahmin named Saṅgārava
staying in Sāvatthī. He practiced purification by water,
believing in purification by water. He lived committed to the practice
of immersing himself in water at dawn and dusk. Then Venerable Ānanda
robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered
Sāvatthī for alms.

He wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his
return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to him, "Sir, there is a brahmin named
Saṅgārava staying in Sāvatthī. He practices
purification by water, believing in purification by water. He lives
devoted to ritual bathing at dawn and dusk. Please visit him at his home
out of sympathy." The Buddha consented with silence.

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
went to the home of the brahmin Saṅgārava, and sat down on
the seat spread out. Then the brahmin Saṅgārava went up to
the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.

When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one
side. The Buddha said to him, "Is it really true, brahmin, that you
practice purification by water, believing in purification by water; that
you live committed to the practice of immersing yourself in water at
dawn and dusk?"

"Yes, worthy Gotama."

"But brahmin, for what reason do you practice purification by water?"

"It's because, worthy Gotama, whatever bad deeds I've done during the
day I wash off by bathing at dusk; and whatever bad deeds I've done
during the night, I wash off by bathing at dawn. That's the reason why I
practice purification by water."

> "The teaching is a lake with shores of ethics, brahmin,\
> unclouded, praised by the fine to the good.\
> There the knowledge masters go to bathe,\
> and cross to the far shore without getting wet."

When he had spoken, Saṅgārava said to the Buddha,
"Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent! ... From this day forth, may the
worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for
life."

### N 7.22 At Khomadussa *Khomadussasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in the
land of the Sakyans, where they have a town named Khomadussa.

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
entered Khomadussa for alms. Now at that time the brahmins and
householders of Khomadussa were gathered in the council hall for some
business, while a gentle rain drizzled down.

Then the Buddha approached that council. The brahmins and householders
saw the Buddha coming off in the distance, and said, "Who are these
shavelings, these fake ascetics? Don't they understand the council
rules?"

Then the Buddha addressed the brahmins and householders of Khomadussa in
verse:

> "If good people are not present it is no true council;\
> and those whose speak against principle\
> \>are not good people.\
> Having given up greed, hate, and delusion,\
> speakers of principle are good people."

When he had spoken, the brahmins and householders of Khomadussa said to
the Buddha, "Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting
the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the
lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see
what's there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. We
go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the
mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the worthy
Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life."



# Linked Discourses With Vaṅgīsa

## The Chapter with the Poet Vaṅgīsa

### N 8.1 Renounced *Nikkhantasutta*

So I have heard. At one time Venerable
Vaṅgīsa was staying near Āḷavī, at the
Aggāḷava Tree-shrine, together with his mentor, Venerable
Nigrodhakappa.

Now at that time Vaṅgīsa was junior, recently gone forth.
He had been left behind to look after the dwelling.

Then several women dressed in all their finery went to the monastery at
Aggāḷava in order to inspect the dwelling. When
Vaṅgīsa saw them he became dissatisfied, with lust
infecting his mind.

Then he thought, "It's my loss, my misfortune, that I've become
dissatisfied, with lust infecting my mind. How is it possible for
someone else to dispel my discontent and give rise to satisfaction? Why
don't I do it myself?"

Then, on the occasion of dispelling his own discontent and giving rise
to satisfaction, he recited these verses:

> "Now that I've renounced\
> the home life for homelessness\
> I'm overrun\
> by the rude thoughts of the Dark One.
>
> Even if a thousand mighty princes and great archers,\
> well trained, with strong bows,\
> were to completely surround me;\
> I would never flee.
>
> And even if women come,\
> many more than that,\
> they won't scare me,\
> for I stand firm in the teaching.
>
> I heard this with my own ears\
> from the Buddha, kinsman of the Sun,\
> about the path going to extinguishment;\
> that's what delights my mind.
>
> Wicked One, if you come near me\
> as I meditate like this,\
> I'll make sure that you, Death,\
> won't even see the path I take."

### N 8.2 Dissatisfaction *Aratīsutta*

At one time Venerable Vaṅgīsa was staying near
Āḷavī, at the Aggāḷava Tree-shrine, together
with his mentor, Venerable Nigrodhakappa.

Now at that time after Venerable Nigrodhakappa had finished his meal, on
his return from almsround, he would enter his dwelling and not emerge
for the rest of that day, or the next.

And at that time Venerable Vaṅgīsa became dissatisfied, as
lust infected his mind.

Then he thought, "It's my loss, my misfortune, that I've become
dissatisfied, with lust infecting my mind. How is it possible for
someone else to dispel my discontent and give rise to satisfaction? Why
don't I do it myself?"

Then, on the occasion of dispelling his own discontent and giving rise
to satisfaction, he recited these verses:

> "Giving up discontent and desire,\
> along with all thoughts of domestic life,\
> they wouldn't get entangled in anything;\
> unentangled, undesiring: that's a real mendicant.
>
> Whether here on earth or in the air,\
> whatever in the world is included in form\
> wears out, it is all impermanent;\
> the thoughtful live having comprehended this truth.
>
> People are bound to their attachments,\
> to what is seen, heard, felt, and thought.\
> Unstirred, dispel desire for these things;\
> for one called 'a sage' does not cling to them.
>
> Attached to the sixty wrong views,\
> \>and full of their own opinions,\
> ordinary people are fixed in wrong principles.\
> But that mendicant wouldn't join a sectarian group,\
> still less would they utter lewd speech.
>
> Clever, long serene,\
> free of deceit, alert, without envy,\
> the sage has reached the state of peace;\
> quenched, he awaits his time."

### N 8.3 Good-Hearted *Pesalasutta*

At one time Venerable Vaṅgīsa was staying near
Āḷavī, at the Aggāḷava Tree-shrine, together
with his mentor, Venerable Nigrodhakappa.

Now at that time Venerable Vaṅgīsa looked down upon other
good-hearted mendicants because of his own poetic virtuosity.

Then he thought, "It's my loss, my misfortune, that I look down on other
good-hearted mendicants because of my own poetic virtuosity."

Then, on the occasion of arousing remorse in himself, he recited these
verses:

> "Give up conceit, Gotama!\
> Completely abandon the different kinds of conceit!\
> Besotted with the different kinds of conceit,\
> you've had regrets for a long time.
>
> Smeared by smears and slain by conceit,\
> people fall into hell.\
> When people slain by conceit are reborn in hell,\
> they grieve for a long time.
>
> But a mendicant who practices rightly,\
> winner of the path, never grieves.\
> They enjoy happiness and a good reputation,\
> and they rightly call him a 'Seer of Truth'.
>
> So don't be hard-hearted, be energetic,\
> with hindrances given up, be pure.\
> Then with conceit given up completely,\
> use knowledge to make an end, and be calmed."

### N 8.4 With Ānanda *Ānandasutta*

At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and
robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms with Venerable
Vaṅgīsa as his second monk.

And at that time Venerable Vaṅgīsa became dissatisfied, as
lust infected his mind. Then he addressed Ānanda in verse:

> "I've got a burning desire for pleasure;\
> My mind is on fire!\
> Please, out of compassion, Gotama,\
> tell me how to quench the flames."
>
> "Your mind is on fire\
> because of a perversion of perception.\
> Turn away from the feature of things\
> that's attractive, provoking lust.
>
> See all conditioned phenomena as other,\
> as suffering and not-self.\
> Extinguish the great fire of lust,\
> don't burn up again and again.
>
> With mind unified and serene,\
> meditate on the ugly aspects of the body.\
> With mindfulness immersed in the body,\
> be full of disillusionment.
>
> Meditate on the signless,\
> give up the underlying tendency to conceit;\
> and when you comprehend conceit,\
> you will live at peace."

### N 8.5 Well-Spoken Words *Subhāsitasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, speech that has four factors is well spoken, not poorly
spoken. It's blameless and is not criticized by sensible people. What
four? It's when a mendicant speaks well, not poorly; they speak on the
teaching, not against the teaching; they speak pleasantly, not
unpleasantly; and they speak truthfully, not falsely. Speech with these
four factors is well spoken, not poorly spoken. It's blameless and is
not criticized by sensible people."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "Good people say well-spoken words are foremost;\
> second, speak on the teaching, not against it;\
> third, speak pleasantly, not unpleasantly;\
> and fourth, speak truthfully, not falsely."

Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his
robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and
said, "I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak,
Holy One!"

"Then speak as you feel inspired," said the Buddha.

Then Vaṅgīsa extolled the Buddha in his presence with
fitting verses:

> "Speak only such words\
> as do not hurt yourself\
> nor harm others;\
> such speech is truly well spoken.
>
> Speak only pleasing words,\
> words gladly welcomed.\
> Pleasing words are those\
> that bring nothing bad to others.
>
> Truth itself is the undying word:\
> this is an ancient teaching.\
> Good people say that the teaching and its meaning\
> are grounded in the truth.
>
> The words spoken by the Buddha\
> for finding the sanctuary, extinguishment,\
> for making an end of suffering:\
> this really is the best kind of speech."

### N 8.6 With Sāriputta *Sāriputtasutta*

At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery.

Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was educating,
encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants in the assembly
hall with a Dhamma talk. His words were polished, clear, articulate, and
expressed the meaning. And those mendicants were paying attention,
applying the mind, concentrating wholeheartedly, and actively listening.

Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa thought, "This Venerable
Sāriputta is educating the mendicants. ... And those
mendicants are paying attention, applying the mind, concentrating
wholeheartedly, and actively listening. Why don't I extoll him in his
presence with fitting verses?"

Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his
robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward
Sāriputta, and said, "I feel inspired to speak, Reverend
Sāriputta! I feel inspired to speak, Reverend
Sāriputta!"

"Then speak as you feel inspired," said Sāriputta.

Then Vaṅgīsa extolled Sāriputta in his
presence with fitting verses:

> "Deep in wisdom, intelligent,\
> expert in what is the path\
> \>and what is not the path;\
> Sāriputta, so greatly wise,\
> teaches Dhamma to the mendicants.
>
> He teaches in brief,\
> or he speaks at length.\
> His call, like a myna bird,\
> overflows with inspiration.
>
> While he teaches\
> the mendicants listen to his sweet voice,\
> sounding attractive,\
> clear and graceful.\
> They listen joyfully,\
> their hearts elated."

### N 8.7 The Invitation to Admonish *Pavāraṇāsutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the
stilt longhouse of Migāra's mother in the Eastern
Monastery, together with a large Saṅgha of around five
hundred monks, all of whom were perfected ones. Now, at that time it was
the sabbath---the full moon on the fifteenth day---and the Buddha was
sitting in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks for
the invitation to admonish.

Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks, who were
silent. He addressed them: "Come now, monks, I invite you all: Is there
anything I've done by way of body or speech that you would criticize?"

When he had spoken, Venerable Sāriputta got up from his
seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms
toward the Buddha, and said: "There is nothing, sir, that you've done by
way of body or speech that we would criticize. For the Blessed One gave
rise to the unarisen path, gave birth to the unborn path, and explained
the unexplained path. He is the knower of the path, the discoverer of
the path, the expert on the path. And now the disciples live following
the path; they acquire it later. And sir, I invite the Blessed One. Is
there anything I've done by way of body or speech that you would
criticize?"

"There is nothing, Sāriputta, that you've done by way of
body or speech that I would criticize. Sāriputta, you are
astute. You have great wisdom, widespread wisdom, laughing wisdom, swift
wisdom, sharp wisdom, penetrating wisdom. A wheel-turning monarch's
oldest son rightly keeps wielding the power set in motion by his father.
In the same way, Sāriputta rightly keeps rolling the
supreme Wheel of Dhamma that was rolled forth by me."

"Since it seems I have done nothing worthy of the Blessed One's
criticism, is there anything these five hundred monks have done by way
of body or speech that you would criticize?"

"There is nothing, Sāriputta, that these five hundred monks
have done by way of body or speech that I would criticize. For of these
five hundred monks, sixty have the three knowledges, sixty have the six
direct knowledges, sixty are freed both ways, and the rest are freed by
wisdom."

Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his
robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and
said, "I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak,
Holy One!"

"Then speak as you feel inspired," said the Buddha.

Then Vaṅgīsa extolled the Buddha in his presence with
fitting verses:

> "Today, on the fifteenth day sabbath,\
> five hundred monks have gathered together\
> \>to purify their precepts.\
> These untroubled sages\
> \>have cut off their fetters and bonds,\
> they will not be reborn again.
>
> Just as a wheel-turning monarch\
> surrounded by ministers\
> travels all around this\
> land that's girt by sea.
>
> So disciples with the three knowledges,\
> conquerors of death,\
> revere the winner of the battle,\
> the unsurpassed caravan leader.
>
> All are sons of the Blessed One---\
> there is no rubbish here.\
> I bow to the kinsman of the Sun,\
> destroyer of the dart of craving."

### N 8.8 Over a Thousand *Parosahassasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery, together with a large
Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants.

Now at that time the Buddha was educating, encouraging, firing up, and
inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk about extinguishment. And
those mendicants were paying attention, applying the mind, concentrating
wholeheartedly, and actively listening.

Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa thought, "The Buddha is educating,
encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk
about extinguishment. And those mendicants are paying attention,
applying the mind, concentrating wholeheartedly, and actively listening.
Why don't I extoll him in his presence with fitting verses?"

Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his
robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and
said, "I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak,
Holy One!"

"Then speak as you feel inspired," said the Buddha.

Then Vaṅgīsa extolled the Buddha in his presence with
fitting verses:

> "Over a thousand mendicants\
> revere the Holy One\
> as he teaches the immaculate Dhamma,\
> extinguishment, fearing nothing from any quarter.
>
> They listen to the immaculate Dhamma\
> taught by the fully awakened Buddha;\
> the Buddha is so brilliant,\
> at the fore of the mendicant Saṅgha,
>
> Blessed One, your name is 'Giant',\
> seventh of the sages.\
> You are like a great cloud\
> that rains on your disciples.
>
> I've left my day's meditation,\
> out of desire to see the teacher.\
> Great hero, your disciple Vaṅgīsa\
> bows at your feet."

"Vaṅgīsa, had you previously composed these verses, or did
they spring to mind in the moment?"

"They sprang to mind in the moment, sir."

"Well then, Vaṅgīsa, speak some more spontaneously inspired
verses."

"Yes, sir," replied Vaṅgīsa. Then he extolled the Buddha
with some more spontaneously inspired verses, not previously composed:

> "Having overcome Māra's devious path,\
> you wander with hard-heartedness dissolved.\
> See him, the liberator from bonds, unattached,\
> analyzing the teaching.
>
> You have explained in many ways\
> the path to cross the flood.\
> The Seers of Truth stand unfaltering\
> in the freedom from death you've explained.
>
> As the bringer of light who has pierced the truth,\
> you've seen what lies beyond all realms.\
> When you saw and realized this for yourself,\
> you taught it first to the group of five.
>
> When the Dhamma has been so well taught,\
> how could those who know it be negligent?\
> That's why, being diligent, we should always train\
> respectfully in the Buddha's teaching."

### N 8.9 With Koṇḍañña *Koṇḍaññasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the
Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding ground.

Then Venerable Koṇḍañña Who Understood approached the
Buddha after a very long absence. He bowed with his head at the Buddha's
feet, caressing them and covering them with kisses, and pronounced his
name: "I am Koṇḍañña, Blessed One! I am
Koṇḍañña, Holy One!"

Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa thought, "This Venerable
Koṇḍañña Who Understood has approached the Buddha after a
very long absence. He bowed with his head at the Buddha's feet,
caressing them and covering them with kisses, and pronounced his name:
'I am Koṇḍañña, Blessed One! I am Koṇḍañña,
Holy One!' Why don't I extoll him in the Buddha's presence with fitting
verses?"

Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his
robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and
said, "I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak,
Holy One!"

"Then speak as you feel inspired," said the Buddha.

Then Vaṅgīsa extolled Koṇḍañña in the Buddha's
presence with fitting verses:

> "The senior monk who was awakened\
> \>right after the Buddha,\
> Koṇḍañña, is keenly energetic.\
> He regularly gains blissful meditative states,\
> and the three kinds of seclusion.
>
> Whatever can be attained by a disciple\
> who does the Teacher's bidding,\
> he has attained it all,\
> through diligently training himself.
>
> With great power and the three knowledges,\
> expert in comprehending the minds of others,\
> Koṇḍañña, the heir to the Buddha,\
> bows at the Teacher's feet."

### N 8.10 With Moggallāna *Moggallānasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying on the slopes of Isigili at the Black
Rock, together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred
mendicants, all of whom were perfected ones. Thereupon, with his mind,
Venerable Mahāmoggallāna checked to see whose mind was
liberated and free of attachments.

Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa thought, "The Buddha is staying on
the slopes of Isigili ... with five hundred perfected ones.
Mahāmoggallāna is checking to see whose mind is liberated
and free of attachments. Why don't I extoll him in the Buddha's presence
with fitting verses?"

Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his
robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and
said, "I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak,
Holy One!"

"Then speak as you feel inspired," said the Buddha.

Then Vaṅgīsa extolled Mahāmoggallāna in his
presence with fitting verses:

> "As the sage, who has gone beyond suffering,\
> sits upon the mountain slope,\
> he is revered by disciples with the three knowledges,\
> conquerors of death.
>
> Moggallāna, of great psychic power,\
> comprehends with his mind,\
> scrutinizing their minds,\
> liberated, free of attachments.
>
> So they revere Gotama,\
> the sage gone beyond suffering,\
> who is endowed with all path factors,\
> and with a multitude of attributes."

### N 8.11 At Gaggarā *Gaggarāsutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks
of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond, together with a large
Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants, seven hundred male and
seven hundred female lay followers, and many thousands of deities. But
the Buddha outshone them all in beauty and glory.

Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa thought, "The Buddha is staying near
Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond,
together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants,
seven hundred male and seven hundred female lay followers, and many
thousands of deities. And he outshines them all in beauty and glory. Why
don't I extoll him in his presence with fitting verses?"

Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his
robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and
said, "I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak,
Holy One!"

"Then speak as you feel inspired," said the Buddha.

Then Vaṅgīsa extolled the Buddha in his presence with
fitting verses:

> "Like the moon on a cloudless night,\
> like the shining immaculate sun,\
> so too Aṅgīrasa, O great sage,\
> your glory outshines the entire world."

### N 8.12 With Vaṅgīsa *Vaṅgīsasutta*

At one time Venerable Vaṅgīsa was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery.

Now at that time Vaṅgīsa had recently attained perfection.
While experiencing the bliss of freedom, on that occasion he recited
these verses:

> "We used to wander, drunk on poetry,\
> village to village, town to town.\
> Then we saw the Buddha,\
> and faith arose in us.
>
> He taught me Dhamma:\
> the aggregates, sense fields, and elements.\
> When I heard his teaching\
> I went forth to homelessness.
>
> It was truly for the benefit of many\
> that the sage achieved awakening---\
> for the monks and for the nuns\
> who see that they've reached certainty.
>
> It was so welcome for me\
> to be in the presence of the Buddha.\
> I've attained the three knowledges,\
> and fulfilled the Buddha's instructions.
>
> I know my past lives,\
> my clairvoyance is purified,\
> I am master of three knowledges,\
> \>attained in psychic power,\
> expert in comprehending the minds of others."



# Linked Discourses in the Woods

## The Chapter on In the Woods

### N 9.1 Seclusion *Vivekasutta*

So I have heard. At one time one of the mendicants was
staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove.

Now at that time that mendicant, during their day's meditation, was
thinking bad, unskillful thoughts to do with the domestic life. The
deity haunting that forest had sympathy for that mendicant, and wanted
what's best for them. So they approached that mendicant wanting to stir
them up, and addressed them in verse:

> "You entered the woods desiring seclusion,\
> yet your mind strays to outward things.\
> As a person, you should dispel the desire for people.\
> Then you'll be happy, free of greed.
>
> Mindful, give up discontent;\
> let us remind you of the way of the good.\
> The dusty abyss is so hard to cross;\
> don't let sensual dust drag you down.
>
> Just as a bird strewn with dirt\
> sheds that clingy dust with a shake;\
> so too, an energetic, mindful mendicant\
> sheds that clingy dust with a shake."

Impelled by that deity, that mendicant was struck with a sense of
urgency.

The deity haunting that forest had sympathy for that mendicant, and
wanted what's best for them. So they approached that mendicant wanting
to stir them up, and addressed them in verse:

> "Get up, mendicant! Why lie down?\
> What's the point in sleeping?\
> How can the afflicted slumber\
> when injured by an arrow strike?
>
> You should amplify the faith\
> that led you to go forth\
> from the home life to homelessness.\
> Don't fall under the sway of slumber."
>
> "Sensual pleasures are impermanent and unstable,\
> but dullards still fall for them.\
> Among those who are bound,\
> \>they're free and unattached:\
> why bother a renunciate?
>
> By removing desire and greed,\
> by going beyond ignorance,\
> that knowledge has been perfectly cleansed:\
> why bother a renunciate?
>
> By breaking ignorance with knowledge,\
> by the ending of defilements,\
> they're sorrowless, unstressed:\
> why bother a renunciate?
>
> Energetic, resolute,\
> always staunchly vigorous,\
> aspiring to extinguishment:\
> why bother a renunciate?"

At one time Venerable Kassapagotta was staying in the land of the
Kosalans in a certain forest grove.

Now at that time Venerable Kassapagotta, having withdrawn for his day's
meditation, tried to advise a tribal hunter. Then the deity haunting
that forest approached Kassapagotta wanting to stir him up, and recited
these verses:

> "A tribal hunter wandering the rugged hills\
> is unintelligent, unthinking.\
> It's a waste of time to advise him;\
> this mendicant strikes me as a dullard.
>
> The tribal hunter listens without understanding,\
> he looks without seeing.\
> Though the teaching is spoken,\
> the fool doesn't get it.
>
> Even if you lit ten lamps\
> and brought them to him, Kassapa,\
> he wouldn't see anything,\
> for he has no eyes to see."

Impelled by that deity, Venerable Kassapagotta was struck with a sense
of urgency.

### N 9.4 Several Mendicants Set Out Wandering *Sambahulasutta*

At one time several mendicants were staying in the land of the Kosalans
in a certain forest grove.

Then after completing the three months of the rainy season residence,
those mendicants set out wandering. Not seeing those mendicants, the
deity haunting that forest cried. And on that occasion they recited this
verse:

> "Seeing so many vacated seats today,\
> it seems to me they must have become dissatisfied.\
> They were so learned, such brilliant speakers!\
> Where have these disciples of Gotama gone?"

When they had spoken, another deity replied with this verse:

> "They've gone to Magadha, they've gone to Kosala,\

and recited these verses:

> "Set your heart there,\
> where you used to live;\
> among the gods of the thirty-three,\
> whose every desire is granted!\
> At the fore of a retinue\
> of divine maidens, you'll shine!"
>
> "Divine maidens are in a sorry state,\
> stuck in substantial reality.\
> And those beings too are in a sorry state,\
> who are attached to divine maidens."
>
> "They don't know pleasure\
> who don't see the Garden of Delight!\
> It's the abode of lordly gods,\
> the glorious host of Thirty!"
>
> "Fool, don't you understand\
> the saying of the perfected ones:\
> all conditions are impermanent,\
> their nature is to rise and fall;\
> having arisen, they cease;\
> their stilling is blissful.
>
> O Penelope, weaver of the web---\

for him. So they approached him wanting to stir him up, and recited
these verses:

a certain forest grove.

Now at that time that monk had become too closely involved in the
affairs of a certain family. The deity haunting that forest had sympathy
for that monk, wanting what's best for him. So, wanting to stir him up,
they manifested in the appearance of the mistress of that family,
approached the monk, and addressed him in verse:

> "On the banks of the rivers and in the guest houses,\
> in hotels and on highways,\
> people come together and gossip:\
> what's going on between you and me?"
>
> "There are lots of annoying sounds\
> that an austere ascetic must endure.\
> But they mustn't be dismayed by that,\
> for that's not what defiles you.
>
> If you're startled by every little sound,\

### N 9.9 A Vajji *Vajjiputtasutta*

musical instruments being beaten and played, on that occasion recited
this verse:

> like a cast-off log in the forest.\
> On a night like this,\
> who's worse off than me?"

The deity haunting that forest had sympathy for that mendicant, and
wanted what's best for them. So they approached that mendicant wanting
to stir them up, and addressed them in verse:

> "You dwell alone in the wilderness,\
> like a cast-off log in the forest.\
> Lots of people are jealous of you,\
> like beings in hell of those going to heaven."

Impelled by that deity, that mendicant was struck with a sense of
urgency.

### N 9.10 Recitation *Sajjhāyasutta*

At one time one of the mendicants was staying in the land of the
Kosalans in a certain forest grove.

Now at that time that mendicant had previously been spending too much
time in recitation. But some time later they adhered to passivity and
silence. Not hearing the teaching, the deity haunting that forest
approached that mendicant, and addressed them in verse:

> "Mendicant, why don't you recite\
> \>passages of the teaching,\
> living together with other mendicants?\
> When you hear the teaching confidence grows;\
> and the reciter is praised in this very life."
>
> "I used to be enthusiastic about\

> so long as I'd not realized dispassion.\
> But then I realized dispassion, which the good call\
> the laying to rest by completely understanding\
> whatever is seen, heard, and thought."

### N 9.11 Unskillful Thoughts *Akusalavitakkasutta*

At one time one of the mendicants was staying in the land of the
Kosalans in a certain forest grove.

thinking bad, unskillful thoughts, that is: sensual, malicious, and
cruel thoughts. The deity haunting that forest had sympathy for that
mendicant, and wanted what's best for them. So they approached that
mendicant wanting to stir them up, and addressed them in verse:

> make sure your thoughts are rational.
>
> Thinking about the Teacher, the teaching,\
> the Saṅgha, and your own ethics,\
> you'll find gladness,\

### N 9.13 Undisciplined Faculties *Pākatindriyasutta*

At one time several mendicants were staying in the Kosalan lands in a
certain forest grove. They were restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous,
loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion,
with straying minds and undisciplined faculties.

The deity haunting that forest had sympathy for those mendicants, and
wanted what's best for them. So they approached those mendicants wanting
to stir them up, and addressed them in verse:

> "The mendicants used to live happily,\
> as disciples of Gotama.\
> Desireless they sought alms;\
> desireless they used their lodgings.\
> Knowing that the world was impermanent\
> they made an end of suffering.
>
> But now they've made themselves hard to look after,\
> like chiefs in a village.\
> They eat and eat and then lie down,\
> unconscious in the homes of others.
>
> Having raised my joined palms to the Saṅgha,\
> I speak here only about certain people.\
> They're rejects, with no protector,\
> just like those who have passed away.
>
> I'm speaking about\
> those who live negligently.\
> To those who live diligently\
> I pay homage."

Impelled by that deity, those mendicants were struck with a sense of
urgency.

At one time one of the mendicants was staying in the land of the
Kosalans in a certain forest grove.

best for them. So they approached that mendicant wanting to stir them
up, and addressed them in verse:

> "This water flower has not been given.\
> When you sniff it,\
> this is one factor of theft.\
> Good fellow, you are a thief of scent!"
>
> "I do not take, nor do I break;\
> I sniff the water flower from afar.\
> So based on what evidence\
> do you call me a thief of scent?
>
> Why don't you accuse someone\
> who does such vandalizing\
> as digging up the roots,\
> or breaking off the flowers?"
>
> "I have nothing to say\
> to a person who is a crude vandal,\
> soiled like a used nappy.\
> You're the one who deserves to be spoken to.
>
> To the man who has not a blemish\
> who is always seeking purity,\

# Linked Discourses with Spirits

## The Chapter with Indaka

### N 10.1 With Indaka *Indakasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha on Mount Indra's Peak, the haunt of the native
spirit Indaka.

Then the native spirit Indaka went up to the Buddha, and addressed him
in verse:

> "The Buddhas say that form is not the soul.\
> Then how does this body manifest?\
> Where do the bones and liver come from?\
> And how does one cling on in the womb?"
>
> "First there's a drop of coagulate;\
> from there a little bud appears;\
> next it becomes a piece of flesh;\
> which produces a swelling.\
> From that swelling the limbs appear,\
> the head hair, body hair, and nails.
>
> And whatever the mother eats---\
> the food and drink that she consumes---\
> nourishes them there,\
> the person in the mother's womb."

### N 10.2 With a Spirit Named Sakka *Sakkanāmasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the
Vulture's Peak Mountain.

Then a spirit named Sakka went up to the Buddha, and addressed him in
verse:

> "You've given up all ties,\
> and are fully freed.\
> It's not a good idea for you, ascetic,\
> to be instructing others."
>
> "No matter what the apparent reason\
> why people are together, Sakka,\
> it's unworthy for a wise person\
> to not think of the other with sympathy.
>
> If you instruct others\
> with a mind clear and confident,\
> your compassion and empathy\
> don't create attachments."

### N 10.3 With Spiky *Sūcilomasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Gayā on the
cut-stone ledge in the haunt of Spiky the native spirit.

Now at that time the native spirits Shaggy and Spiky were passing by not
far from the Buddha.

So Shaggy said to Spiky, "That's an ascetic."

"That's no ascetic, he's a faker! I'll soon find out whether he's an
ascetic or a faker."

Then Spiky went up to the Buddha and leaned up against his body, but the
Buddha pulled away.

Then Spiky said to the Buddha, "Are you afraid, ascetic?"

"No, good sir, I'm not afraid. But your touch is nasty."

"I will ask you a question, ascetic. If you don't answer me, I'll drive
you insane, or explode your heart, or grab you by the feet and throw you
to the far shore of the Ganges!"

"I don't see anyone in this world with its gods, Māras, and
Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and
humans who could do that to me. But anyway, ask what you wish."

> "Where do greed and hate come from?\
> From where spring discontent, desire, and terror?\
> Where do the mind's thoughts originate,\
> like a crow let loose by boys."
>
> "Greed and hate come from here;\
> from here spring discontent, desire, and terror;\
> here's where the mind's thoughts originate,\
> like a crow let loose by boys.
>
> Born of affection, originating in oneself,\
> like the shoots from a banyan's trunk;\
> the many kinds of attachment to sensual pleasures\
> are like camel's foot creeper\
> \>creeping through the woods.
>
> Those who understand where they come from\
> get rid of them---listen up, spirit!\
> They cross this flood so hard to cross,\
> not crossed before, so as to not be reborn."

### N 10.4 With Maṇibhadda *Maṇibhaddasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans at the
Maṇimālika Tree-shrine, the haunt of the native spirit
Maṇibhadda.

Then the native spirit Maṇibhadda went up to the Buddha,
and recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "It's always auspicious for the mindful;\
> the mindful prosper in happiness.\
> Each new day is better for the mindful,\
> and they're freed from enmity."
>
> "It's always auspicious for the mindful;\
> the mindful prosper in happiness.\
> Each new day is better for the mindful,\
> but they're not freed from enmity.
>
> But someone whose mind delights in harmlessness,\
> all day and all night,\
> with love for all living creatures---\
> they have no enmity for anyone."

### N 10.5 With Sānu *Sānusutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

Now at that time a certain lay woman had a son named Sānu
who had been possessed by a native spirit. And as that lay woman wept,
on that occasion she recited these verses:

> "I have heard this from the perfected ones.\
> The native spirits will not mess with anyone\
> who leads the spiritual life\
> by observing the sabbath
>
> complete in all eight factors\
> on the fourteenth and the fifteenth days,\
> and the eighth day of the fortnight,\
> as well as on the fortnight of special displays.\
> But now today I see\
> native spirits messing with Sānu."
>
> "What you heard from the perfected ones is right.\
> The native spirits will not mess with anyone\
> who leads the spiritual life\
> by observing the sabbath
>
> complete in all eight factors\
> on the fourteenth and the fifteenth days,\
> and the eighth day of the fortnight,\
> as well as on the fortnight of special displays.
>
> When Sānu regains consciousness tell him\
> this saying of the native spirits:\
> Don't do bad deeds\
> either openly or in secret.
>
> If you should do a bad deed,\
> or you're doing one now,\
> you won't be freed from suffering,\
> though you fly away and flee."
>
> "Mum, they cry for the dead,\
> or for one who's alive but has disappeared.\
> I'm alive and you can see me,\
> so mum, why do you weep for me?"
>
> "Son, they cry for the dead,\
> or for one who's alive but has disappeared.\
> But someone who has given up sensual pleasures\
> only to come back here again:\
> they cry for them as well,\
> for though still alive they're really dead.
>
> My dear, you've been rescued from hot coals,\
> and you want to plunge right back in them!\
> My dear, you've been rescued from the abyss,\
> and you want to plunge right back there!
>
> Keep pushing forward, it's what's best for you!\
> Who have I got to complain to?\
> When your things have been saved from a fire,\
> would you want them to be burnt again?"

### N 10.6 With Piyaṅkara *Piyaṅkarasutta*

At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery.

Now at that time Venerable Anuruddha rose at the crack of dawn and
recited passages of the teaching. Then the native spirit
Piyaṅkara's Mother soothed her little child, saying:

> "Don't make a sound, Piyaṅkara!\
> A mendicant recites passages of the teaching.\
> When we understand a passage,\
> we can practice for our welfare.
>
> Let us restrain ourselves from harming living creatures,\
> and speak no lying words.\
> We should train ourselves well in ethics,\
> and hopefully we'll be freed from the goblin realm."

### N 10.7 With Punabbasu *Punabbasusutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

Now at that time the Buddha was educating, encouraging, firing up, and
inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk about extinguishment. And
those mendicants were paying attention, applying the mind, concentrating
wholeheartedly, and actively listening.

Then the native spirit Punabbasu's Mother soothed her little children,
saying:

> "Hush, little Uttarā!\
> Hush, Punabbasu!\
> For I want to listen to the teaching\
> of the Teacher, the supreme Buddha.
>
> Since the Blessed One spoke of extinguishment,\
> the release from all ties,\
> I have a lasting love\
> for this teaching.
>
> In this world, your own child is dear;\
> in this world, your own husband is dear;\
> but even greater than that is my love\
> for this teaching's quest.
>
> For neither son nor husband,\
> dear as they are, can free you from suffering;\
> as listening to the true teaching\
> frees living creatures from suffering.
>
> In this world mired in suffering,\
> fettered by old age and death,\
> I want to listen to the teaching\
> that the Buddha awakened to,\
> which frees you from old age and death.\
> So hush, Punabbasu!"
>
> "Mom, I'm not speaking,\
> and Uttarā is silent, too.\
> Focus just on the teaching,\
> for it's nice to listen to the true teaching.\
> And it's because we haven't understood the teaching\
> that we live in suffering, Mom.
>
> He is a beacon for those who are lost\
> among gods and humans.\
> The Buddha, bearing his final body,\
> the Clear-eyed One teaches Dhamma."
>
> "It's good that my child's so astute,\
> this child I bore and suckled!\
> My child loves the pure teaching\
> of the supreme Buddha.
>
> Punabbasu, may you be happy!\
> Today, I rise.\
> Hear me too, Uttarā:\
> I have seen the noble truths!"

### N 10.8 With Sudatta *Sudattasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the
Cool Grove.

Now at that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika had arrived
at Rājagaha on some business. He heard a rumor that a
Buddha had arisen in the world.

Right away he wanted to go and see the Buddha, but he thought, "It's too
late to go and see the Buddha today. I'll go and see him tomorrow." He
went to bed thinking of the Buddha.

During the night he got up three times thinking it was morning. Then he
approached the Sivaka Gate, and non-human beings opened it for him.

But as he was leaving the city, light vanished and darkness appeared to
him. He felt fear, terror, and goosebumps, and wanted to turn back.

Then the vanished spirit Sivaka called out:

> "A hundred elephants, a hundred horses,\
> a hundred mule-drawn chariots,\
> a hundred thousand maidens\
> bedecked with jeweled earrings:\
> these are not worth a sixteenth part\
> of a single forward stride!
>
> Forward, householder!\
> Forward, householder!\
> Going forward is better for you,\
> not turning back!"

Then darkness vanished and light appeared to Anāthapiṇḍika.
His fear, terror, and goosebumps settled down.

But for a second time, light vanished and darkness appeared to him. ...

For a second time the vanished spirit Sivaka called out ...

> "... Going forward is better for you,\
> not turning back!"

Then darkness vanished and light appeared to Anāthapiṇḍika.
His fear, terror, and goosebumps settled down.

But for a third time, light vanished and darkness appeared to him. ...

For a third time the vanished spirit Sivaka called out ...

> "... Going forward is better for you,\
> not turning back!"

Then darkness vanished and light appeared to Anāthapiṇḍika.
His fear, terror, and goosebumps settled down. Then the householder
Anāthapiṇḍika went to the Cool Grove and approached the
Buddha.

Now at that time the Buddha had risen at the crack of dawn and was
walking mindfully in the open. He saw Anāthapiṇḍika coming
off in the distance. So he stepped down from the walking path, sat down
on the seat spread out, and said to Anāthapiṇḍika, "Come,
Sudatta."

Then Anāthapiṇḍika thought, "The Buddha calls me by name!"
Smiling and elated, he bowed with his head at the Buddha's feet and said
to him, "Sir, I trust the Buddha slept well?"

> "A brahmin who is fully quenched\
> always sleeps at ease.\
> Sensual pleasures slip off them,\
> they're cooled, free of attachments.
>
> Since they've cut off all clinging,\
> and removed the stress from the heart,\
> the peaceful sleep at ease,\
> having found peace of mind."

### N 10.9 With the Nun Sukkā (1st) *Paṭhamasukkāsutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the
Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding ground.

Now, at that time the nun Sukkā was teaching Dhamma,
surrounded by a large assembly. Then a native spirit was so devoted to
Sukkā that he went from street to street and from square to
square, and on that occasion recited these verses:

> "What's up with these people in Rājagaha?\
> They sleep like they've been drinking mead!\
> They don't attend on Sukkā\
> as she's teaching the state free of death.
>
> But the wise---\
> it's as if they drink it up,\
> so irresistible, delicious, and nutritious,\
> like travelers enjoying a cool cloud."

### N 10.10 With the Nun Sukkā (2nd) *Dutiyasukkāsutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the
Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding ground.

Now at that time a certain lay follower gave food to the nun
Sukkā. Then a native spirit was so devoted to
Sukkā that he went from street to street and from square to
square, and on that occasion recited these verses:

> "O! He has made so much merit!\
> That lay follower is so very wise.\
> He just gave food to Sukkā,\
> who is released from all ties."

### N 10.11 With the Nun Cīrā *Cīrāsutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding
ground.

Now at that time a certain lay follower gave a robe to the nun
Cīrā. Then a native spirit was so devoted to
Cīrā that he went from street to street and from square to
square, and on that occasion recited these verses:

> "O! He has made so much merit!\
> That lay-follower is so very wise.\
> He gave a robe to Cīrā,\
> who is released from all yokes."

### N 10.12 With Āḷavaka *Āḷavakasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Āḷavī in the haunt of the native spirit
Āḷavaka.

Then the native spirit Āḷavaka went up to the Buddha, and
said to him: "Get out, ascetic!"

Saying, "All right, good sir," the Buddha went out.

"Get in, ascetic!"

Saying, "All right, good sir," the Buddha went in.

And for a second time the native spirit Āḷavaka said to the
Buddha, "Get out, ascetic!"

Saying, "All right, good sir," the Buddha went out.

"Get in, ascetic!"

Saying, "All right, good sir," the Buddha went in.

And for a third time the native spirit Āḷavaka said to the
Buddha, "Get out, ascetic!"

Saying, "All right, good sir," the Buddha went out.

"Get in, ascetic!"

Saying, "All right, good sir," the Buddha went in.

And for a fourth time the native spirit Āḷavaka said to the
Buddha,

"Get out, ascetic!"

"No, good sir, I won't get out. Do what you must."

"I will ask you a question, ascetic. If you don't answer me, I'll drive
you insane, or explode your heart, or grab you by the feet and throw you
to the far shore of the Ganges!"

"I don't see anyone in this world with its gods, Māras, and
Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and
humans who could do that to me. But anyway, ask what you wish."

> "What's a person's best wealth?\
> What brings happiness when practiced well?\
> What's the sweetest taste of all?\
> The one they say has the best life: how do they live?"
>
> "Faith here is a person's best wealth.\
> The teaching brings happiness when practiced well.\
> Truth is the sweetest taste of all.\
> The one they say has the best life lives by wisdom."
>
> "How do you cross the flood?\
> How do you cross the deluge?\
> How do you get over suffering?\
> How do you get purified?"
>
> "By faith you cross the flood,\
> and by diligence the deluge.\
> By energy you get past suffering,\
> and you're purified by wisdom."
>
> "How do you get wisdom?\
> How do you earn wealth?\
> How do you get a good reputation?\
> How do you hold on to friends?\
> How do the departed not grieve\
> when passing from this world to the next?"
>
> "One who is diligent and discerning\
> gains wisdom by wanting to learn,\
> having faith in the perfected ones,\
> and the teaching for becoming extinguished.
>
> Being responsible, acting appropriately,\
> and working hard you earn wealth.\
> Truthfulness wins you a good reputation.\
> You hold on to friends by giving.\
> That's how the departed do not grieve\
> when passing from this world to the next.
>
> A faithful householder\
> who has these four qualities\
> does not grieve after passing away:\
> truth, principle, steadfastness, and generosity.
>
> Go ahead, ask others as well,\
> there are many ascetics and brahmins.\
> See whether anything better is found\
> than truth, self-control, generosity, and patience."
>
> "Why now would I question\
> the many ascetics and brahmins?\
> Today I understand\
> what's good for the next life.
>
> It was truly for my benefit\
> that the Buddha came to stay at Āḷavī.\
> Today I understand\
> where a gift is very fruitful.
>
> I myself will journey\
> village to village, town to town,\
> paying homage to the Buddha,\
> and the natural excellence of the teaching!"



# Linked Discourses with Sakka

## Chapter One

### N 11.1 With Suvīra *Suvīrasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Once upon a time, mendicants, the titans marched against the gods.

Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the god Suvīra, 'Dear
Suvīra, the titans march against the gods! Go, and march
against the titans!'

'Yes, lord,' replied Suvīra. But he fell into negligence.

For a second time Sakka addressed Suvīra, 'Dear
Suvīra, the titans march against the gods! Go, and march
against the titans!'

'Yes, lord,' replied Suvīra. But for a second time he fell
into negligence.

For a third time Sakka addressed Suvīra, 'Dear
Suvīra, the titans march against the gods! Go, and march
against the titans!'

'Yes, lord,' replied Suvīra. But for a third time he fell
into negligence.

Then Sakka addressed the god Suvīra in verse:

> 'Suvīra, go to that place\
> where you can achieve happiness\
> without working for it or trying hard---\
> and take me with you!'
>
> 'That a lazy man who does no work,\
> and doesn't do his duty,\
> should fulfill all his desires:\
> Sakka, grant me this boon!'
>
> 'Suvīra, go to that place\
> where a lazy man who does no work\
> prospers in unending happiness---\
> and take me with you!'
>
> 'O Sakka, first among gods,\
> that we might find the happiness\
> that's sorrowless, unstressed:\
> Sakka, grant me this boon!'
>
> 'If there exists anywhere a place\
> where one can live happily without working,\
> that surely would be extinguishment's path!\
> Go there, Suvīra,\
> and take me with you!'

So, mendicants, even Sakka, lord of gods---while living off of the fruit
of his good and bad deeds, and ruling as sovereign lord over these gods
of the thirty-three---will speak in praise of initiative and energy. But
since you have gone forth in such a well explained teaching and
training, it would be truly beautiful for you to try hard, strive, and
make an effort to attain the unattained, achieve the unachieved, and
realize the unrealized!"

### N 11.2 With Susīma *Susīmasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Once upon a time, mendicants, the titans marched against the gods.

Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the god Susīma, 'Dear
Susīma, the titans march against the gods! Go, and march
against the titans!'

'Yes, lord,' replied Susīma. But he fell into negligence.

For a second time ...

For a third time ...

Then Sakka addressed the god Susīma in verse:

> 'Susīma, go to that place\
> where you can achieve happiness\
> without working for it or trying hard---\
> and take me with you!'
>
> 'That a lazy man who does no work,\
> and doesn't do his duty,\
> should fulfill all his desires:\
> Sakka, grant me this boon!'
>
> 'Susīma, go to that place\
> where a lazy man who does no work\
> prospers in unending happiness---\
> and take me with you!'
>
> 'O Sakka, first among gods,\
> that we might find the happiness\
> that's sorrowless, unstressed:\
> Sakka, grant me this boon!'
>
> 'If there exists anywhere a place\
> where one can live happily without working,\
> that surely would be extinguishment's path!\
> Susīma, go to that place\
> and take me with you!'

So, mendicants, even Sakka, lord of gods---while living off of the fruit
of his good and bad deeds, and ruling as sovereign lord over these gods
of the thirty-three---will speak in praise of initiative and energy. But
since you have gone forth in such a well explained teaching and
training, it would be truly beautiful for you to try hard, strive, and
make an effort to attain the unattained, achieve the unachieved, and
realize the unrealized!"

### N 11.3 The Banner's Crest *Dhajaggasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Once upon a time, mendicants, a battle was fought between the gods and
the titans. Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the
thirty-three:

'Good fellows, when the gods are fighting, if you get scared or
terrified, just look up at my banner's crest. Then your fear and terror
will go away.

If you can't see my banner's crest, then look up at the banner's crest
of the Progenitor, king of gods. Then your fear and terror will go away.

If you can't see his banner's crest, then look up at the banner's crest
of Varuṇa, king of gods. Then your fear and terror will go
away.

If you can't see his banner's crest, then look up at the banner's crest
of Īsāna, king of gods. Then your fear and terror will go
away.'

However, when they look up at those banner's crests their fear and
terror might go away or it might not.

Why is that? Because Sakka is not free of greed, hate, and delusion. He
is fearful, scared, nervous, quick to flee.

But, mendicants, I say this: If you've gone to a wilderness, or to the
root of a tree, or to an empty hut and you get scared or terrified, just
recollect me: 'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha,
accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world,
supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans,
awakened, blessed.' Then your fear and terror will go away.

If you can't recollect me, then recollect the teaching: 'The teaching is
well explained by the Buddha---apparent in the present life, immediately
effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can
know it for themselves.' Then your fear and terror will go away.

If you can't recollect the teaching, then recollect the
Saṅgha: 'The Saṅgha of the Buddha's disciples
is practicing the way that's good, sincere, systematic, and proper. It
consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the
Saṅgha of the Buddha's disciples that is worthy of
offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a
religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the
supreme field of merit for the world.' Then your fear and terror will go
away.

Why is that? Because the Realized One is free of greed, hate, and
delusion. He is fearless, brave, bold, and stands his ground."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "In the wilderness, at a tree's root,\
> or an empty hut, O mendicants,\
> recollect the Buddha,\
> and no fear will come to you.
>
> If you can't recollect the Buddha---\
> the eldest in the world, the chief of men---\
> then recollect the teaching,\
> emancipating, well taught.
>
> If you can't recollect the teaching---\
> emancipating, well taught---\
> then recollect the Saṅgha,\
> the supreme field of merit.
>
> Thus recollecting the Buddha,\
> the teaching, and the Saṅgha, mendicants,\
> fear and terror\
> and goosebumps will be no more."

### N 11.4 With Vepacitti *Vepacittisutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Once upon a time, mendicants, a battle was fought between the gods and
the titans.

Then Vepacitti, lord of titans, addressed the titans, 'My good fellows,
if the titans defeat the gods in this battle, bind Sakka, the lord of
gods, by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the citadel
of the titans.'

Meanwhile, Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the thirty-three,
'My good fellows, if the gods defeat the titans in this battle, bind
Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the Hall
of Justice of the gods.'

In that battle the gods won and the titans lost. So the gods of the
thirty-three bound Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and brought him to
Sakka's presence in the Hall of Justice of the gods.

And as Sakka was entering and leaving the hall, Vepacitti abused and
insulted him with rude, harsh words. So Mātali the
charioteer addressed Sakka in verse,

> 'O Maghavā, O Sakka,\
> is it from fear or from weakness\
> that you put up with such harsh words\
> in the presence of Vepacitti?'
>
> 'It's not out of fear or weakness\
> that I'm patient with Vepacitti.\
> For how can a sensible person like me\
> get in a fight with a fool?'
>
> 'Fools would vent even more\
> if there's no-one to put a stop to them.\
> So a wise one should stop\
> a fool with forceful punishment.'
>
> 'I think that this is the only way\
> to put a stop to a fool,\
> when you know that the other is upset,\
> be mindful and stay calm.'
>
> 'I see this fault, Vāsava,\
> in just being patient.\
> When a fool thinks,\
> "He puts up with me out of fear,"\
> the simpleton will go after you even harder,\
> like a cow chasing someone who runs away.'
>
> 'Let him think this if he wishes, or not---\
> "He puts up with me out of fear."\
> Of goals culminating in one's own good,\
> none better than patience is found.
>
> When a strong person\
> puts up with a weakling,\
> they call that the ultimate patience,\
> for a weakling must always be patient.
>
> The strength of folly\
> is really just weakness, they say.\
> But no-one can challenge a person\
> who's strong, guarded by the teaching.
>
> When you get angry at an angry person\
> you just make things worse for yourself.\
> When you don't get angry at an angry person\
> you win a battle hard to win.
>
> When you know that the other is angry,\
> you act for the good of both\
> yourself and the other\
> if you're mindful and stay calm.
>
> People unfamiliar with the teaching\
> consider one who heals both\
> oneself and the other\
> to be a fool.'

So, mendicants, even Sakka, lord of gods---while living off of the fruit
of his good and bad deeds, and ruling as sovereign lord over these gods
of the thirty-three---will speak in praise of patience and sweetness.
But since you have gone forth in such a well explained teaching and
training, it would be truly beautiful for you to be patient and gentle!"

### N 11.5 Victory by Good Speech *Subhāsitajayasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Once upon a time, mendicants, a battle was fought between the gods and
the titans.

Then Vepacitti, lord of titans, said to Sakka, lord of gods, 'Lord of
gods, let there be victory by fine words!'

'Vepacitti, let there be victory by fine words!'

Then the gods and the titans appointed a panel of judges, saying, 'These
will understand our good and bad statements.'

Then Vepacitti, lord of titans, said to Sakka, lord of gods, 'Lord of
gods, recite a verse!'

When he said this, Sakka said to him, 'Vepacitti, you are the elder god
here. Recite a verse.'

So Vepacitti recited this verse:

> 'Fools would vent even more\
> if there's no-one to put a stop to them.\
> So an intelligent person should stop\
> a fool with forceful punishment.'

The titans applauded Vepacitti's verse, while the gods kept silent.

Then Vepacitti said to Sakka, 'Lord of gods, recite a verse!' So Sakka
recited this verse:

> 'I think that this is the only way\
> to put a stop to a fool,\
> when you know that the other is upset,\
> be mindful and stay calm.'

The gods applauded Sakka's verse, while the titans kept silent.

Then Sakka said to Vepacitti, 'Vepacitti, recite a verse!' So Vepacitti
recited this verse:

> 'I see this fault, Vāsava,\
> in just being patient.\
> When a fool thinks,\
> "He puts up with me out of fear,"\
> the simpleton will go after you even harder,\
> like a cow chasing someone who runs away.'

The titans applauded Vepacitti's verse, while the gods kept silent.

Then Vepacitti said to Sakka, 'Lord of gods, recite a verse!' So Sakka
recited this verse:

> 'Let him think this if he wishes, or not---\
> "He puts up with me out of fear."\
> Of goals culminating in one's own good,\
> none better than patience is found.
>
> When a strong person\
> puts up with a weakling,\
> they call that the ultimate patience,\
> for a weakling must always be patient.
>
> The strength of folly\
> is really just weakness, they say.\
> But no-one can challenge a person\
> who's strong, guarded by the teaching.
>
> When you get angry at an angry person\
> you just make things worse for yourself.\
> When you don't get angry at an angry person\
> you win a battle hard to win.
>
> When you know that the other is angry,\
> you act for the good of both\
> yourself and the other\
> if you're mindful and stay calm.
>
> People unfamiliar with the teaching\
> consider one who heals both\
> oneself and the other\
> to be a fool.'

The gods applauded Sakka's verses, while the titans kept silent.

Then the panel of judges consisting of both gods and titans said this,
'The verses spoken by Vepacitti evoke punishment and violence. That's
how you get arguments, quarrels, and disputes. The verses spoken by
Sakka don't evoke punishment and violence. That's how you stay free of
arguments, quarrels, and disputes.

Sakka, lord of gods, wins victory by fine words!'

And that's how Sakka came to win victory by fine words."

### N 11.6 Bird Nests *Kulāvakasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Once upon a time, mendicants, a battle was fought between the gods and
the titans. In that battle the titans won and the gods lost. Defeated,
the gods fled north with the titans in pursuit.

Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed his charioteer Mātali
in verse:

> 'Mātali, don't ram the bird nests\
> in the red silk-cotton woods with your chariot pole.\
> I'd rather give up our lives to the titans\
> than deprive these birds of their nests.'

'Yes, lord,' replied Mātali. And he turned the chariot back
around, with its team of a thousand thoroughbreds.

Then the titans thought, 'Now Sakka's chariot has turned back. The
titans will have to fight the gods a second time!' Terrified, they
retreated right away to the citadel of the titans.

And that's how Sakka came to win victory by principle."

### N 11.7 Not Betray *Nadubbhiyasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Once upon a time, mendicants, as Sakka, lord of gods, was in private
retreat this thought came to his mind, 'I should never betray even a
sworn enemy.'

And then Vepacitti, lord of titans, knowing Sakka's train of thought,
approached him.

Sakka saw Vepacitti coming off in the distance, and said to him, 'Stop,
Vepacitti, you're caught!'

'Dear sir, don't give up the idea you just had!'

'Swear, Vepacitti, that you won't betray me.'

> 'Whatever bad things happen to a liar,\
> or to someone who slanders the noble ones,\
> or to someone who betrays a friend,\
> or to someone who's ungrateful,\
> the same bad things impact\
> anyone who betrays you, Sujā's husband.'"

### N 11.8 Verocana, Lord of Titans *Verocanaasurindasutta*

Near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove.

Now at that time the Buddha had gone into retreat for the day's
meditation.

Then Sakka, lord of gods, and Verocana, lord of titans, approached the
Buddha and stationed themselves one by each door-post. Then Verocana
recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "A man should make an effort\
> until his goal is accomplished.\
> When goals are accomplished they shine:\
> this is the word of Verocana!"
>
> "A man should make an effort\
> until his goal is accomplished.\
> Of goals that shine when accomplished,\
> none better than patience is found."
>
> "All beings are goal-orientated,\
> as befits them in each case.\
> But connection is the ultimate\
> of pleasures for all living creatures.\
> When goals are accomplished they shine:\
> this is the word of Verocana!"
>
> "All beings are goal-orientated,\
> as befits them in each case.\
> But connection is the ultimate\
> of pleasures for all living creatures.\
> Of goals that shine when accomplished,\
> none better than patience is found."

### N 11.9 Seers in the Wilderness *Araññāyatanaisisutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Once upon a time, mendicants, several seers who were ethical, of good
character, settled in leaf huts in a wilderness region.

Then Sakka, lord of gods, and Vepacitti, lord of titans, went to those
seers. Vepacitti put on his boots, strapped on his sword, and, carrying
a sunshade, entered the hermitage through the main gate. He walked right
past those seers, keeping them at a distance.

Sakka took off his boots, gave his sword to others, and, putting down
his sunshade, entered the hermitage through a gate he happened upon. He
stood downwind of those seers, revering them with joined palms.

Then those seers addressed Sakka in verse:

> 'When seers have been long ordained,\
> the odor of their bodies goes with the gale.\
> You'd better leave, O thousand-eyed!\
> The odor of the seers is unclean, king of gods.'
>
> 'When seers have been long ordained,\
> let the odor of their bodies go with the gale.\
> We yearn for this odor, sirs,\
> like a colorful crown of flowers.\
> The gods don't see it as repulsive.'"

### N 11.10 Seers by the Ocean *Samuddakasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Once upon a time, mendicants, several seers who were ethical, of good
character, settled in leaf huts on the ocean shore.

Now at that time a battle was fought between the gods and the titans.

Then the seers thought, 'The gods are principled, the titans are
unprincipled. We may be at risk from the titans. Why don't we approach
Sambara, lord of titans, and beg him for a pledge of safety.'

Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm,
those seers vanished from those leaf huts on the ocean shore and
reappeared in Sambara's presence. Then those seers addressed Sambara in
verse:

> 'The seers have come to Sambara\
> to beg for a pledge of safety.\
> For you can give them what you wish,\
> whether danger or safety.'
>
> 'There is no safety for seers,\
> the hated associates of Sakka!\
> Though you beg me for your safety,\
> I'll only give you fear!'
>
> 'Though we beg you for our safety,\
> you give us only fear.\
> This is what we get from you:\
> may endless peril come to you!
>
> Whatever kind of seed you sow,\
> that is the fruit you reap.\
> A doer of good gets good,\
> a doer of bad gets bad.\
> You have sown your own seed, friend,\
> now you'll experience the fruit.'

Then those seers, having cursed Sambara, as easily as a strong person
would extend or contract their arm, vanished from Sambara's presence and
reappeared in those leaf huts on the ocean shore.

But after being cursed by the seers, Sambara woke in alarm three times
that night."

## Chapter Two

### N 11.11 Vows *Vatapadasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, in a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he
undertook seven vows. And it was because of undertaking these that he
achieved the status of Sakka. What seven?

As long as I live, may I support my parents. As long as I live, may I
honor the elders in the family. As long as I live, may I speak gently.
As long as I live, may I not speak divisively. As long as I live, may I
live at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous,
open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and
to share. As long as I live, may I speak the truth. As long as I live,
may I be free of anger, or should anger arise, may I quickly get rid of
it.

In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he undertook seven vows.
And it was because of undertaking these that he achieved the status of
Sakka.

> A person who respects their parents,\
> and honors the elders in the family,\
> whose speech is gentle and courteous,\
> and has given up divisiveness;
>
> who's committed to getting rid of stinginess,\
> is truthful, and has mastered anger:\
> the gods of the thirty-three\
> say they really are a true person."

### N 11.12 Sakka's Names *Sakkanāmasutta*

Near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove. There the Buddha said to the
mendicants:

"Mendicants, in a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he was a
student named Magha. That's why he's called Maghavā.

In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he was first to give
gifts. That's why he's called Purindada the Firstgiver.

In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he gave gifts ably.
That's why he's called Sakka the Able.

In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he gave the gift of a
guest house. That's why he's called Vāsava the Houser.

Sakka thinks of a thousand things in an hour. That's why he's called
Sahassakkha the Thousand-Eyed.

Sakka's wife is the titan maiden named Sujā. That's why
he's called Sujampati, Sujā's Husband.

Sakka rules as sovereign lord over the gods of the thirty-three. That's
why he's called lord of gods.

In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he undertook seven vows.
And it was because of undertaking these that he achieved the status of
Sakka. What seven?

As long as I live, may I support my parents. As long as I live, may I

it.

### N 11.13 With Mahāli *Mahālisutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked
roof.

Then Mahāli the Licchavi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat
down to one side, and said to him, "Sir, have you seen Sakka, lord of
gods?"

"I have, Mahāli."

"But surely, sir, you must have seen someone who looked like Sakka. For
Sakka is hard to see."

"Mahāli, I understand Sakka. And I understand the things
that he undertook and committed to, which enabled him to achieve the
status of Sakka.

In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he was a student named
Magha. That's why he's called Maghavā.

In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he gave gifts ably.
That's why he's called Sakka the Able.

In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he was first to give
gifts. That's why he's called Purindada the Firstgiver.

In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he gave the gift of a
guest house. That's why he's called Vāsava the Houser.

Sakka thinks of a thousand things in an hour. That's why he's called
Sahassakkha the Thousand-Eyed.

Sakka's wife is the titan maiden named Sujā. That's why
he's called Sujampati, Sujā's Husband.

Sakka rules as sovereign lord over the gods of the thirty-three. That's
why he's called Devānaminda the lord of gods.

In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he undertook seven vows.
And it was because of undertaking these that he achieved the status of
Sakka. What seven?

As long as I live, may I support my parents. As long as I live, may I
honor the elders in the family. As long as I live, may I speak gently.
As long as I live, may I not speak divisively. As long as I live, may I

may I be free of anger, or should anger arise, may I quickly get rid of
it.

### N 11.14 Poor *Daliddasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the
Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding ground. There the Buddha addressed
the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a poor person, destitute and
pitiful. They took up faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom in
the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One. After
undertaking these things, when their body broke up, after death, they
were reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of the
gods of the thirty-three. There they outshone the other gods in beauty
and glory.

But the gods of the thirty-three complained, grumbled, and objected, 'Oh
lord, how incredible, how amazing! For when this god was a human being
in their past life they were poor, destitute, and pitiful. And when
their body broke up, after death, they were reborn in a good place, a
heavenly realm, in the company of the gods of the thirty-three. Here
they outshine the other gods in beauty and glory.'

Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the thirty-three, 'Good
fellows, don't complain about this god. When this god was a human being
in their past life they took up faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and
wisdom in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.
After undertaking these things, when their body broke up, after death,
they've been reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of
the gods of the thirty-three. Here they outshine the other gods in
beauty and glory.'

Then Sakka, lord of gods, guiding the gods of the thirty-three, recited
this verse:

> 'Whoever has faith in the Realized One,\
> unwavering and well grounded;\
> whose ethical conduct is good,\
> praised and loved by the noble ones;
>
> who has confidence in the Saṅgha,\
> and correct view:\
> they're said to be prosperous,\
> their life is not in vain.
>
> So let the wise devote themselves\
> to faith, ethical behaviour,\
> confidence, and insight into the teaching,\
> remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.'"

### N 11.15 Delightful *Rāmaṇeyyakasutta*

Near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove.

And then Sakka, lord of gods, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one
side, and said to him, "Sir, what is a delightful place?"

> "Shrines in parks and forests,\
> well-made lotus ponds,\
> are not worth a sixteenth part\
> of a delightful human being.
>
> Whether in village or wilderness,\
> in a valley or the uplands,\
> wherever the perfected ones live\
> is a delightful place."

### N 11.16 Sponsoring Sacrifice *Yajamānasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the
Vulture's Peak Mountain.

And then Sakka, lord of gods, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one
side, and addressed him in verse:

> "For humans, those merit-seeking creatures,\
> who sponsor sacrifices,\
> making worldly merit,\
> where is a gift very fruitful?"
>
> "Four practicing the path,\
> and four established in the fruit.\
> This is the sincere Saṅgha,\
> with wisdom, ethics, and immersion.
>
> For humans, those merit-seeking creatures,\
> who sponsor sacrifices,\
> making worldly merit,\
> what is given to the Saṅgha is very fruitful."

### N 11.17 Homage to the Buddha *Buddhavandanāsutta*

Near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove.

Now at that time the Buddha had gone into retreat for the day's
meditation. Then Sakka, lord of gods, and the divinity Sahampati
approached the Buddha and stationed themselves one by each door-post.

Then Sakka recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "Rise, hero! Victor in battle, with burden put down,\
> wander the world free of debt.\
> Your mind is fully liberated,\
> like the moon on the fifteenth night."

"Lord of gods, that's not how to pay homage to the Realized Ones. This
is how it should be done:

> 'Rise, hero! Victor in battle, leader of the caravan,\
> wander the world free of debt.\
> Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma!\
> There will be those who understand!'"

### N 11.18 Who Sakka Worships *Gahaṭṭhavandanāsutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Once upon a time, mendicants, Sakka, lord of gods, addressed his
charioteer Mātali, 'My dear Mātali, harness
the chariot with its team of a thousand thoroughbreds. We will go to a
park and see the scenery.'

'Yes, lord,' replied Mātali. He harnessed the chariot and
informed Sakka, 'Good fellow, the chariot with its team of a thousand
thoroughbreds has been harnessed. Please go at your convenience.'

Then Sakka descended from the Palace of Victory, raised his joined
palms, and revered the different quarters.

So Mātali the charioteer addressed Sakka in verse:

> 'Those proficient in the three Vedas worship you,\
> as do all the aristocrats on earth,\
> the four great kings,\
> and the glorious thirty.\
> So what's the name of the spirit\
> that you worship, Sakka?'
>
> 'Those proficient in the three Vedas worship me,\
> as do all the aristocrats on earth,\
> the four great kings,\
> and the glorious thirty.
>
> But I revere those accomplished in ethics,\
> who have long trained in immersion,\
> who have rightly gone forth\
> committed to the spiritual life.
>
> I also worship those householders,\
> the ethical lay followers\
> who make merit, Mātali,\
> providing for a partner in a principled manner.'
>
> 'Those who you worship\
> seem to be the best in the world, Sakka.\
> I too will worship\
> those who you worship, Sakka.'
>
> After saying this, Maghavā the chief,\
> king of gods, Sujā's husband,\
> having worshipped the quarters\
> climbed into his chariot."

### N 11.19 Who Sakka Worships *Satthāravandanāsutta*

Near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove.

"Once upon a time, mendicants, Sakka, lord of gods, addressed his
charioteer Mātali, 'My dear Mātali, harness
the chariot with its team of a thousand thoroughbreds. We will go to a
park and see the scenery.'

'Yes, lord,' replied Mātali. He harnessed the chariot and
informed Sakka, 'Good fellow, the chariot with its team of a thousand
thoroughbreds has been harnessed. Please go at your convenience.'

Then Sakka descended from the Palace of Victory, raised his joined
palms, and revered the Buddha.

So Mātali the charioteer addressed Sakka in verse:

> 'Gods and men\
> worship you, Vāsava.\
> So what's the name of the spirit\
> that you worship, Sakka?'
>
> 'It's the fully awakened Buddha,\
> the Teacher of peerless name\
> in this world with its gods---\
> that's who I worship, Mātali.
>
> Those in whom greed, hate, and ignorance\
> have faded away;\
> the perfected ones with defilements ended---\
> they're who I worship, Mātali.
>
> The trainees who enjoy reducing suffering,\
> diligently pursuing the training\
> for getting rid of greed and hate,\
> and going past ignorance---\
> they're who I worship, Mātali.'
>
> 'Those who you worship\
> seem to be the best in the world, Sakka.\
> I too will worship\
> those who you worship, Sakka.'
>
> After saying this, Maghavā the chief,\
> king of gods, Sujā's husband,\
> having worshipped the Buddha,\
> climbed into his chariot."

### N 11.20 Who Sakka Worships *Saṁghavandanāsutta*

Near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove.

"Once upon a time, mendicants, Sakka, lord of gods, addressed his
charioteer Mātali, 'My dear Mātali, harness
the chariot with its team of a thousand thoroughbreds. We will go to a
park and see the scenery.'

'Yes, lord,' replied Mātali. He harnessed the chariot and
informed Sakka, 'Good fellow, the chariot with its team of a thousand
thoroughbreds has been harnessed. Please go at your convenience.'

Then Sakka descended from the Palace of Victory, raised his joined
palms, and revered the mendicant Saṅgha.

So Mātali the charioteer addressed Sakka in verse:

> 'It's these who should worship you,\
> namely the humans stuck in their putrid bodies,\
> sunk in a carcass,\
> stricken by hunger and thirst.
>
> Why then do you envy those\
> who are homeless, Vāsava?\
> Relate the seers' way of life,\
> let us hear what you say.'
>
> 'This is why I envy the\
> homeless, Mātali.\
> When they leave a village,\
> they proceed without concern.
>
> They hoard no goods in storerooms,\
> nor in pots or baskets.\
> They seek food prepared by others,\
> and, true to their vows, live on that.
>
> The attentive, whose words are full of wisdom,\
> live peacefully and quietly.\
> Gods fight with titans,\
> and mortals fight each other, Mātali.
>
> Not fighting among those who fight,\
> quenched among those who are armed,\
> not grasping among those who grasp:\
> they're who I worship, Mātali.'
>
> 'Those who you worship\
> seem to be the best in the world, Sakka.\
> I too will worship\
> those who you worship, Vāsava.'
>
> After saying this, Maghavā the chief,\
> king of gods, Sujā's husband,\
> having worshipped the mendicant Saṅgha,\
> climbed into his chariot."

## Chapter Three

### N 11.21 Incinerated *Chetvāsutta*

Near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove.

And then Sakka, lord of gods, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one
side, and addressed him in verse:

> "When what is incinerated do you sleep at ease?\
> When what is incinerated is there no sorrow?\
> What is the one thing\
> whose killing you approve?"
>
> "When anger's incinerated you sleep at ease.\
> When anger's incinerated there is no sorrow.\
> O Vāsava, anger has a poisonous root\
> and a honey tip.\
> The noble ones praise its killing,\
> for when it's incinerated there is no sorrow."

### N 11.22 Ugly *Dubbaṇṇiyasutta*

Near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove.

"Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a native spirit who was ugly
and deformed. He sat on the throne of Sakka, lord of gods.

But the gods of the thirty-three complained, grumbled, and objected, 'Oh
lord, how incredible, how amazing! This ugly and deformed spirit is
sitting on the throne of Sakka, the lord of gods.' But the more the gods
complained, the more attractive, good-looking, and lovely that spirit
became.

So the gods went up to Sakka and told him what had happened, adding,
'Surely, good fellow, that must be the anger-eating spirit!'

Then Sakka went up to that spirit, arranged his robe over one shoulder,
knelt with his right knee on the ground, raised his joined palms toward
the anger-eating spirit, and pronounced his name three times: 'Good
fellow, I am Sakka, lord of gods! Good fellow, I am Sakka, the lord of
gods!' But the more Sakka pronounced his name, the uglier and more
deformed the spirit became, until eventually it vanished right there.

Then Sakka, lord of gods, guiding the gods of the thirty-three, recited
this verse:

> 'My mind isn't easily upset;\
> I'm not easily drawn into the maelstrom.\
> I don't get angry for long,\
> anger doesn't last in me.
>
> When I do get angry I don't speak harshly,\
> nor do I advertise my own virtues.\
> I carefully restrain myself\
> out of regard for my own welfare.'"

### N 11.23 The Sambari Sorcery *Sambarimāyāsutta*

At Sāvatthī.

The Buddha said this:

"Once upon a time, mendicants, Vepacitti, lord of titans, was sick,
suffering, gravely ill. So Sakka went to see him to ask after his
illness.

Vepacitti saw Sakka coming off in the distance, and said to him, 'Heal
me, lord of gods!'

'Teach me, Vepacitti, the Sambari sorcery.'

'I can't do that, good fellow, until I have consulted with the titans.'

Then Vepacitti, lord of titans, asked the titans, 'Good fellows, may I
teach the Sambari sorcery to Sakka, lord of gods?'

'Do not, good fellow, teach the Sambari sorcery to Sakka!'

So Vepacitti addressed Sakka in verse:

> 'O Maghavā, O Sakka,\
> king of gods, Sujā's husband,\
> a sorceror falls into the terrible hell---\
> like Sambara, for a hundred years.'"

### N 11.24 Transgression *Accayasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time two mendicants had clashed. One of them transgressed
against the other. The transgressor confessed to the other mendicant,
but they didn't accept it. Then several mendicants went up to the
Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.

"Mendicants, there are two fools. One who doesn't recognize when they've
made a mistake. And one who doesn't properly accept the confession of
someone who's made a mistake. These are the two fools.

There are two who are astute. One who recognizes when they've made a
mistake. And one who properly accepts the confession of someone who's
made a mistake. These are the two who are astute.

Once upon a time, mendicants, Sakka, lord of gods, guiding the gods of
the thirty-three, recited this verse:

> 'Control your anger;\
> don't let friendships decay.\
> Don't blame the blameless,\
> and don't say divisive things.\
> For anger crushes bad people\
> like a mountain.'"

### N 11.25 Don't Be Angry *Akkodhasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery.

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:

"Once upon a time, mendicants, Sakka, lord of gods, guiding the gods of
the thirty-three, recited this verse:

> 'Don't let anger be your master,\
> don't get angry at angry people.\
> Kindness and harmlessness\
> are always present in the noble ones.\
> For anger crushes bad people\
> like a mountain.'"
