# DN 14 The Great Discourse on Traces Left Behind

_**Mahāpadānasutta**_

## 1. On Past Lives

So I have heard.[^1] At one time the Buddha was staying
near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery, in the hut by the kareri tree.[^2]

Then after the meal, on return from almsround, several mendicants sat
together in the pavilion by the kareri tree and this Dhamma talk on the
subject of past lives came up among them, "So it was in a past life;
such it was in a past life."[^3]

With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha heard
that discussion among the mendicants. So he got up from his seat and
went to the pavilion, where he sat on the seat spread out and addressed
the mendicants, "Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just
now? What conversation was left unfinished?"

The mendicants told him what had happened, adding, "This is the
conversation that was unfinished when the Buddha arrived."

"Would you like to hear a Dhamma talk on the subject of past lives?"

"Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! Let the Buddha
give a Dhamma talk on the subject of past lives. The mendicants will
listen and remember it."

"Well then, mendicants, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Ninety-one eons ago, the Buddha Vipassī arose in the
world, perfected and fully awakened.[^4] Thirty-one eons ago, the Buddha
Sikhī arose in the world, perfected and fully awakened.[^5]
In the same thirty-first eon, the Buddha Vessabhū arose in
the world, perfected and fully awakened.[^6] In the present fortunate
eon, the Buddhas Kakusandha,[^7] Koṇāgamana,[^8] and
Kassapa arose in the world, perfected and fully awakened.[^9] And in the
present fortunate eon, I have arisen in the world, perfected and fully
awakened.[^10]

The Buddhas Vipassī, Sikhī, and
Vessabhū were born as aristocrats into aristocrat families.
The Buddhas Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana, and Kassapa were born
as brahmins into brahmin families. I was born as an aristocrat into an
aristocrat family.[^11]

Koṇḍañña was the clan of Vipassī,[^12]
Sikhī, and Vessabhū. Kassapa was the clan of
Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana, and Kassapa. Gotama is my
clan.[^13]

For Vipassī, the lifespan was 80,000 years. For
Sikhī, the lifespan was 70,000 years. For
Vessabhū, the lifespan was 60,000 years. For Kakusandha,
the lifespan was 40,000 years. For Koṇāgamana, the lifespan
was 30,000 years. For Kassapa, the lifespan was 20,000 years. For me at
this time the lifespan is short, brief, and fleeting. A long-lived
person lives for a century or a little more.

Vipassī was awakened at the root of a patala tree.[^14]
Sikhī was awakened at the root of a white-mango tree.[^15]
Vessabhū was awakened at the root of a sal tree.[^16]
Kakusandha was awakened at the root of a sirisa tree.[^17]
Koṇāgamana was awakened at the root of a cluster fig
tree.[^18] Kassapa was awakened at the root of a banyan tree.[^19] I was
awakened at the root of a peepal tree.[^20]

Vipassī had a fine pair of chief disciples named
Khaṇḍa and Tissa. Sikhī had a fine pair of
chief disciples named Abhibhū and Sambhava.
Vessabhū had a fine pair of chief disciples named
Soṇa and Uttara. Kakusandha had a fine pair of chief
disciples named Vidhura and Sañjīva.
Koṇāgamana had a fine pair of chief disciples named
Bhiyyosa and Uttara. Kassapa had a fine pair of chief disciples named
Tissa and Bhāradvāja. I have a fine pair of chief disciples
named Sāriputta and Moggallāna.

Vipassī had three gatherings of disciples---one of
6,800,000, one of 100,000, and one of 80,000---all of them mendicants
who had ended their defilements.[^21]

Sikhī had three gatherings of disciples---one of 100,000,
one of 80,000, and one of 70,000---all of them mendicants who had ended
their defilements.

Vessabhū had three gatherings of disciples---one of 80,000,
one of 70,000, and one of 60,000---all of them mendicants who had ended
their defilements.

Kakusandha had one gathering of disciples---40,000 mendicants who had
ended their defilements.

Koṇāgamana had one gathering of disciples---30,000
mendicants who had ended their defilements.

Kassapa had one gathering of disciples---20,000 mendicants who had ended
their defilements.

I have had one gathering of disciples---1,250 mendicants who had ended
their defilements.[^22]

Vipassī had as chief attendant a mendicant named Asoka.
Sikhī had as chief attendant a mendicant named
Khemaṅkara. Vessabhū had as chief attendant a
mendicant named Upasanta. Kakusandha had as chief attendant a mendicant
named Buddhija. Koṇāgamana had as chief attendant a
mendicant named Sotthija. Kassapa had as chief attendant a mendicant
named Sabbamitta. I have as chief attendant a mendicant named Ānanda.

Vipassī's father was King Bandhumā, his birth
mother was Queen Bandhumatī, and their capital city was
named Bandhumatī.

Sikhī's father was King Aruṇa,[^23] his birth
mother was Queen Pabhāvatī,[^24] and their capital city was
named Aruṇavatī.[^25]

Vessabhū's father was King Suppatita,[^26] his birth mother
was Queen Vassavatī, and their capital city was named
Anoma.

Kakusandha's father was the brahmin Aggidatta,[^27] and his birth mother
was the brahmin lady Visākhā.[^28] At that time the king
was Khema, whose capital city was named Khemavatī.[^29]

Koṇāgamana's father was the brahmin
Yaññadatta,[^30] and his birth mother was the brahmin lady
Uttarā.[^31] At that time the king was Sobha, whose capital
city was named Sobhavatī.[^32]

Kassapa's father was the brahmin Brahmadatta,[^33] and his birth mother
was the brahmin lady Dhanavatī.[^34] At that time the king
was Kikī,[^35] whose capital city was named Varanasi.

In this life, my father was King Suddhodana,[^36] my birth mother was
Queen Māyā,[^37] and our capital city was Kapilavatthu."

That is what the Buddha said. When he had spoken, the Holy One got up
from his seat and entered his dwelling.

Soon after the Buddha left, those mendicants discussed among themselves:

"It's incredible, reverends, it's amazing! The Realized One has such
psychic power and might! For he is able to recollect the birth, names,
clans, lifespan, chief disciples, and gatherings of disciples of the
Buddhas of the past who have become fully quenched, cut off
proliferation, cut off the track, finished off the cycle, and
transcended all suffering. He knows their birth, names, clans, conduct,
qualities, wisdom, meditation, and freedom.

Is it because the Realized One has clearly comprehended the principle of
the teachings that he can recollect all these things?[^38] Or did
deities tell him?" But this conversation among those mendicants was left
unfinished.

Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to
the pavilion by the kareri tree, where he sat on the seat spread out and
addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants, what were you sitting talking
about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?"

The mendicants told him what had happened, adding, "This was our
conversation that was unfinished when the Buddha arrived."

"It is because the Realized One has clearly comprehended the principle
of the teachings that he can recollect all these things. And the deities
also told me.

Would you like to hear a further Dhamma talk on the subject of past
lives?"

"Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! Let the Buddha
give a further Dhamma talk on the subject of past lives. The mendicants
will listen and remember it."

"Well then, mendicants, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Ninety-one eons ago, the Buddha Vipassī arose in the
world, perfected and fully awakened. He was born as an aristocrat into
an aristocrat family. His clan was Koṇḍañña. He lived for
80,000 years. He was awakened at the root of a patala tree. He had a
fine pair of chief disciples named Khaṇḍa and Tissa. He had
three gatherings of disciples---one of 6,800,000, one of 100,000, and
one of 80,000---all of them mendicants who had ended their defilements.
He had as chief attendant a mendicant named Asoka. His father was King
Bandhumā, his birth mother was Queen
Bandhumatī, and their capital city was named
Bandhumatī.

## 2. What's Normal For One Intent on Awakening

When Vipassī, the being intent on awakening, passed away
from the host of joyful gods, he was conceived in his mother's womb,
mindful and aware.[^39] This is normal in such a case.[^40]

It's normal that, when the being intent on awakening passes away from
the host of joyful gods, he is conceived in his mother's womb. And
then---in this world with its gods, Māras, and divinities,
this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans---an
immeasurable, magnificent light appears, surpassing the glory of the
gods. Even in the boundless void of interstellar space---so utterly dark
that even the light of the moon and the sun, so mighty and powerful,
makes no impression---an immeasurable, magnificent light appears,
surpassing the glory of the gods.[^41] And the sentient beings reborn
there recognize each other by that light: 'So, it seems other sentient
beings have been reborn here!'[^42] And this ten-thousandfold galaxy
shakes and rocks and trembles. And an immeasurable, magnificent light
appears in the world, surpassing the glory of the gods. This is normal
in such a case.

It's normal that, when the being intent on awakening is conceived in his
mother's belly, four gods approach to guard the four quarters, so that
no human or non-human or anyone at all shall harm the being intent on
awakening or his mother.[^43] This is normal in such a case.

It's normal that, when the being intent on awakening is conceived in his
mother's belly, she becomes naturally ethical. She refrains from killing
living creatures, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and beer, wine,
and liquor intoxicants.[^44] This is normal in such a case.

It's normal that, when the being intent on awakening is conceived in his
mother's belly, she no longer feels sexual desire for men, and she
cannot be violated by a man of lustful intent. This is normal in such a
case.

It's normal that, when the being intent on awakening is conceived in his
mother's belly, she obtains the five kinds of sensual stimulation and
amuses herself, supplied and provided with them.[^45] This is normal in
such a case.

It's normal that, when the being intent on awakening is conceived in his
mother's belly, no afflictions beset her. She's happy and free of bodily
fatigue. And she sees the being intent on awakening in her womb, whole
in his major and minor limbs, not deficient in any faculty. Suppose
there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful, eight-faceted,
well-worked, transparent, clear, and unclouded, endowed with all good
qualities. And it was strung with a thread of blue, yellow, red, white,
or golden brown. And someone with clear eyes were to take it in their
hand and examine it: 'This beryl gem is naturally beautiful,
eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent, clear, and unclouded, endowed
with all good qualities. And it's strung with a thread of blue, yellow,
red, white, or golden brown.'

In the same way, when the being intent on awakening is conceived in his
mother's belly, no afflictions beset her. She's happy and free of bodily
fatigue. And she sees the being intent on awakening in her womb, whole
in his major and minor limbs, not deficient in any faculty. This is
normal in such a case.

It's normal that, seven days after the being intent on awakening is
born, his mother passes away and is reborn in the host of joyful
gods.[^46] This is normal in such a case.

It's normal that, while other women carry the infant in the womb for
nine or ten months before giving birth, not so the mother of the being
intent on awakening. She gives birth after exactly ten months.[^47] This
is normal in such a case.

It's normal that, while other women give birth while sitting or lying
down, not so the mother of the being intent on awakening. She only gives
birth standing up.[^48] This is normal in such a case.

It's normal that, when the being intent on awakening emerges from his
mother's womb, gods receive him first, then humans. This is normal in
such a case.

It's normal that, when the being intent on awakening emerges from his
mother's womb, before he reaches the ground, four gods receive him and
place him before his mother, saying: 'Rejoice, O Queen! An illustrious
son is born to you.' This is normal in such a case.

It's normal that, when the being intent on awakening emerges from his
mother's womb, he emerges already clean, unsoiled by waters, mucus,
blood, or any other kind of impurity, pure and clean. Suppose a
jewel-treasure was placed on a cloth from Kāsi. The jewel
would not soil the cloth, nor would the cloth soil the jewel.[^49] Why
is that? Because of the cleanliness of them both.

In the same way, when the being intent on awakening emerges from his
mother's womb, he emerges already clean, unsoiled by waters, mucus,
blood, or any other kind of impurity, pure and clean. This is normal in
such a case.

It's normal that, when the being intent on awakening emerges from his
mother's womb, two showers of water appear from the sky, one cool, one
warm, for bathing the being intent on awakening and his mother. This is
normal in such a case.

It's normal that, as soon as he's born, the being intent on awakening
stands firm with his own feet on the ground. Facing north, he takes
seven strides with a white parasol held above him, surveys all quarters,
and makes this dramatic proclamation: 'I am the foremost in the world! I
am the eldest in the world! I am the first in the world! This is my last
rebirth; now there'll be no more future lives.'[^50] This is normal in
such a case.

It's normal that, when the being intent on awakening emerges from his
mother's womb, then---in this world with its gods, Māras,
and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and
humans---an immeasurable, magnificent light appears, surpassing the
glory of the gods. Even in the boundless void of interstellar space---so
utterly dark that even the light of the moon and the sun, so mighty and
powerful, makes no impression---an immeasurable, magnificent light
appears, surpassing the glory of the gods. And the sentient beings
reborn there recognize each other by that light: 'So, it seems other
sentient beings have been reborn here!' And this ten-thousandfold galaxy
shakes and rocks and trembles. And an immeasurable, magnificent light
appears in the world, surpassing the glory of the gods. This is normal
in such a case.

## 3. The Thirty-Two Marks of a Great Man

When Prince Vipassī was born, they announced it to King
Bandhumā,[^51] 'Sire, your son is born! Let your majesty
examine him!' When the king had examined the prince, he had the brahmin
soothsayers summoned and said to them,[^52] 'Gentlemen, please examine
the prince.' When they had examined him they said to the king, 'Rejoice,
O King! An illustrious son is born to you. You are fortunate, so very
fortunate, to have a son such as this born in this family! For the
prince has the thirty-two marks of a great man. A great man who
possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other.[^53] If he
stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and
principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves
stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures. He has
the following seven treasures:[^54] the wheel, the elephant, the horse,
the jewel, the woman, the householder, and the commander as the seventh
treasure. He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic,
crushing the armies of his enemies. After conquering this land girt by
sea, he reigns by principle, without rod or sword. But if he goes forth
from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully
awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world.

And what are the marks which he possesses?[^55]

He has well-planted feet.[^56]

On the soles of his feet there are thousand-spoked wheels, with rims and
hubs, complete in every detail.[^57]

He has stretched heels.[^58]

He has long fingers.[^59]

His hands and feet are tender.[^60]

He has serried hands and feet.[^61]

The tops of his feet are arched.[^62]

His calves are like those of an antelope.[^63]

When standing upright and not bending over, the palms of both hands
touch the knees.[^64]

His private parts are covered in a foreskin.[^65]

He is golden colored; his skin shines like lustrous gold.[^66]

He has delicate skin, so delicate that dust and dirt don't stick to his
body.[^67]

His hairs grow one per pore.[^68]

His hairs stand up; they're blue-black and curl clockwise.[^69]

His body is tall and straight-limbed.[^70]

He has bulging muscles in seven places.[^71]

His chest is like that of a lion.[^72]

He is filled out between the shoulders.[^73]

He has the proportional circumference of a banyan tree: the span of his
arms equals the height of his body.[^74]

His torso is cylindrical.

He has ridged taste buds.[^75]

His jaw is like that of a lion.

He has forty teeth.

His teeth are even.[^76]

His teeth have no gaps.

His teeth are perfectly white.

He has a large tongue.[^77]

He has the voice of the Divinity, like a cuckoo's call.

His eyes are indigo.[^78]

He has eyelashes like a cow's.[^79]

Between his eyebrows there grows a tuft, soft and white like
cotton-wool.

The crown of his head is like a turban.[^80]

These are the thirty-two marks of a great man that the prince has. A
great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other.
If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch. But if
he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected
one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world.'

## 4. How He Came to be Known as Vipassī

Then King Bandhumā had the brahmin soothsayers dressed in
unworn clothes and satisfied all their needs.[^81] Then the king
appointed nursemaids for Prince Vipassī.[^82] Some suckled
him, some bathed him, some held him, and some carried him on their hip.
From when he was born, a white parasol was held over him night and day,
with the thought, 'Don't let cold, heat, grass, dust, or damp bother
him.' He was dear and beloved by many people, like a blue water lily, or
a pink or white lotus. He was always passed from hip to hip.

From when he was born, his voice was charming, graceful, sweet, and
lovely. It was as sweet as the song of a cuckoo-bird found in the
Himalayas.

From when he was born, Prince Vipassī had the power of
clairvoyance which manifested as a result of past deeds, by which he
could see for a league all around both by day and by night.[^83]

And he was unblinkingly watchful, like the gods of the thirty-three. And
because it was said that he was unblinkingly watchful, he came to be
known as 'Vipassī'.[^84]

Then while King Bandhumā was sitting in judgment, he'd sit
Prince Vipassī in his lap and explain the case to him. And
sitting there in his father's lap, Vipassī would thoroughly
consider the case and draw a conclusion using a logical procedure. So
this was all the more reason for him to be known as
'Vipassī'.[^85]

Then King Bandhumā had three stilt longhouses built for
him---one for the winter, one for the summer, and one for the rainy
season, and provided him with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
Prince Vipassī stayed in a stilt longhouse without coming
downstairs for the four months of the rainy season, where he was
entertained by musicians---none of them men.

_*The first recitation section.*_

## 5. The Old Man

Then, after many years, many hundred years, many thousand years had
passed, Prince Vipassī addressed his charioteer,[^86] 'My
dear charioteer, harness the finest chariots. We will go to a park and
see the scenery.'

'Yes, sir,' replied the charioteer. He harnessed the chariots and
informed the prince, 'Sire, the finest chariots are harnessed. Please go
at your convenience.' Then Prince Vipassī mounted a fine
carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out for the park.

Along the way he saw an elderly man, bent double, crooked, leaning on a
staff, trembling as he walked, ailing, past his prime. He addressed his
charioteer, 'My dear charioteer, what has that man done? For his hair
and his body are unlike those of other men.'

'That, Your Majesty, is called an old man.'

'But why is he called an old man?'

'He's called an old man because now he has not long to live.'

'But my dear charioteer, am I liable to grow old? Am I not exempt from
old age?'

'Everyone is liable to grow old, Your Majesty, including you. No-one is
exempt from old age.'

'Well then, my dear charioteer, that's enough of the park for today.
Let's return to the royal compound.'[^87]

'Yes, Your Majesty,' replied the charioteer and did so.

Back at the royal compound, the prince brooded, miserable and sad:[^88]
'Curse this thing called rebirth, since old age will come to anyone
who's born.'

Then King Bandhumā summoned the charioteer and said, 'My
dear charioteer, I hope the prince enjoyed himself at the park? I hope
he was happy there?'

'No, Your Majesty, the prince didn't enjoy himself at the park.'

'But what did he see on the way to the park?' And the charioteer told
the king about seeing the old man and the prince's reaction.

## 6. The Sick Man

Then King Bandhumā thought, 'Prince Vipassī
must not renounce the throne. He must not go forth from the lay life to
homelessness. And the words of the brahmin soothsayers must not come
true.'[^89] To this end he provided the prince with even more of the
five kinds of sensual stimulation, with which the prince amused himself.

Then, after many thousand years had passed, Prince Vipassī
had his charioteer drive him to the park once more.[^90]

Along the way he saw a man who was sick, suffering, gravely ill,
collapsed in his own urine and feces, being picked up by some and put
down by others. He addressed his charioteer, 'My dear charioteer, what
has that man done? For his eyes and his voice are unlike those of other
men.'

'That, Your Majesty, is called a sick man.'

'But why is he called a sick man?'

'He's called a sick man; hopefully he will recover from that illness.'

'But my dear charioteer, am I liable to fall sick? Am I not exempt from
sickness?'

'Everyone is liable to fall sick, Your Majesty, including you. No-one is
exempt from sickness.'

'Well then, my dear charioteer, that's enough of the park for today.
Let's return to the royal compound.'

'Yes, Your Majesty,' replied the charioteer and did so.

Back at the royal compound, the prince brooded, miserable and sad:
'Curse this thing called rebirth, since old age and sickness will come
to anyone who's born.'

Then King Bandhumā summoned the charioteer and said, 'My
dear charioteer, I hope the prince enjoyed himself at the park? I hope
he was happy there?'

'No, Your Majesty, the prince didn't enjoy himself at the park.'

'But what did he see on the way to the park?' And the charioteer told
the king about seeing the sick man and the prince's reaction.

## 7. The Dead Man

Then King Bandhumā thought, 'Prince Vipassī
must not renounce the throne. He must not go forth from the lay life to
homelessness. And the words of the brahmin soothsayers must not come
true.' To this end he provided the prince with even more of the five
kinds of sensual stimulation, with which the prince amused himself.

Then, after many thousand years had passed, Prince Vipassī
had his charioteer drive him to the park once more.

Along the way he saw a large crowd gathered making a bier out of
garments of different colors.[^91] He addressed his charioteer, 'My dear
charioteer, why is that crowd making a bier?'

'That, Your Majesty, is for someone who's departed.'

'Well then, drive the chariot up to the departed.'

'Yes, Your Majesty,' replied the charioteer, and did so.

When the prince saw the corpse of the departed, he addressed the
charioteer, 'But why is he called departed?'

'He's called departed because now his mother and father, his relatives
and kin shall see him no more, and he shall never again see them.'

'But my dear charioteer, am I liable to die? Am I not exempt from death?
Will the king and queen and my other relatives and kin see me no more?
And shall I never again see them?'

'Everyone is liable to die, Your Majesty, including you. No-one is
exempt from death. The king and queen and your other relatives and kin
shall see you no more, and you shall never again see them.'

'Well then, my dear charioteer, that's enough of the park for today.
Let's return to the royal compound.'

'Yes, Your Majesty,' replied the charioteer and did so.

Back at the royal compound, the prince brooded, miserable and sad:
'Curse this thing called rebirth, since old age, sickness, and death
will come to anyone who's born.'

Then King Bandhumā summoned the charioteer and said, 'My
dear charioteer, I hope the prince enjoyed himself at the park? I hope
he was happy there?'

'No, Your Majesty, the prince didn't enjoy himself at the park.'

'But what did he see on the way to the park?' And the charioteer told
the king about seeing the dead man and the prince's reaction.

## 8. The Renunciate

Then King Bandhumā thought, 'Prince Vipassī
must not renounce the throne. He must not go forth from the lay life to
homelessness. And the words of the brahmin soothsayers must not come
true.' To this end he provided the prince with even more of the five
kinds of sensual stimulation, with which the prince amused himself.

Then, after many thousand years had passed, Prince Vipassī
had his charioteer drive him to the park once more.

Along the way he saw a man, a renunciate with shaven head, wearing an
ocher robe.[^92] He addressed his charioteer, 'My dear charioteer, what
has that man done? For his head and his clothes are unlike those of
other men.'

'That, Your Majesty, is called a renunciate.'

'But why is he called a renunciate?'

'He is called a renunciate because he celebrates principled and fair
conduct, skillful actions, good deeds, harmlessness, and sympathy for
living creatures.'[^93]

'Then I celebrate the one called a renunciate, who celebrates principled
and fair conduct, skillful actions, good deeds, harmlessness, and
sympathy for living creatures! Well then, drive the chariot up to that
renunciate.'

'Yes, Your Majesty,' replied the charioteer, and did so.

Then Prince Vipassī said to that renunciate, 'My good man,
what have you done? For your head and your clothes are unlike those of
other men.'

'Sire, I am what is called a renunciate.'

'But why are you called a renunciate?'

'I am called a renunciate because I celebrate principled and fair
conduct, skillful actions, good deeds, harmlessness, and sympathy for
living creatures.'

'Then I celebrate the one called a renunciate, who celebrates principled
and fair conduct, skillful actions, good deeds, harmlessness, and
sympathy for living creatures!'

## 9. The Going Forth

Then the prince addressed the charioteer, 'Well then, my dear
charioteer, take the chariot and return to the royal compound. I shall
shave off my hair and beard right here, dress in ocher robes, and go
forth from the lay life to homelessness.'[^94]

'Yes, Your Majesty,' replied the charioteer and did so.

Then Prince Vipassī shaved off his hair and beard, dressed
in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.

## 10. A Great Crowd Goes Forth

A large crowd of 84,000 people in the capital of Bandhumatī
heard that Vipassī had gone forth. It occurred to them,
'This must be no ordinary teaching and training, no ordinary going forth
in which Prince Vipassī has gone forth. If even the prince
goes forth, why don't we do the same?'

Then that great crowd of 84,000 people shaved off their hair and beard,
dressed in ocher robes, and followed the one intent on awakening,
Vipassī, by going forth from the lay life to
homelessness.[^95] Escorted by that assembly, Vipassī
wandered on tour among the villages, towns, and capital cities.[^96]

Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, 'It's
not appropriate for me to live in a crowd. Why don't I live alone,
withdrawn from the group?' After some time he withdrew from the group to
live alone. The 84,000 went one way, but Vipassī went
another.

## 11. Vipassī's Reflections

Then as Vipassī, the one intent on awakening, was in
private retreat in his dwelling, this thought came to his mind,[^97]
'Alas, this world has fallen into trouble. It's born, grows old, dies,
passes away, and is reborn, yet it doesn't understand how to escape from
this suffering, from old age and death.[^98] Oh, when will an escape be
found from this suffering, from old age and death?'

Then Vipassī thought, 'When what exists is there old age
and death? What is a condition for old age and death?'[^99] Then,
through rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended
with wisdom,[^100] 'When rebirth exists there's old age and death.
Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.'[^101]

Then Vipassī thought, 'When what exists is there rebirth?
What is a condition for rebirth?'[^102] Then, through rational
application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom,
'When continued existence exists there's rebirth. Continued existence is
a condition for rebirth.'[^103]

Then Vipassī thought, 'When what exists is there continued
existence? What is a condition for continued existence?' Then, through
rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with
wisdom, 'When grasping exists there's continued existence. Grasping is a
condition for continued existence.'[^104]

Then Vipassī thought, 'When what exists is there grasping?
What is a condition for grasping?' Then, through rational application of
mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom, 'When craving
exists there's grasping. Craving is a condition for grasping.'[^105]

Then Vipassī thought, 'When what exists is there craving?
What is a condition for craving?' Then, through rational application of
mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom, 'When feeling
exists there's craving. Feeling is a condition for craving.'[^106]

Then Vipassī thought, 'When what exists is there feeling?
What is a condition for feeling?' Then, through rational application of
mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom, 'When contact
exists there's feeling. Contact is a condition for feeling.'[^107]

Then Vipassī thought, 'When what exists is there contact?
What is a condition for contact?' Then, through rational application of
mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom, 'When the six sense
fields exist there's contact. The six sense fields are a condition for
contact.'[^108]

Then Vipassī thought, 'When what exists are there the six
sense fields? What is a condition for the six sense fields?' Then,
through rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended
with wisdom, 'When name and form exist there are the six sense fields.
Name and form are a condition for the six sense fields.'[^109]

Then Vipassī thought, 'When what exists are there name and
form? What is a condition for name and form?' Then, through rational
application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom,
'When consciousness exists there are name and form. Consciousness is a
condition for name and form.'[^110]

Then Vipassī thought, 'When what exists is there
consciousness? What is a condition for consciousness?' Then, through
rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with
wisdom, 'When name and form exist there's consciousness. Name and form
are a condition for consciousness.'[^111]

Then Vipassī thought, 'This consciousness turns back from
name and form, and doesn't go beyond that.'[^112] It is to this extent
that one may be reborn, grow old, die, pass away, or reappear. That is:
Name and form are conditions for consciousness. Consciousness is a
condition for name and form. Name and form are conditions for the six
sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. Contact
is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. Craving
is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued
existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a
condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and
distress to come to be.[^113] That is how this entire mass of suffering
originates.'

'Origination, origination.' Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom,
realization, and light that arose in Vipassī, the one
intent on awakening, regarding teachings not learned before from
another.[^114]

Then Vipassī thought, 'When what doesn't exist is there no
old age and death? When what ceases do old age and death cease?' Then,
through rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended
with wisdom, 'When rebirth doesn't exist there's no old age and death.
When rebirth ceases, old age and death cease.'

Then Vipassī thought, 'When what doesn't exist is there no
rebirth? When what ceases does rebirth cease?' Then, through rational
application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom,
'When continued existence doesn't exist there's no rebirth. When
continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases.'

Then Vipassī thought, 'When what doesn't exist is there no
continued existence? When what ceases does continued existence cease?'
Then, through rational application of mind, Vipassī
comprehended with wisdom, 'When grasping doesn't exist there's no
continued existence. When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases.'

Then Vipassī thought, 'When what doesn't exist is there no
grasping? When what ceases does grasping cease?' Then, through rational
application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom,
'When craving doesn't exist there's no grasping. When craving ceases,
grasping ceases.'

Then Vipassī thought, 'When what doesn't exist is there no
craving? When what ceases does craving cease?' Then, through rational
application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom,
'When feeling doesn't exist there's no craving. When feeling ceases,
craving ceases.'

Then Vipassī thought, 'When what doesn't exist is there no
feeling? When what ceases does feeling cease?' Then, through rational
application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom,
'When contact doesn't exist there's no feeling. When contact ceases,
feeling ceases.'

Then Vipassī thought, 'When what doesn't exist is there no
contact? When what ceases does contact cease?' Then, through rational
application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom,
'When the six sense fields don't exist there's no contact. When the six
sense fields cease, contact ceases.'

Then Vipassī thought, 'When what doesn't exist are there no
six sense fields? When what ceases do the six sense fields cease?' Then,
through rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended
with wisdom, 'When name and form don't exist there are no six sense
fields. When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease.'

Then Vipassī thought, 'When what doesn't exist are there no
name and form? When what ceases do name and form cease?' Then, through
rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with
wisdom, 'When consciousness doesn't exist there are no name and form.
When consciousness ceases, name and form cease.'

Then Vipassī thought, 'When what doesn't exist is there no
consciousness? When what ceases does consciousness cease?' Then, through
rational application of mind, Vipassī comprehended with
wisdom, 'When name and form don't exist there's no consciousness. When
name and form cease, consciousness ceases.'

Then Vipassī thought, 'I have discovered the path to
awakening. That is:[^115] When name and form cease, consciousness
ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and
form cease, the six sense fields cease. When the six sense fields cease,
contact ceases. When contact ceases, feeling ceases. When feeling
ceases, craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When
grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence
ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow,
lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease. That is how this entire
mass of suffering ceases.'

'Cessation, cessation.' Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom,
realization, and light that arose in Vipassī, the one
intent on awakening, regarding teachings not learned before from
another.[^116]

After some time he meditated observing rise and fall in the five
grasping aggregates.[^117] 'Such is form, such is the origin of form,
such is the ending of form. Such is feeling, such is the origin of
feeling, such is the ending of feeling. Such is perception, such is the
origin of perception, such is the ending of perception. Such are
choices, such is the origin of choices, such is the ending of
choices.[^118] Such is consciousness, such is the origin of
consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.'[^119] Meditating
like this his mind was soon freed from defilements by not
grasping.[^120]

_*The second recitation section.*_

## 12. The Appeal of the Divinity

Then the Blessed One Vipassī, the perfected one, the fully
awakened Buddha, thought,[^121] 'Why don't I teach the Dhamma?'[^122]

Then he thought, 'This principle I have discovered is deep, hard to see,
hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic,
subtle, comprehensible to the astute.[^123] But people like clinging,
they love it and enjoy it.[^124] It's hard for them to see this topic;
that is, specific conditionality, dependent origination.[^125] It's also
hard for them to see this topic; that is, the stilling of all
activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving,
fading away, cessation, extinguishment.[^126] And if I were to teach the
Dhamma, others might not understand me, which would be wearying and
troublesome for me.'[^127]

And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor
learned before in the past, occurred to him:[^128]

> 'I've struggled hard to realize this,\
> enough with trying to explain it!\
> Those mired in greed and hate\
> can't really understand this teaching.
>
> It goes against the stream, subtle,\
> deep, obscure, and very fine.\
> Those besotted by greed cannot see,\
> for they're shrouded in a mass of darkness.'[^129]

So, as the Buddha Vipassī reflected like this, his mind
inclined to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.[^130]

Then a certain Great Divinity, knowing the Buddha Vipassī's
train of thought, thought,[^131] 'Alas! The world will be lost, the
world will perish! For the mind of the Blessed One Vipassī,
the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, inclines to remaining
passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.' Then, as easily as a strong person
would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the realm of
divinity and reappeared in front of the Buddha Vipassī. He
arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, raised his
joined palms toward the Buddha Vipassī, and said, 'Sir, let
the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach the
Dhamma![^132] There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They're
in decline because they haven't heard the teaching. There will be those
who understand the teaching!'[^133]

When he said this, the Buddha Vipassī said to him, 'I too
thought this, Divinity, "Why don't I teach the Dhamma?" Then it occurred
to me, "If I were to teach the Dhamma, others might not understand me,
which would be wearying and troublesome for me."

So, as I reflected like this, my mind inclined to remaining passive, not
to teaching the Dhamma.'

For a second time, and a third time that Great Divinity begged the
Buddha to teach.

Then, understanding the Divinity's invitation, the Buddha
Vipassī surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha, out of
his compassion for sentient beings.[^134] And he saw sentient beings
with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes;
with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and
with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them
lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while
others did not.[^135] It's like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink
or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without
rising above it, thriving underwater. Some of them sprout and grow in
the water reaching the water's surface. And some of them sprout and grow
in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water
clinging to them.

In the same way, the Buddha Vipassī saw sentient beings
with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes.

Then that Great Divinity, knowing the Buddha Vipassī's
train of thought, addressed him in verse:

> 'Standing high on a rocky mountain,\
> you can see the people all around.\
> In just the same way, All-seer, so intelligent,\
> having ascended the Temple of Truth,\
> rid of sorrow, look upon the people\
> swamped with sorrow,\
> \>oppressed by rebirth and old age.
>
> Rise, hero! Victor in battle, leader of the caravan,\
> wander the world free of debt.\
> Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma!\
> There will be those who understand!'

Then the Buddha Vipassī addressed that Great Divinity in
verse:

> 'Flung open are the doors to freedom from death!\
> Let those with ears to hear commit to faith.[^136]\
> Thinking it would be troublesome, Divinity,\
> \>I did not teach\
> the sophisticated, sublime Dhamma among humans.'

Then the Great Divinity, knowing that his request for the Buddha
Vipassī to teach the Dhamma had been granted, bowed and
respectfully circled him, keeping him on his right, before vanishing
right there.

## 13. The Chief Disciples

Then the Blessed One Vipassī, the perfected one, the fully
awakened Buddha, thought, 'Who should I teach first of all? Who will
quickly understand this teaching?' Then he thought, 'That
Khaṇḍa, the king's son, and Tissa, the high priest's son,
are astute, competent, clever, and have long had little dust in their
eyes.[^137] Why don't I teach them first of all? They will quickly
understand this teaching.'

Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm,
he vanished from the tree of awakening and reappeared near the capital
city of Bandhumatī, in the deer park named Sanctuary.[^138]

Then the Buddha Vipassī addressed the park keeper,[^139]
'My dear park keeper, please enter the city and say this to the king's
son Khaṇḍa and the high priest's son Tissa: "Sirs, the
Blessed One Vipassī, the perfected one, the fully awakened
Buddha, has arrived at Bandhumatī and is staying in the
deer park named Sanctuary. He wishes to see you."'

'Yes, sir,' replied the park keeper, and did as he was asked.

Then the king's son Khaṇḍa and the high priest's son Tissa
had the finest carriages harnessed. Then they mounted a fine carriage
and, along with other fine carriages, set out from
Bandhumatī for the Sanctuary. They went by carriage as far
as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the Buddha
Vipassī on foot. They bowed and sat down to one side.

The Buddha Vipassī taught them step by step, with a talk on
giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of
sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of
renunciation. And when he knew that their minds were ready, pliable, rid
of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching
of the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just
as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye, in that very
seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the king's
son Khaṇḍa and the high priest's son Tissa: 'Everything
that has a beginning has an end.'

They saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. They went
beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and
independent of others regarding the Teacher's instructions. They said to
the Buddha Vipassī, 'Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he
were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out
the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with
clear eyes can see what's there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear
in many ways. We go for refuge to the Blessed One and to the teaching.
Sir, may we receive the going forth and ordination in the Buddha's
presence?'

And they received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha
Vipassī's presence.[^140] Then the Buddha
Vipassī educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them
with a Dhamma talk. He explained the drawbacks of conditioned phenomena,
so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of extinguishment. Being taught
like this their minds were soon freed from defilements by not
grasping.[^141]

## 14. The Going Forth of the Large Crowd

A large crowd of 84,000 people in the capital of Bandhumatī
heard that the Blessed One Vipassī, the perfected one, the
fully awakened Buddha, had arrived at Bandhumatī and was
staying in the deer park named Sanctuary. And they heard that the king's
son Khaṇḍa and the high priest's son Tissa had shaved off
their hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and gone forth from the
lay life to homelessness in the Buddha's presence. It occurred to them,
'This must be no ordinary teaching and training, no ordinary going forth
in which the king's son Khaṇḍa and the high priest's son
Tissa have gone forth. If even they go forth, why don't we do the same?'
Then those 84,000 people left Bandhumatī for the deer park
named Sanctuary, where they approached the Buddha Vipassī,
bowed and sat down to one side.

The Buddha Vipassī taught them step by step, with a talk on
giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of
sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of
renunciation. And when he knew that their minds were ready, pliable, rid
of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching
of the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just
as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye, in that very
seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in those
84,000 people: 'Everything that has a beginning has an end.'

They saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. They went
beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and
independent of others regarding the Teacher's instructions. They said to
the Buddha Vipassī, 'Excellent, sir! Excellent!' And just
like Khaṇḍa and Tissa they asked for and received
ordination. Then the Buddha taught them further.

Being taught like this their minds were soon freed from defilements by
not grasping.

## 15. The 84,000 Who Had Gone Forth Previously

The 84,000 people who had gone forth previously also heard: 'It seems
the Blessed One Vipassī, the perfected one, the fully
awakened Buddha, has arrived at Bandhumatī and is staying
in the deer park named Sanctuary. And he is teaching the Dhamma!' Then
they too went to see the Buddha Vipassī, realized the
Dhamma, went forth, and became freed from defilements.

## 16. The Allowance to Wander

Now at that time a large Saṅgha of 6,800,000 mendicants
were residing at Bandhumatī. As the Buddha
Vipassī was in private retreat this thought came to his
mind, 'The Saṅgha residing at Bandhumatī now
is large. What if I was to urge them:

"Wander forth, mendicants, for the welfare and happiness of the people,
out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness
of gods and humans.[^142] Let not two go by one road. Teach the Dhamma
that's good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end,
meaningful and well-phrased. And reveal a spiritual practice that's
entirely full and pure. There are beings with little dust in their eyes.
They're in decline because they haven't heard the teaching. There will
be those who understand the teaching! But when six years have passed,
you must all come to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic
code."'[^143]

Then a certain Great Divinity, knowing the Buddha Vipassī's
train of thought, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract
their arm, vanished from the realm of divinity and reappeared in front
of the Buddha Vipassī. He arranged his robe over one
shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha
Vipassī, and said, 'That's so true, Blessed One! That's so
true, Holy One! The Saṅgha residing at
Bandhumatī now is large. Please urge them to wander, as you
thought. And sir, I'll make sure that when six years have passed the
mendicants will return to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic
code.'

That's what that Great Divinity said. Then he bowed and respectfully
circled the Buddha Vipassī, keeping him on his right side,
before vanishing right there.

Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha Vipassī came out of
retreat and addressed the mendicants, telling them all that had
happened. Then he said,

'Wander forth, mendicants, for the welfare and happiness of the people,
out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness
of gods and humans. Let not two go by one road. Teach the Dhamma that's
good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end,
meaningful and well-phrased. And reveal a spiritual practice that's
entirely full and pure. There are beings with little dust in their eyes.
They're in decline because they haven't heard the teaching. There will
be those who understand the teaching! But when six years have passed,
you must all come to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic
code.'

Then most of the mendicants departed to wander the country that very
day.

Now at that time there were 84,000 monasteries in the Black Plum Tree
Land.[^144] And when the first year came to an end the deities raised
the cry: 'Good sirs, the first year has ended. Now five years remain.
When five years have passed, you must all go to Bandhumatī
to recite the monastic code.'

And when the second year ... the third year ... the fourth year ... the
fifth year came to an end, the deities raised the cry: 'Good sirs, the
fifth year has ended. Now one year remains. When one year has passed,
you must all go to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code.'

And when the sixth year came to an end the deities raised the cry: 'Good
sirs, the sixth year has ended. Now is the time that you must go to
Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code.' Then that very day
the mendicants went to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic
code. Some went by their own psychic power, and some by the psychic
power of the deities.

And there the Blessed One Vipassī, the perfected one, the
fully awakened Buddha, recited the monastic code thus:[^145]

> 'Patient acceptance is the ultimate fervor.[^146]\
> Extinguishment is the ultimate, say the Buddhas.[^147]\
> No true renunciate injures another,\
> nor does an ascetic hurt another.
>
> Not to do any evil;[^148]\
> to embrace the good;[^149]\
> to purify one's mind:[^150]\
> this is the instruction of the Buddhas.[^151]
>
> Not speaking ill nor doing harm;\
> restraint in the monastic code;[^152]\
> moderation in eating;\
> staying in remote lodgings;\
> commitment to the higher mind---[^153]\
> this is the instruction of the Buddhas.'

## 17. Being Informed by Deities

This one time, mendicants, I was staying near Ukkaṭṭhā, in
the Subhaga Forest at the root of a magnificent sal tree.[^154] As I was
in private retreat this thought came to mind, 'It's not easy to find an
abode of sentient beings where I haven't previously abided in all this
long time, except for the gods of the pure abodes.[^155] Why don't I go
to see them?'

Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, I
vanished from the Subhaga Forest and reappeared with the gods of Aviha.

In that order of gods, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of
deities approached me, bowed, stood to one side, and said to me,[^156]
'Ninety-one eons ago, good sir, the Buddha Vipassī arose in
the world, perfected and fully awakened. He was born as an aristocrat
into an aristocrat family. Koṇḍañña was his clan. He lived
for 80,000 years. He was awakened at the root of a patala tree. He had a
fine pair of chief disciples named Khaṇḍa and Tissa. He had
three gatherings of disciples---one of 6,800,000, one of 100,000, and
one of 80,000---all of them mendicants who had ended their defilements.
He had as chief attendant a mendicant named Asoka. His father was King
Bandhumā, his birth mother was Queen
Bandhumatī, and their capital city was named
Bandhumatī. And such was his renunciation, such his going
forth, such his striving, such his awakening, and such his rolling forth
of the wheel of Dhamma.[^157] And good sir, after leading the spiritual
life under that Buddha Vipassī we lost our desire for
sensual pleasures and were reborn here.'[^158]

And other deities came and similarly recounted the details of the
Buddhas Sikhī, Vessabhū, Kakusandha,
Koṇāgamana, and Kassapa.[^159]

In that order of gods, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of
deities approached me, bowed, stood to one side, and said to me, 'In the
present fortunate eon, good sir, you have arisen in the world, perfected
and fully awakened. You were born as an aristocrat into an aristocrat
family. Gotama is your clan. For you the lifespan is short, brief, and
fleeting. A long-lived person lives for a century or a little more. You
were awakened at the root of a peepal tree. You have a fine pair of
chief disciples named Sāriputta and
Moggallāna. You have had one gathering of disciples---1,250
mendicants who had ended their defilements. You have as chief attendant
a mendicant named Ānanda. Your father was King Suddhodana, your birth
mother was Queen Māyā, and your capital city was
Kapilavatthu. And such was your renunciation, such your going forth,
such your striving, such your awakening, and such your rolling forth of
the wheel of Dhamma. And good sir, after leading the spiritual life
under you we lost our desire for sensual pleasures and were reborn
here.'

Then together with the gods of Aviha I went to see the gods of Atappa
... the gods fair to see ... and the fair seeing gods. Then together
with all these gods I went to see the gods of Akaniṭṭha,
where we had a similar conversation.

And that is how the Realized One is able to recollect the birth, names,
clans, lifespan, chief disciples, and gatherings of disciples of the
Buddhas of the past who have become fully quenched, cut off
proliferation, cut off the track, finished off the cycle, and
transcended all suffering. It is both because I have clearly
comprehended the principle of the teachings, and also because the
deities told me."[^160]

That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants approved what
the Buddha said.
