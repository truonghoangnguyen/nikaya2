# DN 18 With Janavasabha

_**Janavasabhasutta**_

## 1. Declaring the Rebirths of People From Ñātika and Elsewhere

[So I have heard.]{.smallcaps} At one time the Buddha was staying at
Ñātika in the brick house.[^578]

Now at that time the Buddha was explaining the rebirths of devotees all
over the nations; the Kāsis and Kosalans, Vajjis and
Mallas, Cetīs and Vacchas, Kurus and Pañcālas,
Macchas and Sūrasenas:[^579]

"This one was reborn here, while that one was reborn there.

Over fifty devotees in Ñātika have passed away having ended
the five lower fetters. They've been reborn spontaneously, and will be
extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.[^580]

More than ninety devotees in Ñātika have passed away having
ended three fetters, and weakened greed, hate, and delusion. They're
once-returners, who will come back to this world once only, then make an
end of suffering.

More than five hundred devotees in Ñātika have passed away
having ended three fetters. They're stream-enterers, not liable to be
reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening."

When the devotees of Ñātika heard about the Buddha's
answers to those questions, they became uplifted and overjoyed, full of
rapture and happiness.

Venerable Ānanda heard of the Buddha's statements and the
Ñātikans' happiness.

## 2. Ānanda's Suggestion

Then Venerable Ānanda thought, "But there were also Magadhan
devotees---many, and of long standing too---who have passed away.[^581]
You'd think that Aṅga and Magadha were empty of devotees
who have passed away! But they too had confidence in the Buddha, the
teaching, and the Saṅgha, and had fulfilled their ethics.
The Buddha hasn't declared their passing. It would be good to do so, for
many people would gain confidence, and so be reborn in a good place.

That King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha was a just and
principled king who benefited the brahmins and householders, and people
of town and country.[^582] People still sing his praises: 'That just and
principled king, who made us so happy, has passed away. Life was good
under his dominion.'[^583] He too had confidence in the Buddha, the
teaching, and the Saṅgha, and had fulfilled his ethics.
People say: 'Until his dying day, King Bimbisāra sang the
Buddha's praises!'[^584] The Buddha hasn't declared his passing. It
would be good to do so, for many people would gain confidence, and so be
reborn in a good place.

Besides, the Buddha was awakened in Magadha;[^585] so why hasn't he
declared the rebirth of the Magadhan devotees? If he fails to do so,
they will be dejected."

After pondering the fate of the Magadhan devotees alone in private,
Ānanda rose at the crack of dawn and went to see the Buddha. He bowed,
sat down to one side, and told the Buddha of his concerns, finishing by
saying, "Why hasn't the Buddha declared the rebirth of the Magadhan
devotees? If he fails to do so, they will be dejected." Then Ānanda,
after making this suggestion regarding the Magadhan devotees, got up
from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him
on his right, before leaving.[^586]

Soon after Ānanda had left, the Buddha robed up in the morning and,
taking his bowl and robe, entered Ñātika for alms. He
wandered for alms in Ñātika. After the meal, on his return
from almsround, he washed his feet and entered the brick house. He paid
attention, applied the mind, and concentrated wholeheartedly on the fate
of Magadhan devotees, and sat on the seat spread out, thinking,[^587] "I
shall know their destiny, where they are reborn in the next life." And
he saw where they had been reborn.

Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat. Emerging
from the brick house, he sat on the seat spread out in the shade of the
porch.

Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to him, "Sir, you look so serene; your face seems to
shine owing to the clarity of your faculties. Have you been abiding in a
peaceful meditation today, sir?"

The Buddha then recounted what had happened since speaking to Ānanda,
revealing that he had seen the destiny of the Magadhan devotees. He
continued:

## 3. Janavasabha the Spirit

"Then, Ānanda, a vanished spirit called out: 'I am Janavasabha, Blessed
One! I am Janavasabha, Holy One!' Ānanda, do you recall having
previously heard such a name as Janavasabha?"[^588]

"No, sir. But when I heard the word, I got goosebumps! I thought, 'This
must be no ordinary spirit to bear such an exalted name as
Janavasabha.'"[^589]

"After making himself heard while vanished, Ānanda, a very beautiful
spirit appeared in front of me.[^590] And for a second time he called
out: 'I am Bimbisāra, Blessed One! I am
Bimbisāra, Holy One! This is the seventh time I am reborn
in the company of the Great King Vessavaṇa. When I pass
away from here, I can become a king of men.[^591]

> Seven from here, seven from there---\
> fourteen transmigrations in all.[^592]\
> I remember these lives\
> where I lived before.

For a long time I've known that I won't be reborn in the underworld, but
that I still hope to become a once-returner.'[^593]

'It's incredible and amazing that you, the venerable spirit Janavasabha,
should say:

"For a long time I've been aware that I won't be reborn in the
underworld" and also "But I still hope to become a once-returner." But
from what source do you know that you've achieved such a high
distinction?'[^594]

'None other than the Blessed One's instruction! None other than the Holy
One's instruction![^595] From the day I had absolute devotion to the
Buddha I have known that I won't be reborn in the underworld, but that I
still hope to become a once-returner. Just now, sir, I had been sent out
by the great king Vessavaṇa to the great king
Virūḷhaka's presence on some business, and on the way I saw
the Buddha giving his attention to the fate of the Magadhan devotees.
But it comes as no surprise that I have heard and learned the fate of
the Magadhan devotees in the presence of the great king
Vessavaṇa as he was speaking to his assembly. It occurred
to me, "I shall see the Buddha and inform him of this." These are the
two reasons I've come to see the Buddha.

## 4. The Council of the Gods

Sir, it was more than a few days ago---on the fifteenth day sabbath on
the full moon day at the entry to the rainy season---when all the gods
of the thirty-three were sitting together in the Hall of Justice.[^596]
A large assembly of gods was sitting all around, and the four great
kings were seated at the four quarters.[^597]

The Great King Dhataraṭṭha was seated to the east, facing
west, in front of his gods. The Great King Virūḷhaka was
seated to the south, facing north, in front of his gods. The Great King
Virūpakkha was seated to the west, facing east, in front of
his gods. The Great King Vessavaṇa was seated to the north,
facing south, in front of his gods. When the gods of the thirty-three
have a gathering like this, that is how they are seated. After that come
our seats.

Sir, those gods who had been recently reborn in the company of the
thirty-three after leading the spiritual life under the Buddha outshone
the other gods in beauty and glory. The gods of the thirty-three became
uplifted and overjoyed at that, full of rapture and happiness, saying,
"The heavenly hosts swell, while the titan hosts dwindle!"

Seeing the joy of those gods, Sakka, lord of gods, celebrated with these
verses:

> "The gods rejoice---\
> the thirty-three with their Lord---\
> revering the Realized One,\
> and the natural excellence of the teaching;
>
> and seeing the new gods,\
> so beautiful and glorious,\
> who have come here after leading\
> the spiritual life under the Buddha!
>
> They outshine the others\
> in beauty, glory, and lifespan.\
> Here are the distinguished disciples\
> of he whose wisdom is vast.
>
> Seeing this, they delight---\
> the thirty-three with their Lord---\
> revering the Realized One,\
> and the natural excellence of the teaching."

The gods of the thirty-three became even more uplifted and overjoyed at
that, saying: "The heavenly hosts swell, while the titan hosts dwindle!"

Then the gods of the thirty-three, having considered and deliberated on
the matter for which they were seated together in the Hall of Justice,
advised and instructed the four great kings on the subject. Each one,
having been advised, stood at his own seat without departing.[^598]

> The Kings were instructed,\
> and heeded good advice.\
> With clear and peaceful minds,\
> they stood by their own seats.

Then in the northern quarter a magnificent light arose and radiance
appeared, surpassing the glory of the gods.[^599] Then Sakka, lord of
gods, addressed the gods of the thirty-three, "As indicated by the
signs---light arising and radiance appearing---The Divinity will appear.
For this is the precursor for the appearance of the Divinity, namely
light arising and radiance appearing."

> As indicated by the signs,\
> The Divinity will appear.\
> For this is the sign of the Divinity:\
> a light vast and great.

## 5. On Sanaṅkumāra

Then the gods of the thirty-three sat in their own seats, saying, "We
shall find out what has caused that light, and only when we have
realized it shall we go to it."[^600] And the four great kings did
likewise.

Hearing that, the gods of the thirty-three agreed in unison, "We shall
find out what has caused that light, and only when we have realized it
shall we go to it."

When the divinity Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the
thirty-three, he does so after manifesting in a solid life-form.[^601]
For a Divinity's normal appearance is imperceptible in the visual range
of the gods of the thirty-three.[^602] When the divinity
Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the thirty-three, he
outshines the other gods in beauty and glory, as a golden statue
outshines the human form.[^603]

When the divinity Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the
thirty-three, not a single god in that assembly greets him by bowing
down or rising up or inviting him to a seat. They all sit silently on
their couches with their joined palms raised, thinking, "Now the
divinity Sanaṅkumāra will sit on the couch of whatever god
he chooses." And the god on whose couch the Divinity sits is overjoyed
and brimming with happiness, like a king on the day of his coronation.

Then the divinity Sanaṅkumāra manifested in a solid
life-form, taking on the appearance of the youth
Pañcasikha, and appeared to the gods of the
thirty-three.[^604] Rising into the air, he sat cross-legged in the sky,
like a strong man might sit cross-legged on a well-appointed couch or on
level ground. Seeing the joy of those gods, the divinity
Sanaṅkumāra celebrated with these verses:

> "The gods rejoice---\
> the thirty-three with their Lord---\
> revering the Realized One,\
> and the natural excellence of the teaching;
>
> and seeing the new gods,\
> so beautiful and glorious,\
> who have come here after leading\
> the spiritual life under the Buddha!
>
> They outshine the others\
> in beauty, glory, and lifespan.\
> Here are the distinguished disciples\
> of he whose wisdom is vast.
>
> Seeing this, they delight---\
> the thirty-three with their Lord---\
> revering the Realized One,\
> and the natural excellence of the teaching!"

That is the topic on which the divinity Sanaṅkumāra
spoke.[^605] And while he was speaking on that topic, his voice had
eight qualities: it was clear, comprehensible, charming, audible, lucid,
undistorted, deep, and resonant.[^606] He makes sure his voice is
intelligible as far as the assembly goes, but the sound doesn't extend
outside the assembly. When someone has a voice like this, they're said
to have the voice of the Divinity.

Then the divinity Sanaṅkumāra, having manifested
thirty-three life-forms, sat down on the couches of each of the gods of
the thirty-three and addressed them, "What do the good gods of the
thirty-three think? How the Buddha has acted for the welfare and
happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit,
welfare, and happiness of gods and humans![^607] For consider those who
have gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the
Saṅgha, and have fulfilled their ethics. When their bodies
break up, after death, some are reborn in the company of the gods who
control what is imagined by others, some with the gods who love to
imagine, some with the joyful gods, some with the gods of Yama, some
with the gods of the thirty-three, and some with the gods of the four
great kings.[^608] And at the very least they swell the hosts of the
centaurs."

That is the topic on which the divinity Sanaṅkumāra spoke.
And hearing the sound of the Divinity speaking on that topic, the gods
fancied, "The one sitting on my couch is the only one speaking."

> When one is speaking,\
> all the forms speak.\
> When one sits in silence,\
> they all remain silent.
>
> But those gods imagine---\
> the thirty-three with their Lord---\
> that the one on their seat\
> is the only one to speak.

Next the divinity Sanaṅkumāra merged into one corporeal
form. Then he sat on the couch of Sakka, lord of gods, and addressed the
gods of the thirty-three:[^609]

## 6. Developing the Bases of Psychic Power

"What do the good gods of the thirty-three think? How well described by
the Blessed One---who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully
awakened Buddha---are the four bases of psychic power! They are taught
for the amplification, burgeoning, and transformation of psychic
power.[^610] What four? It's when a mendicant develops the basis of
psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort.
They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to
energy, and active effort. They develop the basis of psychic power that
has immersion due to mental development, and active effort. They develop
the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to inquiry, and active
effort. These are the four bases of psychic power taught by the Buddha
for the amplification, burgeoning, and transformation of psychic power.

All the ascetics and brahmins in the past, future, or present who wield
the many kinds of psychic power do so by developing and cultivating
these four bases of psychic power. Gentlemen, do you see such psychic
might and power in me?"

"Yes, Great Divinity."

"I too became so mighty and powerful by developing and cultivating these
four bases of psychic power."

That is the topic on which the divinity Sanaṅkumāra spoke.
And having spoken about that, he addressed the gods of the thirty-three:

## 7. The Three Openings

"What do the good gods of the thirty-three think? How well understood by
the Buddha are the three opportunities for achieving happiness![^611]
What three?

First, take someone who lives mixed up with sensual pleasures and
unskillful qualities.[^612] After some time they hear the teaching of
the noble ones, rationally apply the mind to how it applies to them, and
practice accordingly. They live aloof from sensual pleasures and
unskillful qualities.[^613] That gives rise to pleasure, and more than
pleasure, happiness,[^614] like the joy that's born from gladness. This
is the first opportunity for achieving happiness.

Next, take someone whose coarse physical, verbal, and mental processes
have not died down.[^615] After some time they hear the teaching of the
noble ones, rationally apply the mind to how it applies to them, and
practice accordingly. Their coarse physical, verbal, and mental
processes die down. That gives rise to pleasure, and more than pleasure,
happiness, like the joy that's born from gladness. This is the second
opportunity for achieving happiness.

Next, take someone who doesn't truly understand what is skillful and
what is unskillful,[^616] what is blameworthy and what is blameless,
what should be cultivated and what should not be cultivated, what is
inferior and what is superior, and what is on the side of dark and the
side of bright. After some time they hear the teaching of the noble
ones, rationally apply the mind to how it applies to them, and practice
accordingly. They truly understand what is skillful and what is
unskillful, and so on. Knowing and seeing like this, ignorance is given
up and knowledge arises. That gives rise to pleasure, and more than
pleasure, happiness, like the joy that's born from gladness. This is the
third opportunity for achieving happiness.

These are the three opportunities for achieving happiness that have been
understood by the Buddha."

That is the topic on which the divinity Sanaṅkumāra spoke.
And having spoken about that, he addressed the gods of the thirty-three:

## 8. Mindfulness Meditation

"What do the good gods of the thirty-three think? How well described by
the Buddha are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation! They are taught
for achieving what is skillful.[^617] What four?

It's when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body
internally---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and
displeasure for the world. As they meditate in this way, they become
rightly immersed in that, and rightly serene. Then they give rise to
knowledge and vision of other people's bodies externally.[^618]

They meditate observing an aspect of feelings internally ... Then they
give rise to knowledge and vision of other people's feelings externally.

They meditate observing an aspect of the mind internally ... Then they
give rise to knowledge and vision of other people's minds externally.

They meditate observing an aspect of principles internally---keen,
aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.
As they meditate in this way, they become rightly immersed in that, and
rightly serene. Then they give rise to knowledge and vision of other
people's principles externally.

These are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation taught by the Buddha
for achieving what is skillful."

That is the topic on which the divinity Sanaṅkumāra spoke.
And having spoken about that, he addressed the gods of the thirty-three:

## 9. Seven Prerequisites of Immersion

"What do the good gods of the thirty-three think? How well described by
the Buddha are the seven prerequisites of immersion for the development
and fulfillment of right immersion![^619] What seven? Right view, right
thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, and
right mindfulness. Unification of mind with these seven factors as
prerequisites is what is called noble right immersion 'with its vital
conditions' and also 'with its prerequisites'.

Right view gives rise to right thought. Right thought gives rise to
right speech. Right speech gives rise to right action. Right action
gives rise to right livelihood. Right livelihood gives rise to right
effort. Right effort gives rise to right mindfulness. Right mindfulness
gives rise to right immersion. Right immersion gives rise to right
knowledge. Right knowledge gives rise to right freedom.[^620]

If anything should be rightly described as 'a teaching that's well
explained by the Buddha, apparent in the present life, immediately
effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can
know it for themselves; and the doors to freedom from death are flung
open,' it's this.[^621] For the teaching is well explained by the
Buddha---apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting
inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for
themselves---and the doors to freedom from death are flung open.

Whoever has experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the
Saṅgha, and has the ethical conduct loved by the noble
ones; and whoever is spontaneously reborn, and is trained in the
teaching; more than 2,400,000 such Magadhan devotees have passed away
having ended three fetters. They're stream-enterers, not liable to be
reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.[^622] And there are
once-returners here, too.

> And as for the rest of folk,[^623]\
> who I think have shared in merit---\
> I couldn't even number them,\
> for fear of speaking falsely."

That is the topic on which the divinity Sanaṅkumāra spoke.
And while he was speaking on that topic, this thought came to the great
king Vessavaṇa, "Oh, how incredible, how amazing! That
there should be such a magnificent Teacher, and such a magnificent
exposition of the teaching! And that such achievements of high
distinction should be made known!"

And then the divinity Sanaṅkumāra, knowing the great king
Vessavaṇa's train of thought, said to him, "What does Great
King Vessavaṇa think? In the past, too, there was such a
magnificent Teacher, and such a magnificent exposition of the teaching!
And such achievements of high distinction were made known![^624] In the
future, too, there will be such a magnificent Teacher, and such a
magnificent exposition of the teaching! And such achievements of high
distinction will be made known!"

That, sir, is the topic on which the divinity Sanaṅkumāra
spoke to the gods of the thirty-three. And the great king
Vessavaṇa, having heard and learned it in the presence of
the Divinity as he was speaking on that topic, informed his own
assembly.'"[^625]

And the spirit Janavasabha, having heard and learned it in the presence
of the great king Vessavaṇa as he was speaking on that
topic to his own assembly, informed the Buddha. And the Buddha, having
heard and learned it in the presence of the spirit Janavasabha, and also
from his own direct knowledge, informed Venerable Ānanda. And Venerable
Ānanda, having heard and learned it in the presence of the Buddha,
informed the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.[^626] And that's how
this spiritual life has become successful and prosperous, extensive,
popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and
humans.[^627]
