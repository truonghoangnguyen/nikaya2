# DN 16 The Great Discourse on the Buddha's Extinguishment

_**Mahāparinibbānasutta**_

So I have heard.[^241] At one time the Buddha was staying
near Rājagaha, on the Vulture's Peak Mountain. Now at that
time King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of
Videha, wanted to invade the Vajjis.[^242] He declared: "I shall wipe
out these Vajjis, so mighty and powerful! I shall destroy them, and lay
ruin and devastation upon them!"[^243]

And then King Ajātasattu addressed Vassakāra
the brahmin minister of Magadha,[^244] "Please, brahmin, go to the
Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is
healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably. And then say:
'Sir, King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of
Videha, wants to invade the Vajjis. He says, "I shall wipe out these
Vajjis, so mighty and powerful! I shall destroy them, and lay ruin and
devastation upon them!"'[^245] Remember well how the Buddha answers and
tell it to me. For Realized Ones say nothing that is not so."[^246]

## 1. The Brahmin Vassakāra

"Yes, sir," Vassakāra replied. He had the finest carriages
harnessed. Then he mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine
carriages, set out from Rājagaha for the Vulture's Peak
Mountain.[^247] He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then
descended and approached the Buddha on foot, and exchanged greetings
with him.

When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one
side and said to the Buddha, "Mister Gotama, King
Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, bows
with his head to your feet. He asks if you are healthy and well, nimble,
strong, and living comfortably. Mister Gotama, King
Ajātasattu wants to invade the Vajjis. He has declared: 'I
shall wipe out these Vajjis, so mighty and powerful! I shall destroy
them, and lay ruin and devastation upon them!'"

## 2. Principles That Prevent Decline

Now at that time Venerable Ānanda was standing behind the Buddha fanning
him.[^248] Then the Buddha said to him, "Ānanda, have you heard that the
Vajjis meet frequently and have many meetings?"[^249]

"I have heard that, sir."

"As long as the Vajjis meet frequently and have many meetings, they can
expect growth, not decline.

Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis meet in harmony, leave in
harmony, and carry on their business in harmony?"[^250]

"I have heard that, sir."

"As long as the Vajjis meet in harmony, leave in harmony, and carry on
their business in harmony, they can expect growth, not decline.

Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis don't make new decrees or abolish
existing decrees, but proceed having undertaken the ancient Vajjian
traditions as they have been decreed?"[^251]

"I have heard that, sir."

"As long as the Vajjis don't make new decrees or abolish existing
decrees, but proceed having undertaken the ancient Vajjian traditions as
they have been decreed, they can expect growth, not decline.

Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and
venerate Vajjian elders, and think them worth listening to?"

"I have heard that, sir."

"As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate Vajjian
elders, and think them worth listening to, they can expect growth, not
decline.

Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis don't forcibly abduct the women
or girls of the clans and make them live with them?"[^252]

"I have heard that, sir."

"As long as the Vajjis don't forcibly abduct the women or girls of the
clans and make them live with them, they can expect growth, not decline.

Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and
venerate the Vajjian shrines, whether inner or outer, not neglecting the
proper spirit-offerings that were given and made in the past?"[^253]

"I have heard that, sir."

"As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Vajjian
shrines, whether inner or outer, not neglecting the proper
spirit-offerings that were given and made in the past, they can expect
growth, not decline.

Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis organize proper protection,
shelter, and security for perfected ones, so that more perfected ones
might come to the realm and those already here may live in
comfort?"[^254]

"I have heard that, sir."

"As long as the Vajjis organize proper protection, shelter, and security
for perfected ones, so that more perfected ones might come to the realm
and those already here may live in comfort, they can expect growth, not
decline."

Then the Buddha said to Vassakāra, "Brahmin, this one time
I was staying near Vesālī at the Sārandada
woodland shrine.[^255] There I taught the Vajjis these seven principles
that prevent decline.[^256] As long as these seven principles that
prevent decline last among the Vajjis, and as long as the Vajjis are
seen following them, they can expect growth, not decline."

When the Buddha had spoken, Vassakāra said to him, "Mister
Gotama, if the Vajjis follow even a single one of these principles they
can expect growth, not decline. How much more so all seven! King
Ajātasattu cannot defeat the Vajjis in war, unless by
bribery or by sowing dissension.[^257] Well, now, Mister Gotama, I must
go. I have many duties, and much to do."

"Please, brahmin, go at your convenience." Then Vassakāra
the brahmin, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, got
up from his seat and left.

## 3. Principles That Prevent Decline Among the Mendicants

Soon after he had left, the Buddha said to Ānanda, "Go, Ānanda, gather
all the mendicants staying in the vicinity of Rājagaha
together in the assembly hall."[^258]

"Yes, sir," replied Ānanda. He did what the Buddha asked. Then he went
back, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, "Sir, the mendicant
Saṅgha has assembled. Please, sir, go at your convenience."

Then the Buddha went to the assembly hall, where he sat on the seat
spread out and addressed the mendicants: "Mendicants, I will teach you
these seven principles that prevent decline.[^259] Listen and apply your
mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"As long as the mendicants meet frequently and have many meetings, they
can expect growth, not decline.[^260]

As long as the mendicants meet in harmony, leave in harmony, and carry
on their business in harmony, they can expect growth, not decline.[^261]

As long as the mendicants don't make new decrees or abolish existing
decrees, but undertake and follow the training rules as they have been
decreed, they can expect growth, not decline.[^262]

As long as the mendicants honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the
senior mendicants---of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and
leaders of the Saṅgha---and think them worth listening to,
they can expect growth, not decline.[^263]

As long as the mendicants don't fall under the sway of arisen craving
for future lives, they can expect growth, not decline.[^264]

As long as the mendicants take care to live in wilderness lodgings, they
can expect growth, not decline.[^265]

As long as the mendicants individually establish mindfulness, so that
more good-hearted spiritual companions might come, and those that have
already come may live comfortably, they can expect growth, not
decline.[^266]

As long as these seven principles that prevent decline last among the
mendicants, and as long as the mendicants are seen following them, they
can expect growth, not decline.

I will teach you seven more principles that prevent decline. ...[^267]

As long as the mendicants don't relish work, loving it and liking to
relish it, they can expect growth, not decline.[^268]

As long as they don't relish talk ...

sleep ...

company ...

they don't have corrupt wishes, falling under the sway of corrupt wishes
...[^269]

they don't have bad friends, companions, and associates ...

they don't stop half-way after achieving some insignificant distinction,
they can expect growth, not decline.[^270]

As long as these seven principles that prevent decline last among the
mendicants, and as long as the mendicants are seen following them, they
can expect growth, not decline.

I will teach you seven more principles that prevent decline. ...[^271]
As long as the mendicants are faithful ... conscientious ... prudent ...
learned ... energetic ... mindful ... wise, they can expect growth, not
decline. As long as these seven principles that prevent decline last
among the mendicants, and as long as the mendicants are seen following
them, they can expect growth, not decline.

I will teach you seven more principles that prevent decline. ...[^272]

As long as the mendicants develop the awakening factors of mindfulness
... investigation of principles ... energy ... rapture ... tranquility
... immersion ... equanimity, they can expect growth, not decline.

As long as these seven principles that prevent decline last among the
mendicants, and as long as the mendicants are seen following them, they
can expect growth, not decline.

I will teach you seven more principles that prevent decline. ...[^273]

As long as the mendicants develop the perceptions of impermanence ...
not-self ... ugliness ... drawbacks ... giving up ... fading away ...
cessation, they can expect growth, not decline.

As long as these seven principles that prevent decline last among the
mendicants, and as long as the mendicants are seen following them, they
can expect growth, not decline.

I will teach you six principles that prevent decline. ...[^274]

As long as the mendicants consistently treat their spiritual companions
with bodily kindness ... verbal kindness ... and mental kindness both in
public and in private, they can expect growth, not decline.

As long as the mendicants share without reservation any material things
they have gained by legitimate means, even the food placed in the
alms-bowl, using them in common with their ethical spiritual companions,
they can expect growth, not decline.

As long as the mendicants live according to the precepts shared with
their spiritual companions, both in public and in private---such
precepts as are intact, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating,
praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to
immersion---they can expect growth, not decline.

As long as the mendicants live according to the view shared with their
spiritual companions, both in public and in private---the view that is
noble and emancipating, and delivers one who practices it to the
complete end of suffering---they can expect growth, not decline.[^275]

As long as these six principles that prevent decline last among the
mendicants, and as long as the mendicants are seen following them, they
can expect growth, not decline."

And while staying there at the Vulture's Peak the Buddha often gave this
Dhamma talk to the mendicants:[^276]

"Such is ethics, such is immersion, such is wisdom. When immersion is
imbued with ethics it's very fruitful and beneficial.[^277] When wisdom
is imbued with immersion it's very fruitful and beneficial. When the
mind is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements,
namely, the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and
ignorance."[^278]

When the Buddha had stayed in Rājagaha as long as he
pleased, he addressed Venerable Ānanda, "Come, Ānanda, let's go to
Ambalaṭṭhikā."[^279]

"Yes, sir," Ānanda replied. Then the Buddha together with a large
Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Ambalaṭṭhikā,
where he stayed in the royal rest-house. And while staying there, too,
he often gave this Dhamma talk to the mendicants:

"Such is ethics, such is immersion, such is wisdom. When immersion is
imbued with ethics it's very fruitful and beneficial. When wisdom is
imbued with immersion it's very fruitful and beneficial. When the mind
is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements, namely,
the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance."

When the Buddha had stayed in Ambalaṭṭhikā as long as he
pleased, he addressed Venerable Ānanda, "Come, Ānanda, let's go to
Nāḷandā."

"Yes, sir," Ānanda replied. Then the Buddha together with a large
Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Nāḷandā, where
he stayed in Pāvārika's mango grove.

## 4. Sāriputta's Lion's Roar

Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to
one side, and said to him,[^280] "Sir, I have such confidence in the
Buddha that I believe there's no other ascetic or brahmin---whether
past, future, or present---whose direct knowledge is superior to the
Buddha when it comes to awakening."

"That's a grand and dramatic statement, Sāriputta. You've
roared a definitive, categorical lion's roar, saying: 'I have such
confidence in the Buddha that I believe there's no other ascetic or
brahmin---whether past, future, or present---whose direct knowledge is
superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.'

What about all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived
in the past? Have you comprehended their minds to know that those
Buddhas had such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such
meditation, or such freedom?"

"No, sir."

"And what about all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who
will live in the future? Have you comprehended their minds to know that
those Buddhas will have such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom,
or such meditation, or such freedom?"

"No, sir."

"And what about me, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha at
present? Have you comprehended my mind to know that I have such ethics,
or such teachings, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?"

"No, sir."

"Well then, Sāriputta, given that you don't comprehend the
minds of Buddhas past, future, or present, what exactly are you doing,
making such a grand and dramatic statement, roaring such a definitive,
categorical lion's roar?"

"Sir, though I don't comprehend the minds of Buddhas past, future, and
present, still I understand this by inference from the teaching.[^281]
Suppose there was a king's frontier citadel with fortified embankments,
ramparts, and arches, and a single gate. And it has a gatekeeper who is
astute, competent, and intelligent. He keeps strangers out and lets
known people in. As he walks around the patrol path, he doesn't see a
hole or cleft in the wall, not even one big enough for a cat to slip
out. He thinks: 'Whatever sizable creatures enter or leave the citadel,
all of them do so via this gate.'

In the same way, I understand this by inference from the teaching: 'All
the perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas---whether past, future, or
present---give up the five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that
weaken wisdom. Their mind is firmly established in the four kinds of
mindfulness meditation. They correctly develop the seven awakening
factors. And they wake up to the supreme perfect awakening.'"

And while staying at Nāḷandā, too, the Buddha often gave
this Dhamma talk to the mendicants:

"Such is ethics, such is immersion, such is wisdom. When immersion is
imbued with ethics it's very fruitful and beneficial. When wisdom is
imbued with immersion it's very fruitful and beneficial. When the mind
is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements, namely,
the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance."

## 5. The Drawbacks of Unethical Conduct

When the Buddha had stayed in Nāḷandā as long as he
pleased, he addressed Venerable Ānanda, "Come, Ānanda, let's go to
Pāṭali Village."[^282]

"Yes, sir," Ānanda replied. Then the Buddha together with a large
Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Pāṭali
Village.

The lay followers of Pāṭali Village heard that he had
arrived. So they went to see him, bowed, sat down to one side, and said
to him, "Sir, please consent to come to our guest house." The Buddha
consented with silence.

Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, the lay followers of
Pāṭali Village got up from their seat, bowed, and
respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they
went to the guest house, where they spread carpets all over, prepared
seats, set up a water jar, and placed an oil lamp. Then they went back
to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and told him of their
preparations, saying: "Please, sir, come at your convenience."

In the morning, the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, went
to the guest house together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.
Having washed his feet he entered the guest house and sat against the
central column facing east. The Saṅgha of mendicants also
washed their feet, entered the guest house, and sat against the west
wall facing east, with the Buddha right in front of them. The lay
followers of Pāṭali Village also washed their feet, entered
the guest house, and sat against the east wall facing west, with the
Buddha right in front of them.

Then the Buddha addressed them:

"Householders, there are these five drawbacks for an unethical person
because of their failure in ethics.[^283] What five?

Firstly, an unethical person loses great wealth on account of
negligence.[^284] This is the first drawback for an unethical person
because of their failure in ethics.

Furthermore, an unethical person gets a bad reputation. This is the
second drawback.

Furthermore, an unethical person enters any kind of assembly timid and
embarrassed, whether it's an assembly of aristocrats, brahmins,
householders, or ascetics. This is the third drawback.

Furthermore, an unethical person feels lost when they die.[^285] This is
the fourth drawback.

Furthermore, an unethical person, when their body breaks up, after
death, is reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
This is the fifth drawback.

These are the five drawbacks for an unethical person because of their
failure in ethics.

## 6. The Benefits of Ethical Conduct

There are these five benefits for an ethical person because of their
accomplishment in ethics. What five?

Firstly, an ethical person gains great wealth on account of diligence.
This is the first benefit.

Furthermore, an ethical person gets a good reputation. This is the
second benefit.

Furthermore, an ethical person enters any kind of assembly bold and
self-assured, whether it's an assembly of aristocrats, brahmins,
householders, or ascetics. This is the third benefit.

Furthermore, an ethical person dies not feeling lost. This is the fourth
benefit.

Furthermore, when an ethical person's body breaks up, after death,
they're reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. This is the fifth
benefit.

These are the five benefits for an ethical person because of their
accomplishment in ethics."

The Buddha spent much of the night educating, encouraging, firing up,
and inspiring the lay followers of Pāṭali Village with a
Dhamma talk. Then he dismissed them, "The night is getting late,
householders. Please go at your convenience."

"Yes, sir," replied the lay followers of Pāṭali Village.
They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha,
keeping him on their right, before leaving. Soon after they left the
Buddha entered a private cubicle.[^286]

## 7. Building a Citadel

Now at that time the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and
Vassakāra were building a citadel at Pāṭali
Village to keep the Vajjis out.[^287] At that time thousands of deities
were taking possession of building sites in Pāṭali
Village.[^288] Illustrious rulers or royal ministers inclined to build
houses at sites possessed by illustrious deities. Middling rulers or
royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by middling
deities. Lesser rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at
sites possessed by lesser deities.

With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha saw those
deities taking possession of building sites in Pāṭali
Village. The Buddha rose at the crack of dawn and addressed Ānanda,
"Ānanda, who is building a citadel at Pāṭali Village?"

"Sir, the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra are
building a citadel to keep the Vajjis out."

"It's as if they were building the citadel in consultation with the gods
of the thirty-three. With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman,
I saw those deities taking possession of building sites. Illustrious
rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by
illustrious deities. Middling rulers or royal ministers inclined to
build houses at sites possessed by middling deities. Lesser rulers or
royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by lesser
deities. As far as the civilized region extends, as far as the trading
zone extends, this will be the chief city: the Pāṭaliputta
trade center.[^289] But Pāṭaliputta will face three
threats: from fire, flood, and dissension."[^290]

Then the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra
approached the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the
greetings and polite conversation were over, they stood to one side and
said, "Would Mister Gotama together with the mendicant
Saṅgha please accept today's meal from me?" The Buddha
consented with silence.

Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, they went to their own
guest house, where they had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared.
Then they had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, "It's time,
Mister Gotama, the meal is ready."

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
went to their guest house together with the mendicant
Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then Sunidha
and Vassakāra served and satisfied the mendicant
Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with their own hands with
delicious fresh and cooked foods. When the Buddha had eaten and washed
his hand and bowl, Sunidha and Vassakāra took a low seat
and sat to one side.

The Buddha expressed his appreciation with these verses:[^291]

> "In the place he makes his dwelling,\
> having fed the astute\
> and the virtuous here,\
> the restrained spiritual practitioners,
>
> he should dedicate an offering[^292]\
> to the deities there.\
> Venerated, they venerate him;\
> honored, they honor him.
>
> After that they have sympathy for him,\
> like a mother for the child at her breast.\
> A man beloved of the deities\
> always sees nice things."[^293]

When the Buddha had expressed his appreciation to Sunidha and
Vassakāra with these verses, he got up from his seat and
left.

Sunidha and Vassakāra followed behind the Buddha, thinking,
"The gate through which the ascetic Gotama departs today shall be named
the Gotama Gate. The ford at which he crosses the Ganges River shall be
named the Gotama Ford."[^294]

Then the gate through which the Buddha departed was named the Gotama
Gate.

Then the Buddha came to the Ganges River.

Now at that time the Ganges was full to the brim so a crow could drink
from it. Wanting to cross from the near to the far shore, some people
were seeking a boat, some a dinghy, while some were tying up a
raft.[^295] But, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract
their arm, the Buddha, together with the mendicant Saṅgha,
vanished from the near shore and landed on the far shore.[^296]

He saw all those people wanting to cross over. Knowing the meaning of
this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:

> "Those who cross a deluge or stream[^297]\
> have built a bridge and left the marshes behind.\
> While some people are still tying a raft,\
> intelligent people have crossed over."

_*The first recitation section.*_

## 8. Talk on the Noble Truths

Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda, "Come, Ānanda, let's go to the
village of Koṭi."[^298]

"Yes, sir," Ānanda replied. Then the Buddha together with a large
Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at the village of
Koṭi, and stayed there.

There he addressed the mendicants:[^299]

"Mendicants, due to not understanding and not penetrating four noble
truths, both you and I have wandered and transmigrated for such a very
long time. What four? The noble truths of suffering, the origin of
suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to
the cessation of suffering. These noble truths of suffering, origin,
cessation, and the path have been understood and comprehended. Craving
for continued existence has been cut off; the conduit to rebirth is
ended; now there'll be no more future lives."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "Because of not truly seeing\
> the four noble truths,\
> we have transmigrated for a long time\
> from one rebirth to the next.
>
> But now that these truths have been seen,\
> the conduit to rebirth is eradicated.\
> The root of suffering is cut off,\
> now there'll be no more future lives."

And while staying at the village of Koṭi, too, the Buddha
often gave this Dhamma talk to the mendicants:

"Such is ethics, such is immersion, such is wisdom. When immersion is
imbued with ethics it's very fruitful and beneficial. When wisdom is
imbued with immersion it's very fruitful and beneficial. When the mind
is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements, namely,
the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance."

## 9. The Deaths in Ñātika

When the Buddha had stayed in the village of Koṭi as long
as he pleased, he said to Ānanda, "Come, Ānanda, let's go to the land of
the Ñātikas."[^300]

"Yes, sir," Ānanda replied. Then the Buddha together with a large
Saṅgha of mendicants arrived in the land of the
Ñātikas, where he stayed in the brick house at
Ñātika.[^301]

Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to him, "Sir, the monk named Sāḷha has
passed away in Ñātika. Where has he been reborn in his next
life?[^302] The nun named Nandā, the layman named Sudatta,
and the laywoman named Sujātā have passed away in
Ñātika. Where have they been reborn in the next life?[^303]
The laymen named Kakkaṭa,[^304] Kaḷibha,
Nikata, Kaṭissaha, Tuṭṭha,
Santuṭṭha, Bhadda, and Subhadda have passed away in
Ñātika. Where have they been reborn in the next life?"

"Ānanda, the monk Sāḷha had realized the undefiled freedom
of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, having realized it
with his own insight due to the ending of defilements.

The nun Nandā had ended the five lower fetters. She's been
reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to
return from that world.

The layman Sudatta had ended three fetters, and weakened greed, hate,
and delusion. He's a once-returner; he will come back to this world once
only, then make an end of suffering.

The laywoman Sujātā had ended three fetters. She's a
stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for
awakening.

The laymen Kakkaṭa, Kaḷibha, Nikata,
Kaṭissaha, Tuṭṭha, Santuṭṭha,
Bhadda, and Subhadda had ended the five lower fetters. They've been
reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to
return from that world.[^305]

Over fifty laymen in Ñātika have passed away having ended
the five lower fetters. They've been reborn spontaneously, and will be
extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.

More than ninety laymen in Ñātika have passed away having
ended three fetters, and weakened greed, hate, and delusion. They're
once-returners, who will come back to this world once only, then make an
end of suffering.

More than five hundred laymen in Ñātika have passed away
having ended three fetters. They're stream-enterers, not liable to be
reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.[^306]

## 10. The Mirror of the Teaching

It's no wonder that a human being should pass away. But if you should
come and ask me about it each and every time someone passes away, that
would be a bother for me.

So Ānanda, I will teach you the explanation of the Dhamma called 'the
mirror of the teaching'. A noble disciple who has this may declare of
themselves:[^307] 'I've finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm,
and the ghost realm. I've finished with all places of loss, bad places,
the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I'm not liable to be reborn in
the underworld, and am bound for awakening.'

And what is that mirror of the teaching?[^308]

It's when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the
Buddha:[^309] 'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha,
accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world,
supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans,
awakened, blessed.'[^310]

They have experiential confidence in the teaching: 'The teaching is well
explained by the Buddha---apparent in the present life, immediately
effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can
know it for themselves.'[^311]

They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: 'The
Saṅgha of the Buddha's disciples is practicing the way
that's good, sincere, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four
pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the
Buddha's disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods,
worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of
greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the
world.'[^312]

And a noble disciple's ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones,
unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by
sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion.[^313]

This is that mirror of the teaching."

And while staying there in Ñātika the Buddha often gave
this Dhamma talk to the mendicants:

"Such is ethics, such is immersion, such is wisdom. When immersion is
imbued with ethics it's very fruitful and beneficial. When wisdom is
imbued with immersion it's very fruitful and beneficial. When the mind
is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements, namely,
the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance."

When the Buddha had stayed in Ñātika as long as he pleased,
he addressed Venerable Ānanda, "Come, Ānanda, let's go to
Vesālī."

"Yes, sir," Ānanda replied. Then the Buddha together with a large
Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Vesālī, where
he stayed in Ambapālī's mango grove.[^314]

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:

"Mendicants, a mendicant should live mindful and aware.[^315] This is my
instruction to you.

And how is a mendicant mindful?[^316] It's when a mendicant meditates by
observing an aspect of the body---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of
covetousness and displeasure for the world.[^317] They meditate
observing an aspect of feelings ... mind ... principles---keen, aware,
and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.[^318]
That's how a mendicant is mindful.

And how is a mendicant aware? It's when a mendicant acts with
situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead
and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer
robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when
urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping,
waking, speaking, and keeping silent. That's how a mendicant is aware. A
mendicant should live mindful and aware. This is my instruction to you."

## 11. Ambapālī the Courtesan

Ambapālī the courtesan heard that the Buddha had arrived
and was staying in her mango grove.[^319] She had the finest carriages
harnessed. Then she mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine
carriages, set out from Vesālī for her own park. She went
by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached
the Buddha on foot. She bowed and sat down to one side. The Buddha
educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired her with a Dhamma talk.

Then she said to the Buddha, "Sir, may the Buddha together with the
mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow's meal from me."
The Buddha consented with silence. Then, knowing that the Buddha had
consented, Ambapālī got up from her seat, bowed, and
respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on her right, before
leaving.

The Licchavis of Vesālī also heard that the Buddha had
arrived and was staying in Ambapālī's mango grove. They had
the finest carriages harnessed. Then they mounted a fine carriage and,
along with other fine carriages, set out from Vesālī. Some
of the Licchavis were in blue, of blue color, clad in blue, adorned with
blue. And some were similarly colored in yellow, red, or white.[^320]

Then Ambapālī the courtesan collided with those Licchavi
youths, axle to axle, wheel to wheel, yoke to yoke.[^321] The Licchavis
said to her, "What, you wench Ambapālī, are you doing
colliding with us axle to axle, wheel to wheel, yoke to yoke?"[^322]

"Well, masters, it's because I've invited the Buddha for tomorrow's meal
together with the mendicant Saṅgha."

"Wench, give us that meal for a hundred thousand!"

"Masters, even if you were to give me Vesālī with her
provinces, I still wouldn't give that meal to you."[^323]

Then the Licchavis snapped their fingers, saying, "We've been beaten by
the aunty! We've been beaten by the aunty!"[^324] Then they continued on
to Ambapālī's mango grove.

The Buddha saw them coming off in the distance, and addressed the
mendicants: "Any of the mendicants who've never seen the gods of the
thirty-three, just have a look at the assembly of Licchavis. See the
assembly of Licchavis, check them out: they're just like the
thirty-three!"

The Licchavis went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then
descended and approached the Buddha on foot. They bowed to the Buddha,
sat down to one side, and the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and
inspired them with a Dhamma talk.

Then they said to the Buddha, "Sir, may the Buddha together with the
mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow's meal from us."

Then the Buddha said to the Licchavis, "I have already accepted
tomorrow's meal from Ambapālī the courtesan."

Then the Licchavis snapped their fingers, saying, "We've been beaten by
the aunty! We've been beaten by the aunty!"

And then those Licchavis approved and agreed with what the Buddha said.
They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha,
keeping him on their right, before leaving.

And when the night had passed Ambapālī had delicious fresh
and cooked foods prepared in her own park. Then she had the Buddha
informed of the time, saying, "Sir, it's time. The meal is ready."

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
went to the home of Ambapālī together with the mendicant
Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then
Ambapālī served and satisfied the mendicant
Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with her own hands with
delicious fresh and cooked foods.

When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hands and bowl,
Ambapālī took a low seat, sat to one side, and said to the
Buddha, "Sir, I present this park to the mendicant Saṅgha
headed by the Buddha."[^325]

The Buddha accepted the park.[^326]

Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired her with a
Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left.

And while staying at Vesālī, too, the Buddha often gave
this Dhamma talk to the mendicants:

"Such is ethics, such is immersion, such is wisdom. When immersion is
imbued with ethics it's very fruitful and beneficial. When wisdom is
imbued with immersion it's very fruitful and beneficial. When the mind
is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements, namely,
the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance."

## 12. Commencing the Rains at Beluva

When the Buddha had stayed in Ambapālī's mango grove as
long as he pleased, he addressed Venerable Ānanda, "Come, Ānanda, let's
go to the little village of Beluva."[^327]

"Yes, sir," Ānanda replied. Then the Buddha together with a large
Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at the little village of
Beluva, and stayed there.

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: "Mendicants, please enter the
rainy season residence with whatever friends or acquaintances you have
around Vesālī.[^328] I'll commence the rainy season
residence right here in the little village of Beluva."

"Yes, sir," those mendicants replied. They did as the Buddha said, while
the Buddha commenced the rainy season residence right there in the
little village of Beluva.

After the Buddha had commenced the rainy season residence, he fell
severely ill, struck by dreadful pains, close to death. But he endured
unbothered, with mindfulness and situational awareness. Then it occurred
to the Buddha, "It would not be appropriate for me to be fully
extinguished before informing my supporters and taking leave of the
mendicant Saṅgha.[^329] Why don't I forcefully suppress
this illness, stabilize the life force, and live on?"[^330]

So that is what he did. Then the Buddha's illness died down.

Soon after the Buddha had recovered from that sickness, he came out from
his dwelling and sat in the shade of the porch on the seat spread out.
Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to him, "Sir, it's fantastic that the Buddha is
comfortable and well. Because when the Buddha was sick, my body felt
like it was drugged. I was disorientated, and the teachings weren't
clear to me.[^331] Still, at least I was consoled by the thought that
the Buddha won't be fully extinguished without bringing something up
regarding the Saṅgha of mendicants."[^332]

"But what could the mendicant Saṅgha expect from me,
Ānanda?[^333] I've taught the Dhamma without making any distinction
between secret and public teachings.[^334] The Realized One doesn't have
the closed fist of a tutor when it comes to the teachings.[^335] If
there's anyone who thinks: 'I shall lead the mendicant
Saṅgha,' or 'the Saṅgha of mendicants is meant
for me,' let them bring something up regarding the Saṅgha.
But the Realized One doesn't think like this, so why should he bring
something up regarding the Saṅgha?[^336]

I'm now old, elderly and senior. I'm advanced in years and have reached
the final stage of life. I'm currently eighty years old. Just as a
decrepit old cart is kept going by a rope,[^337] in the same way, the
Realized One's body is kept going as if by a rope.[^338] Sometimes the
Realized One, not focusing on any signs, and with the cessation of
certain feelings, enters and remains in the signless immersion of the
heart. Only then does the Realized One's body become more
comfortable.[^339]

So Ānanda, live as your own island, your own refuge, with no other
refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other
refuge.[^340] And how does a mendicant do this? It's when a mendicant
meditates by observing an aspect of the body---keen, aware, and mindful,
rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. They meditate
observing an aspect of feelings ... mind ... principles---keen, aware,
and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. That's
how a mendicant is their own island, their own refuge, with no other
refuge. That's how the teaching is their island and their refuge, with
no other refuge.

Whether now or after I have passed, any who shall live as their own
island, their own refuge, with no other refuge; with the teaching as
their island and their refuge, with no other refuge---those mendicants
of mine who want to train shall be among the best of the best."[^341]

_*The second recitation section.*_

## 13. An Obvious Hint

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
entered Vesālī for alms. Then, after the meal, on his
return from almsround, he addressed Venerable Ānanda: "Ānanda, get your
sitting cloth.[^342] Let's go to the Cāpāla shrine for the
day's meditation."

"Yes, sir," replied Ānanda. Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind
the Buddha.

Then the Buddha went up to the Cāpāla shrine, where he sat
on the seat spread out. Ānanda bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one
side.

The Buddha said to him: "Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the
Udena, Gotamaka, Seven Maidens, Many Sons, Sārandada, and
Cāpāla Tree-shrines are all lovely.

Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic
power---made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated
them, and properly implemented them---may, if they wish, live for the
proper lifespan or what's left of it.[^343] The Realized One has
developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a
vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly
implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live for the
proper lifespan or what's left of it."

But Ānanda didn't get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious
hint, such a clear sign. He didn't beg the Buddha: "Sir, may the Blessed
One please remain for the proper lifespan! May the Holy One please
remain for the proper lifespan! That would be for the welfare and
happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit,
welfare, and happiness of gods and humans." For his mind was as if
possessed by Māra.[^344]

For a second time ... And for a third time, the Buddha said to Ānanda:
"Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Seven
Maidens, Many Sons, Sārandada, and Cāpāla
Tree-shrines are all lovely. Whoever has developed and cultivated the
four bases of psychic power---made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them
up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them---may, if they
wish, live for the proper lifespan or what's left of it. The Realized
One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made
them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and
properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live for
the proper lifespan or what's left of it."

But Ānanda didn't get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious
hint, such a clear sign. He didn't beg the Buddha: "Sir, may the Blessed
One please remain for the proper lifespan! May the Holy One please
remain for the proper lifespan! That would be for the welfare and
happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit,
welfare, and happiness of gods and humans." For his mind was as if
possessed by Māra.

Then the Buddha got up and said to Venerable Ānanda, "Go now, Ānanda, at
your convenience."

"Yes, sir," replied Ānanda. He rose from his seat, bowed, and
respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before
sitting at the root of a tree close by.

## 14. The Appeal of Māra

And then, not long after Ānanda had left, Māra the Wicked
went up to the Buddha, stood to one side, and said to him:[^345]

"Sir, may the Blessed One now be fully extinguished! May the Holy One
now be fully extinguished! Now is the time for the full extinguishment
of the Buddha.[^346] Sir, you once made this statement: 'Wicked One, I
shall not be fully extinguished until I have monk disciples who are
competent, educated, assured, learned, have memorized the teachings, and
practice in line with the teachings. Not until they practice properly,
living in line with the teaching. Not until they've learned their
tradition, and explain, teach, assert, establish, disclose, analyze, and
make it clear. Not until they can legitimately and completely refute the
doctrines of others that come up, and teach with a demonstrable
basis.'[^347]

Today you do have such monk disciples. May the Blessed One now be fully
extinguished! May the Holy One now be fully extinguished! Now is the
time for the full extinguishment of the Buddha.

Sir, you once made this statement: 'Wicked One, I shall not be fully
extinguished until I have nun disciples who are competent, educated,
assured, learned ...'[^348]

Today you do have such nun disciples. May the Blessed One now be fully
extinguished! May the Holy One now be fully extinguished! Now is the
time for the full extinguishment of the Buddha.

Sir, you once made this statement: 'Wicked One, I shall not be fully
extinguished until I have layman disciples who are competent, educated,
assured, learned ...'

Today you do have such layman disciples. May the Blessed One now be
fully extinguished! May the Holy One now be fully extinguished! Now is
the time for the full extinguishment of the Buddha.

Sir, you once made this statement: 'Wicked One, I shall not be fully
extinguished until I have laywoman disciples who are competent,
educated, assured, learned ...'

Today you do have such laywoman disciples. May the Blessed One now be
fully extinguished! May the Holy One now be fully extinguished! Now is
the time for the full extinguishment of the Buddha.

Sir, you once made this statement: 'Wicked One, I will not be fully
extinguished until my spiritual path is successful and prosperous,
extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are
gods and humans.'

Today your spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive,
popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and
humans. May the Blessed One now be fully extinguished! May the Holy One
now be fully extinguished! Now is the time for the full extinguishment
of the Buddha."

When this was said, the Buddha said to Māra, "Relax, Wicked
One. The full extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon.[^349]
Three months from now the Realized One will be fully
extinguished."[^350]

## 15. Surrendering the Life Force

So at the Cāpāla Tree-shrine the Buddha, mindful and aware,
surrendered the life force.[^351] When he did so there was a great
earthquake, awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the
sky.[^352] Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha
expressed this heartfelt sentiment:

> "Comparing the incomparable\
> \>with the creation of prolonged life,[^353]\
> the sage surrendered the life force.[^354]\
> Happy inside, serene,\
> he shattered self-creation like a suit of armor."[^355]

## 16. The Causes of Earthquakes

Then Venerable Ānanda thought, "How incredible, how amazing! That was a
really big earthquake! That was really a very big earthquake;
awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky! What's the
cause, what's the reason for a great earthquake?"

Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to him, "How incredible, sir, how amazing! That was a
really big earthquake! That was really a very big earthquake;
awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky! What's the
cause, what's the reason for a great earthquake?"

"Ānanda, there are these eight causes and reasons for a great
earthquake. What eight?

This great earth is grounded on water, the water is grounded on air, and
the air stands in space. At a time when a great wind blows, it stirs the
water, and the water stirs the earth.[^356] This is the first cause and
reason for a great earthquake.

Furthermore, there is an ascetic or brahmin with psychic power who has
achieved mastery of the mind, or a god who is mighty and powerful.
They've developed a limited perception of earth and a limitless
perception of water. They make the earth shake and rock and
tremble.[^357] This is the second cause and reason for a great
earthquake.

Furthermore, when the being intent on awakening passes away from the
host of joyful gods, he's conceived in his mother's belly, mindful and
aware. Then the earth shakes and rocks and trembles.[^358] This is the
third cause and reason for a great earthquake.

Furthermore, when the being intent on awakening comes out of his
mother's belly mindful and aware, the earth shakes and rocks and
trembles. This is the fourth cause and reason for a great earthquake.

Furthermore, when the Realized One realizes the supreme perfect
awakening, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles.[^359] This is the
fifth cause and reason for a great earthquake.

Furthermore, when the Realized One rolls forth the supreme Wheel of
Dhamma, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles.[^360] This is the sixth
cause and reason for a great earthquake.

Furthermore, when the Realized One, mindful and aware, surrenders the
life force, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles. This is the seventh
cause and reason for a great earthquake.

Furthermore, when the Realized One becomes fully extinguished in the
element of extinguishment with no residue, the earth shakes and rocks
and trembles.[^361] This is the eighth cause and reason for a great
earthquake.

These are the eight causes and reasons for a great earthquake.

## 17. Eight Assemblies

There are, Ānanda, these eight assemblies.[^362] What eight? The
assemblies of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and ascetics. An
assembly of the gods of the four great kings. An assembly of the gods of
the thirty-three. An assembly of Māras. An assembly of
divinities.[^363]

I recall having approached an assembly of hundreds of aristocrats. There
I used to sit with them, converse, and engage in discussion. And my
appearance and voice became just like theirs. I educated, encouraged,
fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk. But when I spoke they
didn't know: 'Who is this that speaks? Is it a god or a human?' And when
my Dhamma talk was finished I vanished. But when I vanished they didn't
know: 'Who was that who vanished? Was it a god or a human?'[^364]

I recall having approached an assembly of hundreds of brahmins ...
householders ... ascetics ... the gods of the four great kings ... the
gods of the thirty-three ... Māras ... divinities. There
too I used to sit with them, converse, and engage in discussion. And my
appearance and voice became just like theirs. I educated, encouraged,
fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk. But when I spoke they
didn't know: 'Who is this that speaks? Is it a god or a human?' And when
my Dhamma talk was finished I vanished. But when I vanished they didn't
know: 'Who was that who vanished? Was it a god or a human?'

These are the eight assemblies.

## 18. Eight Dimensions of Mastery

Ānanda, there are these eight dimensions of mastery.[^365] What eight?

Perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally, limited, both
pretty and ugly.[^366] Mastering them, they perceive: 'I know and see.'
This is the first dimension of mastery.

Perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally, limitless,
both pretty and ugly. Mastering them, they perceive: 'I know and see.'
This is the second dimension of mastery.

Not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally, limited,
both pretty and ugly.[^367] Mastering them, they perceive: 'I know and
see.' This is the third dimension of mastery.

Not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally,
limitless, both pretty and ugly. Mastering them, they perceive: 'I know
and see.' This is the fourth dimension of mastery.

Not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally that are
blue, with blue color and blue appearance.[^368] They're like a flax
flower that's blue, with blue color and blue appearance. Or a cloth from
Varanasi that's smoothed on both sides, blue, with blue color and blue
appearance. In the same way, not perceiving form internally, someone
sees forms externally, blue, with blue color and blue appearance.
Mastering them, they perceive: 'I know and see.' This is the fifth
dimension of mastery.

Not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally that are
yellow, with yellow color and yellow appearance. They're like a champak
flower that's yellow, with yellow color and yellow appearance. Or a
cloth from Varanasi that's smoothed on both sides, yellow, with yellow
color and yellow appearance. In the same way, not perceiving form
internally, someone sees forms externally that are yellow, with yellow
color and yellow appearance. Mastering them, they perceive: 'I know and
see.' This is the sixth dimension of mastery.

Not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally that are
red, with red color and red appearance. They're like a scarlet mallow
flower that's red, with red color and red appearance. Or a cloth from
Varanasi that's smoothed on both sides, red, with red color and red
appearance. In the same way, not perceiving form internally, someone
sees forms externally that are red, with red color and red appearance.
Mastering them, they perceive: 'I know and see.' This is the seventh
dimension of mastery.

Not perceiving form internally, someone sees forms externally that are
white, with white color and white appearance. They're like the morning
star that's white, with white color and white appearance. Or a cloth
from Varanasi that's smoothed on both sides, white, with white color and
white appearance. In the same way, not perceiving form internally,
someone sees forms externally that are white, with white color and white
appearance. Mastering them, they perceive: 'I know and see.' This is the
eighth dimension of mastery.

These are the eight dimensions of mastery.

## 19. The Eight Liberations

Ānanda, there are these eight liberations.[^369] What eight?

Having physical form, they see forms. This is the first liberation.

Not perceiving form internally, they see forms externally. This is the
second liberation.

They're focused only on beauty. This is the third liberation.

Going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions
of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that
'space is infinite', they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite
space. This is the fourth liberation.

Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that
'consciousness is infinite', they enter and remain in the dimension of
infinite consciousness. This is the fifth liberation.

Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that
'there is nothing at all', they enter and remain in the dimension of
nothingness. This is the sixth liberation.

Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, they enter and remain
in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. This is the
seventh liberation.

Going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor
non-perception, they enter and remain in the cessation of perception and
feeling. This is the eighth liberation.

These are the eight liberations.

Ānanda, this one time, when I was first awakened, I was staying in
Uruvelā at the goatherd's banyan tree on the bank of the
Nerañjarā River. Then Māra the wicked
approached me, stood to one side, and said: 'Sir, may the Blessed One
now be fully extinguished! May the Holy One now be fully extinguished!
Now is the time for the full extinguishment of the Buddha.' When he had
spoken, I said to Māra:

'Wicked One, I shall not be fully extinguished until I have monk
disciples ... nun disciples ... layman disciples ... laywoman disciples
who are competent, educated, assured, learned.

I shall not be fully extinguished until my spiritual path is successful
and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed
wherever there are gods and humans.'

Today, just now at the Cāpāla shrine Māra the
Wicked approached me once more with the same request, reminding me of my
former statement, and saying that those conditions had been fulfilled.

When he had spoken, I said to Māra: 'Relax, Wicked One. The
full extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon. Three months from
now the Realized One will be fully extinguished.' So today, just now at
the Cāpāla Tree-shrine, mindful and aware, I surrendered
the life force."

## 20. The Appeal of Ānanda

When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, "Sir, may the
Blessed One please remain for the proper lifespan! May the Holy One
please remain for the proper lifespan! That would be for the welfare and
happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit,
welfare, and happiness of gods and humans."

"Enough now, Ānanda. Do not beg the Realized One. Now is not the time to
beg the Realized One."

For a second time ... For a third time, Ānanda said to the Buddha, "Sir,
may the Blessed One please remain for the proper lifespan! May the Holy
One please remain for the proper lifespan! That would be for the welfare
and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the
benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans."

"Ānanda, do you have faith in the Realized One's awakening?"

"Yes, sir."

"Then why do you keep pressing me up to the third time?"

"Sir, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:[^370]
'Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic
power---made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated
them, and properly implemented them---may, if they wish, live for the
proper lifespan or what's left of it. The Realized One has developed and
cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a
basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them.
If he wished, the Realized One could live for the proper lifespan or
what's left of it.'"

"Do you have faith, Ānanda?"

"Yes, sir."

"Therefore, Ānanda, the misdeed is yours alone, the mistake is yours
alone. For even though the Realized One dropped such an obvious hint,
such a clear sign, you didn't beg me to remain for the proper lifespan,
or what's left of it.[^371] If you had begged me, I would have refused
you twice, but consented on the third time. Therefore, Ānanda, the
misdeed is yours alone, the mistake is yours alone.

Ānanda, this one time I was staying near Rājagaha, on the
Vulture's Peak Mountain.[^372] There I said to you: 'Ānanda,
Rājagaha is lovely, and so is the Vulture's Peak. Whoever
has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power---made them
a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly
implemented them---may, if they wish, live for the proper lifespan or
what's left of it. The Realized One has developed and cultivated the
four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them
up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the
Realized One could live for the proper lifespan or what's left of it.'
But you didn't get it, even though I dropped such an obvious hint, such
a clear sign. You didn't beg me to remain for the proper lifespan, or
what's left of it. If you had begged me, I would have refused you twice,
but consented on the third time. Therefore, Ānanda, the misdeed is yours
alone, the mistake is yours alone.

Ānanda, this one time I was staying right there near
Rājagaha, at the Gotama banyan tree ...[^373] at Bandit's
Cliff ...[^374] in the Sattapaṇṇi cave on the slopes of
Vebhara ...[^375] at the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili ...[^376]
in the Cool Grove, under the Snake's Hood Grotto ...[^377] in the Hot
Springs Monastery ...[^378] in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding
ground ...[^379] in Jīvaka's mango grove ... in the
Maddakucchi deer park ...[^380]

And in each place I said to you: 'Ānanda, Rājagaha is
lovely, and so are all these places. ... If he wished, the Realized One
could live for the proper lifespan or what's left of it.' But you didn't
get it, even though I dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign.
You didn't beg me to remain for the proper lifespan, or what's left of
it.

Ānanda, this one time I was staying right here near Vesālī,
at the Udena shrine ...[^381] at the Gotamaka shrine ...[^382] at the
Seven Maidens shrine ...[^383] at the Many Sons shrine ...[^384] at the
Sārandada shrine ...[^385] and just now, today at the
Cāpāla shrine. There I said to you: 'Ānanda,
Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Seven Maidens,
Many Sons, Sārandada, and Cāpāla Tree-shrines
are all lovely. Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of
psychic power---made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up,
consolidated them, and properly implemented them---may, if they wish,
live for the proper lifespan or what's left of it. The Realized One has
developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a
vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly
implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live for the
proper lifespan or what's left of it.' But you didn't get it, even
though I dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign. You didn't beg
me to remain for the proper lifespan, or what's left of it, saying:
'Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the proper lifespan! May the
Holy One please remain for the proper lifespan! That would be for the
welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for
the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.'

If you had begged me, I would have refused you twice, but consented on
the third time. Therefore, Ānanda, the misdeed is yours alone, the
mistake is yours alone.

Did I not prepare for this when I explained that we must be parted and
separated from all we hold dear and beloved? How could it possibly be so
that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to wear out should
not wear out? The Realized One has discarded, eliminated, released,
given up, relinquished, and surrendered the life force. He has
categorically stated: 'The full extinguishment of the Realized One will
be soon. Three months from now the Realized One will be fully
extinguished.' It's not possible for the Realized One, for the sake of
life, to take back the life force once it has been given up like
that.[^386]

Come, Ānanda, let's go to the Great Wood, the hall with the peaked
roof."[^387]

"Yes, sir," Ānanda replied.

So the Buddha went with Ānanda to the hall with the peaked roof, and
said to him, "Go, Ānanda, gather all the mendicants staying in the
vicinity of Vesālī together in the assembly hall."[^388]

"Yes, sir," replied Ānanda. He did what the Buddha asked, went up to
him, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, "Sir, the mendicant
Saṅgha has assembled. Please, sir, go at your convenience."

Then the Buddha went to the assembly hall, where he sat on the seat
spread out and addressed the mendicants:

"So, mendicants, having carefully memorized those things I have taught
you from my direct knowledge, you should cultivate, develop, and make
much of them so that this spiritual practice may last for a long time.
That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of
sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods
and humans.[^389] And what are those things I have taught from my direct
knowledge? They are: the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four
right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the
five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold
path.[^390]

These are the things I have taught from my direct knowledge. Having
carefully memorized them, you should cultivate, develop, and make much
of them so that this spiritual practice may last for a long time. That
would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy
for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and
humans."

Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:

"Come now, mendicants, I say to you all: 'Conditions fall apart. Persist
with diligence.'[^391] The full extinguishment of the Realized One will
be soon. Three months from now the Realized One will be fully
extinguished."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "I've reached a ripe old age,[^392]\
> and little of my life is left.\
> Having given it up, I'll depart;\
> I've made a refuge for myself.
>
> Diligent and mindful,\
> be of good virtues, mendicants!\
> With well-settled thoughts,[^393]\
> take good care of your minds.
>
> Whoever meditates diligently\
> in this teaching and training,\
> giving up transmigration through rebirths,\
> will make an end to suffering."

_*The third recitation section.*_

## 21. The Elephant Look

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
entered Vesālī for alms. Then, after the meal, on his
return from almsround, he turned to gaze back at Vesālī,
the way that elephants do. He said to Venerable Ānanda:[^394] "Ānanda,
this will be the last time the Realized One sees Vesālī.
Come, Ānanda, let's go to Wares Village."[^395]

"Yes, sir," Ānanda replied.

Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants
arrived at Wares Village, and stayed there. There the Buddha addressed
the mendicants:

"Mendicants, due to not understanding and not penetrating four things,
both you and I have wandered and transmigrated for such a very long
time. What four? Noble ethics,[^396] immersion, wisdom, and freedom.
These noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom have been understood
and comprehended. Craving for continued existence has been cut off; the
conduit to rebirth is ended; now there'll be no more future lives."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "Ethics, immersion, and wisdom,\
> and the supreme freedom:\
> these things have been understood\
> by Gotama the renowned.
>
> And so the Buddha, having insight,[^397]\
> explained this teaching to the mendicants.\
> The teacher made an end of suffering,\
> seeing clearly, he is fully quenched."[^398]

And while staying there, too, he often gave this Dhamma talk to the
mendicants:

"Such is ethics, such is immersion, such is wisdom. When immersion is
imbued with ethics it's very fruitful and beneficial. When wisdom is
imbued with immersion it's very fruitful and beneficial. When the mind
is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements, namely,
the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance."

## 22. The Four Great References

When the Buddha had stayed in Wares Village as long as he pleased, he
addressed Ānanda, "Come, Ānanda, let's go to Elephant Village."...[^399]

"Let's go to Mango Village."...[^400]

"Let's go to Black Plum Village."...[^401]

"Let's go to Bhoga City."[^402]

"Yes, sir," Ānanda replied. Then the Buddha together with a large
Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Bhoga City, where he stayed
at the Ānanda shrine.

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: "Mendicants, I will teach you
the four great references.[^403] Listen and apply your mind well, I will
speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Take a mendicant who says: 'Reverend, I have heard and learned this in
the presence of the Buddha:[^404] this is the teaching, this is the
training, this is the Teacher's instruction.'[^405] You should neither
approve nor dismiss that mendicant's statement.[^406] Instead, having
carefully memorized those words and phrases, you should make sure they
fit in the discourse and are exhibited in the training.[^407] If they do
not fit in the discourse and are not exhibited in the training, you
should draw the conclusion:[^408] 'Clearly this is not the word of the
Buddha. It has been incorrectly memorized by that mendicant.' And so you
should reject it. If they do fit in the discourse and are exhibited in
the training, you should draw the conclusion: 'Clearly this is the word
of the Buddha. It has been correctly memorized by that mendicant.' You
should remember it. This is the first great reference.[^409]

Take another mendicant who says: 'In such-and-such monastery lives a
Saṅgha with seniors and leaders.[^410] I've heard and
learned this in the presence of that Saṅgha: this is the
teaching, this is the training, this is the Teacher's instruction.' You
should neither approve nor dismiss that mendicant's statement. Instead,
having carefully memorized those words and phrases, you should make sure
they fit in the discourse and are exhibited in the training. If they do
not fit in the discourse and are not exhibited in the training, you
should draw the conclusion: 'Clearly this is not the word of the Buddha.
It has been incorrectly memorized by that Saṅgha.' And so
you should reject it. If they do fit in the discourse and are exhibited
in the training, you should draw the conclusion: 'Clearly this is the
word of the Buddha. It has been correctly memorized by that
Saṅgha.' You should remember it. This is the second great
reference.

Take another mendicant who says: 'In such-and-such monastery there are
several senior mendicants who are very learned, inheritors of the
heritage, who have memorized the teachings, the monastic law, and the
outlines.[^411] I've heard and learned this in the presence of those
senior mendicants: this is the teaching, this is the training, this is
the Teacher's instruction.' You should neither approve nor dismiss that
mendicant's statement. Instead, having carefully memorized those words
and phrases, you should make sure they fit in the discourse and are
exhibited in the training. If they do not fit in the discourse and are
not exhibited in the training, you should draw the conclusion: 'Clearly
this is not the word of the Buddha. It has not been correctly memorized
by those senior mendicants.' And so you should reject it. If they do fit
in the discourse and are exhibited in the training, you should draw the
conclusion: 'Clearly this is the word of the Buddha. It has been
correctly memorized by those senior mendicants.' You should remember it.
This is the third great reference.

Take another mendicant who says: 'In such-and-such monastery there is a
single senior mendicant who is very learned, an inheritor of the
heritage, who has memorized the teachings, the monastic law, and the
outlines.[^412] I've heard and learned this in the presence of that
senior mendicant: this is the teaching, this is the training, this is
the Teacher's instruction.' You should neither approve nor dismiss that
mendicant's statement. Instead, having carefully memorized those words
and phrases, you should make sure they fit in the discourse and are
exhibited in the training. If they do not fit in the discourse and are
not exhibited in the training, you should draw the conclusion: 'Clearly
this is not the word of the Buddha. It has been incorrectly memorized by
that senior mendicant.' And so you should reject it. If they do fit in
the discourse and are exhibited in the training, you should draw the
conclusion: 'Clearly this is the word of the Buddha. It has been
correctly memorized by that senior mendicant.' You should remember it.
This is the fourth great reference.

These are the four great references."[^413]

And while staying at the Ānanda shrine, too, the Buddha often gave this
Dhamma talk to the mendicants:

"Such is ethics, such is immersion, such is wisdom. When immersion is
imbued with ethics it's very fruitful and beneficial. When wisdom is
imbued with immersion it's very fruitful and beneficial. When the mind
is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements, namely,
the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance."

## 23. On Cunda the Smith

When the Buddha had stayed in Bhoga City as long as he pleased, he
addressed Ānanda, "Come, Ānanda, let's go to Pāvā."[^414]

"Yes, sir," Ānanda replied. Then the Buddha together with a large
Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Pāvā,[^415]
where he stayed in Cunda the smith's mango grove.[^416]

Cunda heard that the Buddha had arrived and was staying in his mango
grove. Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The
Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma
talk.[^417] Then Cunda said to the Buddha, "Sir, may the Buddha together
with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow's meal
from me." The Buddha consented with silence.

Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Cunda got up from his seat,
bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right,
before leaving.

And when the night had passed Cunda had delicious fresh and cooked foods
prepared in his own home, and plenty of pork on the turn. Then he had
the Buddha informed of the time, saying,[^418] "Sir, it's time. The meal
is ready."

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
went to the home of Cunda together with the mendicant
Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out and addressed
Cunda, "Cunda, please serve me with the pork on the turn that you've
prepared.[^419] And serve the mendicant Saṅgha with the
other foods."

"Yes, sir," replied Cunda, and did as he was asked.

Then the Buddha addressed Cunda, "Cunda, any pork on the turn that's
left over, you should bury it in a pit. I don't see anyone in this
world---with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this
population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans---who
could properly digest it except for the Realized One."

"Yes, sir," replied Cunda. He did as he was asked, then came back to the
Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Then the Buddha educated,
encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk, after which
he got up from his seat and left.

After the Buddha had eaten Cunda's meal, he fell severely ill with
bloody dysentery, struck by dreadful pains, close to death.[^420] But he
endured unbothered, with mindfulness and situational awareness. Then he
addressed Ānanda, "Come, Ānanda, let's go to Kusinārā."

"Yes, sir," Ānanda replied.

> I've heard that after eating[^421]\
> the meal of Cunda the smith,\
> the attentive one fell severely ill,\
> with pains, close to death.
>
> A severe sickness struck the Teacher\
> who had eaten the pork on the turn.\
> While still purging the Buddha said:\
> "I'll go to the citadel of Kusinārā."

## 24. Bringing a Drink

Then the Buddha left the road and went to the root of a certain tree,
where he addressed Ānanda, "Please, Ānanda, fold my outer robe in four
and spread it out for me. I am tired and will sit down."[^422]

"Yes, sir," replied Ānanda, and did as he was asked. The Buddha sat on
the seat spread out.

When he was seated he said to Venerable Ānanda, "Please, Ānanda, fetch
me some water. I am thirsty and will drink."[^423]

When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, "Sir, just now
around five hundred carts have passed by. The shallow water has been
churned up by their wheels, and it flows cloudy and murky. The
Kakutthā river is not far away, with clear, sweet, cool
water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful. There the Buddha can drink
and cool his limbs."[^424]

For a second time, the Buddha asked Ānanda for a drink, and for a second
time Ānanda suggested going to the Kakutthā river.

And for a third time, the Buddha said to Ānanda, "Please, Ānanda, fetch
me some water. I am thirsty and will drink."

"Yes, sir," replied Ānanda. Taking his bowl he went to the river.[^425]
Now, though the shallow water in that creek had been churned up by
wheels, and flowed cloudy and murky, when Ānanda approached it flowed
transparent, clear, and unclouded.

Then Ānanda thought, "Oh, how incredible, how amazing! The Realized One
has such psychic power and might! For though the shallow water in that
creek had been churned up by wheels, and flowed cloudy and murky, when I
approached it flowed transparent, clear, and unclouded." Gathering a
bowl of drinking water he went back to the Buddha, and said to him,
"It's incredible, sir, it's amazing! The Realized One has such psychic
power and might! Just now, though the shallow water in that creek had
been churned up by wheels, and flowed cloudy and murky, when I
approached it flowed transparent, clear, and unclouded. Drink the water,
Blessed One! Drink the water, Holy One!" So the Buddha drank the water.

## 25. On Pukkusa the Malla

Now at that time Pukkusa the Malla, a disciple of Āḷāra
Kālāma, was traveling along the road from
Kusinārā to Pāvā.[^426] He saw the Buddha
sitting at the root of a certain tree. He went up to him, bowed, sat
down to one side, and said, "It's incredible, sir, it's amazing! Those
who have gone forth remain in such peaceful meditations.

Once it so happened that Āḷāra Kālāma, while
traveling along a road, left the road and sat at the root of a nearby
tree for the day's meditation. Then around five hundred carts passed by
right beside Āḷāra Kālāma.[^427] Then a
certain person coming behind those carts went up to Āḷāra
Kālāma and said to him: 'Sir, didn't you see the five
hundred carts pass by?'[^428]

'No, friend, I didn't see them.'

'But sir, didn't you hear a sound?'

'No, friend, I didn't hear a sound.'

'But sir, were you asleep?'

'No, friend, I wasn't asleep.'

'But sir, were you conscious?'

'Yes, friend.' 'So, sir, while conscious and awake you neither saw nor
heard a sound as five hundred carts passed by right beside you? Why sir,
even your outer robe is covered with dust!'[^429]

'Yes, friend.'

Then that person thought: 'Oh, how incredible, how amazing! Those who
have gone forth remain in such peaceful meditations, in that, while
conscious and awake he neither saw nor heard a sound as five hundred
carts passed by right next to him.' And after declaring his lofty
confidence in Āḷāra Kālāma, he left."

"What do you think, Pukkusa? Which is harder and more challenging to do
while conscious and awake: to neither see nor hear a sound as five
hundred carts pass by right next to you? Or to neither see nor hear a
sound as the heavens are raining and pouring, lightning's flashing, and
thunder's cracking?"

"What do five hundred carts matter, or six hundred, or seven hundred, or
eight hundred, or nine hundred, or a thousand, or even a hundred
thousand carts? It's far harder and more challenging to neither see nor
hear a sound as the heavens are raining and pouring, lightning's
flashing, and thunder's cracking!"

"This one time, Pukkusa, I was staying near Ātumā in a
threshing-hut.[^430] At that time the heavens were raining and pouring,
lightning was flashing, and thunder was cracking. And not far from the
threshing-hut two farmers who were brothers were killed, as well as four
oxen. Then a large crowd came from Ātumā to the place where
that happened.

Now at that time I came out of the threshing-hut and was walking
mindfully in the open near the door of the hut. Then having left that
crowd, a certain person approached me, bowed, and stood to one side. I
said to them, 'Why, friend, has this crowd gathered?'

'Just now, sir, the heavens were raining and pouring, lightning was
flashing, and thunder was cracking. And two farmers who were brothers
were killed, as well as four oxen. Then this crowd gathered here. But
sir, where were you?'

'I was right here, friend.'

'But sir, did you see?'

'No, friend, I didn't see anything.'

'But sir, didn't you hear a sound?'

'No, friend, I didn't hear a sound.'

'But sir, were you asleep?'

'No, friend, I wasn't asleep.'

'But sir, were you conscious?'

'Yes, friend.'

'So, sir, while conscious and awake you neither saw nor heard a sound as
the heavens were raining and pouring, lightning was flashing, and
thunder was cracking?'

'Yes, friend.'

Then that person thought: 'Oh, how incredible, how amazing! Those who
have gone forth remain in such peaceful meditations, in that, while
conscious and awake he neither saw nor heard a sound as the heavens were
raining and pouring, lightning was flashing, and thunder was cracking.'
And after declaring their lofty confidence in me, they bowed and
respectfully circled me, keeping me on their right, before leaving."

When he said this, Pukkusa said to him, "Any confidence I had in
Āḷāra Kālāma I sweep away as in a strong wind,
or float away as down a swift stream. Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if
he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing
out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with
clear eyes can see what's there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear
in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the
mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the Buddha
remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."

Then Pukkusa addressed a certain man, "Please, my man, fetch a pair of
ready to wear garments the color of mountain gold."[^431]

"Yes, sir," replied that man, and did as he was asked. Then Pukkusa
brought the garments to the Buddha, "Sir, please accept this pair of
ready to wear garments the color of mountain gold from me out of
sympathy."

"Well then, Pukkusa, clothe me in one, and Ānanda in the other."

"Yes, sir," replied Pukkusa, and did so.

Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Pukkusa the
Malla with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat, bowed,
and respectfully circled the Buddha before leaving.

Then, not long after Pukkusa had left, Ānanda placed the pair of
garments the color of mountain gold by the Buddha's body. But when
placed by the Buddha's body they seemed to lose their shine. Then Ānanda
said to the Buddha, "It's incredible, sir, it's amazing, how pure and
bright is the color of the Realized One's skin. When this pair of ready
to wear garments the color of mountain gold is placed by the Buddha's
body they seem to lose their lustre."

"That's so true, Ānanda, that's so true! There are two times when the
color of the Realized One's skin becomes extra pure and bright. What
two? The night when a Realized One understands the supreme perfect
awakening; and the night he becomes fully extinguished in the element of
extinguishment with no residue.[^432] These are the are two times when
the color of the Realized One's skin becomes extra pure and bright.

Today, Ānanda, in the last watch of the night, between a pair of sal
trees in the sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near
Kusinārā, shall be the Realized One's full extinguishment.
Come, Ānanda, let's go to the Kakutthā River."

"Yes, sir," Ānanda replied.

> A pair of garments the color of mountain gold[^433]\
> was presented by Pukkusa;\
> when the teacher was clothed with them,\
> his snow gold skin glowed bright.

Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants
went to the Kakutthā River. He plunged into the river and
bathed and drank. And when he had emerged, he went to the mango grove,
where he addressed Venerable Cundaka,[^434] "Please, Cundaka, fold my
outer robe in four and spread it out for me. I am tired and will lie
down."

"Yes, sir," replied Cundaka, and did as he was asked. And then the
Buddha laid down in the lion's posture---on the right side, placing one
foot on top of the other---mindful and aware, and focused on the time of
getting up. But Cundaka sat down right there in front of the Buddha.

> Having gone to Kakutthā Creek,[^435]\
> whose water was transparent, sweet, and clear,\
> the Teacher, being tired, plunged in,\
> the Realized One, without compare in the world.
>
> And after bathing and drinking the Teacher emerged.\
> Before the group of mendicants, in the middle,\
> \>the Buddha,\
> the Teacher\
> \>who rolled forth the present dispensation,[^436]\
> the great seer went to the mango grove.
>
> He addressed the mendicant named Cundaka:\
> "Spread out my folded robe so I can lie down."\
> The evolved one urged Cunda,\
> who quickly spread the folded robe.\
> The Teacher lay down so tired,\
> while Cunda sat there before him.

Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda:

"Now it may happen, Ānanda, that someone may give rise to regret in
Cunda the smith: 'It's your loss, respected Cunda, it's your misfortune,
in that the Realized One was fully quenched after eating his last
almsmeal from you.'[^437] You should dispel remorse in Cunda the smith
like this: 'You're fortunate, respected Cunda, you're so very fortunate,
in that the Realized One was fully quenched after eating his last
almsmeal from you. I have heard and learned this in the presence of the
Buddha.

There are two almsmeal offerings that have identical fruit and result,
and are more fruitful and beneficial than other almsmeal
offerings.[^438] What two? The almsmeal after eating which a Realized
One understands the supreme perfect awakening; and the almsmeal after
eating which he becomes fully extinguished in the element of
extinguishment with no residue. These two almsmeal offerings have
identical fruit and result, and are more fruitful and beneficial than
other almsmeal offerings.

You've accumulated a deed that leads to long life, beauty, happiness,
fame, heaven, and sovereignty.'[^439] That's how you should dispel
remorse in Cunda the smith."

Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed
this heartfelt sentiment:

> "A giver's merit grows;[^440]\
> enmity doesn't build up when you have self-control.\
> A skillful person gives up bad things---\
> with the end of greed, hate, and delusion,\
> \>they're quenched."

_*The fourth recitation section.*_

## 26. The Pair of Sal Trees

Then the Buddha said to Ānanda, "Come, Ānanda, let's go to the far shore
of the Golden River, and on to the sal forest of the Mallas at
Upavattana near Kusinārā."[^441]

"Yes, sir," Ānanda replied. And that's where they went. Then the Buddha
addressed Ānanda, "Please, Ānanda, set up a cot for me between the twin
sal trees, with my head to the north. I am tired and will lie down."

"Yes, sir," replied Ānanda, and did as he was asked. And then the Buddha
laid down in the lion's posture---on the right side, placing one foot on
top of the other---mindful and aware.[^442]

Now at that time the twin sal trees were in full blossom with flowers
out of season.[^443] They sprinkled and bestrewed the Realized One's
body in honor of the Realized One. And the flowers of the heavenly Flame
Tree fell from the sky, and they too sprinkled and bestrewed the
Realized One's body in honor of the Realized One. And heavenly
sandalwood powder fell from the sky, and it too sprinkled and bestrewed
the Realized One's body in honor of the Realized One. And heavenly music
played in midair in honor of the Realized One. And heavenly choirs sang
in midair in honor of the Realized One.

Then the Buddha pointed out to Ānanda what was happening, adding:
"That's not the full extent of how the Realized One is honored,
respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. Any monk or nun or male or
female lay follower who practices in line with the teachings, practicing
properly, living in line with the teachings---they honor, respect,
revere, venerate, and esteem the Realized One with the highest
honor.[^444] So Ānanda, you should train like this: 'We shall practice
in line with the teachings, practicing properly, living in line with the
teaching.'"[^445]

## 27. The Monk Upavāna

Now at that time Venerable Upavāna was standing in front of
the Buddha fanning him.[^446] Then the Buddha made him move, "Move over,
mendicant, don't stand in front of me."

Ānanda thought, "This Venerable Upavāna has been the
Buddha's attendant for a long time, close to him, living in his
presence.[^447] Yet in his final hour the Buddha makes him move, saying:
'Move over, mendicant, don't stand in front of me.' What is the cause,
what is the reason for this?"

Then Ānanda said to the Buddha, "This Venerable Upavāna has
been the Buddha's attendant for a long time, close to him, living in his
presence. Yet in his final hour the Buddha makes him move, saying: 'Move
over, mendicant, don't stand in front of me.' What is the cause, sir,
what is the reason for this?"

"Most of the deities from ten solar systems have gathered to see the
Realized One. For twelve leagues all around this sal grove there's no
spot, not even a fraction of a hair's tip, that's not crowded full of
illustrious deities.[^448] The deities are complaining: 'We've come such
a long way to see the Realized One! Only rarely do Realized Ones arise
in the world, perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas. This very day, in
the last watch of the night, the Realized One will be fully
extinguished. And this illustrious mendicant is standing in front of the
Buddha blocking the view. We won't get to see the Realized One in his
final hour!'"

"But sir, what kind of deities are you thinking of?"

"There are, Ānanda, deities---both in space and on the earth---who are
aware of the earth. With hair disheveled and arms raised, they fall down
like their feet were chopped off, rolling back and forth,
lamenting:[^449] 'Too soon the Blessed One will be fully extinguished!
Too soon the Holy One will be fully extinguished! Too soon the Eye of
the World will vanish!'[^450]

But the deities who are free of desire endure, mindful and aware,
thinking: 'Conditions are impermanent. How could it possibly be
otherwise?'"[^451]

## 28. The Four Inspiring Places

"Previously, sir, when mendicants had completed the rainy season
residence in various districts they came to see the Realized One.[^452]
We got to see the esteemed mendicants, and to pay homage to them.[^453]
But when the Buddha has passed, we won't get to see the esteemed
mendicants or to pay homage to them."

"Ānanda, a faithful gentleman should go to see these four inspiring
places.[^454] What four? Thinking: 'Here the Realized One was
born!'---that is an inspiring place.[^455] Thinking: 'Here the Realized
One became awakened as a supreme fully awakened Buddha!'---that is an
inspiring place.[^456] Thinking: 'Here the supreme Wheel of Dhamma was
rolled forth by the Realized One!'---that is an inspiring place.[^457]
Thinking: 'Here the Realized One was fully quenched in the element of
extinguishment with no residue!'---that is an inspiring place.[^458]
These are the four inspiring places that a faithful gentleman should go
to see.

Faithful monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen will come, and think: 'Here
the Realized One was born!' and 'Here the Realized One became awakened
as a supreme fully awakened Buddha!' and 'Here the supreme Wheel of
Dhamma was rolled forth by the Realized One!' and 'Here the Realized One
was fully quenched in the element of extinguishment with no residue!'
Anyone who passes away while on pilgrimage to these shrines will, when
their body breaks up, after death, be reborn in a good place, a heavenly
realm."

## 29. Ānanda's Questions

"Sir, how do we proceed when it comes to females?"[^459]

"Without looking, Ānanda."[^460]

"But when looking, how to proceed?"[^461]

"Without chatting, Ānanda."[^462]

"But when chatting, how to proceed?"[^463]

"Be mindful, Ānanda."[^464]

"Sir, how do we proceed when it comes to the Realized One's
corpse?"[^465]

"Don't get involved in the rites for venerating the Realized One's
corpse, Ānanda.[^466] Please, Ānanda, you must all strive and practice
for your own goal! Meditate diligent, keen, and resolute for your own
goal![^467] There are astute aristocrats, brahmins, and householders who
are devoted to the Realized One. They will perform the rites for
venerating the Realized One's corpse."

"But sir, how to proceed when it comes to the Realized One's corpse?"

"Proceed in the same way as they do for the corpse of a wheel-turning
monarch."

"But how do they proceed with a wheel-turning monarch's corpse?"

"They wrap a wheel-turning monarch's corpse with unworn cloth, then with
uncarded cotton, then again with unworn cloth. In this way they wrap the
corpse with five hundred double-layers. Then they place it in an iron
case filled with oil and close it up with another case. Then, having
built a funeral pyre out of all kinds of aromatics, they cremate the
corpse.[^468] They build a monument for the wheel-turning monarch at the
crossroads.[^469] That's how they proceed with a wheel-turning monarch's
corpse. Proceed in the same way with the Realized One's corpse.[^470] A
monument for the Realized One is to be built at the crossroads. When
someone there lifts up garlands or fragrance or powder, or bows, or
inspires confidence in their heart, that will be for their lasting
welfare and happiness.

## 30. Persons Worthy of Monument

Ānanda, these four are worthy of a monument. What four? A Realized One,
a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha; an independent Buddha; a
disciple of a Realized One; and a wheel-turning monarch.

And for what reason is a Realized One worthy of a monument? So that many
people will inspire confidence in their hearts, thinking: 'This is the
monument for that Blessed One, perfected and fully awakened!' And having
done so, when their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a
good place, a heavenly realm. It is for this reason that a Realized One
is worthy of a monument.

And for what reason is an independent Buddha worthy of a monument?[^471]
So that many people will inspire confidence in their hearts, thinking:
'This is the monument for that independent Buddha!' And having done so,
when their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a good place,
a heavenly realm. It is for this reason that an independent Buddha is
worthy of a monument.

And for what reason is a Realized One's disciple worthy of a
monument?[^472] So that many people will inspire confidence in their
hearts, thinking: 'This is the monument for that Blessed One's
disciple!' And having done so, when their body breaks up, after death,
they are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. It is for this reason
that a Realized One's disciple is worthy of a monument.

And for what reason is a wheel-turning monarch worthy of a monument? So
that many people will inspire confidence in their hearts, thinking:
'This is the monument for that just and principled king!'[^473] And
having done so, when their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn
in a good place, a heavenly realm. It is for this reason that a
wheel-turning monarch is worthy of a monument.

These four are worthy of a monument."

## 31. Ānanda's Incredible Qualities

Then Venerable Ānanda entered a building, and stood there leaning
against the door-jamb and crying,[^474] "Oh! I'm still only a trainee
with work left to do; and my Teacher is about to be fully extinguished,
he who is so kind to me!"[^475]

Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, "Mendicants, where is Ānanda?"

"Sir, Ānanda has entered a dwelling, and stands there leaning against
the door-jamb and crying: 'Oh! I'm still only a trainee with work left
to do; and my Teacher is about to be fully extinguished, he who is so
kind to me!'"

So the Buddha addressed one of the monks, "Please, monk, in my name tell
Ānanda that the teacher summons him."

"Yes, sir," that monk replied. He went to Ānanda and said to him,
"Reverend Ānanda, the teacher summons you."

"Yes, reverend," Ānanda replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat
down to one side. The Buddha said to him:

"Enough, Ānanda! Do not grieve, do not lament. Did I not prepare for
this when I explained that[^476] we must be parted and separated from
all we hold dear and beloved? How could it possibly be so that what is
born, created, conditioned, and liable to wear out should not wear out,
even the Realized One's body? For a long time, Ānanda, you've treated
the Realized One with deeds of body, speech, and mind that are loving,
beneficial, pleasant, undivided, and limitless.[^477] You have done good
deeds, Ānanda. Devote yourself to meditation, and you will soon be free
of defilements."[^478]

Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:

"The Buddhas of the past or the future have attendants who are no better
than Ānanda is for me.[^479] Ānanda is astute, he is intelligent. He
knows the time for monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, king's ministers,
monastics of other religions and their disciples to visit the Realized
One.[^480]

There are these four incredible and amazing things about Ānanda.[^481]
What four? If an assembly of monks goes to see Ānanda, they're uplifted
by seeing him and uplifted by hearing him speak. And when he falls
silent, they've never had enough. If an assembly of nuns ... laymen ...
or laywomen goes to see Ānanda, they're uplifted by seeing him and
uplifted by hearing him speak. And when he falls silent, they've never
had enough. These are the four incredible and amazing things about
Ānanda.

There are these four incredible and amazing things about a wheel-turning
monarch.[^482] What four? If an assembly of aristocrats goes to see a
wheel-turning monarch, they're uplifted by seeing him and uplifted by
hearing him speak. And when he falls silent, they've never had enough.
If an assembly of brahmins ... householders ... or ascetics goes to see
a wheel-turning monarch, they're uplifted by seeing him and uplifted by
hearing him speak. And when he falls silent, they've never had enough.

In the same way, there are those four incredible and amazing things
about Ānanda."

## 32. Teaching the Discourse on Mahāsudassana

When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha:

"Sir, please don't be fully extinguished in this little hamlet, this
jungle hamlet, this branch hamlet. There are other great cities such as
Campā, Rājagaha, Sāvatthī,
Sāketa, Kosambī, and Varanasi.[^483] Let the
Buddha be fully extinguished there. There are many well-to-do
aristocrats, brahmins, and householders there who are devoted to the
Buddha. They will perform the rites of venerating the Realized One's
corpse."

"Don't say that Ānanda! Don't say that this is a little hamlet, a jungle
hamlet, a branch hamlet.

Once upon a time there was a king named Mahāsudassana who
was a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion
extended to all four sides, he achieved stability in the country, and he
possessed the seven treasures.[^484] His capital was this
Kusinārā, which at the time was named
Kusāvatī.[^485] It stretched for twelve leagues from east
to west, and seven leagues from north to south.[^486] The royal capital
of Kusāvatī was successful, prosperous, populous, full of
people, with plenty of food. It was just like Āḷakamandā,
the royal capital of the gods, which is successful, prosperous,
populous, full of spirits, with plenty of food.[^487]
Kusāvatī was never free of ten sounds by day or night,
namely: the sound of elephants, horses, chariots, drums, clay drums,
arched harps, singing, horns, gongs, and handbells; and the cry: 'Eat,
drink, be merry!' as the tenth.

Go, Ānanda, into Kusinārā and inform the Mallas: 'This very
day, Vāseṭṭhas, in the last watch of the night, the
Realized One will be fully extinguished.[^488] Come forth,
Vāseṭṭhas! Come forth, Vāseṭṭhas! Don't regret
it later, thinking: 'The Realized One became fully extinguished in our
own village district, but we didn't get a chance to see him in his final
hour.'"

"Yes, sir," replied Ānanda. Then he robed up and, taking his bowl and
robe, entered Kusinārā with a companion.[^489]

## 33. The Mallas Pay Homage

Now at that time the Mallas of Kusinārā were sitting
together at the town hall on some business.[^490] Ānanda went up to
them, and announced: "This very day, Vāseṭṭhas, in the last
watch of the night, the Realized One will be fully extinguished. Come
forth, Vāseṭṭhas! Come forth, Vāseṭṭhas! Don't
regret it later, thinking: 'The Realized One became fully extinguished
in our own village district, but we didn't get a chance to see him in
his final hour.'"

When they heard what Ānanda had to say, the Mallas, their sons,
daughters-in-law, and wives became distraught, saddened, and
grief-stricken. And some, with hair disheveled and arms raised, falling
down like their feet were chopped off, rolling back and forth, lamented,
"Too soon the Blessed One will be fully extinguished! Too soon the Holy
One will be fully extinguished! Too soon the Eye of the World will
vanish!"

Then the Mallas, their sons, daughters-in-law, and wives, distraught,
saddened, and grief-stricken went to the Mallian sal grove at Upavattana
and approached Ānanda.

Then Ānanda thought, "If I have the Mallas pay homage to the Buddha one
by one, they won't be finished before first light. I'd better separate
them family by family and then have them pay homage, saying: 'Sir, the
Malla named so-and-so with children, wives, retinue, and ministers bows
with his head at your feet.'" And so that's what he did. So by this
means Ānanda got the Mallas to finish paying homage to the Buddha in the
first watch of the night.

## 34. On Subhadda the Wanderer

Now at that time a wanderer named Subhadda was residing near
Kusinārā.[^491] He heard that on that very day, in the last
watch of the night, will be the full extinguishment of the ascetic
Gotama. He thought: "I have heard that brahmins of the past who were
elderly and senior, the tutors of tutors, said: 'Only rarely do Realized
Ones arise in the world, perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas.' And
this very day, in the last watch of the night, will be the full
extinguishment of the ascetic Gotama. This state of uncertainty has come
up in me. I am quite confident that the Buddha is capable of teaching me
so that I can give up this state of uncertainty."

Then Subhadda went to the Mallian sal grove at Upavattana, approached
Ānanda, and said to him, "Master Ānanda, I have heard that brahmins of
the past who were elderly and senior, the tutors of tutors, said: 'Only
rarely do Realized Ones arise in the world, perfected ones, fully
awakened Buddhas.' And this very day, in the last watch of the night,
will be the full extinguishment of the ascetic Gotama. This state of
uncertainty has come up in me. I am quite confident that the Buddha is
capable of teaching me so that I can give up this state of uncertainty.
Mister Ānanda, please let me see the ascetic Gotama."

When he had spoken, Ānanda said, "Enough, Reverend Subhadda, do not
trouble the Realized One. He is tired."

For a second time, and a third time, Subhadda asked Ānanda, and a third
time Ānanda refused.

The Buddha heard that discussion between Ānanda and Subhadda. He said to
Ānanda, "Enough, Ānanda, don't obstruct Subhadda; let him see the
Realized One. For whatever he asks me, he will only be looking to
understand, not to trouble me. And he will quickly understand any answer
I give to his question."

So Ānanda said to the wanderer Subhadda, "Go, Reverend Subhadda, the
Buddha is making time for you."

Then the wanderer Subhadda went up to the Buddha, and exchanged
greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were
over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:

"Mister Gotama, there are those ascetics and brahmins who lead an order
and a community, and tutor a community. They're well-known and famous
religious founders, deemed holy by many people. Namely:
Pūraṇa Kassapa, the bamboo-staffed ascetic
Gosāla, Ajita of the hair blanket, Pakudha
Kaccāyana, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta,
and the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan. According to their
own claims, did all of them have direct knowledge, or none of them, or
only some?"[^492]

"Enough, Subhadda, let that be.[^493] I shall teach you the Dhamma.
Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," Subhadda replied. The Buddha said this:

"Subhadda, in whatever teaching and training the noble eightfold path is
not found, there is no ascetic found, no second ascetic, no third
ascetic, and no fourth ascetic.[^494] In whatever teaching and training
the noble eightfold path is found, there is an ascetic found, a second
ascetic, a third ascetic, and a fourth ascetic.[^495] In this teaching
and training the noble eightfold path is found. Only here is there an
ascetic, here a second ascetic, here a third ascetic, and here a fourth
ascetic. Other sects are empty of ascetics.

Were these mendicants to practice well, the world would not be empty of
perfected ones.[^496]

> I was twenty-nine years of age, Subhadda,[^497]\
> when I went forth to discover what is skillful.[^498]\
> It's been over fifty years\
> since I went forth.\
> Teacher of the references\
> \>for the systematic teaching:[^499]\
> outside of here there is no ascetic,

no second ascetic, no third ascetic, and no fourth ascetic. Other sects
are empty of ascetics. Were these mendicants to practice well, the world
would not be empty of perfected ones."

When he had spoken, Subhadda said to the Buddha, "Excellent, sir!
Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the
hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the
dark so people with clear eyes can see what's there, the Buddha has made
the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the
teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. Sir, may I receive
the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha's presence?"

"Subhadda, if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take
the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training, they must
spend four months on probation. When four months have passed, if the
mendicants are satisfied, they'll give the going forth, the ordination
into monkhood. However, I have recognized individual differences in this
matter."

"Sir, if four months probation are required in such a case, I'll spend
four years on probation. When four years have passed, if the mendicants
are satisfied, let them give me the going forth, the ordination into
monkhood."

Then the Buddha said to Ānanda, "Well then, Ānanda, give Subhadda the
going forth."

"Yes, sir," Ānanda replied.

Then Subhadda said to Ānanda, "You're so fortunate, Reverand Ānanda, so
very fortunate, to be anointed here in the Teacher's presence as his
pupil!" And the wanderer Subhadda received the going forth, the
ordination in the Buddha's presence. Not long after his ordination,
Venerable Subhadda, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and
resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this
very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for
which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.

He understood: "Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been
completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further
for this place." And Venerable Subhadda became one of the perfected. He
was the last personal disciple of the Buddha.[^500]

_*The fifth recitation section.*_

## 35. The Buddha's Last Words

Then the Buddha addressed Venerable Ānanda:

"Now, Ānanda, some of you might think: 'The teacher's dispensation has
passed. Now we have no Teacher.' But you should not see it like this.
The teaching and training that I have taught and pointed out for you
shall be your Teacher after my passing.[^501]

After my passing, mendicants ought not address each other as 'reverend',
as they do today.[^502] A more senior mendicant ought to address a more
junior mendicant by name or clan, or by saying 'reverend'. A more junior
mendicant ought to address a more senior mendicant using 'sir' or
'venerable'.[^503]

If it wishes, after my passing the Saṅgha may abolish the
lesser and minor training rules.[^504]

After my passing, give the divine punishment to the mendicant
Channa."[^505]

"But sir, what is the divine punishment?"

"Channa may say what he likes, but the mendicants should not correct,
advise, or instruct him."[^506]

Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, "Perhaps even a single mendicant
has doubt or uncertainty regarding the Buddha, the teaching, the
Saṅgha, the path, or the practice. So ask, mendicants!
Don't regret it later, thinking: 'We were in the Teacher's presence and
we weren't able to ask the Buddha a question.'"

When this was said, the mendicants kept silent.

For a second time, and a third time the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
"Perhaps even a single mendicant has doubt or uncertainty regarding the
Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the path, or the
practice. So ask, mendicants! Don't regret it later, thinking: 'We were
in the Teacher's presence and we weren't able to ask the Buddha a
question.'"

For a third time, the mendicants kept silent. Then the Buddha said to
the mendicants,

"Mendicants, perhaps you don't ask out of respect for the Teacher. So
let a friend tell a friend."

When this was said, the mendicants kept silent.

Then Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, "It's incredible, sir, it's
amazing! I am quite confident that there is not even a single mendicant
in this Saṅgha who has doubt or uncertainty regarding the
Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the path, or the
practice."

"Ānanda, you speak out of faith. But the Realized One knows that there
is not even a single mendicant in this Saṅgha who has doubt
or uncertainty regarding the Buddha, the teaching, the
Saṅgha, the path, or the practice. Even the last of these
five hundred mendicants is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in
the underworld, bound for awakening."

Then the Buddha said to the mendicants: "Come now, mendicants, I say to
you all: 'Conditions fall apart. Persist with diligence.'"

These were the Realized One's last words.[^507]

## 36. Fully Quenched

Then the Buddha entered the first absorption. Emerging from that, he
entered the second absorption. Emerging from that, he successively
entered into and emerged from the third absorption, the fourth
absorption, the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite
consciousness, the dimension of nothingness, and the dimension of
neither perception nor non-perception. Then he entered the cessation of
perception and feeling.[^508]

Then Venerable Ānanda said to Venerable Anuruddha, "Honorable Anuruddha,
has the Buddha become fully quenched?"[^509]

"No, Reverend Ānanda. He has entered the cessation of perception and
feeling."

Then the Buddha emerged from the cessation of perception and feeling and
entered the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Emerging
from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the dimension
of nothingness, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension
of infinite space, the fourth absorption, the third absorption, the
second absorption, and the first absorption. Emerging from that, he
successively entered into and emerged from the second absorption and the
third absorption. Then he entered the fourth absorption. Emerging from
that the Buddha immediately became fully extinguished.

When the Buddha was fully quenched, along with the full extinguishment
there was a great earthquake, awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and
thunder cracked the sky. When the Buddha was fully quenched, the
divinity Sahampati recited this verse:

> "All creatures in this world[^510]\
> must lay down this bag of bones.[^511]\
> For even a Teacher such as this,\
> unrivaled in the world,\
> the Realized One, attained to power,\
> the Buddha was fully quenched."

When the Buddha was fully quenched, Sakka, lord of gods, recited this
verse:

> "Oh! Conditions are impermanent,[^512]\
> their nature is to rise and fall;\
> having arisen, they cease;\
> their stilling is blissful."

When the Buddha was fully quenched, Venerable Anuruddha recited this
verse:

> "There was no more breathing[^513]\
> for the unaffected one of steady heart.\
> Imperturbable, committed to peace,\
> the sage has done his time.
>
> He put up with painful feelings\
> without flinching.\
> The liberation of his heart\
> was like the extinguishing of a lamp."

When the Buddha was fully quenched, Venerable Ānanda recited this verse:

> "Then there was terror![^514]\
> Then they had goosebumps!\
> When the Buddha, endowed with all fine qualities,\
> became fully quenched."

When the Buddha was fully quenched, some of the mendicants there who
were not free of desire, with arms raised, falling down like their feet
were chopped off, rolling back and forth, lamented: "Too soon the
Blessed One has become fully quenched! Too soon the Holy One has become
fully quenched! Too soon the Eye of the World has vanished!"[^515] But
the mendicants who were free of desire endured, mindful and aware,
thinking, "Conditions are impermanent. How could it possibly be
otherwise?"

Then Anuruddha addressed the mendicants: "Enough, reverends, do not
grieve or lament. Did the Buddha not prepare us for this when he
explained that we must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and
beloved? How could it possibly be so that what is born, created,
conditioned, and liable to wear out should not wear out? The deities are
complaining."

"But sir, what kind of deities are you thinking of?"

"There are, Ānanda, deities---both in space and on the earth---who are
aware of the earth. With hair disheveled and arms raised, they fall down
like their feet were chopped off, rolling back and forth, lamenting:
'Too soon the Blessed One has become fully quenched! Too soon the Holy
One has become fully quenched! Too soon the Eye of the World has
vanished!' But the deities who are free of desire endure, mindful and
aware, thinking: 'Conditions are impermanent. How could it possibly be
otherwise?'"

Ānanda and Anuruddha spent the rest of the night talking about Dhamma.

Then Anuruddha said to Ānanda, "Go, Ānanda, into Kusinārā
and inform the Mallas: 'Vāseṭṭhas, the Buddha has become
fully quenched. Please come at your convenience.'"

"Yes, sir," replied Ānanda. Then, in the morning, he robed up and,
taking his bowl and robe, entered Kusinārā with a
companion.

Now at that time the Mallas of Kusinārā were sitting
together at the town hall still on the same business.[^516] Ānanda went
up to them, and announced, "Vāseṭṭhas, the Buddha has
become fully quenched. Please come at your convenience."

When they heard what Ānanda had to say, the Mallas, their sons,
daughters-in-law, and wives became distraught, saddened, and
grief-stricken. And some, with hair disheveled and arms raised, falling
down like their feet were chopped off, rolling back and forth, lamented,
"Too soon the Blessed One has become fully quenched! Too soon the Holy
One has become fully quenched! Too soon the Eye of the World has
vanished!"

## 37. The Rites of Venerating the Buddha's Corpse

Then the Mallas ordered their men, "So then, my men, collect fragrances
and garlands, and all the musical instruments in Kusinārā."

Then---taking those fragrances and garlands, all the musical
instruments, and five hundred pairs of garments---they went to the
Mallian sal grove at Upavattana and approached the Buddha's corpse. They
spent the day honoring, respecting, revering, and venerating the
Buddha's corpse with dance and song and music and garlands and
fragrances, and making awnings and setting up pavilions.[^517]

Then they thought, "It's too late to cremate the Buddha's corpse today.
Let's do it tomorrow." But they spent the next day the same way, and so
too the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth days.[^518]

Then on the seventh day they thought, "Honoring, respecting, revering,
and venerating the Buddha's corpse with dance and song and music and
garlands and fragrances, let us carry it to the south of the town, and
cremate it there outside the town."

Now at that time eight of the leading Mallas, having bathed their heads
and dressed in unworn clothes, said,[^519] "We shall lift the Buddha's
corpse." But they were unable to do so.

The Mallas said to Anuruddha, "What is the cause, Honorable Anuruddha,
what is the reason why these eight Mallian chiefs are unable to lift the
Buddha's corpse?"

"Vāseṭṭhas, you have one plan, but the deities have a
different one."

"But sir, what is the deities' plan?"

"You plan to carry the Buddha's corpse to the south of the town while
venerating it with dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances,
and cremate it there outside the town. The deities plan to carry the
Buddha's corpse to the north of the town while venerating it with
heavenly dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances. Then they
plan to enter the town by the northern gate, carry it through the center
of the town, leave by the eastern gate, and cremate it there at the
Mallian shrine named Coronation."[^520]

"Sir, let it be as the deities plan."

Now at that time the whole of Kusinārā was covered
knee-deep with the flowers of the Flame Tree, without gaps even on the
filth and rubbish heaps.[^521] Then the deities and the Mallas of
Kusinārā carried the Buddha's corpse to the north of the
town while venerating it with heavenly and human dance and song and
music and garlands and fragrances. Then they entered the town by the
northern gate, carried it through the center of the town, left by the
eastern gate, and deposited the corpse there at the Mallian shrine named
Coronation.

Then the Mallas said to Ānanda, "Honorable Ānanda, how do we proceed
when it comes to the Realized One's corpse?"

"Proceed in the same way as they do for the corpse of a wheel-turning
monarch."

"But how do they proceed with a wheel-turning monarch's corpse?"

"They wrap a wheel-turning monarch's corpse with unworn cloth, then with
uncarded cotton, then again with unworn cloth. In this way they wrap the
corpse with five hundred double-layers. Then they place it in an iron
case filled with oil and close it up with another case. Then, having
built a funeral pyre out of all kinds of aromatics, they cremate the
corpse. They build a monument for the wheel-turning monarch at the
crossroads. That's how they proceed with a wheel-turning monarch's
corpse. Proceed in the same way with the Realized One's corpse. A
monument for the Realized One is to be built at the crossroads. When
someone there lifts up garlands or fragrance or powder, or bows, or
inspires confidence in their heart, that will be for their lasting
welfare and happiness."

Then the Mallas ordered their men, "So then, my men, collect uncarded
cotton."

So the Mallas wrapped the Buddha's corpse, and placed it in an iron case
filled with oil. Then, having built a funeral pyre out of all kinds of
aromatics, they lifted the corpse on to the pyre.

## 38. Mahākassapa's Arrival

Now at that time Venerable Mahākassapa was traveling along
the road from Pāvā to Kusinārā together with a
large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants.[^522] Then he left
the road and sat at the root of a tree.

Now at that time a certain Ājīvaka ascetic had picked up a
Flame Tree flower in Kusinārā and was traveling along the
road to Pāvā.[^523] Mahākassapa saw him coming
off in the distance and said to him, "Reverend, might you know about our
Teacher?"

"Yes, reverend. Seven days ago the ascetic Gotama was fully quenched.
From there I picked up this Flame Tree flower." Some of the mendicants
there who were not free of desire, with arms raised, falling down like
their feet were chopped off, rolling back and forth, lamented, "Too soon
the Blessed One has become fully quenched! Too soon the Holy One has
become fully quenched! Too soon the Eye of the World has vanished!" But
the mendicants who were free of desire endured, mindful and aware,
thinking, "Conditions are impermanent. How could it possibly be
otherwise?"

Now at that time a monk named Subhadda, who had gone forth when old, was
sitting in that assembly. He said to those mendicants, "Enough,
reverends, do not grieve or lament. We're well rid of that Great
Ascetic. And we are oppressed:[^524] 'This is allowable for you; this is
not allowable for you.' Well, now we shall do what we want and not do
what we don't want."

Then Venerable Mahākassapa addressed the mendicants,
"Enough, reverends, do not grieve or lament. Did the Buddha not prepare
us for this when he explained that we must be parted and separated from
all we hold dear and beloved? How could it possibly be so that what is
born, created, conditioned, and liable to wear out should not wear out,
even the Realized One's body?"

Now at that time four of the leading Mallas, having bathed their heads
and dressed in unworn clothes, said, "We shall light the Buddha's
funeral pyre." But they were unable to do so.

The Mallas said to Anuruddha, "What is the cause, Venerable Anuruddha,
what is the reason why these four Mallian chiefs are unable to light the
Buddha's funeral pyre?"

"Vāseṭṭhas, the deities have a different plan."

"But sir, what is the deities' plan?"

"The deities' plan is this: Venerable Mahākassapa is
traveling along the road from Pāvā to Kusinārā
together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants.
The Buddha's funeral pyre shall not burn until he bows with his head at
the Buddha's feet."

"Sir, let it be as the deities plan."

Then Venerable Mahākassapa arrived at the Mallian shrine
named Coronation at Kusinārā and approached the Buddha's
funeral pyre. Arranging his robe over one shoulder and raising his
joined palms, he respectfully circled the Buddha three times, keeping
him on his right, and bowed with his head at the Buddha's feet. And the
five hundred mendicants did likewise. And when Mahākassapa
and the five hundred mendicants bowed the Buddha's funeral pyre burst
into flames all by itself.

And when the Buddha's corpse was cremated no ash or soot was found from
outer or inner skin, flesh, sinews, or synovial fluid. Only the relics
remained.[^525] It's like when ghee or oil blaze and burn, and neither
ashes nor soot are found. In the same way, when the Buddha's corpse was
cremated no ash or soot was found from outer or inner skin, flesh,
sinews, or synovial fluid. Only the relics remained. And of those five
hundred pairs of garments only two were not burnt: the innermost and the
outermost. But when the Buddha's corpse was consumed the funeral pyre
was extinguished by a stream of water that appeared in the sky,[^526] by
water dripping from the sal trees, and by the Mallas' fragrant water.

Then the Mallas made a cage of spears for the Buddha's relics in the
town hall and surrounded it with a buttress of bows. For seven days they
honored, respected, revered, and venerated them with dance and song and
music and garlands and fragrances.

## 39. Distributing the Relics

King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha,
heard[^527] that the Buddha had become fully quenched at
Kusinārā. He sent an envoy to the Mallas of
Kusinārā: "The Buddha was an aristocrat and so am I. I too
deserve a share of the Buddha's relics. I will build a monument for them
and conduct a memorial service."[^528]

The Licchavis of Vesālī also heard that the Buddha had
become fully quenched at Kusinārā. They sent an envoy to
the Mallas of Kusinārā: "The Buddha was an aristocrat and
so are we. We too deserve a share of the Buddha's relics. We will build
a monument for them and conduct a memorial service."

The Sakyans of Kapilavatthu also heard that the Buddha had become fully
quenched at Kusinārā. They sent an envoy to the Mallas of
Kusinārā: "The Buddha was our foremost relative. We too
deserve a share of the Buddha's relics. We will build a monument for
them and conduct a memorial service."

The Bulis of Allakappa also heard[^529] that the Buddha had become fully
quenched at Kusinārā. They sent an envoy to the Mallas of
Kusinārā: "The Buddha was an aristocrat and so are we. We
too deserve a share of the Buddha's relics. We will build a monument for
them and conduct a memorial service."

The Koliyans of Rāmagāma also heard[^530] that the Buddha
had become fully quenched at Kusinārā. They sent an envoy
to the Mallas of Kusinārā: "The Buddha was an aristocrat
and so are we. We too deserve a share of the Buddha's relics. We will
build a monument for them and conduct a memorial service."

The brahmin of Veṭhadīpa also heard[^531] that the Buddha
had become fully quenched at Kusinārā. He sent an envoy to
the Mallas of Kusinārā: "The Buddha was an aristocrat and I
am a brahmin. I too deserve a share of the Buddha's relics. I will build
a monument for them and conduct a memorial service."

The Mallas of Pāvā also heard that the Buddha had become
fully quenched at Kusinārā. They sent an envoy to the
Mallas of Kusinārā: "The Buddha was an aristocrat and so
are we. We too deserve a share of the Buddha's relics. We will build a
monument for them and conduct a memorial service."

When they had spoken, the Mallas of Kusinārā said to those
various groups: "The Buddha was fully quenched in our village district.
We will not give away a share of his relics."[^532]

Then Doṇa the brahmin said to those various groups:[^533]

> "Hear, sirs, a single word from me.\
> Our Buddha's teaching was acceptance.\
> It would not be good to fight over[^534]\
> a share of the supreme person's relics.
>
> Let us make eight portions, good sirs,\
> rejoicing in unity and harmony.\
> Let there be monuments far and wide,[^535]\
> so many folk may gain faith in the Clear-eyed One!"

"Well then, brahmin, you yourself should fairly divide the Buddha's
relics in eight portions."

"Yes, sirs," replied Doṇa to those various groups. He
divided the relics as asked and said to them, "Sirs, please give me the
urn, and I shall build a monument for it and conduct a memorial
service." So they gave Doṇa the urn.

The Moriyas of Pippalivana heard[^536] that the Buddha had become fully
quenched at Kusinārā. They sent an envoy to the Mallas of
Kusinārā: "The Buddha was an aristocrat, and so are we. We
too deserve a share of the Buddha's relics. We will build a monument for
them and conduct a memorial service."

"There is no portion of the Buddha's relics left, they have already been
portioned out. Here, take the embers." So they took the embers.

## 40. Venerating the Relics

Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha,[^537] the Licchavis of
Vesālī, the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu, the Bulis of
Allakappa, the Koliyans of Rāmagāma, the brahmin of
Veṭhadīpa, the Mallas of Pāvā, the Mallas of
Kusinārā, the brahmin Doṇa, and the Moriyas of
Pippalivana built monuments for them and conducted memorial services.
Thus there were eight monuments for the relics, a ninth for the urn, and
a tenth for the embers. That is how it was in the old days.[^538]

> There were eight shares\
> \>of the Clear-eyed One's relics.[^539]\
> Seven were worshipped in the Black Plum Tree Land.\
> But one share of the most excellent of men\
> was worshipped in Rāmagāma by a dragon king.
>
> One tooth is venerated\
> \>by the gods of the Three and Thirty,\
> and one is worshipped in the city of Gandhāra;\
> another one in the realm of the Kaliṅga King,\
> and one is worshipped by a dragon king.
>
> Through their glory this rich earth\
> is adorned with the best of offerings.[^540]\
> Thus the Clear-eyed One's corpse\
> is well honored by the honorable.
>
> It's venerated by lords of gods, dragons, and spirits;\
> and likewise venerated by the finest lords of men.\
> Honor it with joined palms when you get the chance,\
> for a Buddha is rare even in a hundred eons.
>
> Altogether forty even teeth,\
> and the body hair and head hair,\
> were carried off individually by gods\
> across the universe.
