[^1]: This late sutta satirizes the failings of Sunakkhatta in a fashion
    so broad that it borders on slapstick. The town of Anupiya is
    mentioned only here.

[^2]: The Bhaggava clan was descended from the ancient sage Bhagu
    (Sanskrit Bhṛgu). They received the gift of fire
    conveyed by Mātariśvan the wind from the god Agni (eg.
    Rig Veda 1.60.1). In Pali they appear as potters (eg. [MN
    81:19.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn81/en/sujato#19.3), [MN
    140:1.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn140/en/sujato#1.3), [SN
    1.50:11.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn1.50/en/sujato#11.2), [SN
    2.24:12.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn2.24/en/sujato#12.2)).
    Archaeologists refer to the strata around the Buddha's time as the
    Northern Black Polished Ware culture on account of the distinctive
    highly glazed polish that was achieved on the pottery of the time.
    This, together with the production of iron, marked a significant
    advance in the mastery of fire. Thus potters were no mere humble
    craftsmen, but leading technological innovators.

[^3]: Sunakkhatta's dismal spiritual career began when he met the Buddha
    in [MN 105](https://suttacentral.net/mn105/en/sujato). In [DN
    6:5.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn6/en/sujato#5.3) we learn that,
    after being ordained three years, he spoke of his limited success in
    meditation. The current sutta and [MN
    12](https://suttacentral.net/mn12/en/sujato) deal with Sunakkhatta's
    bitter criticisms of the Buddha shortly after his disrobal.

[^4]: A candidate for ordination is expected to go for refuge to the
    Buddha, and may be said to live dedicated (*uddissa*) to him ([Kd
    1:23.4.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#23.4.1)).
    Moreover, a noble disciple is unable to dedicate themselves to
    another teacher ([AN
    1.276:1.1](https://suttacentral.net/an1.276/en/sujato#1.1)). But
    when the Buddha called candidates to go forth, he spoke of practice
    rather than personal devotion: "Come, monk. The Teaching is
    well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end
    of suffering." ([Kd
    1:6.32.3](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#6.32.3))

[^5]: He makes a similar criticism at [MN
    12:3.8](https://suttacentral.net/mn12/en/sujato#3.8).

[^6]: There are at least eight spellings for this tribe, including
    *thulu*, *bumu* and *khulu*. Below we meet a member of the ruling
    clan of the tribe named *korakhattiya*. I propose that *kora* is "of
    Kuru" by way of secondary derivation; cp. Koravya as a regular name
    for the kings of Kuru. Thus *korakhattiya* is not a personal name,
    but rather "the aristocrat of Kuru". The name of the city
    *uttarakā* means "northern", and Kuru is indeed
    northern. Occam's razor would urge us not to assume the existence of
    an otherwise unknown tribe on such a dubious term when it can be
    explained more parsimoniously as an ancient misspelling of Kuru. The
    Chinese at DA 15 (T 1, 67a15) has ("white clay"), which does not
    seem to clear it up.

[^7]: This practice is further described, along with the "cow vow", at
    [MN 57](https://suttacentral.net/mn57/en/sujato).

[^8]: "Holy man" is *sādhurūpo* (cp. [Dhp
    263](https://suttacentral.net/dhp263/en/sujato), [AN
    6.54:26.1](https://suttacentral.net/an6.54/en/sujato#26.1)).

[^9]: *Alasaka* is otherwise unknown in early Pali. Sanskrit medical
    texts describe it as flatulent indigestion. This agrees with the
    subcommentary's *ajīraṇena āmarogena*
    ("indigestion"). \| In this sutta, the Buddha is depicted as making
    specific predictions about the future, whereas normally he does not
    and probably cannot. Rather, he makes conditional predictions that
    if such courses are pursued, such results will follow.

[^10]: The terrifying Kālakañjas are mentioned at [DN
    20:12.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn20/en/sujato#12.5).

[^11]: This whole passage is unprecedented in early Buddhism. If
    Sunakkhatta was indeed able to revive the dead with three punches,
    it would explain why he thought so little of the Buddha's powers.
    But the ease with which this information is obtained contrasts with
    the elaborate failures of Pāyāsi ([DN
    23](https://suttacentral.net/dn23/en/sujato)).

[^12]: Spellings for Kaḷāramaṭṭaka vary greatly.

[^13]: In these practices we see some examples of the vows or
    observances (*vata*) that Buddha rejected as "grasping at precepts
    and observances"

[^14]: A diet of pure meat is still undertaken today by certain would-be
    gurus.

[^15]: Compare the "vow of restraint in the directions" in the Jain
    Tattvārthasūtra 7.1.

[^16]: *Āsādimhase* is middle aorist plural. Below
    Sunakkhatta again refers to himself in plural, but as usual I render
    with singular.

[^17]: The Burmese reading *pāthikaputta* means "son of a
    traveler". However the commentary says Pāṭika (or
    Pāthika) was the name of his father.

[^18]: For *ñāṇavādo* ("one who speaks from knowledge") see
    [AN 9.38:3.3](https://suttacentral.net/an9.38/en/sujato#3.3), [AN
    10.24:2.1](https://suttacentral.net/an10.24/en/sujato#2.1), [MN
    26:15.7](https://suttacentral.net/mn26/en/sujato#15.7).

[^19]: "Ambiguous" is *dvayagāminī*, literally "two-going".

[^20]: *Apadāna* means "what has been left over, leavings,
    traces".

[^21]: This kind of elaborate display is commonly depicted in late
    texts, but is not otherwise found in early Pali.

[^22]: Compare [DN
    1:1.36.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#1.36.3). The
    following passage is largely adapted from the
    Brahmajālasutta.

[^23]: Text has *suññaṁ*, but this appears to be a mistake,
    since the mansion is no longer "empty" as Brahmā is
    already there. Follow [DN
    1:2.4.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#2.4.3), which lacks
    *suññaṁ*.

[^24]: This statement is not explicitly phrased as a question, but the
    Mahāsaṅgīti edition inconsistently punctuates it as
    one. It makes more sense in context, especially as a response to the
    initial question: *Kathaṁvihitakaṁ* ("How do you
    describe ...") ... *Evaṁvihitakaṁ* ("Is this how you
    describe ...").

[^25]: This is adopted from [DN
    1:2.2.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#2.2.1). These
    philosophers belong with the "partial eternalists".

[^26]: [DN 1:2.7.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#2.7.2).

[^27]: [DN 1:2.10.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#2.10.2).

[^28]: [DN 1:2.31.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#2.31.1).

[^29]: The Buddha refers to the events of this sutta at [DN
    8:23.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn8/en/sujato#23.2), but apart from
    that Nigrodha ("Banyan") appears to be unknown. A "wanderer" may or
    may not be Brahmanical, but in DN 8 Nigrodha is called
    *tapabrahmacārī*, which suggests he was a celibate
    student of a Brahmanical teacher. \| The commentary describes
    *udumbarikā* ("Fig") as *devī* ("Queen"),
    while DA 8 says she is a "brahmin lady". She too does not seem to
    appear elsewhere.

[^30]: Sandhāna ("Conciliation") was recognized as an
    eminent lay follower at ([AN
    6.120--139:1.14](https://suttacentral.net/an6.120-139/en/sujato#1.14)).

[^31]: "One-eyed cow" is *gokāṇā*.

[^32]: *Orodheyyāma* normally means "enclose, trap" like ox
    in a pen ([AN
    6.60:3.1](https://suttacentral.net/an6.60/en/sujato#3.1)), but here
    it is glossed in the commentary as *vinandheyyāma*
    ("twist around").

[^33]: This discourse highlights the Buddha's method of engaging with
    people of other religions. He is open-hearted and interested in
    their views. He prefers to build on common ground, but is not afraid
    to criticize when it is warranted. And his aim is not to win
    converts, but to help people be free of suffering.

[^34]: "Higher disgust of sin" renders *adhijegucche*. The idea is that
    people are tainted with corruption, somewhat comparable to the
    notion of "original sin", although due to their own actions in the
    past rather than ancestral legacy. In "disgust" at that sin, they
    practice forms of fervent mortification (*tapas*) to burn out the
    corruption.

[^35]: The phrase *kathaṁ santā* is unique; it
    echoes *evaṁ sante* below.

[^36]: See the passage at [DN
    8:14.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn8/en/sujato#14.3) and notes
    thereto.

[^37]: The Buddha shifts attention from the external practice to the
    psychological state that accompanies it.

[^38]: "In expectation" (*sāpekkho*): when they give up
    something they cannot eat, they expect to be given more suitable
    food.

[^39]: "Sneaks" is *attānaṁ adassayamāno*,
    literally, "not showing himself". They like to hang about with lay
    folk, but hide the fact that they do so.

[^40]: As here, this item typically follows "wrong view". At [AN
    10.78:1.9](https://suttacentral.net/an10.78/en/sujato#1.9) it is
    said to be a bad quality of Jain ascetics. Thus being "attached to
    one's own views" refers both to the subjective clinging as well as
    the objective incorrectness of the views.

[^41]: A "fourfold restraint" (*cātuyāma*, or
    *cāujjāma* in Jain Ardhamagadhi) is attributed to Jain
    founder Pārśva in Isibhāsiyāiṁ 31, where
    it is an abbreviated list: "from refraining from killing to
    refraining from possessions"
    (*pāṇātivāta-veramaṇeṇaṁ jāvā
    pariggaha-veramaṇeṇaṁ*); the missing items are not
    stealing (*asteya*) and truth (*satya*). The Jain text
    Uttarādhyayanasūtra 23 shows that Mahāvīra
    added nakedness to make five. Five are also found in
    Yogasūtra 2.30 and the Jain
    Tattvārthasūtra 7: non-harming (*ahiṁsā*),
    truth (*satya*), no stealing (*asteya*), celibacy (*brahmacarya*),
    and non-possessiveness (*aparigrahā*). \| A different
    "fourfold restraint" is said to be a Jain practice at [DN
    2:29.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#29.2).

[^42]: This extends the basic precept. The same analysis is applied to
    the "ten ways of performing deeds" at [AN
    3.163](https://suttacentral.net/an3.163/en/sujato). \| The
    distinction between one's own action and another's action is noted
    at Isibhāsiyāiṁ 31.42, although the wording and sense
    are different.

[^43]: *Bhāvitamāsīsati* is unique. In this and similar
    contexts, the Pali tradition says *bhāvita* ("reward",
    normally "developed") is the "five sense pleasures" as they see it
    (*bhāvitaṁ nāma tesaṁ
    saññāya pañca kāmaguṇā*; cp.
    [MN 56](https://suttacentral.net/mn56/en/sujato) commentary: *ettha
    ca bhāvitanti pañcakāmaguṇā*), explaining
    that this is a usage of the sectarians (Saddanīti ch.
    4: *titthiyasamaye pana bhāvitoti kāmaguṇo
    vuccati*).

[^44]: This passage sets a powerful template for sincere engagement.

[^45]: This whole ending sequence is unique.

[^46]: *Mātulā* means "maternal uncle". This Magadhan
    village is mentioned only here and [Cp
    9:39.2](https://suttacentral.net/cp9/en/sujato#39.2).

[^47]: As at [DN
    16:2.26.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#2.26.1).

[^48]: Two parables on mindfulness expand this idea ([SN
    47.6](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.6/en/sujato), [SN
    46.7](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.7/en/sujato)).

[^49]: *Evamidaṁ* indicates entailment, as at [SN
    56.21:1.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.21/en/sujato#1.3), [MN
    73:13.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn73/en/sujato#13.2), [DN
    16:4.2.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#4.2.4).

[^50]: We have heard the story of the wheel-turning monarch
    Mahāsudassana in [DN
    17](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato). Daḷhanemi
    appears only here. His name means "Strong-rim", such being one of
    the characteristics of the Wheel. His story of renunciation shares
    much in common with that of Maghadeva ([MN
    83](https://suttacentral.net/mn83/en/sujato)).

[^51]: "Receded back" (*osakkitaṁ*): like a woman shrinking
    away from a man's unwanted advances ([DN
    12:16.12](https://suttacentral.net/dn12/en/sujato#16.12)).

[^52]: The same point of view is expressed at [Bi Pc
    21:1.4](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc21/en/sujato#1.4),
    where sex workers teased nuns, suggesting they enjoy themselves
    while young and ordain when old. The Buddhist position is that
    Dhamma can be practiced at any age.

[^53]: The signs of the renunciate predate Buddhism.

[^54]: "Inherited from your father" (*pettikaṁ
    dāyajjaṁ*) calls back to the four
    *satipaṭṭhānas* that for a mendicant are "the domain of
    your fathers" (*pettike visaye*). In both cases they are to be
    earned, not conferred by lineage.

[^55]: "The noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch" (*ariye
    cakkavattivatte*; this is locative singular). *Ariya* ("noble")
    qualifies "duty" (*vatta*), as it does in the title below,
    *cakkavattiariyavatta*, rather than "monarch". Normally *ariya* is
    reserved for those who have attained the Buddhist path, but here we
    might have a rare use of *ariya* in reference to Indo-Aryan (Vedic)
    culture. Compare the use of *ariyaka* for speakers of Indo-Aryan
    languages at [Bu Pj
    1:8.4.10](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/sujato#8.4.10).
    However, the commentary says it simply means "flawless" (*niddoso*).

[^56]: *Saṁvidahassu* is second middle imperative.

[^57]: *Pavattittha* is aorist middle. *(A)dhammakāra*
    ("(in)justice") doesn't seem to occur elsewhere in early Pali. It is
    found in Ja 513 and Ja 498, both times in the context of just rule.

[^58]: "Provide" (*anuppadeti*) is used elsewhere in the sense of paying
    back a loan ([AN
    3.20:3.5](https://suttacentral.net/an3.20/en/sujato#3.5)), serving
    honored guests ([SN
    7.2:2.6](https://suttacentral.net/sn7.2/en/sujato#2.6)), paying
    wages ([DN 31:32.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn31/en/sujato#32.2)),
    or a king supplying provisions for essential workers to do their job
    ([DN 5:11.8](https://suttacentral.net/dn5/en/sujato#11.8)). It is
    thus more about fulfilling a moral obligation of fairness than
    offering charity.

[^59]: Where the phrase "from time to time go to them" (*te
    kālena kālaṁ upasaṅkamitvā*)
    occurs elsewhere in the suttas, it is always followed by "ask and
    question" (*paripucchati paripañhati*). Here, however,
    the second verb is "you should learn"
    (*pariggaṇheyyāsi*).

[^60]: "Own ideas" is *sa-mata*.

[^61]: *Pabbanti* is unusual and probably unique in early Pali. It is
    related to Sanskrit *parvati* ("fill") and is explained by the
    commentary as *vaḍḍhanti* ("grow, prosper"). \| I
    assume *janapadā* ("countries") is a misspelling of
    *jānapadā* ("people of the country"), as *janapada* is
    otherwise in singular.

[^62]: "Military officers" (*anīkaṭṭhā*) would have been
    standing officers in the army. According to both the commentary here
    and Monier-Williams' Sanskrit Dictionary (*anīkastha*),
    it includes elephant officers, who would have stood at the head of
    the army. \| "Professional advisers" (*mantassājīvino*)
    is explained by the commentary as those who make a living from
    giving wise advice.

[^63]: Ensuring citizens have enough to live on is not merely a matter
    of kindness and common decency, but is crucial to ensure stability
    and national unity.

[^64]: The origins of theft are told at [DN
    27:19.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn27/en/sujato#19.1). The myth
    recounted here overlaps, with points of both similarity and
    difference.

[^65]: The king uses the same procedure as the Buddha. When presented
    with an alleged wrong-doer, the first thing is to ask them whether
    they did it.

[^66]: Simply providing money is not enough, nor is simply expecting
    that people can just work for what they want. They need something to
    get started, together with the support and opportunity to build a
    life for themselves.

[^67]: Sadly, bad faith actors take advantage of kindness.

[^68]: While the king's concern is legitimate, his overreaction
    escalates the problems.

[^69]: The violence of the state leads to an armed and violent
    citizenry.

[^70]: Today we can see that, even among developed nations, a degraded
    and violent culture leads to declining lifespans.

[^71]: *Paresaṁ dāresu*: both "others" and
    "wives" are in plural, so polygyny is assumed. Compare *parassa
    dāresu* ("the wives of another") at [SN
    55.7:6.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn55.7/en/sujato#6.3). Note the
    significance granted to beauty in influencing human society.

[^72]: At this point, the three factors of wrong action---killing,
    stealing, and sexual misconduct---are present, as are the four
    factors of wrong speech---lying, backbiting, harsh speech, and
    nonsensical speech.

[^73]: This completes the three factors of unskillful thought: desire,
    ill will, and wrong views (which are a strong form of delusion).
    Here wrong view probably means moral nihilism.

[^74]: These three terms recur in a similar context at [AN
    3.56:2.1](https://suttacentral.net/an3.56/en/sujato#2.1). The
    commentaries to the two passages give quite different explanations.
    \| "Illicit desire" (*adhammarāgo*) probably refers to
    any form of desire that is illegal or transgressive, such as incest,
    rape, or pedophilia. \| "Immoral greed" (*visamalobho*) implies
    excess and imbalance. Both are, however, explained in the commentary
    to [AN 3.56:2.1](https://suttacentral.net/an3.56/en/sujato#2.1) as
    desire for the belongings of others. \| *Micchādhammo*
    is hard to pin down. Its opposite, *sammā dhammo*
    always means "right teaching". The commentary here explains it as
    "men with men and women with women", but this must be rejected as
    there is no hint anywhere in early Pali (or elsewhere in early
    Indian culture) that homosexual relations were considered immoral.
    The commentary to [AN
    3.56:2.1](https://suttacentral.net/an3.56/en/sujato#2.1) explains it
    as "indulgence in what is reckoned an inappropriate basis"
    (*avatthupaṭisevanasaṅkhātena*). This implies
    intercourse with one of the women mentioned at [MN
    41:8.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn41/en/sujato#8.4), which includes
    those who are "protected by principle"
    (*dhammarakkhitā*). This sense of *dhamma* is explained
    at [Bu Ss
    5:4.2.16](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5/en/sujato#4.2.16)
    as "religion". Here I think the sense is similar: customs or beliefs
    that legitimize immorality.

[^75]: This brings us to the Buddha's present.

[^76]: Here the Buddha paints a devastating picture of societal
    collapse. Life expectancy as low as thirty years has been recorded
    in some countries in the 20th century.

[^77]: The age of onset of puberty has been dropping globally over the
    past century, with isolated cases as young as five.

[^78]: "Finger millet" (*kudrūsaka*; Pahari *kodra*,
    Garhwal *koda*) is a robust secondary grain in Asia and Africa,
    growing in places rice cannot. Due to its resilience in the face of
    global heating, 2023 was declared the International Year of Millets
    by the UN.

[^79]: The Buddha's father gave this luxury food to servants and staff
    ([AN 3.39:2.3](https://suttacentral.net/an3.39/en/sujato#2.3)).

[^80]: The narrative above traced the gradual disappearance of these ten
    factors. \| *Atibyādippissanti* is a unique term. At
    [AN 7.66:9.2](https://suttacentral.net/an7.66/en/sujato#9.2) a sign
    of the end of days is the "erupting" (*ādippanti*) of
    volcanoes, suggesting "explode" for the intensive form here.

[^81]: "Skillful" is *kusala*, otherwise translated as "good" or
    "wholesome".

[^82]: At [AN 2.9](https://suttacentral.net/an2.9/en/sujato) = [Iti
    42](https://suttacentral.net/iti42/en/sujato) the world is protected
    from this by conscience and prudence.

[^83]: For *sambheda* in the sense of "dissolving, leaking", see [DN
    3:1.15.11](https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato#1.15.11), [AN
    5.103:6.4](https://suttacentral.net/an5.103/en/sujato#6.4), [AN
    10.45:4.1](https://suttacentral.net/an10.45/en/sujato#4.1). The
    commentary here says "mixedness, breaking of boundaries".

[^84]: "Interregnum of swords" is *satthantarakappo*. Seven days seems
    optimistic.

[^85]: Dehumanization of the other is an essential precursor to
    genocide.

[^86]: "Let us neither kill nor be killed" (*mā ca
    mayaṁ kañci, mā ca amhe
    koci*) is an idiomatic phrase, the Golden Rule framed as a negative:
    "Let us not do unto others nor let others do unto us." It is
    explained by the commentary as, "Let us not take even a single
    person's life or let them take ours".

[^87]: *Sabhāgāyissanti* = *sabhāga* +
    *āyissanti* = "will come together". \|
    *Samassāsissanti* = *sama* + *sāsati* =
    "cry in one voice". The latter term is absent from some manuscripts.

[^88]: *Diṭṭhā* is Sanskrit *diṣṭyā*,
    "fantastic, how fortunate", per [DN
    16:2.24.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#2.24.5) and [Ja
    81:1.4](https://suttacentral.net/ja81/en/sujato#1.4). \|
    *Sattā* is nominative singular for *sattar* ("enemy"),
    not plural of *satta* ("being"), which disagrees with both verb and
    vocative in number.

[^89]: The first precept, and the first of the ten ways of skillful
    action. The Buddhist ethical principles are not just a part of
    Buddhist teaching, they are essential for the healthy functioning of
    human society.

[^90]: In the legendary past, too, only these three afflictions
    prevailed ([Snp
    2.7:29.1](https://suttacentral.net/snp2.7/en/sujato#29.1)).

[^91]: Ketumatī means "adorned with flags".

[^92]: Saṅkha is "conch shell".

[^93]: This is the only sutta appearance of the future Buddha Metteyya
    (Sanskrit Maitreya, meaning "one full of love"). He became a
    prominent figure in later Buddhism.

[^94]: Throughout, the Buddha is concerned to emphasize that the future
    Buddha will offer no more or less than his own teaching and
    practice. He wanted people to practice now, not to establish a cult
    of a future savior.

[^95]: The maximum number of monastics cited in the suttas is 1250 at a
    single gathering.

[^96]: This event is found in Bhaddaji's verses at [Thag
    2.22](https://suttacentral.net/thag2.22/en/sujato), expanded to a
    full story at Ja 264. The commentary explains *yūpa* as
    "palace", but Bhaddaji's verses clearly depict a sacrificial post,
    to which the animal would be tied for slaughter. Such posts are
    connected with the horse sacrifice, which establishes imperial
    power. This is but one aspect of the wheel-turning monarch to draw
    on imagery from the horse sacrifice. Here, of course, no horses are
    killed.

[^97]: *Ajjhāvasati* in this sutta means "reign" not
    "dwell" ([DN 26:2.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn26/en/sujato#2.5)).

[^98]: This sutta is the closest we come to a Buddhist myth of origins.
    It draws on features of Vedic mythology, while giving its own spin.
    Related stories may be found in [DN
    26](https://suttacentral.net/dn26/en/sujato) and [Snp
    2.7](https://suttacentral.net/snp2.7/en/sujato). The Buddha
    describes a natural process of evolution that requires no
    metaphysical intervention, yet differs strikingly from Darwinian
    evolution in prioritizing the role of desire over selection.

[^99]: After the Jetavana, this was the best-known monastery in
    Sāvatthī. It was offered by the lady
    Visākhā, known as Migāra's mother.

[^100]: We met Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja as the
    students of Pokkharasāti and Tārukkha
    respectively in [DN 13](https://suttacentral.net/dn13/en/sujato), at
    the end of which they went for refuge. Some time later they must
    have asked for ordination. The commentary says that probation
    (*paravasati*) was required, not because they had previously gone
    forth in other sects (as the naked ascetic Kassapa at [DN
    8:24.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn8/en/sujato#24.1) or the wanderer
    Subhadda at [DN
    16:5.29.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#5.29.1)), nor
    because they had committed an offence, but because they were not yet
    the required twenty years of age.

[^101]: Here as in [DN 13](https://suttacentral.net/dn13/en/sujato)
    Vāseṭṭha takes the lead.

[^102]: This verse is also at [MN
    84:9.19](https://suttacentral.net/mn84/en/sujato#9.19) and [MN
    93:5.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn93/en/sujato#5.4). \| For "best
    class" (*seṭṭho vaṇṇo*) see
    *varṇaśreṣṭhaḥ* at Mahābhārata 1.24.4c.

[^103]: Mahābhārata 12.181.5 says that brahmins are the
    white class, aristocrats red, peasants yellow, and menials black.
    Underlying this is an assumption of the superiority of the
    fair-skinned northerners of Indo-Aryan descent over the dark-skinned
    natives (see [DN
    3:1.10.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato#1.10.3)).

[^104]: I cannot trace this statement to Brahmanical texts, and indeed
    they have a strong tendency to push back against the idea that only
    brahmins can find purity.

[^105]: An allusion to the famous Puruṣasūkta (Rig Veda
    10.90.12): "His (the cosmic Man's) mouth became the brahmin, his
    arms became the ruler (*rājanya*, an alternate name for
    the *khattiyas*), his thighs became the peasant
    (*vaiśya*); the menial (*sūdra*) was born
    from his feet." This belongs to the latest portion of the Rig Veda,
    and probably represents a time when the system of four castes was
    established in the late Vedic period, some centuries before the
    Buddha. Apart from this, the Rig Veda hardly mentions any of these
    as castes, let alone all four together.

[^106]: The Buddha gives a rationalist critique of Vedic myth (see also
    [MN 93:5.9](https://suttacentral.net/mn93/en/sujato#5.9)), the
    fairness of which is not easy to assess. Within the Brahmanical
    world, especially the progressive Kosalan brahmins to whom
    Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja belonged, there
    had been a shift towards a more nuanced symbolic understanding of
    such claims. Yet the subtle distinctions of the philosophers rarely
    influence the more straightforward beliefs of the common
    practitioner.

[^107]: "Dark" (*kaṇha*) and "bright" (or "light", *sukka*)
    are redefined in ethical not racial terms.

[^108]: Vedic theory claimed that the caste system was part of the order
    of nature (*dhamma*) established by Brahmā, and hence
    to follow the obligations of caste was a duty (also *dhamma*). The
    Buddha posited a higher "principle" (*dhamma*) beyond caste. The
    English word "principle" carries the senses of a fundamental law; a
    code of conduct; a devotion to right living; a source; and an
    underlying faculty, all of which are aspects of *dhamma* in this
    passage.

[^109]: A great king such as Pasenadi ruled his central realm, while
    outlying districts pledged allegiance to him, enjoying royal
    protection while ceding some sovereignty. It is the same
    relationship described for the kingdoms subsumed under the
    Wheel-Turning Monarch (eg. [DN
    17:1.9.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato#1.9.5)). The
    Buddha described his people as natives among the Kosalans at [Snp
    3.1:18.4](https://suttacentral.net/snp3.1/en/sujato#18.4).

[^110]: The Mahāsaṅgīti reading *na naṁ*
    yields a better sense than the PTS *nanu*, which would make this a
    question.

[^111]: Vāseṭṭha was said to be a high family, while
    Bhāradvāja was low ([Bu Pc
    2:2.1.18](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2/en/sujato#2.1.18)).

[^112]: The Buddha adapts the Brahmanical rhetoric of birth from the
    "mouth of Brahmā". Having criticized them for taking
    this literally he employs it in a metaphorical sense.

[^113]: "The embodiment of principle" is *dhammakāya*. This
    is a term of unique occurrence in the suttas, which was seized on in
    later days to posit a metaphysical theory of a quasi-eternal Buddha.
    In the suttas, it means that he, having practiced the Dhamma to its
    fullest, embodies the qualities of the Dhamma to the highest degree.

[^114]: Here begins the story of origins. The Buddha begins his creation
    myth with the end of the world. For this passage, compare [DN
    1:2.2.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#2.2.1).

[^115]: In the Brahmajālasutta, beings pass from one
    Brahmā realm to another, but when they come to this
    world it is as a human. Here we have a different perspective, where
    beings apparently still like the Brahmā gods exist in
    the physical realm.

[^116]: The role of food is critical throughout this narrative. Food is
    a fundamental sustenance on which all creatures must rely, and the
    nature of the food reflects the type of creature that eats it.
    Taittirīya Upaniṣad 2.5.1 says the highest
    form of self is made of bliss (*ātmā
    ānandamaya*).

[^117]: Creation myths often begin with a dark, formless world of water,
    and describe the emergence of divisions and structures of the world.
    They do not differentiate the physical, biological, ecological, or
    social, as such distinctions came later.

[^118]: Throughout, the discourse has a special interest in tracing the
    origins of language and how different usages came about. Here the
    term "beings" is presented as a natural choice: they are "beings"
    because they are alive. Later, words are selected to convey a
    certain political or moral stance.

[^119]: The reading and sense of *samatani* is obscure. I think it is
    connected with *santānaka* in the next line, in the
    sense of "networks" or tendrils appearing in the water as it
    curdles. The Sanskrit at SF 277 and Mūlasarvāstvāda
    Vinaya 17 has *saṁmūrcchitaḥ saṁtanoti*
    ("curdled tendrils"). \| *Rasapathavī* ("earth's
    nectar") is also obscure. We would expect *pathavīrasa*
    (cp. *phalarasa* "fruit juice", etc.), which is indeed found at [SN
    5.9:5.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn5.9/en/sujato#5.3) in the sense
    "nutriments in soil". Since this reading also appears here in the
    Sanskrit sources, I assume it is the correct sense. For another
    example of a *tappurisa* compound with reversed order, see [DN
    4:6.46](https://suttacentral.net/dn4/en/sujato#6.46).

[^120]: *Khuddā* (literally "small one") is said to be a
    species of small bee, also known in Sanskrit as
    *kṣudrā*. The "dwarf bee" (*apis florea*) fits the
    bill, as it is a small wild honeybee found in India.

[^121]: Ghee and honey were among the finest offerings to the gods. The
    soma was often described as "honeyed". Our text is suggesting that
    the Vedic sacrifices led to the corruption of divinity.

[^122]: For *acchadesi* read *assādesi* ("enjoyed") after
    Mu Kd 17's *āsvādayati*. The commentary explains
    *acchadesi* as "becomes suffused", so if it is a misreading it is an
    old one.

[^123]: At [DN 26:17.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn26/en/sujato#17.2) it
    is the ugly ones who are at fault for jealousy.

[^124]: This is another veiled critique of the Vedic tradition. In [DN
    13:13.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn13/en/sujato#13.1) the Buddha
    told Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja the Vedas
    were recited by people who did not understand them. This problem was
    well understood within the tradition of the Brāhmaṇas
    and Upaniṣads, which constantly emphasized that they
    are effective for "one who knows this" (*ya evam veda*).

[^125]: "Fungus" is *pappaṭaka* (Sanskrit
    *parpaṭaka*). At [Bu Pj
    1:2.2.5](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/sujato#2.2.5),
    Moggallāna suggests that, to alleviate famine, the
    monks might eat the *pappaṭakojaṁ* ("fungus-nutrition")
    under the earth. Given that it is compared to a mushroom, I think it
    is the fungal mycelia of a mycorrhizal network. Such fungi spread
    like tendrils underground, sometimes appearing above the surface,
    sharing nutrients and information between organisms.

[^126]: Readings and meaning of *padālatā* are uncertain.
    It has usually been understood that the second element is
    *latā* ("creeper"). But this leaves *padā*
    unexplained, and the commentary's gloss of *bhaddālatā*
    is unconvincing. It also leaves unexplained the connection with
    *kalambukā*. This is probably the fruit of the kadam
    tree---fleshy, yellow-orange capsules with about 8000 seeds that
    split apart when ripe. I think *padālatā* is related to
    *padālana* in the sense of "bursting": a seed pod that
    splits open like a fig or pomegranate.

[^127]: The commentary to [Bu Pj
    1:10.6.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/sujato#10.6.1)
    explains "male characteristics" as "beard and whiskers, etc."
    (*massudāṭhikādi*), so this is not just genitals but
    also secondary sex characteristics.

[^128]: Pali *seṭṭhi* is explained by the commentary as
    "ash" (*chārikā*), although this sense does not seem to
    be attested anywhere else. Mahāvastu has
    *leṣṭu* while Mu Kd 17 has *loṣṭa*, both
    explained as "clod". Given that it is easier to throw a clod than
    ash, I think these probably convey the correct sense.

[^129]: *Nassa* could mean "die!" or "get lost". I take the softer
    meaning, as killing has not yet appeared among these beings. \| This
    behavior looks much like scapegoating rituals, where certain members
    of the community are deemed to bear the sins of all and are
    sacrificed to erase the sin. Often the victim was expelled from the
    community, temporarily or permanently.

[^130]: Mob shaming over perceived sexual transgression is the most
    primitive form of moralizing.

[^131]: "Carrying off" (*nibbuyhamānā*) like being swept
    away by a river. Mu Kd 17 says they throw powder, scent, garlands,
    and nets, while wishing the bride happiness and well-being.

[^132]: "Unprincipled" is *adhamma*. In the past the lovers were
    spurned, now they are celebrated in marriage.

[^133]: The sight of others having sex provokes strong reactions of
    arousal, jealousy, and disgust, often leading to violence. A culture
    of sexual modesty regulates these emotions, promoting the growth of
    larger societal structures.

[^134]: Human society evolves first from greed, second from sexual
    desire, and third from laziness. The effort to avoid manual labor
    drives cultural and technological innovation.

[^135]: Humans are focused on short term comforts and ignore long term
    consequences.

[^136]: The wild grasses used as grains evolve in adaptation to human
    needs.

[^137]: The beings tell their story within the story. The oldest myths,
    such as the Vedas or Gilgamesh, speak of myths that were already
    ancient for them. And the oldest story of all is the Fall: the death
    of God, the recession of divinity, how things were better in the old
    days. The story is a reckoning with the consequences of their
    actions, yet it is not sufficient for them to change course.

[^138]: Scarcity has arisen because of greed, giving rise to agriculture
    and land ownership. Up until now, the changes have been driven by
    individual choice, whereas now they are starting to make agreements
    among themselves, hoping to mitigate the irresponsibility of
    individuals.

[^139]: With ownership and inequality come theft.

[^140]: It turns out that moral scolding does not deter wrong-doers.

[^141]: The mob violence escalates.

[^142]: All a direct consequence of thoughtless greed and inequality.

[^143]: "Accuse" is *khīyeyya*. Here the beings are taking
    charge of their social evolution, deciding among themselves how to
    manage their society. They are active agents in their own story, not
    merely passive subjects of evolution. And the primary decision they
    make is to form a democracy by election (*sammata*). Doing so, they
    create a two-class system: rulers and subjects.

[^144]: The origin of upper class, white-collar workers who do not have
    to till the soil. Taxes are not coerced, but voluntarily offered in
    recognition of services rendered.

[^145]: The emphasis on appearance reflects a wider acknowledgement of
    the potency of beauty in shaping human conduct. The Buddha rejected
    the notion that beauty indicates worth (eg. [SN
    21.6](https://suttacentral.net/sn21.6/en/sujato)), yet was himself
    regarded as especially beautiful. Unfair it may be, but beautiful
    people are listened to.

[^146]: The *ehi* formula echoes the original ordination method ([Kd
    1:6.32.3](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#6.32.3)).

[^147]: "Applied to them" (*upanibbattaṁ*) is unique. The
    Sanskrit texts have *saṁjñodapādi*, "arisen by
    agreement". It is distinct from [DN
    27:11.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn27/en/sujato#11.2) above, where
    beings "come to be called" beings (*saṅkhyaṁ
    gacchanti*). Clearly it cannot mean the first word that appeared. I
    take it to mean this was a specialized term invented and applied
    just for them. The commentary says, *na kevalaṁ
    akkharameva*, "not just a universal term".

[^148]: "Aristocrat" (*khattiya*; Sanskrit *kṣatriya*) is
    related to *khatta* ("authority", "power"; in eg. Rig Veda 8.25.8 it
    is an adjective, "powerful"), hence "ruling class". The sutta,
    however, relates it to *khetta*, "field". The two senses possibly
    stem from the same root *kṣi* in the sense "owner",
    "master" with the "field" being the dominion owned by the chief. In
    Pali suttas, the primary connotation of the *khattiya* was of an
    aristocratic land-owning class, so the connection with "field" is
    apt. *Khattiyas* are often said to be a "warrior" caste, but that is
    not a primary association in the suttas. They are rarely depicted as
    having anything to do with the military, which had become
    professionalized by the time of the Buddha. Nonetheless, at [MN
    96:10.7](https://suttacentral.net/mn96/en/sujato#10.7) a
    *khattiya's* wealth is said to be the bow and arrow. At [SN
    3.24](https://suttacentral.net/sn3.24/en/sujato), the Buddha argues
    that someone from any caste could be as proficient a warrior as
    someone from the *khattiya* class.

[^149]: Modern linguists trace the Proto-Indo-European root of
    *rāja* as *\*reg* in the sense "one who leads people in
    a straight line", literally "ruler" or "regulator". The pun
    *rañjeti* ("they please") is meant to emphasize the
    obligations that a ruler has for their people. As here,
    *rājā* and *khattiya* can have the same meaning,
    although commonly a *rājā* is an actual king or chief,
    while *khattiya* is the class from which the rulers come.

[^150]: Read *bāheyyāma*.

[^151]: *Bāhenti* ("set aside") sounds a bit like
    *brāhmaṇa*. Such puns which don't quite land are
    sometimes used to infer a language underlying Pali.
    *Brāhmaṇa* is a Sanskrit form, and the colloquial
    pronunciation may have been closer to *bāhmaṇa*.

[^152]: The phrase *jhāyanti vītaṅgārā
    vītadhūmā pannamusalā* works at a double
    level. *Jhāyanti* is to "meditate" but also is the
    light of a lamp. *Vītaṅgārā vītadhūmā*
    means "without coals and smoke", implying that they do not light
    cooking fires; but as meditation it means their minds are free of
    corruptions. *Pannamusalā* is "with shovel put down",
    i.e. they do not dig the soil (thus killing the creatures there).
    Not cooking or digging are also precepts for Buddhist and Jain
    mendicants.

[^153]: "Meditator" is *jhāyaka*.

[^154]: At [DN 3:2.3.11](https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato#2.3.11)
    the brahmins come down from the forest and set up shrines in the
    town. Chāndogya Upaniṣad 5.10.1--5
    compares the forest contemplatives destined for the
    Brahmā realm with the ritualists who are reborn on the
    moon before returning to earth. \| The "texts" (*ganthe*) were the
    Vedas.

[^155]: *Ajjhāyaka* is from *ajjhāyati* ("to
    recite"), but here it is punned as the negative of
    *jhāyaka* ("meditator").

[^156]: "Various" is *visu*, which loosely echoes *vessa* ("peasant").
    The Sanskrit form is *vaiśya*, from *viś*,
    to "stay" or "settle" on the land. They were probably originally
    peasants who over time transitioned into more diverse livelihoods.
    In [MN 96:10.10](https://suttacentral.net/mn96/en/sujato#10.10) they
    are said to engage in cattle-rearing and agriculture, and over time
    trade was added to that.

[^157]: *Sudda* ("menial") rhymes with *ludda* ("hunter") and *khudda*
    ("minor"). In [MN
    96:10.14](https://suttacentral.net/mn96/en/sujato#10.14) their
    wealth is said to come from the "scythe and flail", i.e. seasonal
    manual labor such as threshing grain ([SN
    35.248:1.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.248/en/sujato#1.2)). At
    [MN 96:16.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn96/en/sujato#16.4),
    bamboo-workers, chariot-makers, and waste-collectors are cited as
    other low-class jobs. They may have originated as a distinct branch
    of Aryan peoples who were assimilated into Vedic culture (Ram Sharan
    Sharma, *Śudras in Ancient India*, 37).

[^158]: "Vocation" is *dhamma*, which is rarely used in the suttas in
    this sense; normally it is universal.

[^159]: The Buddha invokes Brahmā to support his contention
    that his own caste, the *khattiyas*, were superior, a sequence
    supported by Pañcaviṁśa Brāhmaṇa 13.4.7.
    Ultimately, however, the Buddha rejected the notion that caste tells
    us anything intrinsic about the worth of people.

[^160]: This discourse is expanded from the events of [DN
    16:1.16.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#1.16.1).

[^161]: Here the additional material begins. While they are all said to
    be teachings of the Buddha, some sections cannot be traced in the
    Pali Canon as it stands today. Perhaps Sāriputta was
    demonstrating his talent for creative rephrasing and synthesis.

[^162]: Perhaps a reference to his enlightenment experience in [MN
    74](https://suttacentral.net/mn74/en/sujato).

[^163]: Also at [DN
    16:3.50.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#3.50.5), etc.

[^164]: The primary source is the SN 35, the Linked Discourses on the
    Six Sense Fields.

[^165]: The Bodhisatta is said elsewhere to be conceived in awareness
    (eg. [DN
    16:3.15.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#3.15.1)), but
    this systematic analysis is found only here and at [DN
    33:1.11.176](https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#1.11.176). It
    seems like an abrupt shift from central Dhamma topics.

[^166]: Called "demonstrations of revealing"
    (*ādesanāpāṭihāriya*) at [AN
    3.60:9.1](https://suttacentral.net/an3.60/en/sujato#9.1).

[^167]: Meditation is described in this way only in [MN
    136:9.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn136/en/sujato#9.1) and [DN
    1:1.31.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#1.31.1) where, as
    here, it is pursued by an "ascetic or brahmin", who in those cases
    is not Buddhist. Here, however, it sounds like
    Sāriputta is talking about a Buddhist practice. The
    *asubha* contemplation of the parts of the body is described in
    several places in the canon (eg. [DN
    22:5.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn22/en/sujato#5.1)), but never
    exactly like this.

[^168]: The remaining practices are unique to this passage. This is
    perhaps related to the contemplation of death, as it seems to imply
    looking at another person's body rather than one's own.

[^169]: This is a unique description of the process of rebirth.
    Consciousness is a "stream" in that it flows and moves,
    ever-changing, and is not a static self-same entity. To be
    "established" (*patiṭṭhita*) is to be attached because
    of craving. \| The phrase "consistent on both sides" (*ubhayato
    abbocchinnaṁ*) is unique. *Ubhayato* is used of "both
    ends" of a pole [Ja
    533:37.4](https://suttacentral.net/ja533/en/sujato#37.4). I think
    the sense is that one's consciousness is consistent with regards to
    this world and the next. If one is attached to this world, one will
    be attached to the next, and vice versa in the next section.

[^170]: As at [AN
    7.14:1.3](https://suttacentral.net/an7.14/en/sujato#1.3).

[^171]: Normally we would expect the four kinds of right striving here.
    This is the only place the seven awakening factors are described in
    this way.

[^172]: As at [AN 4.166](https://suttacentral.net/an4.166/en/sujato).

[^173]: These descriptions are unique. \| *Vebhūtiya* is
    only used here and DN 30, where the context shows it is a synonym
    for *pesuṇiya*.

[^174]: The Mahāsaṅgīti omits a heading for this section.

[^175]: The sequence from "memory" (*satimā*) to
    "retention" (*dhitimā*) is related to the good
    qualities of Ānanda ([AN
    1.220:1.1](https://suttacentral.net/an1.220/en/sujato#1.1)), and
    pertain to textual fluency. *Satimā* here is "memory",
    not "mindfulness", which is *sato* at the end.

[^176]: We don't find this exact passage elsewhere, but it is similar to
    [AN 10.46](https://suttacentral.net/an10.46/en/sujato). When the
    Buddha speaks of future consequences it is conditional. He is not a
    fortune-teller, but he understands the results of the practice.

[^177]: *Paccattaṁ yonisomanasikārā* occurs at
    [SN 46.8:2.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.8/en/sujato#2.1) and [MN
    50:3.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn50/en/sujato#3.1), where it means
    "investigate inside oneself". Here it is applied to another.

[^178]: Another unique passage, similar to [MN
    68:12.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn68/en/sujato#12.4).

[^179]: Compare the four kinds of eternalism at [DN
    1:3.1.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#3.1.1). The theories
    based on rationality are omitted.

[^180]: According to the PTS edition, the Sinhala-script manuscripts
    read *na jānāmi* ("don"t know") against the
    Mahāsaṅgīti *jānāmi*. \| The means of
    knowledge given here is solely based on the recollection of past
    lives, which agrees with the Brahmajālasutta that these
    are views based on the past. It seems the sectarian here is
    admitting the limits of their experiential knowledge, but
    nonetheless inferring eternalism in both past and future.

[^181]: Some manuscripts read "twenty" here.

[^182]: "Accompanied by defilements and attachments"
    (*sāsavā saupadhikā*) is unique, but
    compare *sāsavā puññabhāgiyā
    upadhivepakkā* at [MN
    117:6.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn117/en/sujato#6.3) and
    *sāsavaṁ upādāniyaṁ* at [SN
    22.48:2.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.48/en/sujato#2.2).

[^183]: Also at [MN
    152:11--15.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn152/en/sujato#11-15.3), [AN
    5.144:2.2](https://suttacentral.net/an5.144/en/sujato#2.2), [SN

    54.8:7.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn54.8/en/sujato#7.1).

[^184]: From the first sermon at [SN
    56.11:2.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11/en/sujato#2.3).

[^185]: Here the jhānas stand in the place of the path as a
    whole. In [DN 29:24.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato#24.5)
    the Buddha uses a similar framing.

[^186]: Here *abhi-* in *abbhanujānāti* conveys the sense
    "grant in respect of one".

[^187]: Here Sāriputta is quoting the Buddha, yet this
    phrase is not found in the Pali Canon.

[^188]: At [MN 115:14.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn115/en/sujato#14.1).

[^189]: There are several individuals called Udāyī.

[^190]: The Vedhaññās are not mentioned elsewhere; their
    name means "Marksmen".

[^191]: When this event is mentioned at [MN
    104:2.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn104/en/sujato#2.1), the Buddha
    is also in the Sakyan lands, but near the village of
    Sāma. Both texts tell the story of Cunda conveying the
    news via Ānanda at Sāma, which was presumably near the
    Vedhaññā's mango grove. It does seem strange that two
    distinct discourses are recorded from the same prompt, but then, why
    shouldn't the Buddha give more than one teaching on such an
    important topic? At [DN
    33:1.6.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#1.6.1) the Buddha
    is at Pāvā in the Mallian lands, and the discourse is
    spoken by Sāriputta there. Given the evident lateness
    of DN 33, this is a less convincing framework. A parallel to MN 104
    (MA 196 at T i 752c12) says he was in the Vajjian lands at the time;
    both Sakya and Vajji border on Mallā. Jain tradition
    holds Mahāvīra died after the Buddha, and it was at a
    different Pāvā in Magadha near Nāḷandā,
    perhaps the place known in Pali as Pāvārika's mango
    grove ([DN 11:1.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn11/en/sujato#1.2)).
    The earliest Jain source for Mahāvīra's death, the
    Kalpasutra, is, however, much later than the Buddhist sources, and
    does not say where Pāvā is. But it does say the events
    were commemorated by the rulers of Kāsī and Kosala, and
    the Mallians and the Licchavīs. The absence of Magadha
    and the presence of Malla sit better with the location of
    Pāvā in Malla rather than Magadha.

[^192]: While this description of the Jains might seem like sheer
    sectarian calumny, it is a fact that the Jain tradition is split
    into two sects, the "sky-clad" Digambara, whose male ascetics went
    naked, and the "white-clad" Śvetāmbara who wear an
    unstitched cloth. Jain tradition holds that the split occurred about
    a century later, in the reign of Candragupta Maurya.

[^193]: A slight on the movement whose signature virtue was
    non-violence.

[^194]: "With broken monument" (*bhinnathupe*) is used only in this
    context. When a great teacher or leader died, a "monument" was built
    to keep their memory alive. The breaking of a monument---whether
    physical or symbolic---was, in a way, truly killing them.

[^195]: Cunda took the time to complete his rains residence before
    conveying the news, reminding us of the speed with which news
    traveled in those days---slowly. \| Apart from the events described
    here, we hear of Sāma only once ([AN
    6.21](https://suttacentral.net/an6.21/en/sujato)). The topic there
    is the decline of the Saṅgha, hinting at a connection
    with these events.

[^196]: This harsh critique is repeated at [DN
    33:1.7.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#1.7.4), but not at
    [MN 104:5.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn104/en/sujato#5.1), where
    the Buddha's response focuses on his own community.

[^197]: Normally we find *vokkamma* ("having turned away") in the sense
    of straying from the Dhamma. But this passage shows the phrase is,
    in itself, neutral, as it is good to turn from a bad teaching.

[^198]: The Dhamma is primary, not the teacher. This is applied to
    Buddhism as well; for example, a student is expected to help a
    mentor who is falling away from Dhamma ([Kd
    1:25.20.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#25.20.1)).

[^199]: Compare [AN 1.320](https://suttacentral.net/an1.320/en/sujato).

[^200]: "Collected sayings" is *saṅgāhapada*. This is a
    unique term, but the sense seems to be that the process of gathering
    and organizing teachings is incomplete. I take the negative *na* to
    be distributed separately among the clauses.

[^201]: Compare [DN
    16:3.8.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#3.8.4)ff.

[^202]: One of the Brahmanical sages under whom the Bodhisatta practiced
    before awakening ([MN
    26:16.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn26/en/sujato#16.1)). Another of
    his enigmatic sayings is found at [SN
    35.103:1.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.103/en/sujato#1.2). When
    the Bodhisatta began his study, he first learned to recite the
    scriptures, and in these two passages we find examples of what those
    scriptures were.

[^203]: Sharp razors were known even in Vedic times (Rig Veda 8.4.16).

[^204]: This is a distorted reference to Bṛhadāraṇyaka
    Upaniṣad 1.4.7. There, the Self is said to be hidden in
    a body like a razor in its case. People do not see it
    (*taṁ na paśyanti*), for they only see the
    partial and incomplete functions of the Self, such as breathing,
    speaking, and so on. Seeing only the aspects, they do not see that
    each aspect is an expression of the one whole. This confirms that
    Uddaka was a Brahmanical teacher who was familiar with this passage.
    Similar phrases, but without the razor simile, are found at
    Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.23 and
    Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.12.1.

[^205]: "Recite in concert" is *saṅgīti*. Reciting together
    affirms the mutual teaching and ensures the correctness of the text.
    The implication is that the entire Buddhist community participates,
    but in the *saṅgīti* after the Buddha's death there
    were only monks.

[^206]: Here the Buddha outlines the topics to be recited, which are the
    main chapters of the Saṁyutta Nikāya.

[^207]: The "meaning" is the *attha*. Here we see the source of the
    *atthakathā*, which we translate as "commentaries", but
    which are literally "discussions on the meaning". Such discussions
    are undertaken through a civil and polite inquiry.

[^208]: Meaning and phrasing are interdependent, so care must be taken
    with both. Often it happens that when the phrasing slips, a new and
    unwarranted meaning is imputed.

[^209]: These are the four basic requisites for monastics, said to
    overcome defilements by usage ([AN
    6.58:4.1](https://suttacentral.net/an6.58/en/sujato#4.1), [MN
    2:13.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn2/en/sujato#13.1)).

[^210]: This repurposes the phrase used right at the beginning of the
    Buddha's first teaching, the Dhammacakkappavattasutta ([SN
    56.11:2.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11/en/sujato#2.3)). There
    he was persuading hard-bitten ascetics that he did not indulge in
    sensual pleasures. While the affiliation of those five ascetics is
    not stated explicitly, clearly their practices were similar to the
    Jains. And given the context, no doubt the Buddha has the Jains in
    mind here.

[^211]: Again echoing the first sermon ([SN
    56.11:3.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11/en/sujato#3.1)), here
    the Buddha places the *jhānas* where, in the
    Dhammacakkappavattasutta, he put the middle way. He uses a similar
    strategy at [DN
    28:19.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn28/en/sujato#19.2).

[^212]: Some meditation teachers warn of the supposed dangers of
    becoming attached to the pleasure of meditation. The Buddha's view
    was that the pleasure of meditation arises from letting go and leads
    to Nibbana.

[^213]: At [AN 8.19:3.1](https://suttacentral.net/an8.19/en/sujato#3.1)
    the ocean is said to be *ṭhitadhammo*, "naturally
    stable". Both places are glossed as *ṭhitasabhāvā*. It
    seems this is in reference to the fact that the Buddhist Vinaya is
    gentle and flexible. The Buddha was ready to alter and adjust
    details when circumstances required, yet the fundamental principles
    hold firm.

[^214]: As at [AN
    9.7:3.3](https://suttacentral.net/an9.7/en/sujato#3.3), etc.

[^215]: It is possible to remember the past, but knowledge of the future
    is restricted to inferences in specific contexts and cannot be
    predicted in general.

[^216]: The Buddha claims no gift of prophecy, unlike some other sages,
    but he knows that which matters.

[^217]: See [AN 4.23](https://suttacentral.net/an4.23/en/sujato) and
    [Iti 112](https://suttacentral.net/iti112/en/sujato).

[^218]: Here these questions follow on from the Buddha's acknowledgment
    of epistemological limitations. Not everything can be known, and if
    it is, it is not always useful to speak of it.

[^219]: In the Brahmajālasutta ([DN
    1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato)).

[^220]: The Brahmajālasutta describes the path to the end
    of these views in terms of understanding dependent origination
    through contemplation of contact in the six senses ([DN
    1:3.71.12](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#3.71.12)). The
    Buddhist path is integrated, so one part always implies the whole.

[^221]: This is one of the latest suttas in the Pali
    Nikāyas. Typically this topic only comes up in relation
    to the Buddha's fulfillment of Brahmanical prophecies. Here it is
    developed with a series of ornate verses, none of which have
    parallels. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that nowhere in the
    extensive discussions of the Buddha's past good deeds is there any
    mention of the later concepts of the *pāramīs*
    ("perfections") or the Bodhisatta path.

[^222]: The marks are elsewhere listed in [DN
    14:1.32.7](https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#1.32.7) and [MN
    91:9.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn91/en/sujato#9.1). I discuss the
    translation of the marks in my comments to DN 14.

[^223]: The later astrological texts such as the
    Gārgīyajyotiṣa and Bṛhatsaṁhitā that
    discuss similar marks are more concerned with how they indicate
    character and destiny than their moral causes.

[^224]: The key terms here are *daḷha* ("firm") and
    *avatthita* ("persistently"), which result in his firm stance.

[^225]: K.R. Norman's series of five articles on *The Metres of the
    Lakkhaṇa-suttanta* discusses the verses in detail, and
    my translation is indebted to him. He notes that the 20 verse
    passages employ no less than seven distinct metres, all of them
    either new or updated styles. Such a display of poetic virtuosity is
    rare in the Pali canon.

[^226]: The commentary confirms the Mahāsaṅgīti reading
    *khambhana* ("obstacle") here rather than PTS *gabbha* ('womb").

[^227]: He "conveyed happiness" (*sukhāvaho*), like a
    wheeled cart would convey goods. \| *Parivāra* means
    "surroundings, accompaniments", and I follow the commentary, which
    takes it in the sense of the "trimmings" accompanying the food.
    Given, however, that the kammic result is a large
    *parivāra* ("following"), it might mean that he gave
    not just physical things, but was generous with his followers also,
    engaging them in such beneficial tasks.

[^228]: This refers to the late legend of the soothsayers seeing the
    baby Siddhattha, and as such *kumāra* should be taken
    as "prince".

[^229]: Giving up killing results in long life. This seems to be applied
    by metaphor to having these long and elegant body parts.

[^230]: Whereas in the phrase *brahmujugatto*, *brahm-* means "extended,
    tall", here *brahmāva* means "like
    Brahmā", either as a play on words or by mistaken
    etymology.

[^231]: This verse spoken by the soothsayers.

[^232]: He receives bodily fullness as a result of giving food.

[^233]: "Tender" because he treated people tenderly; "serried" because
    his fingers and toes are kept gracefully together, not splayed and
    separated.

[^234]: "Inclusive and well-managed" renders *saṅgahita*.
    It means "included", as in those people who, due to the kindly
    actions, feel that they belong. For the sense "well-managed" see [AN
    8.49:2.3](https://suttacentral.net/an8.49/en/sujato#2.3). Because of
    acting kindly and inclusively, people are well-disposed and work
    well together.

[^235]: Even though the community is geographically dispersed, it is
    still coherent.

[^236]: Perhaps the uprightness of these marks relates to his speech
    being beneficial, leading upwards.

[^237]: It seems that his "swift" teaching techniques evoke the
    antelope.

[^238]: Read *anomanikkamo*.

[^239]: Asking questions leads to wisdom, and the mind of wisdom does
    not get attached.

[^240]: Giving fine coverings leads to fine skin. Less obviously, anger
    is said to lead to discoloring and ugliness.

[^241]: For this positive sense of *adhiṭṭhahi* compare [AN
    6.52:8.2](https://suttacentral.net/an6.52/en/sujato#8.2) and [MN
    140:11.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn140/en/sujato#11.1).

[^242]: There's a play on *abhivissaji* ("gave away") and *abhivassa*
    ("pouring rain").

[^243]: *Kanaka*, one of the many Indic words for gold, is from the same
    Proto-Indo European root as the English word "honey".

[^244]: Here *mokkha* = *pāmokkha* ("chief, best").

[^245]: The penis is the generative organ and hence part-creator of
    family. Being covered suggests that his sexuality was moderated and
    contained. His role was more than having children, it was building
    family.

[^246]: The banyan tree is not just proportioned, it offers shelter to
    many creatures. Touching the knees indicates connecting with the
    manyfolk, who at [AN
    5.196:3.1](https://suttacentral.net/an5.196/en/sujato#3.1) are
    likened to caterpillars reaching the knees.

[^247]: A *khema* is a sanctuary where animals flourish in peace,
    without fear of the hunter. Likewise, the Buddha's body flourishes
    and has a fullness to it. He is slim but not skinny.

[^248]: Decline in *dhamma* is missing here, but present both above and
    below in verse.

[^249]: The "ridged taste buds" are not merely for tasting, but support
    excellent digestion. Kammically, the rationale is that since he did
    not kill others, now nothing hurts him when he eats.

[^250]: Dark colored eyes give the impression of wide pupils and an open
    gaze, while the eyelashes of cows lend them a tenderness.

[^251]: *Abhiyogino* ("soothsayers") is a unique term, explained by the
    commentary, "they are dedicated to the lore of marks".

[^252]: The commentary says he took the lead in good deeds
    "unembarrassed, with head held high, his head filled with rapture
    and joy".

[^253]: One hair per pore, because his words of truth have only one
    meaning. Likewise, the tuft conveys purity and integrity.

[^254]: The number four connotes "all around, complete, universal",
    primarily from the four directions. It is multiplied to eight with
    the intermediate directions, and ten including above and below.
    Forty, then, is four times ten, a number of super-inclusiveness or
    super-universality. The lack of gaps corresponds with the lack of
    division between his followers.

[^255]: The commentary explains that those who flap their mouths with
    nonsensical gossip end up with weak or misshapen jaws.

[^256]: His teeth are not "crooked" or "stained" by corruption.

[^257]: The commentary explain *akhilamanimittamakaṇṭakaṁ*
    as "free of bandits" (*niccoraṁ*).

[^258]: Sigālaka only appears in this sutta. His name means
    "little jackal".

[^259]: Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5.5.1 recommends offerings to
    Agni in the east, Indra or Soma in the south, the All-gods in the
    west, Mitra and Varuṇa in the north, and
    Bṛhaspati in the middle. The quarters themselves are
    divine, since one can travel them and never reach the end
    (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.1.5). Atharva
    Veda 12.3.7--10 gives a domestic prayer for the quarters; here Yama
    dwells in the south with the Fathers, while Soma is in the west, and
    the other directions are not associated with specific deities.
    Maitrī Upaniṣad 7.1--6 details the
    spiritual meanings of the six quarters. In Buddhism, the quarters
    are said to be inhabited by the respective Four Great Kings as per
    [DN 32](https://suttacentral.net/dn32/en/sujato).

[^260]: Sigālaka followed blindly without considering the
    meaning as urged by Chāndogya Upaniṣad
    1.3.11.

[^261]: It is unusual to find "six" directions. Normally it is four,
    then eight (with intermediate directions), then ten (above and
    below). Praśna Upaniṣad 1.6 lists the six,
    then the intermediates.

[^262]: The Buddha outlines the contents of the discourse to follow.

[^263]: The teaching is structured to reinforce memorization. Give the
    number of items (twice), so you will notice if any are missing; list
    the items; recapitulate the numbers; then recapitulate the items
    once more in verse.

[^264]: First we learned what the bad deeds were, now we learn why
    people do them.

[^265]: "Drains on wealth" is *apāyamukha*, literally
    "openings for departure". This is emphasized here since
    Sigālaka wants to be a good son and not squander the
    family fortune.

[^266]: The most common phrase in Pali for alcoholic beverages lists
    three items. *Surā* is brewed from grains with yeast
    ([Bu Pc
    51:2.1.2](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51/en/sujato#2.1.2))
    *Meraya* is made from flowers, fruits, or sugars ([Bu Pc
    51:2.1.4](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51/en/sujato#2.1.4)).
    *Madya* is apparently a catchall. Together they correspond fairly
    well with the modern classification of alcoholic drinks as "beer,
    wine, and liquor". See also Manu 11.94, Arthaśāstra
    2.25, Suśrutasaṁhitā 1.45,
    Amarakośodghāṭana 3.6.

[^267]: Now each of the six drains on wealth are expanded and explained.

[^268]: *Vārunī* is said to have been distilled from
    hogweed with palm sap, "toddy".

[^269]: Assume *vāruṇī* is a truncated instrumental.

[^270]: *Kāhiti* is third person singular future of
    *karoti*.

[^271]: The subcommentary explains *atthā* as
    *dhanā* ("riches").

[^272]: Having explained the six drains on wealth, the Buddha moves on
    to the next item in the table of contents.

[^273]: Parents are in the east because that is where the sun is born.
    Tutors are to the south (*dakkhiṇā*) as they are owed
    an offering (*dakkhiṇā*). Family is one's legacy, so
    they lie with the setting sun in the west. Good friends keep you on
    the upright way to the north. Servants support you and make your
    life possible, like the earth below. And spiritual teachers lead you
    to heaven or transcendence above.

[^274]: "Protection in every region" (*disāsu
    parittāṇaṁ*) refers to when the student has completed
    their studies and goes off to travel, the teacher does what they can
    to ensure their safety in other regions.

[^275]: Marriage is based on mutual care and respect, not on dominance
    and obedience.

[^276]: This discourse bears similarities to the
    Mahāsamayasutta ([DN
    20](https://suttacentral.net/dn20/en/sujato)). Thematically, that
    discourse is about the devotion of the deities, whereas this is
    about protection for the mendicants. \| I believe this is only place
    in whole canon that lists the *bhāṇavāra* at the start.

[^277]: Here Kuvera is called Vessavaṇa, which our text
    below explains as being derived from the name of his city.

[^278]: "Protection" is *rakkhā*, which is a synonym of
    *paritta*.

[^279]: For these verses, I lean heavily on the translation by
    Ānandajoti, *[The Āṭānāṭiya
    Discourse](https://suttacentral.nethttps://www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net/Texts-and-Translations/Safeguard/03-Tatiyakabhanavaram.htm)*.
    They are commonly recited in Theravada countries today. The recital
    begins with the seven Buddhas, for which see [DN
    14](https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato).

[^280]: Here Aṅgīrasa is used as a name rather than a
    descriptive epithet. Aṅgīras was one of the Vedic sages
    and the Aṅgīrasas are his descendants.
    Aṅgīras is regarded as the *pravara* or revered
    ancestor of the Gotama clan. Both names are associated with light:
    *aṅgīrasa* shares a root and is often synonymous with
    *agni* ("fire"), while *gotama* means "light dispelling dark".

[^281]: Here begins a series of verses dedicated to the divinities in
    each of the four quarters, proceeding in the standard way: east,
    south, west, north.

[^282]: This is according to the commentary (*taṁ
    rahadaṁ tattha evaṁ
    jānanti*).

[^283]: This relates back to the basic problem facing the *yakkhas*:
    shame. They know what they do is wrong, but they like it and hence
    feel shame when hearing the Dhamma. But the Buddha treats them with
    respect, without shaming or bias, and thus is able to lead them to
    the good. The commentary implicitly connects this line with [DN
    30:2.1.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn30/en/sujato#2.1.2), where the
    Buddha "examines" (*samekkhati*) the population for their individual
    and shared traits.

[^284]: The south has the shortest and least auspicious description. To
    the extent that it relates to physical geography, this echoes the
    perception of northerners at the time that the south of India lay
    outside the "civilized" realms (*āryāvarta*).

[^285]: The description of the west mirrors the east.

[^286]: The description of the north is by far the most elaborate. \|
    "Uttarakuru" is literally "north Kuru". It is mentioned in Sanskrit
    and Greek literature, where it sometimes appears as an actual
    country and other times as a place of fantasy. Attempts to locate it
    in a specific region in or beyond the Himalayas have proven
    inconclusive.

[^287]: Meru is another place that appears sometimes as a physical
    mountain and other times purely mystical. As home of the gods ([Snp
    3.11:4.3](https://suttacentral.net/snp3.11/en/sujato#4.3)), its peak
    is accessible only by psychic powers ([Thig
    14.1:19.3](https://suttacentral.net/thig14.1/en/sujato#19.3), [MN
    50:30.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn50/en/sujato#30.1)). It is the
    center of the world in Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain cosmologies. Today
    it is sometimes identified with Mount Kailash.

[^288]: This agrees with the description at [AN
    9.21:1.3](https://suttacentral.net/an9.21/en/sujato#1.3).

[^289]: Due to their lack of selfishness, they live in a kinder state of
    nature, which we selfish humans have lost ([DN
    27:16.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn27/en/sujato#16.1)).

[^290]: *Tuṇḍikīre* is explained by the commentary as
    "firestone". In the notes to his translation, Walshe suggests a
    relation with tandoor, which has been found as far back as the Indus
    Valley Civilization, a millennium before the Buddha.

[^291]: Cloven and uncloven was an important classification of animals
    in the Dharmaśāstras.

[^292]: The commentary says they were mostly carried on the backs of
    pregnant women (!). But the verb *anuyanti* indicates, rather, that
    they were "drawn along after", which suggests a rickshaw.

[^293]: The discourse is named after the first of these cities. The name
    is hard to explain, but all the names in this series have the
    element *nāṭa*, which is probably the name of the
    people. One meaning of *nāṭa* is "dance", and one of
    the unique features of this discourse is that each of the Four Great
    Kings is said to delight in song and dance. There is a long history
    of dancing divinities in India, and images of dancers go back as far
    as the Indus Valley Civilization. If we take *nāṭa* in
    the sense "the people of the dance", *kusināṭā* would
    therefore be "dancers of the grass" after the *kusa* grass essential
    to the Vedic rites of kingship. *Parakusināṭā* is the
    "further dancers of the grass", and *parakusiṭanāṭā* is
    probably a variation on that. *Nāṭapuriyā* is the
    "citadel of the dancers". Each of these associates the people of the
    dance with the idea of protection or authority, agreeing with the
    context, where the cities are said to belong to a great king. Thus
    the prefix *āṭā-* probably stems from
    *tāṇa* ("shelter, refuge"; the same root as *paritta*),
    in the sense of the "refuge of the dancers".

[^294]: Adopt the reading *nāṭapuriyā* found in
    Sinhalese-script manuscripts against the Mahāsaṅgīti's
    *nāṭasuriyā*.

[^295]: "Abounding in monkeys".

[^296]: "Flood of folk".

[^297]: *Navanavutiya* is "the city of the ninety-nine" i.e. three times
    thirty-three. \| *Ambara* is "sky".

[^298]: Also encountered at [DN
    17:1.3.8](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato#1.3.8) and [DN
    16:5.18.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#5.18.5).
    Alakā is the capital of Kuvera in Sanskrit sources.

[^299]: The city Visāṇa is not encountered elsewhere, but
    it means "horn", possibly reinforcing the importance of "song and
    dance".

[^300]: These three names appear to be purely onomatopoeic, perhaps
    echoing musical sounds.

[^301]: These names suggest a connection with sustenance: "Nutritive",
    "Powerful", "Nourished by That".

[^302]: These are a set of associated solar names. Ariṭṭha
    and Nemi appear compounded in Sanskrit, Ariṣṭanemi,
    which evokes the powerful chariot of a conqueror ("indestructible
    rim", Rig Veda 1.89.6, 1.180.10, 3.53.17, 10.178.1). It was the name
    of the 22nd Jain *tīrthaṅkara*, and in Brahmanical
    texts of several figures, including a dragon
    (Mahābhārata 1.59.39a, 1114.62a, etc.) and an Asura
    king (Bhāgavatapurāṇa 8.6.31, 8.10.10). Along with the
    divine steed Tārkṣya, he is associated with
    Garuḍa, and was probably originally an epithet for the
    unstoppable wheel of the Sun, Sūra. This line, then,
    while a simple list of four names in Pali, appears to be a
    fragmented memory of a Vedic conception which might be translated:
    "King Sun, (the wheel) of indestructible rim".

[^303]: *Dharaṇī* the "bearer" is also a pregnant woman or
    Mother Earth.

[^304]: *Sāla* means "hall" or "sal tree", but the
    commentary says it was surrounded by creepers of that name.

[^305]: *Kuḷīrakā* appears to be the name of a crab-eating
    bird (*kuḷīra*). In honor of my native country, I name
    it after the kookaburra, which eats crabs and is renowned for its
    cry.

[^306]: In [Ja
    547:426.2](https://suttacentral.net/ja547/en/sujato#426.2) we find
    *koṭṭhā pokkharasātakā*, where the
    *koṭṭha* is evidently a woodpecker. *Satapatta* can
    mean woodpecker or lotus (or crane or peacock), and perhaps there is
    an association here, the "hundred-leaved \[bird\] of the lotus
    pond".

[^307]: For these gods, see my comment on [DN
    13:25.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn13/en/sujato#25.2). Here I will
    comment on the names not discussed elsewhere, especially in [DN
    20](https://suttacentral.net/dn20/en/sujato).

[^308]: This is presumably Bharadvāja
    Bārhaspatya, the rishi ancestor of the
    Bhāradvāja clan, many members of which are encountered
    in the suttas. It is unusual to find him listed along with the
    primary Vedic gods. The Bhāradvāja verses are mostly
    collected in the sixth book of the Rig Veda, where they show a
    special devotion to the god Pūṣan.

[^309]: These deities appear nowhere else. *Puṇṇaka* is
    "full", *guḷa* is "lump", and *karatiya* is unclear
    ("bean-like"?).

[^310]: The *yakkha* Sivaka ("blissful, auspicious") helped
    Anāthapiṇḍika visit the Buddha ([SN
    10.8:1.12](https://suttacentral.net/sn10.8/en/sujato#1.12)); he is
    possibly to be identified with Shiva. \| The dragon king Mucalinda
    sheltered the Buddha after his awakening ([Ud
    2.1:2.2](https://suttacentral.net/ud2.1/en/sujato#2.2)).

[^311]: *Yugandhara* is the tutelary deity of the mountain of that name.

[^312]: *Gopāla* is "cowherd", an epithet of both Krishna
    and Shiva.\| *Suppagedha* (or *supparodha*) is obscure.

[^313]: "Shame", "conduit" (or "craving"), and "stupidity" seem like odd
    companions.

[^314]: A saying by Pañcālacaṇḍa at [SN
    2.7](https://suttacentral.net/sn2.7/en/sujato) is quoted by
    Udāyī and explained by Ānanda at [AN
    9.42](https://suttacentral.net/an9.42/en/sujato). He would appear to
    be the wrathful (*caṇḍa*) protector of the
    Pañcāla clan, but a Pañcālacanda appears
    as a brahmin teacher at Aitereya Āraṇyaka 3.1.6. \|
    Āḷavaka is the tutelary deity of Āḷavī
    ([SN 10.12](https://suttacentral.net/sn10.12/en/sujato), [Snp
    1.10](https://suttacentral.net/snp1.10/en/sujato)).

[^315]: *Sumana* is "Happyheart", *sumukha* is "Fairface".

[^316]: *Dadhimukha* is "Milkface", and in the Mahābhārata
    is a name of a dragon. \| *Maṇi* is "gem". \|
    *Māṇivara* is "fine gem", although the commentary takes
    this as two names. \| Dīgha is identified by the
    commentary with Dīgha Parajana of [MN
    31:21.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn31/en/sujato#21.1).

[^317]: *Serīsaka* means "of *sirīsa* wood",
    perhaps the tutelary deity of a forest.

[^318]: This discourse picks up from [DN
    29:17.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato#17.1), where the
    Buddha urges that the Sangha should gather and recite the Dhamma for
    the long lasting of the dispensation. There he lists the 37 factors
    of awakening, a standard early collation of practice-oriented
    teachings that are primarily collected in the Mahāvagga
    of the Saṁyutta Nikāya. This discourse is
    a late one, and appears to be an initial attempt to compile a more
    thorough list of the Buddha's teachings. The
    Sarvāstivāda version of the same discourse formed the
    basis of one of their seven Abhidhamma books, the
    Sangītiparyāya.

[^319]: At [AN 10.176](https://suttacentral.net/an10.176/en/sujato)
    Cunda asks about the purity of the western brahmins; at [DN
    16:4.13.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#4.13.5) = [Ud
    8.5](https://suttacentral.net/ud8.5/en/sujato) he offers the
    Buddha's last meal; at [Snp
    1.5](https://suttacentral.net/snp1.5/en/sujato) he asks about a true
    ascetic.

[^320]: The completion of a town hall was celebrated by a talk for the
    Sakyans [SN
    35.243:1.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.243/en/sujato#1.2) and [MN
    53:2.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn53/en/sujato#2.1). Such halls
    were community meeting places that played a central role in civic
    society and communal decision-making in democratic republics such as
    the Mallas and the Sakyans. The Buddha's participation is a sign of
    his support for their civic and democratic process.

[^321]: As at [DN
    16:5.19.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#5.19.2), the
    Mallas are called Vāseṭṭhas after the family lineage of
    their priest (*purohita*).

[^322]: The Buddha likewise mentions his bad back and invites another
    monk to teach in both the other suttas where he is first to teach in
    a new hall ([MN
    53:5.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn53/en/sujato#5.3), [SN
    35.243:3.4](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.243/en/sujato#3.4)), and
    also on the *uposatha* at Naḷakapāna ([AN
    10.67](https://suttacentral.net/an10.67/en/sujato), [AN
    10.68](https://suttacentral.net/an10.68/en/sujato)). These were all
    occasions when the community was sitting late into the night.

[^323]: As at [DN 29:1.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato#1.3)
    and [MN 104:2.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn104/en/sujato#2.1), in
    both of which the Buddha was in the Sakyan lands at this time.
    There, the news is conveyed to the Buddha by the novice Cunda.
    Perhaps he was confused with Cunda the smith.

[^324]: Sāriputta adopts the "Aṅguttara
    principle" of arranging teachings by number rather than the
    "Saṁyutta principle" of arrangement by topic. Thus this
    list of teachings has more in common with the Aṅguttara
    Nikāya than with the Buddha's original list of
    Saṁyutta topics. I note unusual or rare terms, but the
    references here are meant to be indicative rather than
    comprehensive.

[^325]: [AN
    10.27:10.5](https://suttacentral.net/an10.27/en/sujato#10.5), [AN
    10.28:4.5](https://suttacentral.net/an10.28/en/sujato#4.5), [Kp
    4:1.2](https://suttacentral.net/kp4/en/sujato#1.2).

[^326]: This phrase is unique, but here *saṅkhārā*
    ("conditions") is a synonym of *āhāra* ("food, fuel,
    nutriment").

[^327]: The paucity of teachings of "one" reflects the fact that the
    Aṅguttara Nikāya Ones consists mostly of
    longer teachings that have been split into atoms to artificially
    create "ones".

    *paggahanimitta* at [AN
    3.102](https://suttacentral.net/an3.102/en/sujato).

[^337]: "Knowledge of ending" (*khaye ñāṇaṁ*) refers to the
    aggregates; it is discussed at [SN
    12.23](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.23/en/sujato). \| "Knowledge of
    non-arising" (*anuppāde ñāṇaṁ*) is the
    knowledge that one will not be born again.

[^339]: At [AN 4.33:2.2](https://suttacentral.net/an4.33/en/sujato#2.2)
    cessation is the middle, not an extreme. But [SN
    22.103](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.103/en/sujato) has four
    extremes.

    [SN 45.165:1.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.165/en/sujato#1.3).

[^341]: The "right way" is the eightfold path, the "wrong way" the
    opposite ([SN 45.21](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.21/en/sujato).
    "Surety in the right way" is mentioned often (eg. [AN
    5.151](https://suttacentral.net/an5.151/en/sujato)), but "surety in
    the wrong way" seems to be found only in later texts. "Lack of
    surety" is impermanence. And elsewhere these are not said to be
    "heaps".

[^342]: Despite the explanation, and the prevalence of reading
    *kaṅkhā*, the commentary requires the
    Mahāsaṅgīti reading *tama*.

    established in a hearth to the south.

[^345]: Elsewhere found only in Abhidhamma. "Visible and resistant"
    refers to material phenomena perceivable by the eye. "Invisible and
    resistant" is a shorthand for material phenomena that are not
    perceivable by the eye, but which nonetheless impinge on other
    senses, such as sounds or smells. "Invisible and non-resistant"
    includes form perceived solely in the mind.

[^346]: The last item is elsewhere found only in Abhidhamma texts. A
    "trainee" is a noble one who has at least entered the path to
    stream-entry; an "adept" (*asekkha*) has completed their training;
    one who is neither is yet to begin.

[^356]: This threefold presentation of the process of absorption focuses
    on *vitakka* ("placing the mind") and *vicāra*
    ("keeping it connected"), looking closely at how they cease (see
    also [DN 34:1.4.7](https://suttacentral.net/dn34/en/sujato#1.4.7),

    8.63:3.1](https://suttacentral.net/an8.63/en/sujato#3.1)). The
    standard *jhāna* formula focuses more on the refinement
    of feelings, from which perspective the first two stages of
    immersion here fall under the "rapture and bliss born of seclusion",
    while only the third qualifies as "rapture and bliss born of
    immersion". Thus Analayo describes the two descriptions' as
    "complementary perspectives on the same process of deepening
    concentration" (*Comparative Study*, vol. ii, pg. 739, note 263).

[^397]: [AN 4.198](https://suttacentral.net/an4.198/en/sujato). \| "With
    self become divine" (*brahmabhūtena
    attanā*) deliberately echoes Upaniṣadic
    language. Pali is sometimes said to lack reference to the cosmic
    Brahman (in neuter), having only the personal Brahmā
    (in masculine). The grammatical case of *brahma-* in the compound
    here is undetermined, yet no scholar of Sanskrit would hesitate to
    interpret the common phrase *brahmabhūtātmā* in the
    sense "self become one with the cosmic divinity Brahman". Surely the
    Pali draws from the same sense, using it to describe
    Nibbāna.

[^433]: Primarily a Vinaya topic ([Kd

    but also found at [AN

[^434]: This and the next at [AN
    8.80](https://suttacentral.net/an8.80/en/sujato).

[^435]: These are just called "gifts" at [AN
    8.31](https://suttacentral.net/an8.31/en/sujato). The "reasons to
    give" at [AN 8.33](https://suttacentral.net/an8.33/en/sujato) are
    different.

[^436]: See [MN 120:3.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn120/en/sujato#3.4)
    and [AN 8.35:1.8](https://suttacentral.net/an8.35/en/sujato#1.8).

[^437]: "Settled for less" also occurs at [AN
    8.35:1.9](https://suttacentral.net/an8.35/en/sujato#1.9). Readings
    vary between *hīne vimuttaṁ* ("released in
    what is inferior", per MS) and *hīne
    'dhimuttaṁ* ("resolved upon what is inferior"). This is
    an example of an ambiguity between *vi + √muc* ("release") and
    *adhi + √muc* ("resolve") that is sometimes seen in Pali texts. The
    subcommentary reads *vimuttaṁ* and offers two
    explanations: "'Released' (*vimuttaṁ*) means 'resolved'
    (*adhimuttaṁ*); the meaning is slants, slopes, and
    inclines. Or else 'released' means 'set free'
    (*vissaṭṭhaṁ*)." Given that it is clearly accepted in
    the commentarial tradition, and that it is the more difficult
    reading, it seems we must accept *vimuttaṁ* as the
    correct reading here. But from context, and from the subcommentary,
    it has the same sense as *adhimutta*, namely, "resolved upon". This
    goes some way to explaining the ambiguity between the two words, as
    they not only have a similar form, but their meanings can overlap
    too.

[^438]: Notice that they have "seen" the well-to-do brahmins or
    aristocrats, but have only "heard of" the various deities.

[^439]: Previous rebirths required only ethics. Rebirth in the
    Brahmā realm, however, requires the freedom of the mind
    from hindrances through practicing absorption.

[^447]: Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.3.10 warns
    that, because the knowledge of the gods have not reached them, the
    lands beyond the borders are the domain of death.

[^448]: Eight at [AN 8.29](https://suttacentral.net/an8.29/en/sujato)
    and [DN
    34:2.1.122](https://suttacentral.net/dn34/en/sujato#2.1.122); the
    ninth here is made by adding the *asura* rebirth.

[^450]: [AN 9.61](https://suttacentral.net/an9.61/en/sujato).

[^451]: The pre-Buddhist sense of *sati* is "memory", while
    "mindfulness" evolved from the practice of "remembering" scripture,
    creating an uninterrupted flow state in the present. In this sense,
    mindfulness can be understood as the element of continuity that
    knits consciousness together in a coherent stream. Thus when
    practicing "mindfulness of breathing" one pays continuous attention
    to the breaths, not "forgetting" what one is doing.

[^452]: [AN 10.17](https://suttacentral.net/an10.17/en/sujato), [AN

[^453]: [AN 10.25](https://suttacentral.net/an10.25/en/sujato).
    *Kaṣina* means "universal", "totality", and it refers
    to a measureless state of *jhāna*. In later usage it
    became a term for a physical object, such as a disk, on which a
    meditator focused, but it never has this meaning in early texts.
    Yājñavalkya says that, just as salt is "entirely"
    salty, the Self is an "entire mass of consciousness"
    (*kṛtsnaḥ prajñānaghana eva*,
    Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.5.13).

[^455]: [AN 10.112](https://suttacentral.net/an10.112/en/sujato).

[^456]: As in [DN 4](https://suttacentral.net/dn4/en/sujato).

[^457]: This discourse is similar to [DN
    33](https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato); seventy items are
    shared between the two. Here Sāriputta teaches without
    prompting. The scheme is more rigorous; items listed according to a
    specific pattern, then the same pattern is amplified one by one. The
    constraints of this scheme mean that, while almost all the items
    listed here are found elsewhere, they are mostly not known by the
    name used here. This sutta seems a little later than [DN
    33](https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato), but such conclusions
    should be drawn cautiously; in at least one detail, the absence of
    the *asura* realm from the "lost opportunities", the passage here is
    earlier.

[^458]: The use of a verse to introduce the teachings is unusual.

[^459]: This echoes Chāndogya Upaniṣad 7.26.2,
    *sarvagranthīnāṁ vipramokṣaḥ*.

[^460]: Each number from one to ten follows this same scheme.

    is the five aggregates rather than contact.

[^464]: This term is only found in the Ratanasutta ([Snp
    2.1:5.2](https://suttacentral.net/snp2.1/en/sujato#5.2)). It means a
    kind of meditation that results in the realization of the Dhamma in
    this very life.

[^472]: A different group of five factors of immersion is at [AN
    5.28](https://suttacentral.net/an5.28/en/sujato); the final factor
    is the same in both. The first four factors, however, appear only as
    part of this same group in later texts ([Ne

    extra possibility, rebirth among the titans, making nine in all.

[^475]: The negative is absent from the text due to abbreviation, so it
    is inferred from the parallel passage at [DN
    33:3.2.69](https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#3.2.69).

    exact sequence appears to be unique.

[^478]: Four are found at [AN
    4.194](https://suttacentral.net/an4.194/en/sujato). Seven, phrased
    slightly differently, are found at [MN

    completes the path and practice of the Buddha.
