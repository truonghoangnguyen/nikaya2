# DN 32 The Āṭānāṭiya Protection  *Āṭānāṭiyasutta*

## 1. The First Recitation Section

So I have heard.[^276] At one time the Buddha was staying
near Rājagaha, on the Vulture's Peak Mountain. Then, late
at night, the four great kings---with large armies of spirits, centaurs,
goblins, and dragons---set guards, troops, and wards at the four
quarters and then, lighting up the entire Vulture's Peak with their
beauty, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Before
sitting down to one side, some spirits bowed, some exchanged greetings
and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the
Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.

Seated to one side, the Great King Vessavaṇa said to the
Buddha,[^277] "Sir, some high spirits have confidence in the Buddha,
some do not. Some middling spirits have confidence in the Buddha, some
do not. Some low spirits have confidence in the Buddha, some do not. But
mostly the spirits don't have confidence in the Buddha. Why is that?
Because the Buddha teaches them to refrain from killing living
creatures, stealing, lying, sexual misconduct, and consuming beer, wine,
and liquor intoxicants. But mostly they don't refrain from such things.
They don't like that or approve of it.

Sir, there are disciples of the Buddha who frequent remote lodgings in
the wilderness and the forest that are quiet and still, far from the
madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat. There
dwell high spirits who have no confidence in the Buddha's dispensation.
To give them confidence, may the Buddha please learn the
Āṭānāṭiya protection for the guarding, protection, safety,
and comfort of the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen." The Buddha
consented with silence.

Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, on that occasion Great King
Vessavaṇa recited the Āṭānāṭiya
protection.[^278]

This, dear sir, is the Āṭānāṭiya protection for the
guarding, protection, safety, and comfort of the monks, nuns, laymen,
and laywomen.

The monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen should learn this
Āṭānāṭiya protection well and completely memorize it. If
anyone who does so is approached while walking, standing, sitting, or
lying down by any non-human being with malicious intent---including
males, females, boys, girls, chief ministers, councillors, and servants
among the spirits, centaurs, goblins, and dragons---that non-human will
receive no homage or respect in any village or town. And they will
receive no ground or dwelling in my capital of Ālakamandā.
Nor will they get to go to the conference of the spirits. In addition,
the non-humans would not give or take them in marriage. They'd heap
personal abuse on them, drop an empty bowl on their head, and even split
their head into seven pieces!

For there are, dear sir, non-humans who are fierce, cruel, and violent.
They don't obey the Great Kings or their men or their men's men. They're
said to be rebelling against the Great Kings. They're just like the
bandits in the king of Magadha's realm who don't obey the king, his men,
or his men's men, and are said to be rebelling against the king.

If any non-human being with malicious intent---including males, females,
boys, girls, ministers, councillors, and servants among the spirits,
centaurs, goblins, and dragons---approaches a monk, nun, layman, or
laywoman while walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, one ought to
yell, cry, and scream to the spirits, great spirits, generals, great
generals: 'This spirit's got me! This spirit's entered me! This spirit's
annoying me! This spirit's harassing me! This spirit's hurting me! This
spirit's harming me! This spirit won't let me go!'

To what spirits, great spirits, generals, great generals?

> 'Indra, Soma, and Varuṇa,[^307]\
> Bhāradvāja, the Progenitor,[^308]\
> Candana and Kāmaseṭṭha,\
> Kinnughaṇḍu and Nighaṇḍu,
>
> Panāda and Opamañña,\
> and Mātali, the god's charioteer.\
> Cittasena the centaur,\
> and the kings Nala and Janesabha,
>
> Sātāgira, Hemavata,\
> Puṇṇaka, Karatiya, and Guḷa;[^309]\
> Sivaka and Mucalinda,[^310]\
> Vessāmitta, Yugandhara,[^311]
>
> Gopāla, Suppagedha,[^312]\
> Hiri, Netti, and Mandiya;[^313]\
> Pañcālacaṇḍa, Āḷavaka,[^314]\
> Pajjunna, Sumana, Sumukha,[^315]\
> Dadhimukha, Maṇi, Māṇivara,
> Dīgha,[^316]\
> together with Serīsaka.'[^317]

This, dear sir, is the Āṭānāṭiya protection for the
guarding, protection, safety, and comfort of the monks, nuns, laymen,
and laywomen. Well, now, dear sir, I must go. I have many duties, and
much to do."

"Please, Great Kings, go at your convenience."

Then the four great kings got up from their seats, bowed, and
respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right side, before
vanishing right there. And before the other spirits present vanished,
some bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their
right side, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held
up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and
clan, while some kept silent.


## 2. The Second Recitation Section

Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that
had happened, repeating all the verses spoken. Then he added:

"Mendicants, learn the Āṭānāṭiya protection! Memorize the
Āṭānāṭiya protection! Remember the Āṭānāṭiya
protection! The Āṭānāṭiya protection is beneficial, and is
for the guarding, protection, safety, and comfort of the monks, nuns,
laymen, and laywomen."

That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants approved what
the Buddha said.
