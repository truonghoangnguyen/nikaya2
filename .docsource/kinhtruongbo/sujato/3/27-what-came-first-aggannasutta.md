# DN 27 What Came First  *Aggaññasutta*

So I have heard.[^98] At one time the Buddha was staying
near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of
Migāra's mother in the Eastern Monastery.[^99]

Now at that time Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were
living on probation among the mendicants in hopes of being
ordained.[^100] Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came downstairs
from the longhouse and was walking mindfully in the open air, beneath
the shade of the longhouse.

Vāseṭṭha saw him[^101] and said to Bhāradvāja,
"Reverend Bhāradvāja, the Buddha is walking mindfully in
the open air, beneath the shade of the longhouse. Come, reverend, let's
go to the Buddha. Hopefully we'll get to hear a Dhamma talk from him."

"Yes, reverend," replied Bhāradvāja.

So they went to the Buddha, bowed, and walked beside him.

Then the Buddha said to Vāseṭṭha, "Vāseṭṭha,
you are both brahmins by birth and family, and have gone forth from the
lay life to homelessness from a brahmin family. I hope you don't have to
suffer abuse and insults from the brahmins."

"Actually, sir, the brahmins do insult and abuse us with their typical
insults to the fullest extent."

"But how do the brahmins insult you?"

"Sir, the brahmins say: 'Only brahmins are the best class; other classes
are inferior.[^102] Only brahmins are the light class; other classes are
dark.[^103] Only brahmins are purified, not others.[^104] Only brahmins
are the Divinity's true-born sons, born from his mouth, born of the
Divinity, created by the Divinity, heirs of the Divinity. You've both
abandoned the best class to join an inferior class, namely these
shavelings, fake ascetics, primitives, black spawn from the feet of our
kinsman.[^105] This is not right, it's not proper!' That's how the
brahmins insult us."

"Actually, Vāseṭṭha, the brahmins are forgetting their
tradition when they say this to you. For brahmin women are seen
menstruating, being pregnant, giving birth, and breast-feeding.[^106]
Yet even though they're born from a brahmin womb they say: 'Only
brahmins are the best class; other classes are inferior. Only brahmins
are the light class; other classes are dark. Only brahmins are purified,
not others. Only brahmins are the Divinity's true-born sons, born from
his mouth, born of the Divinity, created by the Divinity, heirs of the
Divinity.' They misrepresent the brahmins, speak falsely, and create
much wickedness.

## 1. Purification in the Four Classes

Vāseṭṭha, there are these four classes: aristocrats,
brahmins, peasants, and menials. Some aristocrats kill living creatures,
steal, and commit sexual misconduct. They use speech that's false,
divisive, harsh, and nonsensical. And they're covetous, malicious, with
wrong view. These things are unskillful, blameworthy, not to be
cultivated, unworthy of the noble ones---and are reckoned as such. They
are dark deeds with dark results, criticized by sensible people. Such
things are exhibited in some aristocrats.[^107] And they are also seen
among some brahmins, peasants, and menials.

But some aristocrats refrain from killing living creatures, stealing,
and committing sexual misconduct. They refrain from speech that's false,
divisive, harsh, and nonsensical. And they're content, kind-hearted,
with right view. These things are skillful, blameless, to be cultivated,
worthy of the noble ones---and are reckoned as such. They are bright
deeds with bright results, praised by sensible people. Such things are
exhibited in some aristocrats. And they are also seen among some
brahmins, peasants, and menials.

Both these things occur like this, mixed up in these four classes---the
dark and the bright, that which is praised and that which is criticized
by sensible people. Yet of this the brahmins say: 'Only brahmins are the
best class; other classes are inferior. Only brahmins are the light
class; other classes are dark. Only brahmins are purified, not others.
Only brahmins are the Divinity's true-born sons, born from his mouth,
born of the Divinity, created by the Divinity, heirs of the Divinity.'

Sensible people don't acknowledge this. Why is that? Because any
mendicant from these four classes who is perfected---with defilements
ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be
done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended
the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed through
enlightenment---is said to be foremost by virtue of principle, not
against principle.[^108] For principle, Vāseṭṭha, is the
best thing for people in both this life and the next.

And here's a way to understand how this is so.

King Pasenadi of Kosala knows that the ascetic Gotama has gone forth
from the neighboring clan of the Sakyans. And the Sakyans are his
vassals.[^109] The Sakyans show deference to King Pasenadi by bowing
down, rising up, greeting him with joined palms, and observing proper
etiquette for him. Now, King Pasenadi shows the same kind of deference
to the Realized One. But he doesn't think: 'The ascetic Gotama is
well-born, I am ill-born.[^110] He is powerful, I am weak. He is
handsome, I am ugly. He is influential, I am insignificant.' Rather, in
showing such deference to the Realized One he is only honoring,
respecting, and venerating principle. And here's another way to
understand how principle is the best thing for people in both this life
and the next.

Vāseṭṭha, you have different births, names, clans, and
families, yet have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness.[^111]
When they ask you what you are, you claim to be ascetics who follow the
Sakyan. But only when someone has faith in the Realized One---settled,
rooted, and planted deep, strong, not to be shifted by any ascetic or
brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone in the
world---is it appropriate for them to say: 'I am the Buddha's true-born
son, born from his mouth, born of principle, created by principle, heir
to principle.'[^112] Why is that? For these are terms for the Realized
One: 'the embodiment of principle', and 'the embodiment of divinity',
and 'the manifestation of principle', and 'the manifestation of
divinity'.[^113]

There comes a time when, Vāseṭṭha, after a very long period
has passed, this cosmos contracts.[^114] As the cosmos contracts,
sentient beings are mostly headed for the realm of streaming radiance.
There they are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, wandering
in midair, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long
time.

There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, this
cosmos expands. As the cosmos expands, sentient beings mostly pass away
from that host of radiant deities and come back to this realm.[^115]
Here they are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, wandering in
midair, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long
time.[^116]

## 2. The Earth's Nectar Appears

But the single mass of water at that time was utterly dark.[^117] The
moon and sun were not found, nor were stars and constellations, day and
night, months and fortnights, years and seasons, or male and female.
Beings were simply known as 'beings'.[^118] After a very long period had
passed, the earth's nectar curdled in the water.[^119] It appeared just
like the curd on top of hot milk-rice as it cools. It was beautiful,
fragrant, and delicious, like ghee or butter. And it was as sweet as
pure dwarf-bee honey.[^120] Now, one of those beings was reckless.
Thinking, 'Oh my, what might this be?' they tasted the earth's nectar
with their finger.[^121] They enjoyed it, and craving was born in
them.[^122] And other beings, following that being's example, tasted the
earth's nectar with their fingers. They too enjoyed it, and craving was
born in them.

## 3. The Moon and Sun Appear

Then those beings started to eat the earth's nectar, breaking it into
lumps. But when they did this their luminosity vanished. And with the
vanishing of their luminosity the moon and sun appeared, stars and
constellations appeared, days and nights were distinguished, and so were
months and fortnights, and years and seasons. So far had the world
evolved once more.

Then those beings eating the earth's nectar, with that as their food and
nourishment, remained for a very long time. But so long as they ate that
earth's nectar, their bodies became more solid and they diverged in
appearance; some beautiful, some ugly. And the beautiful beings looked
down on the ugly ones:[^123] 'We're more beautiful, they're the ugly
ones!' And the vanity of the beautiful ones made the earth's nectar
vanish. They gathered together and bemoaned, 'Oh, what a taste! Oh, what
a taste!' And even today when people get something tasty they say: 'Oh,
what a taste! Oh, what a taste!' They're just remembering an ancient
primordial saying, but they don't understand what it means.[^124]

## 4. Ground-Fungus

When the earth's nectar had vanished, ground-fungus appeared to those
beings.[^125] It appeared just like a mushroom. It was beautiful,
fragrant, and delicious, like ghee or butter. And it was as sweet as
pure dwarf-bee honey.

Then those beings started to eat the ground-fungus. With that as their
food and nourishment, they remained for a very long time. But so long as
they ate that ground-fungus, their bodies became more solid and they
diverged in appearance; some beautiful, some ugly. And the beautiful
beings looked down on the ugly ones: 'We're more beautiful, they're the
ugly ones!' And the vanity of the beautiful ones made the ground-fungus
vanish.

## 5. Bursting Pods

When the ground-fungus had vanished, bursting pods appeared, like the
fruit of the kadam tree.[^126] They were beautiful, fragrant, and
delicious, like ghee or butter. And they were as sweet as pure dwarf-bee
honey.

Then those beings started to eat the bursting pods. With that as their
food and nourishment, they remained for a very long time. But so long as
they ate those bursting pods, their bodies became more solid and they
diverged in appearance; some beautiful, some ugly. And the beautiful
beings looked down on the ugly ones: 'We're more beautiful, they're the
ugly ones!' And the vanity of the beautiful ones made the bursting pods
vanish.

They gathered together and bemoaned, 'Oh, what we've lost! Oh, what
we've lost---those bursting pods!' And even today when people experience
suffering they say: 'Oh, what we've lost! Oh, what we've lost!' They're
just remembering an ancient primordial saying, but they don't understand
what it means.

## 6. Ripe Untilled Rice

When the bursting pods had vanished, ripe untilled rice appeared to
those beings. It had no powder or husk, pure and fragrant, with only the
rice-grain. What they took for supper in the evening, by the morning had
grown back and ripened. And what they took for breakfast in the morning
had grown back and ripened by the evening, leaving no trace showing.
Then those beings eating the ripe untilled rice, with that as their food
and nourishment, remained for a very long time.

## 7. Sex Appears

But so long as they ate that ripe untilled rice, their bodies became
more solid and they diverged in appearance. And female characteristics
appeared on women, while male characteristics appeared on men.[^127]
Women spent too much time gazing at men, and men at women. They became
lustful, and their bodies burned with fever. Due to this fever they had
sex with each other.

Those who saw them having sex pelted them with dirt, clods, or cow-dung,
saying,[^128] 'Get lost, filth! Get lost, filth![^129] How on earth can
one being do that to another?'[^130] And even today people in some
countries, when carrying a bride off, pelt her with dirt, clods, or
cow-dung.[^131] They're just remembering an ancient primordial saying,
but they don't understand what it means.

## 8. Sexual Intercourse

What was deemed as unprincipled at that time, these days is deemed as
principled.[^132] The beings who had sex together weren't allowed to
enter a village or town for one or two months. Ever since they
excessively threw themselves into immorality, they started to make
buildings to hide their immoral deeds.[^133] Then one of those beings of
idle disposition thought, 'Hey now, why should I be bothered to gather
rice in the evening for supper, and in the morning for breakfast? Why
don't I gather rice for supper and breakfast all at once?'[^134]

So that's what he did. Then one of the other beings approached that
being and said, 'Come, good being, we shall go to gather rice.' 'There's
no need, good being! I gathered rice for supper and breakfast all at
once.' So that being, following their example, gathered rice for two
days all at once, thinking: 'This seems fine.'[^135]

Then one of the other beings approached that being and said, 'Come, good
being, we shall go to gather rice.' 'There's no need, good being! I
gathered rice for two days all at once.' So that being, following their
example, gathered rice for four days all at once, thinking: 'This seems
fine.'

Then one of the other beings approached that being and said, 'Come, good
being, we shall go to gather rice.' 'There's no need, good being! I
gathered rice for four days all at once.' So that being, following their
example, gathered rice for eight days all at once, thinking: 'This seems
fine.'

But when they started to store up rice to eat, the rice grains became
wrapped in powder and husk, it didn't grow back after reaping, leaving a
trace showing, and the rice stood in clumps.[^136]

## 9. Dividing the Rice

Then those beings gathered together and bemoaned, 'Oh, how wicked things
have appeared among beings![^137] For we used to be mind-made, feeding
on rapture, self-luminous, wandering in midair, steadily glorious, and
we remained like that for a very long time. After a very long period had
passed, the earth's nectar curdled in the water. But due to bad,
unskillful things among us, the earth's nectar vanished, then the
ground-fungus vanished, the bursting pods vanished, and now the rice
grains have become wrapped in powder and husk, it doesn't grow back
after reaping, traces are left showing, and the rice stands in clumps.
We'd better divide up the rice and lay down boundaries.'[^138] So that's
what they did.

Now, one of those beings was reckless. While guarding their own share
they took another's share without it being given, and ate it.[^139]

They grabbed the one who had done this and said, 'You have done a bad
thing, good being, in that while guarding your own share you took
another's share without it being given, and ate it. Do not do such a
thing again.'

'Yes, sirs,' replied that being. But for a second time, and a third time
they did the same thing, and were told not to continue.[^140] And then
they struck that being, some with fists, others with stones, and still
others with rods.[^141] From that day on stealing was found, and blame,
and lying, and the taking up of rods.[^142]

## 10. The Elected King

Then those beings gathered together and bemoaned, 'Oh, how wicked things
have appeared among beings, in that stealing is found, and blaming and
lying and the taking up of rods! Why don't we elect one being who would
rightly accuse those who deserve it, blame those who deserve it, and
expel those who deserve it?[^143] We shall pay them with a share of
rice.'[^144]

Then those beings approached the being among them who was most
attractive, good-looking, lovely, and illustrious, and said,[^145]
'Come, good being, rightly accuse those who deserve it, blame those who
deserve it, and banish those who deserve it.[^146] We shall pay you with
a share of rice.' 'Yes, sirs,' replied that being. They acted
accordingly, and were paid with a share of rice.

'Elected by the people', Vāseṭṭha, is the meaning of
'elected one', the first term applied to them.[^147]

'Lord of the fields' is the meaning of 'aristocrat', the second term
applied to them.[^148]

'They please others with principle' is the meaning of 'king', the third
term applied to them.[^149]

And that, Vāseṭṭha, is how the ancient primordial terms for
the circle of aristocrats were created; for those very beings, not
others; for those like them, not unlike; by virtue of principle, not
against principle. For principle, Vāseṭṭha, is the best
thing for people in both this life and the next.

## 11. The Circle of Brahmins

Then some of those same beings thought, 'Oh, how wicked things have
appeared among beings, in that stealing is found, and blaming and lying
and the taking up of rods and banishment! Why don't we set aside bad,
unskillful things?'[^150] So that's what they did.

'They set aside bad, unskillful things' is the meaning of 'brahmin', the
first term applied to them.[^151]

They built leaf huts in a wilderness region where they meditated pure
and bright, without lighting cooking fires or digging the soil. They
came down in the morning for breakfast and in the evening for supper to
the village, town, or royal capital seeking a meal.[^152] When they had
obtained food they continued to meditate in the leaf huts.

When people noticed this they said, 'These beings build leaf huts in a
wilderness region where they meditate pure and bright, without lighting
cooking fires or digging the soil. They come down in the morning for
breakfast and in the evening for supper to the village, town, or royal
capital seeking a meal. When they have obtained food they continue to
meditate in the leaf huts.'

'They meditate' is the meaning of 'meditator', the second term applied
to them.[^153]

But some of those beings were unable to keep up with their meditation in
the leaf huts in the wilderness. They came down to the neighborhood of a
village or town where they dwelt compiling texts.[^154]

When people noticed this they said, 'These beings were unable to keep up
with their meditation in the leaf huts in the wilderness. They came down
to the neighborhood of a village or town where they dwelt compiling
texts. Now they don't meditate.'

'Now they don't meditate' is the meaning of 'reciter', the third term
applied to them.[^155] What was deemed as worse at that time, these days
is deemed as best.

And that, Vāseṭṭha, is how the ancient primordial terms for
the circle of brahmins were created; for those very beings, not others;
for those like them, not unlike; by virtue of principle, not against
principle. For principle, Vāseṭṭha, is the best thing for
people in both this life and the next.

## 12. The Circle of Peasants

Some of those same beings, taking up an active sex life, applied
themselves to various jobs.

'Having taken up an active sex life, they apply themselves to various
jobs' is the meaning of 'peasant', the term applied to them.[^156]

And that, Vāseṭṭha, is how the ancient primordial term for
the circle of peasants was created; for those very beings, not others;
for those like them, not unlike; by virtue of principle, not against
principle. For principle, Vāseṭṭha, is the best thing for
people in both this life and the next.

## 13. The Circle of Menials

The remaining beings lived by venal hunting and minor tasks.

'They live by venal hunting and minor tasks' is the meaning of 'menial',
the term applied to them.[^157]

And that, Vāseṭṭha, is how the ancient primordial term for
the circle of menials was created; for those very beings, not others;
for those like them, not unlike; by virtue of principle, not against
principle. For principle, Vāseṭṭha, is the best thing for
people in both this life and the next.

There came a time when an aristocrat,[^158] brahmin, peasant, or menial,
deprecating their own vocation, went forth from the lay life to
homelessness, thinking, 'I will be an ascetic.'

From these four circles, Vāseṭṭha, the circle of ascetics
was created; for those very beings, not others; for those like them, not
unlike; by virtue of principle, not against principle. For principle,
Vāseṭṭha, is the best thing for people in both this life
and the next.

## 14. On Bad Conduct

An aristocrat, brahmin, peasant, menial, or ascetic may do bad things by
way of body, speech, and mind. They have wrong view, and they act out of
that wrong view. And because of that, when their body breaks up, after
death, they're reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld,
hell.

An aristocrat, brahmin, peasant, menial, or ascetic may do good things
by way of body, speech, and mind. They have right view, and they act out
of that right view. And because of that, when their body breaks up,
after death, they're reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.

An aristocrat, brahmin, peasant, menial, or ascetic may do mixed things
by way of body, speech, and mind. They have mixed view, and they act out
of that mixed view. And because of that, when their body breaks up,
after death, they experience both pleasure and pain.

## 15. The Qualities That Lead to Awakening

An aristocrat, brahmin, peasant, menial, or ascetic who is restrained in
body, speech, and mind, and develops the seven qualities that lead to
awakening, becomes extinguished in this very life.

Any mendicant from these four classes who is perfected---with
defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what
had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal,
utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed
through enlightenment---is said to be the foremost by virtue of
principle, not against principle. For principle, Vāseṭṭha,
is the best thing for people in both this life and the next.

The divinity Sanaṅkumāra also spoke this verse:

> 'The aristocrat is best among people\
> who take clan as the standard.\
> But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct\
> is first among gods and humans.'

That verse was well sung by the Divinity Sanaṅkumāra, not
poorly sung; well spoken, not poorly spoken; beneficial, not harmful,
and I agree with it.[^159] I also say:

> The aristocrat is best among people\
> who take clan as the standard.\
> But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct\
> is first among gods and humans."

That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, Vāseṭṭha and
Bhāradvāja approved what the Buddha said.
