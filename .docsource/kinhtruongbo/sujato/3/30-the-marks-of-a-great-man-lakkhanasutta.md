# DN 30 The Marks of a Great Man  *Lakkhaṇasutta*

So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"There are thirty-two marks of a great man. A great man who possesses
these has only two possible destinies, no other.[^221] If he stays at
home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled
king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in
the country, and he possesses the seven treasures. He has the following
seven treasures: the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the
woman, the householder, and the commander as the seventh treasure. He
has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies
of his enemies. After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigns by
principle, without rod or sword. But if he goes forth from the lay life
to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha,
who draws back the veil from the world.

And what are the thirty-two marks?[^222]

He has well-planted feet.

On the soles of his feet there are thousand-spoked wheels, with rims and
hubs, complete in every detail.

He has stretched heels.

He has long fingers.

His hands and feet are tender.

He has serried hands and feet.

The tops of his feet are arched.

His calves are like those of an antelope.

When standing upright and not bending over, the palms of both hands
touch the knees.

His private parts are covered in a foreskin.

He is golden colored; his skin shines like lustrous gold.

He has delicate skin, so delicate that dust and dirt don't stick to his
body.

His hairs grow one per pore.

His hairs stand up; they're blue-black and curl clockwise.

His body is tall and straight-limbed.

He has bulging muscles in seven places.

His chest is like that of a lion.

He is filled out between the shoulders.

He has the proportional circumference of a banyan tree: the span of his
arms equals the height of his body.

His torso is cylindrical.

He has ridged taste buds.

His jaw is like that of a lion.

He has forty teeth.

His teeth are even.

His teeth have no gaps.

His teeth are perfectly white.

He has a large tongue.

He has the voice of the Divinity,\
\>like a cuckoo's call.

His eyes are indigo.

He has eyelashes like a cow's.

Between his eyebrows there grows a tuft, soft and white like
cotton-wool.

The crown of his head is like a turban.

These are the thirty-two marks of a great man. A great man who possesses
these has only two possible destinies, no other.

Seers who are outsiders remember these marks, but they do not know the
specific deeds performed in the past to obtain each mark.[^223]

## 1. Well-Planted Feet

In some past lives, past existences, past abodes the Realized One was
reborn as a human being. He firmly and persistently undertook skillful
behaviors such as good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, giving
and sharing, taking precepts, observing the sabbath, paying due respect
to mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, honoring the elders in the
family, and various other things pertaining to skillful behaviors.[^224]
Due to performing, accumulating, heaping up, and amassing those deeds,
when his body broke up, after death, he was reborn in a good place, a
heavenly realm. There he surpassed the other gods in ten respects:
heavenly lifespan, beauty, happiness, glory, sovereignty, sights,
sounds, smells, tastes, and touches. When he passed away from there and
came back to this place he obtained this mark of a great man: he has
well-planted feet. He places his foot on the ground evenly, raises it
evenly, and touches the ground evenly with the whole sole of his foot.

Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning
monarch. He has the following seven treasures: the wheel, the elephant,
the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder, and the commander as
the seventh treasure. He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and
heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies. After conquering this land
girt by sea---free of harassment by bandits, successful and prosperous,
safe, blessed, and untroubled---he reigns by principle, without rod or
sword. And what does he obtain as king? He can't be stopped by any human
foe or enemy. That's what he obtains as king. But if he goes forth from
the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully
awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world. And what does
he obtain as Buddha? He can't be stopped by any foe or enemy whether
internal or external; nor by greed, hate, or delusion; nor by any
ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone
in the world. That's what he obtains as Buddha." The Buddha spoke this
matter.

On this it is said:

> "Truth, principle, self-control, and restraint;[^225]\
> purity, precepts, and observing the sabbath;\
> giving, harmlessness, delighting in non-violence---\
> firmly undertaking these things, he lived accordingly.
>
> By means of these deeds he went to heaven,\
> where he enjoyed happiness and merriment.\
> After passing away from there to here,\
> he steps evenly on this rich earth.
>
> The gathered soothsayers predicted\
> that there is no stopping one of such even tread,\
> as householder or renunciate.\
> That's the meaning shown by this mark.
>
> While living at home he cannot be stopped,\
> he defeats his foes, and cannot be beaten.\
> Due to the fruit of that deed,\
> he cannot be stopped by any human.
>
> But if he chooses the life gone forth,\
> seeing clearly, loving renunciation,\
> not even the best can ever stop him;[^226]\
> this is the nature of the supreme person."

## 2. Wheels on the Feet

"Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human
being. He conveyed happiness to many people, eliminating threats,
terror, and danger, providing just protection and security, and giving
gifts with all the trimmings.[^227] Due to performing those deeds he was
reborn in a heavenly realm. When he came back to this place he obtained
this mark: on the soles of his feet there are thousand-spoked wheels,
with rims and hubs, complete in every detail and well divided inside.

Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning
monarch. And what does he obtain as king? He has a large following of
brahmins and householders, people of town and country, finance
ministers, military officers, guardsmen, ministers, councillors, rulers,
tax beneficiaries, and princes. That's what he obtains as king. But if
he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a fully
awakened Buddha. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He has a large
following of monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, humans, titans,
dragons, and centaurs. That's what he obtains as Buddha." The Buddha
spoke this matter.

On this it is said:

> "In olden days, in past lives,\
> he brought happiness to many people,\
> ridding them of fear, terror, and danger,\
> eagerly guarding and protecting them.
>
> By means of these deeds he went to heaven,\
> where he enjoyed happiness and merriment.\
> After passing away from there to here,\
> wheels on his two feet are found,
>
> all rimmed around and thousand-spoked.\
> The gathered soothsayers predicted,\
> seeing the prince\
> \>with the hundred-fold mark of merits,[^228]\
> that he'd have a following, subduing foes,
>
> which is why he has wheels all rimmed around.\
> If he doesn't choose the life gone forth,\
> he'll roll the wheel and rule the land.\
> The aristocrats will be his vassals,
>
> flocking to his glory.\
> But if he chooses the life gone forth,\
> seeing clearly, loving renunciation,\
> the gods, humans, titans, Sakka, and monsters;
>
> centaurs and dragons, birds and beasts,\
> will flock to his glory,\
> the supreme, honored by gods and humans."

## 3--5. Stretched Heels, Etc.

"Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human
being. He gave up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the
sword. He was scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all
living beings. Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly
realm. When he came back to this place he obtained these three marks: he
has stretched heels, long fingers, and his body is tall and
straight-limbed.[^229]

Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning
monarch. And what does he obtain as king? He's long-lived, preserving
his life for a long time. No human foe or enemy is able to take his life
before his time. That's what he obtains as king. And what does he obtain
as Buddha? He's long-lived, preserving his life for a long time. No foes
or enemies---nor any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or
divinity or anyone in the world---is able to take his life before his
time. That's what he obtains as Buddha." The Buddha spoke this matter.

On this it is said:

> "Realizing for himself the horrors of death,\
> he refrained from killing other creatures.\
> By that good conduct he went to heaven,\
> where he enjoyed the fruit of deeds well done.
>
> Passing away, on his return to here,\
> he obtained these three marks:\
> his stretched heels are abundant and long,\
> and like the Divinity, he's straight and beautiful,\
> \>with well-formed limbs.[^230]
>
> Fair of arm, youthful, of good posture and breeding,\
> his fingers are soft and tender and long.\
> By these three marks of an excellent man,\
> they indicated that the prince's life would be long:
>
> 'As a householder he will live long;[^231]\
> longer still if he goes forth, due to\
> mastery in the development of psychic power.\
> Thus this is the sign of long life.'"

## 6. Seven Bulging Places

"Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human
being. He was a donor of delicious and tasty cooked and fresh foods, and
drinks that were sweet and succulent.[^232] Due to performing those
deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm. When he came back to this place
he obtained this mark: he has bulging muscles in seven places. Both
hands, both feet, both shoulders, and his chest are all bulging.

Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning
monarch. And what does he obtain as king? He gets delicious and tasty
cooked and fresh foods, and drinks that are sweet and succulent. That's
what he obtains as king. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He gets
delicious and tasty cooked and fresh foods, and drinks that are sweet

matter.

On this it is said:

> "He used to give the very best of flavors---\
> scrumptious foods of every kind.\
> Because of that good deed,\
> he rejoiced long in Nandana heaven.
>
> On returning to here, he is rounded in seven places,\
> and tender hands and feet are found.\
> The soothsayers expert in signs declared:\
> 'He'll get tasty foods of all sorts
>
> as a householder, that's what that means.\
> But even if he goes forth he'll get the same,\
> supreme in gaining tasty foods of all sorts,\
> cutting all bonds of the lay life.'"

## 7--8. Tender and Serried Hands

"Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human
being. He brought people together using the four ways of being
inclusive: giving, kindly words, taking care, and equality. Due to
performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm. When he came
back to this place he obtained these two marks: his hands and feet are
tender, and they are serried.[^233]

Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning
monarch. And what does he obtain as king? His retinue is inclusive,
cohesive, and well-managed. This includes brahmins and householders,
people of town and country, finance ministers, military officers,
guardsmen, ministers, councillors, rulers, tax beneficiaries, and
princes.[^234] That's what he obtains as king. And what does he obtain
as Buddha? His retinue is inclusive and well-managed. This includes
monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, humans, titans, dragons, and
centaurs. That's what he obtains as Buddha." The Buddha spoke this
matter.

On this it is said:

> "By giving and helping others,\
> kindly speech, and equal treatment,\
> such action and conduct as brought people together,\
> he went to heaven due to his esteemed virtue.
>
> Passing away, on his return to here,\
> the young baby prince obtained\
> hands and feet so tender and serried,\
> lovely, graceful, and good-looking.
>
> His retinue is loyal and manageable,\
> staying agreeably all over this broad land.[^235]\
> Speaking kindly, seeking happiness,\
> he implements agreeable qualities.
>
> But if he gives up all sensual enjoyments,\
> as victor he speaks Dhamma to the people.\
> Devoted, they respond to his words;\
> after listening, they practice in line with the teaching."

## 9--10. Arched Feet and Upright Hair

"Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human
being. His speech was meaningful and principled. He educated many
people, bringing welfare and happiness, offering the teaching. Due to
performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm. When he came
back to this place he obtained these two marks: the tops of his feet are
arched and his hairs stand up.[^236]

Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning
monarch. And what does he obtain as king? He is the foremost, best,
chief, highest, and finest of those who enjoy sensual pleasures. That's
what he obtains as king. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He is the
foremost, best, chief, highest, and finest of all sentient beings.
That's what he obtains as Buddha." The Buddha spoke this matter.

On this it is said:

> "His word was meaningful and principled,\
> moving the people with his explanations.\
> He brought welfare and happiness to creatures,\
> unstintingly offering up teaching.
>
> Because of that good deed,\
> he advanced to heaven and there rejoiced.\
> On return to here two marks are found,\
> of excellence and supremacy.
>
> His hairs stand upright,\
> and his ankles stand out well.\
> Swollen with flesh and blood, encased in skin,\
> beautified above the feet.
>
> If such a one lives in the home, he becomes\
> the best of those who enjoy sensual pleasures.\
> There'll be none better than him;\
> he'll proceed\
> \>having mastered all the Black Plum Tree Land.
>
> But going forth the peerless renunciate\
> turns into the best of all creatures.\
> There'll be none better than him,\
> he'll live having mastered the whole world."

## 11. Antelope Calves

"Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human
being. He was a thorough teacher of a profession, a branch of knowledge,
conduct, or action, thinking: 'How might they quickly learn and
practice, without getting exhausted?' Due to performing those deeds he

obtained this mark: his calves are like those of an antelope.[^237]

Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning
monarch. And what does he obtain as king? He quickly obtains the things
worthy of a king, the factors, supports, and things befitting a king.
That's what he obtains as king. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He

Buddha spoke this matter.

On this it is said:

> "In professions, knowledge, conduct, and deeds,\
> he thought of how they might easily learn.\
> Quickly, without tiresome delays,\
> he taught them things that harm no-one at all.
>
> Having done that skillful deed\
> \>whose outcome is happiness,\
> he gains prominent and elegant calves.\
> Well-formed in graceful spirals,\
> he's covered in fine rising hairs.
>
> They say that person has antelope calves,\
> and that this is the mark of swift success.\
> If he desires the things fitting the household life,\
> not going forth, they'll quickly be his.
>
> But if he chooses the life gone forth,\
> seeing clearly, loving renunciation,\
> the peerless renunciate will quickly find\
> what is fitting and suitable."[^238]

## 12. Delicate Skin

"Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human
being. He approached an ascetic or brahmin and asked: 'Sirs, what is
skillful? What is unskillful? What is blameworthy? What is blameless?
What should be cultivated? What should not be cultivated? Doing what
leads to my lasting harm and suffering? Doing what leads to my lasting
welfare and happiness?' Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a

body.[^239]

Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning

That's what he obtains as king. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He

> eager to understand, he asked questions.\
> Keen to learn, he waited on renunciates,\
> heeding their explanation with pure intent.
>
> Due to that deed of acquiring wisdom,\
> as a human being his skin is delicate.\
> At his birth\
> \>the soothsayers expert in signs prophesied:\
> 'He'll discern delicate matters.'
>
> If he doesn't choose the life gone forth,\
> he'll roll the wheel and rule the land.\
> Among those with material things\
> \>who have been educated,\
> none equal or better than him is found.
>
> But if he chooses the life gone forth,\
> seeing clearly, loving renunciation,\
> gaining wisdom that's supreme and eminent,\
> the one of superb, vast intelligence\
> \>attains awakening."

## 13. Golden Skin

"Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human
being. He wasn't irritable or bad-tempered. Even when heavily criticized

> In an earlier life he poured forth cloth\
> fine and soft to touch,\
> like a god pouring rain on this broad earth.[^242]
>
> So doing he passed from here to heaven,\
> where he enjoyed the fruits of deeds well done.\
> Here he wins a figure shining like honey-yellow gold,[^243]\
> like Indra, the finest of gods.
>
> If that man stays in the house, not wishing to go forth,\
> he conquers and rules this vast, broad earth.\
> He obtains abundant excellent cloth,\
> so fine and soft to touch.
>
> He receives robes, cloth, and the finest garments[^244]\
> if he chooses the life gone forth.\
> For he still partakes of past deed's fruit;\
> what's been done is never lost."

## 14. Privates in Foreskin

"Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human

loved ones, and companions. He reunited mother with child and child with

brother with sister, sister with brother, and sister with sister,
bringing them together with rejoicing. Due to performing those deeds he

> his private parts are covered in a foreskin.
>
> Such a one has many sons,\

> valiant and heroic, devastating foes,\
> a layman's joy, speaking kindly.
>
> But if he lives the renunciate life\
> he has even more sons following his word.\
> As householder or renunciate,\
> that's the meaning shown by this mark."


## 15--16. Equal Proportions and Touching the Knees

"Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human
being. Examining the gathered population, he knew what they had in
common and what was their own; he knew each person, and he knew the
distinctions between people. In each case, he made appropriate
distinctions between people: 'This one deserves that; that one deserves
this.' Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm.
When he came back to this place he obtained these two marks: he has the
proportional circumference of a banyan tree; and when standing upright
and not bending over, the palms of both hands touch the knees.[^246]

Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning
monarch. And what does he obtain as king? He is rich, affluent, and
wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, lots
of money and grain, and a full treasury and storehouses. That's what he
obtains as king. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He is rich,
affluent, and wealthy. He has these kinds of wealth: the wealth of
faith, ethics, conscience, prudence, learning, generosity, and wisdom.
That's what he obtains as Buddha." The Buddha spoke this matter.

On this it is said:

> "Examining the many people in a community,\
> he weighed, evaluated, and judged each case:\
> 'This one deserves that.'\
> That's how he used to draw\
> \>distinctions between people.
>
> Now standing without bending\
> he can touch his knees with both hands.\
> With the remaining ripening\
> \>of the fruit of good deeds,\
> his circumference was that of a great tree.
>
> Learned experts in the many different\
> signs and marks prophesied:\
> 'The young prince will obtain\
> many different things that householders deserve.
>
> Here there are many suitable pleasures\
> for the ruler of the land to enjoy as householder.\
> But if he gives up all sensual enjoyments,\
> he will gain the supreme, highest peak of wealth.'"

## 17--19. A Lion's Chest, Etc.

"Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human
being. He desired the good, the welfare, the comfort, and sanctuary of
the people, thinking: 'How might they flourish in faith, ethics,
learning, generosity, teachings, and wisdom; in wealth and grain, fields
and land, birds and beasts, children and partners; in bondservants,
workers, and staff; in family, friends, and kin?' Due to performing
those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm. When he came back to this
place he obtained these three marks: his chest is like that of a lion;
he is filled out between the shoulders.; and his torso is
cylindrical.[^247]

Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning
monarch. And what does he obtain as king? He's not liable to decline. He
doesn't decline in wealth and grain, fields and land, birds and beasts,
children and partners; in bondservants, workers, and staff; in family,
friends, and kin. He doesn't decline in any of his accomplishments.
That's what he obtains as king. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He's
not liable to decline. He doesn't decline in faith, ethics, learning,
generosity, and wisdom. He doesn't decline in any of his
accomplishments.[^248] That's what he obtains as Buddha." The Buddha
spoke this matter.

On this it is said:

> "His wish was this: 'How may others not decline\
> in faith, ethics, learning, and intelligence,\
> in generosity, teachings, and much good else,\
> in coin and grain, fields and lands,
>
> in children, partners, and livestock,\
> in family, friends, and kin,\
> in strength, and both beauty and happiness?'\
> And so he ever desired their success.
>
> His chest was prominent like that of a lion,\
> filled out between the shoulders,\
> \>and torso cylindrical.\
> Due to the well-done deeds of the past,\
> he had that portent of non-decline.
>
> Even as layman he grows in coin and grain,\
> in wives, children, and livestock.\
> But once gone forth, owning nothing, he attains\
> the supreme awakening which may never decline."

## 20. Ridged Taste Buds

"Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human
being. He would never hurt any sentient being with fists, stones, rods,
or swords. Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly

ridged taste buds. His raised taste receptors, originating in the
throat, disperse evenly.

Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning
monarch. And what does he obtain as king? He is rarely ill or unwell.
His stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold.[^249]
That's what he obtains as king. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He is
rarely ill or unwell. His stomach digests well, being neither too hot
nor too cold, but just right, and fit for meditation. That's what he
obtains as Buddha." The Buddha spoke this matter.

On this it is said:

> "Not with fist or rod or stone,\
> or sword or beating to death,\
> or by bondage or threats\
> did he ever harm anyone.
>
> For that very reason he rejoiced in heaven\
> \>after passing away,\
> finding happiness as a fruit of happy deeds.\
> With taste receptors prominent\
> \>and evenly spreading nutrition,\
> on his return here he has ridged taste buds.
>
> That's why the clever prophets said:\
> 'This man will have much happiness\
> as householder or renunciate.\
> That's the meaning shown by this mark.'"

## 21--22. Indigo Eyes

"Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human
being. When looking at others he didn't glare, look askance, or avert
his eyes. Being straightforward, he reached out to others with
straightforward intentions, looking at people with kindly eyes. Due to
performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm. When he came
back to this place he obtained these two marks: his eyes are indigo, and
he has eyelashes like a cow's.[^250]

Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning
monarch. And what does he obtain as king? The people look on him with
kindly eyes. He is dear and beloved to the brahmins and householders,
people of town and country, finance ministers, military officers,
guardsmen, ministers, councillors, rulers, tax beneficiaries, and
princes. That's what he obtains as king. And what does he obtain as
Buddha? The people look on him with kindly eyes. He is dear and beloved
to the monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, humans, titans, dragons, and
centaurs. That's what he obtains as Buddha." The Buddha spoke this
matter.

On this it is said:

> "With not a glare or glance askance,\
> nor averting of the eyes;\
> straightforward, he reached out straightforwardly,\
> looking at people with kindly eyes.
>
> In good rebirths he enjoyed the fruit\
> and result, rejoicing there.\
> But here he has a cow's eyelashes,\
> and indigo eyes so fair to see.
>
> Many soothsayers, men clever[^251]\
> and learned in prognostic texts,\
> expert in cow-like lashes, indicated he'd\
> be looked upon with kindly eyes.
>
> Even as a householder he'd be regarded kindly,\
> beloved of the people.\
> But if he becomes an ascetic, not lay,\
> as destroyer of sorrow he'll be loved by many."

## 23. Crown Like a Turban

"Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human
being. He was the leader and forerunner of people in skillful behaviors
such as good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, giving and
sharing, taking precepts, observing the sabbath, paying due respect to
mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, honoring the elders in the
family, and various other things pertaining to skillful behaviors.[^252]
Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm. When he

Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning
monarch. And what does he obtain as king? He has a large following of
brahmins and householders, people of town and country, finance
ministers, military officers, guardsmen, ministers, councillors, rulers,
tax beneficiaries, and princes. That's what he obtains as king. And what
does he obtain as Buddha? He has a large following of monks, nuns,
laymen, laywomen, gods, humans, titans, dragons, and centaurs. That's
what he obtains as Buddha." The Buddha spoke this matter.

On this it is said:

> "Among people of good conduct, he was the leader,\
> devoted to a life of principle among the principled.\
> The people followed him,\
> and he experienced the fruit of good deeds in heaven.
>
> Having experienced that fruit,\
> he gains a head crowned like a turban.\
> The experts in omens and signs prophesied:\
> 'He will be leader of the people.
>
> Among people then, as before,\
> they will bring presents for him.\
> If he becomes an aristocrat, ruler of the land,\
> he'll gain the service of the people.
>
> But if that man goes forth,\
> he'll be sophisticated, proficient in the teachings.\
> Devoted to the virtues of his instruction,\
> the people will become his followers.'"

## 24--25. One Hair Per Pore, and a Tuft

"Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human
being. He refrained from lying. He spoke the truth and stuck to the
truth. He was honest and dependable, and didn't trick the world with his
words. Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm.
When he came back to this place he obtained these two marks: his hairs
grow one per pore, and between his eyebrows there grows a tuft, soft and
white like cotton-wool.[^253]

Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning
monarch. And what does he obtain as king? He has many close adherents
among the brahmins and householders, people of town and country, finance
ministers, military officers, guardsmen, ministers, councillors, rulers,
tax beneficiaries, and princes. That's what he obtains as king. And what
does he obtain as Buddha? He has many close adherents among the monks,
nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, humans, titans, dragons, and centaurs.
That's what he obtains as Buddha." The Buddha spoke this matter.

On this it is said:

> "In past lives he was true to his promise,\
> with no forked tongue, he shunned lies.\
> He never broke his word to anyone,\
> but spoke what was true, real, and factual.
>
> A tuft so very white like cotton-wool\
> grew prettily between his eyebrows.\
> And never two, but only one,\
> hair grew in each of his pores.
>
> Many soothsayers learned in marks\
> and expert in signs gathered and prophesied:\
> 'One like this, with tuft and hair so prominent,\
> will have many as his close adherents.
>
> Even as householder many people will follow him,\
> due to the power of deeds in the past.\
> But once gone forth, owning nothing,\
> as Buddha the people will follow him.'"

## 26--27. Forty Gapless Teeth

"Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human
being. He refrained from divisive speech. He didn't repeat in one place
what he heard in another so as to divide people against each other.
Instead, he reconciled those who were divided, supporting unity,
delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote
harmony. Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly
realm. When he came back to this place he obtained these two marks: he
has forty teeth, and his teeth have no gaps.[^254]

Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning
monarch. And what does he obtain as king? His retinue cannot be divided.
This includes brahmins and householders, people of town and country,
finance ministers, military officers, guardsmen, ministers, councillors,
rulers, tax beneficiaries, and princes. That's what he obtains as king.
And what does he obtain as Buddha? His retinue cannot be divided. This
includes monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, humans, titans, dragons,
and centaurs. That's what he obtains as Buddha." The Buddha spoke this
matter.

On this it is said:

> "He spoke no words divisive causing friends to split,\
> creating disputes that foster division,\
> acting improperly by fostering quarrels,\
> creating division among friends.
>
> He spoke kind words to foster harmony,\
> uniting those who are divided.\
> He eliminated quarrels among the people,\
> rejoicing together with the united.
>
> In good rebirths he enjoyed the fruit\
> and result, rejoicing there.\
> Here his teeth are gapless, close together,\
> forty standing prominent in his mouth.
>
> If he becomes an aristocrat, ruler of the land,\
> his assembly will be indivisible.\
> And as an ascetic, stainless, immaculate,\
> his assembly will follow him, unshakable."

## 28--29. A Large Tongue and the Voice of the Divinity

"Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human
being. He refrained from harsh speech. He spoke in a way that's mellow,
pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and
agreeable to the people. Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in
a heavenly realm. When he came back to this place he obtained these two
marks: he has a large tongue, and the voice of the Divinity, like a
cuckoo's call.

Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning
monarch. And what does he obtain as king? He has a persuasive voice. His
words are persuasive to brahmins and householders, people of town and
country, finance ministers, military officers, guardsmen, ministers,
councillors, rulers, tax beneficiaries, and princes. That's what he
obtains as king. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He has a persuasive
voice. His words are persuasive to monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods,
humans, titans, dragons, and centaurs. That's what he obtains as
Buddha." The Buddha spoke this matter.

On this it is said:

> "He never spoke a loud harsh word,\
> insulting, quarrelsome,\
> causing harm, rude, crushing the people.\
> His speech was sweet, helpful, and courteous.
>
> He uttered words dear to the mind,\
> going to the heart, pleasing to the ear.\
> He enjoyed the fruit of his good verbal conduct,\
> experiencing the fruit of good deeds in heaven.
>
> Having experienced that fruit,\
> on his return to here\
> \>he acquired the voice of the Divinity.\
> His tongue was long and wide,\
> and his speech was persuasive.
>
> Even as householder his speech brings prosperity.\
> But if that man goes forth,\
> speaking often to the people,\
> they'll be persuaded by his fair words."

## 30. A Lion-Like Jaw

"Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human
being. He refrained from talking nonsense. His words were timely, true,
and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. He said things
at the right time which were valuable, reasonable, succinct, and
beneficial. Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly
realm. When he came back to this place he obtained this mark: his jaw is
like that of a lion.[^255]

Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning
monarch. And what does he obtain as king? He can't be destroyed by any
human foe or enemy. That's what he obtains as king. And what does he
obtain as Buddha? He can't be destroyed by any foe or enemy whether
internal or external; nor by greed, hate, or delusion; nor by any
ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone
in the world. That's what he obtains as Buddha." The Buddha spoke this
matter.

On this it is said:

> "Neither nonsensical nor silly,\
> his way of speaking was never loose.\
> He eliminated what was unbeneficial,\
> and spoke for the welfare\
> \>and happiness of the people.
>
> So doing he passed from here to be reborn in heaven,\
> where he enjoyed the fruit of deeds well done.\
> Passing away, on his return to here,\
> he gained a jaw like the finest of beasts.
>
> He became a king so very hard to defeat,\
> a mighty lord and ruler of men.\
> He was equal to the best\
> \>in the city of the Three and Thirty,\
> like Indra, the finest of gods.
>
> One such as that is not easily beaten by centaurs,\
> titans, spirits, monsters, or gods.\
> If he becomes of such a kind,\
> he illuminates the quarters and in-between."

## 31--32. Even and White Teeth

"Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human
being. He gave up wrong livelihood and earned a living by right
livelihood. He refrained from falsifying weights, metals, or measures;
bribery, fraud, cheating, and duplicity; mutilation, murder, abduction,
banditry, plunder, and violence. Due to performing, accumulating,
heaping up, and amassing those deeds, when his body broke up, after
death, he was reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. There he
surpassed the other gods in ten respects: heavenly lifespan, beauty,
happiness, glory, sovereignty, sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and
touches. When he came back to this place he obtained these two marks:
his teeth are even and perfectly white.[^256]

Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a king, a
wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends
to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he
possesses the seven treasures. He has the following seven treasures: the
wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder,
and the commander as the seventh treasure. He has over a thousand sons
who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies. After
conquering this land girt by sea---free of harassment by bandits,
successful and prosperous, safe, blessed, and untroubled---he reigns by
principle, without rod or sword.[^257] And what does he obtain as king?
His retinue is pure. This includes brahmins and householders, people of
town and country, finance ministers, military officers, guardsmen,
ministers, councillors, rulers, tax beneficiaries, and princes. That's
what he obtains as king.

But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a
perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the
world. And what does he obtain as Buddha? His retinue is pure. This
includes monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, humans, titans, dragons,
and centaurs. That's what he obtains as Buddha." The Buddha spoke this
matter.

On this it is said:

> "He abandoned wrong livelihood, and created\
> a way of life that's fair, pure, and just.\
> He eliminated what was unbeneficial,\
> and lived for the welfare and happiness of the people.
>
> Having done what's praised\
> \>by the clever, the wise, and the good,\
> that man experienced the fruit in heaven.\
> Equal to the best in the heaven of Three and Thirty,\
> he enjoyed himself with pleasure and play.
>
> From there he passed back to a human life.\
> With the remaining ripening\
> \>of the fruit of good deeds,\
> he obtained teeth that are even,\
> gleaming, bright, and white.
>
> Many soothsayers regarded as wise men\
> gathered and predicted of him:\
> 'With twice-born teeth\
> \>so even, so white, so clean and bright\
> his retinue will be so pure.
>
> As king, his people will also be pure,\
> when he rules having conquered this earth so broad.\
> They won't harm the country,\
> but will live for the welfare\
> \>and happiness of the people.
>
> But if he goes forth he'll be an ascetic free of ill,\
> his passions quelled, the veil drawn back.\
> Rid of stress and weariness,\
> he sees this world and the next.
>
> Those who do his bidding, both lay and renunciate,\
> shake off wickedness, impure and blameworthy.\
> He's surrounded by pure people, who dispel\
> stains, callousness, sin, and corruptions.'"

That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants approved what
the Buddha said.
