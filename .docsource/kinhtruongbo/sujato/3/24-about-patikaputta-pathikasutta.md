# DN 24 About Pāṭikaputta  *Pāthikasutta*

## 1. The Story of Sunakkhatta

So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in the
land of the Mallas, near the Mallian town named Anupiya.[^1] Then the
Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered
Anupiya for alms. Then it occurred to him, "It's too early to wander for
alms in Anupiya. Why don't I go to visit the wanderer of the Bhaggava
clan in his monastery?"[^2]

So that's what he did. Then the wanderer of the Bhaggava clan said to
the Buddha, "Let the Blessed One come, sir! Welcome to the Blessed One,
sir! It's been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.
Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready."

The Buddha sat on the seat spread out, while the wanderer of the
Bhaggava clan took a low seat, sat to one side, and said to the Buddha,
"Sir, a few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me and said:[^3]
'Now, Bhaggava, I have rejected the Buddha. Now I no longer live
dedicated to him.' Sir, is what Sunakkhatta said true?"

"Indeed it is, Bhaggava.

A few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me, bowed, sat down to
one side, and said: 'Now I reject the Buddha! Now I shall no longer live
dedicated to you.'

When Sunakkhatta said this, I said to him, 'But Sunakkhatta, did I ever
say to you: "Come, live dedicated to me"?'[^4]

'No, sir.'

'Or did you ever say to me: "Sir, I shall live dedicated to the
Buddha"?'

'No, sir.'

'So it seems that I did not ask you to live dedicated to me, nor did you
say you would live dedicated to me. In that case, you futile man, who
are you and what are you rejecting? See how far you have strayed!'

'But sir, the Buddha never performs any superhuman demonstrations of
psychic power for me.'[^5]

'But Sunakkhatta, did I ever say to you: "Come, live dedicated to me and
I will perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power for you"?'

'No, sir.'

'Or did you ever say to me: "Sir, I shall live dedicated to the Buddha,
and the Buddha will perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power
for me"?'

'No, sir.'

'So it seems that I did not ask this of you, and you did not require it
of me. In that case, you futile man, who are you and what are you
rejecting? What do you think, Sunakkhatta? Whether or not there is a
demonstration of psychic power, does my teaching lead someone who
practices it to the goal of the complete ending of suffering?'

'It does, sir.'

'So it seems that whether or not there is a demonstration of psychic
power, my teaching leads someone who practices it to the goal of the
complete ending of suffering. In that case, what is the point of
superhuman demonstrations of psychic power? See how far you have
strayed, you silly man!'

'But sir, the Buddha never describes the origin of the world to me.'

'But Sunakkhatta, did I ever say to you: "Come, live dedicated to me and
I will describe the origin of the world to you"?'

'No, sir.'

'Or did you ever say to me: "Sir, I shall live dedicated to the Buddha,
and the Buddha will describe the origin of the world to me"?'

'No, sir.'

'So it seems that I did not ask this of you, and you did not require it
of me. In that case, you futile man, who are you and what are you
rejecting? What do you think, Sunakkhatta? Whether or not the origin of
the world is described, does my teaching lead someone who practices it
to the goal of the complete ending of suffering?'

'It does, sir.'

'So it seems that whether or not the origin of the world is described,
my teaching leads someone who practices it to the goal of the complete
ending of suffering. In that case, what is the point of describing the
origin of the world? See how far you have strayed, you silly man!

In many ways, Sunakkhatta, you have praised me like this in the Vajjian
capital: "That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha,
accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world,
supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans,
awakened, blessed."

In many ways you have praised the teaching like this in the Vajjian
capital: "The teaching is well explained by the Buddha---apparent in the
present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so
that sensible people can know it for themselves."

In many ways you have praised the Saṅgha like this in the
Vajjian capital: "The Saṅgha of the Buddha's disciples is
practicing the way that's good, sincere, systematic, and proper. It
consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the
Saṅgha of the Buddha's disciples that is worthy of
offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a
religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the
supreme field of merit for the world."

I declare this to you, Sunakkhatta, I announce this to you! There will
be those who say that Sunakkhatta was unable to lead the spiritual life
under the ascetic Gotama. That's why he resigned the training and
returned to a lesser life. That's what they'll say.'

Though I spoke to Sunakkhatta like this, he still left this teaching and
training, like someone on the highway to hell.

## 2. On the Aristocrat of Kuru

Bhaggava, this one time I was staying in the land of the Kurus where
they have a town named Uttarakā.[^6] Then I robed up in the
morning and, taking my bowl and robe, entered Uttarakā for
alms with Sunakkhatta the Licchavi as my second monk. Now at that time a
naked ascetic who was an aristocrat of Kuru had taken a vow to behave
like a dog. When food is tossed on the ground, he gets down on all
fours, eating and devouring it just with his mouth.[^7]

Sunakkhatta saw him doing this and thought, 'That ascetic is a holy
man!'[^8]

Then, knowing Sunakkhatta's train of thought, I said to him, 'Don't you
claim to be an ascetic who follows the Sakyan, you silly man?'

'But why does the Buddha say this to me?'

'When you saw that naked ascetic of Kuru, didn't you think, "That
ascetic is a holy man!"?'

'Yes, sir. But sir, are you jealous of the perfected ones?'

'I'm not jealous of the perfected ones, you silly man. Rather, you
should give up this harmful misconception that has arisen in you. Don't
create lasting harm and suffering for yourself!

That naked ascetic the aristocrat of Kuru, who you imagine to be a holy
man, will die of flatulence in seven days.[^9] And when he dies, he'll
be reborn in the very lowest rank of titans, named the
Kālakañjas.[^10] And they'll throw him in the charnel
ground on a clump of vetiver. If you wish, Sunakkhatta, go to the
aristocrat of Kuru and ask him whether he knows his own destiny. It's
possible that he will answer: "Reverend Sunakkhatta, I know my own
destiny. I've been reborn in the very lowest rank of titans, named the
Kālakañjas."'

So, Bhaggava, Sunakkhatta went to see the aristocrat of Kuru and said to
him, 'Reverend aristocrat of Kuru, the ascetic Gotama has declared that
you will die of flatulence in seven days. And when you die, you'll be
reborn in the very lowest rank of titans, named the
Kālakañjas. And when you die, they'll throw you in the
charnel ground on a clump of vetiver. But by eating just a little food
and drinking just a little water, you'll prove what the ascetic Gotama
says to be false.'

Then Sunakkhatta counted up the days until the seventh day, as happens
when you have no faith in the Realized One. But on the seventh day, the
naked ascetic who was an aristocrat of Kuru died of flatulence. And when
he passed away, he was reborn in the very lowest rank of titans, named
the Kālakañjas. And when he passed away, they threw him in
the charnel ground on a clump of vetiver.

Sunakkhatta the Licchavi heard about this. So he went to see the
aristocrat of Kuru in the charnel ground on the clump of vetiver. There
he struck him with his fist three times, 'Reverend aristocrat of Kuru,
do you know your destiny?'

Then the aristocrat of Kuru got up, rubbing his back with his hands, and
said,[^11] 'Reverend Sunakkhatta, I know my own destiny. I've been
reborn in the very lowest rank of titans, named the
Kālakañjas.' After speaking, he fell flat right there.

Then Sunakkhatta came to me, bowed, and sat down to one side. I said to
him, 'What do you think, Sunakkhatta? Did the prediction I made about
the aristocrat of Kuru turn out to be correct, or not?'

'It turned out to be correct.'

'What do you think, Sunakkhatta? If that is so, has a superhuman
demonstration of psychic power been performed or not?'

'Clearly, sir, a superhuman demonstration of psychic power has been
performed.'

'Though I performed such a superhuman demonstration of psychic power you
say this: "But sir, the Buddha never performs any superhuman
demonstrations of psychic power for me." See how far you have strayed!'
Though I spoke to Sunakkhatta like this, he still left this teaching and
training, like someone on the highway to hell.

## 3. On the Naked Ascetic Kaḷāramaṭṭaka

This one time, Bhaggava, I was staying near Vesālī, at the
Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Now at that time the naked
ascetic Kaḷāramaṭṭaka was residing in Vesālī.
And in the Vajjian capital he had reached the peak of material things
and fame.[^12] He had undertaken these seven vows.[^13] 'As long as I
live, I will be a naked ascetic, not wearing clothes. As long as I live,
I will be celibate, not having sex. As long as I live, I will consume
only meat and beer, not eating rice and porridge.[^14] And I will not go
past the following tree-shrines near Vesālī: the Udena
shrine to the east, the Gotamaka to the south, the Seven Maidens to the
west, and the Many Sons to the north.'[^15] And it was due to
undertaking these seven vows that he had reached the peak of material
things and fame.

So, Bhaggava, Sunakkhatta went to see Kaḷāramaṭṭaka and
asked him a question. But when it stumped him, he displayed annoyance,
hate, and bitterness. So Sunakkhatta thought, 'I've offended the holy
man, the perfected one, the ascetic.[^16] I mustn't create lasting harm
and suffering for myself!'

Then Sunakkhatta came to me, bowed, and sat down to one side. I said to
him, 'Don't you claim to be an ascetic who follows the Sakyan, you silly
man?'

'But why does the Buddha say this to me?'

'Didn't you go to see the naked ascetic Kaḷāramaṭṭaka and
ask him a question? But when it stumped him, he displayed annoyance,
hate, and bitterness. Then you thought, "I've offended the holy man, the
perfected one, the ascetic. I mustn't create lasting harm and suffering
for myself!"'

'Yes, sir. But sir, are you jealous of perfected ones?'

'I'm not jealous of the perfected ones, you silly man. Rather, you
should give up this harmful misconception that has arisen in you. Don't
create lasting harm and suffering for yourself!

That naked ascetic Kaḷāramaṭṭaka, who you imagine to be a
true holy man, will shortly be clothed, living with a partner, eating
rice and porridge, having gone past all the shrines near
Vesālī. And he will die after losing all his fame.'

And that's exactly what happened.

Sunakkhatta heard about this. He came to me, bowed, and sat down to one
side. I said to him, 'What do you think, Sunakkhatta? Did the
declaration I made about Kaḷāramaṭṭaka turn out to be
correct, or not?'

'It turned out to be correct.'

'What do you think, Sunakkhatta? If that is so, has a superhuman
demonstration of psychic power been performed or not?'

'Clearly, sir, a superhuman demonstration of psychic power has been
performed.'

'Though I perform such a superhuman demonstration of psychic power you
say this: "But sir, the Buddha never performs any superhuman
demonstrations of psychic power for me." See how far you have strayed!'
Though I spoke to Sunakkhatta like this, he still left this teaching and
training, like someone on the highway to hell.

## 4. On the Naked Ascetic Pāṭikaputta

This one time, Bhaggava, I was staying right there near
Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked
roof. Now at that time the naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta was
residing in Vesālī. And in the Vajjian capital he had
reached the peak of material things and fame.[^17] He was telling a
crowd in Vesālī: 'Both the ascetic Gotama and I speak from
knowledge.[^18] One who speaks from knowledge ought to display a
superhuman demonstration of psychic power to another who speaks from
knowledge. If the ascetic Gotama meets me half-way, there we should both
perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power. If he performs one
demonstration of psychic power, I'll perform two. If he performs two,
I'll perform four. If he performs four, I'll perform eight. However many
demonstrations of psychic power the ascetic Gotama performs, I'll
perform double.'

Then Sunakkhatta came to me, bowed, sat down to one side, and told me of
all this.

I said to him, 'Sunakkhatta, the naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta
is not capable of meeting me face to face, unless he gives up that
statement and that intention, and lets go of that view. If he thinks he
can meet me face to face without giving up those things, his head may
explode.'

'Careful what you say, Blessed One! Careful what you say, Holy One!'

'But why do you say this to me, Sunakkhatta?'

'Sir, the Buddha has categorically asserted that
Pāṭikaputta is not capable of meeting the Buddha face to
face, otherwise his head may explode. But Pāṭikaputta might
meet the Buddha face to face in disguise, proving the Buddha wrong.'

'Sunakkhatta, would the Realized One make an ambiguous statement?'[^19]

'But sir, did you make that statement after comprehending
Pāṭikaputta's mind with your mind? Or did deities tell you
about it?'

'Both, Sunakkhatta. For Ajita the Licchavi general has recently passed
away and been reborn in the host of the thirty-three. He came and told
me this, "The naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta is shameless, sir,
he is a liar. For he has declared of me in the Vajjian capital: 'Ajita
the Licchavi general has been reborn in the Great Hell.'

But that is not true---I have been reborn in the host of the
thirty-three. The naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta is shameless,
sir, he is a liar. Pāṭikaputta is not capable of meeting
the Buddha face to face, otherwise his head may explode."

Thus I both made that statement after comprehending
Pāṭikaputta's mind with my mind, and deities told me about
it.

So Sunakkhatta, I'll wander for alms in Vesālī. After the
meal, on my return from almsround, I'll go to Pāṭikaputta's
monastery for the day's meditation. Now you may tell him, if you so
wish.'

## 5. On Demonstrations of Psychic Power

Then, Bhaggava, I robed up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe,
entered Vesālī for alms. After the meal, on my return from
almsround, I went to Pāṭikaputta's monastery for the day's
meditation. Then Sunakkhatta rushed into Vesālī to see the
very well-known Licchavis and said to them, 'Sirs, after his almsround,
the Buddha has gone to Pāṭikaputta's monastery for the
day's meditation. Come forth, sirs, come forth! There will be a
superhuman demonstration of psychic power by the holy ascetics!' So the
very well-known Licchavis thought, 'It seems there will be a superhuman
demonstration of psychic power by the holy ascetics! Let's go!'

Then he went to see the very well-known well-to-do brahmins, rich
householders, and ascetics and brahmins who follow various other
religions, and said the same thing. They all said, 'It seems there will
be a superhuman demonstration of psychic power by the holy ascetics!
Let's go!'

Then all those very well-known people went to Pāṭikaputta's
monastery. That assembly was large, Bhaggava; there were many hundreds,
many thousands of them.

Pāṭikaputta heard, 'It seems that very well-known
Licchavis, well-to-do brahmins, rich householders, and ascetics and
brahmins who follow various other religions have come forth. And the
ascetic Gotama is sitting in my monastery for the day's meditation.'
When he heard that, he became frightened, scared, his hair standing on
end. In fear he went to the Pale-Moon Ebony Trunk Monastery of the
wanderers.

The assembly heard of this, and instructed a man, 'Come, my man, go to
see Pāṭikaputta at the Pale-Moon Ebony Trunk Monastery and
say to him, "Come forth, Reverend Pāṭikaputta! All these
very well-known people have come forth, and the ascetic Gotama is
sitting in your monastery for the day's meditation. For you stated this
in the assembly at Vesālī: 'Both the ascetic Gotama and I
speak from knowledge. One who speaks from knowledge ought to display a
superhuman demonstration of psychic power to another who speaks from
knowledge. If the ascetic Gotama meets me half-way, there we should both
perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power. If he performs one
demonstration of psychic power, I'll perform two. If he performs two,
I'll perform four. If he performs four, I'll perform eight. However many
demonstrations of psychic power the ascetic Gotama performs, I'll
perform double.' Come forth, Reverend Pāṭikaputta,
half-way. The ascetic Gotama has come the first half, and is sitting in
your monastery."'

'Yes, sir,' replied that man, and delivered the message.

When he had spoken, Pāṭikaputta said: 'I'm coming, sir, I'm
coming!' But wriggle as he might, he couldn't get up from his seat. Then
that man said to Pāṭikaputta, 'What's up, Reverend
Pāṭikaputta? Is your bottom stuck to the bench, or is the
bench stuck to your bottom? You say "I'm coming, sir, I'm coming!" But
wriggle as you might, you can't get up from your seat.' And as he was
speaking, Pāṭikaputta said: 'I'm coming, sir, I'm coming!'
But wriggle as he might, he couldn't get up from his seat.

When that man knew that Pāṭikaputta had lost, he returned
to the assembly and said, 'Pāṭikaputta has lost, sirs. He
says "I'm coming, sir, I'm coming!" But wriggle as he might, he can't
get up from his seat.' When he said this, I said to the assembly, 'The
naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta is not capable of meeting me face
to face, unless he gives up that statement and that intention, and lets
go of that view. If he thinks he can meet me face to face without giving
up those things, his head may explode.'


Then, Bhaggava, a certain Licchavi minister stood up and said to the
assembly, 'Well then, sirs, wait an hour, I'll go. Hopefully I'll be
able to lead Pāṭikaputta back to the assembly.'

So that minister went to see Pāṭikaputta and said, 'Come
forth, Reverend Pāṭikaputta! It's best for you to come
forth. All these very well-known people have come forth, and the ascetic
Gotama is sitting in your monastery for the day's meditation. You said
you'd meet the ascetic Gotama half-way. The ascetic Gotama has come the
first half, and is sitting in your monastery. The ascetic Gotama has
told the assembly that you're not capable of meeting him face to face.
Come forth, Pāṭikaputta! When you come forth we'll make you
win and the ascetic Gotama lose.'

When he had spoken, Pāṭikaputta said: 'I'm coming, sir, I'm
coming!' But wriggle as he might, he couldn't get up from his seat. Then
the minister said to Pāṭikaputta, 'What's up, Reverend
Pāṭikaputta? Is your bottom stuck to the bench, or is the
bench stuck to your bottom? You say "I'm coming, sir, I'm coming!" But
wriggle as you might, you can't get up from your seat.' And as he was
speaking, Pāṭikaputta said: 'I'm coming, sir, I'm coming!'
But wriggle as he might, he couldn't get up from his seat.

When the Licchavi minister knew that Pāṭikaputta had lost,
he returned to the assembly and said, 'Pāṭikaputta has
lost, sirs.' When he said this, I said to the assembly,
'Pāṭikaputta is not capable of meeting me face to face,
otherwise his head may explode. Even if the good Licchavis were to
think, "Let's bind Pāṭikaputta with straps and drag him
with a pair of oxen!" But either the straps will break or
Pāṭikaputta will.'

Then, Bhaggava, Jāliya, the pupil of the wood-bowl ascetic,
stood up and said to the assembly, 'Well then, sirs, wait an hour, I'll
go. Hopefully I'll be able to lead Pāṭikaputta back to the
assembly.'

So Jāliya went to see Pāṭikaputta and said,
'Come forth, Reverend Pāṭikaputta! It's best for you to
come forth. All these very well-known people have come forth, and the
ascetic Gotama is sitting in your monastery for the day's meditation.
You said you'd meet the ascetic Gotama half-way. The ascetic Gotama has
come the first half, and is sitting in your monastery. The ascetic
Gotama has told the assembly that you're not capable of meeting him face
to face. And he said that even if the Licchavis try to bind you with
straps and drag you with a pair of oxen, either the straps will break or
you will. Come forth, Pāṭikaputta! When you come forth
we'll make you win and the ascetic Gotama lose.'

When he had spoken, Pāṭikaputta said: 'I'm coming, sir, I'm
coming!' But wriggle as he might, he couldn't get up from his seat. Then
Jāliya said to Pāṭikaputta, 'What's up,
Reverend Pāṭikaputta? Is your bottom stuck to the bench, or
is the bench stuck to your bottom? You say "I'm coming, sir, I'm
coming!" But wriggle as you might, you can't get up from your seat.' And
as he was speaking, Pāṭikaputta said: 'I'm coming, sir, I'm
coming!' But wriggle as he might, he couldn't get up from his seat.

When Jāliya knew that Pāṭikaputta had lost, he
said to him,

'Once upon a time, Reverend Pāṭikaputta, it occurred to a
lion, king of beasts, "Why don't I make my lair near a certain forest?
Towards evening I can emerge from my den, yawn, look all around the four
quarters, roar my lion's roar three times, and set out on the hunt.
Having slain the very best of the deer herd, and eaten the most tender
flesh, I could return to my den."

And so that's what he did.

Now, there was an old jackal who had grown fat on the lion's leavings,
becoming arrogant and strong. He thought, "What does the lion, king of
beasts, have that I don't? Why don't I also make my lair near a certain
forest? Towards evening I can emerge from my den, yawn, look all around
the four quarters, roar my lion's roar three times, and set out on the
hunt. Having slain the very best of the deer herd, and eaten the most
tender flesh, I could return to my den."

And so that's what he did. But when he tried to roar a lion's roar, he
only managed to squeal and yelp like a jackal. And what is a pathetic
jackal's squeal next to the roar of a lion?

In the same way, reverend, while living off the leavings of the Holy
One, enjoying the leftovers of the Holy One, you presume to attack the
Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha![^20] Who are
the pathetic Pāṭikaputtas to attack the Realized Ones, the
perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas?'

When Jāliya couldn't get Pāṭikaputta to shift
from his seat even with this simile, he said to him:

> 'Seeing himself as equal to the lion,\
> the jackal presumed "I'm the king of the beasts!"\
> But he actually only managed to yelp,\
> and what's a sad jackal's squeal to the roar of a lion?

In the same way, reverend, while living off the leavings of the Holy
One, you presume to attack him!'

When Jāliya couldn't get Pāṭikaputta to shift
from his seat even with this simile, he said to him:

> 'Following in the steps of another,\
> seeing himself grown fat on scraps,\
> until he doesn't even see himself,\
> the jackal presumes he's a tiger.
>
> But he actually only managed to yelp,\
> and what's a sad jackal's squeal to the roar of a lion?

In the same way, reverend, while living off the leavings of the Holy
One, you presume to attack him!'

When Jāliya couldn't get Pāṭikaputta to shift
from his seat even with this simile, he said to him:

> 'Gorged on frogs, and mice from the barn,\
> and carcasses tossed in the cemetery,\
> thriving in the great, empty wood,\
> the jackal presumed "I'm the king of the beasts!"\
> But he actually only managed to yelp,\
> and what's a sad jackal's squeal to the roar of a lion?

In the same way, reverend, while living off the leavings of the Holy
One, enjoying the leftovers of the Holy One, you presume to attack the
Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! Who are the
pathetic Pāṭikaputtas to attack the Realized Ones, the
perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas?'

When Jāliya couldn't get Pāṭikaputta to shift
from his seat even with this simile, he returned to the assembly and
said, 'Pāṭikaputta has lost, sirs. He says "I'm coming,
sir, I'm coming!" But wriggle as he might, he can't get up from his
seat.'

When he said this, I said to the assembly, 'The naked ascetic
Pāṭikaputta is not capable of meeting me face to face,
unless he gives up that statement and that intention, and lets go of
that view. If he thinks he can meet me face to face without giving up
those things, his head may explode. The good Licchavis might even think,
"Let's bind Pāṭikaputta with straps and drag him with a
pair of oxen!" But either the straps will break or
Pāṭikaputta will. Pāṭikaputta is not capable
of meeting me face to face, otherwise his head may explode.'

Then, Bhaggava, I educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired that
assembly with a Dhamma talk. I released that assembly from the great
bondage, and lifted 84,000 beings from the great swamp. Next I entered
upon the fire element, rose into the air to the height of seven palm
trees, and created a flame another seven palm trees high, blazing and
smoking. Finally I landed at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked
roof.[^21]

Then Sunakkhatta came to me, bowed, and sat down to one side. I said to
him, 'What do you think, Sunakkhatta? Did the declaration I made about
Pāṭikaputta turn out to be correct, or not?'

'It turned out to be correct.'

'What do you think, Sunakkhatta? If that is so, has a superhuman
demonstration of psychic power been performed or not?'

'Clearly, sir, a superhuman demonstration of psychic power has been
performed.'

'Though I perform such a superhuman demonstration of psychic power you
say this: "But sir, the Buddha never performs any superhuman
demonstrations of psychic power for me." See how far you have strayed!'

Though I spoke to Sunakkhatta like this, he still left this teaching and
training, like someone on the highway to hell.

## 6. On Describing the Origin of the World

Bhaggava, I understand the origin of the world. I understand this, and
what goes beyond it. Yet since I do not misapprehend that understanding,
I have realized quenching within myself. Directly knowing this, the
Realized One does not come to ruin.[^22]

There are some ascetics and brahmins who describe the origin of the
world in their tradition as created by the God Almighty, by the
Divinity. I go up to them and say, 'Is it really true that this is the
venerables' view?' And they answer, 'Yes'. I say to them, 'But how do
you describe in your tradition that the origin of the world came about
as created by the God Almighty, by the Divinity?' But they are stumped
by my question, and they even question me in return. So I answer them,

'There comes a time when, reverends, after a very long period has
passed, this cosmos contracts. As the cosmos contracts, sentient beings
are mostly headed for the realm of streaming radiance. There they are
mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, wandering in midair,
steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time.

There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, this
cosmos expands. As it expands an empty mansion of divinity appears. Then
a certain sentient being---due to the running out of their lifespan or
merit---passes away from that host of radiant deities and is reborn in
that empty mansion of divinity. There they are mind-made, feeding on
rapture, self-luminous, wandering in midair, steadily glorious, and they
remain like that for a very long time.

But after staying there all alone for a long time, they become
dissatisfied and anxious, "Oh, if only other beings would come to this
place."

Then other sentient beings---due to the running out of their lifespan or
merit---pass away from that host of radiant deities and are reborn in
that mansion of divinity in company with that being.[^23] There they too
are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, wandering in midair,
steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time.

Now, the being who was reborn there first thinks, "I am the Divinity,
the Great Divinity, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal
Seer, the Wielder of Power, God Almighty, the Maker, the Creator, the
First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been
born and those yet to be born. And these beings were created by me. Why
is that? Because first I thought, 'Oh, if only other beings would come
to this place.' Such was my heart's wish, and then these creatures came
to this place."

And the beings who were reborn there later also think, "This must be the
Divinity, the Great Divinity, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the
Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, God Almighty, the Maker, the
Creator, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those
who have been born and those yet to be born. And we were created by him.
Why is that? Because we see that he was reborn here first, and we
arrived later."

And the being who was reborn first is more long-lived, beautiful, and
illustrious than those who arrived later.

It's possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is
reborn in this place. Having done so, they go forth from the lay life to
homelessness. By dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort,
and right application of mind, they experience an immersion of the heart
of such a kind that they recollect that past life, but no further.

They say: "He who is the Divinity---the Great Divinity, the Vanquisher,
the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, God
Almighty, the Maker, the Creator, the First, the Begetter, the
Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be
born---by he we were created. He is permanent, everlasting, eternal,
imperishable, remaining the same for all eternity. We who were created
by that Divinity are impermanent, not lasting, short-lived, liable to
pass away, and have come to this place." Is this how you describe in
your tradition that the origin of the world came about as created by the
God Almighty, by the Divinity?'[^24]

They say, 'That is what we have heard, Reverend Gotama, just as you
say.'[^25]

Bhaggava, I understand the origin of the world. I understand this, and
what goes beyond it. Yet since I do not misapprehend that understanding,
I have realized quenching within myself. Directly knowing this, the
Realized One does not come to ruin.

There are some ascetics and brahmins who describe the origin of the
world in their tradition as due to those depraved by play. I go up to
them and say, 'Is it really true that this is the venerables' view?' And
they answer, 'Yes'. I say to them, 'But how do you describe in your
tradition that the origin of the world came about due to those depraved
by play?' But they are stumped by my question, and they even question me
in return. So I answer them,

'Reverends, there are gods named "depraved by play". They spend too much
time laughing, playing, and making merry. And in doing so, they lose
their mindfulness, and they pass away from that host of gods.[^26]

It's possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is
reborn in this place. Having done so, they go forth from the lay life to
homelessness. By dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort,
and right application of mind, they experience an immersion of the heart
of such a kind that they recollect that past life, but no further.

They say, "The gods not depraved by play don't spend too much time
laughing, playing, and making merry. So they don't lose their
mindfulness, and don't pass away from that host of gods. They are
permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, remaining the same for
all eternity. But we who were depraved by play spent too much time
laughing, playing, and making merry. In doing so, we lost our
mindfulness, and passed away from that host of gods. We are impermanent,
not lasting, short-lived, liable to pass away, and have come to this
place." Is this how you describe in your tradition that the origin of
the world came about due to those depraved by play?'

They say, 'That is what we have heard, Reverend Gotama, just as you
say.'

Bhaggava, I understand the origin of the world. Directly knowing this,
the Realized One does not come to ruin.

There are some ascetics and brahmins who describe the origin of the
world in their tradition as due to those who are malevolent.[^27] I go
up to them and say, 'Is it really true that this is the venerables'
view?' And they answer, 'Yes'. I say to them, 'But how do you describe
in your tradition that the origin of the world came about due to those
who are malevolent?' But they are stumped by my question, and they even
question me in return. So I answer them,

'Reverends, there are gods named "malevolent". They spend too much time
gazing at each other, so they grow angry with each other, and their
bodies and minds get tired. They pass away from that host of gods.

It's possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is
reborn in this place. Having done so, they go forth from the lay life to
homelessness. By dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort,
and right application of mind, they experience an immersion of the heart
of such a kind that they recollect that past life, but no further.

They say, "The gods who are not malevolent don't spend too much time
gazing at each other, so they don't grow angry with each other, their
bodies and minds don't get tired, and they don't pass away from that
host of gods. They are permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable,
remaining the same for all eternity. But we who were malevolent spent
too much time gazing at each other, so our minds grew angry with each
other, our bodies and minds got tired, and we passed away from that host
of gods. We are impermanent, not lasting, short-lived, liable to pass
away, and have come to this place." Is this how you describe in your
tradition that the origin of the world came about due to those who are
malevolent?'

They say, 'That is what we have heard, Reverend Gotama, just as you
say.'

Bhaggava, I understand the origin of the world. Directly knowing this,
the Realized One does not come to ruin.

There are some ascetics and brahmins who describe the origin of the
world in their tradition as having arisen by chance. I go up to them and
say, 'Is it really true that this is the venerables' view?' And they
answer, 'Yes'. I say to them, 'But how do you describe in your tradition
that the origin of the world came about by chance?' But they are stumped
by my question, and they even question me in return. So I answer them,

'Reverends, there are gods named "non-percipient beings".[^28] When
perception arises they pass away from that host of gods.

It's possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is
reborn in this place. Having done so, they go forth from the lay life to
homelessness. By dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort,
and right application of mind, they experience an immersion of the heart
of such a kind that they recollect the arising of perception, but no
further.

They say, "The self and the cosmos arose by chance. Why is that? Because
formerly I didn't exist, whereas now, having not existed, I've
transformed into the state of existing." Is this how you describe in
your tradition that the origin of the world came about by chance?'

They say, 'That is what we have heard, Reverend Gotama, just as you
say.'

I understand this, and what goes beyond it. Yet since I do not
misapprehend that understanding, I have realized quenching within
myself. Directly knowing this, the Realized One does not come to ruin.

Though I state and assert this, certain ascetics and brahmins
misrepresent me with the incorrect, hollow, false, untruthful claim:
'The ascetic Gotama has a distorted perspective, and so have his monks.

He says, "When one enters and remains in the liberation of the
beautiful, at that time one only perceives what is ugly."'

But I don't say that. I say this: 'When one enters and remains in the
liberation of the beautiful, at that time one only perceives what is
beautiful.'"

"They are the ones with a distorted perspective, sir, who regard the
Buddha and the mendicants in this way. Sir, I am quite confident that
the Buddha is capable of teaching me so that I can enter and remain in
the liberation on the beautiful."

"It's hard for you to enter and remain in the liberation on the
beautiful, since you have a different view, creed, and belief, unless
you dedicate yourself to practice with the guidance of tradition. Come
now, Bhaggava, carefully preserve the confidence that you have in me."

"If it's hard for me to enter and remain in the liberation on the
beautiful, since I have a different view, creed, and belief, unless I
dedicate myself to practice with the guidance of tradition, I shall
carefully preserve the confidence that I have in the Buddha."

That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the wanderer of the Bhaggava
clan approved what the Buddha said.
