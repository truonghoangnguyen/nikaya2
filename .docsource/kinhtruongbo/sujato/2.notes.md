[^1]: In the suttas, *apadāna* means "evidence", "traces
    left behind" ([DN
    27:16.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn27/en/sujato#16.4), [DN
    24:2.7.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn24/en/sujato#2.7.3), [MN
    15:3.32](https://suttacentral.net/mn15/en/sujato#3.32), [AN
    3.2:1.1](https://suttacentral.net/an3.2/en/sujato#1.1)). The sense
    here seems to have been "(story about) the traces that deeds leave
    behind". The sense "legend of past lives" probably grew out of this
    sutta, and later became the title of the collections of legends of
    past lives of the monks (Thera-apadāna) and nuns
    (Therī-apadāna).

[^2]: *Kareri* is evidently *Miliusa tomentosa*, known as *hoom* or
    *kari* in Hindi. It is related to the custard apple, not the curry
    tree (*Murraya koenigii*).

[^3]: "Past life" is *pubbenivāsa*, literally "former
    abode".

[^4]: At [MN 71:14.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn71/en/sujato#14.2) and
    [SN 42.9:4.5](https://suttacentral.net/sn42.9/en/sujato#4.5) the
    Buddha says he recollects ninety-one eons, which must refer back to
    the life of Vipassī. We shall see the origin of his
    name below.

[^5]: *Sikhī* means "crested one" and refers to a halo or
    crown. A story of him and his disciples is told at [SN
    6.14:8.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn6.14/en/sujato#8.3).

[^6]: *Vessabhū* is Sanskrit Viśvabhṛt. It
    means "all-bearing", probably originating as a word for the earth. A
    legendary king of the same name once ruled over the city of
    Avantī ([DN
    19:36.14](https://suttacentral.net/dn19/en/sujato#36.14)).

[^7]: Due to the appearance of four Buddhas in this cycle it is known as
    "fortunate" (*bhadda*). \| Stories from Kakusandha's day appear at
    [MN 50](https://suttacentral.net/mn50/en/sujato) and [SN
    15.20:2.8](https://suttacentral.net/sn15.20/en/sujato#2.8). There is
    no obvious etymology for his name, but perhaps it stems from *kaku*
    ("peak") and thus "the union of the peaks", a valley at the junction
    of mountains.

[^8]: The meaning of Koṇāgamana is unclear. In Sanskrit it
    is often spelled Kanakamuni, "the golden sage", while in the
    (dubious) Nigali Sagar Edict of Ashoka it is
    Konākamana. At [Thig
    16.1:71.1](https://suttacentral.net/thig16.1/en/sujato#71.1) we hear
    the past life of three nuns in the time of Koṇāgamana.

[^9]: Kassapa (Sanskrit Kaśyapa) means "tortoise". It is a
    common Brahmanical clan name, stemming from an ancient figure
    reckoned as the eldest of the "seven sages", to whom some Vedic
    verses are attributed. Details of the Buddha Kassapa's time are
    found at [MN 81](https://suttacentral.net/mn81/en/sujato), [SN
    15.20:4.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn15.20/en/sujato#4.1), and [SN
    48.57:3.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.57/en/sujato#3.1).

[^10]: These numbers make up a quasi-logarithmic scale: the time gaps
    multiply by three, while the number of Buddhas divides by two. In
    eon one there are four Buddhas. Thirty eons ago the number is
    halved, so they had two Buddhas. Twice-thirty eons before that, the
    number is halved again, to one Buddha, thus ending the scale.

[^11]: In ancient India, the "aristocrats" (*khattiya*) and the brahmins
    vied for the prestige of being the highest class. The traditional
    business of the aristocrats was land, politics, agriculture, and
    war, while the brahmins were a hereditary priestly caste who served
    as advisers and ritualists. It is said that the Buddha-to-be was
    born in whatever caste was most prestigious at the time so that his
    word would have the most impact. \| In this sutta, the Buddha simply
    refers to himself as "I" with no personal name. When the seven
    Buddhas are listed at [DN
    32:3.14](https://suttacentral.net/dn32/en/sujato#3.14), however, he
    is called Aṅgīrasa.

[^12]: The Koṇḍaññas (Sanskrit Kauṇḍinya)
    originated as the leading clan of the city of Kuṇḍina
    the capital of Vidarbha, which is probably modern Kaundinyapura on
    the Wardha River.

[^13]: Gotama is an ancient Brahmanical clan name, which like Kassapa
    stems from the Vedas and the seven sages. Why does the Buddha, an
    aristocrat, have a Brahmanical clan? During initiation by a
    Brahmanical family priest (*purohita*), an aristocrat was ritually
    determined to be a brahmin for a short time, during which he would
    assume the lineage name of the priest. After being restored as an
    aristocrat, he and his family would still be referred to by that
    name. Thus the Sakyans' *purohita* must have been of the Gotama
    lineage. Other examples of this practice include the Mallas who are
    called Vāseṭṭha ([DN
    16:5.19.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#5.19.2)) and
    Saccaka who is called Aggivessana ([MN
    35:4.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn35/en/sujato#4.2)). The Jain
    Ācārāṅgasūtra 2.15.15 records a similar situation, for
    while Mahāvīra was, like the Buddha, a *khattiya*, he
    was of the Kāśyapa *gotta*, and various relatives were
    assigned to Vāsiṣṭha, Kauṇḍinya, and
    Kauśika.

[^14]: *Stereospermum chelonoides*. Dictionaries of Pali and Sanskrit
    call this the "trumpet-flower tree", but that is more commonly used
    for *Oroxylum indicum*.

[^15]: *Puṇḍarīka* is the white lotus, but here it is the
    name of a tree. The commentary says this is *setamba*
    ("white-mango"). It is not, however, the mango variety known by that
    name today (*Mangifera caesia*), which is not found in India.

[^16]: *Shorea robusta*.

[^17]: *Albizia lebbeck*, sometimes still known by the old name of
    sirisa. Older sources sometimes call it an acacia.

[^18]: *Ficus racemosa*.

[^19]: *Ficus benghalensis*.

[^20]: *Ficus religiosa*, sacred to Buddhists, Jains, and Hindus alike.
    Ancient sources referred to it both as *assattha* (Sanskrit
    *aśvattha*) and *pippala*. Buddhists today simply call
    it the Bodhi (or Bo) tree.

[^21]: The number of disciples diminishes as we approach historical
    time.

[^22]: An extensive journey of the Buddha with 1,250 mendicants is
    documented in [Kd 6](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/sujato),
    at one point of which occurs the events of the Selasutta ([Snp
    3.7](https://suttacentral.net/snp3.7/en/sujato) and [MN
    91](https://suttacentral.net/mn91/en/sujato)). The Buddha is also
    accompanied by 1,250 mendicants in the
    Sāmaññaphalasutta ([DN
    2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato)) and the Parosahassasutta
    ([SN 8.8](https://suttacentral.net/sn8.8/en/sujato)).

[^23]: The son of King Dawn and Queen Radiant at the City of the Dawn,
    Sikhī is the streaming rays of sunrise. These names
    recall a solar myth.

[^24]: In Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa ch. 131, a
    Pabhāvatī, daughter of the king of Vidarbha, is said to
    have married Marutta, king of Vajjī.

[^25]: There is an Arunawati River in Maharashtra, not far from the
    ancient homeland of the Koṇḍaññas in
    Kuṇḍina.

[^26]: Vessabhū's parents King Goodfall and Queen Rainy
    recall a seasonal fertility myth, where they gave life to their son
    the earth, "the nourisher and bearer of all". Note, however the
    variants *suppatīta* ("well pleased") and
    *yasavatī* ("celebrated").

[^27]: The names of the brahmin fathers all refer to ritual offerings.
    Aggidatta means "offered to the fire".

[^28]: The names of the brahmin mothers all recall Indian *nakkhatta*.
    These are "constellations" or more properly "lunar mansions";
    segments of the sky through which the Moon passes and which are
    associated with certain stars or clusters. In the Atharvaveda
    system, Visākhā is the 16th lunar asterism (Libra).

[^29]: Based on the Ashoka pillar there, this is identified with modern
    Gotihawa, southeast of Kapilavastu in Nepal.

[^30]: "Offered in sacrifice".

[^31]: Several constellations are distinguished as "former" (*pubba*)
    and "later" (*uttara*). Since it lies between Visākhā
    and Dhanavatī, this may be the 21st constellation,
    Uttara Āṣāḍhā (Sagittarius/Capricorn).

[^32]: If the dubious Ashokan edict there is to be believed, this was
    traditionally identified with the town known today as Nigali Sagar
    near Kapilavastu in Nepal.

[^33]: "Offered to Brahmā". Many of the
    Jātakas feature a king of this name, usually said to
    reside in Benares.

[^34]: Dhanavatī means "wealthy", but it is also an
    alternate name for the 23rd constellation, *dhaniṣṭhā*
    (or *śraviṣṭā*, Delphinus).

[^35]: Kikī ("blue jay") appears in the story of the past
    Buddha Kassapa at [MN 81](https://suttacentral.net/mn81/en/sujato).

[^36]: Suddhodana means "white rice". He is mentioned by name at [Thag
    10.1:8.1](https://suttacentral.net/thag10.1/en/sujato#8.1), [Snp
    3.11:7.2](https://suttacentral.net/snp3.11/en/sujato#7.2), and [Kd
    1:54.1.4](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#54.1.4).

[^37]: Māyā means "illusion". She is mentioned by name at
    [Thag 10.1:8.2](https://suttacentral.net/thag10.1/en/sujato#8.2) and
    [Thig 6.6:6.2](https://suttacentral.net/thig6.6/en/sujato#6.2).

[^38]: "Principle of the teachings" is *dhammadhātu*. At
    [SN 12.32:18.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.32/en/sujato#18.1),
    Sāriputta's mastery of the *dhammadhātu*
    gives him the ability to answer any questions on the Dhamma.

[^39]: These characteristics of the birth of the Buddha-to-be are also
    found in [MN 123](https://suttacentral.net/mn123/en/sujato), where
    Ānanda quotes the Buddha, although the wording is a little different
    and three extra details are added at the start. In addition, this
    detail and that about emerging mindfully from the womb are found at
    [AN 4.127](https://suttacentral.net/an4.127/en/sujato). \| Normally
    in early Pali, the word *bodhisatta* is reserved for the
    Buddha-to-be once he has left home and is practicing "intent on
    awakening" (eg. [MN
    26:13.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn26/en/sujato#13.1)). This
    passage extends the usage back as far as the end of the immediate
    past life.

[^40]: "Normal" is *dhammatā*, a natural principle. This
    entire passage differs from the earliest concept of the bodhisatta
    ("one intent on awakening"), which in early texts is typically
    applied to Siddhattha after he left the home.

[^41]: The commentary identifies this realm of "utter darkness"
    (*andhakāratimisā*) with a cold hell realm. There is a
    corresponding Purāṇic hell called
    *andhatāmisra*. \| *Asaṁvutā* was
    translated by Ñāṇamoḷī as "abysmal", but this relies on
    a commentarial cosmology that is not found in the suttas. The sense,
    rather, is "boundless". The root harks back to the Vedic serpent
    Vṛtra who wraps the world in darkness. \|
    *Nānubhonti* ("makes no impression") is glossed in the
    commentary to [AN 4.127](https://suttacentral.net/an4.127/en/sujato)
    as *nappahonti* "ineffective".

[^42]: The light is a physical one, not just a metaphor. From this, it
    appears that sentient beings may be spontaneously reborn in
    interstellar space. Compare the problem of the "Boltzmann brain" in
    physics.

[^43]: These are the Four Great Kings, regarded as protector deities.

[^44]: The five precepts.

[^45]: While sensual pleasures provoke attachment, they are nonetheless
    a kind of pleasure and therefore a sign of virtue and good past
    kamma.

[^46]: This tragic detail is also mentioned in [Ud
    5.2](https://suttacentral.net/ud5.2/en/sujato). The Buddha is raised
    by a step-mother, which in our Buddha's case was Māyā's
    sister Mahāpajāpatī ([AN
    8.51:9.8](https://suttacentral.net/an8.51/en/sujato#9.8), [MN
    142:3.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn142/en/sujato#3.3)).

[^47]: Ten signifies fullness and completion, as for example the "ten
    directions". \| The notion that the term of pregnancy was "nine or
    ten months" is also found at Chāndogya
    Upaniṣad 5.9.1. In the Rig Veda it is typically "in the
    tenth month" (5.78.7, 10.84.3).

[^48]: In illustrations she is depicted standing while holding a tree in
    the pose known as *sālabhañjikā*, a common motif in
    Indian art representing the abundance of springtime.

[^49]: Kāsi is the nation of which Varanasi is the capital.
    Their cloth was of exceptional quality.

[^50]: This passage implies that Buddhahood was destined from the time
    of birth, which stands in contrast to the rest of the suttas, where
    Buddhahood was hard-won by the Bodhisatta's efforts while striving
    for awakening. \| "Stands firm on his own feet" signifies that he
    will be awakened by his own efforts. \| "North" is *uttara*, which
    is also "the beyond"; this predicts his attaining Nibbana. \| "Seven
    strides" signifies crossing over the vast cycles of birth and death,
    especially by developing the seven awakening factors. \| The "white
    parasol" signifies purity and royalty. \| "Surveying all quarters"
    signifies his universal knowledge. \| The "dramatic proclamation" is
    *āsabhiṁ vācaṁ*, literally the "voice of a
    bull". Other contexts show that this is is an expression emphasizing
    speech that is dramatic and imposing ([SN
    52.9:3.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn52.9/en/sujato#3.2), [DN
    28:1.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn28/en/sujato#1.5) = [SN
    47.12:5.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.12/en/sujato#5.2)). \| At
    Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.1.1 and
    Chāndogya Upaniṣad 5.1.1 the "vital
    breath" (*prāṇa*) is said to be "eldest and first"
    (*jyeṣṭhaśca śreṣṭhaśca*).

[^51]: Many of the details of the following account were later
    incorporated into the life of Gotama, under the principle that the
    major events of the lives of Buddhas follow a natural order.
    Nonetheless, they are not always consistent with other accounts in
    early texts. For example, in the Attadaṇḍasutta the
    Buddha says his going forth was prompted by disillusionment and fear
    due to chronic conflict and warfare ([Snp
    4.15](https://suttacentral.net/snp4.15/en/sujato)).

[^52]: In [Snp 3.11](https://suttacentral.net/snp3.11/en/sujato), the
    newborn Siddhattha is examined by the dark hermit Asita. These two
    versions are combined in later accounts.

[^53]: Asita did not look at the 32 marks, and he predicted only one
    destiny: that he would become a Buddha.

[^54]: Various "treasures" (*ratana*) or "gems" of a king are discussed
    in such texts as Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5.3.1.

[^55]: The marks are elsewhere listed in [DN
    30:1.2.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn30/en/sujato#1.2.1) and [MN
    91:9.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn91/en/sujato#9.1). Here I list
    the related marks in the Bṛhatsaṁhitā as identified by
    Nathan McGovern (*On the Origins of the 32 Marks of a Great Man*,
    Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, 2016,
    vol. 39, pp. 207--247).

[^56]: This echoes the posture of the newborn bodhisatta, and has the
    same meaning: that he will become awakened by "standing on his own
    two feet".

[^57]: These leave marks that were seen by Doṇa ([AN
    4.36:1.3](https://suttacentral.net/an4.36/en/sujato#1.3)). They are
    often depicted in Buddhist art, signifying the perfection and
    completeness of the traces that the Buddha leaves behind in his
    teachings and practice. Bṛhatsaṁhitā 69.17 lists
    several auspicious marks, including the wheel.

[^58]: Described as "abundantly long" at [DN
    30:1.12.8](https://suttacentral.net/dn30/en/sujato#1.12.8).

[^59]: Same at Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.36.

[^60]: Tender feet at Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.2.

[^61]: Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.2 has *śliṣtāṅgulī*
    ("compact or sticky fingers"). The commentary denies that the Pali
    *jāla* means a physical web. I think it means that the
    fingers and toes were usually held together rather than splayed,
    hence not letting things slip through the fingers.

[^62]: *Ussaṅkha* means "(curved) up like a shell", while
    Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.2 says "curved up like a tortoise". The
    descriptive verse at [DN
    30:1.21.12](https://suttacentral.net/dn30/en/sujato#1.21.12) shows
    that it refers to the tops of the feet.

[^63]: These are presumably the long, elegant rear calves of the Indian
    Blackbuck.

[^64]: This agrees with Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.35.

[^65]: Same at Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.8.

[^66]: Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.102 says kings have a shining
    complexion.

[^67]: Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.102 mentions a "clean complexion"
    (*śuddha*).

[^68]: Same at Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.5.

[^69]: Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.26 says those with hairs turning
    right become kings.

[^70]: Here *brahm-* is an adjective from √*brah* + *ma*, equivalent to
    the Sanskrit *bṛṁh*, having the sense "grown,
    extended". The Sanskrit form here is *bṛhadṛjugātra*.

[^71]: Hands, feet, shoulders, and chest ([DN
    30:1.13.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn30/en/sujato#1.13.5)).

[^72]: Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.18 compares not the chest but the
    hips with a lion.

[^73]: Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.27 says the heart is raised and
    muscular.

[^74]: Bṛhatsaṁhitā 69.13 has the same proportions without
    the simile. These are the normal human proportions, yet we cannot
    touch our knees without bending. The only way these marks could be
    reconciled is if the arms were extra long and the length of the legs
    below the knees was extra long as well. And this is exactly what we
    are told: the ankles are stretched and long, and the calves are like
    those of an antelope, whose rear calves are long proportionate to
    the thigh. Thus in this regard the marks appear to be internally
    consistent, though not describing normal human anatomy.

[^75]: "Ridged taste buds" is *rasaggasaggī*. *Rasa* can
    mean either "taste" or "nutrition", but the use of
    *ojā* in [DN
    30:2.9.8](https://suttacentral.net/dn30/en/sujato#2.9.8) confirms
    the latter. *Gasa* is "swallow" and per [DN
    30:2.7.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn30/en/sujato#2.7.4) it is the
    "conveyance of savor" (*rasaharaṇīyo*). *Agga* often
    means "best", but this is derived from the primary sense of "peak".
    The descriptors *uddhagga* ("raised") at [DN
    30:2.7.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn30/en/sujato#2.7.4) and
    *susaṇṭhitā* ("prominent") at [DN
    30:2.9.8](https://suttacentral.net/dn30/en/sujato#2.9.8) confirm
    that the latter is meant. The mark refers to taste buds raised in
    noticeable ridges on the tongue that absorb nutrition and aid
    digestion. It has often been interpreted as "excellent
    (*aggī*) sense (*gasa*) of taste (*rasa*)", but this,
    being imperceptible to others, is rather a secondary consequence of
    the mark.

[^76]: Even, gapless, and white teeth are at Bṛhatsaṁhitā
    68.52.

[^77]: Same at Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.53.

[^78]: At [Thig
    13.1:6.2](https://suttacentral.net/thig13.1/en/sujato#6.2)
    Ambapālī describes her eyes as *abhinīla*.
    While some Indians do indeed have blue eyes, this probably describes
    a black so deep it appears blue.

[^79]: Cows have long and elegant eyelashes.

[^80]: The *uṇhīsa* is depicted as a bulge on the Buddha's
    crown.

[^81]: This is the *dakkhiṇā*, the religious offering given
    in gratitude and respect for the services.

[^82]: His birth mother has passed away and there is no mention of a
    step-mother.

[^83]: Normally clairvoyance and related abilities are said to arise due
    to the power of the fourth *jhāna*, whereas here it
    comes naturally due to past kamma. After *jhāna* this
    ability is empowered by the radiant mind clear of hindrances,
    whereas here it seems to be a more limited ability to see clearly
    and in the dark.

[^84]: Vipassī's name is simply the personal form of the
    word made famous in Buddhist meditation, *vipassanā*.
    This is usually rendered as "insight", but the sense here is more
    like "clear seeing".

[^85]: Indian epistemology acknowledges two fundamental sources of
    knowledge: direct perception (*paccakkha*) and inference
    (*anumāna*). This passage shows that
    *vipassanā* includes both. I render
    *vipassanā* with "discernment" in an attempt to capture
    both nuances, rather than the standard "insight".

[^86]: Here begins the story of the four signs that led to
    Vipassī's going forth---an old man, a sick man, a dead
    man, and a renunciate. Later texts apply the same story to
    Siddhattha, indeed to all bodhisattvas. \| These four "signs"
    (*nimitta*) are also called "messengers of the gods", reckoned as
    five ([MN 130](https://suttacentral.net/mn130/en/sujato)) or three
    ([AN 3.36](https://suttacentral.net/an3.36/en/sujato)).

[^87]: *Antepuraṁ* ("royal compound") was the inner sanctum
    of the royal residence. Maximally it referred to the area enclosed
    by walls within which the ruling families and staff lived. It later
    became used in the more restricted sense of "harem".

[^88]: "Brood" is *pajjhāyati*. He is having an existential
    crisis.

[^89]: In any story of prophecy, efforts are made to avert it and they
    invariably fail. This is a recursive property of prophetic myth. If
    the prophecy were averted, the myth would not exist and we would not
    know of it; but because the myth does exist, we know how it ends and
    the prophecy must come true.

[^90]: An existential crisis takes its own time; it cannot be rushed.

[^91]: Neither reading *vilāta* or *milāta*
    appears to occur elsewhere in this sense. The commentary says it is
    a bier (*sivika*).

[^92]: "Renunciate" is *pabbajita* ("one who has gone forth"), one of
    the many words for religious ascetics. It is a general term and does
    not specify his affiliation.

[^93]: "Celebrate" is *sādhu*, the famous Buddhist words of
    approval and rejoicing still heard every day in
    Theravāda Buddhist cultures. It later acquired the
    meaning "renunciate" but does not have that sense in early Pali. The
    virtues that he celebrates are common values of Indian religions.

[^94]: His apparently sudden decision to go forth arises only after an
    extensive period of crisis and contemplation.

[^95]: The idea that a whole populace would follow the bodhisatta on his
    renunciate path occurs several times in the Jātakas.

[^96]: Following the PTS edition in omitting *janapada*, which is absent
    from the commentary and the parallel passage at [DN
    19:58.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn19/en/sujato#58.3).

[^97]: This is the only place *vāsūpagata* ("entered his
    dwelling") is added to this stock phrase.

[^98]: At [SN 12.4](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.4/en/sujato)--10 this
    same reflection is attributed to each of the seven past Buddhas,
    kicking off an investigation into dependent origination in reverse
    order, starting with the outcome: suffering. Here this is treated as
    a meditative contemplation, whereas the next sutta, [DN
    15](https://suttacentral.net/dn15/en/sujato)
    Mahānidānasutta, delves into the philosophical
    implications.

[^99]: The reflection shows how the bodhisatta is still digging into the
    trauma of discovering the reality of old age and death.

[^100]: *Yoniso maniskāra* ("rational application of mind")
    is a distinctively Buddhist term that literally means "applying the
    mind by way of source". It is mostly used in investigating
    causality, although over time it came to have a more general sense
    of "reflection, inquiry, attention".

[^101]: Here begins the sequence of dependent origination. I give basic
    definitions of terms here, and more details in [DN
    15](https://suttacentral.net/dn15/en/sujato). \| Rebirth is a
    necessary antecedent condition for old age and death. Note that it
    is not a *sufficient* condition for old age, for many die when
    young.

[^102]: Since there cannot be an end to the "birth" that starts this
    life, *jāti* means "rebirth", the next stage in the
    ongoing cycle.

[^103]: *Bhava* means "being, existence, life" in the sense of "past and
    future lives". It refers to the ongoing process of continued
    existence, transmigrating through life after life. By itself,
    *bhava* has a positive connotation, and represents the longing that
    many people have to continue to exist after death in a permanent and
    happy state. The Buddha, however, situates it as just one more
    dimension of the flow of conditions.

[^104]: "Grasping" (*upādāna*) at sensual pleasures, views,
    precepts and observances, and theories of a self ([DN
    15:6.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn15/en/sujato#6.3)). Grasping has
    the active sense of "taking up" a new life, not just "clinging" to
    what one has. It has a dual sense, because it also means the "fuel"
    that sustains the fire of existence.

[^105]: Craving (*taṇhā*, literally "thirst") and grasping
    have a similar meaning, but craving is primal desire while grasping
    is more complex, involving doctrines and behaviors.

[^106]: "Feeling" (*vedanā*) is more fundamental than the
    complex concept of "emotion". It refers to the hedonic tone of
    experience as pleasant, painful, or neutral.

[^107]: "Contact" is literally "touch" (*phassa*), and refers to the
    stimulation that occurs when sense object meets sense organ in
    experience.

[^108]: The five senses with the mind as sixth. This topic is treated
    extensively throughout early Buddhism, with a special focus on
    understanding and restraining the pull of sense stimulation.
    *Āyatana* has a root sense "stretch", from which derived senses
    include "dimension", "field", etc.

[^109]: "Name and form" (*nāmarūpa*) is a Vedic concept
    referring to the multiplicity of material forms
    (*rūpa*) and associated names (*nāma*),
    especially the individual "sentient organisms" such as gods and
    humans (Rig Veda 5.43.10, Bṛhadāraṇyaka
    Upaniṣad 1.6.1), which are ultimately absorbed into the
    divine, like rivers in the ocean (Muṇḍaka
    Upaniṣad 3.2.8, Praśna
    Upaniṣad 6.5). The Buddha treated "name" analytically
    as feeling, perception, intention, contact, and application of mind,
    and "form" as the four elements and derived matter ([DN
    15:20.8](https://suttacentral.net/dn15/en/sujato#20.8), [MN
    9:52--54.7](https://suttacentral.net/mn9/en/sujato#52-54.7), and [SN
    12.2:11.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.2/en/sujato#11.1)).

[^110]: "Consciousness" (*viññāṇa*) is simple subjective
    awareness, the sense of knowing. It arises stimulated by either an
    external sense impression or a mental phenomena such as thought,
    memory, etc. It is the subjective awareness that makes the entire
    multiform world of concepts and appearances possible. Thus far the
    analysis agrees with Yājñavalkya, who says that the
    manifold appearances in the world arise from consciousness (*etebhyo
    bhūtebhyaḥ samutthāya*,
    Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.12).

[^111]: Here the Buddha decisively departs from
    Yājñavalkya's view that individuated awareness
    (*saññā*) returns into "this great reality, infinite,
    unbounded, a sheer mass of consciousness" (*idaṁ
    mahadbhūtam anantam apāraṁ
    vijñānaghana eva*, Bṛhadāraṇyaka
    Upaniṣad 2.4.12). Consciousness
    (*viññāṇa*) is not a fundamental reality
    (*mahadbhūta*) underlying multiplicity, but rather a
    conditioned process that exists only together with name and form.

[^112]: Dependent origination normally continues with two further
    factors: choices and ignorance. The full series does not appear in
    the Dīghanikāya. This truncated series emphasizes the
    mutuality of name and form with consciousness, but does not preclude
    the normal linear series. Each presentation of dependent origination
    reveals a different aspect of a complex, ramified process.

[^113]: Note the use of repetition to sum up the main doctrinal
    teachings. This serves to lock the sequence in memory and ensure no
    items are missing or displaced, while for one who is reciting the
    text from memory it provides an opportunity to reflect and apply the
    meaning in their own experience.

[^114]: This phrasing recalls the Buddha's first sermon ([SN
    56.11:5.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11/en/sujato#5.1)), an
    insight that is said to be common to all Buddhas ([SN
    56.12:1.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.12/en/sujato#1.1)). *Pubbe
    ananussutesu* ("not learned before from another") means that this is
    a fresh insight not passed down in an oral tradition.

[^115]: The PTS edition has *vipassanā-maggo* here, despite
    admitting the term is found in no manuscripts and is taken from the
    commentary, where it is clearly an explanation not a reading
    (*maggoti vipassanāmaggo*). This error is followed by
    Rhys Davids and Walshe in their translations.

[^116]: Insight into dependent origination here indicates the attaining
    of stream entry.

[^117]: The five grasping aggregates
    (*pañcūpādānakkhandhā*) are mentioned as a summary of
    suffering in the Buddha's first sermon ([SN
    56.11:4.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11/en/sujato#4.2)). Most of
    the teachings on this topic are collected in the
    Khandhasaṁyutta at SN 22, but they are also found in
    the Dīghanikāya at [DN
    22:14.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn22/en/sujato#14.1), [DN
    33:1.11.45](https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#1.11.45), [DN
    33:2.1.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#2.1.4), and [DN
    34:1.6.16](https://suttacentral.net/dn34/en/sujato#1.6.16). The
    contemplation on the aggregates dispels the mistaken assumption of a
    self. Many of the theorists in [DN
    1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato) identify the self with
    one or other of the aggregates.

[^118]: *Saṅkhāra* in early Buddhism has three main
    doctrinal senses. (1) The broadest sense is "conditioned phenomena",
    which we find in the Dīghanikāya at [DN
    16:6.10.10](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#6.10.10), [DN
    17:2.16.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato#2.16.1), and [DN
    34:1.8.59](https://suttacentral.net/dn34/en/sujato#1.8.59). This
    essentially means "everything except Nibbana". (2) Sometimes it is a
    physical or mental "process" or "activity" as at [DN
    18:24.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn18/en/sujato#24.1), where it
    refers to the gradual stilling of energies in the development of
    meditation. (3) In the five aggregates and dependent origination it
    has the sense of "morally potent volitions or choices" and is a
    synonym for *cetanā* ("intention"). It is defined as
    good, bad, and imperturbable choices ([DN
    33:1.10.77](https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#1.10.77)), the
    latter of which refers to the kamma of the fourth
    *jhāna* and above. In this sense it is the moral
    "choices" for good or ill that propel consciousness into a new
    rebirth.

[^119]: The radical thesis of the Buddha's teaching is the idea that
    consciousness is merely another empirical phenomena that comes to an
    end, as is also emphasized in the concluding verses of [DN
    11](https://suttacentral.net/dn11/en/sujato).

[^120]: This indicates the attainment of arahantship, the complete
    release from all attachments leading to rebirth.

[^121]: No longer a bodhisatta, he is now called a Buddha for the first
    time.

[^122]: In early Buddhism, the idea of teaching the Dhamma only arose
    after awakening.

[^123]: A similar account is told of Gotama Buddha at [SN
    6.1:1.4](https://suttacentral.net/sn6.1/en/sujato#1.4), [MN
    26:19.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn26/en/sujato#19.2), and [MN
    85:43.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn85/en/sujato#43.2).

[^124]: Here "clinging" is *ālaya*, from a root meaning "to
    stick".

[^125]: "Specific conditionality" ( *idappaccayatā*) refers
    to the fact that dependent origination traces the specific
    conditions for other specific things: this conditions that. It is
    not a general principle of universal conditionality ("everything is
    interconnected").

[^126]: "Stilling of all activities"
    (*sabbasaṅkhārasamatho*) is the cessation of all
    conditioned energies or phenomena. \| "Attachments" here is
    *upadhi*, the things of the world to which we cling and which
    bolster our complacency.

[^127]: The commentary is careful to specify that the Buddha means
    physical exhaustion only.

[^128]: "Not supernaturally inspired" (*anacchariyā*)
    rejects the Vedic "channeling" of scripture from the Divinity, while
    "not learned before in the past" (*pubbe assutapubbā*),
    echoing the Dhammacakkappavattanasutta ([SN
    56.11:5.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11/en/sujato#5.1)), rejects
    the oral tradition.

[^129]: "Shrouded" is *āvuṭā*, which is from the same root
    as *asaṁvutā* in [DN
    14:1.17.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#1.17.5) above, as
    well as *nīvaraṇa* ("hindrance"). All these terms
    ultimately stem from the Vedic serpent Vṛtra ("the
    constrictor") who wraps the world in darkness.

[^130]: Had he followed this inclination he would have been a
    *paccekabuddha*, a Buddha "awakened for himself".

[^131]: In the accounts of Gotama's life this is specified as
    Brahmā Sahampati. This whole passage is a moment of
    high cosmic solemnity and drama.

[^132]: The Buddha teaches on the invitation of the highest divinity.
    This sets a precedent for Buddhists to refrain from proselytizing,
    but rather teach by invitation. These passages are still recited in
    some places to invite a teaching.

[^133]: *Aññātāro* is an agent noun in plural, literally
    "understanders".

[^134]: Previously he simply reflected to himself, now he uses his
    psychic abilities to ascertain people's spiritual potential.

[^135]: *Indriya* ("faculty") is an abstract noun from *indra*, the name
    of the potent Vedic god of war. In the Vedas, Indra manifests his
    *indriya* by drinking soma. The drug enables him to release his full
    potential and power; originally this probably referred to drinking
    an amphetamine-like substance before battle. Here we see that it
    means something like "spiritual potential" which is unleashed by the
    practice of the eightfold path.

[^136]: *Pamuñcantu saddhaṁ* has long troubled
    translators, as the basic sense of *pamuñcantu* is
    "release". The problem is a long-standing one, for Sanskrit variants
    include *pramodantu* ("celebrate") or *praṇudantu
    kāṅkṣāḥ* ("dispel doubts"). I think it is a poetic
    variant of *adhimuñcantu*, to "decide" or "commit" to
    faith. Pali commonly uses a synonymous verb to reinforce the sense
    of the noun. In [Snp
    5.19](https://suttacentral.net/snp5.19/en/sujato), *muttasaddho*,
    *pamuñcassu saddhaṁ*, and
    *adhimuttacittaṁ* are all used in this sense.

[^137]: In the account of Gotama, he first thinks to teach his former
    colleagues under whom he practiced the formless attainments. Here we
    see the start of a tendency in the legends of past Buddhas to erase
    the education among other spiritual teachers before awakening. Note
    that these two, who will become Vipassī's chief
    disciples, are leading *khattiya* and brahmin sons of the royal
    household. Khaṇḍa was Vipassī's brother,
    and the priest's son was virtually family.

[^138]: *Khema* ("sanctuary") originally meant "oasis". It is common
    name for lakes and nature parks in the Jātakas.

[^139]: There is a clear distinction between such managed "parks" and
    wilderness regions (*arañña*).

[^140]: In the early period, there was no distinction between "going
    forth" (*pabbajjā*) and "ordination"
    (*upasampadā*). They refer to two sides of the same
    coin: leaving the home life and entering the ascetic life.
    Ordination was originally granted with the simple call, "Come
    mendicant!" (*ehi bhikkhu*).

[^141]: Thus they became arahants, realizing the same truth that
    Vipassī had.

[^142]: As at [Kd
    1:11.1.4](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#11.1.4) and
    [SN 4.5:2.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn4.5/en/sujato#2.3). One of
    the Buddha's first acts is to empower his students.

[^143]: In the Vinaya of the current Buddha, the recitation occurs every
    fortnight on the *uposatha* ("sabbath"), and it includes only the
    mendicants resident in a specific monastery. Here they gathered from
    all over India.

[^144]: "Black Plum Tree Land" is *jambudīpa*, the South
    Asian subcontinent, including India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh,
    and Afghanistan. The number 84,000 does not seem excessive, as the
    Chinese pilgrims recorded many thousands of monasteries throughout
    India. In modern Thailand there are around 40,000 monasteries.

[^145]: The verses that follow form the climax of the whole discourse.
    They are known as the Ovāda Pātimokkha,
    the "monastic code for exhortation". It seems that they were recited
    on the *uposatha* in the days before the establishment of the list
    of rules that is also called *pātimokkha*. Most of the
    extant Vinayas still include these verses in the
    *pātimokkha* texts, the Pali being a notable exception.

[^146]: The Buddha redefines *tapas* from painful mortification to
    gentle acceptance.

[^147]: These verses speak of "Buddhas" in plural.

[^148]: These famous lines serve as a succinct summary of the entire
    Buddhist path.

[^149]: "Embrace" is *upasampadā*, to "enter into". It is
    the same word used for taking ordination as well as entering
    *jhāna*.

[^150]: Through meditation.

[^151]: The *buddhasāsana* ("instruction of the Buddha" or
    "dispensation of the Buddha") is the normal word used by Buddhists
    to refer to their own religion.

[^152]: Here "monastic code" means the principles outlined in these
    verses. They are spelled out in more detail in the Gradual Training
    ([DN 2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato), etc.), and
    ultimately in the detailed legal code of the
    Vinayapiṭaka.

[^153]: The "higher mind" is the four *jhānas* ([AN
    3.90:3.2](https://suttacentral.net/an3.90/en/sujato#3.2)).

[^154]: The Buddha now returns to the present life.
    Ukkaṭṭhā is the home of Pokkharasāti ([DN
    3:2.13.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato#2.13.1)) and the
    site of the astonishing and cosmically significant discourses [MN
    1](https://suttacentral.net/mn1/en/sujato) and [MN
    49](https://suttacentral.net/mn49/en/sujato).

[^155]: Only non-returners are born in the pure abodes
    (*suddhāvāsā*), from where they realize full awakening.

[^156]: "Order of gods" is *devanikāya*. I use "deity" to
    distinguish *devatā* from *deva* but there is no
    substantial difference.

[^157]: This is a list of the major events in any Buddha biography.

[^158]: The lifespan in such a realm can be many hundreds of eons.

[^159]: These are absent in the Pali text at this point, but they are
    mentioned below, and the commentary says they should be included
    here.

[^160]: This is the detailed answer to the question asked by the
    mendicants at [DN
    14:1.13.6](https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#1.13.6).

[^161]: This sutta with its commentary was translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi
    in his *The Great Discourse on Causation*. It is the longest and
    most complex discourse on dependent origination in early Buddhism.

[^162]: The Kurukṣetra was an ancient Brahmanical kingdom
    situated in the region around modern Delhi, bordered by the Ganges
    in the east, the Sarasvatī in the west, the Himalayas
    in the north, and the hills of the Aravalli Range in the south. The
    Mahābharata climaxes with the battle fought there
    between the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas. These events, to
    the extent that they can be established historically, took place
    several centuries before the Buddha. Kuru marks the north-western
    extent of the Buddha's travels. Kammāsadamma is
    identified with modern Kumashpur in Haryana, about 40 km north of
    Delhi.

[^163]: While we cannot date this text, the fact that Ānanda has
    evidently been studying deep matters for a long time, that it takes
    place outside the Buddha's accustomed locales, and that it builds on
    teachings found elsewhere, suggests that it happened rather late in
    the Buddha's life. At [SN
    12.60](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.60/en/sujato) we find the same
    introduction to a much shorter discourse.

[^164]: At [SN 6.1:1.6](https://suttacentral.net/sn6.1/en/sujato#1.6)
    (and [DN 14:3.1.6](https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#3.1.6) in
    the case of Vipassī), the Buddha hesitated to teach the
    Dhamma because dependent origination is so hard to see. Ānanda was
    not only learned and wise, he was a stream enterer who had directly
    experienced dependent origination ([AN
    10.92:6.1](https://suttacentral.net/an10.92/en/sujato#6.1)), yet he
    still underestimates it.

[^165]: The sutta introduce subtle variations in the standard formula as
    a means to illuminate hidden implications and dimensions.

[^166]: The Buddha establishes the primary purpose of dependent
    origination: to understand transmigration so as to be free from it.

[^167]: Dependent origination is here taught in "reverse order"
    (*paṭiloma*, [Ud
    1.2:1.4](https://suttacentral.net/ud1.2/en/sujato#1.4)), starting
    with the existential problem: we are all going to die. This factor
    and the next are resultant, so we cannot solve them directly.

[^168]: With this the Buddha denies the promise of immortality in this
    or any other realm.

[^169]: "Continued existence" (or "life") is an encompassing term,
    including both resultant and causal dimensions.

[^170]: "Grasping" and "craving" (together with "ignorance" in the full
    sequence) are the defilements that drive the process on. It is here
    that the practice of the path takes effect, uprooting them entirely.

[^171]: The next three factors spell out the process of sense experience
    that unfolds automatically. Meditation slows it down so it can be
    seen clearly, but the process remains even for the perfected ones.

[^172]: Here we encounter the first unique feature of this sequence, as
    normally the six sense fields appear as the condition for contact.
    The reason for this special presentation becomes clear later on.

[^173]: The mutual conditioning of consciousness with name and form is a
    further subtlety of this presentation. We have met this idea before
    in [DN 14:2.18.43](https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#2.18.43);
    it also occurs in [SN
    12.65](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.65/en/sujato) and [SN
    12.67](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.67/en/sujato). Again,
    implications of this are explored below.

[^174]: The sequence is recapped in forward order (*anuloma*, [Ud
    1.1:1.4](https://suttacentral.net/ud1.1/en/sujato#1.4)).

[^175]: The Buddha now takes up each of the terms in more depth.

[^176]: This emphatic phrasing drives home that "cessation" (*nirodha*)
    is not simply temporary suppression or non-arising, but permanent
    and complete absence.

[^177]: "Rebirth" (*jāti*) is defined as the birth of a new
    life, not as simple arising.

[^178]: The various terms for "cause" are used as synonyms (*hetu*,
    *nidāna*, *samudaya*, *paccaya*). The purpose of using
    different terms is not to add nuances, but to reinforce the central
    meaning and guard against the corruption of meaning; if one word is
    lost or misunderstood, the meaning of the sentence as a whole is not
    changed.

[^179]: These realms relate to the kamma that projects consciousness
    into them. The realms of "luminous form" (*rūpabhava*)
    and the "formless" (*arūpabhava*) are generated by the
    form and formless attainments respectively. Any other kamma, good or
    bad, pertains to the sensual realm (*kāmabhava*). All
    rebirth takes place in one or other of these realms.

[^180]: "Grasping" (*upādāna*) begins with the primal
    desire of the senses, but the three other graspings are rather
    intellectual and sophisticated. Only a grown human being with a
    developed linguistic ability is able to formulate a view to become
    attached to, and likewise with attachment to religious observances
    and vows, and to theories of a self. This is why the bulk of kamma
    is produced by adult humans, rather than by, say, animals or
    children, for whom these dimensions of grasping are nascent.

[^181]: "Craving" (*taṇhā*) is a fundamental desire or
    urge. Unlike grasping, it is fully active in children and animals.
    Often it has a threefold definition, which we find below, but in
    dependent origination it is usually defined in terms of the six
    senses, which relates it to the items to come.

[^182]: The usual threefold definition of feeling (pleasant, painful,
    neutral) is reframed in terms of the six senses.

[^183]: Here the Buddha introduces another, even more radical, departure
    from the typical sequence. Rather than continue back to contact and
    name and form, he branches out in an entirely new direction. These
    "nine things rooted in craving" are found independently at [AN
    9.23:1.2](https://suttacentral.net/an9.23/en/sujato#1.2) and [DN
    34:2.2.31](https://suttacentral.net/dn34/en/sujato#2.2.31), but only
    here are they integrated with the standard dependent origination.

[^184]: While the purpose of the main dependent origination is to
    disclose the web of conditions that generates the suffering of
    transmigration, here the Buddha looks at the arising of social
    conflict and disorder.

[^185]: In [DN 27](https://suttacentral.net/dn27/en/sujato)
    Aggaññasutta the Buddha narrates a legend showing how
    these things arise. The point is not that we should not safeguard
    (*ārakkha*) our possessions. It is, rather, that so
    long as we live in a world where safeguarding possessions is
    necessary, there will be conflict and violence.

[^186]: "Stinginess" is *macchariya*.

[^187]: There are many words in Pali that approximate the English word
    "attachment". Here it is *ajjhosāna*.

[^188]: "Evaluation" is *vinicchaya*. We like to weigh up and consider
    the pros and cons of different objects of desire.

[^189]: Those who have nothing are grateful for any small thing, and do
    not indulge in picking and choosing.

[^190]: Our senses are tuned to hunt out and acquire pleasure.

[^191]: This is the normal definition of craving in the four noble
    truths, supplementing the previous definition in terms of the six
    senses. Both are included in this sutta to show that they do not
    contradict, but rather reveal different aspects of the same thing.
    It is not just sensual desire that drives acquisition. For example,
    religious people fight over sacred ground or holy objects to gain a
    place in heaven; or else those driven by nihilism go to any lengths
    for alcohol or drugs to erase existence.

[^192]: The threefold analysis of feeling leads to the process of
    acquisition, while the sixfold analysis of feeling leads to
    dependent origination.

[^193]: And now we rejoin the main sequence.

[^194]: People mostly want to enjoy pleasant sensations, in this life
    and the next, but those sensations depend on a constant supply of
    the appropriate stimuli.

[^195]: Name and form are said to be conditions for contact also at [Snp
    4.11:11.1](https://suttacentral.net/snp4.11/en/sujato#11.1).

[^196]: The "set of mental phenomena known as name" is
    *nāmakāya*. Its function depends not any underlying
    essence, but on the "features" by which it is "made known"; this is
    a phenomenological analysis. \| "Labeling contact" is
    *adhivacanasamphassa*; it is the active process by which the mind
    makes sense of the world by attaching labels to experience. This
    passage reinforces the linguistic significance of
    *nāma*.

[^197]: The "set of physical phenomena known as form" is
    *rūpakāya*. \| "Impingement contact" is
    *paṭighasamphassa*. Here *paṭigha* refers
    to the "striking" of physical phenomena against each other, such as
    light "hitting" the eye. It most commonly appears in this sense in
    the formula that begins the formless attainments.

[^198]: Labeling moves from the mind to the world; impingement moves
    from the world to the mind. Together they create a dynamic two-way
    process by which we learn about the world and how to make sense of
    it.

[^199]: Contact is fundamentally a meeting, normally expressed as the
    coming together of the sense stimulus (light), the sense organ
    (eye), and sense consciousness. By skipping the direct mention of
    the six senses, the Buddha opens another perspective on this
    process: mental labeling meets sense impingement, each essential to
    the other, and together making contact possible. The analysis itself
    exemplifies this process, as it starts by looking at the process
    from each side, and moves towards integration, seeing them both
    together.

[^200]: Consciousness in dependent origination is normally defined as
    the six kinds of sense consciousness ([SN
    12:6.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn12/en/sujato#6.3)). The purpose
    of this is to emphasize that the process of rebirth and
    transmigration is an empirical process, which depends on the same
    ordinary consciousness we are experiencing now. Here, once again, by
    skipping the six senses, a new mode of analysis opens up, which
    emphasizes the organic growth of the individual.

[^201]: "Conceived" is *okkamissatha*, literally "descend" or "arrive".
    \| "Coagulate" assumes the PTS reading *samucchissatha* (Sanskrit
    *sammurch*). I believe this echoes the belief that the embryo is
    "coagulated" from the mix of blood and semen. \| Linguistically,
    this passage through to [DN
    15:22.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn15/en/sujato#22.2) is marked
    with the extremely rare verbal ending *-issatha*, which is the
    middle form of the third person singular conditional.

[^202]: "Miscarried" is *vokkamissatha*. \| "State of existence" is
    *itthattā*, which is most commonly found in the
    declaration of the arahant that they will no longer be reborn into
    "this state of existence". \| Here "born" is *abhinibbatti*, which
    is listed along with *jāti*, *okkanti*, and other terms
    as a synonym in the standard definition of rebirth ([SN
    12.2:4.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.2/en/sujato#4.2), [MN
    9:24--26.7](https://suttacentral.net/mn9/en/sujato#24-26.7), [DN
    22:18.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn22/en/sujato#18.4)).

[^203]: The connection between dependent origination and childhood
    development is further explored in [MN
    38:28.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn38/en/sujato#28.1).

[^204]: Now we turn to the mirror side of the pair of conditions.

[^205]: Just as name and form---the organic, sensual, and sense-making
    body---cannot grow without consciousness, so too consciousness must
    acquire a landing or grounding place to be "planted" in name and
    form. \| *Dukkhasamudayasambhavo* ("the coming to be of the origin
    of suffering") might be rendered "the coming to be and origin of
    suffering". However, *dukkhasamudaya* occurs some hundreds of times
    in the sense "origin of suffering" so I take it in the same way
    here. This is supported by the PTS variant reading *dukkhasamudayo
    sambhavo*.

[^206]: This passage continues to employ rare middle forms, this time
    *-etha*, the third person singular optative.

[^207]: This passage explains why the sequence ends here rather than
    proceeding in the usual way to choices and ignorance. Any state of
    being ultimately depends on the codependency of name and form with
    consciousness. Within this key relationship is the extent not only
    of language, but also of wisdom, and the secret to the undoing of
    transmigration itself. One of the many profound implications of this
    is that there is no such thing as a state of pure consciousness
    independent of concepts. \| *Ettāvatā
    vaṭṭaṁ vattati itthattaṁ
    paññāpanāya* should be read with such passages as [SN
    22.56:5.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.56/en/sujato#5.3): *ye
    kevalino vaṭṭaṁ tesaṁ natthi
    paññāpanāya* ("For consummate ones, there is no cycle
    of rebirths to be found"). \| The Mahāsaṅgīti reading
    *aññamaññapaccayatā pavattati* is spurious, since it
    inserts an Abhidhamma concept from the commentary.

[^208]: The text now turns to an analysis of theories of "self"
    (*attā*), which is comparable to some of the passages
    of [DN 1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato). The Buddha began
    his discourse by stating that it is the failure to understand
    dependent origination that keeps beings trapped in transmigration.
    Dependent origination explains transmigration in a purely empirical
    way by inferring from the mental and physical phenomena we
    experience here and now. Self theorists, on the other hand, explain
    transmigration by introducing a new metaphysical principle, the
    "self" or "soul", by which they assume that the individual has an
    eternal underlying essence.

[^209]: "Formed" is *rūpī* ("possessing form"), identifying
    the self with the first of the five aggregates. If something were
    really the core essence of a person, you would think it is readily
    knowable. But the Buddha shows that theorists describe the self in
    multiple different and incompatible ways. Each of these draws on
    some more-or-less arbitrary aspect of empirical reality, such as
    "form", to describe an unknowable metaphysical entity that is in
    fact just pure supposition.

[^210]: An example of a self that is "physical and limited" would be the
    body.

[^211]: Such as the cosmos.

[^212]: Perhaps this is the self of "limited perception" ([DN
    1:2.38.13](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#2.38.13)). This
    would be where the mind is aware of something limited, and the self
    is identified with the mental dimension of that awareness.

[^213]: Such as the formless dimensions.

[^214]: The three options ("it is", "it will be so", and "I will make it
    be so") illustrate how the theorist resorts to ever more convoluted
    means to justify the lack of empirical support for their pet theory.
    \| *Bhāviṁ* ("sure to become") is the root
    *bhū* with the primary affix *-ī*, which
    connotes an inevitable future state. \| *Tattha* ("in some other
    place", literally "there") is explained by the commentary as
    *paraloke* ("in the next world").

[^215]: Their surface differences rest on the same underlying
    assumption, so if the assumption is disproved there is no need to
    refute each individual theory. \| *Iccālaṁ* resolves to
    *iti alaṁ*.

[^216]: This is the Buddha, who does not theorize a metaphysical self.
    Implicit in this argument is Occam's razor, "entities must not be
    multiplied beyond necessity". Since the self theorists want to prove
    the existence of the "self", it is up to them to supply the grounds
    to support their suppositions. Since they fail to do so, the
    rational position is that there is no self. The Buddha is not under
    a similar obligation to prove the non-existence of the "self", since
    it is reasonable to assume that things do not exist until the
    evidence says otherwise.

[^217]: Having asserted a metaphysical "self", the theorists go on to
    make certain observations and interpretations regarding it.

[^218]: The Buddha moves from theories of the self as form to feeling,
    the second of the five aggregates.

[^219]: For example, identifying the self with the supposed eternal
    bliss of heaven. As with the description of self in physical terms,
    the theorist proceeds from a simple assertion of identity to more
    complicated hypotheses.

[^220]: This is the inverse of the previous. The self is still defined
    *in relation to* feeling, but it is a negative relation. Such
    theories are commonly found in the Upaniṣads, where a
    prominent thread of analysis systematically rejects all the things
    that are *not* the self (*neti*), before finally arriving at what
    *is* the self (eg. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad
    4.5.15).

[^221]: Here the theorist describes feeling as a function of the self:
    it is not what the self *is*, but what the self *does*. At [MN
    38:5.11](https://suttacentral.net/mn38/en/sujato#5.11) (= [MN
    2:8.8](https://suttacentral.net/mn2/en/sujato#8.8)),
    Sāti describes the self as consciousness, "the speaker
    and feeler who experiences the results of good and bad deeds in all
    the different realms".

[^222]: The Buddha goes on to develop specific arguments addressing each
    position.

[^223]: The Buddha points out the universal experience of feeling, thus
    establishing his argument on common ground. This same argument is
    found at [MN 74:10.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn74/en/sujato#10.1).

[^224]: The idea that only one kind of feeling can be experienced at a
    time became an adage of Buddhist psychology, but it is not obvious
    to me that it is the case. Here and at MN 74 it is assumed to be a
    shared belief with non-Buddhists.

[^225]: Feeling is part of the fundamental structure of consciousness.
    This argument comes through more clearly in Pali, for the word for
    "feeling" (*vedanā*) is derived from and still lies
    close to the sense of "knowing, experiencing". Thus the question is,
    "If there was no mind, would there be the thought 'I am this'?" The
    commentary explains that this refers to the bare material realm
    which is devoid of consciousness. The commentary appears to support
    the variant reading *ahamasmī* here. This makes sense
    in context, for "I am" is the first and most primordial assertion of
    a self, while "I am this" is a more sophisticated identification of
    the self in relation to the aggregates.

[^226]: The theorist avoids identifying feeling as the self, but they
    must identify *something* as the self (as for example,
    Sāti said the self was *viññāṇa*).
    Feeling, however, is deeply wound into the structure of
    consciousness, so if feeling were to be utterly absent, no other
    mental phenomena could continue, and there would therefore be no
    possibility of forming a theory of self.

[^227]: Letting go is not just a conceptual matter, it has immediate
    emotional consequences. *Paritassati* conveys the twin senses of
    desire and agitation, for which "anxiety" seems the best fit.

[^228]: This recalls the similar statement at [DN
    15:22.6](https://suttacentral.net/dn15/en/sujato#22.6). Whereas
    there it was a statement about name and form with consciousness,
    here it is a description of the arahant who has fully realized it.
    Unlike the theorists whose views do not withstand empirical
    scrutiny, the arahant's liberation is based on a direct
    understanding of reality.

[^229]: The Buddha returns once more to the question of rebirth,
    describing various states of rebirth in terms of consciousness. The
    seven planes are also mentioned at [DN
    33:2.3.28](https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#2.3.28), [DN
    34:1.8.11](https://suttacentral.net/dn34/en/sujato#1.8.11), and [AN
    7.44:1.1](https://suttacentral.net/an7.44/en/sujato#1.1).

[^230]: "Plane of consciousness" is *viññāṇaṭṭhiti*, which
    could also be rendered "station".

[^231]: In the first of these dimensions there is no consciousness at
    all, and in the second there is no consciousness in the normal
    sense, which is why they cannot be called "planes of consciousness".

[^232]: *Abhinandituṁ*, to "take pleasure in", to "relish",
    or to "delight in" appears in the standard formula for the second
    noble truth, where craving "takes pleasure in various realms"
    (*tatratatrābhinandinī*).

[^233]: One "freed by wisdom" has wisdom as the dominant faculty.

[^234]: The eight liberations (*vimokkhā*) are an
    alternative way of describing the meditative experiences of
    *jhāna*. Elsewhere they are listed at [DN
    16:3.33.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#3.33.1), [DN
    33:3.1.168](https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#3.1.168), [DN
    34:2.1.191](https://suttacentral.net/dn34/en/sujato#2.1.191),
    [AN:8.66](https://suttacentral.net/an/en/sujato#8.66), [MN
    77:22.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn77/en/sujato#22.1), and referred
    to at [AN 4.189:1.8](https://suttacentral.net/an4.189/en/sujato#1.8)
    and [Thag
    20.1:33.1](https://suttacentral.net/thag20.1/en/sujato#33.1). At [AN
    8.120](https://suttacentral.net/an8.120/en/sujato) and [MN
    137:27.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn137/en/sujato#27.1) they are
    listed but not called the eight liberations.

[^235]: Someone sees a meditative vision based on the perception of
    their own body, such as through mindfulness of breathing or one's
    own body parts. The first three liberations all cover the four
    *jhānas*.

[^236]: A meditator grounds their practice on some external focus, such
    as a light, the sight of a corpse, or an external element such as
    earth.

[^237]: This is a practice based on wholly pure and exalted meditation,
    such as the meditation on love, or the sight of a pure brilliant
    color like the sky.

[^238]: The "cessation of perception and feeling"
    (*saññāvedayitanirodha*) is a culminating meditation
    state of supreme subtlety that often leads directly to awakening
    (but see [AN 5.166](https://suttacentral.net/an5.166/en/sujato)).
    The state itself, like all meditation states, is temporary, but
    afterwards the defilements can be eliminated forever. This
    liberating insight is the consequence of the balanced development of
    all eight factors of the path.

[^239]: This passage emphasizes that this person is fully adept and has
    mastered all the states of meditation. The Buddha claimed such
    mastery ([AN
    9.41:16.1](https://suttacentral.net/an9.41/en/sujato#16.1)), and
    retained the ability even on his deathbed ([DN
    16:6.8.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#6.8.1)).

[^240]: Here we see the terms "one who is freed" used in two ways. All
    arahants have "freedom of heart" (by means of
    *samādhi*) and "freedom by wisdom" (the realization of
    the Dhamma). At the same time, one who emphasizes
    *samādhi* is said to have "freedom of heart" in
    contrast with one who emphasizes wisdom, who has "freedom by
    wisdom". One who has consummate mastery of both
    *samādhi* and wisdom is said to be "freed both ways".

[^241]: The longest of all early discourses, this dramatic and moving
    narrative tells the story of the Buddha's slow journey towards his
    final passing.

[^242]: After the events of [DN
    2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato), Ajātasattu
    retained and consolidated his power. Magadha ultimately conquered
    the Vajji Federation and continued to expand until almost all of
    India was under its sway.

[^243]: According to the commentary, Ajātasattu's anger was
    rooted in a dispute on trade routes. Control of shipping on the
    Ganges was essential for establishing international trade. There was
    a port on the Ganges extending over a league, split half and half
    between Magadha and Vajji. Valuable products were sourced from a
    mountain and brought down for trade, but the Vajjis kept absconding
    with the whole lot. The place is not identified, but Munger, a
    strategic port east of Patna, fits the description. The nearby hills
    have been mined since paleolithic times. It is also likely, as
    maintained in Jain tradition, that the Vajjis disputed
    Ajātasattu's accession after committing regicide. His
    threatening posture towards the Vajjis is also mentioned in [SN
    20.8:2.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn20.8/en/sujato#2.2).

[^244]: Vassakāra appears in the suttas as a devoted
    follower of the Buddha.

[^245]: The Vajji Federation harks back to an early settlement founded
    by the legendary Nābhānediṣṭha in the Vedic period. It
    built its wealth on its extensive fertile plains and the trading
    possibilities opened up by the Gandak and Ganges rivers.

[^246]: While it may seem strange to consult the Buddha on such a
    violent plan, Ajātasattu knows from his experience in
    DN 2 that the Buddha will not hesitate to tell him the truth, even
    if it is bad news. It seems he is trying to avoid the downfall of
    tyrants who are surrounded only with yes men.

[^247]: Reading *yojapetvā* ("had them harnessed"), which
    is found in the Mahāsaṅgīti in similar passages, and in
    this passage in the PTS edition.

[^248]: Ānanda cares for the Buddha in his old age. Shortly after these
    events, Ānanda was entrusted with reciting the suttas at the First
    Council. This discourse would have been composed by him in the years
    following his Master's death. More than a simple interlocutor,
    Ānanda shapes the story as its second lead, a relatable character
    with an empathetic point of view. He imbues the discourse with his
    emotional struggles as he deals with the Buddha's passing and helps
    ensure the future survival of the Dhamma, while still developing his
    own meditation practice.

[^249]: As for example at [AN
    8.12:1.2](https://suttacentral.net/an8.12/en/sujato#1.2).

[^250]: Harmony is especially important as the Vajji Federation was
    comprised of several different clans, among them the Licchavis of
    Vesālī, the Ñātikas just south of
    Vesālī, the Uggas of Hatthigāma (Elephant
    Village), and the Bhogas of Bhoganagara. Some sources say the Vajjis
    proper were another tribe within the alliance. The Videhans of
    Mithilā are also sometimes included, but several
    sources indicate that they remained an independent, if reduced,
    kingdom until they were conquered by Magadha some years later. The
    Mallas of Pāvā and Kusinārā formed a
    closely allied independent republic ([MN
    35:12.8](https://suttacentral.net/mn35/en/sujato#12.8)).

[^251]: The "ancient Vajjian traditions" (*porāṇe
    vajjidhamme*) would have been established with the founding of the
    Vajji Federation some centuries earlier, which ensured that the
    members of the federation would have a voice in the
    Licchavi-dominated union. Compare with the "ancient traditions of
    the brahmins" (*porāṇā brāhmaṇadhammā* at
    [AN 5.191](https://suttacentral.net/an5.191/en/sujato) and [Snp
    2.7](https://suttacentral.net/snp2.7/en/sujato)), the falling away
    from which is said to be the cause of Brahmanical decline.
    Similarly, the Buddha elsewhere scolds the Vajjis for their
    indulgence ([AN 5.143](https://suttacentral.net/an5.143/en/sujato)),
    suggesting that the decline may have already set in.

[^252]: This advocates for legal protection for women from sexual
    violence. \| For various legal regulations regarding women and sex,
    see Kauṭilya's Arthaśāstra 12.

[^253]: The Buddha will stay at several of these shrines later in this
    discourse. They were sacred groves, maintained by the people in
    reverence for the powerful spirits of nature. \| "Spirit-offerings"
    is *bali*. \| The commentary explains "inner or outer" as inside or
    outside the town.

[^254]: It is an old Indian belief that the presence of holy persons
    provides a kind of umbrella effect that protects the realm.

[^255]: This event is recorded at [AN
    7.21](https://suttacentral.net/an7.21/en/sujato), where the Buddha
    addresses the Licchavis. That chapter of the Aṅguttara
    mostly consists of the teachings found here presented as separate
    suttas. \| The Sārandada shrine was short walk from
    Vesālī ([AN
    5.143](https://suttacentral.net/an5.143/en/sujato)).

[^256]: There is a certain tension here: the Buddha taught these
    principles to the Vajjis, one of which is that the Vajjis should not
    adopt new decrees. It seems that a "decree"
    (*paññatta*) is more like constitutional law, whereas a
    "principle" (*dhamma*) is more like a behavioral guideline.

[^257]: *Upalāpana* is used a number of times in the
    Vinaya, where it always has the sense of giving someone something to
    get them to do what you want. It has the same sense at [SN
    3.25:4.13](https://suttacentral.net/sn3.25/en/sujato#4.13), where an
    enemy king may be bribed with gold from the royal treasury. \| The
    commentary says that Vassakāra himself was assigned
    with the task of weakening the Vajjis in this way.

[^258]: There were several monasteries and hermitages around
    Rājagaha ([Kd
    2:11.1.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/sujato#11.1.1)).

[^259]: Also at [AN 7.23](https://suttacentral.net/an7.23/en/sujato).

[^260]: This especially refers to the fortnightly *uposatha*. Despite
    the dangers faced in the rugged hills around Rājagaha
    ([Kd
    2:12.1.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/sujato#12.1.1)),
    the Buddha insisted that all monks of the locality attended the
    *uposatha* ([Kd
    2:5.3.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/sujato#5.3.1)).

[^261]: The Buddha encouraged the mendicants to recite the Dhamma in
    harmony ([MN
    103:3.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn103/en/sujato#3.2)), to resolve
    issues in harmony ([MN
    104:14.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn104/en/sujato#14.3)), and on
    the *uposatha* to recite and train in the *pātimokkha*
    in harmony ([Bu As
    7:4.11](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-as7/en/sujato#4.11)).

[^262]: Picking up from the similar injunction to the Vajjis, this kicks
    off a long narrative arc that binds together the Buddha's invitation
    to abolish the minor rules ([DN
    16:6.3.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#6.3.1)) with the
    bad monk Subhadda's seizing on the Buddha's death as an excuse to
    give up the rules, which was the direct motivation for the First
    Council ([DN
    16:6.20.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#6.20.3) = [Kd
    21:1.1.24](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd21/en/sujato#1.1.24)),
    at the end of which the Sangha agreed not to abolish any rules ([Kd
    21:1.9.20](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd21/en/sujato#1.9.20)),
    a decision that was affirmed a century later at the Second Council
    ([Kd 22](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd22/en/sujato)).

[^263]: The nature of seniority in the Saṅgha is often
    misunderstood. There is no "hierarchy" (literally "rule of priests")
    in the sense of power-based relationships: no monastic has the
    authority to command another monk or nun. Seniority is owed respect,
    not obedience.

[^264]: This stands in place of the injunction against sexual violence,
    both principles being concerned with the harmful effects of desire.

[^265]: This stands in place of the injunction to maintain the shrines,
    where mendicants would frequently stay.

[^266]: This stands in place of the injunction to look after arahants.

[^267]: Also at [AN 7.24](https://suttacentral.net/an7.24/en/sujato).

[^268]: "Work" is *kamma*, which especially means "building work". Of
    course it is essential to do work, but one should not get too caught
    up in it. The Buddha did not believe that working hard was ennobling
    in and of itself.

[^269]: "Corrupt wishes" (*pāpicchā*) is defined as when a
    faithless person wishes to be known as faithful, or person otherwise
    lacking good qualities wishes to be known as having them ([AN
    10.23:6.2](https://suttacentral.net/an10.23/en/sujato#6.2)).

[^270]: This item and the preceding two were the downfall of Devadatta
    ([Iti 89](https://suttacentral.net/iti89/en/sujato)).

[^271]: Also at [AN 7.25](https://suttacentral.net/an7.25/en/sujato).

[^272]: Also at [AN 7.26](https://suttacentral.net/an7.26/en/sujato).

[^273]: As at [AN 7.27](https://suttacentral.net/an7.27/en/sujato).
    These "perceptions" are all meditation practices which are described
    at [AN 10.60](https://suttacentral.net/an10.60/en/sujato).

[^274]: These six principles are found in several places, but they are
    not elsewhere called "principles that prevent decline"; for example
    at [AN 6.11](https://suttacentral.net/an6.11/en/sujato) they are
    called "warm-hearted qualities" (*dhammā
    sāraṇīyā*). At [AN
    6.22](https://suttacentral.net/an6.22/en/sujato), however, a
    different six qualities are called "principles that prevent
    decline": not relishing work, talk, sleep, and company, being easy
    to admonish, and having good friends.

[^275]: This is the right view of the noble eightfold path, in other
    words, the four noble truths.

[^276]: This epitome of the Dhamma is repeated eight times in this
    discourse, summarizing the teachings in the Gradual Training. It is
    not found in this exact form elsewhere.

[^277]: "Imbued" (*paribhāvita*) as a mother hen imbues her
    eggs with warmth by sitting on them ([AN
    7.71:2.2](https://suttacentral.net/an7.71/en/sujato#2.2)). See also
    [SN 55.21:2.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn55.21/en/sujato#2.3).

[^278]: Some editions add *diṭṭhāsava* ("defilement of
    views"), but since that appears to be a late interpolation I follow
    the Mahāsaṅgīti in omitting it.

[^279]: This is the same rest-house at which the Buddha sojourned on his
    way from Rājagaha to Nāḷandā in the
    Brahmajālasutta ([DN
    1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato)).

[^280]: This was apparently the last time that the Buddha met
    Sāriputta. This encounter is recorded in an independent
    sutta at [SN 47.12](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.12/en/sujato) and
    expanded into a long discourse at [DN
    28](https://suttacentral.net/dn28/en/sujato). The
    Saṁyutta follows this meeting with the record of
    Sāriputta's passing at [SN
    47.13](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.13/en/sujato), and then the
    lament for the absence of both Sāriputta and
    Moggallāna at [SN 47.14
    ](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.14 /en/sujato). For some reason
    these events were omitted from the present discourse, even though
    they fit well thematically.

[^281]: As at [DN
    14:1.37.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#1.37.4),
    inference (*anvaya*) is regarded as a valid form of knowledge. The
    Buddha himself is said to rely on inference using the same simile at
    [AN 10.95:10.4](https://suttacentral.net/an10.95/en/sujato#10.4).

[^282]: This is modern Patna. In this account we see how it was
    developed from the simple riverside village of
    Pāṭaligāma to the citadel of Pāṭaliputta.
    Ajātasattu ultimately moved the capital of Magadha from
    the defensively-postured Rājagaha surrounded by hills
    to this trading center on open waters. Under Ashoka it became one of
    the greatest cities of the ancient world. It was named after the
    *pāṭalī* tree (*Stereospermum chelonoides*), known as
    *patala* in Hindi.

[^283]: Also at [AN 5.213](https://suttacentral.net/an5.213/en/sujato),
    [Ud 8.6:4.1](https://suttacentral.net/ud8.6/en/sujato#4.1), [DN
    33:2.1.36](https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#2.1.36), and [Kd
    1:28.4.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#28.4.1).

[^284]: The Buddha begins with the things most obvious and pertinent to
    the audience.

[^285]: Bewildered by fear and regret.

[^286]: *Suññāgāra* normally means an "empty dwelling", but
    here the commentary describes it as a curtained-off cubicle.

[^287]: Vassakāra was no dawdler, as he preceded the Buddha
    to Pāṭaligāma. And not long after, he returned to
    Rājagaha to build more fortifications there ([MN
    108:6.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn108/en/sujato#6.2)). \| *Nagara*
    here means "citadel, fortress", not "city". It has the same sense as
    *pura*. The construction is defensive and may well have begun before
    Ajātasattu began thinking of invading.

[^288]: The relation between deities and building sites (*vatthu*)
    appears only in this passage in the early texts (repeated at [Ud
    8.6:15.2](https://suttacentral.net/ud8.6/en/sujato#15.2) and [Kd
    1:28.7.3](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#28.7.3)).
    Divination and geomancy (*vatthuvijjā*) for building
    sites is said to be a wrong livelihood at [DN
    1:1.21.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#1.21.2).

[^289]: From this point, later texts always refer to
    Pāṭaliputta, but the reason for the change of name from
    Pāṭaligāma is not explained in the commentary. *Putta*
    is a suffix indicating the people of a certain clan or place, so
    *pāṭaliputta* means "a person from Pāṭalī
    (village)" or as we might say, "Pāṭalian". As the city
    became well known and its identity as a village receded, it must
    have become known as the "city of the Pāṭaliputtas" and
    hence simply Pāṭaliputta. Compare the uses of
    *ñātika* below. \| The commentary explains that
    *puṭabhedanaṁ* refers to the "opening of packages",
    signifying that it was a center of trade. This usage is attested as
    late as the 13th century Jain Vividhatīrthakalpa of
    Jinaprabhasūri.

[^290]: Excavations reveal that Pāṭaliputta was constructed
    of wood, so the danger of fire was real. It is situated on a
    low-lying flood plain of the Ganges, so flooding would also have
    been an obvious danger. As for dissension (*mithubheda*),
    Vassakāra had indicated that this was a means of
    bringing down the Vajjis, so it would seem that kamma was lying in
    wait for them.

[^291]: This is the *anumodanā* recited for the meal
    offering. Other examples are found at [Snp
    3.7:34.3](https://suttacentral.net/snp3.7/en/sujato#34.3) = [MN
    92:25.6](https://suttacentral.net/mn92/en/sujato#25.6), [SN
    55.26:20.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn55.26/en/sujato#20.1), [Kd
    1:15.14.4](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#15.14.4),
    and [Kd
    1:1.5.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#1.5.1). \| It
    is worth noting that no early *anomodanā* uses the
    imperative verb form *-tu* signifying giving a blessing (eg.
    *bhavatu sabbamaṅgalaṁ*, "may all blessings be"). They
    strictly use the indicative *-ti* to teach cause and effect: if you
    do this, that happens.

[^292]: Buddhism promotes good neighborliness with all beings, seen and
    unseen. Making an offering to the local spirits helps create a
    positive and healthy sense of place.

[^293]: At [AN 4.67:8.3](https://suttacentral.net/an4.67/en/sujato#8.3)
    a similar sentiment is expressed for animals.

[^294]: The "ford" (*tittha*) is symbolic; those who forge a path to
    salvation are called *titthakara*, such as the six leading ascetics
    of [DN 2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato). Today there is a
    5.7 km bridge at this crossing, which is appropriately called the
    Mahatma Gandhi Setu.

[^295]: "Dinghy" translates *uḷumpa*.

[^296]: In this stock phrase, we sometimes find
    *paccuṭṭhāsi* ("landed") and sometimes
    *pāturahosi* ("reappeared").

[^297]: *Aṇṇavaṁ* cannot mean "sea" here, since it is to be
    crossed with a bridge.

[^298]: Koṭigāma lay a short distance from the Ganges. The
    Buddha's stay here must therefore have followed the events of [SN
    47.14](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.14/en/sujato) at
    Ukkacelā on the Vajjian bank of the Ganges, where he
    laments the passing of Sāriputta and
    Moggallāna. He would have heard of
    Sāriputta's passing before then, while on the road from
    Nāḷandā to Pāṭaligāma, even though that is
    implausibly said to have happened at Sāvatthī ([SN
    47.13](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.13/en/sujato)).

[^299]: Also at [SN 56.21](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.21/en/sujato).

[^300]: Ñātika (also spelled *nātika*, or
    *nādika*; Sanskrit *jñātṛka*;
    Prākrit *nāyika*) was the clan to which
    the Jain leader Mahāvīra (called
    Nāṭaputta, i.e. Ñātiputta) belonged. Here
    it is unusually spelled in plural, which means "the land of the
    Ñātika clan".

[^301]: Here Ñātika is in singular and appears to be the
    name of a town. Thus Ñātika is first of all a name of a
    clan, then the land they live in, then their chief town. \| Over a
    millennium previously, the Indus Valley Civilization had built
    cities of fired brick with standardized size and construction
    methods, but in the Buddha's day most buildings were wood. This is
    the only brick building mentioned in the suttas; brick construction
    is also discussed in the Vinaya.

[^302]: It is unprecedented to discuss the spiritual destinies of an
    entire town like this. Normally this question is only asked when
    specific individuals known to the Buddha have passed away. Likely
    the passage was created in the wake of the passing of
    Mahāvīra to show that even his own people were
    enthusiastic Buddhists. This portion of the text is also found at
    [SN 55.8](https://suttacentral.net/sn55.8/en/sujato).

[^303]: [SN 55.9](https://suttacentral.net/sn55.9/en/sujato) inserts
    another series on a monk, nun, layman, and laywoman all called
    Asoka.

[^304]: This portion of the text is at [SN
    55.10](https://suttacentral.net/sn55.10/en/sujato). I spell names
    consistently with there.

[^305]: The suttas consistently depict lay folk as attaining the third
    stage of awakening, non-return, but not the highest stage of
    arahantship, except in rare cases on the deathbed. The tradition
    extended this by saying that if a lay person becomes an arahant,
    they must ordain or die that day, but this is not supported in the
    early texts. The point is not whether you receive an ordination, but
    whether you let go of attachments.

[^306]: The commentary to the Saṁyutta attributes the large
    number of deaths to a recent plague (*ahivātaroga*,
    "viper's breath disease"). This deadly contagion was known to kill
    off entire families ([Kd
    1:50.1.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#50.1.1)).
    According to the commentaries, the same disease once afflicted
    Vesālī, prompting the teaching of the Ratanasutta ([Snp
    2.1](https://suttacentral.net/snp2.1/en/sujato), [Kp
    6](https://suttacentral.net/kp6/en/sujato)).

[^307]: Mirrors are for doing makeup ([DN
    1:1.16.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#1.16.2)) or
    admiring oneself ([MN
    77:33.18](https://suttacentral.net/mn77/en/sujato#33.18)), which a
    mendicant should not do ([Kd
    15:2.4.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/sujato#2.4.1)). In
    the Dhamma a mirror is for self-reflection ([MN
    61:8.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn61/en/sujato#8.2)), while the
    mind is purified like polishing a mirror ([AN
    3.70:13.4](https://suttacentral.net/an3.70/en/sujato#13.4)).

[^308]: The four principles that follow are elsewhere identified as four
    factors of stream-entry ([AN
    9.27](https://suttacentral.net/an9.27/en/sujato)). At [SN
    12.41](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.41/en/sujato), understanding of
    dependent origination is included.

[^309]: "Experiential" is *avecca*, literally "having undergone".
    "Experiential confidence" is the faith of a stream-enterer, who has
    seen for themselves.

[^310]: They have experiential confidence in the Buddha as a teacher
    because they have followed his path and realized the results that he
    speaks of.

[^311]: A stream-enterer has direct experience of the four noble truths,
    so they have confirmed that the teaching is indeed realizable in
    this very life.

[^312]: The suttas distinguish between two senses of
    Saṅgha. The "mendicant Saṅgha"
    (*bhikkhusaṅgha*) is the conventional community of
    monks and nuns. The "Saṅgha of disciples"
    (*sāvakasaṅgha*) is classified as fourfold according to
    the stages of awakening: stream-entry, once-return, non-return, and
    perfection. Each of these stages is further subdivided into those of
    the path who are practicing for realization and those of the fruit
    who have realized. These are referred to as "noble disciples", four
    of the path and four of the fruit, making eight individuals in
    total.

[^313]: This entails keeping the five precepts at a minimum.

[^314]: Ambapālī means "protector of mangoes". Here the
    text just says she had a "grove", but it is identified as a mango
    grove below ([DN
    16:2.14.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#2.14.1)).

[^315]: In some versions, the Buddha is said to have taught the monks
    mindfulness in anticipation of the arrival of the beautiful
    courtesan.

[^316]: In the Gradual Training the mendicant "establishes mindfulness"
    to begin meditation. Here this practice is expanded, and in [DN
    22](https://suttacentral.net/dn22/en/sujato) it is expanded even
    further.

[^317]: The locative idiom *kāye kāyānupassī*
    indicates that the meditator focuses on a particular aspect of body
    contemplation, such as observing the breath, awareness of the body
    parts, or reflection on the four elements. \| "Rid of desire and
    aversion for the world" refers to clearing the mind through the
    previous practice of sense restraint.

[^318]: *Dhammā* here refers to the "principles" of cause
    and effect and the four noble truths which are understood by
    reflecting on the psychology of meditation itself. In this context
    *dhammā* does not mean "mental objects" or "phenomena"
    or "mental qualities".

[^319]: A *gaṇikā* was a trained entertainer and escort
    whose company commanded a high fee ([Kd
    8:1.1.7](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/sujato#1.1.7)). It
    was a respected position, as we see the city guild of
    Rājagaha, with King Bimbisāra's blessing,
    appoint the young woman Sālavatī in a similar position
    ([Kd
    8:1.2.13](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/sujato#1.2.13)).

[^320]: The text spends more time on the Vajjis' appearance than on
    Ambapālī's. At [Thig
    15.1:12.1](https://suttacentral.net/thig15.1/en/sujato#12.1) the nun
    Isidāsī recalls how she used to do the makeup for her
    husband every day, like his own personal beautician.

[^321]: There are various reading for *paṭivaṭṭesi*. The
    commentary glosses with *pahari* ("struck, collided").

[^322]: The derogatory indeclinable vocative *je* is otherwise used of
    the "naughty maid" Kāḷī at [MN
    21:9.13](https://suttacentral.net/mn21/en/sujato#9.13). "Wench" is a
    term meant to insult on the basis of servitude or promiscuity, so it
    seems appropriate. The Licchavis are not distinguishing themselves
    here; given their youth, wealth, licentiousness, and evident
    familiarity with Ambapālī, it seems safe to conclude
    that they had been her clients.

[^323]: *Dassatha* is second future plural of *dadāti*. The
    Vinaya parallel at [Kd
    6:30.4.5](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/sujato#30.4.5) uses
    optative forms instead. \| "With provinces" is
    *sāhāraṁ* (literally "with food", commentary:
    *sajanapadaṁ*) refers to the holdings around the city
    that supplied food and other necessities.

[^324]: Despite the context, *ambakā* has no etymological
    relation to *amba* ("mango") but is a term for "woman, mother", used
    here as a play on words.

[^325]: This demonstrates that a woman of Ambapālī's
    profession could own land and control significant resources.

[^326]: An *ārāma* is a tended and pleasant ground, a
    "park". Here it has previously been referred to as "grove" (*vana*)
    and "mango grove". Usually in the suttas, however, it is a name for
    a place where monastics live. In English, monastics don't live in
    parks, they live in monasteries. So once a place has been dedicated
    for the Saṅgha, I translate *ārāma* as
    "monastery".

[^327]: Pali texts waver between *beluva* ("wood-apple") and
    *veḷuva* (from *veḷuvant*, "full of
    bamboo").

[^328]: The Buddha was travelling with a large retinue, which could
    become burdensome on a small village if they were to stay the three
    months of the rains residence. The texts note several monasteries
    and places to stay around Vesālī.

[^329]: Here *upaṭṭhāka* refers to the lay devotees. \|
    *Apaloketi* ("take leave") also has a literal sense of "glance
    back"; both senses are found in the sutta (see [DN
    16:4.1.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#4.1.2)).

[^330]: "Life force" is *jīvitasaṅkhāra* whereas below we
    find *āyusaṅkhāra* ([DN
    16:3.10.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#3.10.1)). They
    are evidently synonyms; [Ps
    1.6:4.3](https://suttacentral.net/ps1.6/en/sujato#4.3) refers to the
    three *jīvitasaṅkhāras* from [MN
    43:24.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn43/en/sujato#24.2), but there
    the text has *āyusaṅkhāra*. *Saṅkhāra*
    could be interpreted here either as "volition" ("will to live") or
    as "life force" (i.e. the vital energy that sustains life).
    Elsewhere, however, *āyusaṅkhāra* clearly means "life
    force" ([SN
    20.6:3.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn20.6/en/sujato#3.2), [MN
    43:23.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn43/en/sujato#23.1)).

[^331]: This is the first indication of Ānanda's fragile emotional state
    in the days to come. \| Read *diṭṭhā* (= Sanskrit
    *diṣṭyā*), "fantastic, how fortunate", per [DN
    26:21.9](https://suttacentral.net/dn26/en/sujato#21.9) and [Ja
    81:1.4](https://suttacentral.net/ja81/en/sujato#1.4).

[^332]: Previously the Buddha had spoken of "taking leave" of the
    Saṅgha, but here something more specific is meant.
    *Udāharati* is typically used when a
    previously-mentioned matter (often unpleasant) is "brought up", as
    at the monastic procedures for confession or invitation to admonish
    ([Kd
    1:16.2.5](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#16.2.5), [Kd
    1:2.1.9](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#2.1.9)).
    Ānanda is implying that there is some unfinished disciplinary
    business that needs attention. Despite the Buddha's response, he did
    in fact go on to make a number of statements and rulings.

[^333]: For forty-five years he had been teaching and supporting the
    community.

[^334]: A principle not followed by some contemporary Buddhist schools
    that harbor "secret teachings".

[^335]: "Closed fist of a teacher" is *ācariyamuṭṭhi*.

[^336]: *Pariharissāmi* needs careful parsing with regard
    to tenses. The general meaning is to "carry about" or "maintain,
    nurture". The Buddha elsewhere said that he "leads" the
    Saṅgha ([DN
    26:25.6](https://suttacentral.net/dn26/en/sujato#25.6):
    *pariharāmi*). When the Buddha was about to go on
    retreat, Moggallāna said that he and
    Sāriputta "shall lead" (*pariharissāmi*),
    to which the Buddha said they "should lead" ([MN
    67:13.7](https://suttacentral.net/mn67/en/sujato#13.7):
    *parihareyyaṁ*). Devadatta, on the other hand, ensured
    his downfall when he determined that he "shall lead" the
    Saṅgha, having taken over from the Buddha ([AN
    5.100:2.3](https://suttacentral.net/an5.100/en/sujato#2.3), [Kd
    1:2.1.23](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#2.1.23)).
    Thus the future tense indicates the determination to lead. But at
    this point, the Buddha's mind is already set on letting go. He is
    not saying that no-one should lead the Saṅgha, but that
    it is up to whoever leads it to address the issues.

[^337]: The reading and derivation of *veṭhamissakena* are
    unclear. As a form of violence we find *veṭhamissena*
    at [Thag 2.12:1.1](https://suttacentral.net/thag2.12/en/sujato#1.1),
    notably also in instrumental. *Veṭha* means "twist,
    strap, turban". *Missa* means "mixed" or "plaited" ([Bu Ss
    2:2.1.21](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2/en/sujato#2.1.21)).
    Thus it probably refers to a kind of strong twisted material used to
    tie or bind, i.e. rope.

[^338]: Compare Rig Veda 8.48.5: "As leather binds a chariot, soma knits
    my joints together." Bṛhadāraṇyaka
    Upaniṣad 4.3.35 compares the labored breathing of one
    near death with the creaking of a heavily-laden cart.

[^339]: The suttas say little about this signless (*animitta*)
    meditation. Its defining characteristic is that consciousness does
    not "follow after signs" (*nimittānusāri
    viññāṇaṁ*, eg. [AN
    6.13:5.3](https://suttacentral.net/an6.13/en/sujato#5.3)). This is
    explained in [MN
    138:10.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn138/en/sujato#10.2) as not
    being distracted or affected by the features of sense impressions,
    as the "signs" are created by greed, hate, and delusion ([MN
    43:37.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn43/en/sujato#37.1)). The mental
    unification (*ekattaṁ*) based on this practice is
    listed after the form (and formless) *jhānas*, so it is
    very advanced. It is nonetheless a conditioned state ([MN
    121:11.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn121/en/sujato#11.4)), so it is
    possible that a mendicant might fall from it and disrobe ([AN
    6.60:8.10](https://suttacentral.net/an6.60/en/sujato#8.10)). However
    it may also be used to describe the meditation of an arahant ([SN
    41.7:6.12](https://suttacentral.net/sn41.7/en/sujato#6.12)). It is
    clear from [MN
    121:10.5](https://suttacentral.net/mn121/en/sujato#10.5) that the
    six senses are still functioning, unlike in deep serenity
    meditations. It seems that in such a state, the Buddha was able to
    function normally while seeing through the pain in his body.

[^340]: This central theme of the Buddha's teaching---that each of us is
    responsible for our own salvation---becomes even more important as
    the Buddha's days grow short.

[^341]: Read *tama(t)agge* with *tama* as superlative, literally "at the
    peak of the best".

[^342]: This detail is often mentioned in texts of the
    Sarvāstivāda school, but rarely in Pali.

[^343]: Normally *kappa* as a period of time means "eon", but the late
    canonical texts Kathāvatthu ([Kv
    11.5](https://suttacentral.net/kv11.5)) and
    Milindapañha ([Mil
    5.1.10](https://suttacentral.net/mil5.1.10)) argue that it means the
    "lifespan", an interpretation followed by the commentaries. Support
    for this comes from [DN
    26:28.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn26/en/sujato#28.3), which says
    that "long life" for a mendicant is the four bases of psychic power
    which enable you to remain for the *kappa*. Here it is surely
    talking about a full lifespan. Underlying this is the idea that in
    different epochs the "proper lifespan" varies; in the Buddha's day
    it was one hundred years ([DN
    14:1.7.7](https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#1.7.7)). We can
    resolve the problem if we read *kappa* here, not as a period of
    time, but as "proper, fitting", i.e. the "proper" lifespan of a
    hundred years.

[^344]: Here Ānanda's mind is "as if" possessed (*yathā*),
    but in the Vinaya *yathā* is missing: he is possessed
    ([Kd
    1:1.10.17](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#1.10.17)).
    Remember, Ānanda is telling this story about himself.

[^345]: Māra is the Buddhist deity of death, sex, and
    delusion; his aim is to trap beings in transmigration. He appears in
    many guises, both real and metaphorical, throughout the canon, but
    this sequence is his only direct appearance in the
    Dīghanikāya. Here he feigns compassion, urging the
    Buddha to find his final peace; but he has an ulterior motive, for
    with the Buddha's passing Māra's job will be much
    easier.

[^346]: *Parinibbāna* means "extinguishment", as of a
    flame. Here it appears as both noun ("extinguishment") and verb
    ("become extinguished"). It is not a particularly difficult term to
    translate. Linguistically it has nothing to do with "attachment", so
    renderings such as "unbinding" are untenable. It should be
    translated rather than just keeping "Nibbāna", not
    least because English resists verbifying adopted words, resulting in
    such constructions as "enter Nibbāna", which reifies it
    in a way that the Pali does not.

[^347]: Māra is citing the Buddha's words for his own
    purpose. The Pali tradition does not say when this encounter took
    place, but the Sanskrit Sarvāstivāda
    Catuṣparisatsūtra places it shortly after the Buddha's
    awakening.

[^348]: This passage makes it clear that it was the Buddha's intention
    from the beginning to establish an order of nuns
    (*bhikkhunī*).

[^349]: This passage is the narrative inverse of the occasion when
    Brahmā begged the Buddha to teach ([SN
    6.1:5.5](https://suttacentral.net/sn6.1/en/sujato#5.5), etc.).
    Throughout, the sutta artfully preserves a degree of narrative
    ambiguity. Here it almost appears as if the Buddha assents to
    passing away because of Māra's request, although his
    intent was clear earlier. Māra's reasoning, moreover,
    is based on the Buddha's own words.

[^350]: It seems that at this point, the Buddha is still spending the
    rains in Beluva village, from where he would sometimes go to nearby
    Vesālī for alms, or to a local shrine for meditation.
    He left Vesālī only after holding a meeting for all the
    Saṅgha, which probably signified the completion of the
    rains ([DN
    16:4.1.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#4.1.2)). If this
    reasoning is correct---and the text is not explicit---then he made
    this statement during the rains retreat. If, however, this reasoning
    is incorrect and we are already after the rains, it could not have
    been long after. Thus it is probably September/October, meaning that
    the final extinguishment was to take place in December/January. This
    conflicts with the tradition of ascribing his final extinguishment
    to the full moon of Vesak, in May.

[^351]: The Cāpāla shrine is unknown outside of this
    context. The Udāna commentary says that it was named
    after the *yakkha* who formerly lived there. Now,
    *cāpalla* means "fickleness, propensity to tremble" and
    is from the same root as earth-"quake" (*bhumicāla*;
    *capala* = *pacala* via metathesis). It is no great leap to
    *cāpāla*. If this is correct, it suggests that the
    shrine was dedicated to an earth spirit who commanded earthquakes; a
    fitting setting for the events to follow.

[^352]: Northern India lies in the shadow of the seismically active
    Alpide Belt, so the occurrence of earthquakes is realistic even if
    the causes are not scientific.

[^353]: For this difficult verse, I generally follow Bhikkhu Bodhi's
    long discussion in *Connected Discourses of the Buddha*, note 255 on
    the Mahāvagga. \| *Sambhava* means "production,
    creation", and here I think it refers to the prolonging of life
    which the Buddha had just rejected.

[^354]: *Bhavasaṅkhāra* ("life force") here is equivalent
    to *āyusaṅkhāra* and *jīvitasaṅkhāra*.

[^355]: *Attasambhava* ("self-creation") refers back to *sambhava* in
    the first line.

[^356]: So far as it goes, this is a naturalistic explanation. The
    "water element" has the quality of softening, while the "air
    element" is traditionally understood as "movement". Thus in modern
    terms this means, "When underground forces disturb a region of
    instability."

[^357]: The might of ascetics was legendary in ancient India (eg. [MN
    56:14.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn56/en/sujato#14.2)). The
    meditation described here might be compared with the "dimensions of
    mastery" below ([DN
    16:3.25.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#3.25.1)).

[^358]: At [DN
    14:1.17.7](https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#1.17.7) and [MN
    123:7.6](https://suttacentral.net/mn123/en/sujato#7.6) it is,
    rather, the entire galaxy that trembles, perhaps indicating that the
    enhanced miracle is a later development.

[^359]: There are many accounts of the Buddha's awakening in the suttas,
    but none, so far as I know, that mention an earthquake.

[^360]: See [SN
    56.11:13.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11/en/sujato#13.2).

[^361]: This refers to the Buddha's death. The Pali here uses both
    *nibbāna* and *parinibbāna*. Sometimes it
    is said that *nibbāna* is the attainment of
    arahantship, while *parinibbāna* is the death of an
    arahant, but this distinction is not consistently applied in the
    suttas. \| Regarding *nibbānadhātuyā* ("the element of
    extinguishment"), in Pali the case is ambiguous. It is sometimes
    translated "by means of" or "through", which assumes the
    instrumental; but the Sanskrit is *nirvāṇadhātau*,
    which must be locative.

[^362]: As at [AN 8.69](https://suttacentral.net/an8.69/en/sujato). The
    following series of "eight things" seems arbitrarily inserted here
    and breaks the flow of the narrative. They are absent from the
    Sanskrit Sarvāstivāda text edited by Waldschmidt, which
    goes directly to the conversation where Ānanda realizes that the
    Buddha is going to die.

[^363]: These "assemblies" were formal deliberative meetings, not just
    gatherings. Thus "householders" here does not mean "lay folk" in
    apposition to "ascetics"; rather it means "home owners". Some of
    these assemblies are depicted or alluded to in the
    Dīghanikāya. At [DN
    6:1.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn6/en/sujato#1.3), brahmins
    assemble in Vesālī; while at [DN
    3:1.13.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato#1.13.3),
    Ambaṭṭha speaks of an assembly of Sakyans, who were
    aristocrats. At [DN
    18:12.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn18/en/sujato#12.1), we get a
    glimpse of the proceedings at a meeting of the gods of the
    thirty-three.

[^364]: There do not appear to be any records of this happening in the
    early texts, although that is perhaps to be expected. It does feel
    out of character for the Buddha, as normally he is very up front.
    The commentary says that this ruse was adopted so the Buddha could
    plant subtle seeds (*vāsanā*) for the future.

[^365]: These are another way of describing the different experiences of
    *jhāna*. Also at [AN
    8.65](https://suttacentral.net/an8.65/en/sujato), [AN
    10.29:6.1](https://suttacentral.net/an10.29/en/sujato#6.1), [DN
    33:3.1.142](https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#3.1.142), [DN
    34:2.1.160](https://suttacentral.net/dn34/en/sujato#2.1.160), and
    [MN 77:23.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn77/en/sujato#23.1).

[^366]: "Perceiving form (*rūpa*) internally" refers to
    someone developing meditation based on an aspect of their own body,
    such as the breath or the parts of the body. The "forms"
    (*rūpā*) seen externally are the lights or other
    meditation phenomena that today are usually called *nimitta*. An
    "ugly" form is the mental image that arises in such contemplations
    as the parts of the body. A "beautiful" image arises from practices
    such as mindfulness of breathing.

[^367]: "Not perceiving form internally" refers to meditations such as
    the external elements, or the decaying of another's body.

[^368]: This is the meditation where one contemplates an external color,
    either a prepared disk or a natural phenomena such as the sky or a
    flower, which eventually gives rise to a "counterpart" image. Today
    such meditations are called *kasiṇa* following the
    Visuddhimagga, but in the early texts *kasiṇa* means
    "totality" and refers rather to the state of *samādhi*
    that results.

[^369]: Already encountered at [DN
    15:35.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn15/en/sujato#35.1).

[^370]: Note that this is the idiom that Ānanda uses when directly
    quoting the Buddha.

[^371]: "Misdeed" is *dukkaṭaṁ*. This term is familiar as
    the most minor class of offences in the Vinaya. Here we see an
    informal use of the term as something that has been wrongly done,
    rather than a legal violation. It is used in a similar way by
    Mākassapa at the First Council, who accuses Ānanda of
    several misdeeds. As a legal term, *dukkaṭa* is late;
    the category of offences is not found in the Vinayas of the
    Mahāsaṅghika group of schools, which use
    *vinayatikkrama* for a similar idea.

[^372]: The Buddha goes on to list multiple places where he hinted to
    Ānanda, but the only record of such a conversation is at the
    Cāpāla Shrine.

[^373]: The following group of places are all near
    Rājagaha, and collectively illustrate the variety of
    dwellings and environs enjoyed by the mendicants practicing there.
    \| The Gotama banyan tree shrine is mentioned only here. Gotama is a
    common name, and this shrine does not appear to have any connection
    with the Buddha.

[^374]: A cliff from which bandits were tossed as a means of execution.

[^375]: The Pali tradition says the First Council was held near the
    entrance to this cave (Dīpavaṁsa 4.19,
    Mahāvaṁsa 3.19, Samantapāsādikā
    Paṭhamamahāsaṅgītikathā). The Vinayas all agree that it
    was at Rājagaha, but traditions vary as to the exact
    location.

[^376]: A large open area where Jains did their penances ([MN
    14:15.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn14/en/sujato#15.2)) and the
    Buddha taught occasionally ([SN
    8.10](https://suttacentral.net/sn8.10/en/sujato)), but it is most
    famous as the place the monks Godhika ([SN
    4.23](https://suttacentral.net/sn4.23/en/sujato)) and Vakkali took
    their lives ([SN
    22.87](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.87/en/sujato)).

[^377]: Mentioned several times in the suttas as a pleasant place to
    meditate, it is notable as the site of the conversion of the
    Buddha's chief layman disciple Anāthapiṇḍika ([SN
    10.8](https://suttacentral.net/sn10.8/en/sujato)). But the most
    famous event there was when the Buddha moderated the monk
    Soṇa's excessive striving ([AN
    6.55](https://suttacentral.net/an6.55/en/sujato)).

[^378]: The hot springs near Rājagaha were a popular place
    for monks to bathe, so much so that they prompted a rule ensuring
    that the monks did not monopolize the springs ([Bu Pc
    57](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57/en/sujato)). They are
    still in use and just as popular as ever.

[^379]: A personal gift of King Bimbisāra, this was the
    first permanent monastery offered to the Buddha and his
    Saṅgha ([Kd
    1:22.17.3](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#22.17.3)).

[^380]: Mahākappina stayed here ([Kd
    1:5.3.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#5.3.1)), and
    the Buddha rested there when his foot was first injured, apparently
    by Devadatta, before Jīvaka offered his mango grove
    ([SN 1.38](https://suttacentral.net/sn1.38/en/sujato), [SN
    4.13](https://suttacentral.net/sn4.13/en/sujato)).

[^381]: The following group of places are all in the Vajjian country
    near Vesālī. Whereas the varied sites around
    Rājagaha reflect the rugged terrain there, at
    Vesālī all the sites are tree-shrines, as the
    surrounding land is flat. [DN
    24:1.11.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn24/en/sujato#1.11.5) indicates
    where they lay relative to Vesālī; the Udena shrine was
    to the east, and the next three to the south, west, and north
    respectively. \| *Udena* is an epithet of the "arising" sun (Rig
    Veda 1.48.7), although here it may have the sense "prosperity".

[^382]: Named after the local *yakkha*, to whom offerings would have
    been made. It could get cold enough to snow, prompting the Buddha to
    lay down a rule permitting three robes ([Kd
    1:13.2.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#13.2.1)). A
    short but galaxy-shaking discourse was once taught there ([AN
    3.125:0.3](https://suttacentral.net/an3.125/en/sujato#0.3)).

[^383]: The Pali has *amba* ("mango") and *ambaka* ("maiden") as
    variants. The commentary supports the latter, saying it was named
    for seven legendary princesses of Varanasi in the time of Buddha
    Kassapa, all of whom went on to become great disciples of our
    Buddha. I made this translation on the small island of Qimei off the
    south coast of Taiwan, where there is a shrine to the "seven
    maidens" who gave the island its name. Stories of "seven maidens"
    are widespread in myth and folklore all over the world, including
    Aboriginal Dreamtime stories. The archetype descends from the
    constellation known in English as Pleiades and in Sanskrit as
    Kṛttikā. Since there are six main visible stars in the
    cluster today, the stories often tell of how the youngest of the
    seven sisters was lost. In the Buddhist telling this is
    Visākhā, the only sister not to become an arahant in
    this life.

[^384]: This was, obviously, a fertility shrine.

[^385]: Previously mentioned as the place where the seven principles of
    non-decline were taught to the Licchavis. The meaning of
    Sārandada is obscure and variants profligate, but it
    might be derived from the Munda word *sara*, "funeral pyre". The
    commentary says it was taken over from an old shrine to a *yakkha*
    of that name.

[^386]: "Take back" is *paccāvamissati*, which has several
    variants. It occurs in [Ja
    69](https://suttacentral.net/ja69/en/sujato) and [Ja
    509](https://suttacentral.net/ja509/en/sujato), where it is the
    opposite of *vamati*, to "expel, vomit".

[^387]: This was the major Saṅgha residence near
    Vesālī. The Great Wood, according to the commentary,
    stretched as far as the Himalayas. Later tradition says that a town
    should have three woods: a "great wood" for wilderness
    (*mahāvana*); a "prosperity wood" for resources
    (*sirivana*); and an "ascetic wood" for spiritual practice
    (*tapovana*).

[^388]: Compare the earlier request to gather all the mendicants around
    Rājagaha ([DN
    16:1.6.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#1.6.2)).

[^389]: Memorization was considered an essential basis for learning. In
    similar passages, we also find the injunction to "recite" the
    teachings, thus authorizing the recitation of the Buddha's teachings
    after his death, which was later formalized in the Councils
    (*saṅgīti*).

[^390]: These are the sets of practices later called the 37
    *bodhiyapakkhiyā dhammā*, the "wings to
    awakening". Here they are presented as an essential summary of the
    Buddha's teachings. They form the backbone of the final book of the
    Saṁyuttanikāya, the Maggavagga (or
    Mahāvagga). It is likely that the Buddha was referring
    to the earliest recension of this text. They are found as a summary
    of the Buddha's teachings at [DN
    29:17.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato#17.3), [MN
    103:3.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn103/en/sujato#3.2), [MN
    104:5.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn104/en/sujato#5.3), and [AN
    8.19:17.2](https://suttacentral.net/an8.19/en/sujato#17.2) = [Ud
    5.5:25.2](https://suttacentral.net/ud5.5/en/sujato#25.2).

[^391]: This is perhaps the briefest summary possible of the Buddha's
    teaching. The world as it is, and all the beings in it, are created
    and sustained through conditions. Since the conditions that sustain
    them are finite, the conditioned phenomena are also finite and must
    come to an end. Reflecting on this gives rise to gratitude for the
    life we have and the opportunities it grants us, and determination
    to live and practice dedicated to the realization of the
    unconditioned, Nibbana.

[^392]: "Ripe old age" is *paripakko vayo*.

[^393]: "Well-settled thoughts" is *susamāhitasaṅkappā*.
    Compare *asamāhitasaṅkappo* at [AN
    4.22:5.3](https://suttacentral.net/an4.22/en/sujato#5.3).

[^394]: *Nāgāpalokitaṁ* is the "elephant look". There is a
    similar Sanskrit term *siṁhāvalokana*, the "lion look",
    said to be the slow glance back that a lion makes as he leaves his
    kill. There is a nuance in meaning here, because while *apalokana*
    literally means to "look back", it is used in the sense to "take
    leave" before setting out on a journey.

[^395]: *Bhaṇḍagāma*, where *bhaṇḍa* means
    "wares"; it must have been a trading post. It seems the villages in
    this passage were named after their chief economic activity, so I
    translate them to highlight this pragmatic system.

[^396]: This four also found at [AN
    4.1:2.3](https://suttacentral.net/an4.1/en/sujato#2.3) and [AN
    7.66:14.4](https://suttacentral.net/an7.66/en/sujato#14.4).

[^397]: Here the text refers to the Buddha in the third person; compare
    the previous set of verses in first person. Although the text states
    that these verses were spoken by the Buddha, it is possible that, as
    with many similar cases especially in the
    Aṅguttaranikāya, the verses were added by redactors.

[^398]: Note the use of "quenched" (*parinibbuto*) here while the Buddha
    is still alive.

[^399]: *Hatthigāma*, probably a village which specialized
    in training elephants.

[^400]: *Ambagāma*.

[^401]: *Jambugāma*.

[^402]: Departing from the economic naming scheme, here *bhoga* does not
    mean "wealth". Rather, the Bhogas were one of the clans of the Vajji
    Federation.

[^403]: "Great references" is *mahāpadesa*; also at [AN
    4.180](https://suttacentral.net/an4.180/en/sujato). A different set
    of four *mahāpadesas* are [Kd
    1:40.1.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#40.1.1),
    which provide criteria by which mendicants may judge what is and is
    not allowable.

[^404]: The phrase used in the suttas when reporting a teaching heard
    directly from the Buddha, eg. [SN
    55.52:5.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn55.52/en/sujato#5.1), [SN
    22.90:9.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.90/en/sujato#9.1), [MN
    47:10.7](https://suttacentral.net/mn47/en/sujato#10.7), etc.

[^405]: *Dhamma*, *vinaya*, and *satthusāsana* are used in
    the suttas in the general sense of the entirety of the Buddha's
    teachings. In his advice to Mahāpajāpatī ([AN
    8.53](https://suttacentral.net/an8.53/en/sujato)) and
    Upāli ([AN
    7.83](https://suttacentral.net/an7.83/en/sujato)), they are said to
    be whatever conforms with letting go. A stream-enterer who is a lay
    person is grounded in them ([AN
    6.16:7.2](https://suttacentral.net/an6.16/en/sujato#7.2)). They are
    more frequent in the Vinaya, being used as a general qualifier of a
    legitimate legal procedure ([Bu Pc
    63:2.1.8](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc63/en/sujato#2.1.8)).
    Due to this, the fact that there are three items, and the fact that
    *dhamma* and *sutta* are different words, we should not take
    *dhamma* and *vinaya* here as equivalent to *sutta* and *vinaya*
    below. Rather, they are a general claim to authenticity and do not
    specify particular texts.

[^406]: As at [MN
    112:3.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn112/en/sujato#3.1), [DN
    29:18.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato#18.4), and [AN
    4.180:2.5](https://suttacentral.net/an4.180/en/sujato#2.5).

[^407]: It is tempting to assume that *sutta* here means the
    Suttapiṭaka and *vinaya* means the
    Vinayapiṭaka, or at least an earlier version of these
    texts; but this is not supported by tradition. The late canonical
    Netti explains *sutta* as "the four noble truths" and *vinaya* as
    "the removal of greed, hate, and delusion" ([Ne
    6](https://suttacentral.net/ne6/en/sujato)). The commentaries
    discuss many interpretations; ultimately they agree with the Netti
    for *vinaya*, but say *sutta* means the entire
    Tipiṭaka. I think the Netti is correct: teachings
    should "fit in" with the four noble truths (like other footprints
    fit in to an elephant's footprint, [MN
    28](https://suttacentral.net/mn28/en/sujato)), and they should "be
    exhibited" in that the results of practice should be apparent
    (*sandiṭṭhika*). \| "Memorize"
    (*uggahetvā*), because in an oral tradition a text is
    not learned until it is known by heart; such claims must be taken
    seriously. \| "Fit into" is *osāreti* or
    *otāreti* per [AN
    4.180](https://suttacentral.net/an4.180/en/sujato); the two words
    have a similar meaning, "to flow down into".

[^408]: The text has *ca* ("and") rather than *vā* ("or"),
    which would be expected if they were to be found in one or other
    textual collection. This is urging that any teaching fits in with
    the fundamental principles of the four noble truths, and is
    effective in removing defilements.

[^409]: The Pali text appears to say that one should remember the
    *mahāpadesa*, whereas the Sanskrit clearly says one
    should remember the passage (*ayaṁ
    dharmo'yaṁ vinaya idaṁ śāstuḥ
    śāsanam iti viditvā
    dhārayitavyāḥ*). It seems as if this pattern should
    underlie the Pali too, for if the passage is false, one "should
    reject it" (*chaḍḍeyyātha*). In the case of a correct
    passage we should expect a parallel injunction that one "should
    remember it" (*dhāreyyātha*). But if this applies to
    the *mahāpadesa* there is no such injunction. Thus it
    seems as if the Sanskrit is correct here and the Pali corrupt. I
    restore it by reversing the order of the phrases.

[^410]: Each of the four references is a little less solid than the
    previous. Here one hasn't heard from the Buddha, but from the
    Saṅgha. The fact that one hears it from the
    Saṅgha implies a kind of formal group recitation such
    as a *saṅgīti* or "council".

[^411]: Now one learns not from a unified Saṅgha, but from
    several learned elders. This is a stock description of learned
    mendicants (eg. [AN
    3.20:6.2](https://suttacentral.net/an3.20/en/sujato#6.2)). \|
    "Inheritors of the heritage" is *āgatāgamā*, where
    *āgama* means "what has come down", namely the
    scriptural heritage. *Āgama* is a synonym for *nikāya*
    in the sense of "collection of scripture". \| The "outlines"
    (*mātikā*, literally "matrix") are the summary outlines
    of topics that served as seeds for the development of Abhidhamma.
    [DN 16:3.50.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#3.50.5)
    features one of the earliest of such lists, the 37 path factors that
    the Buddha "taught from his own direct knowledge". These serve as
    outline for the section on the path in the Saṁyutta,
    from where they were adopted in various Abhidhamma texts such as the
    Vibhaṅga.

[^412]: Finally the testimony of a single mendicant, which is the
    weakest of all. Nonetheless, the procedure is the same.

[^413]: The parallel at [AN
    4.180:9.11](https://suttacentral.net/an4.180/en/sujato#9.11) omits
    *dhāreyyāthā*, which I take to be the correct reading.
    See my note on *dhāreyyāthā* at [DN
    16:4.8.13](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#4.8.13).

[^414]: Pāvā, a town of the Mallas, has more significance
    for this narrative than appears at first sight. It was, according to
    Buddhist texts, the place where Mahāvīra had recently
    died, plunging the Jains into chaos. (The Jains, however, say this
    was another Pāvā, east of Nāḷandā.)
    Pāvā became associated with especially ascetic monks:
    thirty Pāvā monks became awakened on hearing a
    particularly strong discourse ([SN
    15.13](https://suttacentral.net/sn15.13/en/sujato));
    Mahākassapa heard the news of the Buddha's passing at
    Pāvā; and monks from Pāvā allied with
    monks of "Avanti and the south" arguing for strict Vinaya in the
    Second Council ([Kd
    1:1.7.11](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#1.7.11)).

[^415]: This passage also at [Ud
    8.5](https://suttacentral.net/ud8.5/en/sujato).

[^416]: Cunda was apparently a metal-worker, which was an advanced form
    of technological craftsmanship.

[^417]: This is, according to the commentary, preserved as the other
    discourse taught to Cunda, which deals with proper asceticism ([Snp
    1.5](https://suttacentral.net/snp1.5/en/sujato)).

[^418]: The exact meaning of *sūkaramaddava* is unclear.
    *Sūkara* is "pig", but some Chinese translations
    suggest the sense "mushroom"; and it is true that there are several
    names of plants or plant dishes that begin with
    *sūkara* or other animals. At [Dhp
    377](https://suttacentral.net/dhp377/en/sujato), flowers are
    described as *maddava*, meaning "overripe, withering on the vine".
    It is a common practice to allow meat to sit for a while to become
    tender and "high" for extra flavor when cooked. But this can lead to
    a proliferation of dangerous bacteria unless properly cooked, and
    such seems to have been the case here. In any case, this disputed
    term is marginal in a consideration of meat-eating in early
    Buddhism, which is discussed more fully elsewhere.

[^419]: If the Buddha knew the meal was dangerous, why ask to be served
    it? This is even more striking in light of the fact that it is a
    Vinaya offence to request fine food, including meat, and nowhere
    else is such a request recorded ([Bu Pc
    39:2.10.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39/en/sujato#2.10.1)).
    Such narrative ambiguities serve to escalate a sense of wonder.

[^420]: The Buddha's illness is sometimes diagnosed as mesenteric
    infarction. The Buddha's body rejects the world of conditioned
    existence entirely.

[^421]: The commentary says that these verses were added by the elders
    at the Council.

[^422]: The *saṅghāṭi* ("outer robe" or "cloak") is
    double-layered, and served both for warmth and as bedding. The
    Buddha has not recovered fully from his illness.

[^423]: The Buddha was an exemplary patient. He did not complain, but
    made his needs known clearly to his carer.

[^424]: It would seem that, since the Buddha was enduring his illness
    without complaint and with dignity, Ānanda did not fully realize how
    weak he has become.

[^425]: The bowl (*patta*) was used both for eating and drinking.

[^426]: Pukkusa is not elsewhere mentioned. The reference to
    Āḷāra Kālāma recalls the narrative of the
    bodhisatta's practices before awakening. There are several details
    that indicate the stories of the first part and the last part of the
    Buddha's life were unified by such callbacks. We meet the Malla clan
    later on.

[^427]: *Niśraya* in the sense of "near" occurs at
    Śatapathabrāhmaṇa 3.1.2.17.

[^428]: In deep meditation the senses cease to function.

[^429]: As were Mahāpajāpatī's limbs ([AN
    8.51](https://suttacentral.net/an8.51/en/sujato)).

[^430]: A nearby town where the Buddha had stayed previously ([Kd
    1:37.4.2](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#37.4.2)).

[^431]: *Siṅgīvaṇṇa*, or else *siṅgīsuvaṇṇa*
    ([AN 3.70:38.3](https://suttacentral.net/an3.70/en/sujato#38.3)), is
    gold from a mountain peak (*siṅgī*).
    Kauṭilya mentions a form of gold that is
    *śṛṅgaśūktija*, "occurring on mount Śūkti"
    (Arthaśāstra 2.13.3). The commentary to that passage
    says it had the color of red arsenic, so it would have been a rose
    gold color.

[^432]: Closing the narrative circle with the story of awakening.

[^433]: The commentary says this verse was added by the senior monks at
    the Council.

[^434]: The monk Cundaka makes an abrupt appearance here; this is the
    only mention of this name. The commentary to this passage calls him
    *cunda*, while the gloss to the parallel passage at [Ud
    8.5:14.3](https://suttacentral.net/ud8.5/en/sujato#14.3) has
    *cundaka* throughout. The diminutive ending *-ka* is perhaps meant
    to differentiate him from the smith Cunda. There are various Cundas
    whose connection is unclear. Mahācunda was one of the
    great disciples ([MN
    118:](https://suttacentral.net/mn118/en/sujato), [AN
    6.17](https://suttacentral.net/an6.17/en/sujato), [MN
    8](https://suttacentral.net/mn8/en/sujato)), who later brought the
    Dhamma to the land of the Cetīs ([AN
    6.46](https://suttacentral.net/an6.46/en/sujato), [AN
    10.24](https://suttacentral.net/an10.24/en/sujato)). He once stayed
    with Channa and Sāriputta ([MN
    144:4.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn144/en/sujato#4.1), [SN
    35.87:1.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.87/en/sujato#1.2)); the
    commentaries say he was in fact Sāriputta's younger
    brother. They also identify him with the "novice Cunda" who reported
    the deaths of Sāriputta ([SN
    47.13:1.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.13/en/sujato#1.3)) and
    Mahāvīra ([DN
    29:2.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato#2.1), [MN
    104:3.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn104/en/sujato#3.1)), explaining
    that the title "novice" was a nickname that persisted from the time
    he ordained as a young novice. It is unclear whether the
    commentaries take the Cundaka of this passage to be the same person,
    but he is here performing a similar role as carer adjacent to the
    Buddha's death. Later there appears a Cūḷacunda ([Tha
    Ap 52:13.3](https://suttacentral.net/tha-ap52/en/sujato#13.3)). Thus
    there may have been one person known by different names, or several
    people whose stories have become conflated.

[^435]: These verses were also added at the Council according to the
    commentary.

[^436]: Adopt PTS and BJT reading *satthā
    pavattā*.

[^437]: The text addresses Cunda with the respectful
    *āvuso*.

[^438]: Again, the narrative circle.

[^439]: The text uses *āyasmā* here for Cunda, as does the
    Sanskrit, whereas it is normally reserved for mendicants (see below,
    [DN 16:6.2.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#6.2.1)).

[^440]: This became a point of discussion in later Buddhism: can it be
    that the merit of a gift grows after it is given?

[^441]: Known today as Kushinagar, it is a popular site for pilgrims,
    with many ancient stupas, Buddha images, and a peaceful park for
    meditation.

[^442]: Normally when the Buddha lies down, his mind is focused on
    getting up. But now he knows that he will not rise again.

[^443]: Sal trees blossom in April/May. This detail agrees with the
    Buddha's final extinguishment in December/January, rather than in
    May (Vesak) as is currently celebrated (see note to [DN
    16:3.9.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#3.9.3)).

[^444]: This calls back to the description of the fourfold assembly in
    the Māra section above ([DN
    16:3.7.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#3.7.4)).

[^445]: This kind of narrative elevation is characteristic of the
    Buddha's teaching. He did not try to deny or eliminate any belief in
    the miraculous, or in the power of devotion, but rather to show that
    such things were of limited worth compared with practice.

[^446]: Like Cundaka above, Upavāna shares the duties of an
    attendant with Ānanda; at [DN
    29:41.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato#41.1) he is also
    fanning the Buddha. At [AN
    5.166](https://suttacentral.net/an5.166/en/sujato), Ānanda goes to
    Upavāna for support when he feels he has disappointed
    the Buddha.

[^447]: In [SN 7.13](https://suttacentral.net/sn7.13/en/sujato)
    Upavāna fetched hot water and molasses for the Buddha,
    an event he remembered in his own verses at [Thag
    2.33](https://suttacentral.net/thag2.33/en/sujato).

[^448]: For this usage of *phuṭo*, see [AN
    3.56:1.3](https://suttacentral.net/an3.56/en/sujato#1.3).

[^449]: Elsewhere, *pathavīsaññī* refers to those who
    develop a form of meditation where they are "percipient of earth"
    ([AN 10.6:1.2](https://suttacentral.net/an10.6/en/sujato#1.2)).
    Here, however, it simply means those deities who are aware of events
    on the ground. \| Read *chinnaṁpādaṁ viya papatanti*.

[^450]: The Buddha as "eye" evokes the common (eg. Rig Veda 1.164.14,
    5.40.8, 5.59.5, 10.10.9) Vedic image of the Sun as the "eye of all"
    (*viśvacakṣāḥ*, 7.63.1), the "eye" for "eyes to see"
    (10.158.4), moving as an unaging wheel through the sky (1.164.14).
    See [Snp 3.9:11.1](https://suttacentral.net/snp3.9/en/sujato#11.1) =
    [MN 98:7.23](https://suttacentral.net/mn98/en/sujato#7.23). \| Pali
    has *cakkhuṁ loke* ("eye in the world"), Sanskrit has
    *cakṣur lokasya* ("eye of the world").

[^451]: These two reactions---grief and equanimity---are depicted often
    in Buddhist art and narrative. They stimulated the two poles of
    development of the Buddhist community. The devotional tradition,
    feeling the need for an emotional connection with the Teacher,
    developed art, story, and doctrines to, as it were, keep him alive,
    resulting in the Jātakas and the Bodhisattva doctrine.
    A cooler, rational tradition developed a comprehensive system
    analyzing the impermanence of "conditions", leading to the
    Abhidhamma.

[^452]: As for example at [MN
    24:2.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn24/en/sujato#2.1).

[^453]: *Manobhāvanīya* is explained in the commentaries as
    "those who, when seen, cause the mind to grow in what is skillful."

[^454]: These four sites are the primary destinations of modern Buddhist
    pilgrims in India. \| *Saṁvejanīya* is "stirring,
    provoking inspiration or urgency" such as when seeing an
    astonishing, disturbing, or amazing sight.

[^455]: Lumbinī in modern Nepal, which today is a
    well-maintained and quiet place for devotion and meditation. The
    site is marked with an Ashokan pillar dated perhaps 150 years after
    this time. On the pillar is inscribed in Brahmī
    characters *hida bhagavaṁ jāte ti*, which
    is a direct quote in Māgadhī of the Pali phrase here,
    *idha tathāgato jāto ti*.
    (*Tathāgata* "realized one" is how the Buddha referred
    to himself, while *bhagavā* "blessed one" is how his
    followers referred to him.) This is the oldest direct quote from the
    early canon preserved in the archaeological record.

[^456]: Bodhgaya in modern Bihar, which is called Uruvelā
    in the Pali texts. It is a bustling center for pilgrims from all
    over the Buddhist world, at the center of which is the great stupa
    next to the Bodhi tree.

[^457]: Isipatana is modern Sarnath, in the northern part of Varanasi on
    the Ganges. In the temple next to the park, the first sermon is
    recited every night. \| Note the passive voice, whereas the parallel
    at [AN 4.118](https://suttacentral.net/an4.118/en/sujato) is active.

[^458]: The phrase *nibbānadhātuyā parinibbuto*, "fully
    quenched in the element of extinguishment" shows how the Pali uses
    two roots simultaneously for Nibbana. The better-known term,
    *nibbāna* (Sanskrit *nirvāṇa*), is from
    the root *vā* ("to blow"), with the basic sense of
    going out through being deprived of air. The past participle form
    *nibbuta* (Sanskrit *nirvṛta*), from the root *var*
    ("to check or restrain"), has the basic sense of freedom from
    obstacles and constrictions. Generally, the Pali treats *nibbuta* as
    the past participle form of *nibbāna*, and for the most
    part the difference is purely verbal. Yet I believe the ambiguity is
    deliberate, as each captures a slightly different nuance of Nibbana.
    "Quenched" means both to go out like a flame and to be satisfied
    like a thirst. This positive feel appears in Sanskrit passages using
    *nirvṛta*, such as Manusmṛti 1.54, where
    it describes the blissful absorption of all beings into the great
    divinity. By using "extinguishment" for *nibbāna* and
    "quenched" for *nibbuta* I hope to express this subtle distinction,
    or at least to alert the reader that it exists.

[^459]: This passage is absent from the Sanskrit parallel and it is
    probably a late interpolation. Ānanda was handsome, and many stories
    of his encounters with women are preserved, for example at [Bu Pc
    41:1.1.5](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41/en/sujato#1.1.5).

[^460]: As it stands, this appears to contradict [MN
    152:2.10](https://suttacentral.net/mn152/en/sujato#2.10), where the
    Buddha ridicules the idea that sense restraint implies not seeing.
    The commentary, however, explains it as not looking at a woman who
    is standing in the doorway of a monk's hut, so as not to give rise
    to lust. Thus it restricts this apparently general rule to an
    unusually intimate encounter.

[^461]: The verb changes from *paṭipajjāma* (first person
    plural) to *paṭipajjitabbaṁ* (future passive
    participle), a shift that mirrors the following passage regarding
    the funeral proceedings. There, the shift to future passive
    participle indicates that the subject is the lay folk who carry out
    the funeral, whereas here that does not apply. This suggests that
    this passage has been derived from that later passage.

[^462]: The commentary refers to [AN
    5.55:6.5](https://suttacentral.net/an5.55/en/sujato#6.5), which
    speaks of chatting alone in private with a woman, a circumstance
    also dealt with in [Bu Pc
    45](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc45/en/sujato).

[^463]: Ānanda does not hesitate to let the Buddha know he has no
    intention of following his advice.

[^464]: The commentary says, quoting [SN
    35.127:1.6](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.127/en/sujato#1.6), that
    when a woman has sincere motivations, one should speak while
    thinking of them as a mother, a sister, or a daughter.

[^465]: "Corpse" is *sarīra*.

[^466]: For *abyāvaṭā* ("don't get involved"), compare
    *samaṇena bhavitabbaṁ
    abyāvaṭena* ("a monastic shouldn't get involved" (in
    domestic matters)) at [Bu Ss
    5:1.3.34](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5/en/sujato#1.3.34).

[^467]: Read *sadatthe* ("own goal") rather than *sāratthe*
    ("essential goal").

[^468]: An iron case was also used for Queen Bhaddā's body
    at [AN 5.50:1.6](https://suttacentral.net/an5.50/en/sujato#1.6). The
    second iron case does not "enclose" the first; rather it "crooks"
    (*paṭikujjati*) like a lid to "close it up".

[^469]: This is a rare mention of the *thūpa* ("sepulchral
    momunent") that became a major feature of the Buddhist landscape.
    Buddhist monuments were round in shape, which was apparently a
    characteristic of the lands around Magadha.
    Śatapathabrāhmaṇa 13.8.1.5 says that the correct form
    of such a monument was square, and that round monuments were built
    by godless "easterners".

[^470]: Here the Buddha is said to be explicitly instructing his
    followers to adopt the building of monuments from the local customs.

[^471]: "Independent Buddhas" are sages who discover the Dhamma and are
    awakened independently, but who do not themselves go on to found a
    dispensation or establish a monastic order. Text has
    *paccekasambuddho* rather than the usual *paccekabuddho*.

[^472]: This refers to the "eight individuals" who make up the
    "Saṅgha of disciples", namely those who have achieved
    the four stages of awakening and those on the path.

[^473]: In contrast with Ajātasattu.

[^474]: Like Queen Subhaddā, wife of
    Mahāsudassana, at [DN
    17:2.8.7](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato#2.8.7) and [DN
    17:2.12.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato#2.12.1). \|
    *Kapisīsa* is door-jamb, not lintel. \| For
    *vihāra* ("building") the commentary has "pavilion"
    (*maṇḍalamāla*), which may have been a temporary
    construction for the occasion (compare [MN
    92:4.6](https://suttacentral.net/mn92/en/sujato#4.6)).

[^475]: At this point Ānanda was a stream-enterer.

[^476]: When admonishing Ānanda, the Buddha first gently but firmly
    restrains him, then gives words of support and encouragement.

[^477]: The phrase "undivided and limitless" (*advayena
    appamāṇena*) normally describes *kasiṇa*
    meditation ([AN
    10.25:1.3](https://suttacentral.net/an10.25/en/sujato#1.3)); here it
    is also found in the Sanskrit: *ānanda
    maitreṇa kāyakarmaṇā hitena
    sukhenādvayenāpramāṇena*.

[^478]: On the eve of the First Council---in about six months
    time---Ānanda devoted himself to meditation and achieved
    arahantship.

[^479]: The same is said regarding the chief disciples
    Sāriputta and Moggallāna at [SN
    47.14:2.4](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.14/en/sujato#2.4) and
    regarding assemblies of deities at [DN
    20:4.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn20/en/sujato#4.3).

[^480]: *Tittha*, literally "ford", is a path to salvation, used as a
    term for a non-Buddhist "religion". *Titthakara* is a "religious
    founder" (literally "ford-maker"); *titthiya* is a "monastic of
    (another) religion" (for example at [Bu NP
    22:1.2.5](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np22/en/sujato#1.2.5));
    *titthiyasāvaka* is a "disciple of a monastic of
    (another) religion".

[^481]: As at [AN
    4.130:6.4](https://suttacentral.net/an4.130/en/sujato#6.4). Ānanda
    was in awe of the "incredible and amazing" qualities of the Buddha,
    and spoke of them often. Here, when Ānanda is at his most
    vulnerable, the Buddha turns the teaching around, pointing out that
    Ānanda is incredible and amazing too.

[^482]: This anticipates the story to follow.

[^483]: Campā, Rājagaha,
    Sāvatthī, and Kosambī were the capitals of
    Aṅga, Magadha, Kosala, and Vaccha respectively.
    Sāketa was the former capital of Kosala. Varanasi was
    formerly the capital of Kāsi, but at this time was
    contested by Kosala and Magadha, and had recently been won from
    Ajātasattu ([SN
    3.14](https://suttacentral.net/sn3.14/en/sujato), [SN
    3.15](https://suttacentral.net/sn3.15/en/sujato)).

[^484]: This story is also found in [DN
    17](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato). It seems that the Pali
    tradition extracted the story and greatly expanded it in an
    independent long discourse, whereas the Sanskrit tradition kept it
    at a more moderate length within the
    Mahāparinirvāṇasūtra itself.

[^485]: Kusāvatī features in the Kusajātaka
    ([Ja 531](https://suttacentral.net/ja531/en/sujato)), where the ugly
    but wise prince Kusa, son of the legendary Okkāka, wins
    the hand of the radiant Pabhāvatī. The
    Rāmāyaṇa also tells the story of a Kusa, son of
    Rāma, who ruled the city of Kusāvatī,
    although this city was located far to the south in the Vindhya
    ranges. Both stories are united by the detail that *kusa* grass, a
    prominent feature of Vedic ritual, ensured the kingly lineage.

[^486]: A "league" (*yojana*) is usually estimated at between seven and
    twelve kilometers. By way of comparison, even at its greatest extent
    under Ashoka, Pāṭaliputta was less than a league per
    side, so the dimensions of Kusāvatī here are strictly
    legendary.

[^487]: According to [DN 32](https://suttacentral.net/dn32/en/sujato),
    Āḷakamandā was one of the many cities of Kuvera in
    Uttarakuru.

[^488]: Vāseṭṭha is a Vedic priestly clan. The Mallas
    adopted the name of their priest's lineage, which was the normal
    custom for initiated *khattiyas*. Other examples in the Pali are
    Saccaka who is called Aggivessana ([MN
    35:4.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn35/en/sujato#4.2)), and the
    Buddha and his family who are called Gotama.

[^489]: *Attadutiyo* "with self as second" is also at [MN
    146:4.6](https://suttacentral.net/mn146/en/sujato#4.6) where Nandaka
    visits the nuns. Sanskrit has *bhikṣuṇā
    paścācchramaṇena* ("with a mendicant as accompanying
    ascetic"). It was apparently evening (the "wrong time",
    *vikāla*), when it is inappropriate for a monk to be
    wandering the town alone.

[^490]: Evidently the Mallas, like the Vajjis, met frequently.

[^491]: This is the second Subhadda we have met in this discourse, the
    first being a deceased devotee of Ñātika ([DN
    16:2.6.13](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#2.6.13)). The
    corrupt monk who, after the Buddha's death, urges the rejection of
    the Vinaya rules is another person of the same name ([DN
    16:6.20.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#6.20.1)). The
    Mahāsudassanasutta also features a Queen
    Subhaddā ([DN
    17:2.5.9](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato#2.5.9)).

[^492]: While some such as Mahāvīra the Ñātika
    ([MN 14:17.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn14/en/sujato#17.2)) and
    Pūraṇa Kassapa ([AN
    9.38:2.1](https://suttacentral.net/an9.38/en/sujato#2.1)) claimed to
    have direct knowledge, others such as Ajita Kesakambala denied that
    such knowledge was possible ([DN
    2:23.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#23.2)).

[^493]: The Buddha responded the same way when asked this question by
    the brahmin Piṅgalakoccha ([MN
    30:2.6](https://suttacentral.net/mn30/en/sujato#2.6)), and to a
    similar question at [AN
    9.38:3.2](https://suttacentral.net/an9.38/en/sujato#3.2).

[^494]: The four ascetics are defined at [AN
    4.241:1.1](https://suttacentral.net/an4.241/en/sujato#1.1) as those
    on the four paths.

[^495]: While many aspects of the eightfold path are shared with others,
    some details may be missing (such as not-self or
    Nibbāna), while others are added (such as the belief in
    the efficacy of rituals, an eternal soul, or a creator god).

[^496]: The Buddha points to the mendicants who have gathered there.

[^497]: This is the only place in the early texts where the Buddha
    identifies his age when going forth.

[^498]: Detailed in such suttas as [MN
    36](https://suttacentral.net/mn36/en/sujato).

[^499]: This verse appears to be corrupt. The sense can be restored
    through two extra lines in the Sanskrit: "Ethics, immersion,
    conduct, and knowledge, and unification of mind have been developed
    by me, teacher of the references for the noble teaching." \| For
    *padesavattī*, the Sanskrit has
    *pradeśavaktā*, where *vaktā* means
    "speaker" and *pradeśa* has the sense "pointing out". I
    think it means, "I am the one who taught the four great references
    (*mahāpadesa*)".

[^500]: The commentary says this line was added at the Council.

[^501]: This is similar to the idea of the Four Great references, and
    sets the scene for the First Council at which the teachings were
    recited. \| *Paññatto* here means "pointed out" rather
    than "laid down", as can be seen from [DN
    9:33.21](https://suttacentral.net/dn9/en/sujato#33.21), where the
    same phrase refers to the four noble truths.

[^502]: *Āvuso* is from the root *āyu* ("age") and thus has
    a respectful sense and does not mean "friend" as it is often
    translated. Like *bhante*, it is an indeclinable vocative of address
    that may be used with or without the name (see eg. [MN
    5:31.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn5/en/sujato#31.2)).

[^503]: I render *bhante* as "sir" when it stands alone and "honorable"
    when it prefixes a name. \| Unlike *bhante*, *āyasmā*
    ("venerable") is declinable, so it is used in parts of speech other
    than direct address. It is from the same root as
    *āvuso* but with a slightly more respectful tone,
    perhaps because it sounds more Sanskritic.

[^504]: These are not defined here, and the senior monks at the First
    Council were unable to agree on them ([Kd
    21:1.9.3](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd21/en/sujato#1.9.3)).
    Nonetheless, the Pali Vinaya consistently labels the
    Pācittiya rules as "lesser" (*khuddaka*; [Bu Pc
    92:2.2.22](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc92/en/sujato#2.2.22),
    [Bi Pc
    96:2.2.22](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc96/en/sujato#2.2.22),
    [Pvr
    1.1:219.3](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr1.1/en/sujato#219.3)),
    which would make the Pātidesanīyas "minor"
    (*anukhuddaka*). The Sekhiya rules are also "minor", but they were
    not at this point reckoned among the training rules for recitation.

[^505]: "Divine punishment" is *brahmadaṇḍa*. Channa
    features often in the Vinaya as a monk who refuses correction and
    acts disrespectfully. The Sangha had already imposed an act of
    "ejection" (*ukkhepanīyakamma*) on him due to his
    persistent bad behavior, but that was still not enough ([Kd
    1:25.1.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#25.1.1)).
    The *brahmadaṇḍa* was imposed at the First Council ([Kd
    1:1.12.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#1.12.1)),
    upon which Channa finally saw the error of his ways.
    *Brahmadaṇḍa* is encountered in a different sense at
    [DN 3:1.23.21](https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato#1.23.21).

[^506]: *Vattabba* in such contexts means "advise, correct" rather than
    more generally "speak to". Thus the *brahmadaṇḍa* is
    not the "silent treatment".

[^507]: The commentary says this line was added at the Council.

[^508]: Even on his deathbed, the Buddha retains mastery over his mind.

[^509]: Following the commentary, which reads this as a question.
    Anuruddha was renowned for his psychic powers. Note that Ānanda and
    Anuruddha have immediately adopted the forms of address recommended
    by the Buddha above.

[^510]: Each of these characters reveal something of themselves in their
    verses. Sahampati, as a royal deity, emphasizes the universal nature
    of the teaching and the grandeur of the Buddha.

[^511]: "Bag of bones" is a loose rendering of *samussaya*.

[^512]: Less creative than Brahmā, Sakka repeats a famous
    verse spoken by the Buddha at [SN
    15.20:8.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn15.20/en/sujato#8.1) and [DN
    17:2.17.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato#2.17.5).

[^513]: Anuruddha was a reclusive meditator who specialized in
    mindfulness of breathing.

[^514]: Ānanda has the most emotional reaction. While Anuruddha speaks
    only of peace, Ānanda empathizes with those who were distraught.

[^515]: Text omits "with hair disheveled" (*kese pakiriya*) when
    describing the shaven-headed monks.

[^516]: "Still on the same business" (*teneva karaṇīyena*)
    calls back to [DN
    16:5.20.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#5.20.1), where
    they were said to be "on some business" (*kenacideva
    karaṇīyena*). They had been discussing all night.

[^517]: An uplifting response to tragedy, full of beauty and
    celebration.

[^518]: It seem unlikely that everyone simply forgot. It was probably
    the custom to wait seven days before the cremation.

[^519]: "Unworn" is *ahata*, as at [DN
    14:1.33.9](https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#1.33.9) and [Kd
    1:1.6.2](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#1.6.2).

[^520]: "Coronation" is *makuṭabandhana*, "the binding of
    the crown". The commentary says there was, fittingly, an auspicious
    decorative royal hall there; perhaps too the name was felt to pun
    with *muktabandhana*, "freedom from ties".

[^521]: I think *sandhi* here means "covered without gaps".

[^522]: With the passing of Sāriputta and
    Moggallāna, Mahākassapa was the most
    senior of the remaining leading mendicants. As a solitary recluse,
    it was unusual for him to be travelling with such a large group, or
    with anyone at all really. He was to cite the events depicted here
    at the start of the First Council ([Kd
    1:1.1.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#1.1.1)).

[^523]: A follower of the Bamboo-staffed Ascetic Gosāla
    ([DN 2:19.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#19.1)). \| This
    may be an inspiration for the so-called "Flower Sermon", a medieval
    Zen story that depicts the Buddha holding up a flower and
    Mahakassapa smiling.

[^524]: Compare [Bu Pc
    72](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc72/en/sujato). The
    syntax is clumsy here, perhaps deliberately so.

[^525]: Here *sarīrāneva* is plural and so must mean
    "relics", whereas previously it was singular, "corpse".

[^526]: As when he was born ([DN
    14:1.28.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#1.28.1)).

[^527]: Ajātasattu would have learned of the news from
    spies. It is a 600 km round trip to Rājagaha and back,
    which a mounted messenger could make in fourteen days.

[^528]: A bold move, considering that his designs on the Vajjis were no
    secret. Perhaps he was seeking a pretext for war. The justification
    for taking a share of relics is caste, rather than practice of the
    Dhamma.

[^529]: Both the tribe and the town are exceedingly obscure, mentioned
    nowhere else in early texts. They must have been a small clan
    nearby.

[^530]: The Koliyans were south-eastern neighbors of the Sakyans, and
    several of their towns and people feature in the early texts.

[^531]: This brahmin is mentioned nowhere else.

[^532]: *Dassāma* ("we shall give") is the future second
    plural of *dadati*.

[^533]: The brahmin Doṇa appears suddenly in the narrative,
    a reminder that there were many more people than the ones who are
    mentioned. The suttas record two encounters with a brahmin of this
    name: one is the wondrous story of seeing the Buddhas footprints
    ([AN 4.36](https://suttacentral.net/an4.36/en/sujato)), while the
    other discusses the five kinds of brahmin ([AN
    5.192](https://suttacentral.net/an5.192/en/sujato)).

[^534]: The fear of war was justified and the resolution achieved by
    Doṇa probably marks the last time these parties
    achieved a diplomatic outcome. The relative peace that had lasted
    most of the Buddha's life was crumbling. We hear of war or threats
    of war between the Kosalans and the Magadhans, the Magadhans and the
    Vajjis, the Sakyans and the Koliyans, the Kosalans and the Mallas,
    and the Kosalans and the Sakyans. It is probably because of the
    latter two conflicts that Viḍūḍabha---Pasenadi's son
    and the newly crowned king of Kosala---did not send an emissary to
    the funeral. By sparking conflicts with former allies the Sakyans
    and Mallas, Viḍūḍabha undid the successes of his father
    and fatally weakened the Kosalan Empire. When the dust cleared a few
    decades later, all these lands had been consumed by Magadha.

[^535]: Thus begins the practice of establishing Buddhism by interring
    relics in a stupa.

[^536]: The Moriyas were a minor clan of the region, unmentioned outside
    of this passage, but their obscurity was not to last long. About a
    century after these events, Chandragupta the Moriyan, having won the
    Magadhan crown from the Nandas, proceeded to route the Greeks in the
    west. His empire, which covered most of northern India, was further
    expanded to the south by his son Bindusara and grandson Ashoka,
    under whom the Mauryan Empire became the greatest of all Indian
    empires. Thus Ajātasattu's expansionist dreams were
    ultimately fulfilled beyond his imagining.

[^537]: The commentary says this summary was added at the Council.

[^538]: The commentary says this line was added at the Third Council,
    which was held about 150 years after the Buddha under Ashoka. The
    Buddha's life was already fading into legend.

[^539]: According to the commentary, the remainder of the text was added
    by the monks of Sri Lanka. Note, however, that this verse and the
    next are fairly similar to those in the Sanskrit text. Since that is
    a northern text, it seems unlikely these verses were composed in Sri
    Lanka.

[^540]: "Offering" is *āyāga*.

[^541]: Picking up the story of the Buddha's past life as King
    Mahāsudassana from [DN
    16:5.17.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#5.17.1).

[^542]: From here we leave [DN
    16](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato) behind and with it any
    semblance of realism. Some of these details are shared with [SN
    22.96](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.96/en/sujato), which however
    does not mention the name Mahāsudassana.

[^543]: Readings vary. The Sanskrit text has *saptapauruṣā
    ardhacaturthapauruṣāś ca nikhātā*.

[^544]: I think the point is that they listened to the music rather than
    doing bad things.

[^545]: This is specific instance, so I use past tense. Where it is an
    abstract description of a legendary past, I use the present tense to
    denote an eternal or mythic present.

[^546]: The wheel is firstly the sun and secondly the wheel of the
    chariots that drove the Indo-Europeans in their conquests. It is the
    manifestation of unstoppable power. The solar imagery is reflected
    in the name Mahāsudassana ("Great Splendor"). The whole
    story reflects the Indo-European dream of universal domination.

[^547]: Many of the details in this myth echo the Brahmanical horse
    sacrifice. Since the horse was the primary source of Indo-European
    dominion, its sacrifice served to authorize the power of a king. It
    was a costly and dangerous rite that was attempted only by the
    greatest of sovereigns. \| *Bhiṅkāra* ("ceremonial
    vase") and *abbhukkirati* ("besprinkled") are elevated terms.

[^548]: In the horse sacrifice, the horse is released for a year, while
    the king follows it with his army, claiming any land that it wanders
    on as his.

[^549]: Read *bhuñjati* at [MN
    98:10.30](https://suttacentral.net/mn98/en/sujato#10.30) with
    *yathābhuttañca bhuñjatha* at [DN
    17:1.9.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato#1.9.4), [DN
    26:6.7](https://suttacentral.net/dn26/en/sujato#6.7), and [MN
    129:35.7](https://suttacentral.net/mn129/en/sujato#35.7). These have
    sometimes been rendered "eat", "enjoy", or "govern". But compare the
    archaic English "use" meaning "the benefit or profit of lands". Thus
    *yathābhuttañca bhuñjatha* means "use as
    has been used", i.e. "maintain the current level of taxation".

[^550]: The Wheel plunges into the seas, while the sacrificial horse is
    born in the western and eastern seas.

[^551]: Historically, India has usually been divided into squabbling
    realms, but from an early age there was a dream of a unified and
    peaceful continent.

[^552]: "At the High Court" (*atthakaraṇapamukhe*) is
    uncertain. *Attha-* has many variants, including
    *aḍḍa-* and *aṭṭa-*.
    *Atthakaraṇa* normally refers to a king "sitting in
    judgment" as at [SN
    3.7:1.5](https://suttacentral.net/sn3.7/en/sujato#1.5) or [MN
    89:13.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn89/en/sujato#13.3). Here,
    however it is a place. *-Pamukha* is a standard descriptor of the
    attributes of a wheel-turning monarch in the sense of "finest" (eg.
    [DN 17:2.5.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato#2.5.1)) rather
    than "entrance". Thus I take it as meaning "the supreme place of
    judgment" i.e. "High Court".

[^553]: The white elephant is a symbol of royalty to this day. The
    description recalls Indra's elephant Airāvata. \| For
    *sattappatiṭṭho*, the commentary has
    *susaṇṭhitaaṅgapaccaṅga* ("well-grounded on each and
    every limb"), a sense confirmed by the Mūlasarvāstivāda
    Bhaiṣajyavastu which has *saptāṅgaḥ
    supratiṣṭhito* ("well-established on seven limbs"). The
    subcommentary lists the four feet, trunk, tail, and penis
    (*varaṅga*).

[^554]: The sacrificial horse is likewise white with black head or
    forequarters. It is identified with the sun, thus being a
    "sky-walker". "Thundercloud" (*valāhaka*; Sanskrit
    *balāhaka*) is the name of one of the four horses of
    Kṛṣṇa's chariot in the Mahābharata. The
    description here also recalls the Vedic sacred horse
    *uccaiḥśravas*.

[^555]: The "commander" (*pariṇāyaka*) is mostly found in
    Buddhist texts of this context, and is not a regular term of
    governance. This passage shows that he was responsible for
    management of the realm, while below he appears as commander of the
    army ([DN 17:2.8.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato#2.8.2)).
    Elsewhere he is said to excel in strategy ([AN
    5.134:2.5](https://suttacentral.net/an5.134/en/sujato#2.5)).

[^556]: The jarring inclusion of "women" (*itthī*) in this
    list probably refers to state-sponsored prostitution.

[^557]: As at [DN 5:19.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn5/en/sujato#19.1).

[^558]: The palace is named "Principle" (*dhamma*) in recognition of the
    king being subject to a higher law. Normally I translate
    *pāsāda* as "stilt longhouse" but here something
    grander is meant.

[^559]: For *kūṭāgāra* as "chamber" see [MN
    37:8.10](https://suttacentral.net/mn37/en/sujato#8.10).

[^560]: Thus denying the doctrine of Pūraṇa Kassapa at [DN
    2:17.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#17.5). This is the
    recognition, at least partially, of right view.

[^561]: The *mahāviyūha* must have been some kind of
    structure at the entrance to the palace, a "foyer".

[^562]: These are the three factors of right thought. The king
    skillfully uses a transition in physical space to set up his
    intention to meditate.

[^563]: Here as in [DN 1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato),
    *jhāna* is not a uniquely Buddhist practice.

[^564]: This segment breaks the expected pattern of "foremost" things.

[^565]: Not the British car of the same name. The chariot is the source
    of victory in battle.

[^566]: Read *dukūlasandanāni*, where *dukūla*
    is "fine cloth, silk" and *sandana* is "cord, tether".

[^567]: An odd detail. Maybe the sound of the elephants disturbed his
    meditation?

[^568]: Like Ānanda at [DN
    16:5.13.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#5.13.1).

[^569]: He makes it clear that this will not be an intimate visit.

[^570]: The aorist is not past tense, as it is governed by
    *mā*.

[^571]: "Desire" is *chanda*, the first of the four bases of psychic
    power, which in [DN
    16:3.3.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#3.3.1) are said to
    lead to long life. By urging him to live long, she inverts the
    Mahāparinibbānasutta where Ānanda fails to do the same.

[^572]: Implying that Ānanda was right to not beg the Buddha to live
    long.

[^573]: At [AN 6.16:2.2](https://suttacentral.net/an6.16/en/sujato#2.2)
    this advice is given by Nakula's mother.

[^574]: Like Ānanda at [DN
    16:5.13.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#5.13.1).

[^575]: This contrasts with the Buddha's last meal at [DN
    16:4.20.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#4.20.1), which
    caused sickness and distress. The Buddha was rejecting existence
    entirely, whereas Mahāsudassana was continuing in a
    pleasant form of conditioned existence.

[^576]: After [DN
    5:21.16](https://suttacentral.net/dn5/en/sujato#21.16), this is the
    second Jātaka in the Dīghanikāya.

[^577]: Accepting the Mahāsaṅgīti's reading of
    *vessinī*. I believe the variant
    *velāmikā* is a ghost word contaminated from [AN
    9.20:4.1](https://suttacentral.net/an9.20/en/sujato#4.1).

[^578]: This picks up from the events of [DN
    16:2.5.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#2.5.1), which
    however discusses only the Ñātikans (who are reckoned
    among the Vajjis). Like [DN
    17](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato), it bears many signs of
    a late sutta. The overall theme is the presence of a cosmic order
    where the liberating teaching of the Buddha is reconciled with the
    requirements of worldly power.

[^579]: This list of ten nations is unique. The omission of the
    Aṅgas and Magadhans is noted below. The more famous
    list of "sixteen nations" adds Avanti and Assaka in the south, and
    Gandhāra and Kamboja in the north-west (eg. [AN
    3.70:28.3](https://suttacentral.net/an3.70/en/sujato#28.3)). The
    Buddha did not visit these lands, which explains why they are
    omitted.

[^580]: "Devotees" is *paricāraka*, which normally means
    "servant". It is not in the relevant passages of DN 16. This sense
    is found in only a couple of other places, both late ([Snp
    5.18:1.2](https://suttacentral.net/snp5.18/en/sujato#1.2), [Kd
    1:22.14.8](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#22.14.8)).

[^581]: Bearing in mind that none of the nations were actually mentioned
    in the relevant Mahāparinibbānasutta passage, this
    whole introduction is framed to emphasize the importance of Magadha
    to Buddhism, especially given the problematic character of
    Ajātasattu. In the decades following the Buddha's
    death, the Buddhist community adapted to a new political landscape
    which for a time saw the entirety of Buddhism contained within the
    sprawling Magadhan empire.

[^582]: As we known from [DN 2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato),
    Bimbisāra had recently been murdered by
    Ajātasattu.

[^583]: A not-so-subtle hint of the changes under
    Ajātasattu. The passing of Bimbisāra
    signifies the crumbling of the social order that prevailed in the
    Buddha's lifetime, bringing with it the immediate threat of war and
    chaos. This sutta establishes a timeless order that persists while
    worldly conditions fluctuate.

[^584]: Elsewhere the suttas say that Bimbisāra went for
    refuge ([DN 4:6.33](https://suttacentral.net/dn4/en/sujato#6.33)),
    while the Vinaya says he was in fact a stream-enterer ([Kd
    1:22.9.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#22.9.1)),
    which is confirmed below. The Jains, however, claim him as one of
    their own but say he went to hell for committing suicide. Like his
    son Ajātasattu, it is likely that he frequented several
    teachers in his realm.

[^585]: Near the town of Uruvelā on the bank of the
    Nerañjarā River at the place known today as Bodhgaya.

[^586]: "Suggestion" is *parikathaṁ*, which elsewhere
    occurs in the Vinaya ([Kd
    7:1.5.16](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd7/en/sujato#1.5.16)) and
    the Abhidhamma Vibhaṅga ([Vb
    17:43.2](https://suttacentral.net/vb17/en/sujato#43.2)) in the sense
    of "hint".

[^587]: Normally *aṭṭhiṁ katvā
    manasikatvā sabbaṁ cetasā
    samannāharitvā* describes listening to Dhamma. This
    whole process seems unusually laborious.

[^588]: *Nāmadheyyaṁ* means "name (borne by someone or
    something)", not "one who bears the name" ([MN
    50:22.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn50/en/sujato#22.1)).

[^589]: *Janavasabha* is "chief of men", spelled *janesabha* at [DN
    20:10.10](https://suttacentral.net/dn20/en/sujato#10.10) and [DN
    32:10.9](https://suttacentral.net/dn32/en/sujato#10.9). The synonym
    *narāsabha* is an occasional poetic epithet of the
    Buddha ([Snp
    3.11:6.2](https://suttacentral.net/snp3.11/en/sujato#6.2), [Snp
    5.1:21.3](https://suttacentral.net/snp5.1/en/sujato#21.3), [SN
    11.3:14.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn11.3/en/sujato#14.2)). In
    Sanskrit we find *puruṣaṛṣabha* in the same sense.

[^590]: *Uḷāravaṇṇa* describes beautiful people at [MN
    96:7.8](https://suttacentral.net/mn96/en/sujato#7.8).

[^591]: Read *ito*. I think this implies what is stated more explicitly
    in Anuruddha's partly parallel verses at [Thag
    16.9:23.1](https://suttacentral.net/thag16.9/en/sujato#23.1): after
    each of seven rebirths under Vessavaṇa he can become a
    king of men. This explains the name Janavasabha.

[^592]: It is rare to see *saṁsāra* used as a countable
    noun, but see [Thag
    2.48:2.2](https://suttacentral.net/thag2.48/en/sujato#2.2).

[^593]: As a stream-enterer he is freed from any lower rebirths, yet he
    still aspires to a higher realization.

[^594]: In this idiom, the verb for "aware" varies between
    *sañjānāti*, *jānāti*,
    *pajānāti*, and *sampajānāti*.

[^595]: Compare [SN
    1.50:5.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn1.50/en/sujato#5.1) and [SN
    2.24:6.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn2.24/en/sujato#6.1).

[^596]: It is not just the Vajjis and the Buddhist Saṅgha
    who meet frequently in a hall to discuss business, but the gods as
    well. Here we get a rare glimpse into how the heavens work, or more
    to the point, how depictions of heavenly proceedings act as a
    template for how things should be on earth.

[^597]: The thirty-three and the Four Great Kings are both present; the
    heavenly realms are not shut off from one another.

[^598]: For *vipakkamati* compare [MN
    127:11.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn127/en/sujato#11.1).

[^599]: Compare [DN
    11:80.12](https://suttacentral.net/dn11/en/sujato#80.12).

[^600]: For *vipāko bhavissati* in discerning the results
    of signs, compare [DN
    1:1.24.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#1.24.2).

[^601]: See [AN
    3.127:2.3](https://suttacentral.net/an3.127/en/sujato#2.3).

[^602]: This phrase is also at [DN
    19:16.8](https://suttacentral.net/dn19/en/sujato#16.8), but apart
    from that the words *pakativaṇṇa* ("normal
    appearance"), *anabhisambhavanīya* ("imperceptible"),
    and *cakkhupatha* ("visual range") are all unique in the early
    texts.

[^603]: For the unique term "human form" (*mānusaṁ
    viggahaṁ*) compare the Vinaya phrase
    *manussaviggahaṁ* ([Bu Pj
    3:2.49.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3/en/sujato#2.49.1)).

[^604]: Also appearing in [DN
    21:1.8.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn21/en/sujato#1.8.3), [DN
    20:10.11](https://suttacentral.net/dn20/en/sujato#10.11), and [SN
    35.119](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.119/en/sujato),
    Pañcasikha ("Five-Crest") was a handsome and virile
    deity of the *gandhabbas*.

[^605]: *Bhāsittha* is 3rd singular aorist middle voice.

[^606]: Compare [MN
    91:21.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn91/en/sujato#21.4).

[^607]: Everything Sanaṅkumāra says is just a bit off. Here
    he adopts an idiom commonly used by the Buddha, but in third person
    rather than the Buddha's second person; and he asks only
    rhetorically, where the Buddha engages with his audience. If it were
    only this one example it would mean nothing, but similar changes
    happen throughout. I believe this is a subtle literary device that
    tells two narratives to two audiences. To potential converts it
    sounds like Sanaṅkumāra is giving a ringing and learned
    endorsement of Buddhism, while to knowledgeable Buddhists he appears
    as less than well versed in the teachings. I note these eccentric
    wordings as we proceed.

[^608]: The sutta began by recounting those who have achieved various
    stages of awakening. But escape from rebirth threatens the gods;
    this potentially fraught relationship is played out in [MN
    49](https://suttacentral.net/mn49/en/sujato).
    Sanaṅkumāra is preempting such arguments by pointing
    out that many of the Buddha's followers are reborn among the gods
    and do not escape transmigration, at least not for now. This is no
    trivial metaphysical argument. In order for Buddhism to prevail, it
    must show that its radical soteriology is compatible with worldly
    prosperity, lest it face opposition from kings and other temporal
    powers. The gods act as proxies to demonstrate the appropriate
    behavior for terrestrial kings. This is why the leading character is
    Bimbisāra/Janavasabha, who straddles the two realms.

[^609]: Sanaṅkumāra begins sharing the Buddha's teaching
    with the gods, starting with the bases of psychic power that
    featured prominently in DN 16. Here, however, he focuses on the
    worldly dimensions of psychic powers, ignoring the liberating
    dimension that was central to the Buddha. This sets the pattern for
    the teachings to follow, except for the very last.

[^610]: *Yāva supaññattā*, which is also at
    [MN 51:4.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn51/en/sujato#4.3), is a
    variation of the common exclamation *yāva
    subhāsita*. The phrase *iddhipahutāya
    iddhivisavitāya iddhivikubbanatāya* is
    unique. The Paṭisambhidāmagga draws on this passage to
    explain *vikubbana* both as a general term for development of
    psychic powers ([Ps
    3.2:4.3](https://suttacentral.net/ps3.2/en/sujato#4.3)) and as
    specific kind of psychic power, namely the transformation of one's
    apparent form as demonstrated by Sanaṅkumāra ([Ps
    3.2:15.1](https://suttacentral.net/ps3.2/en/sujato#15.1)).

[^611]: These "three opportunities" are not found elsewhere.

[^612]: This unique term is the reverse of the phrase that begins the
    first *jhāna*. The passage, however, speaks only of
    lifestyle rather than deep meditation.

[^613]: "Aloof" (*asaṁsaṭṭha*) is a synonym of "secluded"
    (*vivicca*). The *jhāna* formulas are extremely stable
    and it is rare to find them played with like this.

[^614]: Since *jhāna* arises from pleasure, it cannot be
    meant here.

[^615]: "Coarse physical, verbal, and mental processes"
    (*oḷārikā kāyasaṅkhārā
    ...vacīsaṅkhārā ... cittasaṅkhārā*) is
    another unique term. They are probably to be identified with the
    three "processes" of [MN
    44:14.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn44/en/sujato#14.2).

[^616]: This builds off [DN
    1:2.24.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#2.24.1), but the
    full phrase is only here and [DN
    19:7.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn19/en/sujato#7.2).

[^617]: Normally *satipaṭṭhāna* is taught "in order to
    purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an
    end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to
    realize extinguishment" (eg. [DN
    22:1.7](https://suttacentral.net/dn22/en/sujato#1.7)). Here, in yet
    another unique phrasing, a more humble goal is sought.

[^618]: Again the liberating dimension is ignored in favor of worldly
    psychic abilities. This is another unique formulation.

[^619]: Also found at [AN
    7.45:1.1](https://suttacentral.net/an7.45/en/sujato#1.1). At [MN
    44:12.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn44/en/sujato#12.4) the four
    right efforts are said to be the "prerequisites of immersion". Here
    at last Sanaṅkumāra introduces the liberating dimension
    of the path as a whole.

[^620]: Also at [SN 45.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.1/en/sujato),
    etc.

[^621]: To the standard passage on the qualities of the Dhamma,
    Sanaṅkumāra clumsily tacks on the line spoken by the
    Buddha when he was persuaded by Brahmā to teach ([SN
    6.1:10.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn6.1/en/sujato#10.1), [DN
    14:3.7.13](https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#3.7.13), [MN
    26:21.6](https://suttacentral.net/mn26/en/sujato#21.6), [MN
    85:45.6](https://suttacentral.net/mn85/en/sujato#45.6)).

[^622]: Finally the question is answered, although the number of deaths
    is obviously exaggerated. We cannot estimate the population size at
    the time with any confidence. But we know that
    Pāṭaliputta under Ashoka covered about 25 km², which
    suggests a population somewhere around 250,000. Probably there were
    a few million people in the whole of Magadha.

[^623]: The commentary identifies these as non-returners, but this is
    unlikely as *puññābhāga* ("share of merit") indicates
    those who do good for the sake of a good rebirth rather than
    liberation ([AN
    6.63:30.2](https://suttacentral.net/an6.63/en/sujato#30.2)). There
    would have been countless more of such good folk than
    stream-enterers, whereas the number of non-returners, as indicated
    by the count of the Ñātikans, would have been small,
    not "countless". This verse is also at [SN
    6.13:7.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn6.13/en/sujato#7.1), where the
    commentary says nothing of non-returners.

[^624]: Sanaṅkumāra lives longer than the lesser gods so he
    has a broader perspective. He emphasizes the long-term stability of
    cosmic order, which prevails through the crises that afflict the
    short-lived kingdoms of men.

[^625]: Astonishingly, this sutta traces its textual lineage directly to
    Brahmā, exactly like the Brahmanical texts (eg.
    Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.5.4). Of course,
    Brahmā gets his teaching from the Buddha, but this is
    clearly copying the Brahmanical model.

[^626]: Here Ānanda plays a key role as the linchpin of the oral
    tradition. It is likely that not just the
    Mahāparinibbānasutta itself, but all these suttas of
    this cycle were composed by Ānanda or his students.

[^627]: With this unique ending, there is no claim that this sutta was
    heard by the mendicants in the usual way. Rather it makes its
    purpose explicit, to act as a means to widely propagate the Dhamma.
    The Mahāparinibbānasutta also speaks of the spread of
    the Dhamma, and the Janavasabhasutta indicates some of the means by
    which that was achieved in the decades following the Buddha's death;
    in particular, by allying itself with the ascendant power of
    Magadha.

[^628]: We were introduced to Pañcasikha in [DN
    18](https://suttacentral.net/dn18/en/sujato), which is similar to
    the current sutta in many other details as well. Thus this sutta can
    be considered as a distant cousin to the
    Mahāparinibbāna cycle.

[^629]: The council of gods described by Janavasabha at [DN
    18:12.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn18/en/sujato#12.1), while
    otherwise similar, took place at the entry to a rainy season,
    whereas this one is at the end of a rainy season. This cannot have
    been the Buddha's last rains, for he was already in Vajji by then.

[^630]: For "genuine praise" (*yathābhucce
    vaṇṇe*), see [DN
    1:1.28.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#1.28.1).

[^631]: This set of eight is not found elsewhere. \| "Proffered" is
    *payirudāhāsi*, a unique term in early texts.

[^632]: Sakka adopts the same rhetorical style as
    Sanaṅkumāra ([DN
    18:20.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn18/en/sujato#20.2)).

[^633]: Compare [DN
    18:25.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn18/en/sujato#25.1).

[^634]: *Paṭipadā* is instrumental.

[^635]: I don't think this idea is found elsewhere in quite this way.
    Normally it is said that the path leads to Nibbāna like
    the rivers lead to the ocean (eg. [SN
    45.114:1.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.114/en/sujato#1.1)).

[^636]: This item is unique.

[^637]: Another unique item.

[^638]: This is normally true, but in some cases the Buddha left a
    badly-behaved community ([MN
    48](https://suttacentral.net/mn48/en/sujato)), dismissed misbehaving
    monks (eg. [AN
    8.10:2.2](https://suttacentral.net/an8.10/en/sujato#2.2)), or even
    dismissed a large community ([MN
    67](https://suttacentral.net/mn67/en/sujato)). \| The "joy of
    solitude" is *ekārāmataṁ* .

[^639]: Also at [DN
    29:29.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato#29.5), [AN
    4.23:4.1](https://suttacentral.net/an4.23/en/sujato#4.1), and [Iti
    112:5.1](https://suttacentral.net/iti112/en/sujato#5.1).

[^640]: *Pariyositasaṅkappo* ("achieved all he wished for")
    is a synonym of the more common *paripuṇṇasaṅkappo*
    (eg. [MN 29:2.5](https://suttacentral.net/mn29/en/sujato#2.5)).

[^641]: This impossibility is also at [AN
    1.277:1.1](https://suttacentral.net/an1.277/en/sujato#1.1) and [MN
    115:14.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn115/en/sujato#14.1). \| "In one
    solar system" (*ekissā lokadhātuyā*): a
    single *lokadhātu* encompasses a single terrestrial
    world with a single moon and sun.

[^642]: It is not common to wish for the Buddha's long life, but we do
    find this sentiment expressed in a conversation between
    Sāriputta and Ānanda ([SN
    21.2:3.5](https://suttacentral.net/sn21.2/en/sujato#3.5)).

[^643]: "Having appraised" (*saṅkhāya*) is glossed by the
    commentary with "having known" (*jānitvā*). Compare the
    discussion on "judgmentalism" at [DN
    1:1.3.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#1.3.1).

[^644]: Disampati means "head of the directions", i.e. king of all the
    land. He and his story are found nowhere else in the early texts.

[^645]: "Steward" is Govinda, literally "lord of cows". The "high
    priest" (*purohita*) was a hereditary office, a learned ritualist
    and adviser attached to a specific family. For royal families the
    post could be highly contested. The closeness of the role is shown
    in that aristocratic families could be referred to by the lineage of
    the high priest.

[^646]: While the current sutta does not explicitly identify their
    realm, Dīpavaṁsa iii 40 records Disampati and
    Reṇu as kings of Kāsi. This fits with the
    geographical layout depicted in this sutta, with Kāsi
    at the center. The story, then, depicts the establishment of
    Brahmanical kings across India from Kāsi.

[^647]: Jotipāla means "guardian of the sacred flame", i.e.
    someone who maintains the Vedic fire ritual (see below at [DN
    19:47.26](https://suttacentral.net/dn19/en/sujato#47.26)). There was
    another Jotipāla in the time of Buddha Kassapa at [MN
    81:6.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn81/en/sujato#6.2), and another
    who was a religious founder of the past ([AN
    6.54:18.1](https://suttacentral.net/an6.54/en/sujato#18.1), [AN
    7.73:2.5](https://suttacentral.net/an7.73/en/sujato#2.5)). Despite
    the popularity of the name in Pali, it does not seem to appear in
    Sanskrit sources. Given that it appears in Pali only in legendary
    contexts, it is probably a vocational epithet.

[^648]: The king's only care, it seems, is not for the passing of his
    friend, but that he no longer gets to indulge in whatever he wants.

[^649]: This shows that Govinda is an office rather than a personal
    name.

[^650]: Following the Mahāsaṅgīti reading rather than the
    PTS (*nānusāsi ... nānusāsati*). It seems
    required by the context that he does more than his father.

[^651]: Following PTS reading *sukhaṁ
    edheyyātha*.

[^652]: The meaning of *sakaṭamukhaṁ* ("front of a cart")
    is clarified by comparison with the parallels. T 8 is identical (),
    while DA 3 expresses a similar idea more briefly (). The
    Mahāvastu (Mvu 85.17) confirms this sense with
    *dakṣiṇena saṁkṣiptā
    śakaṭamukhasaṁsthitaṁ*. These appear to demonstrate a
    knowledge of the shape of the Indian subcontinent. Below it says
    that each of the kingdoms is shaped like the front of a cart, just
    as India is as a whole.

[^653]: Neither Rhys Davids nor Walshe translate this line, but it
    receives an extensive discussion in the commentary. It says that six
    kingdoms were arranged around Reṇu's kingdom in the
    middle, like an umbrella (*vitānasadisaṁ*).

[^654]: The verses tell the realms starting with the rising sun at
    Kaliṅga in the east and proceeding clockwise
    (*padakkhiṇā*) until the circle is complete with
    Aṅga on the Kaliṅga border. Thus the
    original center was probably the last place on the list,
    Kāsi, which is indeed geographically central.

[^655]: Kaliṅga was a coastal realm in modern Odisha and
    Andhra Pradesh. There is no consensus on the exact location of
    Dantapura.

[^656]: Assaka stretched from Kaliṅga's western border
    across the interior. Potana is modern Bodhan in Telangana state.

[^657]: *Mahesaya* of the Pali editions is a variant spelling for
    *māhissatī*; Mahāvastu has
    *māhiṣmatī*. It is in present-day Madhya Pradesh, on
    the banks of Narmada River, and is perhaps to be identified with
    modern Maheshwar.

[^658]: Sovīra was on the lower Indus, and Roruka is
    identified with modern Rohri in Sindh province, Pakistan. It is
    implausible that they received Aryan culture from Kāsi.

[^659]: Mithilā was the capital of Videha, to the north
    east of the Vajjian federation, nestled against the Himalayas.
    Mithilā was a dominant kingdom before the Buddha, its
    king Janaka featuring prominently in early Upaniṣads.
    It features rarely in the suttas ([MN
    91](https://suttacentral.net/mn91/en/sujato), [Thig
    6.2](https://suttacentral.net/thig6.2/en/sujato), [Thig
    13.4](https://suttacentral.net/thig13.4/en/sujato)) and had
    apparently declined in importance. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
    1.4.1.10--19 depicts its origins in terms of the spread of
    fire-worship from the west by its founding king Māthava
    Videgha with his priest Gotama Rāhūgaṇa.

[^660]: Campā is modern Champapuri near Bhagalpur in Bihar
    state, not far from West Bengal. Aṅga lay between the
    Chandan river to the west and the Rajmahal hills to the east. In the
    centuries before the Buddha it expanded its dominion to the sea on
    the south-east and Magadha in the west. But with the
    Kaliṅgas pushing back from the coast and the rise of
    Bimbisāra in Magadha, they were pushed back to their
    ancestral lands and fell under Magadhan dominion.

[^661]: Varanasi, one of the oldest cities in the world, was the capital
    of the Kāsī kingdom. It lost its status as an
    independent kingdom shortly before the Buddha, when it was taken
    over by Kosala. It appears in countless Buddhist stories of the past
    as the dominant city of the region in what appears to be a timeless
    and ageless past. However, despite its great antiquity, it is a
    historical settlement, of which the discovered remains date back to
    perhaps 1200 BCE; it was a capital city from perhaps 800 BCE.

[^662]: The names of the aristocrat kings---most of which are difficult
    to identify from other sources---are listed in an abruptly-inserted
    verse. The names are missing from the parallels in
    Mahāvastu and DA 3, but T 8 appears to have the same
    list of names in the same order, except with Reṇu at
    the start. Rhys Davids proposes to assign each one to a kingdom as
    listed in the same order. This seems to work for the first four
    names, as [Ja 424](https://suttacentral.net/ja424/en/sujato),
    invoking this sutta, identifies Bharata as king of
    Sovīra. But it falls apart with Reṇu, who
    as we have seen, belongs in Kāsi rather than Videha.

[^663]: "Bharata" is the name of an individual king, while they are
    collectively known as "Bhāratas" (with a long initial
    *ā* due to secondary derivation). [Ja
    424](https://suttacentral.net/ja424/en/sujato), invoking this sutta,
    identifies Bharata as king of Sovīra.

[^664]: Here *bhāratā* means "kings of India" or perhaps,
    if read together with the preceding verses, "kingdoms of India".
    India was called Bhārata after the legendary King
    Bharata of Hastināpura (Delhi), founder of the Lunar
    dynasty, conqueror of India, and sire of the warring tribes of the
    Mahābharata. His story is told in the
    Saṁbhavapara of the Mahābhārata. The name
    represents the success of Vedic culture across the subcontinent.

[^665]: In spiritual circles, such rumors spread like wildfire in an
    Australian summer.

[^666]: The ancient Brahmanical teachers are invoked to justify the
    Buddhist rains retreat. \| Compassion is one of the "meditations of
    Brahmā" (*brahmavihāra*). Normally the
    suttas speak of the absorptions (*jhāna*) and of the
    meditation on compassion (*karuṇā*), but the idea of an
    "absorption on compassion" is unique to this sutta.

[^667]: Compare [MN
    51:10.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn51/en/sujato#10.3), where the
    same construction is a site for the sacrifice.

[^668]: "Deathless" from a Brahmanical perspective, but very much within
    the realm of *saṁsāra* from a Buddhist perspective.

[^669]: *Brahme* is the normal vocative for *brahmā*.
    However in verse it is sometimes used as vocative for
    *brāhmaṇa* (eg. [Snp
    5.1:7.3](https://suttacentral.net/snp5.1/en/sujato#7.3), [Snp
    5.19:3.4](https://suttacentral.net/snp5.19/en/sujato#3.4)).

[^670]: These factors are explained as a summary of the Gradual
    Training.

[^671]: "At one" (*ekodibhūta* or more commonly
    *ekodibhāva*) normally describes deep meditation, and
    is part of the formula for the second *jhāna*. Here it
    is explained as equivalent to "seclusion" (*viveka*).

[^672]: "Putrefaction" (*āmagandha*) is the smell of
    (moral) decay or corruption ([AN
    3.128](https://suttacentral.net/an3.128/en/sujato), [Snp
    2.2](https://suttacentral.net/snp2.2/en/sujato)).

[^673]: "Desire" is (*icchā*). PTS reads
    *vicikicchā* ("doubt"), but this must be incorrect as
    the commentary explains it as "craving" (*taṇhā*).

[^674]: "Easy to quell" (*sunimmadaya*) is unique to this passage.

[^675]: As noted in the comment to [DN
    16:5.19.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#5.19.2), kingly
    clans adopted the lineage name of the high priest (*purohita*)
    during initiation.

[^676]: "True teaching" (*saddhamma*) normally describes the Buddha's
    teaching.

[^677]: "Leads to rebirth in the Brahmā realm"
    (*brahmalokūpapattiyā*), just as the teaching of
    Āḷāra Kālāma, based on the even more
    refined formless meditations, leads to rebirth in the dimension of
    nothingness ([MN
    36:14.14](https://suttacentral.net/mn36/en/sujato#14.14)).

[^678]: Echoing the ancient hermit Araka at [AN
    7.74:2.2](https://suttacentral.net/an7.74/en/sujato#2.2), who said
    life is evanescent like a dewdrop.

[^679]: It is regarded as normal that woman should renounce.

[^680]: Compare with the mass renunciation under Vipassī
    ([DN 14:2.16.6](https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#2.16.6)).

[^681]: His meditation expands from compassion to include all four of
    the *brahmavihāras*.

[^682]: This is the third and final Jātaka in the
    Dīghanikāya, after [DN
    5](https://suttacentral.net/dn5/en/sujato) and [DN
    17](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato).

[^683]: According to the doctrine of the "perfections"
    (*pāramī*), which emerged around two to four centuries
    after the Buddha's passing, the practices he undertook in past lives
    laid the foundation for awakening in this life. Here, however, the
    Buddha states that his former practices did not lead to awakening.
    Rather, since they were based on the wrong view of eternal bliss in
    the Brahmā realm, they only led to a good rebirth so
    long as that kamma lasted. It is the eightfold path, which the
    Buddha discovered in his final life, which leads to awakening. The
    same saying in a similar context is found at [MN
    83:21.7](https://suttacentral.net/mn83/en/sujato#21.7).

[^684]: This discourse gives an extensive account of divine beings. Some
    are familiar from elsewhere in the Pali texts, others found in
    various Brahmanical sources, while still others occur only here. For
    the names we can compare the edition of the Sanskrit text by
    Waldschmidt and Sander and available on SuttaCentral as [SF
    140](https://suttacentral.net/sf140/san/waldschmidt-sander).

[^685]: The Pure Abodes are inhabited entirely by non-returners.

[^686]: "Great congregation" is *mahāsamaya*.

[^687]: A village ([Bu Pj
    2:3.8](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2/en/sujato#3.8)) or
    royal compound ([Bu Pc
    83:1.3.56.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83/en/brahmali#1.3.56.1))
    was marked with a "boundary post" (*indakhīla*). It
    symbolized a fixed and immovable point, either in a good sense ([SN
    56.39:4.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.39/en/sujato#4.1)) or, as
    here, an obstacle. \| For Mahāsaṅgīti's
    *ūhacca manejā* read
    *ūhacca-m-anejā*.

[^688]: *Nāga* can refer to a class of semi-divine beings
    in a powerful serpentine form ("dragon"); a large and powerful
    snake, especially a king cobra; a bull elephant; or any powerful and
    mighty being ("giant").

[^689]: The discourse up to here is also found at [SN
    1.37](https://suttacentral.net/sn1.37/en/sujato).

[^690]: This recalls [DN
    14:1.10.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#1.10.1), where
    the relative sizes of the mendicant congregations of different
    Buddhas are tallied. That sutta, in another point of similarity,
    also featured a conversation with deities of the Pure Abodes.

[^691]: "Paean of praise" is *siloka*, a rare case where this means
    "verse (of praise)" rather than "fame, renown". \|
    *Anukassāmi* is present tense from the root *kass*, "to
    draw (up), to drag". Compare Sanskrit *anukarṣa* in the
    sense "invoking, summoning by incantation".

[^692]: This gives a hint as to one of the purposes of this sutta.
    Living alone in remote forests can be terrifying. Such places were
    widely believed to be haunted by all manner of supernatural
    creatures, not all of them friendly. While for an arahant this posed
    no threat, there would have been then, as there are today, many
    young or aspiring meditators who faced such challenges with
    trepidation. These verses offer succor, surrounding them with
    powerful, albeit invisible, allies.

[^693]: "Spirit" is *yakkha*. In later legend they appear as monstrous
    figures, but in the suttas they are ambiguous and may often be
    friendly to the Dhamma. Early statues of *yakkhas* at
    Madhurā (circa 100 BCE) depict noble and powerful
    kings, not ogres. *Yakkha* is also sometimes used more generally in
    the sense of an individual or deity.

[^694]: Colorful like the nymphs of [MN
    50:25.6](https://suttacentral.net/mn50/en/sujato#25.6) or
    Susīma's gods at [SN
    2.29:7.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn2.29/en/sujato#7.1).

[^695]: Mount Sātā is unidentified, but according to the
    commentary it was in the middle region.

[^696]: Vessāmitta ("friend of all") is the name of a Vedic
    hermit. Legend has it that he was a *khattiya* who earned
    brahminhood due to his intense austerities in the remote Himalayas.
    Perhaps this is a mountain named for him, although I can find no
    trace of it in Sanskrit.

[^697]: *Kumbhīra* means "crocodile".

[^698]: We met two human King Dhataraṭṭhas ("Strongrealm")
    in the Mahāgovindasutta.

[^699]: "Centaur" is *gandhabba*. *Gandhabbas* are wild, sexual beings
    who, being first to yoke the horse (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
    5.1.4.8) and riding the steed called "Racer" (*vājin*,
    10.6.4.1), "take the reins" from Indra (Rig Veda 1.163.2) as his
    charioteer Mātali. It is likely the Sanskrit
    *gandharva* stems from the same root as the Greek *kentauro*, and
    the ultimate origin of the idea comes from the proto-Indo-Europeans,
    who rode the horse, creating a potent entity that was invincible in
    battle.

[^700]: By implication, they are renowned as being powerful as Indra,
    the king of gods who in Pali is more commonly called Sakka. It is
    also a nod to the multiplicity of divinities in the Vedic system,
    where one becomes many and many become one.

[^701]: *Virūḷhaka* is "growth"; he was probably a god of
    the fertile crops. In the Pali it is spelled Virūḷha
    here due to the meter.

[^702]: "Goblins" is *kumbhaṇḍa*, a race of lesser deities
    often depicted as ugly and misshapen. On the face of it,
    *kumbhaṇḍa* means "potballs", i.e. deities whose
    testicles are as big as pots. Perhaps more likely they are related
    to the beings known as *kuṣmāṇḍa* in Sanskrit, whose
    bellies are round as "pumpkins".

[^703]: One of the "royal snake families" at [AN
    4.67:3.2](https://suttacentral.net/an4.67/en/sujato#3.2). His name
    means "multiple eyes" (*virūpa-akkha*) for the false
    eyes on a cobra's hood.

[^704]: Also known as Vessavaṇa ([DN
    32:7.43](https://suttacentral.net/dn32/en/sujato#7.43), [Snp
    2.14:6.1](https://suttacentral.net/snp2.14/en/sujato#6.1)), which
    means "Son of the Renowned" from his father Viśrava.
    These two names appear together elsewhere in contemporary literature
    (Atharvaveda 8,10.28c, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 13.4.3.10),
    where, although the passages are obscure, he appears to be
    associated with wickedness, concealment, and theft. Although a god
    of wealth (*dhanada*), the name Kuvera is explained by
    lexicographers as "deformed". Probably he was originally a god of
    the underground, blessed with the earth's riches, yet deformed by
    its great pressure.

[^705]: The following verses are a treasure-trove of ancient Indian
    mythology, recording the names of deities otherwise lost to history.
    Many of the names are obscure and variant readings are recorded in
    manuscripts and noted in the commentary. My spellings follow
    Ānandajoti's translation, *[The Discourse on the Great
    Convention](https://suttacentral.nethttp://www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net/Texts-and-Translations/Safeguard/02x-Atirekani-Sattasuttani-23.htm)*,
    unless there is a reason to change. I try to identify the deities as
    best as I can, but many of them remain speculative.

[^706]: These deities are called *dāsa*, which normally
    means "slave" in Pali. But here, it seems, we have a singular
    instance of the old Vedic meaning, an uncivilized foe. The
    *dāsas* Vṛtra, Namuci, and
    Vṛṣaśipra are described as "deceivers"
    (*māyin*, Rig Veda 1.53.7; 2.11.10; 7.99.4; 10.73.7).
    This epithet is also used of the closely related *dasyu* (Rig Veda
    1.33.10; 4.16.9; 8.14.14; 10.73.5; see note on [DN
    5:11.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn5/en/sujato#11.5)). Such beings
    are said to be "godless" since they oppose the Vedic deities (Rig
    Veda 2.19.7; 3.31.19; 7.1.10; 10.11.6; 10.138.4, etc.), so we can
    translate as "heathen".

[^707]: I am not able to identify any of these names with confidence,
    but perhaps *kuṭeṇḍu* and *viṭeṇḍu* could
    be traced to *indu* ("moon"), thus "crooked moon" and "defective
    moon". Compare *khaṇḍendu*, a later term for Śiva as
    the crescent moon.

[^708]: The Sanskrit names are *kiṭi*,
    *vikiṭi*, *bhṛgu*, and
    *bhṛkuṭi*. Only *bhṛgu* is attested in the
    Vedas, but he was a sage, not a "crafty heathen".

[^709]: Candana appears in [MN
    134:6.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn134/en/sujato#6.4) and [SN
    40.11:1.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn40.11/en/sujato#1.1), and
    together with Kāmaseṭṭha in [DN
    32:10.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn32/en/sujato#10.4). *Candana*
    means "sandalwood", although the name of the god might also relate
    to its root "shining". \| *Kāmaseṭṭha* means "Chief of
    Sex", i.e. "Eros"; he does not seem to appear in a Brahmanical
    context.

[^710]: Panāda ("roarer") was the name of an ancient king
    who performed the horse sacrifice ([Thag
    2.22:1.1](https://suttacentral.net/thag2.22/en/sujato#1.1), [DN
    26:26.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn26/en/sujato#26.1)). In [Ja
    265](https://suttacentral.net/ja265/en/sujato) he is said to have
    been the son of Vessavaṇa (Kuvera). \|
    Opamañña is a descendant of the ascended sage Upamanyu
    ("zealous one"; see note on [MN
    99:10.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn99/en/sujato#10.3)).

[^711]: Mātali is the charioteer of Sakka (i.e. Indra; [SN
    11.6:1.5](https://suttacentral.net/sn11.6/en/sujato#1.5), [MN
    83:14.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn83/en/sujato#14.1), etc.), a
    role he plays throughout Brahmanical literature as well. He appears
    here as one of the centaur lords, and is father to the centaur
    Sikhaṇḍī, Pañcasikha's rival in love [DN
    21:1.6.8](https://suttacentral.net/dn21/en/sujato#1.6.8).

[^712]: The *gandharva* Citrasena ("Brightspear") appears in the
    Sanskrit Purāṇas as a friend of Arjuna in various
    adventures.

[^713]: *Nala* means "reed". There was a King Nala of Vidarbha whose
    love for his Queen Damayantī is celebrated in the
    Mahābharata. \| Janesabha is an alternate spelling of
    Janavasabha ([DN 18](https://suttacentral.net/dn18/en/sujato)).

[^714]: In [DN 21](https://suttacentral.net/dn21/en/sujato) we shall
    learn of how the centaur Pañcasikha ("Fivecrest") wooed
    Timbaru's daughter Suriyavaccasā ("Sunshine").

[^715]: Read *nābhasa*, which means "celestial, heavenly".
    The commentary says this was the name of a lake, which agrees with
    the legend that a Nābhasa was a son of Nala ("reed")
    and father of Puṇḍarīka ("lotus"). The Sanskrit here,
    however, has *sahabhuṁ nāgo*.

[^716]: *Vesālā* is from the adjectival form
    *vesāla* ("of Vesālī"). \| Pali *taccha*
    can represent Sanskrit *takṣa*, and the Sanskrit does
    indeed have *takṣakaḥ* here, so Tacchaka is probably
    "of Takṣasilā". This famous city, normally spelled
    Takkasilā in Pali, is Taxila in West Pakistan, an
    ancient center of learning.

[^717]: These *nāgas* are frequently mentioned together in
    Sanskrit literature such as the Mahābhārata (1.31.1a,
    2.9.9a, 5.101.9c), where they are also said to come from
    Pāyāga (3.83.72a: *prayāgaṁ
    sapratiṣṭhānaṁ kambalāśvatarau*).

[^718]: Payāga (modern Prayagraj, formerly Allahabad) is
    the sacred ford at the confluence of the Ganges and the
    Yamunā beside Kosambī (see [Bu Pj
    1:4.18](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/sujato#4.18)).

[^719]: The Dhataraṭṭha and Erāvaṇa
    *nāgas* also appear frequently in Sanskrit literature,
    and often in association with other deities in our text as part of a
    loose cluster of divinities (eg. Harivamśa 3.112--117).
    Erāvaṇa also appears at [Snp
    2.14:5.1](https://suttacentral.net/snp2.14/en/sujato#5.1). Here he
    is a *nāga* as in "dragon", but later tradition saw him
    as a *nāga* as in "elephant", in which role he became
    the mighty mount of Indra/Sakka.

[^720]: Here we see the eternal mythic struggle between birds and
    snakes, the creatures of the sky and the underworld.

[^721]: Birds are called "twice-born", once from the mother, once from
    the egg. "Twice-born" is also an epithet of brahmins ([Thig
    15.1:31.3](https://suttacentral.net/thig15.1/en/sujato#31.3)).

[^722]: The *supaṇṇā* (Sanskrit *suparṇa*,
    "brightwing") or *garuḷā* (Sanskrit
    *garuḍā*, "devourer") is the great eagle, king of
    birds, and later the vehicle of Viṣṇu. He has been
    falsely compared with the loathsome harpy; but his golden wings,
    closeness to the sun, and role as bearer of the nectar of
    immortality show that he is the Indian phoenix, the golden eagle of
    the sun. Unlike the western phoenix, he is not said to combust
    himself and be reborn anew. However this motif is merely the surface
    expression of the sun's fiery immortality. As the brother of the
    Dawn (Aruṇa), his golden wings at sunset "devour" the
    sun, and he disappears only to be reborn the next day.

[^723]: The Buddha reconciles even such inveterate enemies. In the
    Buddhist view, all of these beings have their place in the great
    pattern of nature.

[^724]: *Vajirahattha* ("thunderbolt-in-hand") is a synonym of
    *vajirapāṇi* ([DN
    3:1.21.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato#1.21.3), [MN
    35:14.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn35/en/sujato#14.1)). It is a
    frequent epithet of Sakka in the Vedas (eg. Rig Veda 1.173.10a
    *indro vajrahastaḥ*), an identification confirmed by the commentary
    here.

[^725]: Vāsava is another epithet of Sakka (see below, [DN
    20:14.9](https://suttacentral.net/dn20/en/sujato#14.9)), meaning
    "endowed with wealth" (*vasu*; see for example Rig Veda 1.9.9a
    *indraṁ vasupatiṁ* "Indra, lord of
    wealth"). The Buddhist explanation of his name [SN
    11.13:9.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn11.13/en/sujato#9.1), rather,
    plays on the word *āvasatha* and calls him the "giver
    of a guesthouse". Later Brahmanical texts enumerated eight Vasus,
    with Indra as their lord, who are reckoned among the thirty-three.
    \| Sakka's wife is the demon (*asura*) princess Sujā,
    daughter of Vepacitti, hence they are his "brothers", technically
    in-laws ([SN
    11.12:6.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn11.12/en/sujato#6.1)).

[^726]: The Kālakañja ("Blue-lotus") is said to be the
    lowest class of demons ([DN
    24:1.7.19](https://suttacentral.net/dn24/en/sujato#1.7.19)).

[^727]: The Dānavas are a prominent group of *asuras*
    otherwise unattested in early Pali. The name stems from "rivers,
    waters" after their mother Danū. \| Ghasa ("devourer")
    is occasionally mentioned as the name of a *rakṣasa*
    (Rāmāyaṇa 5.22.36a *praghasā
    nāma rākṣasī*). The commentary treats them
    as a single class of arrow-wielding *asuras*.

[^728]: Vepacitti means "wise thinker", Sucitti means "good thinker".
    Vepacitti was the lord of the *asuras* and Sakka's counterpart.
    Their relationship was complicated ([SN
    11.23](https://suttacentral.net/sn11.23/en/sujato)). Brahmanical
    literature regards him as the eldest son of Danū and
    hence chief of the Dānavas. The Sanskrit form is
    *vipracitti*, but in Buddhist texts it is incorrectly Sanskritized
    to *vemacitra*. Vepacitti's fame matches Sucitti's obscurity, for he
    does not seem to appear elsewhere.

[^729]: Pahārāda the ocean-loving *asura* lord appears in
    [AN 8.19](https://suttacentral.net/an8.19/en/sujato). His name
    (Sanskrit *prahlāda*) means "mirth". Later Brahmanical
    legends say he was a righteous son of the wicked
    Hiraṇyakaśipu, who hated him for his devotion to
    Viṣṇu. \| The story goes that when Namuci stole the
    soma from Indra, Indra's vengeance was frustrated by his vow not to
    harm him with anything wet or dry, in the dark or the light
    (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 12.7.3.1). Indra's ingenious
    solution was to dismember him with foam (Rig Veda 8.14.13) at dawn.
    Namuci's name is explained as *na-muci*, "not letting go" (the
    waters). In Buddhism, Namuci is a name of Māra,
    although here Māra appears separately below..

[^730]: According to legend, Bali was the grandson of
    Pahārāda and son of Virocana. His hundred sons were
    dread warriors (Bhāgavata Purāṇa 8.10.30).
    The word *bali* also refers to a kind of sacrificial offering, but
    the roots of the term are obscure.

[^731]: *Virocana* was their grandfather. He was another adversary of
    Indra, despite which they were both said to have sought knowledge
    from Prajāpatī, but Virocana misunderstood since he saw
    only the surface meaning (Chāndogya
    Upaniṣad 8.7.2--8.5). Here he is associated with
    Rāhu, while Gaṇeśa Purāṇa
    2.29 says he was granted a crown by the sun which he then lost.
    These details hint at a connection with the eclipse, in which case
    *virocana* would be the rays that emanate during a solar eclipse.

[^732]: Rāhu is the mighty *asura* who "seizes" the moon
    ([SN 2.9](https://suttacentral.net/sn2.9/en/sujato)) or the sun ([SN
    2.10](https://suttacentral.net/sn2.10/en/sujato)) to create an
    eclipse. He is the son of Vepacitti.

[^733]: These four are normally treated in the suttas as physical
    properties. Each of them is worshiped in the Rig Veda as a deity,
    and the Upanishads list them together along with other elements (eg.
    Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.5). I am not
    aware of any earlier contexts that group the four together
    systematically as deities in this way.

[^734]: Varuṇa is invoked frequently in the Vedas, and in
    the suttas he is associated with other leading deities such as Indra
    and Soma ([DN
    13:25.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn13/en/sujato#25.2), [DN
    32:10.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn32/en/sujato#10.2), [SN
    11.3:5.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn11.3/en/sujato#5.1)). As one of
    the twelve children of Aditi he stood for a calendar month, and grew
    a wide and sometimes baffling array of associations---the oceans,
    water, the sky (at night), and justice. Vedic Varuṇa
    was the god of command, the king of tough rule. He was identified
    with the aristocrats, while his partner Mitra was the brahmins
    (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 4.1.4).

[^735]: *Soma* is the divine nectar that filled the ancient
    proto-Indo-Europeans with vitality. Its biological identity is
    disputed, but may have been ephedra. It is associated with the moon,
    hence the connection with Varuṇa as the night sky. \|
    *Yasa* means "fame, glory"; so far as I know it is not personified
    in early Brahmanical texts, and rarely later. The connection between
    these two is illuminated by such passages as Rig Veda 7.85.3. To
    uphold Indra and Varuṇa in battle, there is an offering
    of Soma, which is described as *svayaśasaḥ*,
    "Self-Glorious", i.e. the state of being high on speed, if speed
    were a god.

[^736]: In the Vedas, Mitra ("friend") is almost always paired with
    Varuṇa, and the appearance of Mettā
    ("friendliness") here echoes that closeness. He was the god of
    alliances. \| *Karuṇā* in the sense of "compassion"
    does not occur at all in pre-Buddhist Sanskrit. It is probably
    introduced here as companion to Mettā by association
    with Mitra. The Sanskrit here, however, is *maitrī
    varuṇikā*. From a Buddhist point of view, these are
    deities reborn due to the development of *jhāna* based
    on love and compassion.

[^737]: Veṇhu (variant *veṇḍu*) is the Pali
    spelling of Sanskrit *viṣṇu*, who appears only here and
    at [SN 2.12](https://suttacentral.net/sn2.12/en/sujato). In the Rig
    Veda he was a solar god who made three great strides (said to
    encompass the earth, the sky, and the heavens). \| A deity named
    Sahalī ("with plow") appears at [SN
    2.30:3.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn2.30/en/sujato#3.1) where he
    praises Makkhali Gosāla, but I cannot trace him
    anywhere else.

[^738]: *Yama* often refers to a god who guards the paths to the land of
    the dead ([SN
    1.33:10.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn1.33/en/sujato#10.3), [MN
    130:5.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn130/en/sujato#5.1)), lord of the
    Yāma gods. Here, however, it refers to "twins" who in
    the Vedas are often identified with the Aśvins (the
    twin horses yoked to the chariot). In the Vedas, it seems *asama*
    ("unequalled") is used as an epithet only, although the commentary
    says it is a name. \| In Pali these lines lack a verb, while the
    Sanskrit supplies *āgataś* ("come") instead of
    *asamā*, so perhaps we should read "the pair of Twins
    came".

[^739]: Vāsava is above at [DN
    20:12.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn20/en/sujato#12.3).

[^740]: *Purandara* ("Fortbreaker") is another epithet of Sakka or Indra
    (eg. Rig Veda 1.102.7). The Buddha reforms it to *Purindada*
    ("Firstgiver") at [SN
    11.12:2.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn11.12/en/sujato#2.1). But
    Indra's generosity is long renowned, eg. Rig Veda 1.10.6c: "He is
    the able one, and he will be able for us---Indra who distributes the
    goods" (*sa śakra uta naḥ śakad indro vasu
    dayamānaḥ*).

[^741]: Sanskrit has *sabhikā*. Most of the deities in the
    following verses do not seem to be met with elsewhere. The Sanskrit
    forms are often quite different but equally untraceable.

[^742]: Their names might mean "Unhurt" and "Hurter". The Sanskrit
    implausibly has *romā* ("Romans").

[^743]: For Varuṇa see above ([DN
    20:13.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn20/en/sujato#13.3)). \|
    Sahadhamma means "who share the same duty".

[^744]: The "Unfallen" and the "Unshakeable".

[^745]: The Sūleyyas might be "spear (or trident) bearers";
    *śūli* is a name of Shiva. \| Rucira means "brilliant,
    beautiful".

[^746]: *Vāsavanesi* means "seekers of
    Vāsava".

[^747]: "Equals" and "Great Equals".

[^748]: "Humans" and "Superhumans", but here perhaps "Descendants of
    Manu".

[^749]: As per [DN
    1:2.7.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#2.7.2).

[^750]: [DN 12.10.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn12.10.2/en/sujato).

[^751]: *Hari* means "yellow, green" and is the astrological color of
    the planet *budha* ("Mercury"). It came to have the general meaning
    of "sacred, holy" and was an epithet for various deities, which in
    the Rig Veda included Indra and Vishnu. However the astrological
    connection is suggested by the references to Mars and Venus below.

[^752]: "Dwellers in the Red Place (= planet)", i.e. "Martians".

[^753]: *Pāraga* means "one who has crossed over".

[^754]: The deities seem to represent the three main lights that
    announce a new day: the morning star, the newborn sun, and the aura
    of the dawn. \| *Sukka* ("Bright") is the name of the planet Venus,
    the morning star. \| *Aruṇa* is the dawn, a major Vedic
    deity signifying the arising of consciousness and order. \|
    *Karambha* means "porridge", which was offered to the sun under the
    name Pūṣan (Rig Veda 3.52.7, 6.56.1; Śatapatha
    Brāhmaṇa 4.2.5.22; Kauṣītaki
    Brāhmaṇa 6.8.18; Maitrāyaṇī
    Saṁhitā 3.10.6). Hence he became known as
    *karambhād*, "porridge-eater". Apparently the sun lost
    its teeth and could only eat porridge (Śatapatha
    Brāhmaṇa 1.7.4.8). Being toothless like a baby, and
    lacking the risen sun's "teeth" (i.e. "rays"), he probably
    represents the "newborn sun". Compare for example Rig Veda 10.35,
    where Pūṣan is invoked, along with many other deities,
    in a hymn to the dawn.

[^755]: Mahāsaṅgīti has *veghanasā*, for which
    the Buddha Jayanthi variant *vekhanasa* is preferable. We meet a
    wanderer of that name in [MN
    80](https://suttacentral.net/mn80/en/sujato), and in Sanskrit
    *vaikhānasa* is a general term for ascetics; but this
    meaning seems unlikely in context. The astrologer
    Varāhamitra names it a constellation
    (Bṛhat-saṁhitā 47.62), but that is much
    later. The Sanskrit here is *nīlakavāsinī* ("Dwellers
    in the Blue"), which pairs well with *lohitavāsino*
    above. *Nīlavāsa* is a name for Saturn, whose color is
    blue.

[^756]: *Odātagayha* is probably "white planet", i.e. the
    sun. Sanskrit has *avadātakeśā* ("white-haired").
    Compare the description of solar gods Sūrya at Rig Veda
    1.50.8 as *śociṣkeśaṁ vicakṣaṇa*
    ("flame-haired, brilliant") and Varuṇa at Rig Veda
    8.41.9 as *śvetā vicakṣaṇā* ("white,
    brilliant").

[^757]: Sanskrit has *pītakavāsinī*, "dwellers in the
    yellow", either Mercury or Jupiter.

[^758]: The *sadāmatta* ("everdrunk") gods appear in some
    later Buddhist texts, alongside the *māyādharas* (or
    *mālādharas*), but they don't seem to appear in a Vedic
    context. \| I cannot find any reference to the
    *hāragaja* gods. Sanskrit has *hāritakā*,
    perhaps "sons of Harītī" (the *yakkhinī*;
    but see below, [DN
    20:20.12](https://suttacentral.net/dn20/en/sujato#20.12)).

[^759]: "Assorted" is *missaka*, not elsewhere attested as a name of
    gods.

[^760]: Pajjuna (Sanskrit *parjanya*) is a Vedic god of thunderstorms
    closely associated with Indra/Sakka. His daughters appear in [SN
    1.39](https://suttacentral.net/sn1.39/en/sujato) and [SN
    1.40](https://suttacentral.net/sn1.40/en/sujato). Sanskrit has
    instead *śuddhakā rucikā* ("pure,
    bright").

[^761]: The gods of Tusita and Yama are normal parts of the Buddhist
    cosmology. Neither *khemiya* nor the Sanskrit *kṣemaka*
    appear to be the names of gods elsewhere, and the commentary
    explains that they dwell in both the Tusita and Yama realms.

[^762]: The commentary acknowledges the variant readings
    *kaṭṭhakā* (from "stick" or "plowed") and
    *kathakā* ("reciters"), while Sanskrit has
    *kṛṣṇuktāś* ("reciters of the black"). Perhaps related
    to Sanskrit *kāṭhaka*, a recension of the Black Yajur
    Veda taught by the sage Kaṭha.

[^763]: Perhaps from *lamba* ("hang, droop") in reference to deities of
    the sunset (cp. Mahābhārata 4.31.4c *sūrye
    vilambati*). Sanskrit has *lumbinī
    lumbinīśreṣṭhā*, which is perhaps normalized to mean
    "of Lumbinī".

[^764]: "Shining" (*joti*) is used widely of many gods, including the
    Sun and Indra. \| The commentary derives *āsavā* from
    *āsa* ("wish") not *āsava* ("defilement"),
    explaining that they achieved their status due to desire
    (*chandavasena*). This agrees with the Sanskrit
    *svāśiṣā* ("well-wish, prayer"), i.e. words of wishing
    or blessing uttered over the sacrifice (see Rig Veda 10.44.5; cp.
    8.44.23). This is a case where using the Pali in a translation would
    be actively misleading.

[^765]: *Pavuṭṭha* ("shed"), from *pavasati* ("stay away"),
    seems to be unique in the Pali in this sense. Commentary glosses
    *vigata*, "disappeared". \| The first part of this verse, according
    to the commentary, addresses the Saṅgha as a group in
    the singular, but I translate in plural for clarity.

[^766]: Subrahmā appears at [SN
    2.17](https://suttacentral.net/sn2.17/en/sujato) and [SN
    6.6](https://suttacentral.net/sn6.6/en/sujato). \| Paramatta appears
    only here in Pali. In Brahmanical texts it is a common term for the
    highest conception of Brahmā as the "supreme soul"
    (*paramātman*) of the cosmos. This term came into
    common usage later, but is found occasionally in earlier texts such
    as Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā 2.9.1.

[^767]: Sanaṅkumāra makes regular guest appearances in the
    suttas ([DN 3](https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato), [DN
    18](https://suttacentral.net/dn18/en/sujato), [DN
    19](https://suttacentral.net/dn19/en/sujato), [DN
    27](https://suttacentral.net/dn27/en/sujato), [SN
    6.11](https://suttacentral.net/sn6.11/en/sujato), [AN
    11.10](https://suttacentral.net/an11.10/en/sujato)). \| Tissa is a
    common name, meaning "born under the star Sirius". Perhaps this is
    the former monk of that name who was reborn in the
    Brahmā realm ([AN
    6.34](https://suttacentral.net/an6.34/en/sujato)).

[^768]: The moniker "Great Brahmā"
    (*mahābrahmā*) is here used of an individual, but
    sometimes it is a class of leading Brahmās.

[^769]: "God Almighty" (*issara*) is a Brahmā god to whom
    the creation of the world is falsely attributed ([DN
    24:2.14.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn24/en/sujato#2.14.3), [MN
    101:22.5](https://suttacentral.net/mn101/en/sujato#22.5), [AN
    3.61:1.6](https://suttacentral.net/an3.61/en/sujato#1.6)).

[^770]: Sanskrit has *hāritī*, the name of the fabled
    *yakkhiṇī* of Madhurā converted by the
    Buddha.

[^771]: This late sutta exhibits considerable literary sophistication.
    The A-plot concerns Sakka's rejection of his violent past and
    embrace of the Dhamma, while the B-plot concerns
    Pañcasikkha's more modest growth from a libertine to a
    married man. \| This discourse is quoted by name and a passage
    discussed at [SN 22.4](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.4/en/sujato).
    In addition, the dialogue at [MN
    37](https://suttacentral.net/mn37/en/sujato) picks up directly where
    this leaves off and may be considered a sequel. A Sanskrit parallel
    published by Ernst Waldschmidt in 1979 is available on SuttaCentral
    as [SF 241](https://suttacentral.net/sf241/san/waldschmidt). A
    different discourse of the same name is found at [SN
    35.118](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.118/en/sujato).

[^772]: Rhys Davids follows the commentary in translating this "the cave
    of Indra's Sāl Tree". However the Sanskrit
    *yāvacchailaguhāyām* supports "hill cave".

[^773]: Introduced in a minor role in [DN
    18](https://suttacentral.net/dn18/en/sujato), [DN
    19](https://suttacentral.net/dn19/en/sujato), and [DN
    20](https://suttacentral.net/dn20/en/sujato),
    Pañcasikha gets his moment to shine in this sutta.
    Outside of the Dīghanikāya, he appears only in [SN
    35.119](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.119/en/sujato). His name means
    "Fivecrest", evidently in reference to his impressive hairdo; a
    nymph or group of nymphs bore the synonymous name
    Pañcacūḍā, "Five Topknots". The centaur (*gandhabba*)
    was a wild rogue of music, dancing, and sex. He must be tamed, and
    here this is achieved through the power of love and filial respect.
    A less diplomatic approach is taken in Atharvaveda 4.37.7, where the
    *gandharva* with his "egg-crest" (*śikhaṇḍino*) is
    threatened with castration.

[^774]: The "arched harp" (*vīṇa*) was a multi-stringed
    instrument held in the lap, with the strings attached across a
    curved open arch or bow. It is not the modern Indian instrument
    called veena, which is a lute or stick zither. *Gandhabbas* are
    closely associated with music. Māra's harp is described
    in the same way ([SN
    4.23:10.7](https://suttacentral.net/sn4.23/en/sujato#10.7)), and
    tradition says they were in fact the same instrument.

[^775]: In the Buddhist hierarchy of divinity, *gandhabbas* occupy a
    more humble place than the gods of the thirty-three, yet here
    Pañcasikha appears with them in a position of honor. In
    [DN 19:28.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn19/en/sujato#28.3) we saw
    that the even more exalted Brahmā takes the form of
    Pañcasikha. This fluidity is characteristic of old
    Vedic cosmology, where there is no clear hierarchy of divinity. The
    formalized hierarchies in Buddhism and Hinduism are a later
    conception.

[^776]: We will learn later of how Sakka's appearance could be too
    disturbing for the Buddha while on retreat ([DN
    21:1.10.13](https://suttacentral.net/dn21/en/sujato#1.10.13)).
    Pañcasikha, on the other hand, would appear alone,
    without a retinue. Note, however, that on subsequent occasions Sakka
    showed no such reticence, either because he was already a
    stream-enterer or because the Buddha was not in solitary retreat.

[^777]: The idea that the Buddha would be wooed by a love song seems
    like an absurd conceit, until you take into account the centaurs'
    dangerous reputation as inveterate lechers. Pañcasikha
    wants to show that he is maturing and finally seeking a commitment
    in a respectable marriage.

[^778]: Suriyavaccasā ("Sunshine") accords with the Vedic
    conception of the wife as the Sun (Sūryā, Rig Veda
    10.85) who takes as husband Soma, the moon. She appears in
    Atharvaveda 8.10.27, which invokes the *gandharvas* with their
    female counterpart the "nymphs" (Pali *accharā*,
    Sanskrit *āpsarásā*).

[^779]: In Sanskrit literature, Timbaru (Sanskrit *tumburu*) was an
    elder *gandharva* musician in the courts of Indra and Kuvera.
    According to Rāmāyaṇa 3.4, he was cursed with a
    monstrous form by Kuvera due to an inappropriate lust for the nymph
    Rambhā. Upon his defeat at the hands of
    Rāma he was restored to his former status.
    Pañcasikha would have wanted to avoid a similar fate.
    Rather than Suriyavaccasā, the Sanskrit literature
    mentions his daughters Manuvantī and
    Sukeśī (Vāyupurāṇa 69.49 =
    Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa 2.7.13).

[^780]: *Aṅgīrasi* means "shining one" and is
    etymologically linked with *agni* ("fire").
    Suriyavaccasā earned the name due to both her radiant
    nature and her family connections: her father Timbaru was a son of
    Kaśyapa, who was (according to certain lineages)
    brother of Aṅgīras, from whom the
    Aṅgīrasas were descended. In the Arthavaveda---the only
    early non-Buddhist source for a nymph named
    Suriyavaccasā---*aṅgīrasi* is associated
    with witchcraft (Atharvaveda 12.5.52). *Aṅgīrasa* is
    also a patronymic of the Buddha ([DN
    32:3.14](https://suttacentral.net/dn32/en/sujato#3.14)).

[^781]: "Saints" is *arahantā*, which I normally translate
    as "perfected ones".

[^782]: *Parinibbāpaya*, "please quench me".
    Pañcasikha subverts imagery employed by the
    Buddha---quenching thirst, cooling breezes, extinguished flames---to
    erotic effect.

[^783]: Pañcasikha is showing off his literary skill. The
    same image, the elephant, illustrates opposing qualities, peaceful
    and violent. In these two sides of sensual desire, he reveals,
    unconsciously perhaps, the rapacious side of his own nature. For
    Pañcasikha, the elephant bursting its bonds illustrates
    his crazed devotion, whereas later it illustrates breaking free of
    desire ([DN
    21:1.12.45](https://suttacentral.net/dn21/en/sujato#1.12.45)).

[^784]: For how a married couple may stay together in this life and the
    next, see [AN 4.55](https://suttacentral.net/an4.55/en/sujato).

[^785]: Pañcasikha is using the present participle
    *jigīsāno* in the historical present.

[^786]: In Indian culture, a *gandharva* wedding is a pure love-match,
    without the blessing of parents or priests. Here, however,
    Pañcasikha wants to do the right thing and get the
    father's blessing.

[^787]: If Pañcasikha was seeking the Buddha's approval for
    his love-match, he was doomed to disappointment, as the Buddha and
    his mendicants do not involve themselves in arranging marriages. The
    Buddha sidesteps the issue by politely complementing
    Pañcasikha on his musicianship.

[^788]: "When did you compose" is also at [MN
    56:30.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn56/en/sujato#30.1).

[^789]: "Sister" (*bhaginī*) is a respectful term of
    address, but is normally used in a chaste sense. When
    Raṭṭhapāla calls his wives "sister", they faint in
    shock ([MN 82:23.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn82/en/sujato#23.4)).

[^790]: Sikhaṇḍī ("egg-crested") is the term for the
    centaur as seductive threat to women in Atharvaveda 4.37.7. It is
    also a poetic term for a peacock.

[^791]: It is rare for the Buddha to address a deity as "venerable"
    (*āyasmā*), a term usually reserved for monks.
    Moggallāna addresses Sakka as "the venerable Kosiya" at
    [MN 37:10.6](https://suttacentral.net/mn37/en/sujato#10.6);
    Mahākassapa calls him Kosiya without honorific at [Ud
    3.7:3.12](https://suttacentral.net/ud3.7/en/sujato#3.12). \| The
    word *kosiya* is explained by the commentaries as "owl", which, if
    correct, would have been the totem for a clan of that name. It is,
    however, a patronymic: Rig Veda 1.10.11 has *indra
    kauśika* which means "Indra, son of Kuśika
    (or Kuśa)". *Kuśa* grass is critical to
    the performance of Vedic rites, and the label probably initially
    implied "Brahmanized", i.e. a king whose reign was authorized
    according to Vedic ritual. Kosiya is said to be a low class family
    name ([Bu Pc
    2:2.1.18](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2/en/sujato#2.1.18)).

[^792]: A *paricārikā* is a maid attending on a nymph ([MN
    37:8.12](https://suttacentral.net/mn37/en/sujato#8.12)). \|
    Bhūjati (variant *bhuñjatī*) does not seem
    to appear elsewhere.

[^793]: Sakka pointedly ignores this, but perhaps his shame at
    disturbing the Buddha's meditation explains his oblique method of
    gaining an audience.

[^794]: This implies she was a stream-enterer.

[^795]: In Buddhism, sex is mutable between lives and even within one
    life ([Bu Pj
    1:10.6.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/sujato#10.6.1)).
    Later Buddhists sometimes held that the status of a male was
    preferable. Here this is not stated outright, but the narrative
    implies that she thought her station was improved when becoming a
    male. Notably, it is not the Buddha who says this, but Sakka,
    relaying the story of another deity. That the proponent was a woman,
    at least formerly, is a trope of Indian literature: a woman is the
    ideal misogynist (see eg. [Ja
    61](https://suttacentral.net/ja61/en/sujato) or
    Śivapurāna chapter 4). Here, though, the situation is
    nuanced, because despite her (presumed) inferior status, she has
    better rebirth than the monks she served.

[^796]: The realm of centaurs is "inferior" because the centaurs are
    known for their ribald sexuality.

[^797]: *Kutomukhā*, which occurs only in this sutta,
    contrasts with *sammukhā* ("in the presence of", "from
    the mouth of"). The commentary explains it as a rhetorical question,
    "Were you distracted or falling asleep?" Alternatively, it might
    mean "From whom did you learn the Buddha's teaching?" It recurs
    later in the verses. This is not the only such case:
    *duddiṭṭharūpaṁ* and *kāyaṁ
    brahmapurohitaṁ* are other examples of terms found
    nowhere else in the Pali canon, yet found here both in prose and in
    verse. Clearly one has been copied from the other; it seems to me
    that the rarity of these terms and the greater coherence of the
    verses suggests that the prose is a (somewhat altered) summary of
    the verses.

[^798]: The commentary explains the verb "gained"
    (*paṭilabhiṁsu*) as serving dual roles here: "gaining"
    of "absorption mindfulness" (*jhānasatiṁ*), upon which
    they "gain" rebirth in the Brahmā realm. However, the
    verses below speak of "recollecting" (*anussaraṁ*) the
    Buddha's teachings at this juncture. Compare [Bu NP
    23:1.1.20](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np23/en/sujato#1.1.20),
    where the king "remembered" his long-forgotten promise
    (*vissaritvā cirena satiṁ
    paṭilabhitvā*). [AN
    4.191:2.24](https://suttacentral.net/an4.191/en/sujato#2.24) speaks
    of the "arising of memory" (*satuppādo*) in a deity
    when reminded of Dhamma passages they once recited as a monk. \| The
    phrase *kāyaṁ brahmapurohitaṁ* is
    syntactically incongruous; I think it was clumsily copied from the
    verses below, where the required verb (*ajjhagaṁsu*) is
    present. The commentary explains it as "a Minister of
    Brahmā's body" (*brahmapurohitasarīraṁ*),
    but in such contexts *kāya* usually means "host".

[^799]: When bowing, it is a special sign of devotion to touch the feet
    of the one revered (eg. [MN
    89:9.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn89/en/sujato#9.1)).

[^800]: Here Gopaka shifts from speaking about them in third person to
    speaking to them in second person.

[^801]: *Tidiva* is an abbreviated reference to the thirty-three gods.

[^802]: I.e. she was a lay person.

[^803]: Up until now, the verses have been spoken by Gopaka, but here a
    narrator appears.

[^804]: Normally rebirth is described as passing away in one realm then
    being reborn in another. Yet here the gods of the thirty-three---in
    their traditional abode on Mount Meru---were watching them literally
    fly from one realm to another.

[^805]: The truncated *janind'* is not vocative *janinda* for Sakka, but
    nominative *janindo* for the Buddha.

[^806]: "Sakyan Sage" (*sakyamuni*) became a favorite epithet of the
    Buddha, but in early texts it appears only here and the Ratanasutta
    ([Snp 2.1:4.2](https://suttacentral.net/snp2.1/en/sujato#4.2)).

[^807]: "Sons" in a spiritual sense.

[^808]: The commentary says, "In this dispensation the explanation of
    the teaching is such that because of it, disciples become endowed
    with such qualities" (*ettha sāsane
    evarūpā dhammappakāsanā, yāya
    sāvakā etehi guṇehi
    samannāgatā honti*). This explains the feminine
    *etādisī*; *pakasanā*, which is normally
    neuter, is feminine here. This use is fairly common in later texts
    (it occurs at the conclusion of the Ṭīkā for this
    sutta).

[^809]: *Kiṅkaṅkhati* is a unique term for "doubt".

[^810]: The end point of Gopaka's speech is hard to determine, as there
    is no *-ti* to mark it. Various editions and translations either
    ignore the issue or end it in different places. The next line marks
    the beginning of Sakka's direct speech to the Buddha, and I think it
    makes the best sense to assume that up to here he has been relating
    the story he was told.

[^811]: This question hints at Sakka's own evolution from the battlegod
    of the Vedas to an acolyte of peace.

[^812]: Jealousy is wanting what others have, while stinginess is not
    wanting to share what you have.

[^813]: Compare with such contexts as the side branch of dependent
    origination at [DN
    15:9.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn15/en/sujato#9.1), the origins of
    disputes at [Snp 4.11](https://suttacentral.net/snp4.11/en/sujato),
    and the analysis of proliferation at [MN
    18](https://suttacentral.net/mn18/en/sujato). Note the constructive
    use of the "yes, and" method of questioning. Sakka finds wisdom due
    to his curiosity, neither being too-easily sated with a simple
    answer, nor quibbling that the answer is inadequate, but building on
    the foundations of understanding.

[^814]: Compare [Snp
    4.11:4.1](https://suttacentral.net/snp4.11/en/sujato#4.1).

[^815]: Here we depart from the normal sequence, which is that feelings
    give rise to craving (*taṇhā*). In [Snp
    4.11:6.1](https://suttacentral.net/snp4.11/en/sujato#6.1) it is said
    that pleasure and pain give rise to desire, not thought.

[^816]: "Judgments that emerge from the proliferation of perceptions"
    renders *papañcasaññāsaṅkhā*. Again the sequence
    departs from [MN
    18:16.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn18/en/sujato#16.1), which says
    that thoughts---which are normal and morally neutral psychological
    processes---give rise to "proliferation" (*papañca*),
    which is when craving and delusion cause thought to spin out of
    control. "Proliferation" then solidifies into "judgments" that fuel
    an individual's delusion of "self" persisting through time.

[^817]: *Jaññā* is 3rd singular optative (cp. [AN
    9.6:3.4](https://suttacentral.net/an9.6/en/sujato#3.4)).

[^818]: That is, second *jhāna* is better than first
    *jhāna*.

[^819]: Overwhelmingly, the suttas speak of happiness in the path to
    liberation. They do, however, also acknowledge that sometimes
    temporary states of sadness leading to disillusionment can spur a
    person on the path.

[^820]: It is hard to know what the text is getting at here, as there is
    no "sadness" in any *jhāna*.

[^821]: Here the Buddha emphasizes the psychological and spiritual
    underpinnings of the "monastic code" (*pātimokkha*).

[^822]: The suttas frequently describe three kinds of search: for
    sensual pleasures, for continued existence, and for a spiritual path
    (eg. [SN
    45.161:7.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.161/en/sujato#7.3)). The
    last search led the Buddha to awakening ([MN
    26:15.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn26/en/sujato#15.1)).

[^823]: Sakka switches his term of address for the Buddha from
    *mārisa* to the more respectful *bhante* here, then
    back to *mārisa* below. This passage is found at [MN
    114:24.5](https://suttacentral.net/mn114/en/sujato#24.5), where
    *bhante* is used, suggesting it was imported from there.

[^824]: For a more detailed analysis of this, see [MN
    152](https://suttacentral.net/mn152/en/sujato).

[^825]: The Pali *ekanta* ("single") here is a little tricky; it could
    mean either "the same" or "of one goal". The Sanskrit has just *eka*
    (*ekakāmā ekacchandāḥ*, "one desire, one
    wish"), while the commentary explains the first and last terms as
    "one goal" and the middle terms as "one".

[^826]: The Buddha points out that spiritual teachers, when faced with a
    world of experiential diversity, tend to prioritize their own
    experience or doctrine, dismissing others as less real or
    meaningful.

[^827]: This is the final substantive question of the series. It is
    picked up in [MN
    37:2.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn37/en/sujato#2.2) where Sakka, in
    a subsequent visit, inquires further as to the nature of those who
    have realized the ultimate goal.

[^828]: "Turbulence" is *ejā*, from a root meaning "motion,
    agitation", and hence the opposite of the "imperturbable" (*aneja*)
    peace of the Buddha ([SN
    35.90](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.90/en/sujato)).

[^829]: Compare Ajātasattu's experience at [DN
    2:15.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#15.1).

[^830]: "Nectar" is *ojā*, in Vedic texts called *soma* or
    *amṛta* ("ambrosia" of immortality). The battle over
    nectar by gods (*deva*) and demons (*asura*) is a very ancient
    element of Indo-European mythology.

[^831]: Here Sakka makes a clean break from the violent delights he
    enjoyed in former (Vedic) times.

[^832]: *Punarāyu* is a unique term. It probably means that
    Sakka can extend his current fortunate birth due to the merit of
    Dhamma.

[^833]: To die "unconfused" or "consciously" is said to be a benefit of
    Dhamma practice (eg. [AN
    5.215:2.3](https://suttacentral.net/an5.215/en/sujato#2.3)).

[^834]: "According to method" (*ñāyena*) recalls
    *ñāyapaṭipanno* as a description of the noble ones. It
    means practicing according with the noble eightfold path, a "method"
    that yields definite results.

[^835]: This refers to the possibility of achieving perfection
    (*arahattā*).

[^836]: That is, after passing away as Sakka and being reborn as a
    human, he will subsequently return to the heaven realm.

[^837]: He predicts that his final life will be in this high realm that
    is inhabited by non-returners ([AN
    9.12:6.7](https://suttacentral.net/an9.12/en/sujato#6.7)).

[^838]: *Karomasi* is middle imperative 1st plural, "we should do",
    glossed by the commentary as "we should pay homage"
    (*namakkāraṁ karoma*).

[^839]: *Samaṁ* is an indeclinable in the sense "likewise".

[^840]: *Sāmaṁ* is an indeclinable in the sense "oneself,
    personally, one's own".

[^841]: A *gandharva* wedding must be a mutual love match.

[^842]: "Touching the ground with his hand" is a unique gesture in the
    early Pali, immortalized in later legend when the Buddha touches the
    ground to invoke the Earth Goddess as witness of his striving.

[^843]: Sakka is also said to have been accompanied by 80,000 deities at
    [SN 40.10:4.4](https://suttacentral.net/sn40.10/en/sujato#4.4). This
    is one of many indications that this is a late discourse, several of
    which have been touched on above: late or unique terminology; fancy
    literary styles; adoption of doctrinal passages from elsewhere in a
    sometimes clumsy fashion; and so on. In determining whether a sutta
    is late or early, we do not rely on a single definitive reason, but
    on a cluster of independent criteria which taken together are most
    easily explained in terms of historical development.

[^844]: This discourse is copied from [MN
    10](https://suttacentral.net/mn10/en/sujato). The section on the
    four noble truths has been expanded with material mostly drawn from
    [MN 141](https://suttacentral.net/mn141/en/sujato). These discourses
    are the most influential texts for modern Theravada meditation,
    prompting countless modern commentaries. Comparative study of the
    several parallel versions reveals that this discourse, while
    comprised almost entirely of early material, was compiled in this
    form as one of the latest texts in the Pali suttas. \| While
    mindfulness is always useful ([SN
    46.53:15.4](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.53/en/sujato#15.4)), the
    "establishment of mindfulness" (*satipaṭṭhāna*) refers
    especially to a conscious development of contemplative practices
    based on mindfulness, i.e. "mindfulness meditation".

[^845]: The phrase *ekāyano maggo* ("path to convergence")
    is given multiple meanings in commentaries and ancient translations.
    Outside of *satipaṭṭhāna*, it is used in only one
    context in Pali, where it means to "come together with" ([MN
    12:37.5](https://suttacentral.net/mn12/en/sujato#37.5)). At [SN
    47.18:3.4](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.18/en/sujato#3.4) the
    phrase is spoken by Brahmā, which suggests it was a
    Brahmanical term. At Bṛhadāraṇyaka
    Upaniṣad 2.4.11---a passage full of details shared with
    the suttas---it means a place where things unite or converge. Thus
    *satipaṭṭhāna* leads to everything "coming together as
    one". In other words, as seventh factor of the noble eightfold path,
    it leads to *samādhi*, the eighth factor ([SN
    45.1:3.9](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.1/en/sujato#3.9); see also
    [MN 44:12.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn44/en/sujato#12.3)).

[^846]: The idiom *kāye kāyānupassī*,
    literally "observes a body in the body" refers to focusing on a
    specific aspect of embodied experience, such as the breath, the
    postures, etc. \| "Keen" (or "ardent", *ātāpī*) implies
    effort, while "aware" (*sampajāno*) is the wisdom of
    understanding situation and context. \| "Covetousness and
    displeasure" (*abhijjhādomanassaṁ*) are the strong
    forms of desire and aversion that are overcome by sense restraint in
    preparation for meditation.

[^847]: "Feelings" (*vedanā*) are the basic tones of
    pleasant, painful, or neutral, not the complexes we call "emotions".

[^848]: "Mind" (*citta*) is simple awareness. In meditation contexts,
    "mind" is often similar in meaning to *samādhi*.

[^849]: "Principles" (*dhammā*) are the natural "systems"
    of cause and effect that underlie the "teachings". The renderings
    "mind objects" or "mental qualities" are incorrect, as many of the
    things spoken of in this section are neither mind objects nor mental
    qualities. "Phenomena" is a possible translation, but the emphasis
    is not on the "appearance" of things, but on the "principles"
    governing their conditional relations.

[^850]: The context here---a mendicant gone to the forest---establishes
    that this practice takes place in the wider context of the Gradual
    Training. Indeed, this whole sutta can be understood as an expansion
    of this phrase, mentioned briefly at [DN
    2:67.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#67.3).

[^851]: The most fundamental meditation instruction in Buddhism. Notice
    how the Buddha phrases it: not "concentrate on the breath" as an
    object, but rather "breathing" as an activity to which one brings
    mindfulness.

[^852]: The stages of breath meditation are not meant to be done
    deliberately, but to be observed and understood as the natural
    process of deepening meditation. When starting out, the breath is
    somewhat rough and coarse.

[^853]: Over time, the breath becomes more subtle and soft.

[^854]: Contextually the idiom "whole body" (*sabbakāya*)
    here refers to the breath, marking the fuller and more continuous
    awareness that arises with tranquility. Some practitioners, however,
    interpret it as the "whole physical body", broadening awareness to
    encompass the movement and settling of energies throughout the body.

[^855]: The "physical process" (*kāyasaṅkhāraṁ*) is the
    breath ([SN
    41.6:1.8](https://suttacentral.net/sn41.6/en/sujato#1.8)).

[^856]: Text has "long" and "short", but "deep" and "shallow" or "heavy"
    and "light" are more idiomatic for describing the breath in English.

[^857]: "Internally" is one's own body, "externally" the bodies of
    others, or external physical phenomena. This distinction is applied
    broadly in Buddhist meditation, but it is more relevant in some
    contexts than others. In the case of the breath, one is focusing on
    one's own breath, but when contemplating, say, a dead body, or the
    material elements, there is more of an external dimension. Starting
    with "me" in here and the "world" out there, this practice dissolves
    this distinction so that we see we are of the same nature as
    everything else.

[^858]: This is the *vipassanā* ("insight" or
    "discernment") dimension of meditation, observing not just the rise
    and fall of phenomena, but also their conditioned "nature" as being
    "liable" (*-dhamma*) to impermanence. The meaning of this passage is
    explained at ([SN
    47.42](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.42/en/sujato)). Apart from
    these passages, *vipassanā* in
    *satipaṭṭhāna* pertains specially to the observation of
    principles.

[^859]: Mindfulness meditation leads to a range of knowledges as
    detailed by Anuruddha at [SN
    52.6](https://suttacentral.net/sn52.6/en/sujato) and [SN
    52.11](https://suttacentral.net/sn52.11/en/sujato)--24. An arahant
    is "independent" of any attachment (eg. [MN
    143](https://suttacentral.net/mn143/en/sujato)), but
    *satipaṭṭhāna* is also taught to give up dependency on
    views of the past and future ([DN
    29:40.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato#40.1)).

[^860]: In early Pali, this practice is found only in the two
    Satipaṭṭhānasuttas and the closely related
    Kāyagatāsatisutta ([MN
    119](https://suttacentral.net/mn119/en/sujato)). It is practiced by
    developing a reflexive awareness of one's posture and activity as it
    proceeds, often assisted by moving slowly and carefully.

[^861]: "Situational awareness" (*sampajañña*) understands
    the context and purpose of activities. The main examples here
    illustrate the activities of daily monastic life: leaving the
    monastery on almsround, restraint while in the town, care wearing
    the robes, then mindfully eating and going to the toilet.

[^862]: This practice is intended to counter sexual desire and
    obsession. The primary focus is on one's own body, rather than
    another's body, although that can be brought in also. By focusing on
    aspects of our body that we normally prefer to ignore, we move
    towards a healthy sense of acceptance and neutrality towards our
    body.

[^863]: Thirty-one parts are mentioned in early texts, later expanded to
    thirty-two with the addition of the "brain"
    (*matthaluṅga*).

[^864]: The "bag with openings at both ends" is the body. Not all the
    varieties of grains and beans can be positively identified.

[^865]: While meditation on the elements is commonly taught in early
    texts, this phrase is found only in the two
    Satipaṭṭhānasuttas and the
    Kāyagatāsatisutta. Detailed instructions are found in
    such suttas as [MN 28](https://suttacentral.net/mn28/en/sujato) and
    [MN 140](https://suttacentral.net/mn140/en/sujato). This meditation
    works in any posture, whereas breath meditation is best done
    sitting, to allow the breath to become still.

[^866]: The "elements" are the four states of matter as represented by
    their primary material example and their dominant property: earth as
    a solid with the property of resisting or upholding; water as a
    liquid with the property of binding; air as a gas with the property
    of movement; and fire ("heat" or "energy") as plasma with the
    property of transformation.

[^867]: This gruesome image shows that butchery of cows was a normal
    feature of ancient Indian life.

[^868]: Cremation was expensive and not available to everyone. Bodies
    might be left in the charnel ground for a variety of reasons, such
    as local customs, lack of funds, or in cases of inauspicious death
    such as murder or execution. This is still seen in some places
    today, and monastics occasionally take the opportunity to practice
    meditation beside a corpse. However the wording of the Pali sounds
    like an imaginative exercise.

[^869]: The observed corpse is not gendered. The purpose is not to
    become repulsed by an objectified other, but to understand the
    mortality of one's own body.

[^870]: It takes decades for bones to rot to powder, again suggesting it
    is an imaginative contemplation.

[^871]: Literally "a feeling among the feelings"; the practice shows
    that the meditator contemplates specific feelings as they occur.

[^872]: Pali employs direct quotes to indicate reflexive awareness: you
    feel the feeling and you know that you feel the feeling. It does not
    mean that you have to literally say "I feel a pleasant feeling",
    although some adopt that as a meditation method.

[^873]: Feelings "of the flesh" (*sāmisa*) are associated
    with the body and sensual desires ([SN
    36.31:4.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn36.31/en/sujato#4.1)).

[^874]: Feelings "not of the flesh" (*nirāmisa*) are
    associated with renunciation and especially with the
    *jhānas* and liberation ([SN
    36.31:5.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn36.31/en/sujato#5.1)).

[^875]: This would include the feelings of loss, doubt, and dejection
    that can occur during the spiritual path (see [MN
    44:28.6](https://suttacentral.net/mn44/en/sujato#28.6)).

[^876]: The feeling of the fourth *jhāna* and higher
    liberations ([SN
    36.31:8.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn36.31/en/sujato#8.2)).

[^877]: In Buddhist theory, awareness of the presence or absence of
    qualities such as greed is explained on three levels. There is the
    simple happenstance of whether greed is present at that time or not.
    Then there is the mind freed of greed through the power of
    absorption. Finally there is the liberation from greed which comes
    with full awakening.

[^878]: The mind is "constricted internally" due to dullness and
    "scattered externally" due to the distractions of desire ([SN
    51.20:18.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn51.20/en/sujato#18.1)).

[^879]: The following terms "expansive" (*mahaggata*), "supreme"
    (*anuttara*), "immersed" (*samāhita*), and "freed"
    (*vimutta*) all refer to states of absorption and/or awakening.

[^880]: The Satipaṭṭhānavibhaṅga of the Pali Abhidhamma
    only mentions the hindrances and awakening factors in this section
    ([Vb 7](https://suttacentral.net/vb7)). This, together with a range
    of other evidence, suggests that this was the original content of
    the observation of principles.

[^881]: Here causality is introduced. In the contemplation of mind, the
    meditator was aware of the presence or absence of desire in the
    mind. Now they look deeper, investigating the cause of desire and
    understanding how to be free of it forever. This contemplation of
    the "principles" of cause and effect is the distinctive feature of
    this section.

[^882]: The Buddhist schools debated whether this included physical
    tiredness or not. The Theravada argued that it was purely a mental
    laziness, as even the Buddha got sleepy.

[^883]: "Form" (*rūpa*) is one's own body and the external
    material world experienced through the senses. More subtly, it
    represents the "appearance" of physical phenomena, even when
    experienced solely in the mind as color, visions, etc.

[^884]: "Perception" (*saññā*) is the recognition or
    interpretation of experience in terms of meaningful wholes. We see,
    for example, "color" yet we perceive a "person". In the Vinaya we
    find many examples where a person perceived things in one way, yet
    they turned out to be something else.

[^885]: In the five aggregates, *saṅkhārā* is a synonym for
    "volition" (*cetanā*). The traditions later used it as
    a catch-all category for everything that does not fit in the other
    aggregates. In the suttas, however, the purpose of the aggregates is
    not to classify everything that exists, but to contemplate aspects
    of experience that we tend to identify as a "self".

[^886]: At [SN
    35.232:3.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.232/en/sujato#3.2) the
    "fetter that arises dependent on both" is identified as "desire and
    lust" (*chandarāga*).

[^887]: These seven factors that lead to awakening
    (*bojjhaṅgā*, [SN
    46.5](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.5/en/sujato)) are commonly
    presented in opposition to the five hindrances (eg. [SN
    46.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.2/en/sujato), [SN
    46.23](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.23/en/sujato), [SN
    46.55](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.55/en/sujato)).

[^888]: "Mindfulness" includes the recollection of the teachings ([SN
    46.3:1.8](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.3/en/sujato#1.8)) as well as
    mindfulness meditation.

[^889]: Likewise, this includes the inquiry into *dhammas* as
    "teachings" as well as "phenomena" or "principles".

[^890]: Due to their development of the two wings of *samatha* and
    *vipassanā* meditation as described in this sutta,
    practised in the context of the teaching and training as a whole,
    the meditator realizes the four noble truths at the moment of
    stream-entry.

[^891]: The sutta now proceeds in analytical fashion, digging deeper
    into the details of the four noble truths. The fundamental
    definitions were taught in the Buddha's first sermon ([SN
    56.11:4.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11/en/sujato#4.1)).

[^892]: As at [DN 15.4.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn15.4.3/en/sujato),
    *jāti* is invariably defined as the rebirth of beings,
    not as simple arising. The same applies to old age and death.

[^893]: In this and following definitions we mainly find mere verbal
    variations of the basic term.

[^894]: *Dukkha* ("pain", "suffering") is here restricted to physical
    pain. Elsewhere it may be any kind of painful feeling, while in the
    four noble truths it is suffering of any sort, including subtle
    forms of existential suffering.

[^895]: *Domanassa* normally means "sadness", but sometimes it contrasts
    with desire, in which case it is a form of aversion.

[^896]: *Piya* often refers to those who are dear and beloved, but as
    shown here it can also mean simply anything that is liked.

[^897]: This is an example of "painful feeling not of the flesh". The
    Buddha is here denying the efficacy of prayer, invocation, or magic
    spells.

[^898]: The following list of properties that relate to the senses
    gradually moves from the more basic to the more sophisticated.

[^899]: "Eye consciousness" is aware only of "light"; it sees colors but
    does not interpret them.

[^900]: "Contact" or "stimulus" happens when the sense base, the sense
    object, and the sense consciousness all occur together.

[^901]: "Perception" interprets the "light" that is seen, organizing it
    in meaningful wholes. For example, the eye sees the color white,
    while perception recognizes that it is "white", and further, that
    that white color is in fact a "wall".

[^902]: To continue the example, once the light has been interpreted by
    perception as a "wall", we then make the choice to walk around it
    rather than through it. Choices therefore depend on perceptions.

[^903]: "Thought" is *vitakka*.

[^904]: "Consideration" is *vicāra*, a more sustained
    exercize of thought.

[^905]: Mindfulness is not a path in and of itself, but rather is the
    seventh factor of the eightfold path.

[^906]: The fourth noble truth is the path, while the first path factor
    is the noble truths. These two teachings are different perspectives
    on the same *dhamma*.

[^907]: *Saṅkappa* is normally a synonym of *vitakka* in
    the suttas, hence the rendering "right thought". It is, however, not
    just verbalized thought, but the direction in which one applies the
    mind. This factor is the emotional counterpart of right view,
    ensuring that the path is motivated by love and compassion.

[^908]: The first three of the five precepts. "Sexual misconduct" is the
    betrayal of trust in a sexual relationship.

[^909]: Defined for a monastic in the long section on ethics in the
    Sāmaññaphalasutta ([DN
    2:56.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#56.1)) and for a lay
    person as trade in weapons, living creatures, meat, intoxicants, and
    poisons ([AN
    5.177:1.3](https://suttacentral.net/an5.177/en/sujato#1.3)).

[^910]: The emphasis is on "develop in this way" (*evaṁ
    bhāveyya*), that is, with the full practice including
    deep absorption as the culmination of the path as a whole.

[^911]: A similar promise of results in at most seven years is found at
    [DN 25:22.9](https://suttacentral.net/dn25/en/sujato#22.9), [MN
    10:46.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn10/en/sujato#46.3), and [MN
    85:59.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn85/en/sujato#59.3); and at most
    ten years at [AN
    10.46:7.3](https://suttacentral.net/an10.46/en/sujato#7.3).

[^912]: Kumārakassapa was ordained at twenty ([Kd
    1:75.1.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#75.1.1)). He
    features in the Vammikasutta ([MN
    23](https://suttacentral.net/mn23/en/sujato)), and his verses are
    collected in the Theragāthā ([Thag
    2.41](https://suttacentral.net/thag2.41/en/sujato)). He was declared
    the foremost of those with brilliant speech ([AN
    1.217](https://suttacentral.net/an1.217/en/sujato)), apparently on
    the basis of this discourse. \| The Pāyāsisuta is the
    only major Buddhist text that has a Jain parallel,
    Paesi-kahāṇayaṁ, a similar dialogue between Paesi and
    Keśin in Setavyā.

[^913]: Setavyā was north-east of Sāvatthī.

[^914]: Pāyāsi was a *khattiya* yet he receives a
    *brahmadeyya*. The sense of *brahmadeyya* as a donation to brahmins
    is well attested in inscriptions, so I think this is likely a
    mistake in the text, rather than evidence that the practice was not
    for brahmins only.

[^915]: This is wrong view per [MN
    117:5.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn117/en/sujato#5.1).

[^916]: This idiom recurs at [AN
    6.38:1.5](https://suttacentral.net/an6.38/en/sujato#1.5) where, as
    here, it refers to a well-known view and cannot mean that they have
    never heard of it. There the text and commentary read
    *māhaṁ*, which with the aorist is prohibitive not
    negatory. It is an idiom expressing dislike.

[^917]: While the world "down here" is bogged down in its messy and
    ephemeral issues, the heavenly bodies proceed in their serene,
    glorious, stately indifference. Ignoring gravity, self-luminous, and
    apparently eternal, they operate according to what appears to be an
    entirely different set of rules, a "meta-physics". What Newton did
    in physics the Buddha did in spirituality: show that the heavens,
    despite appearances, operate with the same set of conditioned rules
    as apply down here.

[^918]: Kassapa's argument here doesn't directly establish his
    conclusion. It is possible that gods exist on an entirely separate
    plane that has nothing to do with kamma and rebirth.

[^919]: This is still a major factor in shaping belief. People will
    reject the opinions of experts and believe people that they know.

[^920]: Compare Jaiminīya Brāhmaņa 1.42, where
    Varuṇa asphyxiated his son Bhṛgu in order
    to send him on a journey to the "other world", inducing a near-death
    experience. Bhṛgu saw men cutting other men to pieces
    and eating them, and other sights both horrifying and beautiful, all
    the while wondering if what he saw was real, before his breath was
    returned to him.

[^921]: Follow PTS reading *uddassetvā*, which at [MN
    82:11.9](https://suttacentral.net/mn82/en/sujato#11.9) has the sense
    "visit".

[^922]: Kassapa, however, has not established the existence of an
    afterlife, he has merely refuted Pāyāsi's argument. Per
    Occam's razor, the burden of proof lies on the one who wishes to
    establish the existence of the afterlife, not on the one who denies
    it. His arguments, however, become more persuasive if they are
    understood as building on the initial agreement on the divinity of
    the sun and moon. He knows that Pāyāsi accepts some
    form of other world, even if he says otherwise, so the argument
    hinges on whether Pāyāsi's methods are sufficient to
    *disprove* the kind of other world that Kassapa proposes, i.e. one
    driven by kamma.

[^923]: Follow PTS reading *ubbāhati*. Cf. [AN
    3.93:6.4](https://suttacentral.net/an3.93/en/sujato#6.4) for the
    sense "transport".

[^924]: 36,000,000 years.

[^925]: This recognizes the relativity of time.

[^926]: Pāyāsi makes a good point; he only relies on
    sources that he knows he can trust.

[^927]: Kassapa establishes the empirical method by which these truths
    are known. Science extends knowledge by means of external
    instruments, while meditation extends the scope of consciousness. A
    non-scientist cannot understand how a scientist establishes their
    conclusions, and can only rely on trust in the scientific
    establishment. Likewise a non-meditator cannot understand the
    capacity of expanded consciousness.

[^928]: The commentary explains *opabhoggā* ("reward") as
    *pādaparicārikā* ("wife").

[^929]: Read *opāṭesi*.

[^930]: Prefer Mahāsaṅgīti reading *yāva
    vijāyāmi* over PTS *yāva
    jānāmi* ("until I know"); it echoes *yāva
    vijāyāmi* above. The phrase is not fully coherent,
    which is understandable given the circumstances.

[^931]: "Irrationally" is *ayoniso*, literally "not sourcewise". This
    passage gives a nice real world example of what it means: the means
    employed are unrelated to the end sought.

[^932]: Pāyāsi's experiments were cruel, but no more so
    than many recorded in recent history.

[^933]: We assume that a soul must be immaterial and invisible, but
    clearly this was not always the case at the time. From [DN
    1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato) we know that there was an
    almost inexhaustible variety of views about the self or soul.

[^934]: This echoes Upaniṣadic discussions of the nature of
    the dream state and its relation to death. See for example
    Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.1.18, which says
    one might become a brahmin or king in a dream.

[^935]: Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.19
    describes the soul returning to the body like a tired hawk returning
    to the nest.

[^936]: Aside from the cruelty, this echoes the dictum attributed to
    Galileo: "Measure what is measurable, and make measurable what is
    not so." Given sufficient precision, this method could be effective
    in testing for the existence for a physical soul that has mass.

[^937]: A dead body will, if anything, weigh less due to excretion and
    dehydration.

[^938]: The misconception that iron is lighter when heated is repeated
    elsewhere (eg. [SN
    51.22:4.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn51.22/en/sujato#4.1)). In
    fact, assuming there are no chemical reactions, it will be very
    slightly heavier due to relativistic effects, yet less dense and
    hence more buoyant. These changes are too small to be detected by
    Pāyāsi's methods, though.

[^939]: The commentary explains *āmato* as *addhamato*
    ("half-dead").

[^940]: At [AN 9.37](https://suttacentral.net/an9.37/en/sujato) this
    rather abrupt insertion more aptly describes a deep meditation.

[^941]: Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.8 employs
    the same metaphor in the search for the soul.

[^942]: Accept PTS reading *gavesasi*.

[^943]: Pāyāsi honestly acknowledges the role of social
    conformity and shame in shaping views.

[^944]: Although this became the first story of the Jātaka
    collection ([Ja 1](https://suttacentral.net/ja1/en/sujato)), here it
    is not a Jātaka, as it is not framed as a past life of
    the Buddha.

[^945]: While the places are not specified, the journey from "east to
    west" across desolate lands suggests they may have been venturing
    from the rich plains of the Ganges west across the Thar Desert of
    Rajasthan.

[^946]: Read with PTS *gadrabharathena* ("donkey cart") for *bhadrena
    rathena* ("fine cart").

[^947]: The obviously suspicious stranger depicts the genuine dangers of
    trade in unknown regions, warning the traveler of raiding tribes as
    well as supernatural creatures.

[^948]: Again the criteria that only those who are known may be trusted.

[^949]: The ancient Indian game of dice involved casting an handful of
    *vibhītaka* seeds (also known as "bedda nuts", from
    Terminalia bellirica). A number divisible by four was "perfect"
    (*kaṭa*), so the fifth seed meant a "losing" throw
    (*kali*; cf. *apaṇṇaka* in [MN
    60](https://suttacentral.net/mn60/en/sujato) and notes).

[^950]: *Pajohissāmi* is related to Sanskrit *juhoti*,
    usually used in the sense "to offer as libation", a meaning accepted
    by the commentary here. More likely it simply means to "roll out"
    (like pouring a sacrifice) by analogy.

[^951]: *Gāmapaṭṭaṁ* (variants *-padaṁ*,
    *-paddhanaṁ*, *-patthaṁ*,
    *pajjaṁ*) is explained by the commentary as an
    abandoned village site.

[^952]: The sunk cost fallacy.

[^953]: Say what you will about Pāyāsi, he had character.

[^954]: Compare [DN 5:4.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn5/en/sujato#4.5).

[^955]: For *guḷavālakāni*, *guḷa* is "ball",
    *vāla* is "tail"; compare *macchavāḷaka*
    ("fish-tailed") at [Kd
    15:29.4.2](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/sujato#29.4.2).

[^956]: Cp. [AN 5.147](https://suttacentral.net/an5.147/en/sujato), [AN
    9.20](https://suttacentral.net/an9.20/en/sujato).

[^957]: *Divāvihāra* is the "day's meditation", while
    *divāseyya* is "siesta".
