## DN 2 The Fruits of the Ascetic Life *Sāmaññaphalasutta*

### 1. A Discussion With the King's Ministers

[So I have heard.[^150]]{.smallcaps} At one time the Buddha was staying
near Rājagaha in the Mango Grove of Jīvaka
Komārabhacca, together with a large Saṅgha of
1,250 mendicants.[^151]

Now, at that time it was the sabbath---the Komudī full moon
on the fifteenth day of the fourth month---and King
Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, was
sitting upstairs in the royal longhouse surrounded by his
ministers.[^152]

Then Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha,
expressed this heartfelt sentiment,[^153] "Oh, sirs, this moonlit night
is so very delightful, so beautiful, so glorious, so lovely, so
striking.[^154] Now, what ascetic or brahmin might I pay homage to
today, paying homage to whom my mind might find peace?"[^155]

When he had spoken, one of the king's ministers said to him,[^156]
"Sire, Pūraṇa Kassapa leads an order and a community, and
tutors a community. He's a well-known and famous religious founder,
deemed holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he
is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life.[^157] Let
Your Majesty pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will
find peace." But when he had spoken, the king kept silent.[^158]

Another of the king's ministers said to him, "Sire, the bamboo-staffed
ascetic Gosāla leads an order and a community, and tutors a
community. He's a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy
by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced
in years and has reached the final stage of life.[^159] Let Your Majesty
pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace." But
when he had spoken, the king kept silent.

Another of the king's ministers said to him, "Sire, Ajita of the hair
blanket leads an order and a community, and tutors a community. He's a
well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. He
is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has
reached the final stage of life.[^160] Let Your Majesty pay homage to
him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace." But when he had
spoken, the king kept silent.

Another of the king's ministers said to him, "Sire, Pakudha
Kaccāyana leads an order and a community, and tutors a
community. He's a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy
by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced
in years and has reached the final stage of life.[^161] Let Your Majesty
pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace." But
when he had spoken, the king kept silent.

Another of the king's ministers said to him, "Sire, Sañjaya
Belaṭṭhiputta leads an order and a community, and tutors a
community. He's a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy
by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced
in years and has reached the final stage of life.[^162] Let Your Majesty
pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace." But
when he had spoken, the king kept silent.

Another of the king's ministers said to him, "Sire, the Jain ascetic of
the Ñātika clan leads an order and a community, and tutors
a community. He's a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy
by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced
in years and has reached the final stage of life.[^163] Let Your Majesty
pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace." But
when he had spoken, the king kept silent.

### 2. A Discussion With Jīvaka Komārabhacca

Now at that time Jīvaka Komārabhacca was
sitting silently not far from the king.[^164] Then the king said to him,
"But my dear Jīvaka, why are you silent?"

"Sire, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha is
staying in my mango grove together with a large Saṅgha of
1,250 mendicants.[^165] He has this good reputation: 'That Blessed One
is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and
conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to
train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.'[^166] Let Your
Majesty pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find
peace."

"Well then, my dear Jīvaka, have the elephants readied."

"Yes, Your Majesty," replied Jīvaka. He had around five
hundred female elephants readied, in addition to the king's bull
elephant for riding. Then he informed the king, "The elephants are
ready, sire. Please go at your convenience."

Then King Ajātasattu had women mounted on each of the five
hundred female elephants, while he mounted his bull elephant. With
attendants carrying torches, he set out in full royal pomp from
Rājagaha to Jīvaka's mango grove.[^167]

But as he drew near the mango grove, the king became frightened, scared,
his hair standing on end. He said to Jīvaka, "My dear
Jīvaka, I hope you're not deceiving me! I hope you're not
betraying me! I hope you're not turning me over to my enemies! For how
on earth can there be no sound of coughing or clearing throats or any
noise in such a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants?"[^168]

"Do not fear, great king, do not fear! I am not deceiving you, or
betraying you, or turning you over to your enemies. Go forward, great
king, go forward! Those are lamps shining in the pavilion."[^169]

### 3. The Question About the Fruits of the Ascetic Life

Then King Ajātasattu rode on the elephant as far as the
terrain allowed, then descended and approached the pavilion door on
foot, where he asked Jīvaka, "But my dear
Jīvaka, where is the Buddha?"[^170]

"That is the Buddha, great king, that is the Buddha! He's sitting
against the central column facing east, in front of the
Saṅgha of mendicants."

Then the king went up to the Buddha and stood to one side.[^171] He
looked around the Saṅgha of mendicants, who were so very
silent, like a still, clear lake, and expressed this heartfelt
sentiment, "May my son, Prince Udāyibhadda, be blessed with
such peace as the Saṅgha of mendicants now enjoys!"

"Has your mind gone to one you love, great king?"[^172]

"I love my son, sir, Prince Udāyibhadda. May he be blessed
with such peace as the Saṅgha of mendicants now enjoys!"

Then the king bowed to the Buddha, raised his joined palms toward the
Saṅgha, and sat down to one side. He said to the Buddha,
"Sir, I'd like to ask you about a certain point, if you'd take the time
to answer."

"Ask what you wish, great king."

"Sir, there are many different professional fields.[^173] These include
elephant riders, cavalry, charioteers, archers, bannermen, adjutants,
food servers, warrior-chiefs, princes, chargers, great warriors, heroes,
leather-clad soldiers, and sons of bondservants.[^174] They also include
bakers, barbers, bathroom attendants, cooks, garland-makers, dyers,
weavers, basket-makers, potters, accountants, finger-talliers, or those
following any similar professions. All these live off the fruits of
their profession which are apparent in this very life.[^175] With that
they make themselves happy and pleased. They make their parents, their
children and partners, and their friends and colleagues happy and
pleased. And they establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics
and brahmins that's conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads
to heaven.[^176] Sir, can you point out a fruit of the ascetic life
that's likewise apparent in this very life?"[^177]

"Great king, do you recall having asked this question of other ascetics
and brahmins?"[^178]

"I do, sir."

"If you wouldn't mind, great king, tell me how they answered."[^179]

"It's no trouble when someone such as the Blessed One is sitting here."

"Well, speak then, great king."

#### 3.1. The Doctrine of Pūraṇa Kassapa

"This one time, sir, I approached Pūraṇa Kassapa and
exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation
were over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same
question.[^180]

He said to me: 'Great king, the one who acts does nothing wrong when
they punish, mutilate, torture, aggrieve, oppress, intimidate, or when
they encourage others to do the same. They do nothing wrong when they
kill, steal, break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated
buildings, commit highway robbery, commit adultery, and lie. If you were
to reduce all the living creatures of this earth to one heap and mass of
flesh with a razor-edged chakram, no evil comes of that, and no outcome
of evil.[^181] If you were to go along the south bank of the Ganges
killing, mutilating, and torturing, and encouraging others to do the
same, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil. If you were to go
along the north bank of the Ganges giving and sacrificing and
encouraging others to do the same, no merit comes of that, and no
outcome of merit. In giving, self-control, restraint, and truthfulness
there is no merit or outcome of merit.'

And so, when I asked Pūraṇa Kassapa about the fruits of the
ascetic life apparent in the present life, he answered with the doctrine
of inaction.[^182] It was like someone who, when asked about a mango,
answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered
with a mango.[^183] I thought: 'How could one such as I presume to
rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?'[^184] So I neither
approved nor dismissed that statement of Pūraṇa Kassapa. I
was displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting
what he said nor contradicting it, I got up from my seat and left.[^185]

#### 3.2. The Doctrine of the Bamboo-staffed Ascetic Gosāla

This one time, sir, I approached the bamboo-staffed ascetic
Gosāla and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings
and polite conversation were over, I sat down to one side, and asked him
the same question.

He said: 'Great king, there is no cause or reason for the corruption of
sentient beings. Sentient beings are corrupted without cause or
reason.[^186] There's no cause or reason for the purification of
sentient beings. Sentient beings are purified without cause or reason.
One does not act of one's own volition, one does not act of another's
volition, one does not act from a person's volition. There is no power,
no energy, no human strength or vigor.[^187] All sentient beings, all
living creatures, all beings, all souls lack control, power, and energy.
Molded by destiny, circumstance, and nature, they experience pleasure
and pain in the six classes of rebirth.[^188] There are 1.4 million main
wombs, and 6,000, and 600. There are 500 deeds, and five, and three.
There are deeds and half-deeds. There are 62 paths, 62 sub-eons, six
classes of rebirth, and eight stages in a person's life. There are 4,900
Ājīvaka ascetics, 4,900 wanderers, and 4,900 naked
ascetics. There are 2,000 faculties, 3,000 hells, and 36 realms of dust.
There are seven percipient embryos, seven non-percipient embryos, and
seven knotless embryos. There are seven gods, seven humans, and seven
goblins. There are seven lakes, seven rivers, 700 rivers, seven cliffs,
and 700 cliffs. There are seven dreams and 700 dreams. There are 8.4
million great eons through which the foolish and the astute transmigrate
before making an end of suffering.[^189] And here there is no such thing
as this: "By this precept or observance or fervent austerity or
spiritual life I shall force unripened deeds to bear their fruit, or
eliminate old deeds by experiencing their results little by little," for
that cannot be.[^190] Pleasure and pain are allotted. Transmigration
lasts only for a limited period, so there's no increase or decrease, no
getting better or worse. It's like how, when you toss a ball of string,
it rolls away unraveling. In the same way, after transmigrating the
foolish and the astute will make an end of suffering.'

And so, when I asked the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla
about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life, he
answered with the doctrine of purification through transmigration.[^191]
It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a
breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango. I
thought: 'How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or
brahmin living in my realm?' So I neither approved nor dismissed that
statement of the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla. I was
displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what
he said nor contradicting it, I got up from my seat and left.

#### 3.3. The Doctrine of Ajita of the Hair Blanket

This one time, sir, I approached Ajita of the hair blanket and exchanged
greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were
over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question.

He said: 'Great king, there is no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or
offerings. There's no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There's no
afterlife. There's no such thing as mother and father, or beings that
are reborn spontaneously. And there's no ascetic or brahmin who is
rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describes the afterlife
after realizing it with their own insight.[^192] This person is made up
of the four principal states. When they die, the earth in their body
merges and coalesces with the substance of earth. The water in their
body merges and coalesces with the substance of water. The fire in their
body merges and coalesces with the substance of fire. The air in their
body merges and coalesces with the substance of air. The faculties are
transferred to space.[^193] Four men with a bier carry away the corpse.
Their footprints show the way to the cemetery. The bones become
bleached. Offerings dedicated to the gods end in ashes. Giving is a
doctrine of morons. When anyone affirms a positive teaching it's just
hollow, false nonsense. Both the foolish and the astute are annihilated
and destroyed when their body breaks up, and don't exist after death.'

And so, when I asked Ajita of the hair blanket about the fruits of the
ascetic life apparent in the present life, he answered with the doctrine
of annihilationism. It was like someone who, when asked about a mango,
answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered
with a mango. I thought: 'How could one such as I presume to rebuke an
ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?' So I neither approved nor
dismissed that statement of Ajita of the hair blanket. I was displeased,
but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor
contradicting it, I got up from my seat and left.

#### 3.4. The Doctrine of Pakudha Kaccāyana

This one time, sir, I approached Pakudha Kaccāyana and
exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation
were over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question.

He said: 'Great king, these seven substances are not made, not derived,
not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak,
standing firm like a pillar.[^194] They don't move or deteriorate or
obstruct each other. They're unable to cause pleasure, pain, or both
pleasure and pain to each other. What seven? The substances of earth,
water, fire, air; pleasure, pain, and the soul is the seventh.[^195]
These seven substances are not made, not derived, not created, without a
creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar.
They don't move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They're unable to
cause pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain to each other. And here
there is no-one who kills or who makes others kill; no-one who learns or
who educates others; no-one who understands or who helps others
understand.[^196] If you chop off someone's head with a sharp sword, you
don't take anyone's life. The sword simply passes through the gap
between the seven substances.'

And so, when I asked Pakudha Kaccāyana about the fruits of
the ascetic life apparent in the present life, he answered with
something else entirely. It was like someone who, when asked about a
mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit,
answered with a mango. I thought: 'How could one such as I presume to
rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?' So I neither approved
nor dismissed that statement of Pakudha Kaccāyana. I was
displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what
he said nor contradicting it, I got up from my seat and left.

#### 3.5. The Doctrine of the Jain Ascetic of the Ñātika Clan

This one time, sir, I approached the Jain Ñātika and
exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation
were over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question.

He said: 'Great king, consider a Jain ascetic who is restrained in the
fourfold constraint.[^197] And how is a Jain ascetic restrained in the
fourfold constraint? It's when a Jain ascetic is restrained in all that
is to be restrained, is bridled in all that is to be restrained, has
shaken off evil in all that is to be restrained, and is curbed in all
that is to be restrained.[^198] That's how a Jain ascetic is restrained
in the fourfold constraint. When a Jain ascetic is restrained in the
fourfold constraint, they're called a knotless one who is self-realized,
self-controlled, and steadfast.'

And so, when I asked the Jain Ñātika about the fruits of
the ascetic life apparent in the present life, he answered with the
fourfold constraint. It was like someone who, when asked about a mango,
answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered
with a mango. I thought: 'How could one such as I presume to rebuke an
ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?' So I neither approved nor
dismissed that statement of the Jain Ñātika. I was
displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what
he said nor contradicting it, I got up from my seat and left.

#### 3.6. The Doctrine of Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta

This one time, sir, I approached Sañjaya
Belaṭṭhiputta and exchanged greetings with him. When the
greetings and polite conversation were over, I sat down to one side, and
asked him the same question.

He said: 'Suppose you were to ask me whether there is another world. If
I believed that to be the case, I would say so. But I don't say it's
like this. I don't say it's like that. I don't say it's otherwise. I
don't say it's not so. And I don't deny it's not so.[^199] Suppose you
were to ask me whether there is no other world ... whether there both is
and is not another world ... whether there neither is nor is not another
world ... whether there are beings who are reborn spontaneously ...
whether there are no beings who are reborn spontaneously ... whether
there both are and are not beings who are reborn spontaneously ...
whether there neither are nor are not beings who are reborn
spontaneously ... whether there is fruit and result of good and bad
deeds ... whether there is no fruit and result of good and bad deeds ...
whether there both is and is not fruit and result of good and bad deeds
... whether there neither is nor is not fruit and result of good and bad
deeds ... whether a realized one still exists after death ... whether A
realized one no longer exists after death ... whether a realized one
both still exists and no longer exists after death ... whether a
Realized One neither exists nor doesn't exist after death. If I believed
that to be the case, I would say so. But I don't say it's like this. I
don't say it's like that. I don't say it's otherwise. I don't say it's
not so. And I don't deny it's not so.'

And so, when I asked Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta
about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life, he
answered with flip-flopping. It was like someone who, when asked about a
mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit,
answered with a mango. I thought: 'This is the most foolish and stupid
of all these ascetics and brahmins! How on earth can he answer with
flip-flopping when asked about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent
in the present life?' I thought: 'How could one such as I presume to
rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?' So I neither approved
nor dismissed that statement of Sañjaya
Belaṭṭhiputta. I was displeased, but did not express my
displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it, I got
up from my seat and left.

### 4. The Fruits of the Ascetic Life

#### 4.1. The First Fruit of the Ascetic Life

And so I ask the Buddha: Sir, there are many different professional
fields. These include elephant riders, cavalry, charioteers, archers,
bannermen, adjutants, food servers, warrior-chiefs, princes, chargers,
great warriors, heroes, leather-clad soldiers, and sons of bondservants.
They also include bakers, barbers, bathroom attendants, cooks,
garland-makers, dyers, weavers, basket-makers, potters, accountants,
finger-talliers, or those following any similar professions. All these
live off the fruits of their profession which are apparent in this very
life. With that they make themselves happy and pleased. They make their
parents, their children and partners, and their friends and colleagues
happy and pleased. And they establish an uplifting religious donation
for ascetics and brahmins that's conducive to heaven, ripens in
happiness, and leads to heaven. Sir, can you point out a fruit of the
ascetic life that's likewise apparent in this very life?"

"I can, great king.[^200] Well then, I'll ask you about this in return,
and you can answer as you like.[^201] What do you think, great king?
Suppose you had a person who was a bondservant, a worker. They get up
before you and go to bed after you, and are obliging, behaving nicely
and speaking politely, and gazing up at your face.[^202] They'd think:
'The outcome and result of good deeds is just so incredible, so
amazing![^203] For this King Ajātasattu is a human being,
and so am I.[^204] Yet he amuses himself, supplied and provided with the
five kinds of sensual stimulation as if he were a god. Whereas I'm his
bondservant, his worker. I get up before him and go to bed after him,
and am obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely, and gazing up at
his face. I really should do good deeds.[^205] Why don't I shave off my
hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to
homelessness?'[^206]

After some time, that is what they do. Having gone forth they'd live
restrained in body, speech, and mind, living content with nothing more
than food and clothes, delighting in seclusion.[^207] And suppose your
men were to report all this to you. Would you say to them: 'Bring that
person to me! Let them once more be my bondservant, my worker'?"

"No, sir. Rather, I would bow to them, rise in their presence, and offer
them a seat. I'd invite them to accept robes, almsfood, lodgings, and
medicines and supplies for the sick. And I'd organize their lawful
guarding and protection."[^208]

"What do you think, great king? If this is so, is there a fruit of the
ascetic life apparent in the present life or not?"[^209]

"Clearly, sir, there is."[^210]

"This is the first fruit of the ascetic life that's apparent in this
very life, which I point out to you."

#### 4.2. The Second Fruit of the Ascetic Life

"But sir, can you point out another fruit of the ascetic life that's
likewise apparent in this very life?"[^211]

"I can, great king. Well then, I'll ask you about this in return, and
you can answer as you like. What do you think, great king? Suppose you
had a person who was a farmer, a householder, a hard worker, someone who
builds up their capital.[^212] They'd think: 'The outcome and result of
good deeds is just so incredible, so amazing! For this King
Ajātasattu is a human being, and so am I. Yet he amuses
himself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual
stimulation as if he were a god. Whereas I'm a farmer, a householder, a
hard worker, someone who builds up their capital. I really should do
good deeds. Why don't I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher
robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?'

After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or
small family circle. They'd shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher
robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.[^213] Having gone
forth they'd live restrained in body, speech, and mind, living content
with nothing more than food and clothes, delighting in seclusion. And
suppose your men were to report all this to you. Would you say to them:
'Bring that person to me! Let them once more be a farmer, a householder,
a hard worker, someone who builds up their capital'?"

"No, sir. Rather, I would bow to them, rise in their presence, and offer
them a seat. I'd invite them to accept robes, almsfood, lodgings, and
medicines and supplies for the sick. And I'd organize their lawful
guarding and protection."

"What do you think, great king? If this is so, is there a fruit of the
ascetic life apparent in the present life or not?"

"Clearly, sir, there is."

"This is the second fruit of the ascetic life that's apparent in this
very life, which I point out to you."

#### 4.3. The Finer Fruits of the Ascetic Life

"But sir, can you point out a fruit of the ascetic life that's apparent
in this very life which is better and finer than these?"

"I can, great king. Well then, listen and apply your mind well, I will
speak."[^214]

"Yes, sir," replied the king.

The Buddha said this:

"Consider when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully
awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of
the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods
and humans, awakened, blessed.[^215] He has realized with his own
insight this world---with its gods, Māras, and divinities,
this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans---and he
makes it known to others.[^216] He proclaims a teaching that is good in
the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and
well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that's entirely full
and pure.[^217]

A householder hears that teaching, or a householder's child, or someone
reborn in a good family.[^218] They gain faith in the Realized One and
reflect: 'Life at home is cramped and dirty, life gone forth is wide
open. It's not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual
life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. Why don't I shave off
my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life
to homelessness?'

After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or
small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher
robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.

Once they've gone forth, they live restrained in the monastic code,
conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places.
Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they've
undertaken. They act skillfully by body and speech. They're purified in
livelihood and accomplished in ethical conduct. They guard the sense
doors, have mindfulness and situational awareness, and are
content.[^219]

##### 4.3.1. Ethics

-2.5ex 1.25ex \*4.3.1.1. The Shorter Section on Ethics

And how, great king, is a mendicant accomplished in ethics? It's when a
mendicant gives up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the
sword. They're scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all
living beings.[^220] This pertains to their ethics.

They give up stealing. They take only what's given, and expect only
what's given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving.[^221] This
pertains to their ethics.

They give up unchastity. They are celibate, set apart, avoiding the
vulgar act of sex.[^222] This pertains to their ethics.

They give up lying. They speak the truth and stick to the truth. They're
honest and dependable, and don't trick the world with their words.[^223]
This pertains to their ethics.

They give up divisive speech. They don't repeat in one place what they
heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead,
they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in
harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony. This
pertains to their ethics.

They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that's mellow, pleasing
to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to
the people. This pertains to their ethics.

They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and
meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at
the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.
This pertains to their ethics.

They refrain from injuring plants and seeds. They eat in one part of the
day, abstaining from eating at night and food at the wrong time. They
refrain from seeing shows of dancing, singing, and music . They refrain
from beautifying and adorning themselves with garlands, fragrance, and
makeup. They refrain from high and luxurious beds.[^224] They refrain
from receiving gold and currency, raw grains, raw meat, women and girls,
male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs,
elephants, cows, horses, and mares, and fields and land. They refrain
from running errands and messages; buying and selling; falsifying
weights, metals, or measures; bribery, fraud, cheating, and duplicity;
mutilation, murder, abduction, banditry, plunder, and violence. This
pertains to their ethics.

_*The shorter section on ethics is finished.*_

-2.5ex 1.25ex \*4.3.1.2. The Middle Section on Ethics

quarter in regards to their ethical restraint. When they have this
entire spectrum of noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness
inside themselves.[^225] That's how a mendicant is accomplished in
ethics.

_*The longer section on ethics is finished.*_

##### 4.3.2. Immersion

-2.5ex 1.25ex \*4.3.2.1. Sense Restraint

And how does a mendicant guard the sense doors?[^226] When a mendicant
sees a sight with their eyes, they don't get caught up in the features
and details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad
unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become
overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the
faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint.[^227] When they hear a
sound with their ears ... When they smell an odor with their nose ...
When they taste a flavor with their tongue ... When they feel a touch
with their body ... When they know an idea with their mind, they don't
get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of mind were
left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and
displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice
restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint.
When they have this noble sense restraint, they experience an unsullied
bliss inside themselves.[^228] That's how a mendicant guards the sense
doors.

-2.5ex 1.25ex \*4.3.2.2. Mindfulness and Situational Awareness

And how does a mendicant have mindfulness and situational
awareness?[^229] It's when a mendicant acts with situational awareness
when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when
bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and
robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and
defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking,
and keeping silent.[^230] That's how a mendicant has mindfulness and
situational awareness.

-2.5ex 1.25ex \*4.3.2.3. Contentment

And how is a mendicant content? It's when a mendicant is content with
robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly.
Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things.[^231] They're
like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden. In the same
way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and
almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking
only these things. That's how a mendicant is content.

-2.5ex 1.25ex \*4.3.2.4. Giving Up the Hindrances

When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, this noble sense
restraint, this noble mindfulness and situational awareness, and this
noble contentment,[^232] they frequent a secluded lodging---a
wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a
charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw. After the meal,
they return from almsround, sit down cross-legged, set their body
straight, and establish mindfulness in their presence.[^233]

Giving up covetousness for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of
covetousness, cleansing the mind of covetousness.[^234] Giving up ill
will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of
sympathy for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will.[^235]
Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of
dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing
the mind of dullness and drowsiness.[^236] Giving up restlessness and
remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside,
cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse.[^237] Giving up doubt,
they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful
qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt.[^238]

Suppose a man who has gotten into debt were to apply himself to
work,[^239] and his efforts proved successful. He would pay off the
original loan and have enough left over to support his partner. Thinking
about this, he'd be filled with joy and happiness.

Suppose there was a person who was sick, suffering, gravely ill. They'd
lose their appetite and get physically weak. But after some time they'd
recover from that illness, and regain their appetite and their strength.
Thinking about this, they'd be filled with joy and happiness.

Suppose a person was imprisoned in a jail. But after some time they were
released from jail, safe and sound, with no loss of wealth. Thinking
about this, they'd be filled with joy and happiness.

Suppose a person was a bondservant. They would not be their own master,
but indentured to another, unable to go where they wish. But after some
time they'd be freed from servitude. They would be their own master, not
indentured to another, an emancipated individual able to go where they
wish. Thinking about this, they'd be filled with joy and happiness.

Suppose there was a person with wealth and property who was traveling
along a desert road, which was perilous, with nothing to eat. But after
some time they crossed over the desert safely, arriving within a
village, a sanctuary free of peril. Thinking about this, they'd be
filled with joy and happiness.

In the same way, as long as these five hindrances are not given up
inside themselves, a mendicant regards them thus as a debt, a disease, a
prison, slavery, and a desert crossing.[^240]

But when these five hindrances are given up inside themselves, a
mendicant regards this as freedom from debt, good health, release from
prison, emancipation, and a place of sanctuary at last.[^241]

Seeing that the hindrances have been given up in them, joy springs up.
Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the
body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And
when blissful, the mind becomes immersed.[^242]

-2.5ex 1.25ex \*4.3.2.5. First Absorption

Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful
qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the
rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping
it connected.[^243] They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with
rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There's no part of the body that's
not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion.[^244]

It's like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath
powder into a bronze dish, sprinkling it little by little with water.
They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with
moisture, spread through inside and out; yet no moisture oozes
out.[^245] In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and
spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There's no
part of the body that's not spread with rapture and bliss born of
seclusion. This, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that's
apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the former
ones.[^246]

-2.5ex 1.25ex \*4.3.2.6. Second Absorption

Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are
stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which
has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and
mind at one, without applying the mind and keeping it connected.[^247]
They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss
born of immersion. There's no part of the body that's not spread with
rapture and bliss born of immersion.

It's like a deep lake fed by spring water. There's no inlet to the east,
west, north, or south, and the heavens would not properly bestow showers
from time to time.[^248] But the stream of cool water welling up in the
lake drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads throughout the lake. There's
no part of the lake that's not spread through with cool water.[^249]

In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their
body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There's no part of the
body that's not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion. This
too, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that's apparent in the
present life which is better and finer than the former ones.

-2.5ex 1.25ex \*4.3.2.7. Third Absorption

Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and
remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity,
mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble
ones declare, 'Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.'[^250]
They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with bliss free of
rapture. There's no part of the body that's not spread with bliss free
of rapture.

It's like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some
of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving
underwater. From the tip to the root they're drenched, steeped, filled,
and soaked with cool water. There's no part of them that's not soaked
with cool water.[^251] In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps,
fills, and spreads their body with bliss free of rapture. There's no
part of the body that's not spread with bliss free of rapture. This too,
great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that's apparent in the
present life which is better and finer than the former ones.

-2.5ex 1.25ex \*4.3.2.8. Fourth Absorption

Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness
and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption,
without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.[^252]
They sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There's no
part of the body that's not spread with pure bright mind.[^253]

It's like someone sitting wrapped from head to foot with white cloth.
There's no part of the body that's not spread over with white
cloth.[^254] In the same way, they sit spreading their body through with
pure bright mind. There's no part of the body that's not spread with
pure bright mind. This too, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life
that's apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the
former ones.

##### 4.3.3. The Eight Knowledges

-2.5ex 1.25ex \*4.3.3.1. Knowledge and Vision

When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like
this---purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable,
workable, steady, and imperturbable---they project it and extend it
toward knowledge and vision.[^255] They understand: 'This body of mine
is formed. It's made up of the four principal states, produced by mother
and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to
wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction.[^256] And this
consciousness of mine is attached to it, tied to it.'[^257]

Suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful,
eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent, clear, and unclouded, endowed
with all good qualities. And it was strung with a thread of blue,
yellow, red, white, or golden brown.[^258] And someone with clear eyes
were to take it in their hand and check it: 'This beryl gem is naturally
beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent, clear, and
unclouded, endowed with all good qualities. And it's strung with a
thread of blue, yellow, red, white, or golden brown.'

In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in

which is better and finer than the former ones.

When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like
this---purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable,
workable, steady, and imperturbable---they project it and extend it
toward the creation of a mind-made body.[^260] From this body they
create another body---formed, mind-made, whole in its major and minor
limbs, not deficient in any faculty.[^261]

Suppose a person was to draw a reed out from its sheath. They'd think:
'This is the reed, this is the sheath. The reed and the sheath are
different things. The reed has been drawn out from the sheath.' Or
suppose a person was to draw a sword out from its scabbard. They'd
think: 'This is the sword, this is the scabbard. The sword and the
scabbard are different things. The sword has been drawn out from the
scabbard.' Or suppose a person was to draw a snake out from its slough.
They'd think: 'This is the snake, this is the slough. The snake and the
slough are different things. The snake has been drawn out from the
slough.'

When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like
this---purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable,
workable, steady, and imperturbable---they project it and extend it
toward psychic power.[^262] They wield the many kinds of psychic power:
multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and
disappearing; going unobstructed through a wall, a rampart, or a
mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it
were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged
through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun
and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the
realm of divinity.[^263]

Suppose a deft potter or their apprentice had some well-prepared clay.
They could produce any kind of pot that they like.[^264] Or suppose a
deft ivory-carver or their apprentice had some well-prepared ivory. They

goldsmith or their apprentice had some well-prepared gold. They could
produce any kind of gold item that they like.[^265]

superhuman, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and heavenly, whether
near or far.[^267]

Suppose there was a person traveling along the road. They'd hear the
sound of drums, clay drums, horns, kettledrums, and tom-toms. They'd
think: 'That's the sound of drums,' and 'that's the sound of clay
drums,' and 'that's the sound of horns, kettledrums, and
tom-toms.'[^268]

workable, steady, and imperturbable---they project it and extend it
toward comprehending the minds of others.[^269] They understand the
minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with
their own mind. They understand mind with greed as 'mind with greed',
and mind without greed as 'mind without greed'. They understand mind
with hate ... mind without hate ... mind with delusion ... mind without
delusion ... constricted mind ... scattered mind ... expansive mind ...
unexpansive mind ... mind that is not supreme ... mind that is supreme
... immersed mind ... unimmersed mind ... freed mind ... They understand
unfreed mind as 'unfreed mind'.

Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of
adornments, and they check their own reflection in a clean bright mirror
or a clear bowl of water. If they had a spot they'd know 'I have a
spot,' and if they had no spots they'd know 'I have no spots.'[^270] In

When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like
this---purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable,

toward recollection of past lives.[^271] They recollect many kinds of
past lives, that is, one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty,
forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many
eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many
eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: 'There, I
was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my
food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life
ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else.
There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and
that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was
how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn
here.' And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with
features and details.[^272]

Suppose a person was to leave their home village and go to another
village. From that village they'd go to yet another village. And from
that village they'd return to their home village. They'd think: 'I went
from my home village to another village. There I stood like this, sat
like that, spoke like this, or kept silent like that. From that village
I went to yet another village. There too I stood like this, sat like
that, spoke like this, or kept silent like that. And from that village I
returned to my home village.'[^273]

clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings
passing away and being reborn---inferior and superior, beautiful and
ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient
beings are reborn according to their deeds: 'These dear beings did bad
things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones;
they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When
their body breaks up, after death, they're reborn in a place of loss, a
bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good
things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble
ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view.
When their body breaks up, after death, they're reborn in a good place,
a heavenly realm.' And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and
superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being
reborn---inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a
bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to
their deeds.[^274]

Suppose there was a stilt longhouse at the central square. A person with

-2.5ex 1.25ex \*4.3.3.8. Ending of Defilements

When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like
this---purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable,
workable, steady, and imperturbable---they project it and extend it
toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.[^276] They truly
understand: 'This is suffering' ... 'This is the origin of suffering'
... 'This is the cessation of suffering' ... 'This is the practice that
leads to the cessation of suffering'.[^277] They truly understand:
'These are defilements' ... 'This is the origin of defilements' ...
'This is the cessation of defilements' ... 'This is the practice that
leads to the cessation of defilements'.[^278] Knowing and seeing like
this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to
be reborn, and ignorance.[^279] When they're freed, they know they're
freed.[^280] They understand: 'Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey
has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing
further for this place.'[^281]

Suppose that in a mountain glen there was a lake that was transparent,
clear, and unclouded. A person with clear eyes standing on the bank
would see the clams and mussels, and pebbles and gravel, and schools of
fish swimming about or staying still. They'd think: 'This lake is
transparent, clear, and unclouded. And here are the clams and mussels,
and pebbles and gravel, and schools of fish swimming about or staying
still.'[^282]

In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in
samādhi like this---purified, bright, flawless, rid of
corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable---they project
it and extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements. This
too, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that's apparent in the
present life which is better and finer than the former ones. And, great
king, there is no other fruit of the ascetic life apparent in the
present life which is better and finer than this."[^283]

### 5. Ajātasattu Declares Himself a Lay Follower

When the Buddha had spoken, King Ajātasattu said to him,
"Excellent, sir! Excellent![^284] As if he were righting the overturned,
or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or
lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what's
there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for
refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant
Saṅgha.[^285] From this day forth, may the Buddha remember
me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.

I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me
to take the life of my father, a just and principled king, for the sake
of authority.[^286] Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I
will restrain myself in future."[^287]

"Indeed, great king, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and
unskillful of you to take the life of your father, a just and principled
king, for the sake of sovereignty.[^288] But since you have recognized
your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept
it. For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a
mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint
in the future."[^289]

When the Buddha had spoken, King Ajātasattu said to him,
"Well, now, sir, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do."

"Please, great king, go at your convenience."

Then the king, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, got
up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled him, keeping him on
his right, before leaving.

Soon after the king had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "The
king is broken, mendicants,[^290] he is ruined. If he had not taken the
life of his father, a just and principled king, the stainless,
immaculate vision of the Dhamma would have arisen in him in that very
seat."[^291]

That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants approved what
the Buddha said.
