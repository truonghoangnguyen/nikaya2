## DN 4 With Soṇadaṇḍa *Soṇadaṇḍasutta*

### 1. The Brahmins and Householders of Campā

[So I have heard.[^376]]{.smallcaps} At one time the Buddha was
wandering in the land of the Aṅgas together with a large
Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at
Campā,[^377] where he stayed by the banks of the
Gaggarā Lotus Pond.[^378]

Now at that time the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa was living in
Campā. It was a crown property given by King Seniya
Bimbisāra of Magadha, teeming with living creatures, full
of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin.[^379]

The brahmins and householders of Campā heard:[^380]

"It seems the ascetic Gotama---a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan
family---has arrived at Campā and is staying on the banks
of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. He has this good reputation:
'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in
knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for
those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.'
He has realized with his own insight this world---with its gods,
Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics
and brahmins, gods and humans---and he makes it known to others. He
proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle,
and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a
spiritual practice that's entirely full and pure. It's good to see such
perfected ones." Then, having departed Campā, they formed
into companies and headed to the Gaggarā Lotus Pond.

Now at that time the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa had retired to the
upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday nap. He saw the
brahmins and householders heading for the lotus pond, and addressed his
butler, "My butler, why are the brahmins and householders headed for the
Gaggarā Lotus Pond?"

"The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Campā and is staying on
the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. He has this good
reputation: 'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha,
accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world,
supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans,
awakened, blessed.' They're going to see that Mister Gotama."

"Well then, go to the brahmins and householders and say to them: 'Sirs,
the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa asks you to wait, as he will also go
to see the ascetic Gotama.'"

"Yes, sir," replied the butler, and did as he was asked.

### 2. The Qualities of Soṇadaṇḍa

Now at that time around five hundred brahmins from abroad were residing
in Campā on some business. They heard that the brahmin
Soṇadaṇḍa was going to see the ascetic Gotama. They
approached Soṇadaṇḍa and said to him, "Is it really true
that you are going to see the ascetic Gotama?"

"Yes, gentlemen, it is true."

"Please don't, mister Soṇadaṇḍa! It's not appropriate for
you to go to see the ascetic Gotama.[^381] For if you do so, your
reputation will diminish and his will increase. For this reason it's not
appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama; it's appropriate
that he comes to see you.

You are well born on both your mother's and father's side, of pure
descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh
paternal generation.[^382] For this reason it's not appropriate for you
to go to see the ascetic Gotama; it's appropriate that he comes to see
you.

You're rich, affluent, and wealthy. ...

You recite and remember the hymns, and have mastered the three Vedas,
together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology
and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. You know them
word-by-word, and their grammar. You are well versed in cosmology and
the marks of a great man. ...

You are attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. You are
magnificent and splendid as the Divinity, remarkable to behold.
...[^383]

You are ethical, mature in ethical conduct. ...

You're a good speaker who enunciates well, with a polished, clear, and
articulate voice that expresses the meaning. ...

You tutor the tutors of many, and teach three hundred young students to
recite the hymns. Many students come from various districts and
countries for the sake of the hymns, wishing to learn the hymns.
...[^384]

You're old, elderly and senior, advanced in years, and have reached the
final stage of life. The ascetic Gotama is young, and has newly gone
forth. ...

You're honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by King
Bimbisāra of Magadha ...

and the brahmin Pokkharasāti. ...

You live in Campā, a crown property given by King Seniya
Bimbisāra of Magadha, teeming with living creatures, full
of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin. For
this reason, too, it's not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic
Gotama; it's appropriate that he comes to see you."

### 3. The Qualities of the Buddha

When they had spoken, Soṇadaṇḍa said to those brahmins:

"Well then, gentlemen, listen to why it's appropriate for me to go to
see the ascetic Gotama, and it's not appropriate for him to come to see
me. He is well born on both his mother's and father's side, of pure
descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh
paternal generation. For this reason it's not appropriate for the
ascetic Gotama to come to see me; rather, it's appropriate for me to go
to see him.

When he went forth he abandoned a large family circle. ...

When he went forth he abandoned abundant gold, both coined and uncoined,
stored in dungeons and towers. ...

He went forth from the lay life to homelessness while still a youth,
young, with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of
life. ...

Though his mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful
faces, he shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and
went forth from the lay life to homelessness. ...[^385]

He is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. He is
magnificent and splendid as the Divinity, remarkable to behold. ...

He is ethical, possessing ethical conduct that is noble and skillful.
...

He's a good speaker who enunciates well, with a polished, clear, and
articulate voice that expresses the meaning. ...

He's a tutor of tutors. ...

He has ended sensual desire, and is rid of caprice. ...

He teaches the efficacy of deeds and action. He doesn't wish any harm
upon the community of brahmins. ...[^386]

He went forth from an eminent family of unbroken aristocratic lineage.
...

He went forth from a rich, affluent, and wealthy family. ...

People come from distant lands and distant countries to question him.
...

Many thousands of deities have gone for refuge for life to him. ...

He has this good reputation: 'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully
awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of
the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods
and humans, awakened, blessed.' ...

He has the thirty-two marks of a great man. ...

He is welcoming, congenial, polite, smiling, open, the first to speak.
...[^387]

He's honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by the four
assemblies. ...[^388]

Many gods and humans are devoted to him. ...

While he is residing in a village or town, non-human entities do not
harass them. ...

He leads an order and a community, and tutors a community, and is said
to be the best of the various religious founders. He didn't come by his
fame in the same ways as those other ascetics and brahmins.[^389]
Rather, he came by his fame due to his supreme knowledge and conduct.
...

King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and his wives and children
have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama. ...[^390]

King Pasenadi of Kosala and his wives and children have gone for refuge
for life to the ascetic Gotama. ...[^391]

The brahmin Pokkharasāti and his wives and children have
gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama. ...[^392]

He's honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by King
Bimbisāra of Magadha ...

King Pasenadi of Kosala ...

and the brahmin Pokkharasāti.

The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Campā and is staying at
the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. Any ascetic or brahmin who comes to
stay in our village district is our guest, and should be honored and
respected as such. For this reason, too, it's not appropriate for Mister
Gotama to come to see me; rather, it's appropriate for me to go to see
him. This is the extent of Mister Gotama's praise that I have memorized.
But his praises are not confined to this, for the praise of Mister
Gotama is limitless."

When he had spoken, those brahmins said to him, "According to
Soṇadaṇḍa's praises, if Mister Gotama were staying within a
hundred leagues, it'd be worthwhile for a faithful gentleman to go to
see him, even if he had to carry his own provisions in a
knapsack."[^393]

"Well then, gentlemen, let's all go to see the ascetic Gotama."

### 4. Soṇadaṇḍa Has Second Thoughts

Then Soṇadaṇḍa together with a large group of brahmins went
to see the Buddha.

But as he reached the far side of the forest, this thought came to mind,
"Suppose I was to ask the ascetic Gotama a question. He might say to me:
'Brahmin, you shouldn't ask your question like that. This is how you
should ask it.' And the assembly might disparage me for that:
'Soṇadaṇḍa is foolish and incompetent. He's not able to ask
the ascetic Gotama a rational question.'[^394] And when you're
disparaged by the assembly, your reputation diminishes. When your
reputation diminishes, your wealth also diminishes. But my wealth relies
on my reputation.

Or if the ascetic Gotama asks me a question, I might not satisfy him
with my answer. He might say to me: 'Brahmin, you shouldn't answer the
question like that. This is how you should answer it.' And the assembly
might disparage me for that: 'Soṇadaṇḍa is foolish and
incompetent. He's not able to satisfy the ascetic Gotama's mind with his
answer.' And when you're disparaged by the assembly, your reputation
diminishes. When your reputation diminishes, your wealth also
diminishes. But my wealth relies on my reputation.

On the other hand, if I were to turn back after having come so far
without having seen the ascetic Gotama, the assembly might disparage me
for that: 'Soṇadaṇḍa is foolish and incompetent. He's
stuck-up and scared. He doesn't dare to go and see the ascetic Gotama.
For how on earth can he turn back after having come so far without
having seen the ascetic Gotama!' And when you're disparaged by the
assembly, your reputation diminishes. When your reputation diminishes,
your wealth also diminishes. But my wealth relies on my reputation."

Then Soṇadaṇḍa went up to the Buddha, and exchanged
greetings with him.[^395] When the greetings and polite conversation
were over, he sat down to one side. Before sitting down to one side,
some of the brahmins and householders of Campā bowed, some
exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined
palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some
kept silent.

But while sitting there, Soṇadaṇḍa continued to be plagued
by many second thoughts. He thought, "If only the ascetic Gotama would
ask me about my own tutor's scriptural heritage of the three Vedas! Then
I could definitely satisfy his mind with my answer."

### 5. What Makes a Brahmin

Then the Buddha, knowing Soṇadaṇḍa's train of thought,
thought, "This brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa is troubled by his own
thoughts. Why don't I ask him about his own tutor's scriptural heritage
of the three Vedas?"[^396]

So he said to Soṇadaṇḍa, "Brahmin, how many factors must a
brahmin possess for the brahmins to describe him as a brahmin; and so
that when he says 'I am a brahmin' he speaks rightly, without falling
into falsehood?"

Then Soṇadaṇḍa thought, "The ascetic Gotama has asked me
about exactly what I wanted, what I wished for, what I desired, what I
yearned for; that is, my own scriptural heritage. I can definitely
satisfy his mind with my answer."

Then Soṇadaṇḍa straightened his back, looked around the
assembly, and said to the Buddha, "Mister Gotama, a brahmin must possess
five factors for the brahmins to describe him as a brahmin; and so that
when he says 'I am a brahmin' he speaks rightly, without falling into
falsehood. What five? It's when a brahmin is well born on both his
mother's and father's side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and
impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation. He recites
and remembers the hymns, and has mastered the three Vedas, together with
their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word
classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knows them word-by-word,
and their grammar. He is well versed in cosmology and the marks of a
great man. He is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty.
He is magnificent and splendid as the Divinity, remarkable to behold. He
is ethical, mature in ethical conduct. He's astute and clever, being the
first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle.[^397] These are the five
factors which a brahmin must possess for the brahmins to describe him as
a brahmin; and so that when he says 'I am a brahmin' he speaks rightly,
without falling into falsehood."

"But brahmin, is it possible to set aside one of these five factors and
still rightly describe someone as a brahmin?"[^398]

"It is possible, Mister Gotama. We could leave appearance out of the
five factors. For what does appearance matter? A brahmin must possess
the remaining four factors for the brahmins to rightly describe him as a
brahmin."

"But brahmin, is it possible to set aside one of these four factors and
still rightly describe someone as a brahmin?"

"It is possible, Mister Gotama. We could leave the hymns out of the four
factors. For what do the hymns matter? A brahmin must possess the
remaining three factors for the brahmins to rightly describe him as a
brahmin."

"But brahmin, is it possible to set aside one of these three factors and
still rightly describe someone as a brahmin?"

"It is possible, Mister Gotama. We could leave birth out of the three
factors. For what does birth matter? It's when a brahmin is ethical,
mature in ethical conduct; and he's astute and clever, being the first
or second to hold the sacrificial ladle. A brahmin must possess these
two factors for the brahmins to rightly describe him as a brahmin."

When he had spoken, those brahmins said to him, "Please don't say that,
mister Soṇadaṇḍa, please don't say that! You're just
condemning appearance, the hymns, and birth! You're totally going over
to the ascetic Gotama's doctrine!"

So the Buddha said to them, "Well, brahmins, if you think that
Soṇadaṇḍa is unlearned, a poor speaker, witless, and not
capable of debating with me about this, then leave him aside and you can
debate with me. But if you think that he's learned, a good speaker who
enunciates well, astute, and capable of debating with me about this,
then you should stand aside and let him debate with me."

When he said this, Soṇadaṇḍa said to the Buddha, "Let it
be, Mister Gotama, be silent. I myself will respond to them in a
legitimate manner." Then he said to those brahmins, "Don't say this,
good sirs, don't say this: 'You're just condemning appearance, the
hymns, and birth! You're totally going over to the ascetic Gotama's
doctrine!' I'm not condemning appearance, hymns, or birth."

Now at that time Soṇadaṇḍa's nephew, the young student
Aṅgaka was sitting in that assembly. Then
Soṇadaṇḍa said to those brahmins, "Gentlemen, do you see my
nephew, the young student Aṅgaka?"

"Yes, sir."

"Aṅgaka is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing
beauty. He is magnificent and splendid as the Divinity, remarkable to
behold. There's no-one in this assembly so good-looking, apart from the
ascetic Gotama. Aṅgaka recites and remembers the hymns, and
has mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and
ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the
testaments as fifth. He knows them word-by-word, and their grammar. He
is well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. And I am the
one who teaches him the hymns. Aṅgaka is well born on both
his mother's and father's side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and
impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation. And I know
his mother and father. But if Aṅgaka were to kill living
creatures, steal, commit adultery, lie, and drink liquor, then what's
the use of his appearance, his hymns, or his birth? It's when a brahmin
is ethical, mature in ethical conduct; and he's astute and clever, being
the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle. A brahmin must
possess these two factors for the brahmins to rightly describe him as a
brahmin."

### 6. The Discussion of Ethics and Wisdom

"But brahmin, is it possible to set aside one of these two factors and
still rightly describe someone as a brahmin?"

"No, Mister Gotama. For wisdom is cleansed by ethics, and ethics are
cleansed by wisdom. Ethics and wisdom always go together. An ethical
person is wise, and a wise person ethical. And ethics and wisdom are
said to be the best things in the world. It's just like when you clean
one hand with the other, or clean one foot with the other. In the same
way, wisdom is cleansed by ethics, and ethics are cleansed by wisdom.
Ethics and wisdom always go together. An ethical person is wise, and a
wise person ethical. And ethics and wisdom are said to be the best
things in the world."

"That's so true, brahmin, that's so true! For wisdom is cleansed by
ethics, and ethics are cleansed by wisdom.[^399] Ethics and wisdom
always go together. An ethical person is wise, and a wise person
ethical. And ethics and wisdom are said to be the best things in the
world. It's just like when you clean one hand with the other, or clean
one foot with the other. In the same way, wisdom is cleansed by ethics,
and ethics are cleansed by wisdom. Ethics and wisdom always go together.
An ethical person is wise, and a wise person ethical. And ethics and
wisdom are said to be the best things in the world.

But what, brahmin, is that ethical conduct?[^400] And what is that
wisdom?"

"That's all I know about this matter, Mister Gotama. May Mister Gotama
himself please clarify the meaning of this."

"Well then, brahmin, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes sir," Soṇadaṇḍa replied. The Buddha said this:

"It's when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully
awakened Buddha ... That's how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics.
This, brahmin, is that ethical conduct. ... They enter and remain in the
first absorption ...[^401] second absorption ... third absorption ...
fourth absorption ... They project and extend the mind toward knowledge
and vision ... This pertains to their wisdom. ... They understand: '...
there is nothing further for this place.' This pertains to their wisdom.
This, brahmin, is that wisdom."

### 7. Soṇadaṇḍa Declares Himself a Lay Follower

When he had spoken, Soṇadaṇḍa said to the Buddha,
"Excellent, Mister Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the
overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the
lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see
what's there, Mister Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways. I
go for refuge to Mister Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant
Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Mister Gotama remember me
as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life. Would you and the
mendicant Saṅgha please accept a meal from me tomorrow?"
The Buddha consented with silence.

Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Soṇadaṇḍa got
up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping
him on his right, before leaving. And when the night had passed
Soṇadaṇḍa had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in
his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, "It's
time, Mister Gotama, the meal is ready." Then the Buddha robed up in the
morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of
Soṇadaṇḍa together with the mendicant Saṅgha,
where he sat on the seat spread out. Then Soṇadaṇḍa served
and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha
with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.

When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl,
Soṇadaṇḍa took a low seat and sat to one side. Seated to
one side he said to the Buddha: "Mister Gotama, if, when I have gone to
an assembly, I rise from my seat and bow to the Buddha, that assembly
might disparage me for that. And when you're disparaged by the assembly,
your reputation diminishes. When your reputation diminishes, your wealth
also diminishes. But my wealth relies on my reputation. If, when I have
gone to an assembly, I raise my joined palms, please take it that I have
risen from my seat. And if I undo my turban, please take it that I have
bowed. And Mister Gotama, if, when I am in a carriage, I get down from
my carriage and bow to the Buddha, that assembly might disparage me for
that. If, when I am in a carriage, I hold up my goad, please take it
that I have got down from my carriage. And if I lower my sunshade,
please take it that I have bowed."[^402]

Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired the brahmin
Soṇadaṇḍa with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from
his seat and left.
