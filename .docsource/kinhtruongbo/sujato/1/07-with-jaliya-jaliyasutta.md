## DN 7 With Jāliya *Jāliyasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Kosambī, in Ghosita's Monastery.[^476]

Now at that time two renunciates---the wanderer Muṇḍiya and
Jāliya, the pupil of the wood-bowl ascetic---came to the
Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite
conversation were over, they stood to one side and said to the Buddha,
"Reverend Gotama, are the soul and the body the same thing, or they are
different things?"

"Well then, reverends, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, reverend," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Take the case when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a
fully awakened Buddha ... That's how a mendicant is accomplished in
ethics. ...

They enter and remain in the first absorption ... When a mendicant knows
and sees like this, would it be appropriate to say of them: 'The soul
and the body are the same thing' or 'The soul and the body are different
things'?"

"It would, reverend."

"But reverends, I know and see like this. Nevertheless, I do not say:
'The soul and the body are the same thing' or 'The soul and the body are
different things'. ...

They enter and remain in the second absorption ... third absorption ...
fourth absorption. When a mendicant knows and sees like this, would it
be appropriate to say of them: 'The soul and the body are the same
thing' or 'The soul and the body are different things'?"

"It would, reverend."

"But reverends, I know and see like this. Nevertheless, I do not say:
'The soul and the body are the same thing' or 'The soul and the body are
different things'. ...

They project and extend the mind toward knowledge and vision ... When a
mendicant knows and sees like this, would it be appropriate to say of
them: 'The soul and the body are the same thing' or 'The soul and the
body are different things'?"

"It would, reverend."

"But reverends, I know and see like this. Nevertheless, I do not say:
'The soul and the body are the same thing' or 'The soul and the body are
different things'. ...

They understand: '... there is nothing further for this place.' When a
mendicant knows and sees like this, would it be appropriate to say of
them: 'The soul and the body are the same thing' or 'The soul and the
body are different things'?"

"It would not, reverend."

"But reverends, I know and see like this. Nevertheless, I do not say:
'The soul and the body are the same thing' or 'The soul and the body are
different things'."

That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the two renunciates approved
what the Buddha said.
