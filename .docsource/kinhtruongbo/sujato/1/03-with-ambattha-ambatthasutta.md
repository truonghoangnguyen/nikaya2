## DN 3 With Ambaṭṭha *Ambaṭṭhasutta*

[So I have heard.[^292]]{.smallcaps} At one time the Buddha was
wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large
Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a
village of the Kosalan brahmins named Icchānaṅgala.[^293]
He stayed in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.

### 1. The Section on Pokkharasāti

Now at that time the brahmin Pokkharasāti was living in
Ukkaṭṭhā. It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of
Kosala, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and
grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin.[^294]
Pokkharasāti heard:

"It seems the ascetic Gotama---a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan
family---has arrived at Icchānaṅgala and is staying in a
forest nearby. He has this good reputation: 'That Blessed One is
perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and
conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to
train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.' He has realized
with his own insight this world---with its gods, Māras, and
divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and
humans---and he makes it known to others.[^295] He proclaims a teaching
that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end,
meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that's
entirely full and pure. It's good to see such perfected ones."[^296]

### 2. The Student Ambaṭṭha

Now at that time Pokkharasāti had a student named
Ambaṭṭha as his resident pupil. He was one who recited and
remembered the hymns, and had mastered in the three Vedas, together with
their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word
classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knew them word-by-word,
and their grammar. He was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a
great man. He had been authorized as a master in his own tutor's
scriptural heritage of the three Vedas with the words:[^297] "What I
know, you know.[^298] And what you know, I know."

Then Pokkharasāti addressed Ambaṭṭha, "Dear
Ambaṭṭha, the ascetic Gotama---a Sakyan, gone forth from a
Sakyan family---has arrived at Icchānaṅgala and is staying
in a forest nearby. He has this good reputation ... It's good to see
such perfected ones. Please, dear Ambaṭṭha, go to the
ascetic Gotama and find out whether or not he lives up to his
reputation. Through you I shall learn about Mister Gotama."[^299]

"But sir, how shall I find out whether or not the ascetic Gotama lives
up to his reputation?"

"Dear Ambaṭṭha, the thirty-two marks of a great man have
been handed down in our hymns. A great man who possesses these has only
two possible destinies, no other.[^300] If he stays at home he becomes a
king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion
extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he
possesses the seven treasures.[^301] He has the following seven
treasures: the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the
householder, and the commander as the seventh treasure. He has over a
thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his
enemies.[^302] After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigns by
principle, without rod or sword. But if he goes forth from the lay life
to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha,
who draws back the veil from the world. But, dear Ambaṭṭha,
I am the one who gives the hymns,[^303] and you are the one who receives
them."

"Yes, sir," replied Ambaṭṭha. He got up from his seat,
bowed, and respectfully circled Pokkharasāti, keeping him
to his right. He mounted a chariot drawn by mares and, together with
several young students, set out for the forest near
Icchānaṅgala.[^304] He went by carriage as far as the
terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on foot.

At that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open
air.[^305] Then the student Ambaṭṭha went up to those
mendicants and said, "Good sirs, where is Mister Gotama at
present?[^306] For we have come here to see him."[^307]

Then those mendicants thought, "This Ambaṭṭha is from a
well-known family, and he is the pupil of the well-known brahmin
Pokkharasāti. The Buddha won't mind having a discussion
together with such gentlemen."[^308]

They said to Ambaṭṭha, "Ambaṭṭha, that's his
dwelling, with the door closed. Approach it quietly, without hurrying;
go onto the porch, clear your throat, and knock on the door-panel. The
Buddha will open the door."[^309]

So he approached the Buddha's dwelling, cleared his throat and knocked
on the door-panel, and the Buddha opened the door. Ambaṭṭha
and the young students entered the dwelling. The young students
exchanged greetings with the Buddha, and when the greetings and polite
conversation were over, sat down to one side. But while the Buddha was
sitting, Ambaṭṭha spoke some polite words or other while
walking around or standing.

So the Buddha said to him, "Ambaṭṭha, is this how you hold
a discussion with elderly and senior brahmins, the tutors of tutors:
walking around or standing while I'm sitting, speaking some polite words
or other?"[^310]

#### 2.1. The First Use of the Word "Primitives"

"No, Mister Gotama. For it is proper for one brahmin to converse with
another while both are walking, standing, sitting, or lying down. But as
to these shavelings, fake ascetics, primitives, black spawn from the
feet of our kinsman, I converse with them as I do with Mister
Gotama."[^311]

"But Ambaṭṭha, you must have come here for some purpose.
You should focus on that. Though this Ambaṭṭha is
unqualified, he thinks he's qualified. What is that but lack of
qualifications?"[^312]

When he said this, Ambaṭṭha became angry and upset with the
Buddha because of being described as unqualified. He even attacked and
badmouthed the Buddha himself, saying, "The ascetic Gotama will be
worsted!" He said to the Buddha, "Mister Gotama, the Sakyans are rude,
harsh, touchy, and argumentative.[^313] Primitive they are, and
primitive they remain! They don't honor, respect, revere, worship, or
venerate brahmins.[^314] It is neither proper nor appropriate that the
Sakyans---primitives that they are---don't honor, respect, revere,
worship, or venerate brahmins."

And that's how Ambaṭṭha denigrated the Sakyans with the
word "primitives" for the first time.

#### 2.2. The Second Use of the Word "Primitives"

"But Ambaṭṭha, how have the Sakyans wronged you?"

"This one time, Mister Gotama, I went to Kapilavatthu on some business
for my tutor, the brahmin Pokkharasāti. I approached the
Sakyans in their town hall. Now at that time several Sakyans and Sakyan
princes were sitting on high seats, poking each other with their
fingers, giggling and playing together. In fact, they even presumed to
giggle at me, and didn't invite me to a seat. It is neither proper nor
appropriate that the Sakyans---primitives that they are---don't honor,
respect, revere, worship, or venerate brahmins."

And that's how Ambaṭṭha denigrated the Sakyans with the
word "primitives" for the second time.

#### 2.3. The Third Use of the Word "Primitives"

"Even a little quail, Ambaṭṭha, speaks as she likes in her
own nest. Kapilavatthu is the Sakyans' own place, Ambaṭṭha.
It's not worthy of the Venerable Ambaṭṭha to lose his
temper over such a small thing."[^315]

"Mister Gotama, there are these four classes: aristocrats, brahmins,
peasants, and menials. Three of these classes---aristocrats, peasants,
and menials---in fact succeed only when serving the brahmins. It is
neither proper nor appropriate that the Sakyans---primitives that they
are---don't honor, respect, revere, worship, or venerate brahmins."

And that's how Ambaṭṭha denigrated the Sakyans with the
word "primitives" for the third time.

#### 2.4. The Word "Son of a Slavegirl" is Used

Then it occurred to the Buddha, "This Ambaṭṭha puts the
Sakyans down way too much by calling them primitives. Why don't I ask
him about his own clan?"

So the Buddha said to him, "What is your clan,
Ambaṭṭha?"[^316]

"I am a Kaṇhāyana, Mister Gotama."[^317]

"But, recollecting the ancient name and clan of your mother and father,
the Sakyans were the children of the masters, while you're descended
from the son of a slavegirl of the Sakyans.[^318] But the Sakyans regard
King Okkāka as their grandfather.[^319]

Once upon a time, King Okkāka, wishing to divert the royal
succession to the son of his most beloved queen, banished the elder
princes from the realm---Okkāmukha, Karakaṇḍa,
Hatthinika, and Sinisūra. They made their home beside a
lotus pond on the slopes of the Himalayas, where there was a large grove
of *sakhua* trees.[^320] For fear of breaking their line of birth, they
slept with their own (*saka*) sisters.[^321]

Then King Okkāka addressed his ministers and councillors,
'Where, sirs, have the princes settled now?'[^322]

'Sire, there is a lotus pond on the slopes of the Himalayas, by a large
grove of *sakhua* trees. They've settled there. For fear of breaking
their line of birth, they are sleeping with their own sisters.'

Then, Ambaṭṭha, King Okkāka expressed this
heartfelt sentiment: 'The princes are indeed Sakyans! The princes are
indeed the best Sakyans!'[^323] From that day on the Sakyans were
recognized and he was their founder.

Now, King Okkāka had a slavegirl named
Disā.[^324] She gave birth to a boy named "Black".[^325]
When he was born, Black Boy said: 'Wash me, mum, bathe me! Get this
filth off of me! I will be useful for you!'[^326] Whereas these days
when people see goblins they recognize them as goblins, in those days
they recognized goblins as 'blackboys'.

They said: 'He spoke as soon as he was born---a blackboy is born! A
goblin is born!' From that day on the Kaṇhāyanas were
proclaimed, and he was their founder. That's how, recollecting the
ancient name and clan of your mother and father, the Sakyans were the
children of the masters, while you're descended from the son of a
slavegirl of the Sakyans."

When he said this, those young students said to him, "Mister Gotama,
please don't put Ambaṭṭha down too much by calling him the
son of a slavegirl.[^327] He's well-born, a gentleman, learned, who
enunciates well, and is astute. He is capable of debating with Mister
Gotama about this."

So the Buddha said to them, "Well, young students, if you think that
Ambaṭṭha is ill-born, not a gentleman, unlearned, a poor
speaker, witless, and not capable of debating with me about this, then
leave him aside and you can debate with me. But if you think that he's
well-born, a gentleman, learned, who enunciates well, is astute, and is
capable of debating with me about this, then you should stand aside and
let him debate with me."

"He is capable of debating you. We will be silent, and let
Ambaṭṭha debate with Mister Gotama about this."

So the Buddha said to Ambaṭṭha, "Well,
Ambaṭṭha, there's a legitimate question that comes up. You
won't like it, but you ought to answer anyway. If you fail to
answer---by dodging the issue, remaining silent, or leaving---your head
will explode into seven pieces right here.[^328] What do you think,
Ambaṭṭha? According to what you have heard from elderly and
senior brahmins, the tutors of tutors, what is the origin of the
Kaṇhāyanas, and who is their founder?"

When he said this, Ambaṭṭha kept silent.

For a second time, the Buddha put the question, and for a second time
Ambaṭṭha kept silent.

So the Buddha said to him, "Answer now, Ambaṭṭha. Now is
not the time for silence. If someone fails to answer a legitimate
question when asked three times by the Buddha, their head explodes into
seven pieces there and then."

Now at that time the spirit Vajirapāṇī, holding a massive
iron spear, burning, blazing, and glowing, stood in the air above
Ambaṭṭha, thinking,[^329] "If this Ambaṭṭha
doesn't answer when asked a third time, I'll blow his head into seven
pieces there and then!" And both the Buddha and Ambaṭṭha
could see Vajirapāṇī.

Ambaṭṭha was terrified, shocked, and awestruck. Looking to
the Buddha for shelter, protection, and refuge, he sat down close by the
Buddha and said, "What did you say? Please repeat the question."

"What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? According to what you have
heard from elderly and senior brahmins, the tutors of tutors, what is
the origin of the Kaṇhāyanas, and who is their founder?"

"I have heard, Mister Gotama, that it is just as you say. That's the
origin of the Kaṇhāyanas, and that's who their founder is."

#### 2.5. The Discussion of Ambaṭṭha's Heritage

When he said this, those young students made an uproar, "It turns out
Ambaṭṭha is ill-born, not a gentleman, son of a Sakyan
slavegirl, and that the Sakyans are sons of his masters! And it seems
that the ascetic Gotama spoke only the truth, though we presumed to
rebuke him!"

Then it occurred to the Buddha, "These young students put
Ambaṭṭha down too much by calling him the son of a
slavegirl. Why don't I get him out of this?"

So the Buddha said to the young students, "Young students, please don't
put Ambaṭṭha down too much by calling him the son of a
slavegirl. That Black Boy was an eminent sage.[^330] He went to a
southern country and memorized the Divine Spell. Then he approached King
Okkāka and asked for the hand of his daughter
Maddarūpī.[^331]

The king said to him, 'Who the hell is this son of a slavegirl to ask
for the hand of my daughter!' Angry and upset he fastened a razor-tipped
arrow.[^332] But he wasn't able to either shoot it or to relax it.

Then the ministers and councillors approached the sage Black Boy and
said: 'Spare the king, sir, spare him!'

'The king will be safe. But if he shoots the arrow downwards, there will
be an earthquake across the entire realm.'[^333]

'Spare the king, sir, and spare the country!'

'Both king and country will be safe. But if he shoots the arrow upwards,
there will be no rain in the entire realm for seven years.'

'Spare the king, sir, spare the country, and let there be rain!'[^334]

'Both king and country will be safe, and the rain will fall. And if the
king shoots the crown prince with an arrow, he will be safe and
unruffled.'[^335]

So the ministers said to Okkāka:[^336] 'Okkāka
must shoot the crown prince with an arrow. He will be safe and
unruffled.'

So King Okkāka shot the crown prince with an arrow. And he
was safe and unruffled. Then the king was terrified, shocked, and
awestruck. Scared by the divine punishment, he gave the hand of his
daughter Maddarūpī.[^337]

Young students, please don't put Ambaṭṭha down too much by
calling him the son of a slavegirl. That Black Boy was an eminent sage."

### 3. The Supremacy of the Aristocrats

Then the Buddha addressed Ambaṭṭha, "What do you think,
Ambaṭṭha? Suppose an aristocrat boy was to sleep with a
brahmin girl, and they had a son. Would he receive a seat and water from
the brahmins?"

"He would, Mister Gotama."

"And would the brahmins feed him at an offering of food for ancestors,
an offering of a dish of milk-rice, a sacrifice, or a feast for guests?"

"They would."

"And would the brahmins teach him the hymns or not?"

"They would."

"And would he be kept from the women or not?"[^338]

"He would not."

"And would the aristocrats anoint him as king?"

"No, Mister Gotama. Why is that? Because his maternity is unsuitable."

"What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Suppose a brahmin boy was to
sleep with an aristocrat girl, and they had a son. Would he receive a
seat and water from the brahmins?"

"He would, Mister Gotama."

"And would the brahmins feed him at an offering of food for ancestors,
an offering of a dish of milk-rice, a sacrifice, or a feast for guests?"

"They would."

"And would the brahmins teach him the hymns or not?"

"They would."

"And would he be kept from the women or not?"

"He would not."

"And would the aristocrats anoint him as king?"

"No, Mister Gotama. Why is that? Because his paternity is unsuitable."

"And so, Ambaṭṭha, the aristocrats are superior and the
brahmins inferior, whether comparing women with women or men with men.
What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Suppose the brahmins for some
reason were to shave a brahmin's head, inflict him with a sack of ashes,
and banish him from the nation or the city. Would he receive a seat and
water from the brahmins?"

"No, Mister Gotama."

"And would the brahmins feed him at an offering of food for ancestors,
an offering of a dish of milk-rice, a sacrifice, or a feast for guests?"

"No, Mister Gotama."

"And would the brahmins teach him the hymns or not?"

"No, Mister Gotama."

"And would he be kept from the women or not?"

"He would be."

"What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Suppose the aristocrats for
some reason were to shave an aristocrat's head, inflict him with a sack
of ashes, and banish him from the nation or the city. Would he receive a
seat and water from the brahmins?"

"He would, Mister Gotama."

"And would the brahmins feed him at an offering of food for ancestors,
an offering of a dish of milk-rice, a sacrifice, or a feast for guests?"

"They would."

"And would the brahmins teach him the hymns or not?"

"They would."

"And would he be kept from the women or not?"

"He would not."

"At this point, Ambaṭṭha, that aristocrat has reached rock
bottom, with head shaven, inflicted with a sack of ashes, and banished
from city or nation. Yet still the aristocrats are superior and the
brahmins inferior. The divinity Sanaṅkumāra also spoke this
verse:[^339]

> 'The aristocrat is best among people\
> who take clan as the standard.\
> But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct\
> is first among gods and humans.'

That verse was well sung by the Divinity Sanaṅkumāra, not
poorly sung; well spoken, not poorly spoken, beneficial, not harmful,
and it was approved by me. For I also say this:

> The aristocrat is best among people\
> who take clan as the standard.\
> But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct\
> is first among gods and humans."

_*The first recitation section.*_

### 4. Knowledge and Conduct

"But what, Mister Gotama, is that conduct, and what is that
knowledge?"[^340]

"Ambaṭṭha, in the supreme knowledge and conduct there is no
discussion of genealogy or clan or pride---[^341] 'You deserve me' or
'You don't deserve me.' Wherever there is giving and taking in marriage
there is such discussion. Whoever is attached to questions of genealogy
or clan or pride, or to giving and taking in marriage, is far from the
supreme knowledge and conduct. The realization of supreme knowledge and
conduct occurs when you've given up such things."[^342]

"But what, Mister Gotama, is that conduct, and what is that knowledge?"

"Ambaṭṭha, it's when a Realized One arises in the world,
perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and
conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to
train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. He has realized
with his own insight this world---with its gods, Māras, and
divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and
humans---and he makes it known to others. He proclaims a teaching that
is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end,
meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that's
entirely full and pure. A householder hears that teaching, or a
householder's child, or someone reborn in a good family. They gain faith
in the Realized One and reflect ...[^343]

Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful
qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption ... This
pertains to their conduct.

Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are
stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption ...
This pertains to their conduct.

Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in
the third absorption ... This pertains to their conduct.

Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness
and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption ... This
pertains to their conduct. This is that conduct.

When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like
this---purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable,
workable, steady, and imperturbable---they project it and extend it
toward knowledge and vision. This pertains to their knowledge. ... They
understand: 'There is nothing further for this place.' This pertains to
their knowledge. This is that knowledge.

This mendicant is said to be 'accomplished in knowledge', and also
'accomplished in conduct', and also 'accomplished in knowledge and
conduct'. And, Ambaṭṭha, there is no accomplishment in
knowledge and conduct that is better or finer than this.

### 5. Four Causes of Quitting

There are these four causes of quitting this supreme knowledge and
conduct.[^344] What four? Firstly, take some ascetic or brahmin who, not
managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct, plunges into a
wilderness region carrying their stuff with a shoulder-pole, thinking
they will get by eating fallen fruit.[^345] In fact they succeed only in
serving someone accomplished in knowledge and conduct.[^346] This is the
first cause of quitting this supreme knowledge and conduct.

Furthermore, take some ascetic or brahmin who, not managing to obtain
this supreme knowledge and conduct or to get by eating fallen fruit,
plunges into a wilderness region carrying a spade and basket, thinking
they will get by eating tubers and fruit.[^347] In fact they succeed
only in serving someone accomplished in knowledge and conduct. This is
the second cause of quitting this supreme knowledge and conduct.

Furthermore, take some ascetic or brahmin who, not managing to obtain
this supreme knowledge and conduct, or to get by eating fallen fruit, or
to get by eating tubers and fruit, sets up a fire chamber in the
neighborhood of a village or town and dwells there serving the sacred
flame. In fact they succeed only in serving someone accomplished in
knowledge and conduct. This is the third cause of quitting this supreme
knowledge and conduct.

Furthermore, take some ascetic or brahmin who, not managing to obtain
this supreme knowledge and conduct, or to get by eating fallen fruit, or
to get by eating tubers and fruit, or to serve the sacred flame, sets up
a four-doored fire chamber at the crossroads and dwells there, thinking:
'When an ascetic or brahmin comes from the four quarters, I will honor
them as best I can.' In fact they succeed only in serving someone
accomplished in knowledge and conduct. This is the fourth cause of
quitting this supreme knowledge and conduct. These are the four causes
of quitting this supreme knowledge and conduct.

What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Is this supreme knowledge and
conduct seen in your own tradition?"[^348]

"No, Mister Gotama. Who am I and my tradition compared with the supreme
knowledge and conduct? We are far from that."

"What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Since you're not managing to
obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct, have you with your tradition
plunged into a wilderness region carrying your stuff with a
shoulder-pole, thinking you will get by eating fallen fruit?"

"No, Mister Gotama."

"What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Have you with your tradition
... plunged into a wilderness region carrying a spade and basket,
thinking you will get by eating tubers and fruit?"

"No, Mister Gotama."

"What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Have you with your tradition
... set up a fire chamber in the neighborhood of a village or town and
dwelt there serving the sacred flame?"

"No, Mister Gotama."

"What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Have you with your tradition
... set up a four-doored fire chamber at the crossroads and dwelt there,
thinking: 'When an ascetic or brahmin comes from the four quarters, I
will honor them as best I can'?"

"No, Mister Gotama."

"So you with your tradition are not only inferior to the supreme
knowledge and conduct, you are even inferior to the four causes of
quitting the supreme knowledge and conduct. But you have been told this
by your tutor, the brahmin Pokkharasāti: 'Who are these
shavelings, fake ascetics, primitives, black spawn from the feet of our
kinsman compared with conversation with the brahmins of the three
knowledges?" Yet he himself has not even fulfilled one of the quittings!
See, Ambaṭṭha, how your tutor Pokkharasāti has
wronged you.

### 6. Being Like the Sages of the Past

Pokkharasāti lives off an endowment provided by King
Pasenadi of Kosala. But the king won't even grant him an audience face
to face. When he consults, he does so behind a curtain.[^349] Why
wouldn't the king grant a face to face audience with someone who'd
receive his legitimate presentation of food? See, Ambaṭṭha,
how your tutor Pokkharasāti has wronged you.

What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Suppose King Pasenadi was
holding consultations with warrior-chiefs or chieftains while sitting on
an elephant's neck or on horseback, or while standing on the mat in a
chariot.[^350] And suppose he'd get down from that place and stand
aside. Then along would come a worker or their bondservant, who'd stand
in the same place and continue the consultation: 'This is what King
Pasenadi says, and this too is what the king says.' Though he spoke the
king's words and gave the king's advice,[^351] does that qualify him to
be the king or the king's minister?"

"No, Mister Gotama."

"In the same way, Ambaṭṭha, the ancient seers of the
brahmins were Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka,
Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamadaggi,
Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha,
Kassapa, and Bhagu. They were the authors and propagators of the hymns.
Their hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times; and
these days, brahmins continue to sing and chant it, chanting what was
chanted and teaching what was taught.[^352] You might imagine that,
since you've learned their hymns by heart in your own tradition, that
makes you a seer or someone on the path to becoming a seer. But that is
not possible.

What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? According to what you have
heard from elderly and senior brahmins, the tutors of tutors, did those
ancient brahmin seers---nicely bathed and anointed, with hair and beard
dressed, bedecked with jewels, earrings, and bracelets, dressed in
white---amuse themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of
sensual stimulation, like you do today in your tradition?"

"No, Mister Gotama."

"Did they eat boiled fine rice, garnished with clean meat, with the dark
grains picked out, served with many soups and sauces, like you do today
in your tradition?"

"No, Mister Gotama."

"Did they amuse themselves with girls wearing thongs that show off their
curves, like you do today in your tradition?"[^353]

"No, Mister Gotama."

"Did they drive about in chariots drawn by mares with plaited manes,
whipping and lashing them onward with long goads, like you do today in
your tradition?"[^354]

"No, Mister Gotama."

"Did they get men with long swords to guard them in fortresses with
moats dug and barriers in place, like you do today in your
tradition?"[^355]

"No, Mister Gotama."

"So, Ambaṭṭha, in your own tradition you are neither seer
nor someone on the path to becoming a seer. Whoever has any doubt or
uncertainty about me, let them ask me and I will clear up their doubts
with my answer."[^356]

### 7. Seeing the Two Marks

Then the Buddha came out of his dwelling and proceeded to begin walking
mindfully,[^357] and Ambaṭṭha did likewise. Then while
walking beside the Buddha, Ambaṭṭha scrutinized his body
for the thirty-two marks of a great man.[^358] He saw all of them except
for two, which he had doubts about: whether the private parts are
covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.

Then it occurred to the Buddha, "This student Ambaṭṭha sees
all the marks except for two, which he has doubts about: whether the
private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the
tongue." Then the Buddha used his psychic power to will that
Ambaṭṭha would see his private parts covered in a
foreskin.[^359] And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth
on his ear holes and nostrils, and covered his entire forehead with his
tongue.

Then Ambaṭṭha thought, "The ascetic Gotama possesses the
thirty-two marks completely, lacking none."

He said to the Buddha, "Well, now, sir, I must go. I have many duties,
and much to do."

"Please, Ambaṭṭha, go at your convenience." Then
Ambaṭṭha mounted his chariot drawn by mares and left.

Now at that time the brahmin Pokkharasāti had come out from
Ukkaṭṭhā together with a large group of brahmins and was
sitting in his own park just waiting for Ambaṭṭha. Then
Ambaṭṭha entered the park. He went by carriage as far as
the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the brahmin
Pokkharasāti on foot. He bowed and sat down to one side,
and Pokkharasāti said to him:

"I hope, dear Ambaṭṭha, you saw Mister Gotama?"

"I saw him, sir."

"Well, does he live up to his reputation or not?"

"He does, sir. Mister Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks completely,
lacking none."

"And did you have some discussion with him?"

"I did."

"And what kind of discussion did you have with him?" Then
Ambaṭṭha informed Pokkharasāti of all they had
discussed.

Then Pokkharasāti said to Ambaṭṭha, "Oh, our
bloody fake scholar, our fake learned man, who pretends to be proficient
in the three Vedas! A man who behaves like this ought, when their body
breaks up, after death, to be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place,
the underworld, hell.[^360] It's only because you repeatedly attacked
Mister Gotama like that that he kept bringing up charges against
us!"[^361] Angry and upset, he kicked Ambaṭṭha over,[^362]
and wanted to go and see the Buddha right away.

### 8. Pokkharasāti Visits the Buddha

Then those brahmins said to Pokkharasāti, "It's much too
late to visit the ascetic Gotama today. You can visit him
tomorrow."[^363]

So Pokkharasāti had delicious fresh and cooked foods
prepared in his own home. Then he mounted a carriage and, with
attendants carrying torches, set out from Ukkaṭṭhā for the
forest near Icchānaṅgala.[^364] He went by carriage as far
as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on
foot. He went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. When
the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side
and said to the Buddha, "Master Gotama, has my resident pupil, the
student Ambaṭṭha, come here?"

"Yes he has, brahmin."

"And did you have some discussion with him?"

"I did."

"And what kind of discussion did you have with him?"[^365] Then the
Buddha informed Pokkharasāti of all they had discussed.

Then Pokkharasāti said to the Buddha,
"Ambaṭṭha is a fool, Mister Gotama. Please forgive
him."[^366]

"May the student Ambaṭṭha be happy, brahmin."[^367]

Then Pokkharasāti scrutinized the Buddha's body for the
thirty-two marks of a great man. He saw all of them except for two,
which he had doubts about: whether the private parts are covered in a
foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.

Then it occurred to the Buddha, "Pokkharasāti sees all the
marks except for two, which he has doubts about: whether the private
parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue." Then
the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Pokkharasāti
would see his private parts covered in a foreskin. And he stuck out his
tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils, and
covered his entire forehead with his tongue.

Pokkharasāti thought, "The ascetic Gotama possesses the
thirty-two marks completely, lacking none."

He said to the Buddha, "Would Mister Gotama together with the mendicant
Saṅgha please accept today's meal from me?" The Buddha
consented with silence.

Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Pokkharasāti
announced the time to him, "It's time, Mister Gotama, the meal is
ready." Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and
robe, went to the home of Pokkharasāti together with the
mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread
out.[^368] Then Pokkharasāti served and satisfied the
Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods, while
his young students served the Saṅgha. When the Buddha had
eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Pokkharasāti took a low
seat and sat to one side.

Then the Buddha taught him step by step, with a talk on giving, ethical
conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so
sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation.[^369] And when the
Buddha knew that Pokkharasāti's mind was ready, pliable,
rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special
teaching of the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the
path.[^370] Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb
dye, in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma
arose in the brahmin Pokkharasāti:[^371] "Everything that
has a beginning has an end."[^372]

### 9. Pokkharasāti Declares Himself a Lay Follower

Then Pokkharasāti saw, attained, understood, and fathomed
the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became
self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher's
instructions. He said to the Buddha, "Excellent, Mister Gotama!
Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the
hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the
dark so people with clear eyes can see what's there, just so has Mister
Gotama made the Teaching clear in many ways. Together with my children,
wives, retinue, and ministers, I go for refuge to Mister Gotama, to the
teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth,
may Mister Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge
for life.

Just as Mister Gotama visits other devoted families in
Ukkaṭṭhā, may he visit mine.[^373] The brahmin boys and
girls there will bow to you, rise in your presence, give you a seat and
water, and gain confidence in their hearts. That will be for their
lasting welfare and happiness."[^374]

"That's nice of you to say, householder."[^375]
