[^190]: The Vedhaññās are not mentioned elsewhere; their
    name means "Marksmen".

[^191]: When this event is mentioned at [MN
    104:2.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn104/en/sujato#2.1), the Buddha
    is also in the Sakyan lands, but near the village of
    Sāma. Both texts tell the story of Cunda conveying the
    news via Ānanda at Sāma, which was presumably near the
    Vedhaññā's mango grove. It does seem strange that two
    distinct discourses are recorded from the same prompt, but then, why
    shouldn't the Buddha give more than one teaching on such an
    important topic? At [DN
    33:1.6.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#1.6.1) the Buddha
    is at Pāvā in the Mallian lands, and the discourse is
    spoken by Sāriputta there. Given the evident lateness
    of DN 33, this is a less convincing framework. A parallel to MN 104
    (MA 196 at T i 752c12) says he was in the Vajjian lands at the time;
    both Sakya and Vajji border on Mallā. Jain tradition
    holds Mahāvīra died after the Buddha, and it was at a
    different Pāvā in Magadha near Nāḷandā,
    perhaps the place known in Pali as Pāvārika's mango
    grove ([DN 11:1.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn11/en/sujato#1.2)).
    The earliest Jain source for Mahāvīra's death, the
    Kalpasutra, is, however, much later than the Buddhist sources, and
    does not say where Pāvā is. But it does say the events
    were commemorated by the rulers of Kāsī and Kosala, and
    the Mallians and the Licchavīs. The absence of Magadha
    and the presence of Malla sit better with the location of
    Pāvā in Malla rather than Magadha.

[^192]: While this description of the Jains might seem like sheer
    sectarian calumny, it is a fact that the Jain tradition is split
    into two sects, the "sky-clad" Digambara, whose male ascetics went
    naked, and the "white-clad" Śvetāmbara who wear an
    unstitched cloth. Jain tradition holds that the split occurred about
    a century later, in the reign of Candragupta Maurya.

[^193]: A slight on the movement whose signature virtue was
    non-violence.

[^194]: "With broken monument" (*bhinnathupe*) is used only in this
    context. When a great teacher or leader died, a "monument" was built
    to keep their memory alive. The breaking of a monument---whether
    physical or symbolic---was, in a way, truly killing them.

[^195]: Cunda took the time to complete his rains residence before
    conveying the news, reminding us of the speed with which news
    traveled in those days---slowly. \| Apart from the events described
    here, we hear of Sāma only once ([AN
    6.21](https://suttacentral.net/an6.21/en/sujato)). The topic there
    is the decline of the Saṅgha, hinting at a connection
    with these events.

[^196]: This harsh critique is repeated at [DN
    33:1.7.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#1.7.4), but not at
    [MN 104:5.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn104/en/sujato#5.1), where
    the Buddha's response focuses on his own community.

[^197]: Normally we find *vokkamma* ("having turned away") in the sense
    of straying from the Dhamma. But this passage shows the phrase is,
    in itself, neutral, as it is good to turn from a bad teaching.

[^198]: The Dhamma is primary, not the teacher. This is applied to
    Buddhism as well; for example, a student is expected to help a
    mentor who is falling away from Dhamma ([Kd
    1:25.20.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#25.20.1)).

[^199]: Compare [AN 1.320](https://suttacentral.net/an1.320/en/sujato).

[^200]: "Collected sayings" is *saṅgāhapada*. This is a
    unique term, but the sense seems to be that the process of gathering
    and organizing teachings is incomplete. I take the negative *na* to
    be distributed separately among the clauses.

[^201]: Compare [DN
    16:3.8.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#3.8.4)ff.

[^202]: One of the Brahmanical sages under whom the Bodhisatta practiced
    before awakening ([MN
    26:16.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn26/en/sujato#16.1)). Another of
    his enigmatic sayings is found at [SN
    35.103:1.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.103/en/sujato#1.2). When
    the Bodhisatta began his study, he first learned to recite the
    scriptures, and in these two passages we find examples of what those
    scriptures were.

[^203]: Sharp razors were known even in Vedic times (Rig Veda 8.4.16).

[^204]: This is a distorted reference to Bṛhadāraṇyaka
    Upaniṣad 1.4.7. There, the Self is said to be hidden in
    a body like a razor in its case. People do not see it
    (*taṁ na paśyanti*), for they only see the
    partial and incomplete functions of the Self, such as breathing,
    speaking, and so on. Seeing only the aspects, they do not see that
    each aspect is an expression of the one whole. This confirms that
    Uddaka was a Brahmanical teacher who was familiar with this passage.
    Similar phrases, but without the razor simile, are found at
    Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.23 and
    Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.12.1.

[^205]: "Recite in concert" is *saṅgīti*. Reciting together
    affirms the mutual teaching and ensures the correctness of the text.
    The implication is that the entire Buddhist community participates,
    but in the *saṅgīti* after the Buddha's death there
    were only monks.

[^206]: Here the Buddha outlines the topics to be recited, which are the
    main chapters of the Saṁyutta Nikāya.

[^207]: The "meaning" is the *attha*. Here we see the source of the
    *atthakathā*, which we translate as "commentaries", but
    which are literally "discussions on the meaning". Such discussions
    are undertaken through a civil and polite inquiry.

[^208]: Meaning and phrasing are interdependent, so care must be taken
    with both. Often it happens that when the phrasing slips, a new and
    unwarranted meaning is imputed.

[^209]: These are the four basic requisites for monastics, said to
    overcome defilements by usage ([AN
    6.58:4.1](https://suttacentral.net/an6.58/en/sujato#4.1), [MN
    2:13.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn2/en/sujato#13.1)).

[^210]: This repurposes the phrase used right at the beginning of the
    Buddha's first teaching, the Dhammacakkappavattasutta ([SN
    56.11:2.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11/en/sujato#2.3)). There
    he was persuading hard-bitten ascetics that he did not indulge in
    sensual pleasures. While the affiliation of those five ascetics is
    not stated explicitly, clearly their practices were similar to the
    Jains. And given the context, no doubt the Buddha has the Jains in
    mind here.

[^211]: Again echoing the first sermon ([SN
    56.11:3.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11/en/sujato#3.1)), here
    the Buddha places the *jhānas* where, in the
    Dhammacakkappavattasutta, he put the middle way. He uses a similar
    strategy at [DN
    28:19.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn28/en/sujato#19.2).

[^212]: Some meditation teachers warn of the supposed dangers of
    becoming attached to the pleasure of meditation. The Buddha's view
    was that the pleasure of meditation arises from letting go and leads
    to Nibbana.

[^213]: At [AN 8.19:3.1](https://suttacentral.net/an8.19/en/sujato#3.1)
    the ocean is said to be *ṭhitadhammo*, "naturally
    stable". Both places are glossed as *ṭhitasabhāvā*. It
    seems this is in reference to the fact that the Buddhist Vinaya is
    gentle and flexible. The Buddha was ready to alter and adjust
    details when circumstances required, yet the fundamental principles
    hold firm.

[^214]: As at [AN
    9.7:3.3](https://suttacentral.net/an9.7/en/sujato#3.3), etc.

[^215]: It is possible to remember the past, but knowledge of the future
    is restricted to inferences in specific contexts and cannot be
    predicted in general.

[^216]: The Buddha claims no gift of prophecy, unlike some other sages,
    but he knows that which matters.

[^217]: See [AN 4.23](https://suttacentral.net/an4.23/en/sujato) and
    [Iti 112](https://suttacentral.net/iti112/en/sujato).

[^218]: Here these questions follow on from the Buddha's acknowledgment
    of epistemological limitations. Not everything can be known, and if
    it is, it is not always useful to speak of it.

[^219]: In the Brahmajālasutta ([DN
    1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato)).

[^220]: The Brahmajālasutta describes the path to the end
    of these views in terms of understanding dependent origination
    through contemplation of contact in the six senses ([DN
    1:3.71.12](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#3.71.12)). The
    Buddhist path is integrated, so one part always implies the whole.
