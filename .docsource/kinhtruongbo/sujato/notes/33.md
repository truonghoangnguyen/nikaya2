[^308]: This is presumably Bharadvāja
    Bārhaspatya, the rishi ancestor of the
    Bhāradvāja clan, many members of which are encountered
    in the suttas. It is unusual to find him listed along with the
    primary Vedic gods. The Bhāradvāja verses are mostly
    collected in the sixth book of the Rig Veda, where they show a
    special devotion to the god Pūṣan.

[^309]: These deities appear nowhere else. *Puṇṇaka* is
    "full", *guḷa* is "lump", and *karatiya* is unclear
    ("bean-like"?).

[^310]: The *yakkha* Sivaka ("blissful, auspicious") helped
    Anāthapiṇḍika visit the Buddha ([SN
    10.8:1.12](https://suttacentral.net/sn10.8/en/sujato#1.12)); he is
    possibly to be identified with Shiva. \| The dragon king Mucalinda
    sheltered the Buddha after his awakening ([Ud
    2.1:2.2](https://suttacentral.net/ud2.1/en/sujato#2.2)).

[^311]: *Yugandhara* is the tutelary deity of the mountain of that name.

[^312]: *Gopāla* is "cowherd", an epithet of both Krishna
    and Shiva.\| *Suppagedha* (or *supparodha*) is obscure.

[^313]: "Shame", "conduit" (or "craving"), and "stupidity" seem like odd
    companions.

[^314]: A saying by Pañcālacaṇḍa at [SN
    2.7](https://suttacentral.net/sn2.7/en/sujato) is quoted by
    Udāyī and explained by Ānanda at [AN
    9.42](https://suttacentral.net/an9.42/en/sujato). He would appear to
    be the wrathful (*caṇḍa*) protector of the
    Pañcāla clan, but a Pañcālacanda appears
    as a brahmin teacher at Aitereya Āraṇyaka 3.1.6. \|
    Āḷavaka is the tutelary deity of Āḷavī
    ([SN 10.12](https://suttacentral.net/sn10.12/en/sujato), [Snp
    1.10](https://suttacentral.net/snp1.10/en/sujato)).

[^315]: *Sumana* is "Happyheart", *sumukha* is "Fairface".

[^316]: *Dadhimukha* is "Milkface", and in the Mahābhārata
    is a name of a dragon. \| *Maṇi* is "gem". \|
    *Māṇivara* is "fine gem", although the commentary takes
    this as two names. \| Dīgha is identified by the
    commentary with Dīgha Parajana of [MN
    31:21.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn31/en/sujato#21.1).

[^317]: *Serīsaka* means "of *sirīsa* wood",
    perhaps the tutelary deity of a forest.

[^318]: This discourse picks up from [DN
    29:17.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato#17.1), where the
    Buddha urges that the Sangha should gather and recite the Dhamma for
    the long lasting of the dispensation. There he lists the 37 factors
    of awakening, a standard early collation of practice-oriented
    teachings that are primarily collected in the Mahāvagga
    of the Saṁyutta Nikāya. This discourse is
    a late one, and appears to be an initial attempt to compile a more
    thorough list of the Buddha's teachings. The
    Sarvāstivāda version of the same discourse formed the
    basis of one of their seven Abhidhamma books, the
    Sangītiparyāya.

[^319]: At [AN 10.176](https://suttacentral.net/an10.176/en/sujato)
    Cunda asks about the purity of the western brahmins; at [DN
    16:4.13.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#4.13.5) = [Ud
    8.5](https://suttacentral.net/ud8.5/en/sujato) he offers the
    Buddha's last meal; at [Snp
    1.5](https://suttacentral.net/snp1.5/en/sujato) he asks about a true
    ascetic.

[^320]: The completion of a town hall was celebrated by a talk for the
    Sakyans [SN
    35.243:1.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.243/en/sujato#1.2) and [MN
    53:2.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn53/en/sujato#2.1). Such halls
    were community meeting places that played a central role in civic
    society and communal decision-making in democratic republics such as
    the Mallas and the Sakyans. The Buddha's participation is a sign of
    his support for their civic and democratic process.

[^321]: As at [DN
    16:5.19.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#5.19.2), the
    Mallas are called Vāseṭṭhas after the family lineage of
    their priest (*purohita*).

[^322]: The Buddha likewise mentions his bad back and invites another
    monk to teach in both the other suttas where he is first to teach in
    a new hall ([MN
    53:5.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn53/en/sujato#5.3), [SN
    35.243:3.4](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.243/en/sujato#3.4)), and
    also on the *uposatha* at Naḷakapāna ([AN
    10.67](https://suttacentral.net/an10.67/en/sujato), [AN
    10.68](https://suttacentral.net/an10.68/en/sujato)). These were all
    occasions when the community was sitting late into the night.

[^323]: As at [DN 29:1.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato#1.3)
    and [MN 104:2.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn104/en/sujato#2.1), in
    both of which the Buddha was in the Sakyan lands at this time.
    There, the news is conveyed to the Buddha by the novice Cunda.
    Perhaps he was confused with Cunda the smith.

[^324]: Sāriputta adopts the "Aṅguttara
    principle" of arranging teachings by number rather than the
    "Saṁyutta principle" of arrangement by topic. Thus this
    list of teachings has more in common with the Aṅguttara
    Nikāya than with the Buddha's original list of
    Saṁyutta topics. I note unusual or rare terms, but the
    references here are meant to be indicative rather than
    comprehensive.

[^325]: [AN
    10.27:10.5](https://suttacentral.net/an10.27/en/sujato#10.5), [AN

    4:1.2](https://suttacentral.net/kp4/en/sujato#1.2).

[^326]: This phrase is unique, but here *saṅkhārā*
    ("conditions") is a synonym of *āhāra* ("food, fuel,
    nutriment").

[^327]: The paucity of teachings of "one" reflects the fact that the
    Aṅguttara Nikāya Ones consists mostly of
    longer teachings that have been split into atoms to artificially
    create "ones".

    aggregates; it is discussed at [SN
    12.23](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.23/en/sujato). \| "Knowledge of
    non-arising" (*anuppāde ñāṇaṁ*) is the

    cessation is the middle, not an extreme. But [SN

[^341]: The "right way" is the eightfold path, the "wrong way" the
    opposite ([SN 45.21](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.21/en/sujato).
    "Surety in the right way" is mentioned often (eg. [AN

    the wrong way" seems to be found only in later texts. "Lack of
    surety" is impermanence. And elsewhere these are not said to be
    "heaps".

[^342]: Despite the explanation, and the prevalence of reading
    *kaṅkhā*, the commentary requires the
    Mahāsaṅgīti reading *tama*.

    refers to material phenomena perceivable by the eye. "Invisible and
    resistant" is a shorthand for material phenomena that are not
    perceivable by the eye, but which nonetheless impinge on other
    senses, such as sounds or smells. "Invisible and non-resistant"
    includes form perceived solely in the mind.

[^346]: The last item is elsewhere found only in Abhidhamma texts. A
    "trainee" is a noble one who has at least entered the path to
    stream-entry; an "adept" (*asekkha*) has completed their training;
    one who is neither is yet to begin.

[^352]: The "weapon of learning" is at [AN

[^356]: This threefold presentation of the process of absorption focuses
    on *vitakka* ("placing the mind") and *vicāra*
    ("keeping it connected"), looking closely at how they cease (see
    also [DN 34:1.4.7](https://suttacentral.net/dn34/en/sujato#1.4.7),
    [MN 128:31.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn128/en/sujato#31.4), [SN

    8.63:3.1](https://suttacentral.net/an8.63/en/sujato#3.1)). The
    standard *jhāna* formula focuses more on the refinement
    of feelings, from which perspective the first two stages of
    immersion here fall under the "rapture and bliss born of seclusion",
    while only the third qualifies as "rapture and bliss born of
    immersion". Thus Analayo describes the two descriptions' as
    "complementary perspectives on the same process of deepening
    concentration" (*Comparative Study*, vol. ii, pg. 739, note 263).
