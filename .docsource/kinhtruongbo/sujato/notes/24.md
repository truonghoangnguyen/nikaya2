[^1]: This late sutta satirizes the failings of Sunakkhatta in a fashion
    so broad that it borders on slapstick. The town of Anupiya is
    mentioned only here.

[^2]: The Bhaggava clan was descended from the ancient sage Bhagu
    (Sanskrit Bhṛgu). They received the gift of fire
    conveyed by Mātariśvan the wind from the god Agni (eg.
    Rig Veda 1.60.1). In Pali they appear as potters (eg. [MN
    81:19.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn81/en/sujato#19.3), [MN
    140:1.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn140/en/sujato#1.3), [SN
    1.50:11.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn1.50/en/sujato#11.2), [SN
    2.24:12.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn2.24/en/sujato#12.2)).
    Archaeologists refer to the strata around the Buddha's time as the
    Northern Black Polished Ware culture on account of the distinctive
    highly glazed polish that was achieved on the pottery of the time.
    This, together with the production of iron, marked a significant
    advance in the mastery of fire. Thus potters were no mere humble
    craftsmen, but leading technological innovators.

[^3]: Sunakkhatta's dismal spiritual career began when he met the Buddha
    in [MN 105](https://suttacentral.net/mn105/en/sujato). In [DN
    6:5.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn6/en/sujato#5.3) we learn that,
    after being ordained three years, he spoke of his limited success in
    meditation. The current sutta and [MN
    12](https://suttacentral.net/mn12/en/sujato) deal with Sunakkhatta's
    bitter criticisms of the Buddha shortly after his disrobal.

[^4]: A candidate for ordination is expected to go for refuge to the
    Buddha, and may be said to live dedicated (*uddissa*) to him ([Kd
    1:23.4.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#23.4.1)).
    Moreover, a noble disciple is unable to dedicate themselves to
    another teacher ([AN
    1.276:1.1](https://suttacentral.net/an1.276/en/sujato#1.1)). But
    when the Buddha called candidates to go forth, he spoke of practice
    rather than personal devotion: "Come, monk. The Teaching is
    well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end
    of suffering." ([Kd
    1:6.32.3](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#6.32.3))

[^5]: He makes a similar criticism at [MN
    12:3.8](https://suttacentral.net/mn12/en/sujato#3.8).

[^6]: There are at least eight spellings for this tribe, including
    *thulu*, *bumu* and *khulu*. Below we meet a member of the ruling
    clan of the tribe named *korakhattiya*. I propose that *kora* is "of
    Kuru" by way of secondary derivation; cp. Koravya as a regular name
    for the kings of Kuru. Thus *korakhattiya* is not a personal name,
    but rather "the aristocrat of Kuru". The name of the city
    *uttarakā* means "northern", and Kuru is indeed
    northern. Occam's razor would urge us not to assume the existence of
    an otherwise unknown tribe on such a dubious term when it can be
    explained more parsimoniously as an ancient misspelling of Kuru. The
    Chinese at DA 15 (T 1, 67a15) has ("white clay"), which does not
    seem to clear it up.

[^7]: This practice is further described, along with the "cow vow", at
    [MN 57](https://suttacentral.net/mn57/en/sujato).

[^8]: "Holy man" is *sādhurūpo* (cp. [Dhp
    263](https://suttacentral.net/dhp263/en/sujato), [AN
    6.54:26.1](https://suttacentral.net/an6.54/en/sujato#26.1)).

[^9]: *Alasaka* is otherwise unknown in early Pali. Sanskrit medical
    texts describe it as flatulent indigestion. This agrees with the
    subcommentary's *ajīraṇena āmarogena*
    ("indigestion"). \| In this sutta, the Buddha is depicted as making
    specific predictions about the future, whereas normally he does not
    and probably cannot. Rather, he makes conditional predictions that
    if such courses are pursued, such results will follow.

[^10]: The terrifying Kālakañjas are mentioned at [DN
    20:12.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn20/en/sujato#12.5).

[^11]: This whole passage is unprecedented in early Buddhism. If
    Sunakkhatta was indeed able to revive the dead with three punches,
    it would explain why he thought so little of the Buddha's powers.
    But the ease with which this information is obtained contrasts with
    the elaborate failures of Pāyāsi ([DN
    23](https://suttacentral.net/dn23/en/sujato)).

[^12]: Spellings for Kaḷāramaṭṭaka vary greatly.

[^13]: In these practices we see some examples of the vows or
    observances (*vata*) that Buddha rejected as "grasping at precepts
    and observances"

[^14]: A diet of pure meat is still undertaken today by certain would-be
    gurus.

[^15]: Compare the "vow of restraint in the directions" in the Jain
    Tattvārthasūtra 7.1.

[^16]: *Āsādimhase* is middle aorist plural. Below
    Sunakkhatta again refers to himself in plural, but as usual I render
    with singular.

[^17]: The Burmese reading *pāthikaputta* means "son of a
    traveler". However the commentary says Pāṭika (or
    Pāthika) was the name of his father.

[^18]: For *ñāṇavādo* ("one who speaks from knowledge") see
    [AN 9.38:3.3](https://suttacentral.net/an9.38/en/sujato#3.3), [AN
    10.24:2.1](https://suttacentral.net/an10.24/en/sujato#2.1), [MN
    26:15.7](https://suttacentral.net/mn26/en/sujato#15.7).

[^19]: "Ambiguous" is *dvayagāminī*, literally "two-going".

[^20]: *Apadāna* means "what has been left over, leavings,
    traces".

[^21]: This kind of elaborate display is commonly depicted in late
    texts, but is not otherwise found in early Pali.

[^22]: Compare [DN
    1:1.36.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#1.36.3). The
    following passage is largely adapted from the
    Brahmajālasutta.

[^23]: Text has *suññaṁ*, but this appears to be a mistake,
    since the mansion is no longer "empty" as Brahmā is
    already there. Follow [DN
    1:2.4.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#2.4.3), which lacks
    *suññaṁ*.

[^24]: This statement is not explicitly phrased as a question, but the
    Mahāsaṅgīti edition inconsistently punctuates it as
    one. It makes more sense in context, especially as a response to the
    initial question: *Kathaṁvihitakaṁ* ("How do you
    describe ...") ... *Evaṁvihitakaṁ* ("Is this how you
    describe ...").

[^25]: This is adopted from [DN
    1:2.2.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#2.2.1). These
    philosophers belong with the "partial eternalists".
