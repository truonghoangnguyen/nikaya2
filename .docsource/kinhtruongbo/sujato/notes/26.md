[^46]: *Mātulā* means "maternal uncle". This Magadhan
    village is mentioned only here and [Cp
    9:39.2](https://suttacentral.net/cp9/en/sujato#39.2).

[^47]: As at [DN
    16:2.26.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#2.26.1).

[^48]: Two parables on mindfulness expand this idea ([SN
    47.6](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.6/en/sujato), [SN
    46.7](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.7/en/sujato)).

[^49]: *Evamidaṁ* indicates entailment, as at [SN
    56.21:1.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.21/en/sujato#1.3), [MN
    73:13.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn73/en/sujato#13.2), [DN
    16:4.2.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#4.2.4).

[^50]: We have heard the story of the wheel-turning monarch
    Mahāsudassana in [DN
    17](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato). Daḷhanemi
    appears only here. His name means "Strong-rim", such being one of
    the characteristics of the Wheel. His story of renunciation shares
    much in common with that of Maghadeva ([MN
    83](https://suttacentral.net/mn83/en/sujato)).

[^51]: "Receded back" (*osakkitaṁ*): like a woman shrinking
    away from a man's unwanted advances ([DN
    12:16.12](https://suttacentral.net/dn12/en/sujato#16.12)).

[^52]: The same point of view is expressed at [Bi Pc
    21:1.4](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc21/en/sujato#1.4),
    where sex workers teased nuns, suggesting they enjoy themselves
    while young and ordain when old. The Buddhist position is that
    Dhamma can be practiced at any age.

[^53]: The signs of the renunciate predate Buddhism.

[^54]: "Inherited from your father" (*pettikaṁ
    dāyajjaṁ*) calls back to the four
    *satipaṭṭhānas* that for a mendicant are "the domain of
    your fathers" (*pettike visaye*). In both cases they are to be
    earned, not conferred by lineage.

[^55]: "The noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch" (*ariye
    cakkavattivatte*; this is locative singular). *Ariya* ("noble")
    qualifies "duty" (*vatta*), as it does in the title below,
    *cakkavattiariyavatta*, rather than "monarch". Normally *ariya* is
    reserved for those who have attained the Buddhist path, but here we
    might have a rare use of *ariya* in reference to Indo-Aryan (Vedic)
    culture. Compare the use of *ariyaka* for speakers of Indo-Aryan
    languages at [Bu Pj
    1:8.4.10](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/sujato#8.4.10).
    However, the commentary says it simply means "flawless" (*niddoso*).

[^56]: *Saṁvidahassu* is second middle imperative.

[^57]: *Pavattittha* is aorist middle. *(A)dhammakāra*
    ("(in)justice") doesn't seem to occur elsewhere in early Pali. It is
    found in Ja 513 and Ja 498, both times in the context of just rule.

[^58]: "Provide" (*anuppadeti*) is used elsewhere in the sense of paying
    back a loan ([AN
    3.20:3.5](https://suttacentral.net/an3.20/en/sujato#3.5)), serving
    honored guests ([SN
    7.2:2.6](https://suttacentral.net/sn7.2/en/sujato#2.6)), paying
    wages ([DN 31:32.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn31/en/sujato#32.2)),
    or a king supplying provisions for essential workers to do their job
    ([DN 5:11.8](https://suttacentral.net/dn5/en/sujato#11.8)). It is
    thus more about fulfilling a moral obligation of fairness than
    offering charity.

[^59]: Where the phrase "from time to time go to them" (*te
    kālena kālaṁ upasaṅkamitvā*)
    occurs elsewhere in the suttas, it is always followed by "ask and
    question" (*paripucchati paripañhati*). Here, however,
    the second verb is "you should learn"
    (*pariggaṇheyyāsi*).

[^60]: "Own ideas" is *sa-mata*.

[^61]: *Pabbanti* is unusual and probably unique in early Pali. It is
    related to Sanskrit *parvati* ("fill") and is explained by the
    commentary as *vaḍḍhanti* ("grow, prosper"). \| I
    assume *janapadā* ("countries") is a misspelling of
    *jānapadā* ("people of the country"), as *janapada* is
    otherwise in singular.

[^62]: "Military officers" (*anīkaṭṭhā*) would have been
    standing officers in the army. According to both the commentary here
    and Monier-Williams' Sanskrit Dictionary (*anīkastha*),
    it includes elephant officers, who would have stood at the head of
    the army. \| "Professional advisers" (*mantassājīvino*)
    is explained by the commentary as those who make a living from
    giving wise advice.

[^63]: Ensuring citizens have enough to live on is not merely a matter
    of kindness and common decency, but is crucial to ensure stability
    and national unity.

[^64]: The origins of theft are told at [DN
    27:19.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn27/en/sujato#19.1). The myth
    recounted here overlaps, with points of both similarity and
    difference.

[^65]: The king uses the same procedure as the Buddha. When presented
    with an alleged wrong-doer, the first thing is to ask them whether
    they did it.

[^66]: Simply providing money is not enough, nor is simply expecting
    that people can just work for what they want. They need something to
    get started, together with the support and opportunity to build a
    life for themselves.

[^67]: Sadly, bad faith actors take advantage of kindness.

[^68]: While the king's concern is legitimate, his overreaction
    escalates the problems.

[^69]: The violence of the state leads to an armed and violent
    citizenry.

[^70]: Today we can see that, even among developed nations, a degraded
    and violent culture leads to declining lifespans.

[^71]: *Paresaṁ dāresu*: both "others" and
    "wives" are in plural, so polygyny is assumed. Compare *parassa
    dāresu* ("the wives of another") at [SN
    55.7:6.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn55.7/en/sujato#6.3). Note the
    significance granted to beauty in influencing human society.

[^72]: At this point, the three factors of wrong action---killing,
    stealing, and sexual misconduct---are present, as are the four
    factors of wrong speech---lying, backbiting, harsh speech, and
    nonsensical speech.

[^73]: This completes the three factors of unskillful thought: desire,
    ill will, and wrong views (which are a strong form of delusion).
    Here wrong view probably means moral nihilism.

[^74]: These three terms recur in a similar context at [AN
    3.56:2.1](https://suttacentral.net/an3.56/en/sujato#2.1). The
    commentaries to the two passages give quite different explanations.
    \| "Illicit desire" (*adhammarāgo*) probably refers to
    any form of desire that is illegal or transgressive, such as incest,
    rape, or pedophilia. \| "Immoral greed" (*visamalobho*) implies
    excess and imbalance. Both are, however, explained in the commentary
    to [AN 3.56:2.1](https://suttacentral.net/an3.56/en/sujato#2.1) as
    desire for the belongings of others. \| *Micchādhammo*
    is hard to pin down. Its opposite, *sammā dhammo*
    always means "right teaching". The commentary here explains it as
    "men with men and women with women", but this must be rejected as
    there is no hint anywhere in early Pali (or elsewhere in early
    Indian culture) that homosexual relations were considered immoral.
    The commentary to [AN
    3.56:2.1](https://suttacentral.net/an3.56/en/sujato#2.1) explains it
    as "indulgence in what is reckoned an inappropriate basis"
    (*avatthupaṭisevanasaṅkhātena*). This implies
    intercourse with one of the women mentioned at [MN
    41:8.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn41/en/sujato#8.4), which includes
    those who are "protected by principle"
    (*dhammarakkhitā*). This sense of *dhamma* is explained
    at [Bu Ss
    5:4.2.16](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5/en/sujato#4.2.16)
    as "religion". Here I think the sense is similar: customs or beliefs
    that legitimize immorality.

[^75]: This brings us to the Buddha's present.

[^76]: Here the Buddha paints a devastating picture of societal
    collapse. Life expectancy as low as thirty years has been recorded
    in some countries in the 20th century.

[^77]: The age of onset of puberty has been dropping globally over the
    past century, with isolated cases as young as five.

[^78]: "Finger millet" (*kudrūsaka*; Pahari *kodra*,
    Garhwal *koda*) is a robust secondary grain in Asia and Africa,
    growing in places rice cannot. Due to its resilience in the face of
    global heating, 2023 was declared the International Year of Millets
    by the UN.

[^79]: The Buddha's father gave this luxury food to servants and staff
    ([AN 3.39:2.3](https://suttacentral.net/an3.39/en/sujato#2.3)).

[^80]: The narrative above traced the gradual disappearance of these ten
    factors. \| *Atibyādippissanti* is a unique term. At
    [AN 7.66:9.2](https://suttacentral.net/an7.66/en/sujato#9.2) a sign
    of the end of days is the "erupting" (*ādippanti*) of
    volcanoes, suggesting "explode" for the intensive form here.

[^81]: "Skillful" is *kusala*, otherwise translated as "good" or
    "wholesome".

[^82]: At [AN 2.9](https://suttacentral.net/an2.9/en/sujato) = [Iti
    42](https://suttacentral.net/iti42/en/sujato) the world is protected
    from this by conscience and prudence.

[^83]: For *sambheda* in the sense of "dissolving, leaking", see [DN
    3:1.15.11](https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato#1.15.11), [AN
    5.103:6.4](https://suttacentral.net/an5.103/en/sujato#6.4), [AN
    10.45:4.1](https://suttacentral.net/an10.45/en/sujato#4.1). The
    commentary here says "mixedness, breaking of boundaries".

[^84]: "Interregnum of swords" is *satthantarakappo*. Seven days seems
    optimistic.

[^85]: Dehumanization of the other is an essential precursor to
    genocide.

[^86]: "Let us neither kill nor be killed" (*mā ca
    mayaṁ kañci, mā ca amhe
    koci*) is an idiomatic phrase, the Golden Rule framed as a negative:
    "Let us not do unto others nor let others do unto us." It is
    explained by the commentary as, "Let us not take even a single
    person's life or let them take ours".

[^87]: *Sabhāgāyissanti* = *sabhāga* +
    *āyissanti* = "will come together". \|
    *Samassāsissanti* = *sama* + *sāsati* =
    "cry in one voice". The latter term is absent from some manuscripts.

[^88]: *Diṭṭhā* is Sanskrit *diṣṭyā*,
    "fantastic, how fortunate", per [DN
    16:2.24.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#2.24.5) and [Ja
    81:1.4](https://suttacentral.net/ja81/en/sujato#1.4). \|
    *Sattā* is nominative singular for *sattar* ("enemy"),
    not plural of *satta* ("being"), which disagrees with both verb and
    vocative in number.

[^89]: The first precept, and the first of the ten ways of skillful
    action. The Buddhist ethical principles are not just a part of
    Buddhist teaching, they are essential for the healthy functioning of
    human society.

[^90]: In the legendary past, too, only these three afflictions
    prevailed ([Snp
    2.7:29.1](https://suttacentral.net/snp2.7/en/sujato#29.1)).

[^91]: Ketumatī means "adorned with flags".

[^92]: Saṅkha is "conch shell".

[^93]: This is the only sutta appearance of the future Buddha Metteyya
    (Sanskrit Maitreya, meaning "one full of love"). He became a
    prominent figure in later Buddhism.

[^94]: Throughout, the Buddha is concerned to emphasize that the future
    Buddha will offer no more or less than his own teaching and
    practice. He wanted people to practice now, not to establish a cult
    of a future savior.

[^95]: The maximum number of monastics cited in the suttas is 1250 at a
    single gathering.

[^96]: This event is found in Bhaddaji's verses at [Thag
    2.22](https://suttacentral.net/thag2.22/en/sujato), expanded to a
    full story at Ja 264. The commentary explains *yūpa* as
    "palace", but Bhaddaji's verses clearly depict a sacrificial post,
    to which the animal would be tied for slaughter. Such posts are
    connected with the horse sacrifice, which establishes imperial
    power. This is but one aspect of the wheel-turning monarch to draw
    on imagery from the horse sacrifice. Here, of course, no horses are
    killed.

[^97]: *Ajjhāvasati* in this sutta means "reign" not
    "dwell" ([DN 26:2.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn26/en/sujato#2.5)).
