[^456]: As in [DN 4](https://suttacentral.net/dn4/en/sujato).

[^457]: This discourse is similar to [DN
    33](https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato); seventy items are
    shared between the two. Here Sāriputta teaches without
    prompting. The scheme is more rigorous; items listed according to a
    specific pattern, then the same pattern is amplified one by one. The
    constraints of this scheme mean that, while almost all the items
    listed here are found elsewhere, they are mostly not known by the
    name used here. This sutta seems a little later than [DN
    33](https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato), but such conclusions
    should be drawn cautiously; in at least one detail, the absence of
    the *asura* realm from the "lost opportunities", the passage here is
    earlier.

[^458]: The use of a verse to introduce the teachings is unusual.

[^459]: This echoes Chāndogya Upaniṣad 7.26.2,
    *sarvagranthīnāṁ vipramokṣaḥ*.

[^460]: Each number from one to ten follows this same scheme.

[^461]: Compare [SN
    3.18:8.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn3.18/en/sujato#8.2).

[^462]: Compare [SN
    16.11:12.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn16.11/en/sujato#12.2).

[^463]: Compare [SN
    22.48:2.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.48/en/sujato#2.2), but this
    is the five aggregates rather than contact.

[^464]: This term is only found in the Ratanasutta ([Snp
    2.1:5.2](https://suttacentral.net/snp2.1/en/sujato#5.2)). It means a
    kind of meditation that results in the realization of the Dhamma in
    this very life.

[^465]: See [AN 4.254](https://suttacentral.net/an4.254/en/sujato).

[^466]: The "unconditioned element" is Nibbāna, everything
    else is conditioned.

[^467]: With the addition of "rational application of mind" at [AN
    4.249](https://suttacentral.net/an4.249/en/sujato).

[^468]: [Iti 72](https://suttacentral.net/iti72/en/sujato).

[^469]: These three "portions" of knowledge are not found elsewhere, but
    compare eg. [SN 12.34](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.34/en/sujato).

[^470]: [AN 4.31](https://suttacentral.net/an4.31/en/sujato).

[^471]: Described as four "perceptions" at [AN
    4.179](https://suttacentral.net/an4.179/en/sujato).

[^472]: A different group of five factors of immersion is at [AN
    5.28](https://suttacentral.net/an5.28/en/sujato); the final factor
    is the same in both. The first four factors, however, appear only as
    part of this same group in later texts ([Ne
    21:5.1](https://suttacentral.net/ne21/en/sujato#5.1), [Ps
    1.1:246.2](https://suttacentral.net/ps1.1/en/sujato#246.2), [Vb
    16:342.2](https://suttacentral.net/vb16/en/sujato#342.2)).

[^473]: [AN 8.2](https://suttacentral.net/an8.2/en/sujato).

[^474]: At this point, [DN
    33:3.2.53](https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#3.2.53) has an
    extra possibility, rebirth among the titans, making nine in all.

[^475]: The negative is absent from the text due to abbreviation, so it
    is inferred from the parallel passage at [DN
    33:3.2.69](https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#3.2.69).

[^476]: [AN 8.30](https://suttacentral.net/an8.30/en/sujato). \| Read
    *nippapañcārāmassāyaṁ* per [AN
    8.30:3.11](https://suttacentral.net/an8.30/en/sujato#3.11).

[^477]: Similar sequences are found throughout the suttas, but this
    exact sequence appears to be unique.

[^478]: Four are found at [AN
    4.194](https://suttacentral.net/an4.194/en/sujato). Seven, phrased
    slightly differently, are found at [MN
    23](https://suttacentral.net/mn23/en/sujato).

[^479]: [AN 9.23](https://suttacentral.net/an9.23/en/sujato).

[^480]: [SN 14.9](https://suttacentral.net/sn14.9/en/sujato).

[^481]: [AN 9.93](https://suttacentral.net/an9.93/en/sujato).

[^482]: [AN 10.238](https://suttacentral.net/an10.238/en/sujato).

[^483]: The sutta, and hence the Dīgha Nikāya
    as a whole, ends with the qualities of the arahant, the one who
    completes the path and practice of the Buddha.
