# A Reader's Guide to the Pali Suttas

::: flushright
*Bhikkhu Sujato, 2019*
:::

The suttas of the Pali Canon (Tipiṭaka), especially the
four main *nikāyas*, are essential reading for anyone who
wishes to understand the Buddha and his teaching. They have been
preserved and passed down in the Pali language by the
Theravāda tradition of Buddhism as the word of the Buddha.

These texts were originally passed down orally, by generations of monks
and nuns who memorized them and recited them together. Around 30 BCE
they were written down in the Āluvihāra in Sri Lanka, and
subsequently were transmitted in manuscripts of palm leaves.

From the 19th century, the manuscripts were edited and published as
modern editions in sets of books. In addition, the Pali text was
translated into a number of modern languages, including Thai, Burmese,
Sinhalese, and English.

The word Tipiṭaka means "Three Baskets". The Basket of
Discourses is traditionally listed as the second of the three. The four
*nikāyas* make up the bulk of the Basket of Discourses.
Here is how they are situated within the canon as a whole.

- Vinaya Piṭaka (Basket of Monastic Law)

- Sutta Piṭaka (Basket of Discourses)

  - **Dīgha Nikāya** (Long Discourses)

  - **Majjhima Nikāya** (Middle Discourses)

  - **Saṁyutta Nikāya** (Linked Discourses)

  - **Aṅguttara Nikāya** (Numbered Discourses)

  - Khuddaka Nikāya (Minor Discourses)

- Abhidhamma Piṭaka (Basket of Systematic Treatises)

Similar collections are found in ancient Chinese translations, and
substantial portions of them are also in Sanskrit and Tibetan. The
diverse collections of scriptures arose among the Buddhist communities
who spread across greater India in the centuries following the Buddha,
especially under the Buddhist emperor, Ashoka. These missions are
documented in the ancient chronicles of Sri Lanka as well as the Vinaya
commentaries in Pali and Chinese, and have been partially corroborated
by modern archaeology.

SuttaCentral hosts almost all of these texts and provides comprehensive
parallels showing the relations between them. A comparative
understanding based on the full spectrum of these texts is essential for
any study of early Buddhism. The Chinese Buddhist canon, in particular,
contains a vast amount of translations of early texts, and in terms of
quantity it outweighs the Pali texts by some margin.

For many reasons, though, the Pali texts will always retain a special
place for those who wish to understand what the Buddha taught.

- They are the only complete set of scriptures of an early school of
  Buddhism.

- They are by far the largest body of texts to survive in an early Indic
  dialect.

- They are accompanied by an extensive and detailed set of ancient
  commentaries (*aṭṭhakathā*).

- They are, for the most part, linguistically clear, well-edited, and
  readily comprehensible.

Moreover, the Pali texts are the core scriptures of a living tradition,
the Theravāda school found in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar,
Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, India, China, and Vietnam. To this day they
are recited, taught, studied, and practiced daily, and are regarded in
the traditions as being a reliable witness to the teachings of the
Buddha himself.

Among the Pali texts, it is the four *nikāyas* that command
the most attention. It is here that we find extensive and definitive
explanations of Buddhist teachings, as well as the living personality of
the Buddha and his immediate disciples.

By comparison, the Vinaya Piṭaka details the life of the
monastic communities, and in addition it reveals much about the history
and social background; but it contains only a few teaching passages. The
Abhidhamma Piṭaka is made up of systematic treatises that
were composed in the centuries following the Buddha's passing. And the
books of the Khuddaka Nikāya are very mixed. There are six
fairly short books that are supplements to the main four
*nikāyas*, mostly in verse: the
[Dhammapada](https://suttacentral.net/dhp),
[Udāna](https://suttacentral.net/ud),
[Itivuttaka](https://suttacentral.net/iti), [Sutta
Nipāta](https://suttacentral.net/snp),
[Theragāthā](https://suttacentral.net/thag), and
[Therīgāthā](https://suttacentral.net/thig). However, most of the other
books in the Khuddaka are later, and represent a phase of Buddhism a few
centuries after the Buddha.

### About These Guides

I have prepared these guides in order to support a student who wishes to
develop a deeper understanding of the *nikāyas*. They
accompany my translations of the four *nikāyas* as found on
SuttaCentral. This general guide is meant to be read first, as it covers
a variety of issues that are common to all the *nikāyas*.
The four *nikāyas* are a highly unified body of texts,
sharing most of the significant doctrinal passages. The general
information presented here is fleshed out in individual essays on each
of the four *nikāyas*, which highlight the shifts in
emphasis and orientation from one collection to the next. These may be
read in any order. While the guides for the specific
*nikāyas* naturally focus on the texts in that
*nikāya*, this is not adhered to rigidly, and they may
refer also to passages found elsewhere.

Summaries of major doctrinal themes may be found mostly in the
*nikāya* guides, especially that for the
Saṁyutta Nikāya, rather than here. However, I
would urge a degree of caution when it comes to summaries, including my
own. The true joy of the suttas is in the undigested teachings, in that
raw moment when the Buddha encounters a person in suffering and helps
them, not by giving them a digested abstract, but by reaching out to
them as people. Summaries and surveys are best treated as starting
points for discovery, rather than as definitive treatises.

I almost completely avoid sideways glances at the various Chinese and
other parallels. Understanding these relations is critical, and the
entire basis of SuttaCentral is founded on this fact. But the number of
texts is very large, and the complexity of the subject is daunting. I
fear that if I were to deal with parallels in any kind of depth, these
essays would never be completed; and if they were, they would have
become unreadably complex. Hence I have set myself a more manageable
scope, sticking to the Pali texts, on the understanding that most things
probably apply to the parallels as well. The reader can easily check the
parallels on SuttaCentral if they wish.

Among students of the suttas, the names of these collections are often
abbreviated to "Dīgha", "Majjhima", and so on, just as the
word "Sutta" is often omitted from sutta titles. Strictly speaking, it'd
be best to use the Pali title when referring to the original text, and
the translated title when referring to the translation; but this
distinction is often overlooked.

### An Approachable Translation

In 2015 I determined to create freely available translations of the main
Pali discourses, so that all of these teachings might be made freely
available in a clear, consistent, and accurate rendition. My aim was to
translate the four main *nikāyas* as well as the 6 early
books of the Khuddaka Nikāya: Theragāthā,
Therīgāthā, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Dhammapada, and
Suttanipāta. I did this so that these astonishing works of
ancient spiritual insight might enjoy the wider audience they so richly
deserve.

In considering my translation style, I reflected on the standard trope
that introduces the prose suttas: a person "approaches" the Buddha to
ask a question or hear a teaching. It's one of those passages that
became so standard that we usually just pass it by. But it is no small
thing to "approach" a spiritual teacher. It takes time, effort,
curiosity, and courage; many of those people would have been more than a
little nervous.

How, then, would the Buddha respond when approached? Would he have been
archaic and obscure? Would he use words in odd, alienating ways? Would
you need to have another monk by your side, whispering notes into your
ear every second sentence---"He said this; but what he really meant
was..."?

I think not. I think that the Buddha would have spoken clearly, kindly,
and with no more complication than was necessary. I think that he would
have respected the effort that people made to "approach" his teachings,
and he would have tried the best he could, given the limitations of
language and comprehension, to explain the Dhamma so that people could
understand it.

An approachable translation expresses the meaning of the text in a
manner that is simple, friendly, and idiomatic. It should not just be
technically correct, it should sound like something someone might
actually say.

Which means that it should strive to dispense entirely with the
formalisms, technicalities, and Indic idioms that has dominated Buddhist
translations, into which English has been coerced by translators who
were writing for Indologists, linguists, and Buddhist philosophers. Such
translations are a death by a thousand papercuts; with each obscurity
the reader is distanced, taken out of the text, pushed into a mode of
acting on the text, rather than being drawn into it.

That is not how those who listened to the Buddha would have experienced
it. They were not being annoyed by the grit of dubious diction, nor were
they being constantly nagged to check the footnotes. They were drawn
inwards and upwards, fully experiencing the transformative power of the
Dhamma as it came to life in the words of the Awakened One. We cannot
hope to recapture this experience fully; but at least we can try to not
make things worse than they need to be.

At each step of the way I asked myself, "Would an ordinary person, with
little or no understanding of Buddhism, be able to read this and
understand what it is actually saying?" To this end, I have favored the
simpler word over the more complex; the direct phrasing rather than the
oblique; the active voice rather than the passive; the informal rather
than the formal; and the explicit rather than the implicit.

Still, it should not be thought that these are loose adaptations or
simplifications. There is a place for re-imaginings of ancient texts,
and for versions that strip the complexity to focus on the main point.
But my work is intended as a full and accurate translation, one that
omits nothing of substance. It is just that I try to express this
without undue complexity.

I still feel I am a long way from achieving my goal. No-one is more
aware than the translator of the compromises and losses along the way.
Consistency, clarity, correctness, and beauty all make their competing
claims, and only rarely, it seems, can all be met. It is a work in
progress, and I will probably be making corrections and adjustments for
many years to come.

I have been especially influenced in this approach by my fellow monks,
Ajahn Brahm and Ajahn Brahmali. It is from Ajahn Brahm that I have
learned the virtue of plain English; of the kindness of speaking such
that people actually understand. And with Ajahn Brahmali, who has been
working on Vinaya translations at the same time, I have had many
illuminating discussions about the meaning of various words and phrases.
He said one thing that stuck in my mind: a translation should mean
*something*. Even if you're not sure what the text means, we can be sure
that it had some meaning, so to translate it based purely on lexical
correspondences is to not really translate it at all. Say what you think
the text means, and if you make a mistake, fix it.

### Plan Your Route or Wander in the Garden

The Buddha's teaching is a graduated one, leading from simple principles
to profound realizations. This pattern is found within almost all of the
discourses in one way or another. However it does *not* apply to the
collections of discourses. From collection to collection or discourse to
discourse there is no graduation in difficulty, no build up of assumed
knowledge in the student.

On the contrary, the Dīgha Nikāya begins with
the Brahmajāla Sutta, while the Majjhima
Nikāya begins with the Mūlapariyāya Sutta,
both of which are among the most profound and difficult discourses in
the whole canon. A student who dives in unwarily will suddenly find
themselves in very deep waters indeed.

If we wish to build up knowledge step by step, we can't rely on simply
reading the suttas in order. Students often find it helpful to use a
structured reading guide such as that offered here. On SuttaCentral, we
offer several other approaches.

Having said which, there's nothing wrong with simply plunging in at
random, so long as you don't expect everything to make sense at first.
Take your time and enjoy wandering about. Don't worry too much about
things that seem odd or unexpected. Usually you'll find that obscure or
difficult ideas are explained somewhere else; discovering those
unexpected connections is one of the joys of reading the suttas.

In these introductory essays, you will find many references to the
suttas. You don't need to look up each reference to understand the
essays. But if you do, you will get a reasonable survey of many
important texts, and learn how to find the passage that you need. I
suggest reading each essay on its own first, and then a second time,
looking up and reading the sutta references as you go.

### Looking Up References

When you delve into sutta reading, you'll notice that texts and passages
are referenced in sometimes confusing ways. On SuttaCentral we employ a
simple and widely adopted form of semantic referencing. By "semantic"
references, we mean that the reference numbers are based on meaningful
divisions in the texts themselves.

For the four *nikāyas*, this means:

- In the Dīgha and Majjhima, texts are referenced by the ID
  for the collection (DN and MN respectively) and the sutta number,
  counted in a simple sequence from the beginning.

- In the Saṁyutta, the collection ID (SN),
 *saṁyutta* (thematic group), and sutta.

- In the Aṅguttara, the collection ID (AN),
 *nipāta* (numerical group), and sutta.

More granular referencing is provided by section numbers. These follow
pre-existing conventions:

- In the Dīgha, the section numbers of the PTS Pali
  edition, which have been widely adopted in translations.

- In the Majjhima, the section numbers introduced by Bhikkhu
  Ñāṇamoḷi, and used in Bhikkhu Bodhi's edition.

- In the Saṁyutta and Aṅguttara, the paragraph
  numbers as found in the Mahāsaṅgīti Pali text.

Each of these is further subdivided so that each section contains a
number of "segments", a short piece of text usually about a sentence or
so long. In my translations, the segments are matched with the
underlying Pali text.

In our system, the numbers following a colon represent the section and
segment numbers, that is, the subdivisions within a sutta. So, for
example:

- DN 3 means "the third discourse in the collection of Long Discourses
  (Dīgha Nikāya)".

- MN 43:3 means "discourse 43, section 3 in the collection of Middle
  Discourses (Majjhima Nikāya)".

- MN 43:3.7 means "discourse 43, section 3, segment 7 in the collection
  of Middle Discourses (Majjhima Nikāya)".

- SN 12.2:6.2 means "discourse 2, section 6, segment 2 in the 12th
 *saṁyutta* of the collection of Linked Discourses
  (Saṁyutta Nikāya)".

You may encounter various other referencing systems. In academic works,
texts are often referenced by volume and page of the Pali Text Society
(PTS) edition of the original Pali. This is a regrettable and clumsy
convention, since it binds references to a specific paper edition. I
hope it is swiftly abandoned in favor of proper semantic references.
However, the PTS volume/page numbers are displayed on SuttaCentral in
case you need to look up a legacy reference.

Traditionally, the texts were---and often still are---referenced the
long way: by *nikāya*, then *saṁyutta* or
*nipāta* and/or *paṇṇasaka* (as applicable),
then *vagga* and *sutta*. This system is helpful when using manuscripts,
as you can narrow your search step by step through the manuscript to
find what you need. On the web, or even in books, however, it is
unnecessary. Nevertheless, you can use the traditional navigation
structure in our sidebar if you wish.

### Elements of Structure

As students of Buddhist texts we are interested in the content, in
learning what the Buddha and his disciples had to say and how they
lived. However, due to the manner in which the texts are arranged, we
quickly discover that it's not easy to know how different texts relate
to each other. So while it may seem dry, it is worth spending a little
time to consider the *structure* of the texts.

Early Buddhist texts were organized, not for reading, but for oral
recitation and memorization. The overriding concern was to divide the
texts into chunks that could be memorized and recited together. Since
the texts were preserved in memory, they were largely "random access": a
skilled student could instantly recall a passage from anywhere in the
texts, without having to flip through the pages or look up an index. In
this way, the earliest system of organization is a little similar to how
we find information today through a search engine.

It follows from this that we cannot expect early Buddhist texts to be
structured sequentially like a modern book. But this does not mean that
the collections are random or chaotic. They follow their own logic,
which can be discerned if the texts are approached sympathetically.

Here are some of the structural or formal elements you will encounter in
the early Buddhist texts.

#### Imagery and Narrative

The suttas frequently employ an ABA pattern. A statement is made; a
simile is given; and the statement is repeated.

This formal pattern is highly effective in reinforcing learning. First
we get the basic idea. But abstract philosophical or psychological
statements are hard to understand and remember without any context, so
the Buddha illuminates his teaching with a simile. He ends by driving
the message home once again.

The range of similes in the suttas is truly astounding. The Buddha had
an uncanny ability to effortlessly summon an apt comparison from
anything that he saw around him. The similes also convey a great deal of
incidental detail regarding life and culture in the Buddha's day, and,
more importantly, they show how the Dhamma teaching makes sense in its
context. Most of the classic Buddhist images that are familiar today
trace their roots to similes used by the Buddha in the early texts.

Sometimes the similes are extended to a brief parable or fable.
Curiously enough, however, we rarely see the Buddha engage in
story-telling of any length.

Where narratives are developed in some detail, they are typically as
part of the background story (*nidāna*) rather than in the
Buddha's teaching as such. It is an elementary principle of historical
scholarship that the background story is of a somewhat later date than
the main doctrinal material. Such stories vary considerably in the
parallels, showing that the traditions treated narrative more flexibly
than doctrine.

#### Repetition

It won't take long before you notice that the suttas tend to be
repetitious. *Very* repetitious. This can be a major hurdle for a new
reader, so let's take a little time to consider what is happening.

Like so many patterns found in nature, the repetitions are *fractal*.
That is, they occur at every level: the word, the phrase, the sentence,
the paragraph, the passage, the whole text, even the group of texts.
This shows that the repetition is not something alien to these texts,
not something forced on them by an over-zealous editor, but is intrinsic
from the beginning.

But why? The thing to remember is that the texts were formed in an oral
tradition. And in an oral tradition, repetition works very differently
than it does in writing. When you *read* a repetition, it can be
annoying; it feels like a waste of time, and you want to skip over it.
But when *reciting*, repetition has exactly the opposite effect. It is
soothing and relaxing. The parts that are different take more work, you
have to exercise your memory; but when the repeated passage comes
around---like the chorus of a song---you relax into the flow of the
chanting. Repetitions give the reciter space to be at ease and
contemplate. Reciting a highly repetitive text becomes a form of
meditation, where you reflect the meaning and apply it to your
experience as you recite.

But in addition to this spiritual aspect, repetition has a definite
practical purpose: preservation. By saying the same thing again and
again, identically or with small variations, the reciters were
constantly checking their memories, ensuring the accuracy of the texts.
And if a text was lost, there is always another similar passage
somewhere else. Thus the repetitions ensured the long-term survival of
the Dhamma by creating backups of important information in multiple
places, retained in the minds of Buddhist practitioners.

Understanding the historical role of repetitions, however, doesn't help
us when we just want to read a sutta. What are we to do? Well, there is
no single way to read a sutta. Some people prefer to read them in full,
contemplating each repetition. Others read them more briefly, getting to
the important point. You'll figure out a way that suits you. But when
you understand the role of repetitions, hopefully you will not find them
such an obstruction.

#### Abbreviation

The flipside of repetition is abbreviation. Since the repetitions are so
abundant, they are often abbreviated. Such abbreviation is not a modern
invention; it is found throughout the manuscripts, and indeed there is
no edition that fully spells out all the repetitions. The Pali texts
have their own convention for indicating abbreviations, marked with the
syllable *pe*, itself an abbreviation of *peyyāla*.

Generally speaking, the abbreviations in the Pali editions, and the
occasional instructions on how to spell out the full text, are sensible
and fairly consistent between editions. Modern translations follow the
manuscript tradition, but not slavishly. Sometimes the translation will
spell out abbreviated passages, or else abbreviate passages spelled out
in the original.

Abbreviations are both "internal" or "external". By internal
abbreviation, I mean that there is enough information in the text itself
to fully reconstruct it. Typically only the first and last items in a
list are spelled out in full, and for the rest, only the key terms are
mentioned. Here is an example from [SN
22.137](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.137):

> Form is impermanent; you should give up desire for it. Feeling ...
> Perception ... Choices ... Consciousness is impermanent; you should
> give up desire for it.

In external abbreviations, an abbreviated passage cannot be fully
reconstructed from the context, but requires looking up another text to
fill in the blanks. This is another example of how the oral tradition
differs from written texts. A reciter would obviously know, say, the
formula for the four noble truths, so there is no need to write it every
time; just enough to jog the memory. But in modern editions, especially
on the web, a reader can access a specific text from anywhere, and may
never have encountered the abbreviated passage before. For this reason I
tried to reduce the number of external abbreviations in my translations.

#### Titles

Buddhist manuscripts rarely have titles at the start like modern texts.
Rather, the title is recorded at the end. In modern editions, these
titles have been added at the start for clarity.

In many cases, especially in the titles of suttas and *vaggas*, what we
actually have in the manuscript is not really a title as such, but a key
word found in the summary verse (*uddāna*) found at the end
of a *vagga* or other division. These verses were inserted by the
redactors of the canon in order to help keep the contents organized,
much like a Table of Contents. However, the summary verses do vary to
some extent between editions, so the titles of suttas are not always
consistent. In addition, some suttas are assigned more than one title in
the text itself---for example [DN 1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1) *The
Prime Net* (*Brahmajālasutta*)---or there are spelling
variations. So take care, for it is quite common to find different
titles for the same text.

#### Textual Divisions

##### Vagga ("Chapter")

The *vagga* is the most widespread and distinctive structural unit in
early Buddhist texts. It usually consists of ten texts, which may be ten
discourses, ten verses, ten rules, and so on. The number ten is adhered
to fairly consistently, although on occasion a *vagga* may contain more
or less than ten.

The *vagga* is often little more than a convenient grouping to help
organize the discourses neatly. In such cases, a *vagga* is usually just
named after its first discourse.

However, it is also common to find that a *vagga* collects discourses
with a loose thematic unity. For example, in the [Chapter on the Full
Spectrum of Ethics](https://suttacentral.net/dn-silakkhandhavagga)
(*Sīlakkhandhavagga*) of the Dīgha
Nikāya (thirteen discourses in this case), almost all the
texts deal with the "gradual training" of ethics, meditation, and
wisdom.

In some cases, a *vagga* in Pali may parallel a similar *vagga* in
another language. For example, the famous [Chapter of the
Eights](https://suttacentral.net/snp-atthakavagga)
(*Aṭṭhakavagga*) of the Sutta Nipāta exists in
Chinese translation, though the Sutta Nipāta as a whole
does not. Similarly, the *Sīlakkhandhavagga* of the
Dīgha Nikāya has parallels in both the
Dharmaguptaka (Chinese) and Sarvāstivāda (Sanskrit) texts
of the Dīgha.

Occasionally the word *vagga* is applied to a larger textual unit, one
that includes a number of sections, each of which composed of "little"
*vaggas*. Examples of such nested *vagga* structures include the
Saṁyutta Nikāya and the Khandhakas of the Pali
Vinaya.

##### Paṇṇāsaka ("Fifty")

The word *paṇṇāsa* means "fifty", and a
*paṇṇāsaka* is a group of approximately fifty suttas, or
five *vaggas*. It is used to organize collections that contain many
*vaggas*. Most of the collections with large numbers of discourses use
this structure, for example the "[Root
Fifty](https://suttacentral.net/mn-mulapannasa)" of the Majjhima
Nikāya (*Mūlapaṇṇāsa*). The
*paṇṇāsaka* is purely for convenience and does not
correspond to any meaningful division of the text.

##### Nipāta ("Group")

The literal meaning of *nipāta* is "fallen down", and it is
a generic term for texts that have been placed together. In the
Aṅguttara, it is used for each division of texts gathered
together by number: the [group of discourses consisting of one
item](https://suttacentral.net/an1), and so on. Elsewhere it is used,
for example, in the title of the [Sutta
Nipāta](https://suttacentral.net/snp" class="text-root), the "Group of
Discourses".

##### Saṁyutta ("Collection of Linked Discourses")

Whereas the *nipāta* is quite generic, the
*saṁyutta* has a more specific meaning: texts collected
according to a similar theme or subject matter. The
Saṁyutta Nikāya consists of 56 such
collections. For example, the fourteenth *saṁyutta*
contains [39 discourses on the topic of the
elements](https://suttacentral.net/sn14).

##### Nikāya or Āgama ("Division")

The largest structural unit, usually known as *nikāya* in
the Pali tradition of the Theravāda, and as
*āgama* in the northern traditions. However, the term
*āgama*, while it has fallen into disuse in modern
Theravāda, is found quite commonly in the Pali
commentaries.

Collections similar to the four *nikāyas* as found in the
Pali are found in all the other schools. However, while the overall
nature of the collections is similar, and they are organized in similar
ways, the detailed content varies considerably. It frequently happens
that a sutta found in the Majjhima of one school, for example, may be
found in the Saṁyutta or Dīgha of another
school. In addition, the internal sequence of texts is quite different.
Thus it seems that the *nikāyas* or *āgamas*
functioned more as organizational guidelines than as fixed units.

The fifth Pali *nikāya*, the Khuddaka Nikāya,
is more flexible and varies more between traditions. It seems it
originated as a place for collecting verses and minor texts not gathered
elsewhere. However the Pali collection became a handy place to include
later texts, so it has now become the biggest of all the
*nikāyas*. While there are occasional references to a
similar collection in the northern schools, none exist in that form
today. Nevertheless, many of the individual texts of the Khuddaka have
parallels, especially the Dhammapada, which survives in many different
editions.

### In the Buddha's Day: A Time of Change

Each discourse begins with a brief statement saying that at "one time"
the Buddha was staying at a particular place. In this way the redactors
of the texts were concerned to locate the Buddha and his teachings in a
specific historical and cultural context. Modern scholars have been able
to reconstruct a fairly reliable picture of the Buddha's life and times,
relying on the early Buddhist texts, as well as what information may be
gleaned from Brahmanical and Jaina scriptures.

Archeology is, unfortunately, of limited use, as there are few
archeological remnants from the Buddha's day. In fact, before the time
of Ashoka---perhaps 150 years after the Buddha---there are very few
remains at all of ancient India, until the time of the Indic Valley
civilization, many centuries earlier. For the period we are interested
in, what has been found consists of some pottery and similar small
implements, as well as a few remnants of fortifications around
Kosambī. The paucity of evidence is due to two main
reasons. The first is that buildings at the time were mostly of wood or
other perishable materials. And the second is that archeological work in
India has been very spotty and incomplete.

The Buddha lived in the 5th century BCE in the Ganges plain in northern
India. The exact dates of his birth and death are uncertain, but modern
scholarly opinion tends to place his birth around 480 BCE and his death
80 years later at around 400 BCE. He was born in Lumbini and grew up in
Kapilavatthu, both of which belong to the Sakyan republic, straddling
the modern border of India and Nepal. His family name was Gotama; the
earliest texts do not mention his personal name, but tradition says it
was Siddhattha.

After his Awakening, the Buddha traveled about the Gangetic plain. The
area he traversed was part of the cultural/political region known as the
"sixteen nations" (*janapada*). This spanned from modern Delhi to the
north-west, the Bangladesh border to the east, the Himalayan foothills
to the north, the Deccan to the south, and Ujjain to the south-west.
Most of his time was spent around the cities of Sāvatthī in
the kingdom of Kosala and Rājagaha in the kingdom of
Magadha. Despite the proliferation of local legends in most Buddhist
countries, the Buddha never ventured outside this area.

It was not just the Buddha who was restricted to this region. It seems
that trade and other close cultural contacts normally took place within
this region, too. Occasional references to places further
afield---southern India or the Greeks---were vague and often legendary.
It was in the century after the Buddha passed away that the kingdoms of
northern India were unified and regular international trade routes were
opened, first to Europe, and, a couple of centuries later, to south-east
Asia and China.

### Economics and Politics

Though cities and urban life feature prominently in the texts, they are
still on a small scale. The economy was largely rural, with farming
playing a prominent role.

However there are lists of occupations in the Pali canon that show a
diverse range of employment---accountants, jewelers, builders, soldiers,
doctors, government officials, and many more.

The rise in diversity of employment was linked to the growth of cities,
which in turn is associated with the appearance of new technologies. The
archeological record, though thin, has furnished us with records of two
significant innovations: forges for iron, and a kind of fine pottery
known as Northern Black Polished Ware. These new developments attest to
a growing mastery in the industrial use of fire, something that the
suttas mention in several memorable similes.

Technological innovation drove economic growth. We frequently hear of
wealthy individuals, employing large staffs and managing properties or
businesses. There was enough economic surplus to support a large class
of spiritual seekers. Such ascetics made no material contributions to
society; their value lay in spiritual and ethical development.

These technological and economic shifts were mirrored in the political
sphere. There were two major forms of governance. Traditional clans such
as the Sakyans or the Vajjians followed an ancient restricted form of
democracy, where decisions were made in a town council, and the clan
elected a leading member as temporary ruler. Other nations, like Kosala
and Magadha, had formed a more familiar kind of kingdom, with an
absolute hereditary monarch. While the Buddha evidently favored the
democratic ideals under which he grew up, and after which he modeled the
governance of the Sangha, it was the kingdoms that were growing in
economic and military dominance. During the Buddha's lifetime, there
were repeated skirmishes between Kosala and Magadha, vying for dominion
over the ancient sacred city of Varanasi.

Of even greater significance, towards the end of his life, Magadha was
announcing its intentions to invade the Vajjian republic. History
attests to the success of this policy: in the decades following the
Buddha's death, Magadha conquered virtually all of the sixteen nations,
establishing an unquestioned supremacy over the region, and establishing
pan-Indian trade networks. So powerful was the resulting kingdom that
Alexander the Great's troops rebelled at the mere rumor of Magadhan
military might.

### Social Life

The growing complexity of economic and political life required
corresponding changes in social roles and responsibilities. Like any
society in a time of change, people in the time of the Buddha were
trying to balance their traditional values and structures with the new
realities. It seems that people were for the most part reasonably well
off. Still, poverty and famine, along with injustice, banditry, and
economic uncertainty, were present and posed a very real threat. We hear
frequent laments about how unpredictable wealth is, whether the older
forms of wealth in cattle and land, or the newer forms in money and
career.

The Buddha was not a social revolutionary and did not overtly agitate
for an overthrow of social systems, even those he recognized as unjust.
Typically he would argue for a more just and fair implementation of
existing norms. For example, rather than saying all societies should be
democratic, he spoke of the moral duty of a king to look after his
people.

A man was expected to earn a living so as to maintain and protect his
family. He should use his earnings to provide his family with both
essentials and luxuries, and to treat workers with kindness and decency,
while not neglecting to assign some funds for savings, and some for
donations to charity.

A woman's traditional role was to marry and bear children. Aside from
this, her options were limited. We rarely hear of professional women
aside from sex workers. In this context, the opportunity to become a nun
allowed women to pursue their own spiritual and intellectual
development, to act as leaders and teachers, and to be respected and
supported in that role.

Many of the more extreme manifestations of sexual discrimination are not
found in the early texts. We find no mention of child brides, immolation
of widows, or the essential subjugation of women to men.

India had not yet developed a full-fledged caste system. But there was a
much simpler fourfold division of society:

Aristocrats (*khattiya*)

:   Owners of land (*khetta*), typically wealthy and powerful, engaged
    in statecraft, war, and production. The Buddha was from an
    aristocratic clan. The aristocrats placed themselves at the highest
    tier of society.

Brahmins (*brāhmaṇa*)

:   Members of a hereditary priestly class. The brahmins were custodians
    of sacred texts called "Vedas", and performed rituals and ceremonies
    to their various deities. However by the time of the Buddha many
    brahmins were simply engaged in ordinary worldly livelihoods and
    their religious role was secondary. They believed themselves to be
    the children of God (Brahmā).

Merchants (*vessa*):

:   Engaged in trade and commerce.

Workers (*sudda*)

:   Performed physical labor.

Not everyone fit into this neat scheme. We hear reference to outcastes
and various tribal peoples. In addition, there were slaves or bonded
servants. Finally, the ascetics (*samaṇa*) such as the
Buddha saw themselves as having left behind all such notions of caste.

### The Many Spiritual Paths of Ancient India

Change in the Buddha's day was not limited to the worldly sphere. The
religious life of ancient India was equally dynamic. For this reason it
would be a mistake to assume that India in the time of the Buddha was
primarily a Hindu society. Some of the elements that make up modern
Hinduism may be discerned, but Indian religion, like spiritual and
religious practice everywhere, has always been in a state of flux and
evolution.

In the time of the Buddha, and indeed even to this day, the ancient
pre-Buddhist Vedas formed the basis for the spiritual life of the
brahmins and those who followed them. Rituals such as the *agnihotra*,
the daily pouring of ghee onto the fire as an offering to the fire-god
Agni---originated long before the Aryan people even came to India, and
continue to be performed today.

Nevertheless, many of the old gods featured in the Vedas had vanished by
the time of the Buddha, and many of the famed deities of later Hinduism
had not yet appeared. Those who do appear take on a markedly different
aspect; prominent gods such as Vishnu (Pali: *Veṇhu*) or
Shiva (Pali: *Siva*) appear in minor roles, and a warrior like Sakka
(AKA Indra) appears as an apostle of peace. There were no temples, no
images, and no cult of devotion (*bhakti*). There is no mention of a
system of *avatars*, nor of familiar concepts from modern Hindu-inspired
spirituality such as *śakti*, *kuṇḍalinī*,
chakras, or yoga exercises.

Moreover, when we look at the aspects of modern Hinduism that were
present at the time, many of them are completely separate from each
other. No-one considered, for example, the worship of a local dragon
(*nāga*) to have anything to do with the rites of the
brahmins. The outstanding feature of Hinduism---the great synthesis of
religious and philosophical ideas and practices, from simple animism to
profound non-dualism---had not yet been undertaken. Different strands of
religious life were quite distinct and were not considered to be part of
the same path.

Thus historians do not refer to the brahmanical religion of the time as
Hinduism, but rather as Vedism or Brahmanism. It was nearly a thousand
years later that the movement recognizable as modern Hinduism became
prominent in India. To be sure, much of Hinduism is drawn from the
Vedas, in the same way that much of Catholicism is drawn from the Hebrew
scriptures that Christians call the Old Testament. But were you to meet
Abraham or Noah and address them as "Catholics", they would not know
what you are talking about. And the Indians of the Buddha's time would
have been equally unfamiliar with the very idea of "Hinduism".

All this notwithstanding, there is an oft-repeated claim to the effect
that the Buddha "was born, lived, and died a Hindu", attributed to the
great pioneer of Indology, Thomas Rhys Davids. While it is true that he
did write this, it was in an early work, page 116 of *Buddhism: its
history and literature*, a lecture series published in 1896. But by 1912
his views had changed, for on page 83 of *Buddhism: Being a sketch of
the life and teachings of Gautama, the Buddha*, he said:

> Gautama was born, and brought up, and lived, and died a typical
> Indian. Hinduism had not yet, in his time, arisen.

Rhys Davids emphasizes that the Buddha did not have an antagonistic
relation to the Brahmanical religion. His purpose was not religious
reform, but freedom from suffering. However, on page 85 of the same work
he comments:

> In the long run the two systems were quite incompatible. ... Gautama's
> whole training lay indeed outside of the ritualistic lore of the
> Brahmanas and the brahmins. The local deities of his clan were not
> Vedic.

The lesson here is that we must avoid reading modern conditions back
into ancient times. The peoples of ancient India had their own rich,
complex, and many-faceted spiritual lives. We can only begin to
understand them, and to understand how the Buddha related to them, when
we set aside our modern preconceptions and preoccupations and listen to
what they had to say for themselves.

An outstanding feature of early Buddhist texts is interreligious
dialogue. The Buddha did not live in a Buddhist culture. We frequently
encounter the Buddha and his disciples discussing various aspects of
spiritual philosophy and practice with followers of other spiritual
paths, or with people of no particular path. Sometimes they would come
to the Buddha seeking to learn or even to attack. And it is not uncommon
to find the Buddha and his disciples actively seeking out followers of
other spiritual paths simply to engage in conversation. In this, the
early texts are quite different from later Buddhist literature, which
almost always consists of Buddhists speaking with other Buddhists.

While many of these people ended up declaring themselves followers of
the Buddha, this was not the purpose of the dialogue. The Buddha did not
debate simply to win an argument, but out of compassion, to help
alleviate suffering.

Amid the complex sets of religious practices, we may discern three major
domains.

#### Animism

In the villages and towns of ancient India, the most widespread folk
religion was a belief in the omnipresent reality of spirits in nature.
Such deities might embody aspects of the weather, or live in plants or
rivers or caves; they might promote abundance, or take ferocious and
threatening forms. They were unreliable, but could be wooed through
simple offerings of rice, flowers, or ghee.

Animist beliefs were derived from local legends and rituals, not from
religious philosophy. However, the higher religious paths such as
Buddhism or Jainism, rather than repressing such beliefs, were happy to
assign them a minor role in the scheme of things, so long as they
eliminated harmful practices like human or animal sacrifice.

Throughout the Buddhist texts, we hear of *yakkhas* (spirits),
*nāgas* (dragons), *gandhabbas* (fairies), *garudas*
(phoenixes), and many more. The Buddhist attitude towards such beings
might best be described as "good neighborliness". Neither they, nor any
higher beings, are worshiped or looked to for salvation. Rather, they
are treated with respect and dignity, for who knows? If they are real,
it would be good to have them on your side.

#### Brahmanism

The caste who called themselves "brahmins" inherited an ancient body of
sacred lore known as the Vedas. This consisted of sets of oral
scriptures, among which the Ṛg Veda was primary. In the early Buddhist
texts there are three Vedas: Ṛg, Sāma, and Yajur; the
Atharva is mentioned, but was not yet considered to be a Veda.

The Ṛg Veda grew out of the cultural and religious milieu of the ancient
Indo-European peoples. It shares a common heritage with the Avestan
texts of Iranian Zoroastrianism, and more distantly, the mythologies of
Europe.

It seems that Indo-European peoples moved into India around a millennium
before the Buddha, with distinct clans maintaining sets of sacred lore.
In the early centuries of the first millennium BCE, in the area known as
the Kuru country (modern Delhi), the clans were unified into the
classical brahmanical kingdom whose story is echoed in the
Mahābharata. The Ṛg Veda was forged from the books of the
clans, wrapped in opening and closing chapters emphasizing unity. By the
time of the Buddha, the brahmanical culture and language had already
become strongly established in the regions further south and east where
the Buddha lived.

The brahmins insisted on the holiness of their caste, the efficacy of
their rituals, the truth of their scriptures, and the omnipotence of
their deity. The Buddha rejected all these claims out of hand.

However, Brahmanical traditions were far from a unified monolith. We see
a strong strand of questioning of tradition, of seeking out new ways, of
earnest seeking of the truth; and such attitudes are just as strong in
the Brahmanical texts as the Buddhist.

Brahmins were typically family men, living a settled life, and expecting
a degree of social respect and standing due to their learning and caste.
But some brahmins had adopted an ascetic lifestyle, apparently
influenced by the *samaṇas*.

In the generations preceding the Buddha, brahmanical philosophy had
reached a peak in the Upaniṣads, with their sophisticated
debates and mystic philosophy of the essential unity of self and cosmos.
These texts form the immediate dialectical context of the Buddha's
philosophy. Yājñavalkya, a key Upaniṣadic
philosopher, lived around Mithilā, in the same region
traversed by the Buddha, no more than a century or two before him. Some
early Upaniṣads are apparently referred to in [DN
13](https://suttacentral.net/dn13) *The Three Knowledges*
(*Tevijjasutta*), and the Upaniṣadic doctrine of "self"
(*ātman*) was prominently rejected by the Buddha in his
most distinctive teaching: not-self (*anattā*).

#### The Samaṇas

Quite distinct from the brahmins, and often in opposition to them, was a
complex set of religious movements known as the *samaṇas*
or "ascetics". Six prominent ascetic schools were acknowledged in the
time of the Buddha. The Buddha counted himself as an ascetic, too, in
view of the many similarities between his own movement and theirs.

Like the Buddhist mendicants, the other *samaṇas* were
typically celibate renunciates, living either in solitude or in monastic
communities, and relying on alms for food. The most famous
movement---and the only one to survive until today---was Jainism, which
flourished under their leader Mahāvīra, known as
Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta in the Buddhist texts.

The ascetics shared an iconoclastic attitude, and all rejected the
brahmanical system *in toto*. However they varied amongst each other, as
shown in their teachings attested at [DN
2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2) *The Fruits of the Ascetic Life*
(*Sāmaññaphalasutta*) as well as [MN
60](https://suttacentral.net/mn60) and [MN
76](https://suttacentral.net/mn76). Some emphasized austerities and
self-mortification, others rationality and debate. Some advocated ardent
effort, others a resigned fatalism. Some taught rebirth, while others
asserted that this material world was the only reality.

While their doctrines may appear florid and obscure, and their practices
sometimes bizarre and pointless, the ascetic movements are a lasting
testament to the diversity, vigor, and innovation of religious life in
ancient India.

### Cosmology

A recurring theme in many of the religious strands of India is a concern
for cosmology. A religious philosophy was expected to paint a picture of
the world on a large scale and indicate humanity's role within it. Like
all aspects of religious life, such cosmologies were partly shared
across traditions and in part were unique to each tradition.

Some traditions asserted a materialist cosmology, rejecting the notion
that one would be reborn in any other state, and asserting that only
this life was real.

Most cosmologies, however, posited multiple realms of existence. Beings
would come and go from these different stations. Some were pleasant and
desirable, while others were not. As to why this was so, different
reasons were given.

- Some ascetics argued that beings transmigrated due to destiny or
  chance.

- Mainstream Brahmanical traditions said it was due to the performance
  of rituals and sacrifices to the gods.

- Some said that rebirth was determined by intentional actions, whether
  moral or immoral.

The latter view was held by some ascetic schools, such as Buddhism and
Jainism, and some of the more advanced and innovative threads of
Brahmanism. These traditions shared a conception of transmigration that
in many ways is quite similar. Three common elements can be discerned:

1.  All sentient beings are reborn countless times in process called
   *saṁsāra* ("transmigration").

2.  This process is driven by ethical choices (*kamma*). Good deeds lead
    to a pleasant rebirth; bad deeds lead to a painful rebirth.

3.  True salvation is not found in any realm of existence, but only in
    liberation from transmigration itself.

While these aspects of the cosmology were shared, the details differed
in both theory and practice.

Jain and Brahmanical theory proposed that transmigration was undergone
by a soul or self which could attain freedom. For the Jains, the
individual soul (*jīva*) attains eternal purity and bliss.
For the most sophisticated among the brahmins, the individual self
(*ātman*) realizes its true nature as identical with the
divinity that is the cosmos itself (Sanskrit: *tat tvam asi*; Pali: *eso
hasmasmi*; *so attā so loko*).

The Buddha rejected all such metaphysical notions of self or soul.
Instead, he explained transmigration as an ongoing process of changing
conditions, formulated as the famous twelve links of dependent
origination (*paṭicca samuppāda*).

In the practical application of their theory, Jains believed that the
way to salvation was to firstly avoid harming any sentient beings, even
unintentionally, and then to burn off past *kamma* through painful
self-mortification. Such practices are described frequently and in
detail, attesting to their prominence in early Indian spiritual life.

The brahmins, as seen in the suttas, did not have such a clear and
unambiguous path to a highest goal, and indeed are depicted as arguing
among themselves as to the correct path. This reflects the historical
situation, where the earlier, simpler, and more worldly goals of Vedic
Brahmanism were growing into a more sophisticated
Upaniṣadic form.

For the Upaniṣads, the key to salvation was understanding.
It is only one who understands the rituals and philosophies correctly
(*ya evam veda*) who will experience their full benefit. In the
centuries prior to the Buddha, this path of wisdom had developed into a
profound contemplative culture, expressed in the ecstatic and mystical
passages of the Upaniṣads.

The Buddha shared the Jain concern for avoiding harm, but rejected the
practice of extreme austerities. Rather than bodily torment, he
emphasized mental development.

Certain Brahmanical lineages had developed meditation to a high degree,
but meditative states were still conceived in metaphysical terms. The
Buddha adopted such meditations for their value in purifying the mind,
but interpreted them in purely psychological terms, rejecting
metaphysics entirely.

One of the benefits of advanced meditation was that a practitioner would
develop the ability to perceive many past lives and many realms into
which beings may be reborn. In this, we may distinguish between the core
doctrinal texts, which typically speak of rebirth in general terms as
good or bad destinies, and the narrative portions, which depicted the
realms of rebirth in terms familiar from popular Indian cosmology.

The early texts do not attempt to systematize these realms in any great
detail. Indeed, the various deities and realms mentioned defy any simple
categorization. Later Buddhism developed a theory of various realms,
sometimes called the 31 planes of existence, but this does not fully
represent the situation as found in the early texts.

Here is a general overview of the most important realms found in the
suttas. It is crucial to remember that, in the Buddhist view, all of
these, even the most high, are impermanent and do not constitute true
freedom. They are not separate metaphysical planes, but mere stations in
which consciousness may spend some time during its long journey.

Brahmā realms

:   The highest heavens, which correspond to attainments of absorption
    meditation (*jhāna*), and may only be attained by
   *jhāna* practitioners. The Brahmā realms
    include the realms of luminous form (*rūpaloka*) and
    the formless realms (*arūpaloka*). The former are
    attained by means of the four primary absorptions. In this context,
    the word "form" refers to the refined and radiant echo or reflection
    of the original meditation subject upon which these states are
    based. The formless states lie beyond this, and are realized when
    even that subtle luminosity disappears.

Heavens of sensual pleasures

:   Many of these are mentioned, most commonly the realm of the
    Thirty-Three, governed by Sakka. Various beings from Indian animist
    beliefs are said to inhabit the lower tiers of these realms.

Human realm

:   The most important realm, where Buddhas appear and the spiritual
    path is taught.

Lower realms

:   These include the animal realm, the ghost realm, and the hells. The
    realm of the *asuras*---titans or demons---is usually placed here in
    the later cosmologies, but the early texts seem to treat it as one
    of the heavens.

The Buddha taught that doing good and avoiding bad was the path to
rebirth in one of the fortunate realms, which include the human realm
and all higher realms. However, the course of transmigration is long and
unpredictable, so no heaven realm provides a sure refuge.

Far from teaching rebirth as a solace for naive followers unable to face
the inevitability of death, rebirth is depicted in traumatic and
terrifying terms: the tears that one has shed in the endless course of
transmigration are greater than all the waters in all the oceans of the
world. Thus the true significance of doing good deeds is not merely to
get a better rebirth, but to lay the foundations for higher spiritual
development, primarily through meditation.

In the core teaching of the four noble truths, the origin of all
suffering is traced to the craving that is connected with rebirth
(*yāyaṁ taṇhā ponobbhavikā*). The
practice of the noble eightfold path is the only thing that enables one
to let go of that craving and be free of suffering. This is what the
Buddha called "extinguishment" or "quenching" (Pali:
*nibbāna*; Sanskrit *nirvāṇa*).

### On the Pali Language

Theravāda Buddhist texts are written in Pali. This ancient
Indic language can be thought of as a simplified cousin of Sanskrit.
Here are some well-known words in both languages.

- Sanskrit *karma* is Pali *kamma*.

- Sanskrit *dharma* is Pali *dhamma*.

- Sanskrit *bodhisattva* is Pali *bodhisatta*.

- Sanskrit *nirvāṇa* is Pali *nibbāna*.

- Sanskrit *bhikṣuṇī* is Pali *bhikkhunī*.

Pali belongs to the Indo-European language family, which was introduced
to India perhaps a millennium or so before the Buddha with the
Indo-European (or "Āryan") incursions. It was subsequently enriched by a
large number of words adopted from local languages, primarily Dravidian
and Munda. Pali or closely related languages were used across the
greater Gangetic plain in the cultural and economic region identified by
the use of Northern Black Polished Ware.

Despite its great antiquity, Pali is a well studied and clearly defined
language. This is because the ancient Indians developed an advanced
science of linguistics, which is already mentioned in the earliest Pali
texts. Within a few generations of the Buddha, these were synthesized
and standardized by Pāṇini in his Sanskrit grammar, the
Aṣṭādhyāyī, a comprehensive technical treatise which is
perhaps the greatest intellectual achievement in the secular sciences of
ancient times. Pāṇini's methods were later adapted to
create Pali grammars, which remain the basis for the study of Pali to
this day. The Theravāda tradition has always prided itself
on its commitment to precision and care in matters of language and
scripture, with the result that the canonical Pali texts are, for the
most part, well edited, clear, and consistent.

Pali is a highly inflected language, which means that the forms of words
are adapted to indicate such things as gender, number, case, and the
like. This makes the study of Pali grammar quite intensive, but it also
helps in parsing out the structure of sentences.

The name of the language can be a little confusing. The
Theravāda commentaries say they are written in
Māgadhī, "the language of Magadha". For them,
*pāḷi* means "text", i.e. the canonical scripture as
opposed to commentary. In modern times, however, the language of the
Theravāda scriptures has come to be called Pali, while the
dialect of the Ashokan pillars is called Māgadhī. I follow
these modern conventions.

The historical origins of Pali are a matter of ongoing academic
research, which I will not go into here. Tradition holds that Pali was
spoken by the Buddha, and this is surely true in the sense that what he
spoke would have been closer to Pali than any other known language, with
the possible exception of Ashokan Māgadhī.

In my view, the least persuasive theory is that the Buddha spoke a
single consistent language all the time. This is so implausible as to be
virtually impossible; it's just not how language works. In ancient times
language was highly diverse, with different accents and dialects
sometimes from one village to the next. The process of language
standardization is slow and uncertain, and it is still common to adapt
languages per context. In Thailand, for example, it is normal for monks
from the north-east to speak to the villagers in their local Isaan
language---which itself varies regionally---and to visitors from Bangkok
in central Thai. In Malaysia, monks might switch between English,
Hokkien, and Mandarin in a single talk. Even those who know only one
language use context-switching all the time, adapting vocabulary,
accent, and grammar to accommodate speaking with people of different
classes, generations, or language communities.

This problem was addressed by the Buddha himself in the
Araṇavibhaṅgasutta ([MN
139:12.8](https://suttacentral.net/mn139)), and he could not have made
his policy more clear.

> "How do you not insist on local terminology and not override normal
> usage? It's when in different localities the same thing is known as a
> 'plate', a 'bowl', a 'cup', a 'dish', a 'basin', a 'tureen', or a
> 'porringer'. And however it is known in those various localities, you
> speak accordingly, thinking: 'It seems that the venerables are
> referring to this.'"

Unless the Buddha failed to follow his own advice, we can assume that he
adopted local dialects in his journeys, just as anyone else would. In
his travels from Nepal to the Deccan, from Bengal to Delhi, and in his
conversations with folks from all walks of life, from outcastes to
brahmins and kings, he would have used language that fitted his context.
This is more apparent in literary forms than in linguistic variation.
Verse forms in particular are strongly correlated with educated and
elite classes: deities, brahmins, and kings.

The language we call Pali has been standardized and streamlined to some
degree, while not eliminating all traces of its dialectical origins. I
think the specific features of Pali are likely to be influenced by the
language of Avanti, the home town of Mahinda son of Ashoka, who first
brought the texts to Sri Lanka. This historical problem is really of
most interest to linguists, since the differences between these dialects
are minor. Understanding of the dialectical situation can help to clear
up some tricky problems, but does not affect the vast majority of Pali
passages which are perfectly clear.

In modern times the study of Pali remains popular in
Theravāda Buddhism, and any serious student will pick up
some technical vocabulary. However, as my father used to warn me, "A
little knowledge is a dangerous thing." There are people who learn a few
terms and ideas and think this grants them the expertise to discard
2,500 years of sophisticated linguistic learning. Some even start their
own schools and teachings based on nothing more than silly linguistic
mistakes. I've been studying, memorizing, reciting, translating, and
teaching Pali for half my life, and I still learn something new most
every day. If you want to set out on the journey of exploring Pali, make
sure to stash plenty of patience and humility along with the curiosity
in your backpack.

Pali is written phonetically, which means that the way it is spelled
matches how it sounds. This has been the case since the beginning, as
even the first Indic script, Brāhmī, is phonetic.
Brāhmī, which is first attested in the Ashokan edicts,
became the source of all later Indic scripts, as well as those of south
and south-east Asia such as Thai, Sinhala, Lanna, Khmer, and Myanmar.
Over time, Pali came to be written in all these scripts.

These phonetic scripts were made possible by the linguistic science of
the ancient pandits, which precisely defined the value of each sound.
Despite this, the popular pronunciation of Pali varies from place to
place. This is because local Buddhist traditions use different
transliteration systems influenced by the national languages, and the
sound of letters in Pali does not always match the sound of the same
letter in the local language. Thus *buddha* in Pali is pronounced
*budda* in Sinhala, *phuttha* in Thai, and *booda* in American English.
Nonetheless, scholars of every nation are well aware of the correct
pronunciation.

In the nineteenth century, various schemes for representing Pali and
Sanskrit in Roman characters were developed. Scholars such as Sir Muthu
Coomaraswamy urged the adoption of a standardized Romanization so that
international scholars could easily read texts from the different
regions. Such a unified standard for transliteration of Sanskrit and
Pali was formalized in 1894 in Geneva at the International Congress of
Orientalists. This became widely used by international scholars, and
with minor emendations was adopted as ISO 15919 in 2001. Due to the
strictly mechanical nature of such phonetic representations,
SuttaCentral is able to show Pali texts in dozens of scripts, powered by
the Aksaramukha conversion utility.

The pronunciation of Pali is quite simple. The ancient grammars clearly
define the places and manner of articulation in the mouth. Vowels are
pure monophthongs, not dipthongs; that is, the sound remains fixed
throughout and does not glide while being articulated. Most vowels in
many varieties of English are pronounced with some degree of
dipthongalization, so native English speakers should train to remove
this by pronouncing each vowel with the mouth held still. With this
qualification, here are approximate vowel equivalents in English.

a

:   short: *lal* = "lull"

ā

:   long: *lā* = "lah"

i

:   short: *thil* = "till"

ī

:   long: *thī* = "tea"

u

:   short: *phul* = "pull"

ū

:   long: *cū* = "chew"

o

:   long: *so* = "so" (short before double consonants)

e

:   long: *jel* = "jell" (short before double consonants)

Consonants are all pronounced distinctly and not combined. The
twenty-five main consonants follow a systematic pattern: there are five
points of articulation in the mouth, and at each point there are five
possible letters varied by aspiration and voicing, as well as a liquid
consonant. In addition there are a few miscellaneous consonants.

guttural: back of the mouth

:  *k*, *kh*, *g*, *gh*, *ṅ*

palatal: middle of the tongue on the roof of the mouth

:  *c*, *ch*, *j*, *jh*, *ñ*

retroflex: tongue-tip curled to touch the roof

:  *ṭ*, *ṭh*, *ḍ*,
   *ḍh*, *ṇ*

dental: tongue touches the base of the teeth

:  *t*, *th*, *d*, *dh*, *n*

labial: at the lips

:  *p*, *ph*, *b*, *bh*, *m*

miscellaneous

:  *y*, *r*, *l*, *ḷ*, *v*, *s*, *h*, *ḷh*,
   *ṁ*

The only ambiguous sign is *h*. By itself or when following most soft
consonants it is equivalent to the English *h*. Thus *haṁ*
is English "hung", while *amhā* would be "umm, hah". When
following a hard consonant or the letter *ḷ*, *h* is a sign
of aspiration, not a separate letter. It is realized as a puff of air
following the letter.

Most unvoiced consonants in English are aspirated, whereas Pali has both
aspirated and unaspirated variants. We can emulate this by taking
advantage of the fact that in English we drop the aspiration when
following *s*. Thus *t* is pronounced like *t* in "still", while *th* is
like *t* in "till". Likewise for *p* in "spill" versus *ph* in "pill",
and *k* in "skill" versus *kh* in "kill". *C* is like *ch* in "beach",
while *ch* is like *chh* in "beachhouse". Note that Pali does not have
the fricative sounds spelled in English with *f* or *ph*, as well as
*th* as in "thing" or "there". *Th* is an aspirated *t*, and *ph* is an
aspirated *p*.

Voiced aspirated consonants (*gh*, *jh*, *ḍh*, *dh*, *bh*)
are not found in English, but they can be approximated by combining
words such as "bigheart" or "madhouse".

Doubled consonants are always pronounced, such "big gun", or "sad dad".
Before a double consonant, a long vowel is shortened.

Retroflex consonants are not found in English, but the effect is similar
to the American *r*. Thus Pali *pāṭi* is similar to the
American pronunciation of "party".

Finally, *v* is soft like *w*, *r* is like *r* in American English, and
*s* is pure sibilant (*sū* is "sue" not "zoo"). *Ṁ*, known
as *anusvāra*, nasalizes the preceding vowel, but in
practice it is usually pronounced as the *ng* in "sing".

### On the Pali Commentaries

The Pali canonical texts are accompanied by an extensive and detailed
set of commentaries (*aṭṭhakathā*) and subcommentaries
(*ṭīkā*). These texts are, for most people, even more
mysterious than the canon itself, so let me say a few words on them.

The main commentaries were compiled by the monk Buddhaghosa at the
Mahāvihāra monastery in Anuradhapura, then the capital of
Sri Lanka, in the 5th century. Buddhaghosa inherited a series of older
commentaries in the old Sinhalese language, now lost. These had been
compiled over the centuries in Sri Lanka, mostly between around 200
BCE--200 CE; that is to say, the main content of the commentaries was
closed several centuries before Buddhaghosa.

It was all a bit messy, with text in Pali and commentaries in Sinhala,
and a variety of different commentarial texts. Buddhaghosa aimed to
streamline the situation by combining all the old commentaries into a
single system, translated into Pali.

Buddhaghosa's work remains as an extraordinary accomplishment of
traditional scholarship. He had an almost preternatural mastery of his
materials, and the clarity and rigor of his writings make light work of
what must have been an exceedingly difficult task. It is crucial to
remember that he saw his work as that of an editor, compiler, and
translator. That is what he claimed to be doing, and from everything we
know about his work, he was a scholar of integrity who did exactly what
he said. When he felt a need to express his own opinion he said so; but
such interventions were rare and hesitant. The commentaries are the
record of discussions and explanations of the Pali texts handed down in
the Mahāvihāra tradition, not the opinions of Buddhaghosa.

While Buddhaghosa compiled commentaries on the major texts, he left some
incomplete. It is not always certain which commentaries were by him; but
in any case later scholars completed his work. Subsequently,
subcommentaries were written to clarify obscure points in the
commentaries.

In modern Theravāda, the commentaries have become a sadly
and unnecessarily divisive issue. Some people take the entire tradition
uncritically and regard the commentaries as essentially infallible.
Others flip to an extreme of suspecting anything in the commentaries,
rewriting Theravādin history as a conspiracy of the
commentaries. But any serious scholar knows that the commentaries are
often helpful, even indispensable, on countless difficult and obscure
points. Without them, there is no way we would have been able to create
the accurate dictionaries and translations that we have today. Yet they
cannot be relied on blindly, for, like any resource, they are fallible,
and must be read with a careful and critical eye. On some doctrinal
issues, the position of the commentaries had shifted considerably from
the stance in the suttas, and not in illuminating ways.

I once read some advice from a Burmese Sayadaw---I am afraid this was
many years ago and I have forgotten who it was---on how to use the
commentaries. He said---and I paraphrase---something like this. First
read the sutta. Try to understand it. Read it and meditate on it again
and again. If there's anything you don't understand, see if it can be
explained elsewhere in the suttas. If, at the end of the day, you still
cannot understand it, check the commentary. If it answers the question,
good. But if, after equally careful study, the commentary is still
unclear, then check the subcommentary.

This has always seemed like sound advice to me, and I have tried to
follow it. The purpose of the commentary is to help explain the suttas.
Where the suttas are clear---and mostly they are---there is no need to
refer to the commentary. The only extra thing I would add is that, in
addition to the commentaries and subcommentaries, we now also have
Chinese and Sanskrit parallels to help us understand difficult passages.

In these guides, I almost completely leave aside the commentarial
explanations. In several places the explanations I have given differ
from those in the commentaries. I am aware of this, and have written on
most of these things elsewhere, but I do not want to burden the guides
by re-litigating every controversy. I don't contradict the commentaries
out of ignorance or stubbornness, but because after many years of study,
contemplation, discussion, and practice, I have come to see some things
differently.

### A Brief and Incomplete Textual History

The significance of the *nikāyas* was recognized by
European scholars early on. I will discuss specifics of the editions and
translations in the essays on the individual *nikāyas*, and
here offer some general remarks.

During the 19th century, European scholars became aware of the Pali
tradition, seeing in it a reliable source of information for the Buddha,
his times and his teachings. An English civil servant in Sri Lanka,
Thomas Rhys Davids, learned Pali from the monks, initially to help him
better understand Sri Lankan legal practices. Recognizing the
significance of these texts, he returned to England and established the
Pali Text Society (PTS), largely funded by Asian donors. They obtained
palm-leaf manuscripts, on the basis of which the PTS prepared print
editions of the main Pali texts.

The PTS editions introduced a number of ideas from European scholarship.
Most obviously, they used a set of conventions for presenting Indic
scripts with European letters. This system is lossless, so texts may be
automatically changed from one script to another. It enables easy
comparison between the editions of the Pali canon from different
countries, which traditionally had been written in diverse local
scripts. They also introduced titles at the start of texts, punctuation
and capitalization, page numbers, footnotes, variant readings, and
various other modern innovations.

One innovation that was not pursued consistently was the use of chapter
and section numbers. These were added to the PTS Pali editions of the
Dīgha Nikāya and the Vinaya, and are used in
subsequent translations. However most of the PTS editions lack such
sections, with the unfortunate consequence that academic referencing of
Pali texts is still based on the volume and page of the PTS edition, a
system that is neither practical nor precise.

The PTS editions were ground-breaking and have exerted an unparalleled
influence on modern Buddhism, both east and west. Asian scholars have
been well aware of them, with the consequence that it is probably hard
to find any printed edition from the 20th century that is completely
free of their influence. Nevertheless, the PTS texts are not
particularly reliable. They were put together over a considerable period
of time, with scant resources and few workers. The editors used whatever
manuscripts they had to hand, and, apart from a general preference for
Sri Lankan readings, it is hard to discern a consistent or clear
methodology in their choices of readings. The limitations of these
editions are well known among experts in the field, and in some cases
updated and improved editions have been published.

For my translation of the *nikāyas*, I preferred to use the
Mahāsaṅgīti edition. This is essentially a digital
representation of the Burmese textual tradition of the 6th Council,
itself based on the 19th century 5th Council text. It is based on the
digital edition prepared by the Vipassana Research Institute, with
extensive proofreading and corrections by the Dhamma Society of Bangkok.
The Mahāsaṅgīti is a consistent and carefully edited
digital text, and for that reason was chosen as the root Pali text for
SuttaCentral. But it should not be assumed that it is the most
authentic. On the contrary, it preserves the Burmese readings, which
tend to correct the text in conformity with the Pali grammars.
Nevertheless, in almost all such cases there is no difference in the
meaning, just minor differences in spelling.

Like most translators, when editions vary I did not adhere to one
edition, but simply selected what seems to be the best reading in each
case. I referred to the PTS editions fairly often. More rarely, I
consulted the romanized Buddha Jayanthi edition found on GRETIL; note,
however, that the digital edition is widely regarded as being inferior
to the original in Sinhalese script. Occasionally I also consulted the
Rama 5 edition in Thai script. I also consulted previous translations,
especially those of Bhikkhu Bodhi.

In problematic cases I cross-checked the Pali against the Sanskrit and
Chinese parallels; I did not make use of Tibetan sources. However in
every case the overriding intention was to accurately represent the Pali
text. Only in a very few exceptional cases did I rely on the Sanskrit or
Chinese parallels to correct the Pali.
