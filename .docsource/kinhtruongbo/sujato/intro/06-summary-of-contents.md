# Summary of Contents

The Chapter on the Entire Spectrum of Ethics (*Sīlakkhandhavagga*)

:   The Chapter Containing the Section on Ethics
    (Sīlakkhandhavagga) is a chapter of 13 discourses. Each
    of these contains a long passage on the Gradual Training in ethics,
    meditation, and wisdom. The chapter is named after the first of
    these sections. The two other known versions of the
    Dīrghāgama (in Chinese and Sanskrit) also contain a
    similar chapter. Despite the monastic nature of the central
    teaching, most of these discourses are presented in dialog with lay
    people, with a strong emphasis on the relation between the Buddha's
    teachings and other contemporary movements.

DN 1: The Prime Net (*Brahmajālasutta*)

:   While others may praise or criticize the Buddha, they tend to focus
    on trivial details. The Buddha presents an analysis of 62 kinds of
    wrong view, seeing through which one becomes detached from
    meaningless speculations.

DN 2: The Fruits of the Ascetic Life (*Sāmaññaphalasutta*)

:   The newly crowned King Ajātasattu is disturbed by the
    violent means by which he achieved the crown. He visits the Buddha
    to find peace of mind, and asks him about the benefits of spiritual
    practice. This is one of the greatest literary and spiritual texts
    of early Buddhism.

DN 3: With Ambaṭṭha (*Ambaṭṭhasutta*)

:   A young brahmin student attacks the Buddha's family, but is put in
    his place.

DN 4: With Soṇadaṇḍa (*Soṇadaṇḍasutta*)

:   A reputed brahmin visits the Buddha, despite the reservations of
    other brahmins. They discuss the true meaning of a brahmin, and the
    Buddha skillfully draws him around to his own point of view.

DN 5: With Kūṭadanta (*Kūṭadantasutta*)

:   A brahmin wishes to undertake a great sacrifice, and asks for the
    Buddha's advice. The Buddha tells a legend of the past, in which a
    king is persuaded to give up violent sacrifice, and instead to
    devote his resources to supporting the needy citizens of his realm.
    However, even such a beneficial and non-violent sacrifice pales in
    comparison to the spiritual sacrifice of giving up attachments.

DN 6: With Mahāli (*Mahālisutta*)

:   The Buddha explains to a diverse group of lay people how the results
    of meditation depend on the manner of development.

DN 7: With Jāliya (*Jāliyasutta*)

:   This discourse is mostly quoted by the Buddha in the previous.

DN 8: The Longer Discourse on the Lion's Roar (*Mahāsīhanādasutta*)

:   The Buddha is challenged by a naked ascetic on the topic of
    spiritual austerities. He points out that it is quite possible to
    perform all kinds of austere practices without having any inner
    purity of mind.

DN 9: With Poṭṭhapāda (*Poṭṭhapādasutta*)

:   The Buddha discusses with a wanderer the nature of perception and
    how it evolves through deeper states of meditation. None of these,
    however, should be identified with a self or soul.

DN 10: With Subha (*Subhasutta*)

:   Shortly after the Buddha's death, Venerable Ānanda is invited to
    explain the core teachings.

DN 11: With Kevaddha (*Kevaṭṭasutta*)

:   The Buddha refuses to perform miracles, explaining that this is not
    the right way to inspire faith. He goes on to tell the story of a
    monk whose misguided quest for answers led him as far as
    Brahmā.

DN 12: With Lohicca (*Lohiccasutta*)

:   A brahmin has fallen into the idea that there is no point in trying
    to offer spiritual help to others. The Buddha goes to see him, and
    persuades him of the genuine benefits of spiritual teaching.

DN 13: The Three Knowledges (*Tevijjasutta*)

:   A number of brahmins are discussing the true path to
    Brahmā. Contesting the claims to authority based on the
    Vedas, the Buddha insists that only personal experience can lead to
    the truth.
