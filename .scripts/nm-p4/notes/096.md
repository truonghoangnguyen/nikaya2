SUTTA 96

[^894]: MA: It had been an ancient practice among the brahmins to wander for alms even when they possessed great wealth.

[^895]: Although agriculture may seem a strange occupation for one described as a merchant, it should be understood that
the vessas not only ran the urban business enterprises, but also owned and supervised agrarian undertakings.

[^896]: Ariyañ kho ahañ brāhmaṇa lokuttarañ dhammañ purisassa sandhanañ paññāpemi.

[^897]: Attabhāvassa abhinibbatti: literally, "wherever the reconception of his individuality takes place."
