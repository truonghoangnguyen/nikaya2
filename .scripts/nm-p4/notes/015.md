SUTTA 15

[^212]: Vadantu, meaning literally "let them speak to me," has the implied sense: "Let them speak to me by way of instruction and exhortation" (MA).

[^213]: See MN 5.10-29.

[^214]: See MN 8.44 and n. 109.

[^215]: It is from this passage that the sutta acquires its name.

[^216]: MA: The ancients called this sutta the "BhikkhupƒÅtimokkha." A bhikkhu should review himself three times daily in the way described in the sutta. If he cannot do so three times, then he should do so twice, or, at the minimum, once.
