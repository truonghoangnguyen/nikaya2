SUTTA 17

[^223]: The pattern on which $\S \S 3-6$ are constructed may be stated simply as follows:
no progress and requisites are scarce $=$ depart;
no progress and requisites are plentiful = depart;
progress and requisites are scarce $=$ stay;
progress and requisites are plentiful = stay.

[^224]: The same pattern is applied in $\S \S 7-22$ to village, town, city, and country.

[^225]: PTS ed., in reading here anāpuccha , "without taking leave," seems to be mistaken. BBS and SBJ eds. read äpuccha, "after taking leave," which seems more fitting. As the person on whom the bhikkhu relied - presumably a lay supporter - provided the requisites in adequate measure, courtesy requires that the bhikkhu take leave of him before departing.
