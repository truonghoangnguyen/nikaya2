SUTTA 114

[^1069]: This first paragraph offers merely a "table of contents," to be elaborated in the body of the sutta.

[^1070]: Aññamaññam. MA: The two are mutually exclusive, and there is no way by which the one can be regarded as the other.

[^1071]: Although wrong view and right view are usually included under mental conduct, in this sutta they are shown separately in §10 as "the acquisition of view."

[^1072]: Whereas the covetousness and ill will described in §7 possess the strength of a full course of action (kammapatha), in this section on inclination of mind (cittuppāda) they are shown in their nascent stage as mere dispositions that have not yet erupted into obsessive volitions.

[^1073]: "Acquisition of individuality" (attabhāvapaṭilābha) here refers to mode of rebirth.

[^1074]: Apariniṭhitabhāva. The translation of this unusual expression follows the gloss by MA.

[^1075]: MA points out that the clause "Forms are either the one or the other" is not used here because the distinction does not lie in the object but in the approach to it. For one person lust and other defilements arise towards a particular form, but another person develops dispassion and detachment in regard to the same form.

[^1076]: MA says that those who study the text and commentary to this sutta without practising in accordance with it cannot be said to "understand the detailed meaning." Only those who practise accordingly can be so described.
