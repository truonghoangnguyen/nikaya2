SUTTA 21

[^245]: At SN 12:12/ii. 13 Moliya Phagguna puts a series of questions to the Buddha, which the Buddha rejects as wrongly formulated. Later it is reported that he reverted to lay life (SN 12:32/ii.50).

[^246]: According to MA, the Buddha said this because Phagguna still did not wish to comply with his advice but continued to resist him, and this induced the Buddha to speak praise of the compliant bhikkhus during an earlier part of his ministry. For the passage on eating at a single session, see MN 65.2 and MN 70.2.

[^247]: Tadärammaṇam, lit. "with him as the object." MA: First one develops loving-kindness towards the person who addresses one with one or another of the five courses of
speech, then one directs that mind of loving-kindness towards all beings, making the entire world the object.
