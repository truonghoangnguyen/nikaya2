# 6. My Return to the Still

As I sat there in the silence of my mind, satisfied that Steve would
get me help, I felt relieved that I had successfully orchestrated my
rescue. My paralyzed arm was partially recovered and although it hurt, I
felt hopeful that it would recover completely. Yet even in this
discombobulated state, I felt a nagging obligation to contact my doctor.
It was obvious that I would need emergency treatment that would
probably be very expensive, and what a sad commentary that even in this
disjointed mentality, I knew enough to be worried that my HMO might
health center for
not cover my costs in the event that I went to the _wrong_ care.

Still sitting at my desk, with my good left arm I reached for the
three-inch stack of business cards I had collected over the past few years.
I had only visited my current doctor once, about 6 months earlier, but I
remembered that there was something Irish about her name -St.
something, St. something, so I began searching for associations. In my
mind's eye, I could recall perfectly the symbol of the Harvard crest
located in the top central position of her business card. Pleased with my
ability to remember exactly what the card looked like, I thought to
myself, _Fine, this will be just fine; all I have to do is find the card and make the call._

To my astonishment, however, as I looked at the top card, I
realized that although I retained a clear image in my mind of what I was
looking for, I could not discriminate any of the information on the card
in front of me. My brain could no longer distinguish writing as writing,
or symbols as symbols, or even background as background. Instead, the
card looked like an abstract tapestry of pixels. The entire picture was a
uniform blend of all its constituent pieces. The dots that formed the
symbols of language blended in smoothly with the dots of the
background. The distinctions of color and edge no longer registered to
my brain.

Dismayed, I realized that my ability to interact with the external
world had deteriorated far more than I could ever have imagined. My
grip on normal reality had been all but peeled away. I was no longer
capable of perceiving the mental cues I had depended on to visually
discriminate between objects. On top of my inability to identify my own
physical boundaries, and in the absence of my internal clock, I perceived
myself as fluid. Coupled with my loss of long-term and short-term
memories, I no longer felt grounded or safe in the external world.

What a daunting task it was to simply sit there in the center of my
silent mind, holding that stack of cards and trying to remember, _Who am I? What am I doing?_ Searching for any connection with my external
reality, I had lost all sense of urgency. Yet amazingly, my frontal lobe
fought hard to hang on to the task and I still embraced the occasional
wave of clarity that routed me back into this earthly realm via my
physical pain. During these moments of clarity, I could see, I could
identify, I could remember what I was doing, and I could discriminate
again between the varied incoming stimuli. So faithfully I plodded
forward. _That's not the card, that's not the card, that's not the card._ It
took over 35 minutes for me to navigate my way a mere inch down into
that stack where I finally recognized the Harvard crest.

By this point, however, the entire concept of a telephone was a
very interesting and bizarre kind of thing. I felt oddly removed from my
ability to have any comprehension about what it was I was supposed to
do with it. Somehow I understood that this "thing" in my space was
going to connect me through a wire to a completely different space. And
at the other end of the wire, there would be a person to whom I could
speak and she would understand me. Wow, imagine that!

Because I was afraid that I would lose my focus and the doctor's
card would get confused with the others, I cleared the desk space in front
of me and placed her card directly in front. I picked up the phone and
placed the number keypad on the desk right next to the business card.
Because my brain had been on a steady rate of disintegration, the
appearance of the number pad now looked completely strange and
foreign. As I sat there drifting in and out of my insubordinate left mind, I
remained calm. Periodically, I was able to match the number squiggle on
the card to the number squiggle on the telephone keypad. To keep track
of the numbers that I had already dialed, I covered the number on the
business card with my left index finger as soon as I pushed the number
on the phone using my stumpy right index finger. I had to do this
because I could not remember from moment to moment which numbers

I had already pressed. I repeated this strategy until all the numbers were
dialed and then I placed the phone to my ear and listened.

Feeling drained and disoriented, I was afraid that I would forget
what I was doing, so I continued to repeat in my mind, _This is Jill Taylor. I'm having a stroke. This is Jill Taylor. I'm having a stroke._ But
when the phone was answered and I tried to speak, I was blown away to
discover that although I could hear myself speaking clearly, within my
mind, no sound came out of my throat. Not even the grunts that I was
able to produce earlier. I was flabbergasted. _Oh my gosh! I can't talk, I can't talk!_ And it wasn't until this moment when I tried to speak out loud
that I had any idea that I couldn't. My vocal cords were inoperative and
nothing, no sound at all, would come forth.

Like priming a pump, I pushed air forcefully out of my chest and
inhaled deeply, over and over again, trying to make some sound, trying
to make any sound come out. Realizing what I was doing, I thought,
_They're going to think this is an obscene phone call! Don't hang up! Please don't hang up!_ But just like priming a pump, repeatedly pushing
the air in and out, forcing my chest and my throat to vibrate, "Uhhhhhh,
uhhhhhh,  thhhhhh,  thhhhhhe, thhhhhiiiiiiizzzxzzaaaaaaa" finally came out. The call was immediately
forwarded from the receptionist to my doctor, who miraculously just
happened to be sitting in for office hours! With the patience of a gentle
soul, she sat and she listened as I struggled to enunciate, "This is Jill
Taylor. I'm having a stroke."

Eventually my doctor understood enough of my message to
comprehend who I was and what I needed. She directed me, "Get to
Mount Auburn Hospital." As she spoke, although I could hear her
words, I could not grasp their meaning. Feeling despondent, I thought to
myself, _If only she would speak more slowly and enunciate more clearly, perhaps I could get it, perhaps I could understand._ With hope in my
heart, I pleaded in a semi-intelligible way, "Again?" With concern, she
slowly repeated her directive, "Get to Mount Auburn Hospital." Yet
again, I could not comprehend. With patience and genuine compassion
for my obvious neurological breakdown, she repeated her directive.
Repeatedly, I could not connect meaning to the sounds and make sense
of what she said. Feeling exasperated by my own inability to understand
her simple language, I primed my vocal pump again and somehow
communicated that help was on its way and we would call her back.

At this point, it didn't take a brain scientist to understand what was
going on in my brain. The longer the blood from the hemorrhage
continued to spill into my cortex, the more massive the tissue damage
would become and the more cognitively inept I would be. Although the
AVM originally burst near the middle to posterior portion of my cerebral
cortex in my left hemisphere, by this point, the cells in my left frontal
lobe - responsible for my ability to generate language, were also
compromised. It was predictable that as the blood interrupted the flow of
information transmission between my two language centers (Broca's
anteriorly and Wernicke's posteriorly, p. 40), I could neither
create/express language nor understand it. At this point in time,
however, my greatest concern was that my vocal cords were not
responding to my mental cues. I still feared that the centers in the pons
of my brainstem, including my center for inspiration, were possibly at
risk.

Feeling defeated and tired, I hung up the phone. Rising from my
seat, I wrapped a scarf around my head to block the streaming light from
my eyes. Picturing the deadbolt on my front door, I slowly navigated my
body, step by step, down the front flight of stairs by sliding on my butt.

Ready for company and no longer preoccupied with what I felt
compelled to do, I crawled back up the stairs to my living room, where I
crouched on my couch to quiet my weary mind.

Despondent and alone, I felt discomfort in my pulsating head, and
I communed with my wound as I acknowledged the degeneration of my
connection to this life. With every moment that passed, I felt my
connection with my body becoming weaker. I sensed that my energy was
leaking out of this fragile container - deadening the distal tips of my
fingers and toes. I could hear the machinery of my body grinding its
wheels as my cells systematically manufactured my life, and I feared
that my cognitive mind was becoming so disabled, so detached from its
normal ability to function, that I would be rendered permanently
disabled. For the first time in my life, I understood that I was not
invincible. Unlike a computer that could be turned off and then rebooted,
the richness of my life was completely dependent on not only the health
of my cellular structure, but on the integrity of my brain's ability to
electrically transmit and communicate its directives.

Humbled by the direness of my situation, I grieved for the loss of
my life as I anticipated the death and degeneration of my cellular matrix.
Despite the overwhelming presence of the engulfing bliss of my right
mind, I fought desperately to hold on to whatever conscious connections
I still retained in my left mind. By now, I understood clearly that I was
no longer a normal human being. My consciousness no longer retained
the discriminatory functions of my dominant analytical left brain.
Without those inhibiting thoughts, I had stepped beyond my perception
of myself as an individual. Without my left brain available to help me
identify myself as a complex organism made up of multiple
interdependent systems or to define me as a distinct collection of
fragmented functions, my consciousness ventured unfettered into the
peaceful bliss of my divine right mind.

As I sat in the silence and pondered my new perceptions, I
wondered how disabled I could become before the loss would be
permanent. I contemplated how many circuits I could lose and how
detached from my higher cognitive abilities I could tread and still have
any hope of ever regaining normal function. I hadn't come this far to just
die or become mentally vegetative! So I held my head in my hands and
wept. Amidst my tears, I clenched my fists and prayed. I prayed for
peace in my heart. I prayed for peace in my mind and I prayed, _Please Great Spirit, don't shut down my life._ And into the silence my mind
implored, _Hold on. Be still. Be quiet. Hold on._

I sat there in the middle of my living room for what seemed to be
an eternity. When Steve appeared in the doorway, no words were
exchanged. I handed him my doctor's card and he immediately called for
instructions.

Promptly, he escorted me down the stairs and out the door. Gently, he
guided me to his car, strapped me in, and reclined the seat. He wrapped
my head with a scarf to shade my eyes from the light. He spoke softly,
encouragingly patted my knee, and proceeded to drive to Mount Auburn
Hospital.

By the time we arrived, I was still conscious but obviously
delirious. They placed me in a wheelchair and led us into the waiting
room. Steve was clearly distressed with their indifference to the severity
of my condition, but he obediently filled out my paperwork and helped
me sign my name. Waiting for our turn, I felt the energy in my body
shift and like a balloon I deflated into my own lap, shifting into a semiconscious condition. Steve insisted that I receive immediate attention!

I was taken to have a CT scan of my brain. They lifted me out of
the wheelchair and placed me on the CT gurney. Despite the throbbing
pain in my brain that was echoed by the thumping sounds of the
machine's motor, I was conscious enough to find some satisfaction in
learning that my selfdiagnosis had been correct. I was experiencing a
rare form of stroke. I had a massive hemorrhage flooding the left
hemisphere of my brain. Although I don't recall it, my medical records
indicate that I was given an initial dose of steroids to slow the
inflammation.

The agenda was to ship me immediately to Massachusetts General
Hospital. My gurney was lifted and bolted into position in an ambulance
for the ride across Boston. I remember that a kind-hearted paramedic
accompanied me along my journey. With compassion, he wrapped me in
a blanket and arranged a jacket over my face to protect my eyes. His
touch upon my back was comforting; his gentle kindness, priceless.

I was finally free from worry. I curled up into a fetal ball and lay
waiting. I understood that, on this morning, I had witnessed the step-bystep deterioration of my intricate neurological circuitry. I had always
celebrated my life as a magnificent physical manifestation of my DNA,
and oh, what a colorful genetic pool from which I had been spawned!
For 37 years, I had been blessed with an agile mosaic of electrified
biochemistry. And, like many folks, I had fantasized that I wanted to be
awake when I died because I wanted to witness that remarkable final
transition.

Just before noon, on December 10, 1996, the electrical vitality of
my molecular mass grew dim, and when I felt my energy lift, my
cognitive mind surrendered its connection to, and command over, my
body's physical mechanics. Sanctioned deep within a sacred cocoon with
a silent mind and a tranquil heart, I felt the enormousness of my energy
lift. My body fell limp, and my consciousness rose to a slower vibration.
I clearly understood that I was no longer the choreographer of this life.
In the absence of sight, sound, touch, smell, taste, and fear, I felt my
spirit surrender its attachment to this body and I was released from the
pain.
