# 15. My Stroke Of Insight
Having taken this unexpected journey into the depths of my brain,
I am grateful and amazed that I have completely recovered physically,
cognitively, emotionally, and spiritually. Over the years, the recovery of
my left hemisphere skills has been tremendously challenging for many
different reasons. When I lost the function of my left brain's
neurological networks, I lost not only function but also a variety of
personality characteristics that were apparently associated with those
circuits of aptitude. Recovering cells of function that were anatomically
linked to a lifetime of emotional reactivity and negative thinking has
been a mind-opening experience. Although I wanted to regain my left
hemisphere skills, I must say that there were personality traits that tried
to rise from the ashes of my left mind that, quite frankly, were no longer
acceptable to my right hemispheric sense of who I now wanted to be.
From both a neuroanatomical and psychological perspective, I have had
a fascinating few years.

The question I faced over and over again was, _Do I have to regain the affect, emotion or personality trait that was neurologically linked to the memory or ability that I wanted to recover?_ For instance, would it
be possible for me to recover my perception of my _self_, where I exist as
a single, solid, separate from the whole, without recovering the cells
associated with my egotism, intense desire to be argumentative, need to
be right, or fear of separation and death? Could I value money without
hooking into the neurological loops of lack, greed, or selfishness?

Could I regain my personal power in the world, play the game of
hierarchy, and yet not lose my sense of compassion or perception of
equality among all people? Could I reengage with my family and not
hook into my issues related to being a little sister? Most important,
could I retain my newfound sense of connection with the universe in the
presence of my left hemisphere's individuality?

I wondered how much of my newly found right hemisphere
consciousness, set of values, and resultant personality I would have to
sacrifice in order to recover the skills of my left mind. I didn't want to
lose my connection to the universe. I didn't want to experience myself as
a solid separate from everything. I didn't want my mind to spin so fast
that I was no longer in touch with my authentic _self._ Frankly, I didn't
want to give up Nirvana. What price would my right hemisphere
consciousness have to pay so I could once again be judged as _normal_ ?

Modern neuroscientists seem satisfied intellectualizing about the
functional asymmetries of our two hemispheres from a neurological
perspective, but there has been minimal conversation pertaining to the
psychological or personality differences contained within these two
structures. Most commonly, the character of our right mind has been
ridiculed and portrayed in an extremely unflattering light, simply
because it does not understand verbal language or comprehend linear
thought. In the case of the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde analogy, our right
hemisphere personality is depicted as an uncontrollable, potentially
violent, moronic, rather despicable ignoramus, which is not even
conscious, and without whom we would probably be better off! In vast
contrast, our left mind has routinely been touted as linguistic, sequential,
methodical, rational, smart, and the seat of our consciousness.

Prior to this experience with stroke, the cells in my left hemisphere
had been capable of dominating the cells in my right hemisphere. The
judging and analytical character in my left mind dominated my
personality. When I experienced the hemorrhage and lost my left
hemisphere language center cells that defined my _self_, those cells could
no longer inhibit the cells in my right mind. As a result, I have gained a
clear delineation of the two very distinct characters cohabiting my
cranium. The two halves of my brain don't just perceive and think in
different ways at a neurological level, but they demonstrate very
different values based upon the types of information they perceive, and
thus exhibit very different personalities. My stroke of insight is that at
the core of my right hemisphere consciousness is a character that is
directly connected to my feeling of deep inner peace. It is completely
committed to the expression of peace, love, joy, and compassion in the
world.

This is not to say, of course, that I believe I exhibit multiple
personality disorder. That is much more complicated than what I have
observed. Traditionally, it has been difficult, if not impossible, for us to
distinguish between our right and left mind characters simply because
we experience ourselves as a single person with a single consciousness.
However, with very little guidance, most people find it easy to identify
these same two characters within if not themselves, then at least their
parents or significant other. It is my goal to help you find a hemispheric
home for each of your characters so that we can honor their identities
and perhaps have more say in how we want to be in the world. By
recognizing who is who inside our cranium, we can take a more
_balanced-brain_ approach to how we lead our lives.

It appears that many of us struggle regularly with polar opposite
characters holding court inside our heads. In fact, just about everyone I
speak with is keenly aware that they have conflicting parts of their
personality. Many of us speak about how our head (left hemisphere) is
telling us to do one thing while our heart (right hemisphere) is telling us
to do the exact opposite. Some of us distinguish between what we think
(left hemisphere) and what we feel (right hemisphere). Others
communicate about our mind consciousness (left hemisphere) versus our
body's instinctive consciousness (right hemisphere). Some of us talk
about our small ego mind (left hemisphere) compared with our capital
ego mind (right hemisphere), or our small self (left hemisphere) versus
our inner or authentic self (right hemisphere). Some of us delineate
between our work mind (left hemisphere) and our vacation mind (right
hemisphere), while others refer to their researcher mind (left
hemisphere) versus their diplomatic mind (right hemisphere). And of
course there is our masculine mind (left hemisphere) versus our feminine
mind (right hemisphere), and our yang consciousness (left hemisphere)
countered by our yin consciousness (right hemisphere). And if you are a
Carl Jung fan, then there's our sensing mind (left hemisphere) versus our
intuitive mind (right hemisphere), and our judging mind (left
hemisphere) versus our perceiving mind (right hemisphere). Whatever
language you use to describe your two parts, based upon my experience,
I believe they stem anatomically from the two very distinct hemispheres
inside your head.

My goal during this process of recovery has been not only to find
a healthy balance between the functional abilities of my two
hemispheres, but also to have more say about which character dominates
my perspective at any given moment. I find this to be important because
the most fundamental traits of my right hemisphere personality are deep
inner peace and loving compassion. I believe the more time we spend
running our inner peace/compassion circuitry, then the more
peace/compassion we will project into the world, and ultimately the
more peace/compassion we will have on the planet. As a result, the
clearer we are about which side of our brain is processing what types of
information, the more choice we have in how we think, feel, and behave
not just as individuals, but as collaborating members of the human
family.

From a neuroanatomical perspective, I gained access to the
experience of deep inner peace in the consciousness of my right mind
when the language and orientation association areas in the left
hemisphere of my brain became nonfunctional. The brain research
performed by Drs. Andrew Newberg and the late Eugene D'Aquil [1]
earlier this decade have helped me understand exactly what was going
on in my brain. Using SPECT technology (single photon emission
computed tomography), these scientists identified the neuroanatomy
underlying our ability to have a religious or spiritual (mystical)
experience.  They wanted to understand which regions of the brain were
involved in our capacity to undergo a shift in consciousness - away from
being an individual to feeling that we are at _one_ with the universe (God,
Nirvana, euphoria).

Tibetan meditators and Franciscan nuns were invited to meditate
or pray inside the SPECT machine. They were instructed to tug on a
cotton twine when they reached either their meditative climax or felt
united with God. These experiments identified shifts in neurological
activity in very specific regions in the brain. First, there was a decrease
in the activity of the left hemisphere language centers resulting in a
silencing of their brain chatter. Second, there was a decrease in activity
in the orientation association area, located in the posterior parietal gyrus
of the left hemisphere. This region of our left brain helps us identify our
personal physical boundaries. When this area is inhibited or displays
decreased

input from our sensory systems, we lose sight of where we begin and
where we end relative to the space around us.

Thanks to this recent research, it makes good neurological sense
that when my left language centers were silenced and my left orientation
association area was interrupted from its normal sensory input, my
consciousness shifted away from feeling like a solid, to a perception of
myself as a fluid - at _one_ with the universe.
