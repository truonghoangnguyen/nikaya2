# 17. Own Your Power

I define responsibility (response-ability) as the ability to choose
how we respond to stimulation coming in through our sensory
systems at any moment in time. Although there are certain limbic
system (emotional) programs that can be triggered automatically, it
takes less than 90 seconds for one of these programs to be triggered,
surge through our body, and then be completely flushed out of our
blood stream. My anger response, for example, is a programmed
response that can be set off automatically. Once triggered, the
chemical released by my brain surges through my body and I have a
physiological experience. Within 90 seconds from the initial trigger,
the chemical component of my anger has completely dissipated from
my blood and my automatic response is over. If, however, I remain
angry after those 90 seconds have passed, then it is because I have
_chosen_ to let that circuit continue to run. Moment by moment, I make
the choice to either hook into my neurocircuitry or move back into the
present moment, allowing that reaction to melt away as fleeting
physiology.

The really exciting news about acknowledging my right and left
characters is that I always have an alternative way of looking at any
situation - is my glass half full or half empty? If you approach me
with anger and frustration, then I make the choice to either reflect
your anger and engage in argument (left brain), or be empathic and
approach you with a compassionate heart (right brain). What most of
us don't realize is that we are unconsciously making choices about
how we respond all the time. It is so easy to get caught up in the
wiring of our pre-programmed reactivity (limbic system) that we live
our lives cruising along on automatic pilot. I have learned that the
more attention my higher cortical cells pay to what's going on inside
my limbic system, the more say I have about what I am thinking and
feeling. By paying attention to the choices my automatic circuitry is
making, I own my power and make more choices consciously. In the
long run, I take responsibility for what I attract into my life.

Nowadays, I spend a whole lot of time thinking about thinking just
because I find my brain so fascinating. As Socrates said, "The
unexamined life is not worth living." There has been nothing more
empowering than the realization that I don't have to think thoughts that
bring me pain. Of course there is nothing wrong with thinking about
things that bring me pain as long as I am aware that I am choosing to
engage in that emotional circuitry. At the same time, it is freeing to know
that I have the conscious power to stop thinking those thoughts when I
am satiated. It is liberating to know that I have the ability to choose a
peaceful and loving mind (my right mind), whatever my physical or
mental circumstances, by deciding to _step to the right_ and bring my
thoughts back to the present moment.

More often than not, I choose to observe my environment through
the nonjudgmental eyes of my right mind, allowing me to retain my
inner joy and remain detached from emotionally charged circuitry. I
alone decide if something will have a positive or negative influence on
my psyche. Recently, I was driving down the road singing at the top of
my lungs with my favorite Ginger Curr[1] CD, "I got JOOOOOY in my heart!" To my chagrin, I was pulled over for speeding
(apparently there was way too much enthusiasm going on behind the
wheel!). Since receiving that ticket, I have had to make the decision at
least 100 times to not feel down about it. This little voice of negativity
kept trying to raise its ugly head and bum me out. It wanted to mull the
drama over and over again in my mind, from every angle, but regardless
of my contemplation, the situation would have the same outcome.
Frankly, I find this sort of mental obsessing by my left hemisphere story
teller to be a waste of time and emotionally draining. Thanks to my
stroke, I have learned that I can own my power and stop thinking about
events that have occurred in the past by consciously realigning myself
with the present.

With that said, however, there are some occasions when I will
choose to step into the world as a single, solid, ego center separate from
you. Sometimes it is just pure satisfaction for me to bump my left
hemisphere stuff and attitudes up against your left hemisphere stuff and
attitudes, in argument or passionate debate. More often than not, I don't
like how aggression feels inside my body so I shy away from hostile
confrontation and choose compassion.

For me, it's really easy to be kind to others when I remember that
none of us came into this world with a manual about how to get it all
right. We are ultimately a product of our biology and environment.
Consequently, I choose to be compassionate with others when I consider
how much painful emotional baggage we are biologically programmed
to carry around. I recognize that mistakes will be made, but this does not
mean that I need to either victimize myself or take your actions and
mistakes personally. Your stuff is your stuff, and my stuff is my stuff.
Feeling deep inner peace and sharing kindness is always a choice for
either of us. Forgiving others and forgiving myself is always a choice.
Seeing this moment as a perfect moment is always a choice.
