# 9. Day Two: The Morning After

I awoke early the next morning to a medical student who
came rushing in to take a medical history. I thought it curious that
she had not been informed that I was a stroke survivor who could
not speak or understand language. I realized that morning that a
hospital's number one responsibility should be protecting its
patients' energy levels. This young girl was an energy vampire.
She wanted to take something from me despite my fragile
condition, and she had nothing to give me in return. She was
rushing against a clock and obviously losing the race. In her haste,
she was rough in the way she handled me and I felt like a detail
that had fallen through someone's crack. She spoke a million
miles a minute and hollered at me as if I were deaf. I sat and
observed her absurdity and ignorance. She was in a hurry and I
was a stroke survivor - not a natural match! She might have gotten
something more from me had she come to me gently with
patience and kindness, but because she insisted that I come to her
in her time and at her pace, it was not satisfying for either of us.
Her demands were annoying and I felt weary from the encounter.
I realized that I would have to protect my precious energy with
keen caution.

The biggest lesson I learned that morning was that when it
came to my rehabilitation, I was ultimately the one in control of
the success or failure of those caring for me. It was my decision to
show up or not. I chose to show up for those professionals who
brought me energy by connecting with me, touching me gently
and appropriately, making direct eye contact with me, and
speaking to me calmly. I responded positively to positive
treatment. The professionals who did not connect with me sapped
my energy, so I protected myself by ignoring their requests.

Making the decision to recover was a difficult, complicated, and
cognitive choice for me. On the one hand, I loved the bliss of drifting in
the current of the eternal flow. Who wouldn't? It was beautiful there. My
spirit beamed free, enormous, and peaceful. In the rapture of an
engulfing bliss, I had to question what recovery really meant. Clearly,
there were some advantages to having a functional left hemisphere. It
would allow me the skills of interacting with the external world again. In
this state of disability, however, attending to what I perceived as chaos
was pure pain, and the effort it would take for me to recover, well, was
that my priority?

Honestly, there were certain aspects of my new existence that I
preferred over the way I had been before. I was not willing to
compromise my new insights in the name of recovery. I liked knowing I
was a fluid. I loved knowing my spirit was at _one_ with the universe and
in the flow with everything around me. I found it fascinating to be so
tuned in to energy dynamics and body language. But most of all, I loved
the feeling of deep inner peace that flooded the core of my very being.

I yearned to be in a place where people were calm and valued my
experience of inner peace. Because of my heightened empathy, I found
that I was overly sensitive to feeling other people's stress. If recovery
meant that I had to feel like they felt all the time, I wasn't interested. It
was easy for me to separate my "stuff" and emotions from other people's
"stuff" and emotions by choosing to observe but not engage. As
Marianne Williamson puts it, "Could I rejoin the rat race without
becoming a rat again?"

Andrew, another medical student, came by that same morning to
give me yet another neurological exam. I was wobbly, incredibly weak,
and not capable of sitting up by myself, much less capable of standing
up on my feet. But because he was gentle yet firm in his touch, I felt safe
with him. He spoke calmly, looked me directly in the eyes, and repeated
himself as needed. He was respectful of me as a person - even in this
condition. I was confident he would grow up to be a fine doctor. I hope
that he has.

Dr. Anne Young, who was, at that time, the chairperson of the
Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Neurology (I call her the
Queen of Neurology), was my neurologist. I had heard about the famous
Anne Young for years while working at the Harvard Brain Bank. She
served on the Advisory Committee for the Harvard Brain Bank and just
two weeks earlier, it was my privilege to sit next to her at an Advisory
Counsel luncheon held at the annual Neuroscience Meetings in New
Orleans. At the luncheon, I presented the outreach efforts I was engaged
in to increase the number of brains donated for research by the
psychiatrically-diagnosed population. Dr. Young had met the
"professional me" that day, so by the time she found me on her morning
roster, we had already established a special rapport.

Among the many circuits in my brain that had gone off-line, it was
my good fortune that my circuitry for embarrassment had also gone
awry. Very much like a mother duck followed by her long row of
ducklings, Dr. Young and her entourage of medical students arrived at
my doorway for morning rounds. To my retrospective horror, I was
buck-naked with my derriere in the air and in the middle of a sponge
bath, when the Queen of Neurology and her party arrived!

Dr. Young's eyes were soft and kind, and she smiled as she looked
me straight in the eye. When she approached, she immediately reached
for my foot - much like a good horse handler will touch a horse on their
backside as they pass behind it. Dr. Young helped me into a comfortable
position. She then stood by my shoulder, gently resting her hands on my
arm, and spoke softly to me - not to her students, but to me. She leaned
over the edge of my bed and got close enough to my face that I could
hear her. Although I could not completely understand her words, I
completely understood her intention. This woman understood that I was
not stupid but that I was wounded, and it was clear that she knew that it
was her job to figure out which circuits of mine were still active and
which parts needed healing.

Dr. Young respectfully asked me if it was okay that she teach her
students about the neurological exam, and I agreed. As it turned out, I
was the brain scientist who failed every task on cue and Dr. Young did
not leave my bedside until she was confident that I had no more need of
her. On her way out the door, she squeezed my hand and then my toe. I
felt a huge sense of relief that she was my physician. I felt that she
understood me.

Later that morning, it was time for me to have an angiogram that
would outline the blood vessels in my brain. We needed a really good
picture of exactly what type of hemorrhage I had had, and the angiogram
was the test of choice. Although I thought it absolutely absurd that
anyone would ask me to sign a form of consent while in this condition, I
realized that policy is policy! How do we define "of sound mind and
body" anyway?

Bad news certainly travels fast. Word of my stroke surged through
the networks of both McLean Hospital and the membership of NAMI.
Here I was, the youngest national board member they had ever elected,
having a stroke at 37.

Two of my colleagues from the Brain Bank came to visit while I
was in the Neurology ICU that afternoon. Mark and Pam brought a little
stuffed bear for me to cuddle, and I was grateful for their kindness.
Although I could sense their initial trepidation, they brought me positive
energy and told me, "You're Jill, you're going to be just fine." This
confidence in my complete recovery was priceless to me.

By the end of day two, I had accumulated enough oomph inside
my body to roll myself over, sit up on the edge of the bed with assistance
and then stand upright while leaning on someone for support. Although I
found this activity to take every ounce of energy I had, I was making
terrific physical progress. My right arm was very weak and continued to
ache, but I could wield it around using my shoulder muscles.

On and off throughout the day, the energy in my body waxed and
waned from a little bit of energy to a completely empty tank. With sleep,
my reservoir filled a little and then I spent that energy trying to _do_ or
_think_ something. Once my reserve was used up, I had to go back to
sleep. I learned immediately that I had no staying power and once my
energy was shot, I fell limp. I realized I had to pay very close attention
to my energy gauge. I would have to learn how to conserve it and be
willing to sleep to restore it.

Day two ended with a visit from Steve bearing news that G.G.
would be arriving in Boston early the next morning. Initially, I didn't
understand the significance of G.G. - as I had lost the concept of what a
mother was. I spent the rest of my waking moments that evening trying
to piece together _Mother, Mother, Mother. G.G., G.G., G.G._ I kept
repeating the words to find those files, open them and remember.
Eventually, I kind of understood what a mother was and what G.G.
represented...enough so that I felt excited that she would be here
tomorrow.
