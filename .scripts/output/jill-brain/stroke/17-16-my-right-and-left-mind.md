# 16. My Right And Left Mind

I understand that no matter what information is being processed
(or not being processed) in my two hemispheres, I still experience the
collective of myself as a single entity with a single mind. I do believe
that the consciousness we exhibit is the collective consciousness of
whatever cells are functioning, and that both of our hemispheres
complement one another as they create a single seamless perception of
the world. If the cells and circuitry that recognize faces are functioning
correctly, then I am capable of recognizing you by your face. If not,
then I use other information to identify you, like your voice,
mannerisms, or the gait of your walk. If the cellular circuitry that
understands language is intact, then I can understand you when you
speak. If the cells and circuitry that continually remind me of who I am
and where I live are destroyed, then my concept of myself will be
permanently altered. That is, unless other cells in my brain learn to take
over those particular functions. Much like a computer, if I don't have a
program for word processing, then I can't perform that function.

When we evaluate the unique characteristics of the two cerebral
hemispheres and how they process information differently, it seems
obvious that they would manifest unique value systems that would
consequently result in very different personalities. Some of us have
nurtured both of our characters and are really good at utilizing the skills
and personalities of both sides of our brain, allowing them to support,
influence, and temper one another as we live our lives. Others of us,
however, are quite unilateral in our thinking - either exhibiting
extremely rigid thinking patterns that are analytically critical (extreme
left brain), or we seldom connect to a common reality and spend most
of our time "with our head in the clouds" (extreme right brain).
Creating a healthy balance between our two characters enables us the
ability to remain cognitively flexible enough to welcome change (right
hemisphere), and yet remain concrete enough to stay a path (left
hemisphere). Learning to value and utilize all of our cognitive gifts
opens our lives up to the masterpiece of life we truly are. Imagine the
compassionate world we could create if we set our minds to it.

Sadly, the expression of compassion is often a rarity in our society.
Many of us spend an inordinate amount of time and energy degrading,
insulting, and criticizing ourselves (and others) for having made a
"wrong" or "bad" decision. When you berate yourself, have you ever
questioned: who inside of you is doing the yelling, and at whom are you
yelling? Have you ever noticed how these negative internal thought
patterns have the tendency to generate increased levels of inner hostility
and/ or raised levels of anxiety? And to complicate matters even more,
have you noticed how negative internal dialogue can negatively
influence how you treat others and, thus, what you attract?

As biological creatures, we are profoundly powerful people.
Because our neural networks are made up of neurons communicating
with other neurons in circuits, their behavior becomes quite predictable.
The more conscious attention we pay to any particular circuit, or the
more time we spend thinking specific thoughts, the more impetus those
circuits or thought patterns have to run again with minimal external
stimulation.

In addition, our minds are highly sophisticated "seek and ye shall
find" instruments. We are designed to focus in on whatever we are
looking for. If I seek red in the world then I will find it everywhere.
Perhaps just a little in the beginning, but the longer I stay focused on
looking for red, then before you know it, I will see red everywhere.

My two hemispheric personalities not only think about things
differently, but they process emotions and carry my body in easily
distinguishable ways. At this point, even my friends are capable of
recognizing who's walking into the room by how I'm holding my
shoulders and what's going on with that furrow in my brow. My right
hemisphere is all about _right here, right now._ It bounces around with
unbridled enthusiasm and does not have a care in the world. It smiles a
lot and is extremely friendly. In contrast, my left hemisphere is
preoccupied with details and runs my life on a tight schedule. It is my
more serious side. It clenches my jaw and makes decisions based upon
what it learned in the past. It defines boundaries and judges everything
as right/wrong or good/bad. And oh yes, it does that thing with my brow.

My right mind is all about the richness of this present moment. It
is filled with gratitude for my life and everyone and everything in it. It is
content, compassionate, nurturing, and eternally optimistic. To my right
mind character, there is no judgment of good/bad or right/wrong, so
everything exists on a continuum of relativity. It takes things as they are
and acknowledges what is in the present. The temperature is cooler
today than yesterday. It doesn't care. Today it will rain. It makes no
difference. It may observe that one person is taller than another person,
or this person has more money than that person, but these observations
are made without judgment. To my right mind, we are all equal members
of the human family. My right mind does not perceive or give heed to
territories or artificial boundaries like race or religion.

One of the greatest blessings I received as a result of this
hemorrhage is that I had the chance to rejuvenate and strengthen my
neurocircuits of innocence and inner joy. Thanks to this stroke, I have
become free to explore the world again with childlike curiosity. In the
absence of obvious and immediate danger, I feel safe in the world and
walk the earth as though it is my backyard. In the consciousness of my
right mind, we are laced together as the universal tapestry of human
potential, and life is good and we are all beautiful -just the way we are.

My right mind character is adventurous, celebrative of abundance,
and socially adept. It is sensitive to nonverbal communication, empathic,
and accurately decodes emotion. My right mind is open to the eternal
flow whereby I exist at _one_ with the universe. It is the seat of my divine
mind, the knower, the wise woman, and the observer. It is my intuition
and higher consciousness. My right mind is ever present and gets lost in
time.

One of the natural functions of my right mind is to bring me new
insight in this moment so I can update old files that contain outdated
information. For example, throughout my childhood I would not eat
squash. Thanks to my right hemisphere, I was willing to give squash a
second chance and now I love it. Many of us make judgments with our
left hemisphere and then are not willing to _step to the right_ (that is, into
the consciousness of our right hemisphere) for a file update. For many of
us, once we have made a decision, then we are attached to that decision
forever. I have found that often the last thing a really dominating left
hemisphere wants is to share its limited cranial space with an openminded right counterpart!

My right mind is open to new possibilities and thinks out of the
box. It is not limited by the rules and regulations established by my left
mind that created that box. Consequently, my right mind is highly
creative in its willingness to try something new. It appreciates that chaos
is the first step in the creative process. It is kinesthetic, agile, and loves
my body's ability to move fluidly into the world. It is tuned in to the
subtle messages my cells communicate via gut feelings, and it learns
through touch and experience.

My right mind celebrates its freedom in the universe and is not
bogged down by my past or fearful of what the future may or may not
bring. It honors my life and the health of all my cells. And it doesn't just
care about my body; it cares about the fitness of your body, our mental
health as a society, and our relationship with Mother Earth.

The consciousness of our right mind appreciates that every cell in
our bodies (except for the red blood cells) contains the exact same
molecular genius as the original zygote cell that was created when our
mother's egg cell combined with our father's sperm cell. My right mind
understands that I am the life force power of the fifty trillion molecular
geniuses crafting my form! (And it bursts into song about that on a
regular basis!) It understands that we are all connected to one another in
an intricate fabric of the cosmos, and it enthusiastically marches to the
beat of its own drum.

Freed from all perception of boundaries, my right mind proclaims,
"I am a part of it all. We are brothers and sisters on this planet. We are
here to help make this world a more peaceful and kinder place." My
right mind sees unity among all living entities, and I am hopeful that you
are intimately aware of this character within yourself.

As much as I obviously adore the attitude, openness, and
enthusiasm with which my right mind embraces life, my left mind is
equally amazing. Please remember that this is the character I just spent
the better part of a decade resurrecting. My left mind is responsible for
taking all of that energy, all of that information about the present
moment, and all of those magnificent possibilities perceived by my right
mind, and shaping them into something manageable.

My left mind is the tool I use to communicate with the external
world. Just as my right mind thinks in collages of images, my left mind
thinks in language and speaks to me constantly. Through the use of brain
chatter, it not only keeps me abreast of my life, but also manifests my
identity. Via my left brain language center's ability to say, "I am," I
become an independent entity separate from the eternal flow. As such, I
become a single, a solid, separate from the whole.

Our left brain truly is one of the finest tools in the universe when it
comes to organizing information. My left hemisphere personality takes
pride in its ability to categorize, organize, describe, judge, and critically
analyze absolutely everything. It thrives in its constant contemplation
and calculation. Regardless of whether or not my mouth is running, my
left mind stays busy theorizing, rationalizing, and memorizing. It is a
perfectionist and an amazing housekeeper of corporation or home. It
constantly says, "Everything has a place and everything belongs in its
place." Our right mind character values humanity, while our left mind
character concerns itself with finances and economy.

On the scale of _doing,_ my left mind is a magnificent multi-tasker
and loves performing as many functions as it can at the same time. It is a
true busy bee and partially measures its value by how many things it
crosses off my daily to-do list. Because it thinks sequentially, it is great
at mechanical manipulation. Its ability to focus on differences and
distinguishing characteristics makes it a natural builder.

My left brain is particularly gifted at identifying patterns. As a
result, it is adept at processing large volumes of information quickly. To
keep up with life's experiences in the external world, my left mind
processes information remarkably fast - much faster than my right
hemisphere, which in comparison tends to hoe-de-doe along. At times
my left mind may become manic, while my right mind has the potential
to become lazy.

This difference in speed of thought, information processing, and
output as thought, word or deed, between our two hemispheres, is in part
linked to their unique abilities to process different types of sensory
information. Our right brain perceives the longer wavelengths of light.
As a result, the visual perception of our right mind is somewhat blended
or softened. This lack of edge perception enables it to focus on the
bigger picture of how things relate to one another. Similarly, our right
mind tunes in to the lower frequencies of sound that are readily
generated by our body gurgles and other natural tones. Consequently, our
right mind is biologically designed to readily tune in to our physiology.

In contrast, our left brain perceives the shorter wavelengths of
light, increasing its ability to clearly delineate sharp boundaries. As a
result, our left mind is biologically adept at identifying separation lines
between adjacent entities. At the same time, our left hemisphere
language centers tune in to the higher frequencies of sound, which help
them detect, discriminate, and interpret tones commonly associated with
verbal language.

One of the most prominent characteristics of our left brain is its
ability to weave stories. This story-teller portion of our left mind's
language center is specifically designed to make sense of the world
outside of us, based upon minimal amounts of information. It functions
by taking whatever details it has to work with, and then weaves them
together in the form of a story. Most impressively, our left brain is
brilliant in its ability to make stuff up, and fill in the blanks when there
are gaps in its factual data. In addition, during its process of generating a
story line, our left mind is quite the genius in its ability to manufacture
alternative scenarios. And if it's a subject you really feel passionate
about, either good or awful, it's particularly effective at hooking into
those circuits of emotion and exhausting all the "what if" possibilities.

As my left brain language centers recovered and became
functional again, I spent a lot of time observing how my story-teller
would draw conclusions based upon minimal information. For the
longest time I found these antics of my story-teller to be rather comical.
At least until I realized that my left mind full-heartedly expected the rest
of my brain to believe the stories it was making up! Throughout this
resurrection of my left mind's character and skills, it has been extremely
important that I retain the understanding that my left brain is doing the
best job it can with the information it has to work with. I need to
remember, however, that there are enormous gaps between what I know
and what I think I know. I learned that I need to be very wary of my
storyteller's potential for stirring up drama and trauma.

In the same vein, as my left brain enthusiastically manufactured
stories that it promoted as the truth, it had a tendency to be redundant manifesting loops of thought patterns that reverberated through my
mind, over and over again. For many of us, these loops of thought run
rampant and we find ourselves habitually imagining devastating
possibilities. Unfortunately, as a society, we do not teach our children
that they need to _tend carefully the garden of their minds._ Without
structure, censorship, or discipline, our thoughts run rampant on
automatic. Because we have not learned how to more carefully manage
what goes on inside our brains, we remain vulnerable to not only what
other people think about us, but also to advertising and/or political
manipulation.

The portion of my left mind that I chose not to recover was the
part of my left hemisphere character that had the potential to be mean,
worry incessantly, or be verbally abusive to either myself or others.
Frankly, I just didn't like the way these attitudes felt physiologically
inside my body. My chest felt tight, I could feel my blood pressure rise,
and the tension in my brow would give me a headache. In addition, I
wanted to leave behind any of my old emotional circuits that
automatically stimulated the instant replay of painful memories. I have
found life to be too short to be preoccupied with pain from the past.

During the process of recovery, I found that the portion of my
character that was stubborn, arrogant, sarcastic, and/or jealous resided
within the ego center of that wounded left brain. This portion of my ego
mind held the capacity for me to be a sore loser, hold a grudge, tell lies,
and even seek revenge. Reawakening these personality traits was very
disturbing to the newly found innocence of my right mind. With lots of
effort, I have consciously chosen to recover my left mind's ego center
without giving renewed life to some of those old circuits.
