# 14. Milestones for Recovery

The number one question that I am most frequently asked is, "How
long did it take you to recover?" My standard response, and I don't mean
to be trite, is, "Recover what?" If we define recovery as regaining access
to old programs, then I am only partially recovered. I have been very
fussy this time around about which emotional programs I am interested
in retaining and which ones I have no interest in giving voice to again
(impatience, criticism, unkindness). What a wonderful gift this stroke
has been in permitting me to pick and choose who and how I want to be
in the world. Before the stroke, I believed I was a product of this brain
and that I had minimal say about how I felt or what I thought. Since the
hemorrhage, my eyes have been opened to how much choice I actually
have about what goes on between my ears.

Physical recovery from the brain surgery was minimal when
compared to the task of rebuilding my mind and recovering awareness of
my body. Following surgery, G.G. kept my head wound clean and the 35
stitches healed beautifully. The greatest challenge I faced was a problem
with the left temporal mandibular joint (TMJ) of my jaw due to surgery,
but with the use of a healing system called the Feldenkrais technique, it
mended quickly. The scar, however, was numb for five years and I
believe the three drill holes in
my skull completely reknitted by year six.

My mother was a very wise caregiver, and although she was
protective, she did not stand in the way of progress. In the middle of
February, two months after the stroke, I took my first solo adventure into
the world. My verbal language was good enough to keep me out of
trouble (we hoped) and I spent minimal time out and about alone. G.G.
drove me to the airport and escorted me to my seat on the plane. A
friend picked me up at the other end, so I didn't have to navigate life in
the big world for very long by myself. I relished this first leap out of the
nest as a huge step in my pursuit of independence. Based on this success,
I was encouraged to take even bigger risks.

At the three-month mark, G.G. taught me how to drive again.
Operating an enormous metal box on wheels at remarkably fast speeds
with a bunch of other busy people doing the same thing while they eat,
drink, smoke, and, oh yes, talk on their cell phones, reminded me that I
was a fragile living being and life is a precious gift. My brain was still
struggling with reading, and the hardest part of learning to drive a car
again was to remember to look for written signs. Obviously this was a
problem. And even when I did see the sign, my comprehension was
painfully slow. _So, what's that big green sign up there saying? Oh s#*?! I just passed my exit!_

By mid-March, G.G. decided I was ready to try living on my own
again. Although I was far from really being back in the game, she felt
that with the support of my friends, I was ready to try my wings. She
reassured me that if I needed her, all I had to do was call and she would
be on the first flight out. A part of me was thrilled about my increased
independence. A bigger part of me was terrified.

Within a few weeks, the first major test of my readiness to resume
my life was the gig in Fitchburg. That gave me something to concentrate
on while I began fending for myself. My friend Julie drove me to the
presentation and it went so well that I was heady with success (pun
intended).

Somehow I managed to not just survive, but to thrive again. I started
spending time on Brain Bank responsibilities on the computer from my
home. In the beginning, just a couple of hours every few days was all I
could handle. Eventually I started commuting back and forth to McLean
Hospital, a day or two a week. In actual fact, the commuting was more
difficult than the work.

To complicate matters, following surgery my doctors insisted that I
take Dilantin as a prophylactic to prevent my brain from having seizures.
I had never had a seizure, but prescribing medication is a common
practice when the temporal region of the brain has been surgically
violated. Like a typical patient, I hated my medication because it made
me feel tired and lethargic. My biggest complaint, however, was that the
medicine masked my ability to know what it felt like to be me anymore.
I was already a stranger to myself because of the stroke, but mix in some
medication and I was even more disoriented. Because of this experience,
I find that I am much more sensitive to why some people would choose
insanity over the side effects of their antipsychotic medications. I was
fortunate that my doctors agreed that I could take my entire dose at night
before I went to bed, so by morning my mind felt much clearer. I took
Dilantin for almost 2 full years following surgery.

At the six-month mark, I flew back home to Indiana to attend my
20th high school reunion. This was a perfect opportunity for me to open
files about my past. Two of my best friends escorted me around, sharing
stories about our time at Terre Haute South Vigo. The timing for this
reunion was ideal. My brain had healed enough to absorb new
information as well as open old files. Attending the reunion helped me
piece together memories of my youth. But again, in this situation,
because I was a stroke survivor, it was critical that I not see myself as
less than I had been before. Friends from my past were very kind to me
and I ended up having a great time retrieving memories.

Shortly after the reunion in June, I attended the annual NAMI
convention in July. It was the end of my three-year term on the National
Board of Directors and I was officially stepping down. I had prepared a
five minute speech to present to an audience of over 2,000 NAMI
members. With guitar in hand, tears in my eyes, and gratitude in my
heart, I thanked those wonderful people for giving me the courage to
come back. I will always cherish that box of cards they sent me,
cheering me on. I know I wouldn't be here today, in this condition, if it
hadn't been for my NAMI family.

Walking became a very important part of my routine. When you
feel like a fluid it's impossible to know where your physical boundaries
begin and end. Walking helped me become strong again, and within the
course of that first year I managed to average three miles a day several
times a week. I walked with small weights in my hands, swinging my
arms here and there, flailing them about like a wild child - but in rhythm.
I made sure I exercised all of my muscle groups -performing shoulder
girdle, shoulder, elbow, and wrist activities. Lots of people looked at me
as if I was odd, but having lost my left hemisphere ego center, I wasn't
concerned with their approval or disapproval. Walking with weights
helped me regain strength, balance, and posture. In addition, I worked
with a friend who, through the use of massage and acupuncture, helped
me identify my physical boundaries.

By the eighth month, I was back to work full time but still not
completely competent either mentally or physically. There was a
sluggishness about my brain that I could not shake. Unfortunately, my
job description involved some complex computer database
responsibilities that I knew my mind was not capable of performing.
Moreover, due to the stroke, I became acutely aware of how precious
little time I have here on the planet. I wanted to move back home to
Indiana. Spending time with my mom and dad, while I still have them
around, became a priority in my life. Fortunately, my boss agreed that I
could travel for the Brain Bank as their National Spokesperson for the
Mentally Ill from anywhere, and she gave me her blessing to return to
Indiana.

One year after the stroke, I moved back home to the Midwest. My
favorite place on earth is Bloomington, Indiana. It's the perfect-sized
college town filled with interesting and creative people - and, oh yes, it's
the home of Indiana University. Coming home to Indiana felt grounding
to me and I knew I was exactly where I was supposed to be when my
new home phone number turned out to be the exact date of my birth day,
month, and year! It was one of those synchronicities in life that let me
know that I was in the right place at the right time.

Post-stroke year two was spent reconstructing, as best I could
recall, the morning of the stroke. I worked with a _Gestalt_ therapist who
helped me verbalize my right hemisphere experience of that morning. I
believed that helping people understand what it felt like to experience
the neurological deterioration of my mind might help caregivers better
relate to stroke survivors. I also hoped that if someone read that account
and then experienced any of those symptoms, they would call for help
immediately. I worked with Jane Nevins and Sandra Ackerman of the
The Dana Foundation on a book proposal for this story. Although our
efforts were premature, I will always be grateful for their interest and
assistance in helping me outline what I valued.

Eventually, when my mind was capable of learning large volumes
of information again, it was time to reengage with academia. In my
second post-stroke year, I was hired by Rose Hulman Institute of
Technology in Terre Haute, Indiana to teach courses in
Anatomy/Physiology and Neuroscience. As I saw it, they were paying
me to relearn the details of my profession. I found that although I had
lost my academic terminology (left hemisphere), I still remembered
what everything looked like and their relationships to one another (right
hemisphere). I ended up pushing my learning ability to the limit on a
daily basis and for the entire quarter, I felt like my brain would explode
from over use. I truly believe that challenging my brain in this way was
exactly what it needed. Staying one lecture ahead of the students was
demanding. For 12 weeks, I balanced work with appropriate sleep, and
my brain performed beautifully. I will always be grateful to the Rose
Hulman Department of Applied Biology and Biomechanical
Engineering for their confidence in my ability to teach again.

To give you some idea of the chronology of my recovery, here is a
brief summary of the highlights of my progress year by year. Prior to the
stroke, I had been an avid Free Cell player (solitaire) but it was three
years before I could wrap my mind around this card game again. On the
physical plane, it took four years of walking with my hand weights,
three miles a day, several times a week, before I could walk with a
smooth rhythm. During the fourth year, my mind became capable of
multitasking - even simple things like talking on the phone while boiling
pasta. Up to that point, I had to do just one thing at a time, which meant
everything required my full attention. And along the journey, it wasn't
my style to complain. I always remembered what I had been like
immediately following the stroke, and I counted my blessings and
thanked my brain a thousand times a day for responding so well to my
attempts to revive it. Having had a taste of the alternative, I spend a
good bit of time feeling grateful for my life.

The one thing I thought I had lost forever was the ability to
understand anything mathematical. To my amazement, however, by the
fourth post-stroke year, my brain was ready to tackle addition again.
Subtraction and multiplication came online around post-stroke year four
and a half, but division eluded me until well into year five.

Working with flash cards helped me drill basic math back into my brain.
Now I work with the Nintendo™ Brain Training and Big Brain
Academy programs. I think everyone over the age of forty, as well as
every stroke survivor, would benefit from using this sort of brain
training tool.

By the end of the fifth year, I could jump from rock to rock along
the beaches in Cancun without looking at where my feet were landing.
This was a significant accomplishment, because up to this point, I had to
keep my eyes looking at the ground. The highlight of my sixth poststroke year was the fulfillment of my dream of having enough oomph in
my body to climb steps two at a time. Imagery has been an effective tool
for regaining physical functions. I am convinced that focusing on how it
feels to perform specific tasks has helped me recover them more quickly.
I had dreamed of skipping up steps every day since the stroke. I held the
memory of what it felt like to race up the steps with abandon. By
replaying this scene over and over in my mind, I kept that circuitry alive
until I could get my body and mind coordinated enough to make it
reality.

Over the years, people in my professional world have been very
generous and kind to me. Initially, I was afraid my colleagues might see
the post-stroke me as having less value and treat me patronizingly, or
perhaps even discriminate against me. Happily this has not been the
case. This stroke has not only opened my eyes to the beauty and
resiliency of the human brain, but also to the generosity of the human
spirit. Many beautiful people have nurtured my heart, and I am grateful
for all the kindnesses I have received.

Although I had been traveling part time as the _Singin' Scientist_ for
the Harvard Brain Bank since post-stroke year two, during my seventh
year, I accepted an adjunct teaching position in the Indiana University
Department of Kinesiology. In addition, teaching Gross Anatomy has
always been my greatest joy, and I began volunteering in the local IU
School of Medicine's Gross Anatomy lab. Revisiting the body and
teaching future physicians about its miraculous design has been a
thrilling privilege for me.

Also in that seventh post-stroke year, my need for sleep at night
had cut back from 11 hours to nine and a half. Up until this point, in
addition to a full night's sleep, I was a happy napper. For the first seven
years, my dreams had been a bizarre reflection of what was going on in
my brain. Instead of having dreams with people and a storyline, my
mind scrolled tiny unrelated bits of data. I presume this reflected how
my brain pieced pixilated information together to form a complete
image. It was shocking when my dreams started featuring people and a
storyline again. In the beginning, the scenes were broken and
nonsensical. By the end of that seventh year, however, my mind was so
busy during the night that I felt little refreshment upon waking.

During the eighth year of recovery, my perception of myself
finally shifted from that of being a fluid back to that of being a solid. I
began slalom water skiing regularly and I believe that pushing my body
as hard as I could helped solidify my brain/body connections. I confess
that although I celebrate being a solid again, I really miss perceiving
myself as a fluid. I miss the constant reminder that we are all _one_.

I now live what I would describe as the perfect life. I still travel for
the Harvard Brain Bank as the _Singin' Scientist._ I teach what I love Neuroanatomy and Gross Anatomy to medical students at the IU School
of Medicine. I regularly spend time as the consulting neuroanatomist at
the Midwest Proton Radiotherapy Institute (MPRI), housed at the IU
Cyclotron, where we use a precisely guided proton beam to battle
cancer. To help other stroke survivors, I'm working on the creation of a
virtual reality system whereby individuals can neurologically rehabilitate
themselves through what I call "visually directed intention."

On the physical front, I love skiing across Lake Monroe early in
the morning, and I faithfully walk around my neighborhood in the
evenings. For creativity, I play in my art space creating stained glass
wonders (mostly brains) and my guitar is a continual source of pleasure.
I still talk to my mom every day, and as the president of the local Greater
Bloomington Area NAMI affiliate, I remain active in advocacy for the
mentally ill. Helping people liberate their own inner peace, joy, and
magnificent beauty has become my personal agenda.

Over the years, I have had the opportunity to share my story with
audiences ranging from readers of _Discover Magazine,_ and Oprah
Winfrey's _O Magazine,_ to the _Stroke Connection Magazine_ of the
American Stroke Association (ASA), as well as the _Stroke Smart_
_Magazine_ of the National Stroke Association (NSA). My recovery story
has been featured on PBS's _The Infinite Mind_ and can still be heard on
the WFIU _Profiles_ program. [1] In addition, there is a wonderful PBS
program titled _Understanding: The Amazing Brain,_ which airs
internationally. I encourage you to tune in as they did a superb job
teaching about the plasticity of the brain.
