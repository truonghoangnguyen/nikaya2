# 7. Bare to the Bone

Upon my arrival at the Massachusetts General Hospital
emergency ward, I landed in the center of an energy spin that I could
only describe as a bustling beehive. My limp body felt heavy and
terribly weak. It was drained of all its energy -- like a balloon that had
been slowly and thoroughly deflated. Medical personnel swarmed
about my gurney. The sharp lights and intense sounds beat upon my
brain like a mob, demanding more attention than I could possibly
muster to appease them.

"Answer this, squeeze that, sign here!" they demanded of my
semi-consciousness, and I thought, _How absurd! Can't you see I've got a problem here? What's the matter with you people? Slow down! I can't understand you! Be patient! Hold still! That hurts! What is this chaos?_ The more tenaciously they tried to draw me out, the greater
was my ache to reach inside for my personal source of sustenance. I
felt besieged by their touching, probing, and piercing; like a slug
sprinkled with salt, I writhed in response. I wanted to scream, _Leave me alone!_ but my voice had fallen silent. They couldn't hear me
because they couldn't read my mind. I passed out like a wounded
animal, desperate to escape their manipulations.

When I first awoke later that afternoon, I was shocked to discover
that I was still alive. (Heart felt thanks to the medical professionals who
stabilized my body and gave me another chance at life - even though no
one had any idea what or how much I would ever recover.) My body was
draped in the customary hospital gown and I was resting in a private
cubicle. The bed was partially raised with my aching head slightly
elevated on a pillow. Devoid of my usual well of energy, my body sank
deep into the bed like a lump of heavy metal that I couldn't begin to
budge. I could not determine how my body was positioned, where it
began or where it ended. Without the traditional sense of my physical
boundaries, I felt that I was at _one_ with the vastness of the universe.

My head pulsed with a tormenting pain that pounded like thunder
while a white lightning storm raged theatrically upon the inside of my
eyelids. Every little shift in position that I tried to make required more
energy than my reserves held. Simply inhaling hurt my ribs, and the
light that flooded in through my eyes burned my brain like fire. Not able
to speak, I begged for the lights to be dimmed by burying my face into a
sheet.

I couldn't hear anything beyond the pounding rhythm of my heart,
which pulsed so loudly that my bones vibrated with ache and my
muscles twitched with anguish. My keen scientific mind was no longer
available to record, relate, detail, and categorize information about the
surrounding external three-dimensional space. I wanted to wail like a
colicky newborn that had been suddenly plunged into a realm of chaotic
stimulation. With my mind stripped of its ability to recall the memories
and details of my previous life, it was clear to me that I was now like an
infant - born into an adult woman's body. And oh yes, the brain wasn't
working!

Here in this emergency cubby, I could sense, over my left
shoulder, the presence of two familiar associates as they peered at a CT
scan mounted on a wall light-box. The picture on display contained
serial sections of my brain, and although

I could not decipher the words my colleagues softly shared, their body
language communicated the gravity of the situation. It didn't take
someone with a Ph.D. in neuroanatomy to figure out that the huge white
hole in the middle of the brain scan didn't belong there! My left
hemisphere was swimming in a pool of blood and my entire brain was
swollen in response to the trauma.

In silent prayer, I reflected, _I am not supposed to be here anymore! I let go! My energy shifted and the essence of my being escaped. This is not right. I don't belong here anymore! Great Spirit,_ I mused, _I am now at one with the universe. I have blended into the eternal flow and am beyond returning to this plane of life -yet I remain tethered here. The fragile mind of this organic container has shut down and is no longer amenable for intelligent occupancy! I don't belong here anymore!_
Unencumbered by any emotional connection to anyone or anything
outside of myself, my spirit was free to catch a wave in the river of
blissful flow. _Let me out!_ I hollered within my mind, _I let go! I let go!_ I
wanted to escape this vessel of physical form, which radiated chaos and
pain. In those brief moments, I felt tremendous despair that I had
survived.

My body felt cold, weighty, and ached with pain. The signals
between my brain and body were so defective that I couldn't recognize
my physical form. I felt as if I was an electrical being; an apparition of
energy smoldering around an organic lump. I had become a pile of
waste, leftovers, but I still retained a consciousness. A consciousness
that was different from the one I had known before, however, because
my left hemisphere had been packed with details about how to make
sense of the external world. These details had been organized and
ingrained as neuronal circuits in my brain. Here, in the absence of that
circuitry, I felt inanimate and awkward. My consciousness had shifted. I
was still in here -I was still me, but without the richness of the emotional
and cognitive connections my life had known. So, was I really still me?
How could I still be Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor, when I no longer shared her
life experiences, thoughts, and emotional attachments?

I remember that first day of the stroke with terrific bittersweetness. In the absence of the normal functioning of my left
orientation association area, my perception of my physical boundaries
was no longer limited to where my skin met air. I felt like a genie
liberated from its bottle. The energy of my spirit seemed to flow like a
great whale gliding through a sea of silent euphoria. Finer than the finest
of pleasures we can experience as physical beings, this absence of
physical boundary was one of glorious bliss. As my consciousness
dwelled in a flow of sweet tranquility, it was obvious to me that I would
never be able to squeeze the enormousness of my spirit back inside this
tiny cellular matrix.

My escape into bliss was a magnificent alternative to the daunting
sense of mourning and devastation I felt every time I was coaxed back
into some type of interaction with the percolating world outside of me. I
existed in some remote space that seemed to be far away from my
normal information processing, and it was clear that the "I" whom I had
grown up to be had not survived this neurological catastrophe. I
understood that that Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor died that morning, and yet, with
that said, who was left? Or, with my left hemisphere destroyed, perhaps
I should now say, who was _right_ ?

Without a language center telling me: "I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor. I
am a neuroanatomist. I live at this address and can be reached at this
phone number," I felt no obligation to being her anymore. It was truly a
bizarre shift in perception, but without her emotional circuitry reminding
me of her likes and dislikes, or her ego center reminding me about her
patterns of critical judgment, I didn't think like her anymore. From a
practical perspective, considering the amount of biological damage,
being her again wasn't even an option! In my mind, in my new
perspective, that Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor died that morning and no longer
existed. Now that I didn't know her life - her relationships, successes and
mistakes, I was no longer bound to her decisions or self-induced
limitations.

Although I experienced enormous grief for the death of my left
hemisphere consciousness - and the woman I had been, I concurrently
felt tremendous relief. That Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor had grown up with lots
of anger and a lifetime of emotional baggage that must have required a
lot of energy to sustain. She was passionate about her work and her
advocacy. She was intensely committed to living a dynamic life. But
despite her likable and perhaps even admirable characteristics, in my
present form I had not inherited her fundamental hostility. I had
forgotten about my brother and his illness. I had forgotten about my
parents and their divorce. I had forgotten about my job and all the things
in my life that brought me stress - and with this obliteration of
memories, I felt both relief and joy. I had spent a lifetime of 37 years
being enthusiastically committed to "do-do-doing" lots of stuff at a very
fast pace. On this special day, I learned the meaning of simply "being."

When I lost my left hemisphere and its language centers, I also
lost the clock that would break my moments into consecutive brief
instances. Instead of having my moments prematurely stunted, they
became open-ended, and I felt no rush to do anything. Like walking
along the beach, or just hanging out in the beauty of nature, I shifted
from the doing-consciousness of my left brain to the beingconsciousness
of my right brain. I morphed from feeling small and isolated to feeling
enormous and expansive. I stopped thinking in language and shifted to
taking new pictures of what was going on in the present moment. I was
not capable of deliberating about past or future-related ideas because
those cells were incapacitated. All I could perceive
was right here, right now, and it was beautiful.

My entire self-concept shifted as I no longer perceived myself as a
single, a solid, an entity with boundaries that separated me from the
entities around me. I understood that at the most elementary level, I am a
fluid. Of course I am a fluid! Everything around us, about us, among us,
within us, and between us is made up of atoms and molecules vibrating
in space. Although the ego center of our language center prefers defining
our _self_ as individual and solid, most of us are aware that we are made
up of trillions of cells, gallons of water, and ultimately everything about
us exists in a constant and dynamic state of activity. My left hemisphere
had been trained to perceive myself as a solid, separate from others.
Now, released from that restrictive circuitry, my right hemisphere
relished in its attachment to the eternal flow. I was no longer isolated
and alone. My soul was as big as the universe and frolicked with glee in
a boundless sea.

For many of us, thinking about ourselves as fluid, or with souls as
big as the universe, connected to the energy flow of all that is, slips us
out just beyond our comfort zone. But without the judgment of my left
brain saying that I am a solid, my perception of myself returned to this
natural state of fluidity. Clearly, we are each trillions upon trillions of
particles in soft vibration. We exist as fluid-filled sacs in a fluid world
where everything exists in motion. Different entities are composed of
different densities of molecules but ultimately every pixel is made up of
electrons, protons, and neutrons performing a delicate dance. Every
pixel, including every iota of you and me, and every pixel of space
seemingly in between, is atomic matter and energy. My eyes could no
longer perceive things as things that were separate from one another.
Instead, the energy of everything blended together. My visual processing
was no longer normal. (I compare this pixilated perspective to
Impressionist pointillism paintings.)

I was consciously alert and my perception was that I was in the
flow. Everything in my visual world blended together, and with every
pixel radiating energy we all flowed _en masse,_ together as _one._ It was
impossible for me to distinguish the physical boundaries between objects
because everything radiated with similar energy. It's probably
comparable to when people take off their glasses or put eye drops into
their eyes - the edges become softer.

In this state of mind, I could not perceive three-dimensionally.
Nothing stood out as being closer or farther away. If there was a person
standing in a doorway, I could not distinguish their presence until they
moved. It took activity for me to know that I should pay special attention
to any particular patch of molecules. In addition, color did not register to
my brain as color. I simply couldn't distinguish it.

Prior to this morning when I had experienced myself as a solid, I
had possessed the ability to experience loss -either physical loss via
death or injury, or emotional loss through heartache. But in this shifted
perception, it was impossible for me to perceive either physical or
emotional loss because I was not capable of experiencing separation or
individuality. Despite my neurological trauma, an unforgettable sense of
peace pervaded my entire being and I felt calm.

Although I rejoiced in my perception of connection to all that is, I
shuddered at the awareness that I was no longer a normal human being.
How on earth would I exist as a member of the human race with this
heightened perception that we are each a part of it all, and that the life
force energy within each of us contains the power of the universe? How
could I fit in with our society when I walk the earth with no fear? I was,
by anyone's standard, no longer normal. In my own unique way, I had
become severely mentally ill. And I must say, there was both freedom
and challenge for me in recognizing that our perception of the external
world, and our relationship to it, is a product of our neurological
circuitry. For all those years of my life, I really had been a figment of my
own imagination!

When the time keeper in my left hemisphere shut down, the
natural temporal cadence of my life s-l-o-w-e-d to the pace of a snail. As
my perception of time shifted, I fell out of sync with the beehive that
bustled around me. My consciousness drifted into a time warp, rendering
me incapable of communicating or functioning at either the accustomed
or acceptable pace of social exchange. I now existed in a world between
worlds. I could no longer relate to people outside of me, and yet my life
had not been extinguished. I was not only an oddity to those around me,
but on the inside, I was an oddity to myself.

I felt so detached from my ability to move my body with any
oomph that I truly believed I would never be able to get this collection
of cells to perform again. Wasn't it interesting that although I could not
walk or talk, understand language, read or write, or even roll my body
over, I knew that I was okay? The now off-line intellectual mind of my
left hemisphere no longer inhibited my innate awareness that I was the
miraculous power of life. I knew I was different now
- but never once did my right mind indicate that I was "less than" what I
had been before. I was simply a being of light radiating life into the
world. Regardless of whether or not I had a body or brain that could
connect me to the world of others, I saw myself as a cellular
masterpiece. In the absence of my left hemisphere's negative judgment, I
perceived myself as perfect, whole, and beautiful just the way I was.

You may be wondering how it is that I still remember everything
that happened. I remind you that although I was mentally disabled, I was
not unconscious. Our consciousness is created by numerous programs
that are running at the same time. Each program adds a new dimension
to our ability to perceive things in the three-dimensional world.
Although I had lost my left hemisphere consciousness containing my
ego center and ability to see my _self_ as a single and solid entity separate
from you, I retained both the consciousness of my right mind and the
consciousness of the cells making up my body. Although one set of
programs was no longer functioning - the one that reminded me moment
by moment of who I was and where I lived, etc., the other parts of me
remained alert and continued processing instantaneous information. In
the absence of my traditional left hemispheric domination over my right
mind, other parts of my brain emerged. Programs that had been inhibited
were now free to run and I was no longer fettered to my previous
interpretation of perception. With this shift away from my left
hemisphere consciousness and the character I had been, my right
hemisphere character emerged with new insight.

To hear others tell the story, however, I was quite a mess that day. I
was like a newborn unable to make sense of the sensory stimulation in
the physical space around me. It was obvious that I perceived incoming
stimulation as painful. Sound streaming in through my ears blasted my
brain senseless so that when people spoke, I could not distinguish their
voices from the underlying clatter of the environment. From my
perspective, everyone clamored en masse and resonated like a
discordant pack of restless animals. Inside my head, I felt as though my
ears were no longer tightly connected to my brain, and I sensed that
important information was seeping out between the cracks.

I wanted to communicate: _Yelling louder does not help me understand you any better! Don't be afraid of me. Come closer to me. Bring me your gentle spirit. Speak more slowly. Enunciate more clearly. Again! Please, try again! S-l-o-w down. Be kind to me. Be a safe place for me. See that I am a wounded animal, not a stupid animal. I am vulnerable and confused. Whatever my age, whatever my credentials, reach for me. Respect me. I am in here. Come find me._

Earlier that morning, I never entertained the possibility that I was
orchestrating my rescue so that I would live out the rest of my days
completely disabled. Yet, at the core of my being, my conscious mind
felt so detached from my physical body that I sincerely believed I would
never be able to fit the energy of me back inside this skin, nor ever be
able to reengage the intricate networks of my body's cellular and
molecular tapestry. I felt suspended between two worlds, caught between
two perfectly opposite planes of reality. For me, hell existed inside the
pain of this wounded body as it failed miserably in any attempt to
interact with the external world, while heaven existed in a consciousness
that soared in eternal bliss. And yet, somewhere deep within me, there
was a jubilant being, thrilled that I had survived!
