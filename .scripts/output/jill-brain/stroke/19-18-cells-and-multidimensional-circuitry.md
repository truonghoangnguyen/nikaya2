# 18. Cells And Multidimensional Circuitry

My good friend Dr. Jerry Jesseph lives his life by the
philosophy "Peacefulness should be the place we begin rather than
the place we try to achieve." I interpret this to mean that we should
stem from the peaceful consciousness of our right mind and use the
skills of our left mind to interact with the external world. He has
also coined the phrase "dual interpenetrating awarenesses" to
describe the relationship between the two halves of our brain. I
think this is a profound and accurate perspective. Thanks to our
corpus callosum, our two hemispheres are so intricately interwoven
that we perceive ourselves as a single individual. However, through
our understanding that we have two very distinct ways of being in
the world, we can deliberately choose to have much more power
over what's going on inside our brains than we ever imagined!

My left brain became competent again when it regained the
ability to process information at fast rates of speed. Now that it is
completely back online, it tends to reengage with life at what feels
like a million miles an hour. Needless to say, the natural
competition between my left hemisphere language centers and my
right hemisphere's experience of inner peace has grounded me back
in the normal human condition. A part of me is thrilled to be so
functional again. A bigger part of me is terrified.

This experience of losing my left brain has opened my mind to
look more positively at people who have experienced various forms of
brain trauma. I often wonder, in the absence of language or the ability to
communicate with others in a normal way, what insights or abilities has
that person gained? I don't feel sorry for people who are different from
me or perceived as not normal anymore. I realize that pity is not an
appropriate response. Instead of feeling repelled by someone who is
different, I am drawn toward them with kindness and curiosity. I am
fascinated by their uniqueness and compelled to establish a meaningful
connection, even if it is merely direct eye contact, a kind smile, or
appropriate touch.

When I take responsibility for the circumstances of my life, I put
myself in the driver's seat and own my power. In an attempt to maintain
my sanity (peaceful heart) in a world that often feels like it spins
dangerously fast, I continue to work very hard to maintain a healthy
relationship between what is going on in my right and left minds. I love
knowing that I am simultaneously (depending on which hemisphere you
ask) as big as the universe and yet merely a heap of star dust.

Everyone's brain is different but let me share with you some of the
simple things I have found to be true for mine. It seems that the more
aware I am about how I am influencing the energies around me, the
more say I have in what comes my way. To monitor how things are
going in my life, I pay very close attention to how things are flowing, or
not flowing in the world around me. Depending on what I am attracting,
I take responsibility for how things are going and consciously make
adjustments along the way. This does not mean that I am in complete
control of everything that happens to me. However, I am in control of
how I choose to think and feel about those things. Even negative events
can be perceived as valuable life lessons, if I am willing to _step to the right_ and experience the situation with compassion.

Now that my left mind's language centers and storyteller are back
to functioning normally, I find my mind not only spins a wild tale but
has a tendency to hook into negative patterns of thought. I have found
that the first step to getting out of these reverberating loops of negative
thought or emotion is to recognize when I am hooked into those loops.
For some of us, paying attention to what our brain is saying to us comes
naturally. Many of my college students, however, complain vehemently
that it takes way too much mental effort for them to simply observe what
their brain is telling them. Learning to listen to your brain from the
position of a nonjudgmental witness may take some practice and
patience, but once you master this awareness, you become free to step
beyond the worrisome drama and trauma of your story-teller.

When I become conscious of what cognitive loops my brain is
running, I then focus on how these loops feel physiologically inside my
body. Do I feel alert? Are my eyes dilated? Is my breath deep or
shallow? Do I feel tightness in my chest? Do I feel lightness in my head?
Is my stomach upset? Do I feel antsy or anxious? Are my legs jiggling?
Neuronal loops (circuits) of fear, anxiety or anger, can be triggered by all
sorts of different stimulation. But once triggered, these different
emotions produce a predictable physiological response that you can train
yourself to consciously observe.

When my brain runs loops that feel harshly judgmental, counterproductive, or out of control, I wait 90 seconds for the
emotional/physiological response to dissipate and then I speak to my
brain as though it is a group of children. I say with sincerity, "I
appreciate your ability to think thoughts and feel emotions, but I am
really not interested in thinking these thoughts or feeling these emotions
anymore. Please stop bringing this stuff up."

Essentially, I am consciously asking my brain to stop hooking into
specific thought patterns. Different people do it differently of course.
Some folks just use the phrase, "Cancel! Cancel!" or they exclaim to
their brain, "Busy! I'm too busy!" Or they say "Enough, enough, enough
already! Knock it off!"

Simply thinking these thoughts with my inner authentic voice,
however, is often not enough for me to get the message across to my
story-teller, who is invested in performing its normal function. I have
found that when I attach an appropriate feeling to these phrases, and
think them with genuine affect, my story-teller is more amenable to this
type of communication. If I'm really having trouble getting my brain to
listen, I add a kinesthetic component to my message like waggling my
pointed finger in the air, or standing firm with my hands on my hips. A
scolding mother is more effective when she says what she means with
passion and communicates her message multidimensionally.

I whole-heartedly believe that 99.999 percent of the cells in my
brain and body want me to be happy, healthy, and successful. A tiny
portion of the story-teller, however, does not seem to be unconditionally
attached to my joy, and is excellent at exploring thought patterns that
have the potential to really derail my feeling of inner peace. This group
of cells has been called many things; some of my favorites include the
Peanut Gallery, the Board of Directors, and the Itty Bitty S#*?!y
Committee. These are the cells in our verbal mind that are totally
resourceful in their ability to run our loops of doom and gloom. These
cells tap into our negative attributes of jealousy, fear, and rage. They
thrive when they are whining, complaining, and sharing with everyone
about how awful everything is.

In extreme situations of cellular disregard, I use my authentic
voice to put my language center's Peanut Gallery on a strict time
schedule. I give my story-teller full permission to whine rampantly
between 9-9:30am and then again between 9-9:30pm. If it accidentally
misses _whine time,_ it is not allowed to reengage in that behavior until its
next allotted appointment. My cells quickly get the message that I am
serious about not hooking into those negative loops of thought - but only
if I am persistent and determined enough to pay attention to what
circuits are running in my brain.

I'm a devout believer that paying attention to our selftalk is vitally
important for our mental health. In my opinion, making the decision that
internal verbal abuse is not acceptable behavior, is the first step toward
finding deep inner peace. It has been extremely empowering for me to
realize that the negative story-teller portion of my brain is only about the
size of a peanut! Just imagine how sweet life was when those cranky
cells were silent. Recovering my left mind has meant that I have had to
give voice to all of my cells again. However, I have learned that in order
to protect my overall mental health, it is necessary for me to tend the
garden of my mind and keep these cells in check. I have found that my
story-teller simply needs a little disciplining directive from my
conscious mind about what I want versus what I find unacceptable.
Thanks to our open line of communication, my authentic self has much
more say over what is going on with this particular group of cells; and I
spend very little time hooked into unwanted or inappropriate thought
patterns.

Having said that, however, I am often humored by the scheming
antics of my story-teller in response to this type of directive. I have
found that just like little children, these cells may challenge the authority
of my authentic voice and test my conviction. Once asked to be silent,
they tend to pause for a moment and then immediately reengage those
forbidden loops. If I am not persistent with my desire to think about
other things, and consciously initiate new circuits of thought, then those
uninvited loops can generate new strength and begin monopolizing my
mind again. To counter their activities, I keep a handy list of three things
available for me to turn my consciousness toward when I am in a state of
need: 1) I remember something I find fascinating that I would like to
ponder more deeply, 2) I think about something that brings me terrific
joy, or 3) I think about something I would like to do. When I am
desperate to change my mind, I use such tools.

I have also found that when I am least expecting it -feeling either
physically tired or emotionally vulnerable -those negative circuits have a
tendency to raise their hurtful heads. The more aware I remain about
what my brain is saying and how those thoughts feel inside my body, the
more I own my power in choosing what I want to spend my time
thinking about and how I want to feel. If I want to retain my inner peace,
I must be willing to consistently and persistently _tend the garden of my mind_ moment by moment, and be willing to make the decision a
thousand times a day.

Our patterns of thought are grounded in rich multidimensional
circuitry that we can learn to scrutinize. First, each thought pattern has a
subject - something that I am cognitively thinking about. For example,
let's say I am thinking about my little dog Nia, who spent a good share
of her last eight years sitting on my lap, helping me write this book.
Thinking about Nia is a specific circuit in my brain. Second, each
thought pattern may or may not be accompanied by an adjoining
emotional circuit of which I am cognizant. In the case of Nia, I generally
experience great joy when I think of her because she was a marvelously
loving creature. In my brain, the subject circuitry of Nia and the
emotional circuitry of joy are intimately linked. Finally, these specific
circuits of thought and emotion may also be linked with some of my
more complex physiological circuitry, which upon stimulation would
result in predictable behavior.

For example: when I think about Nia (thought circuitry) I
experience the feeling of joy (emotional circuitry) and more often than
not, I experience great excitement (physiological circuitry) and engage
in puppy-like behavior (multidimensional circuitry). I instantly revert to
a childlike voice and my eyes dilate. My joy becomes palpable, and I
spontaneously waggle my body as if I were wagging my tail! Yet, in
addition to this circuitry of excitement and animation, on other occasions
I am also inclined to respond to the thought of Nia with consuming
sadness - as I mourn the loss of my beloved four-legged friend. In the
instant of a shifted thought, and its underlying emotional and
physiological circuitry, my eyes might well up with tears. Caught in the
loop of deep grief, my chest tightens, my breathing becomes shallow,
and emotionally I feel depressed. Feeling weak in the knees, my energy
wanes and I succumb to loops of darkness.

These passionate thoughts and feelings have the potential to jump
instantly into my mind, but again, after their 90 seconds have come and
gone, I have the power to consciously choose which emotional and
physiological loops I want to hook into. I believe it is vital to our health
that we pay very close attention to how much time we spend hooked into
the circuitry of anger, or the depths of despair. Getting caught up in these
emotionally charged loops for long periods of time can have devastating
consequences on our physical and mental well-being because of the
power they have over our emotional and physiological circuitry.
However, with that said, it is equally important that we honor these
emotions when they surge through us. When I am moved by my
automatic circuitry, I thank my cells for their capacity to experience that
emotion, and then I make the choice to return my thoughts to the present
moment.

Finding the balance between _observing_ our circuitry and _engaging_
with our circuitry is essential for our healing. Although I celebrate my
brain's ability to experience all of my emotions, I am cautious about how
long I remain hooked into running any particular loop. The healthiest
way I know how to move through an emotion effectively is to surrender
completely to that emotion when its loop of physiology comes over me.
I simply resign to the loop and let it run its course for 90 seconds. Just
like children, emotions heal when they are heard and validated. Over
time, the intensity and frequency of these circuits usually abate.

Really powerful thoughts are perceived as powerful because they
simultaneously run multiple circuits of emotion and physiology.
Thoughts that we would define as neutral are perceived as neutral
because they are not stimulating complex circuitry. Paying attention to
which array of circuits we are concurrently running provides us with
tremendous insight into how our minds are fundamentally wired, and
consequentially, how we can more effectively tend our garden.

In addition to spending a lot of time conversing with my brain
cells, I'm having a big love-fest with the fifty trillion molecular geniuses
making up my body. I am so grateful that they are alive and working
together in perfect harmony that I implicitly trust them to bring me
health. The first thing every morning and the last thing every night, I
faithfully hug my pillow, wrap one hand in the other, and consciously
thank my cells for another great day. I care enough to say it out loud.
"Thank you girls. Thanks for another great day!," and I say it with an
intense feeling of gratitude in my heart. I then implore my cells, _Please, heal me,_ and I visualize my immune cells responding.

I unconditionally love my cells with an open heart and grateful
mind. Spontaneously throughout the day, I acknowledge their existence
and enthusiastically cheer them on. I am a wonderful living being
capable of beaming my energy into the world, only because of them.
When my bowels move, I cheer my cells for clearing that waste out of
my body. When my urine flows, I admire the volume my bladder cells
are capable of storing. When I'm having hunger pangs and can't get to
food, I remind my cells that I have fuel (fat) stored on my hips. When I
feel threatened, I thank my cells for their ability to fight, flee, or play
dead.

At the same time, I listen to my body when it speaks to me. If I
feel tired, I give my cells sleep. When I'm feeling sloth-like, I give my
cells movement. When I'm in pain, I become quiet, coddle the wound,
and consciously surrender into the pain, which helps it dissipate. Pain is
the tool our cells use to communicate to our brain that there is trauma
somewhere in our body. Our cells stimulate our pain receptors in order
to get our brain to focus and pay attention. Once my brain acknowledges
the existence of the pain, then it has served its purpose and either
lightens up in intensity, or goes away.

From my perspective, the focused human mind is the most
powerful instrument in the universe, and through the use of language,
our left brain is capable of directing (or impeding) our physical healing
and recovery. My verbal left ego mind functions as the head-cheerleader
of my fifty trillion molecular geniuses, and when I periodically
encourage my cells with _You go girls!,_ I can't help but think this induces
some sort of vibration within my body that promotes a healing
environment. I'm a believer that when my cells are healthy and happy, I
am healthy and happy.

None of this is to say that people with true mental illness have the
capacity to choose completely what is going on inside their brains.
However, I do believe that all symptoms of severe mental illness stem
from a biological basis: which cells are communicating with which cells,
with which chemicals and in what quantities of those chemicals. Brain
research is on the cutting edge of understanding the neurocircuitry
underlying mental illness, and as our knowledge grows, there will be a
greater understanding about how we can help people more effectively
monitor and tend to the health of their minds.

For treatment options, we have the capacity to influence our brain
cells chemically through the use of medication, electrically via electrical
stimulation, and cognitively through psychotherapy. In my opinion, the
purpose of medical treatment is to increase our ability to share a
common reality. I am in favor of people exploring what resources might
help them more readily connect with others. Unfortunately, 60% of
people diagnosed with schizophrenia do not recognize that they are ill.
As a result, they do not seek or value treatment and often engage in
selfmedication through the abuse of drugs or alcohol. Even the
recreational use of these substances (by anyone) decreases our ability to
share a common reality, and can thus be counterproductive to one's
health.

Although some individuals advocate for the right to be insane, I
am of the opinion that it is everyone's civil right to experience sanity and
share in a common reality - whatever the cause of their brain illness or
trauma.
