# ONE JILL'S PRE-STROKE LIFE
I am a trained and published neuroanatomist. I grew up in Terre
Haute, Indiana. One of my older brothers, who is only 18 months older
than I, is diagnosed with the brain disorder schizophrenia. He was
officially diagnosed at the age of 31, but showed obvious signs of
psychosis for many years prior to that. During our childhood, he was
very different from me in the way he experienced reality and chose to
behave. As a result, I became fascinated with the human brain at an early
age. I wondered how it could be possible that my brother and I could
share the same experience but walk away from the situation with
completely different interpretations about what had just happened. This
difference in perception, information processing, and output motivated
me to become a brain scientist.

My undergraduate academic journey began at Indiana University
in Bloomington, Indiana in the late 1970s. Because of my interactions
with my brother, I was hungry to understand what "normal" was at a
neurological level. At that time, the subject of neuroscience was such a
young field that it was not yet offered on the IU campus as a formal area
of specialization. By studying both physiological psychology and human
biology, I learned as much as I could about the human brain.

My first real job in the world of medical science turned out to be
an enormous blessing in my life. I was hired as a lab technician at the
Terre Haute Center for Medical Education (THCME), which is a branch
of the Indiana University School of Medicine hosted on the campus of

Indiana State University (ISU). My time was evenly divided between the
medical human gross anatomy lab and the neuroanatomy research lab.
For two years, I was immersed in medical education and, while
mentored by Dr. Robert C. Murphy, I fell in love with dissecting the
human body.

Bypassing the master's degree, I spent the next six years officially
enrolled in the ISU Department of Life Science Ph.D. program. My
course load was dominated by the first-year medical school curriculum,
and my research specialty was neuroanatomy under the guidance of Dr.
William J. Anderson. In 1991, I received my doctorate and felt
competent to teach Human Gross Anatomy, Human Neuroanatomy, and
Histology at the medical school level.

In 1988, during my time at the THCME and ISU, my brother was
officially diagnosed with schizophrenia. Biologically, he is the closest
thing to me that exists in the universe. I wanted to understand why I
could take my dreams and connect them to reality and make my dreams
come true. What was different about my brother's brain such that he
could not connect his dreams to a common reality and they instead
became delusions? I was eager to pursue research in schizophrenia.

Following commencement from ISU, I was offered a postdoctoral
research position at Harvard Medical School in the Department of
Neuroscience. I spent two years working with Dr. Roger Tootell on the
localization of Area MT, which is located in the part of the brain's visual
cortex that tracks movement. I was interested in this project because a
high percentage of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia exhibit
abnormal eye behavior when watching moving objects. After helping
Roger anatomically identify Area MT's
location in the human brain, [1] I followed my heart and transferred into
the Harvard Medical School Department of Psychiatry. It was my goal to
work in the lab of Dr. Francine M. Benes at McLean Hospital. Dr. Benes
is a world-renowned expert in the postmortem investigation of the
human brain as it relates to schizophrenia. I believed this would be how
I could make my contribution to helping people stricken with the same
brain disorder as my brother.

The week before I began my new position at McLean Hospital, my
dad Hal and I flew to Miami to attend the 1993 annual conference of
NAMI, the National Alliance on Mental Illness. [2] Hal, a retired
Episcopalian minister with a Ph.D. in counseling psychology, had
always been an advocate for social justice. We were both motivated to
attend this convention to learn more about NAMI and what we could do
to merge our energy with theirs. NAMI is the largest grassroots
organization dedicated to improving the lives of persons living with
serious mental illness. At that time, NAMI had a membership of
approximately 40,000 families with a loved one who is psychiatricallydiagnosed. Now NAMI has a membership of approximately 220,000 families. The National NAMI organization advocates at the national
level while the State NAMIs advocate at the state level. In addition,
there are over 1100 local NAMI affiliates scattered around the country
providing support, education, and advocacy opportunities for families at
the community level.

That trip to Miami changed my life. A group of around 1,500
people, comprised of parents, siblings, offspring, and individuals
diagnosed with severe mental illness, gathered together for support,
education, advocacy, and research-related issues. Until I met other
siblings of individuals with mental illness, I had not realized what a
profound impact my brother's illness had had on my life. In the course of
those few days, I found a family of people who understood the anguish I
felt at the loss of my brother to his schizophrenia. They understood my
family's struggle to help him access quality treatment. They fought
together as an organized voice against the social injustice and stigma
related to mental illness. They were armed with educational programs
for themselves, as well as for the public, about the biological nature of
these disorders. Equally important, they rallied with the brain
researchers to help find a cure. I felt that I was in the right place at the
right time. I was a sibling, a scientist and passionate about helping
people like my brother. In my soul I felt that I had found not only a
cause worthy of my effort, but also an extended family.

The week after the Miami convention, I arrived at McLean
Hospital stoked and eager to start my new job in the Laboratory for
Structural Neuroscience, the research domain of Dr. Francine Benes. I
was all a-buzz and thrilled to begin my postmortem investigations into
the biological basis of schizophrenia. Francine, whom I affectionately
call the "Queen of Schizophrenia," is an amazing research scientist. Just
watching how she thinks, how she explores and how she pieces together
what she learns from data was a total joy for me. It was a privilege to
witness her creativity in experimental design and her persistence,
precision, and efficiency in running a research lab. This job was a dream
come true. Studying the brains of individuals diagnosed with
schizophrenia brought me a feeling of purpose.

On the first day of my new job, however, Francine threw me for a
loop when she informed me that the infrequency of brain donations from
families of individuals with mental illness had created a long-term
shortage of brain tissue for postmortem investigation. I couldn't believe
what I was hearing. I had just spent the better half of a week at National
NAMI with hundreds of other families with
members diagnosed with severe mental illness. Dr. Lew Judd, a former
director of the National Institute of Mental Health, had moderated the
research plenary, and several leading scientists had presented their
research. NAMI families love sharing and learning about brain research,
so I found it mind-boggling that there could be a lack of donated tissue. I
decided this was merely a public awareness issue. I believed that once
NAMI families knew that there was a research tissue shortage, they
would promote brain donation within the organization and resolve the
problem.

The next year (1994), I was elected to the National NAMI Board
of Directors. It was a thrill for me to be of service to this wonderful
organization, a huge honor and responsibility. Of course, the base of my
platform was the value of brain donation and the shortage of
psychiatrically-diagnosed tissue available for scientists to do their work.
I called it the "Tissue Issue." At the time, the average age of a NAMI
member was 67 years old. I was only 35. I felt proud to be the youngest
person ever elected to this board. I had lots of energy and was raring to
go.

With my new status within the National NAMI organization, I
immediately began keynoting at State NAMI annual conventions all
around the country. Before I began this venture, the Harvard Brain
Tissue Resource Center (Brain Ban ~~k~~ [2] ~~)~~, which was positioned right next
to the Benes Lab, was receiving fewer than three brains a year from
psychiatrically-diagnosed individuals. This was barely enough tissue for
Francine's lab to do its work, much less for the Brain Bank to supply
tissue to the other reputable labs that requested it. Within a few months
of my traveling around and educating our NAMI families about the
"Tissue Issue," the number of brain donations began to increase.
Currently, the number of donations from the psychiatrically-diagnosed
population ranges from 25-35 per year. The scientific community would
make good use of 100 per year.

I realized that early on in my "Tissue Issue" presentations, the
subject of brain donation would make some of my audience members
squirm uncomfortably. There was this predictable moment when my
audience would realize, "Oh my gosh, she wants MY brain!" And I
would say to them, "Well yes, yes I do, but don't worry, I'm in no hurry!"
To combat their obvious apprehension, I wrote the Brain Bank jingle
titled "1-800-BrainBank!" [3] and began traveling with my guitar as the
_Singin' Scientist._ _[4]_ As I neared the subject of brain donation and the
tension in the room began to rise, I'd pull out my guitar and sing for
them. The Brain Bank jingle seems to be just goofy enough to
effectively dampen the tension, open hearts, and make it okay for me to
communicate my message.

My efforts with NAMI brought deep meaning to my life and my
work in the lab flourished. My primary research project in the Benes lab
involved working with Francine to create a protocol where we could
visualize three neurotransmitter systems in the same piece of tissue.
Neurotransmitters are the chemicals with which brain cells
communicate. This was important work since the newer atypical
antipsychotic medications are designed to influence multiple
neurotransmitter systems rather than just one. Our ability to visualize
three different systems in the same piece of tissue increased our ability
to understand the delicate interplay between these systems. It was our
goal to better understand the microcircuitry of the brain - which cells in
which areas of the brain communicate with which chemicals and in what
quantities of those chemicals. The better we
understood what the differences were, at a cellular level, between the
brains of individuals diagnosed with a severe mental illness and normal
control brains, the closer the medical community would be to helping
those in need with appropriate medications. In the spring of 1995, this
work was featured on the cover of _BioTechniques Journal_ and in 1996 it
won me the prestigious Mysell Award from the Harvard Medical School
Department of Psychiatry. I loved working in the lab and I loved sharing
this work with my NAMI family.

And then the unthinkable happened. I was in my mid-thirties and
thriving both professionally and personally. But in one fell swoop, the
rosiness of my life and promising future evaporated. I woke up on
December 10, 1996, to discover that I had a brain disorder of my own. I
was having a stroke. Within four brief hours, I watched my mind
completely deteriorate in its ability to process all stimulation coming in
through my senses. This rare form of hemorrhage rendered me
completely disabled whereby I could not walk, talk, read, write, or recall
any aspects of my life.

I realize you are probably eager to begin reading the personal
account of the morning of the stroke. However, in order for you to more
clearly understand what was going on inside my brain, I have chosen to
present some simple science in Chapters Two and Three. Please don't let
this section scare you away. I have done my best to keep it user-friendly
with lots of simple pictures of the brain so you can understand the

anatomy underlying my cognitive, physical, and spiritual experiences. If
you absolutely must skip these chapters, then rest assured they will be
here for you as a reference. I encourage you to read this section first,
however, as I believe it will profoundly simplify your understanding.
