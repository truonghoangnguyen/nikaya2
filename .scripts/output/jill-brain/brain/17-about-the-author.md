# ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Jill Bolte Taylor spends most of her year aboard an 80-foot riverboat in a
beautiful cove on a lake in the Southeast. Accompanied by her constant
companions Bella and Finley, she spends her time writing, paddleboarding,
rowing, and entertaining friends and family when they come out to play.

During the colder months, Jill continues to keynote, and wanders the
world as though it is her backyard as she educates the public about the
beauty and resiliency of our beautiful brain. She values sunshine, adventure,
and deep connection with nature and others.
