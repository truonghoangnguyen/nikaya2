# BRAIN ANATOMY AND PERSONALITY

My father, Hal Taylor, was a preacher man. He was an ordained and
practicing Episcopalian minister during my childhood, and when I was a
teenager he became a therapist after receiving his Ph.D. in counseling
psychology. Hal was fascinated with people of all walks of life and earned
his living helping corporations and nonprofit organizations develop teambuilding skills for better board management and performance. He did this
using personality profiles and temperament typing.

Hal was obsessed with helping people help themselves, be they
presidents of organizations, the severely mentally ill, or those incarcerated
in our jails. Hal had a heart of gold, and his single goal in life, in my
opinion, was to help people better understand their strengths so they could
live more fully. Temperament typing was a great tool for this. His primary
tool was the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which was very popular back in
the 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s and is still being used by over a million people a

year.

The first time Hal gave me the Myers-Briggs, I was 18 years old and
starting college. Like many others I rebelled against the forced-choice
nature of the exam because my answers were completely dependent on the
circumstances in which I pictured myself. I originally tested as an INTJ—
an Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging personality. This profile,
labeled by psychologist and temperament-typing expert David Keirsey as
the Scientist, clearly depicted a character inside of me, but I was that
character only part of the time. When hanging out with my friends, I was an
ESFP Performer type—Extroverted, Sensing, Feeling, and Perceiving. So
much so that I was voted class clown in high school.

The Myers-Briggs did not accommodate for different life scenarios, and
because it pigeonholed me into a single character, I questioned the accuracy
of the evaluation. This sparked in me a lifelong curiosity and drive to find a
psychological typing system that was more anatomically accurate.

Following in my father’s footsteps, I became fascinated with psychology
and the brain, as well as with the relationships between our mind, brain,
body, and behavior. I loved anything that was human-based biology.



### **THE SPLIT-BRAIN EXPERIMENTS**

To my good fortune, I was an undergraduate during the late ’70s, when
the field of neuroscience went mainstream and the famous split-brain
surgeries captivated the public’s attention. To say the least, I was riveted by
the work of Dr. Roger Sperry, who surgically separated the two cerebral
hemispheres of several of his epileptic patients.

When Dr. Sperry surgically cut the corpus callosum—the band of some
300 million axonal fibers connecting the two cerebral hemispheres—in a
procedure called a commissurotomy, he was successful in preventing
dangerous seizure activity in one hemisphere from spreading into the other.
There was another benefit too: the psychological experiments that were
performed on this patient population by Dr. Michael Gazzaniga bore great
insights into how our two brain hemispheres function differently when they
are separated.

As a budding neuroscientist, I was particularly fascinated by the Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde stories from these experiments, which depicted the
psychological and underlying anatomical abilities of the two cerebral
hemispheres as dramatically different. It was clear that when the two
hemispheres were separated, the split-brain patients behaved as though they
were two unique characters that often acted in direct opposition to one
another.

In some of these patients, the character “occupying” the right brain
hemisphere would directly contradict the intention and behavior of the
character “occupying” the left brain hemisphere. For instance, when one
gentleman attempted to slap his wife with his left hand (right brain), he
simultaneously protected her with his right hand (left brain). On another
occasion this same fellow was clearly conflicted when he yanked his pants
down with one hand while simultaneously redressing himself with the other.

A different patient, who happened to be a child, was completely verbal in
both of his hemispheres. When asked about his life goals, his right-brain
character reported that he wanted to grow up to be a race car driver, while
his left-brain character was interested in becoming a draftsman. Still
another commissurotomy patient reported that she went to battle with

herself every morning when choosing her clothing. She described her right
and left hands as two repelling magnets, each of which had different styles
in mind about what she should wear that day. The same thing happened
when she was shopping for food at the grocery store, as her two
hemispheric characters were interested in completely different cuisines. It
took well over a year following her commissurotomy surgery before she
was able to master a single intention and purposefully inhibit the internal
battle going on between her two differently opinionated hemispheric
characters.

As you hear these stories, it is important to note that the only anatomical
difference between these commissurotomy patients and you and me is that
our two cerebral hemispheres communicate with one another via the
connections of our corpus callosum. Scientists understand that
neuroanatomically the majority of these commissural fibers are inhibitory in
nature and that they run from one set of cells in one hemisphere to the
comparable set of cells in the opposite hemisphere. At any moment in time,
both hemispheres have cells that are active, but opposing hemisphere cell
groups dance between dominance and inhibition.

In this way, one hemisphere has the power to inhibit the function of the
comparable cells in the opposite hemisphere, dominating the function of
that particular group of cells. For example, when we are focused on the
words and meaning of what someone is saying (left brain), we tend to not
be so focused on the inflection of their voice or the emotional content (right
brain) of what they are communicating. Vice versa—have you ever been so
stunned that someone was yelling at you that you completely missed the
point they were trying to make?

Back in the ’70s and ’80s, society went a bit overboard in its response to
the split-brain studies, and all sorts of “right brain” and “left brain”–based
community programs popped up. Many schools even got into the game and
established curricula that would help stimulate one or both of the
hemispheres. The stereotypes of left-brain and right-brain people entered
the mainstream, with the left-brainers appearing to be more organized,
punctual, and good with details while the right-brainers thrived in creativity,
innovation, and athletics.

Unfortunately, in response to the left-brain/right-brain craze, the strategy
that many parents took to help their children get ahead was to expose them
to programming that fit their natural dominance. This makes sense, of

course, since they wanted their children to be rewarded for what they did
well. But if their goal was to create more rounded, whole-brained children,
a better plan might have been for them to encourage their kids to partake in
activities at which they did _not_ excel. For example, they could have
encouraged the left brain–dominant science and math types to participate in
outdoor events in which they could explore and collect data in the woods.
And they could have enticed the athletic and artistic types to creatively
design some really cool science-fair projects that would measure some type
of performance.

Because parents did it the way they did, however, over the last 40 years
we have skewed our abilities toward the two extremes. There have been
some writings and teachings specifically designed to help develop our
nondominant side, including the book _Drawing on the Right Side of the_
_Brain_, which is a classic and still widely used today. Also, you don’t have
to look far to recognize how marketers have mastered their advertising
strategies to target our right- or left-brain preferences. Even our computer
systems fit the bill: Apple products are viewed as right-brain creative, while
anything Windows based screams left-brain analytical. Remember that
Blackberry? It used to make my right brain moan.



### **HOW THE TWO HEMISPHERES FUNCTION**

In addition to these pop-science efforts that have been designed to
capitalize on the stereotypical differences between our two hemispheres, a
tome of evidence-based science now offers us a pretty clear understanding
of both the anatomical and functional differences between the two halves of
our brain. For anyone interested in both the big picture and the details about
what we have learned concerning these differences over the last half
century, _The Master and His Emissary_, a book by the British psychiatrist
Dr. Iain McGilchrist, is a fascinating and up-to-date read.

In addition, if you are interested in how a Harvard psychiatrist works
with the left- and right-brain characters in an attempt to help his patients
heal issues related to mental illness, the book _Of Two Minds_ by Dr. Fredric
Schiffer is a real eye-opener. It even addresses how our two hemisphere
characters are so different that each may actually manifest unique aches and
pains that the other does not acknowledge or exhibit.

Moreover, if you are looking for an alternative tool in how you might
manage mental health issues, Dr. Richard Schwartz’s Internal Family
Systems model is an interesting strategy that recognizes and works with the
different _parts_ of a person’s personality so they can collaborate to find a
healthy solution. Each of these books and tools is fascinating if you are
interested in learning more about the brain.

Both of our cerebral hemispheres are constantly contributing to the whole
of any experiential moment, so I do not mean to imply that either the left
brain or the right brain functions in isolation. Modern technology shows
clearly that at any moment in time, both hemispheres are contributing to the
input, experience, and output of the nervous system. However, as I stated
previously, brain cells dominate and inhibit their counterpart cells as a
standard practice, so the brain is not _all-on_ or _all-off_ under any
circumstance except for death.

As we think about how the brain works, it is natural to ask this question:
“How is it possible that a group of brain cells can work together to create a
personality at all?” I’m not the first person to ask this question, nor am I the
first to experience a brain trauma, exhibit a change in personality, and then

recover the traumatized cells, regaining old circuits, old skill sets, and lost
personality traits. However, I may be the first neuroanatomist to take this
particular journey deep into the neural and psychological workings of my
brain and then walk away with these unique insights concerning our Four
Characters.

Brain cells are beautiful little creatures that come in many different
shapes and sizes, and their design dictates their ability to perform their
specific function. For example, the sensory neurons located in the primary
auditory cortex of each of our hemispheres have a unique shape that
supports their ability to process sound information. Other neurons that
function to interconnect different regions in the brain have an appropriate
shape for that action, as do the cells of the motor system.

Neuroanatomically, it is important to note that the neurons in your brain
and how they connect with one another are essentially the same for all of
us. Structurally speaking the bumps and grooves of the outermost cerebral
cortex of everyone’s brain are virtually identical, so much so that damage to
a specific area in your brain would wipe out comparably the same function
as in mine, should I have the same trauma. Using the example of the motor
cortex, if you and I experienced damage to the same specific group of cells
in the same hemisphere, we would more than likely experience paralysis in
the same parts of our bodies.

Underlying the functional differences between our two hemispheres are
neurons that process information in unique ways. For example, the neurons
in our left brain function linearly: they take an idea, compare that idea to the
next idea, and then compare the by-product of those ideas to the _next_ idea.
Therefore our left brain has the ability to think sequentially. For example,
we know that we need to start the engine before we put the car in gear. Our
left hemisphere is an amazing serial processor that not only creates abstract
linearity—as in 1+1=2—but manifests for us temporality, the linear sense of
time whereby we can separate past, present, and future.

Our right-brain cells are not at all designed to create linear order. Instead,
our right hemisphere functions like a parallel processor, bringing in multiple
streams of data that simultaneously reveal a single complex moment of
experience. Our right brain manifests a rich composite of the right here,
right now present moment by adding depth to the creation of our memories,
which are influenced by both of our hemispheres.

Although many of our brain cells are responsible for doing obvious
things like understanding language or manifesting vision, other neurons
function to create our thoughts or emotions. We use the term _module_ to
describe the way in which groups of neurons interconnect with one another
in order to function together as an aggregate. Each of our Four Characters,
for example, is supported by its specific and unique module of neurons.

When I experienced the hemorrhage in the left hemisphere of my brain,
most of those cells simply went off-line because of the inflammation,
swelling, and pressure buildup within my skull. In response to the trauma,
the left-brain cells that had dominated my right-brain cells via the corpus
callosum released their inhibition over those cells in my right brain, just as
with the split-brain patients. When this occurred, the characters of my _left_
_thinking_ and _left emotional_ networks receded, while the comparable
characters of my right brain’s _thinking_ and _emotional_ modules became
untethered, unfettered, newly dominant, and free to run wild.

If you are curious about how I could recall the events that happened on
the morning of the stroke, even with my left brain offline, it is important to
note that although the circuits in my left brain shut down due to the trauma,
I did not die, nor did I become unconscious. In addition, the stroke did not
blow up—boom—and then it was all over. Instead, after the blood vessel in
my left hemisphere exploded, over the course of four hours, more and more
blood slowly oozed into that left-brain tissue, shutting circuits off as it went
along. I experienced the stroke as more of a slow pipe leak than an
instantaneous power outage. As a result, my right brain retained the ability
to replay the memory of the morning of the stroke, much like a video.

By the time my left brain finally shut down completely, I had drifted into
the peaceful consciousness of my right brain, where I lost all sense of
urgency. Temporally, my right brain existed solely in the present moment,
with no past regrets, present fears, or future expectations. From this, and the
next eight years of recovery, it was apparent that the job of my right-brain
circuitry was to process the experience of the right here, right now present

moment.

My left hemisphere, on the other hand, had functioned like a _bridge_
_across time_ : it was responsible for linking this present moment to the past
moment and then to the next moment. Somehow those cells in my left brain
were organized in such a way that I had been capable of linear thought.

Miraculously, my left brain understood that I needed to put my socks on
before my shoes.

Clearly, we have two hemispheres for a reason, and without our left brain
we are completely nonfunctional in the external world, in that we have no
past or future, no linear thought, no language, and no sense of the
boundaries of where we begin or end. Our left brain offers us our
individuality, while our right brain connects us with the consciousness of
not only the collective whole of humanity but the vast expansive
consciousness of the universe.

By having both of these hemispheres working together inside of one
head, we experience a natural duality. As a result, it is normal for us to
endure an ongoing internal conflict, based completely on the two uniquely
autonomous perspectives of our left and right brains. For example, my left
brain might want to jump on that homework immediately and get it done,
while my right brain would rather go out and play, leaving the work for the
last minute.



### **THE FOUR CHARACTERS IN OUR BRAIN**

The differences between the two hemispheres are far greater than simply
the underlying anatomy, physiology, and resultant skill sets. My experience
of losing my left brain and then rebuilding it over the course of eight years
taught me that in addition to executing opposite abilities and constructing
different realities, each of my two hemispheres is the home to very specific
and predictable characters. These are the Four Characters you briefly met in
the last chapter.

More specifically, with recovery, when I salvaged the functions of my
left-brain _thinking_ module (Character 1), with them came the goal-driven,
well-organized, methodical, controlling character who had dominated my
pre-stroke life. She was strong, powerful, capable, manipulative, good with
time management, and completely judgmental. Following her recovery, she
wanted to be the boss again inside my brain.

In addition, as this _Left Thinking_ Character 1 regained its ability to
process information linearly, as well as to judge things as right/wrong or
good/bad, I recouped the ability to experience _emotions_ that were dependent
upon a memory from another place and time. For example, we have the
ability to feel guilt or shame in response to something that has already
occurred, or we can build up resentments over time, or seek revenge for
something that has happened in the past. Once the emotional module of my
left brain healed enough to come back online, I could experience these
kinds of emotions again. But just as a strict and productive Character 1
came back online with my left-brain _thinking_ tissue, a pained and cautious
Character 2 came back online with my left-brain _emotional_ cellular
network.

I will admit that I truly enjoyed not having any of the pain from my past
in my left-brain emotional module anymore, as I did not miss those tragic
emotional circuits of my childhood. Yet having said that, life without the
richness of deep emotions is a flat place to exist. This left-brain emotional
Character 2 feels and knows our past pain, and it is this character that takes
us right up to the edge of our potential growth and either pushes us over that
edge or retreats us back into the safety of what feels familiar. I have to

know what is safe and not safe if I am to define the boundaries of my safety.
I have to know what is right for me in order to know what is not right. I
have to know darkness or sadness to recognize light or joy.

It is our left-brain _emotional_ Character 2 who screams, wails, and rages
against all those injustices that it has perceived as hurtful, dangerous, or
unfair. It also holds us back, flees or freezes when something triggers our
fear. Over the years, it has been the job of this tender and vulnerable
character to hold our past pain in memory for our future protection. If we
want to evolve into our best selves and live our best lives, we must create a
healthy relationship with our left-brain Character 2. We grow and thrive
when we are brave enough to stand in the center of our own pain and listen
to what it is trying to communicate.

During my recovery, the newly dominant _Right Thinking_ Character 4,
who felt open, expansive, kind, and as big as the universe, was not too keen
on letting the recovered stress-driven Character 1 of my left thinking brain
waltz right back in to dominate my consciousness. Although I have to say I
was thrilled to have those neural networks back in action, so I could speak
and understand when others spoke to me and know the boundaries of my
body again, I preferred embodying the never-ending peaceful gratitude of
my Character 4’s open heart. That is why I consciously chose to remain
right-brain dominant. And if I can choose which circuitry I want to run, so

can you.

As you move through this book, you will learn a great deal more about
each of your Four Characters, what they feel like inside of your body, and
how you, too, can choose who and how you want to be in any moment.





**CHAPTER 3**
