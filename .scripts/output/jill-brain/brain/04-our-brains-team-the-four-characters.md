# OUR BRAIN’S TEAM : THE FOUR CHARACTERS

The unsung beauty of the split-brain experiments that I described in the
last chapter is that they support with convincing neuroanatomical evidence
the existence of the Four Characters. Surgically separating our two brain
hemispheres has scientifically shown us that they are not simply two
anatomically separate halves of a whole. Instead, the two halves of our
brain house completely different character profiles that each exhibit unique
wants, dreams, interests, and desires. (Just imagine what pearls of wisdom
we might have gleaned if Gazzaniga had chosen to give a Myers-Briggs test
to each of the hemispheres of those commissurotomy patients.)

For some reason that I am unsure of, modern science has backpedaled
away from many of the insights we gained from the split-brain research of
the ’70s, specifically concerning the diverse and often antagonistic
characters residing in each half of our brain. Perhaps this idea faded simply
as collateral damage when scientists rushed in to squelch the exaggerated
public hype. Or perhaps not everyone, including the scientists involved, was
cognizant of their own multiplicity of personality, and as a result those
original seeds of knowledge did not receive the water they required for
future growth.

In the “My Stroke of Insight” TED talk, I purposefully went out on a
limb when I stated, “Our two cerebral hemispheres think about different
things, they care about different things, and, dare I say, they have very
different personalities.” Be it a popular idea or not, I am bringing buckets of
water to revive this very important conversation.

In Part II of this book, we will take a much deeper dive into the skill sets
and personalities of these Four Characters. I will not only help you identify
each of these characters inside of yourself, but we will explore how your
Four Characters can work together to become a healthy team inside of your
brain. In Part III we will observe the Four Characters in action, or as I like
to say, “in the wild.” There, we will first take a look at how the Four
Characters view their relationship with our body and then get a glimpse at
how they each interact predictably in romantic relationships. Because it is
our ultimate goal to create more connection and consequently greater health
within ourselves and with others, we will take a peek at how devastating
addiction can be to our Four Characters, and gain some insight into why it
is that recovery may be effective for one person and not another. From there
we will look at the evolution of the Four Characters over the last 100 years,
and the profound impact that new technologies have had on the different
generations.

As we go along in Part II, for clarity’s sake I will share with you the
name that I have chosen for each of my Four Characters, along with some
of the things I know about her. I do this in an attempt to help you better
relate to and identify that specific character inside of yourself. I believe it is
vital that you take ownership of your own Four Characters, which is why I
have chosen to not give each of these characters a generalized name other
than Character 1, 2, 3, and 4. I think it is really important that you spend a
little time contemplating a name for each of your Four Characters that is
meaningful to you.

With naming your characters, please feel free to be as tame and proper or
as absolutely outrageous as you want to be. Some folks have chosen names
of their parents or friends, while others have selected mythological or
fictional designations. Feel free to use a derivative of your own name or
something completely off the wall. The point here is that you choose a
name that will bring that character full force into the forefront of your mind
when you refer to it.

Anatomically, each of us has a whole brain, and we each have all Four
Characters. You may find, however, that one of your Four Characters may
be dominating, or another part may rarely show up. If it turns out that you
absolutely cannot identify with any of the Four Characters, you might ask
your spouse, or a trusted friend, if they know that part of you. Please note
that although we all exhibit thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that we are

not proud of, none of our Four Characters is bad, wrong, or not worthy of
our love and respect. In addition, it is not unusual that our perspective of
ourselves is different from how others view us. Hopefully, whatever
insights you gain will prove to be an important tool for your own personal
growth.



### **YOUR BRAIN TEAM AND YOUR POWER TO** **CHOOSE**

We have seen how these Four Characters are the natural by-product of
our brain hemispheres’ cells, circuits, and functional modules of thinking
and emotional tissue, but what does this mean for you in your daily life?
Just think about it. Does a day go by when you don’t experience an
intrapersonal conflict? Our two hemispheres value completely different
things, so when your heart says one thing and your head says another, it is
simply a dispute between the different parts of your brain. For example, a
conflict between your right and left _thinking_ characters might look
something like this: “Do I take that job in a new city that pays more and is
an obvious promotion (left-brain thinking values)?” or “Do I keep my
current job so my children can stay in a familiar school and stay connected
to their friends and family (right-brain thinking values)?”

Similarly, a conflict between your right and left _emotional_ characters
might sound like this: “That person hurt me so badly, I just want to get even
and hurt them back (left-brain emotional values)” or “I’ll just send that
person love from afar, and create the time and space away from them that I
need, so my heart can heal and I can move on with grace (right-brain
emotional values).”

In each of these instances, knowing which characters are engaged in the
dialogue, and what their motivating factors are, enables us to make
conscious choices about who and how we want to be.

As you become proficient at identifying your Four Characters and learn
to appreciate and value the skill set that each brings to your life, you will be
able to make this choice more consciously and deliberately. However, just
knowing your Four Characters is not enough. The ultimate goal is for your
Four Characters to become so familiar with one another that they create
healthy relationships among themselves. Once this happens, your Four
Characters will collectively function as a healthy team that is armed with all
of your genius and natural abilities.

Teammates in any situation—like a sports team on the field or a team of
colleagues at work—will call a quick “huddle” to assess a situation and
strategize their next moves. Your brain team, made up of your Four
Characters, can huddle together at any moment to analyze what is going on
in your life and then collectively decide who and how you want to be in the
next circumstance.

Following up on that, in Part II not only will we explore the Four
Characters in detail, but I will share with you a five-step process that I call
the Brain Huddle, whereby we consciously take a pause, call all Four
Characters into our awareness, and then together as a team contemplate our
next best move. I will encourage you to practice the Brain Huddle in
everyday moments so you can train your brain to make important decisions
swiftly and skillfully. If you are willing to train your Four Characters to
function as a team during the benign moments of your life, when you are in
duress you will have that skill available.

For now, here is a quick preview of the steps we will take to do a Brain
Huddle:

_**Breathe**_ and focus on your breath. This enables you to hit the pause
button, interrupt your emotional reactivity, and bring your mind to the
present moment with a focus on yourself.

_**Recognize**_ which of the Four Characters’ circuitry you are running
in the present moment.

_**Appreciate**_ whichever character you find yourself exhibiting, and
appreciate the fact that you have all Four Characters available to you at
any moment.

_**Inquire**_ within and invite all Four Characters into the huddle so they
can collectively and consciously strategize your next move.

_**Navigate**_ your new reality, with all Four Characters bringing their
best game.

You will no doubt realize that these five steps of the Brain Huddle spell
out “B-R-A-I-N.” While I, of course, think this acronym is adorable, it also
has a real purpose: to help you quickly remember the steps when the

pressure is on and your Character 2’s stress circuitry is running on
overdrive. In moments like those, when you can barely think because the
chemicals of anxiety or fear are flooding through your bloodstream and
overwhelming your circuitry, this B-R-A-I-N acronym can beam like a
bright neon light, reminding you of the steps you can take to call your brain
team together so you can find your way back into the peace of your right
brain.

This process of the Brain Huddle whereby we can consciously and
deliberately bring all Four Characters into the conversation is both powerful
and empowering. We have the ability to interrupt the automatic circuitry of
our emotional reactivity and consciously choose which of the Four
Characters we want to have as dominant in any moment. Knowing our Four
Characters and being able to recognize them in others enables us to interact
more authentically in a whole-brain way. We have the power to purposely
build healthy and healing relationships with others.



### **YOUR HERO’S JOURNEY TO PEACE**

As I noted in Chapter 1, this journey you are embarking on as you get to
know your Four Characters and learn how to integrate them into your brain
team is a mirror of the Hero’s Journey in Joseph Campbell’s classic
monomyth. In addition, it is worth noting that the Four Characters coincide
distinctly with Carl Jung’s four major archetypes of the unconscious mind:
Character 1—the Persona; Character 2—the Shadow; Character 3—the
Animus/Anima; and Character 4—the True Self.

In the classic story of the Hero’s Journey, the hero heeds the call to leave
behind his rational, ego-based consciousness that processes the reality of
the external world. In the language of the Four Characters, the hero must
step out of the ego-based consciousness of his Character 1 left thinking
brain to enter into the unconscious realm of his right brain. To embark upon
this quest, the hero must be willing to let go of his possessions and worldly
knowledge and embrace the death of his ego’s individuality. To paraphrase
Einstein, we must be willing to give up what we are, in order to become
what we will be.

As you might imagine, this is an enormous task for the hero to undertake,
which is why, of course, he is described as heroic. He must be willing to set
aside everything he has acquired and grown up to be. (Much like the
journey of the Buddha, who famously set aside his position and worldly
possessions in order to grasp the true nature of reality and attain
enlightenment.) But once the hero chooses to shed the rational, ego-based
individuality of his left brain, he enters into the realm of his unconscious
right brain, where he will meet the Anima/Animus, the androgynous nature
of his soul. The hero cannot be both characters—his individual and
collective selves—in the same moment. He must lay down the justicedemanding judgment of his dominating left brain (Characters 1 and 2) if he
is to embody the merciful characters of his compassionate right brain
(Characters 3 and 4).

When we are born, we have no sense of individuality, and our two brain
hemispheres are similar in both their structure and in what they value. Over
time, however, our left-brain cells develop the ability to define the physical

boundaries of where we begin and end, and with that identification of self,
we gain the ability to perceive ourselves as individuals who are separate
from the whole. It is in those moments that the droplet of our left brain’s
individual consciousness becomes separate from that sea of cosmic
consciousness from which it came. Before the hero’s left-brain ego-cells
developed his perception of himself as an individual, he possessed the
collective knowledge of his right brain’s unconscious mind. With time, as
the individuation of his left brain developed, it grew to dominate and inhibit
the knowledge of his right-brain mind. Consequently, the cosmic
consciousness of his right brain shifted into the background, becoming his
unconscious intuition.

It is said that in that moment when the hero lays down the sword of his
left-brain righteousness and ego, he is emancipated from his left-brain
individuality, dissolving back into the cosmic consciousness of the universe
from which he originated. Like the droplet returning to the sea, the hero is
instantly enveloped by the blissful euphoria of the eternal love that his soul
once knew before he was born. Like the great whale that he had forgotten
he was, his soul returns to gliding through the sea of silent euphoria at One
with all that is.

Once the hero has battled his fear of death and all the other left-brain
monsters he had been clinging to throughout his everyday life, he is now
free to gain the insights of his heroic quest while enveloped in the wisdom
of his euphoric right brain. At this point, however, the hero must choose to
either return home and share his hard-won whole-brain knowledge or keep
for himself the lessons he has gleaned. Returning home, he is different now,
and it is his challenge to figure out how to live a balanced life in the
external world while remaining aware of both his conscious and
unconscious characters and their conflicting values.

The Four Characters, as I outline them in this book, provide a
neuroanatomical road map of the time-tested paradigm of Jung’s Four
Archetypes. Like a house with four rooms, two upstairs and two downstairs,
our brain is the home of all of these Four Characters. With minimal effort,
we can train ourselves to identify each of them within our own psyche,
purposefully create healthy relationships between them, and then let them
collectively, as our brain team, lead our lives in peace.

If you are willing to pause and recognize what is already going on inside
of your brain, if you are game to observe how you present yourself under

different circumstances, and if you are prepared to bring your presentmoment awareness to your current thinking and emotional patterns, you
will be well on your way to living a life of choice. I invite you to embark
upon your own Hero’s Journey as you explore the Four Characters inside
your conscious and unconscious whole-brain hemispheres.

Peace really is just a thought away.
