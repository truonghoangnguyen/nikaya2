# DISCONNECTION AND RECONNECTION —OUR FOUR CHARACTERS IN ADDICTION AND RECOVERY

As I discussed in the earliest chapters, at the level of the single-celled
organism, the meaning of life appears to be the ability to stimulate and be
stimulated by that which is outside of oneself. The semipermeable
membrane of the single cell allows some things to enter into the organism
while blocking other things from entry. In addition, that membrane is
stippled with specific types of receptors that will attract the cell toward
some things in the external world or repel the cell and push it off onto a
different trajectory, like two repelling magnets.

When the consciousness of the universe conceived single-celled
microbes, it not only attained a higher level of order in the form of life, but
it also manufactured a way in which it could keep itself stimulated and
probably entertained. Via the semipermeable membrane, the universe
manifested a way in which a portion of itself could be pinched off from the
rest, establishing an original duality of consciousness through the
establishment of a this and a that (a life-form and a universe). With the
creation of the microbe, a conversation between the consciousness within
the cell and the consciousness of the universe embarked full force.

This conversation is comparable to what is going on inside each of our
brains, except we are multicellular creatures rather than single-celled
microbes. As a result, our neurons exist in three levels of environment
rather than just the inner world of the microbe and the outer world of the
universe. Neurons have an internal world that is separate from and
functionally in relationship with the immediate extracellular space that
surrounds it. The extracellular matrix is the space that is located between
the different neurons within our brain, and neuronal intercommunication is

completely dependent on the molecules (and the electrical charges of those
molecules) for their communication to be successful.

In the human, a brain’s intelligence is dependent on the number of
connections between the neurons that make up that brain. Functionally,
intelligence is not simply a product of the size of a brain or the number of
neurons in a brain. In order for intelligence to occur, the neurons must share
their information with one another via connections.

A brain that has a lot of connections between its neurons is like a person
with a computer who has access to all of the information on the Internet,
compared to a person who is working with a computer that is not online.
The person with the Internet connection has access to a massive volume of
information, and the person without an Internet connection only has access
to whatever is stored on their hard drive. Similarly, the more connections
we have between our neurons, the more those neurons communicate with
one another, adding their information to the overall knowledge base. In
addition, as we increase the connections between the neurons in our brain,
we develop higher levels of differentiation and refinement in the quality of
our ability to think and feel.



### **CELL TRAUMA AND CONSCIOUS LIVING**

When I was cut off from the thinking and emotional cells of my left
hemisphere on the morning of the stroke, I was no longer privy to the
information those cells held. Subsequently I lost language and any ability to
comprehend that there were people who were separate from me. I lost all
ability to communicate with anyone because I did not know that they
existed at all.

In and of itself, losing my left-brain consciousness was unquestionably
an amazing experience, but if I am to be alive and function as a normal and
healthy human being in relationship with other people, my neurons are
clearly a precious commodity. I have learned that my worldview is 100
percent dependent on the health and well-being of my brain cells and their
connections with one another. I worked so hard for eight years to replenish
those neural connections that I not only recognize their value but now do
everything I can to protect them.

Yet not all of us take equal care to protect our brains’ connections.
Because we live in a world that values what we have in the form of external
wealth and celebrity (Characters 1 and 2) over who we are as a precious
form of life (Characters 3 and 4), many of us are not finding meaning in our
lives and are choosing to escape through the use of alcohol and drugs.

In choosing the topic for this chapter, I certainly recognize that it would
be much more fun for us to explore how the Four Characters select a
Netflix series or pick a vacation. But at this juncture we need to investigate
this subject, because there is nothing more destructive to our brains than
addiction to drugs and alcohol. Addiction is a disease that disregards any
socioeconomic or educational boundaries. It is a universal problem that
does not discriminate between the homeless man and the millionaire in the

mansion.

The neurological abuse that so many of us are actively engaging in
through the use of alcohol and drugs is not only self-destructive but gets in
the way of us having healthy relationships with other people. And it places
an enormous strain on the health and well-being of humanity as a whole. A
healthy society is made up of a collection of healthy brains, and a healthy

brain is made up of healthy cells that are in communication with one
another. We have the ability to choose whether we want to live our lives
running on automatic or live our lives more consciously. We can either
bounce around unconsciously like microbes in the wind with no direction,
or we can choose to evolve our brains toward whole-brain living. Calling
our Four Characters into the Brain Huddle offers us a tool that we can use
to do this and to purposely live more consciously directed, balanced, and
meaningful lives.

How we want to live is a personal decision, and I realize that many of us
have chosen to use drugs and alcohol out of a desire to simply disconnect
from reality, for whatever reason. Unfortunately our brains are naturally
inclined to become addicted, and the more we disconnect from reality, the
more our brain cells disconnect from one another and the more rigid we
become in our thinking and feeling. When we are running our addiction
circuitry, we are running on automatic in such a way that our circuitry is
running us. This is exactly the opposite of living consciously and choosing
who and how you want to be. If an addiction is running your brain, rest
assured that you can find support, and there are effective tools that you can
use to regain your power, break those cellular patterns, and live the life you
want to live.

The best news of all is that neuroplasticity is real, and we do have the
power to heal our brains and have a successful recovery if we are willing to
consistently do the work. Millions of people all around the world are using
the Alcoholics Anonymous Twelve Step Program as they attempt to attain
and hold on to their sobriety. In the following pages we are going to look
more closely at various tools as they relate to the brain, including the
Twelve Steps, the Brain Huddle of the Four Characters, the Hero’s Journey,
and the story of the Buddha’s journey to enlightenment. Although each of
these tools and narratives uses different language, they all describe a similar
shift in awareness and consciousness at the level of the brain.

Here we will explore the issues of addiction and recovery as they relate
to the Four Characters in the hope that we might gain some insight into how
we can effectively help ourselves and our loved ones who are in need.



### **WHEN ADDICTION TOUCHED MY LIFE**

Many years ago I found myself in a romantic relationship with an addict
who was abusing both drugs and alcohol. In my naivety I forced my love to
choose between having a healthy relationship with me and continuing to
abuse. To my horror and surprise, I lost that gamble, and I found myself at
an Al-Anon meeting wondering what the heck had just happened to my life.
In that meeting I learned that although my primary relationship had been
with a person, my partner’s primary relationship was with alcohol.
Although this was a devastating realization for me, this clarity gave me the
courage to practice self-love, let go of the relationship, and choose my own
mental health.

Up to that point in time, I had spent my academic career studying the
brain with a focus on schizophrenia at both the neuroanatomical and
psychiatric levels. My own painstaking experience with rebuilding my brain
following that severe stroke left me in awe of how vulnerable and fragile
both life and this beautiful organ really are. Having worked so hard to
recover my own brain, it seemed completely unconscionable to me that
anyone would choose to disrespect and abuse their brain cells on purpose.

As a curious scientist, once addiction had touched my life directly, I
naturally began to explore the power of addiction at the level of the brain.
Not only did I want to better understand what was going on at a cellular
level in the brain circuitry of those who abuse drugs and alcohol, but
equally important, I wanted to comprehend what was going on in the hearts
and minds of those of us who love these people as our friends and family.
Inevitably this line of questioning has led me into the centuries-old theme
of _suffering_, and why is it that we human beings will stay in emotional
relationships that are clearly not life giving? Also of equal importance, how
might we support people who are not interested in helping themselves?

Prior to my stroke and during my 20s, I was addicted to menthol tobacco.
For this reason I am intimately familiar with the stories we tell ourselves
and others about why we are engaging in these destructive behaviors, e.g.,
the menthol opens my nasal passages so I can breathe more deeply. My
favorite excuse for smoking was that cigarettes slowed my brain down

enough so I could type as quickly as I could think. I _used_ tobacco to help
me write my dissertation. That may actually have been true, but it was still

a poor excuse.

During the decade that I was a smoker, I felt incredible shame. After all, I
was a medical professional in training who knew not only how hazardous
smoking was for my health but how disrespectful it was to my cells.
Regardless, my deep shame was not powerful enough for me to quit. I tried
to stop several times, but the craving was stronger than my discipline, so I
would start up again. I hated that I would binge on another pack and then
have to start that counter all over again due to my relapse. I felt deep pain
that here I was, a strong academic with a powerful mind, being controlled
by something that was four inches long. The worst part was that once I
indulged, I would crash even deeper into despair than when I was just
craving. I was miserable about how deeply seated the addiction was in my
brain, and I abhorred its power.

I did eventually stop cold turkey when my mother, in all of her infinite
wisdom, offered me—a starving graduate student—$10 a day for every day
I did not smoke, for the rest of my life. My Character 1 jumped right on that
bribe, my Character 2 went into therapy about the addiction, and after
celebrating three months I was so elated to be a nonsmoker that I let my
mom off the hook. I am so grateful to this day for that bribe, yet even now,
over 30 years later, that addiction is so engrained in my brain that I
occasionally find myself smoking in my dreams.

I want to emphasize that I understand completely that addiction at the
level of our brain is a powerful and devastating condition. I am absolutely
in no way minimizing the experience or the profound nature of these
disorders, and I respect that many of those who remain caught in the throes
of any form of addiction desperately want relief and often live their lives in
the ongoing fear that one day, they will use again.



### **A COMMON STORY**

Addiction is viewed as a family disease, and when the Four Characters
conversation is used within a family that is willing to stop their judgment
and lay down their swords, people may better understand what is actually
going on in the thought processes of the other. Al-Anon, which I mentioned
above, is a special program for the friends and family of alcoholics, and it
uses Al-Anon language. Alcoholics Anonymous is a program for users and
its language is specific to it. By contrast, the Four Characters can offer a
common language for both the user and their loved ones, offering clarity
and understanding to what is actually going on in the thinking processes of
both parties.

Let’s listen in on an example of an internal conversation that may be
going on inside the brain of an alcoholic who is intoxicated and the brain of
a loved one, framed in the language of the Four Characters.

Let’s say I am an alcoholic and when I am drinking, my brain is
singularly focused on what it feels like to be intoxicated. When I am flying
high as a kite, I am not aware that I have Four Characters because the voice
of the alcohol has completely hijacked my brain, and I’m not capable of
rational thought. I feel numb because my brain cells are pickled, and I am
no longer capable of feeling any real emotions. By simply using my drug, I
have created an enormous disconnect from my life, my pain, my Four
Characters, and those who are trying to have a relationship with me.

Because of my alcohol consumption, as one would predict, the Character
1 details of my life fall through cracks. In my stupor I miss scheduled
events, and my friends and family are upset because they feel, yet again,
neglected and disrespected because I am not showing up as my best and
sober self. With my normal range of emotions now limited, which is
probably why I drank in the first place, I am emotionally removed and
unavailable. My brain cells are high, and by overindulging in the alcohol, I
am giving them the message that I don’t value them and I don’t care if they
function at all. Because my brain cells are traumatized, they disconnect
some of their connections with other neurons, and my thinking and

emotional abilities become more rigid and closed-minded because I have
fewer cells to work with.

Imagine, then, that my friends and family come to me and gently explain
that we had a plan to get together, but because I was drinking, I was neither
physically nor emotionally available. As an addict my own Character 1 now
comes online, and in its harsh and critical judgment, I begin interrogating
myself about how I could have possibly done that, once again letting down
not only the people I love but myself. Inside the throes of my own
indefensible behavior, my Character 1 is displeased because I let alcohol
take control of me, so I did not execute the plan that it (my Character 1) had
laid out for me. Instead I irresponsibly relinquished my willpower,
neglected my personal hygiene, and denigrated the people I most care
about. I used alcohol to turn off the voice of my Characters 1 and 2, and by
doing so I completely abandoned everyone, including myself.

At this point in my internal dialogue, Character 2 pops in with a feeling
of intense remorse, and I unforgivingly judge myself to be a total failure.
Yet at the same time, my Character 2 delineates that I am different from
those normal nonaddicts and they do not understand me at all.
Consequently, I feel remorse and isolated because I am _terminally unique_
and not like them. They don’t understand that they can go and party and it is
easy for them, but I can’t do that, so I feel like I am alone in my pain.

Subsequently I not only let myself down but I let my friends and family
down too. I feel shame because this is not my first rodeo, and I am well
versed in how to berate myself. I fall into deep despair and wallow in
hopelessness. I condemn myself for my own pathetic weakness against the
drug. I feel embarrassed, and I might even hate myself for the high. Yet
inside my pulsating head, my Character 2 feels like a pressure cooker that is
ready to explode with vehement hostility and blame. Of course my
addiction is all your fault!

But then I sober up and get some sleep, and if I’m healthy enough, my
Character 3 comes back online and I feel fresh and happy again. All I want
to do is play with you now, so we can make up and make it all feel better.
My Character 3 is eager to heal with you. It wants to just forget about what
happened, do a rerun with you, and this time I’ll show up as my fun-loving,
charming, innocent, and attractive Character 3 self that you love so much.
And because your Character 1 wants desperately to forgive me and trust me
again, you go along with the plan.

And in my mind, my Character 4 says today is another perfect day, and
what will be will be. Today is a new beginning and today I will not drink.
So you and I make up, and we make a new plan to go get pizza tonight.
Simple as that, and all is well. Your Character 1 is a bit wary, but it trusts
that you can relax now, so you head off to work. My Character 3 goes to
exercise, then my Character 1 goes to work, and everything is right in the
world, at least until I drink again.

As for you, my friend or family member, your Character 3 is all excited
because we are going to play and eat and connect with one another like we
used to. But then your Character 2 starts to fear that I am going to drink
again, so you start calling me every hour to confirm that I am at work and
doing okay. Which really means you are checking to see if I am sober. Then
your Character 1 runs home at lunch to get rid of all the booze in your
house so there is no temptation for me should I stop by there after the pizza.

But in a moment of craving desire, and remorse and shame for my past
behavior, my Character 2 goes over to the pizza place early, and I bingedrink a pitcher of beer before you get there. Your Character 3 comes
bouncing in all excited to see me, so my Character 2 lies, and I tell you that
I only had one beer. Because your Character 1 wants desperately to believe
me, you don’t make a big deal out of it, and your Character 3 is happy.

We are all so pleased that everything is good again. At least until the
server comes over to take our pizza order and asks if we would like another
pitcher of beer. Then your Character 1 goes ballistic, lashes out with harsh
negative judgment, and your Character 2 reprimands me for not having any
self-respect or ability to control my drinking. Then in a flash, your
Character 2 takes my behavior personally and you start to cry, and then you
get up and walk out. Feeling that you have abandoned me, my Character 2
looks to find peace in yet another pitcher of beer. Not at all aware that this
happened because I had abandoned myself first in the moment I chose to
disconnect and use again.

In your fury and pain, your Character 1 then rationalizes that if you had
just called me a little more often, or controlled my money, or my time, or
my friends, or, or, maybe this would not have happened. Then your
Character 2 comes online and you reproach yourself for my drinking
because you didn’t fix me or control me tightly enough. In your own mind,
your Character 2 thrashes out that you knew you could not trust me, and
then you criticize yourself for trusting me at all. At this point your little

Character 2 feels abandoned, judges me negatively, and may even attack me
with verbal threats or a bitter tongue. Your Character 2, reeling in her own
pain, feels ashamed and powerless and takes on the blame. Knowing full
well that your greatest fear is that I am going to die from this disease.



### **A COMMENT**

This kind of dynamic happens regularly between an alcoholic and their
friends and family. The alcoholic’s Character 2 says, “I’m scared of you,
my friends and family, because if you find out that I am using again, you
will judge and criticize me, but mostly, you will stop loving me.” Then their
Character 1 decides that they need be deceptive and hide the fact that they
are drinking. So they lie, cleverly, and at their worst they gaslight us into
believing that our perceptions are wrong.

The alcoholic’s Character 2 will sabotage their emotional connections in
an effort to keep their cover, while their friends’ and family’s Character 1s
try to address the problem by attending Al-Anon meetings and going to
therapy. “ _Fix me? Help me? What on earth makes you think that you have_
_that power?_ ” professes the alcoholic.

Based on what we now know about the brain, as well as the Four
Characters, it is safe to assume that the portion of our brain that is truly
emotionally addicted and stays addicted to drugs or alcohol are the cells of
our left and right emotional centers. What this means is that if a
rehabilitation program is going to succeed, both our Characters 2 and 3
must be on board and committed to doing the emotional work. If they are
not willing to participate, the rehabilitation will not deliver a lasting impact.

When an addict/alcoholic strategizes any rehabilitation effort only
through the filter of their Character 1, they will jump through the
appropriate hoops, clean out their blood, walk the walk, and talk the talk. To
a Character 1, this is a successful recovery, even though they have
completely neglected to shift their emotional relationship with their
substance of choice. Remembering that we are feeling creatures who think,
rather than thinking creatures who feel, although our Character 1 may help
us shift our beliefs and our behavior, this is not enough for us to achieve a
genuine rehabilitation. Unless the Character 1 hits rock bottom and
becomes emotionally compromised as their Character 2, relapse is likely.

Alcoholism and addiction are moment-by-moment crises, and although
the theme of Twelve Step Programs is _one day at a time_, the biological
hook of addiction rests not only in the power of choice in the present

moment (Character 3) but in the pain, guilt, and shame of our past
(Character 2). To complicate matters, addiction has actually rewired our
brain and possibly caused damage at the cellular level, disconnecting us
from many of the things that make our life worth living. Consequently,
although our Character 3 absolutely needs to participate in our recovery
because we require its effort to help us make good choices in the present
moment, at the core of our brain’s ability to crave, it is our Character 2 who
holds the key to a successful rehabilitation. Our Character 2 must be willing
to participate in doing the work if recovery is going to last.

When we look more specifically at addiction and rehabilitation, if our
Character 1 or 3 jumps through the hoops of our program, we may look
clean on the outside. But if our Character 2 is not on board and actively
participating in the process, we will relapse. Our Character 1 may come on
board because they have a lot to lose, and our Character 3 might show up
because it wants to be connected and does not want to feel isolated. But

until our Character 2 surrenders its resentments, blame, and shame to our
Character 4, there will be no spiritual awakening or true transformation.

Worthy of note, it is possible for an addict who is in rehabilitation to
mimic the Character 4 of another person who appears to be finding peace
and gaining success inside the program. However, although it is necessary
for our Character 4 to come online and lift us above the illness, our
Characters 2 and 3 must be intimately engaged in the process or relapse will
inevitably occur. We are feeling creatures who think, and there is no way
for us to finesse around that fact when it comes to changing any core
behavior.



### **MORE ON FRIENDS AND FAMILY**

When I first started exploring the impact of an addict’s behavior on the
health and well-being of their friends and family based on my own familial
experience with schizophrenia, I have to say that the resemblance was
uncanny. How can we adequately support someone who uses or is ill and
yet minimize the negative impact of that compromised brain on how we
live our own lives and nurture our own mental health?

People who are in relationship with one another tend to balance each
other out. For example, if one person enjoys spending a lot of money, their
partner often counterbalances that spending by being more fiscally
conservative. The same is true when it comes to responsibility. If an addict
is behaving in irresponsible ways, it is natural for their friends and family to
shift into their responsible Character 1s to balance the dance. It is important
to note that counterbalancing someone who is polarized to an extreme is no
fun, and the effort feels like a burden for the Character 1. When a Soft
Character 1 is cornered in a counterbalance effort, they may well shift into
their Hard Character 1, adding stress to the relationship.

I certainly lived with this up close and personal in my own family.
Having a brother diagnosed with schizophrenia motivated me and G. G. to
team up as our Character 1s. Together we assisted my brother with his
medical issues, provided a roof over his head, and kept his insanity in check
just enough so that he could stay out of jail. Sometimes we succeeded and
sometimes we did not. Our Character 1s managed his illness the best we
could, ever complicated by having to battle against confidentiality issues
with a system that was not sensitive to the positive intentions of our family.
Since my brother was not able to manage his own illness, the responsibility
fell to us, and in many ways the conversation listed above between the
alcoholic and his family and friends was exactly the same for our family
with schizophrenia.

In the case of alcoholism, the Character 1s of the friends and family
desperately want to stay engaged with the person they used to know, so they
persist in their efforts to help their loved one show up sober. If a Character 1
gives up on their loved one, they have to face the possibility that whatever

they shared with that person was not real nor had any true meaning. This
can be devastating to a Character 1 who thought they were having an
intimate relationship with a person while that person was actually having
their primary relationship with their drug of choice.

Once the addict/alcoholic repeatedly shows up for dates and events under
the influence, friends and family turn up their Hard Character 1s and start
creating strict rules. They set a household program, manage tons of details,
create a perfect world, and demand that the addict attend rehab (or take
their meds). Character 1s will protect the image of the happy family, make
up a story to compensate for bad behavior, and perhaps even protect
themselves by becoming a workaholic. Hard Character 1s often choose to
travel or work more, simply because dealing with their project out in the
world is easier than fixing the addict they have at home.

Friends and family live in extreme stress because they never know when
the alcoholic will _use_
again. A Soft Character 1, when placed under the
stress of living with an addict, may well change into a Hard 1 because the
Hard Character 1 is driven by their fear-based Character 2. Character 1s
hide the pain and suffering of their Character 2s in the form of selfabandonment. Friends and family become desperate to keep as much sanity
in their lives as they possibly can, so they often give away their power just
to keep the peace. Burying their heads in the sand like this, of course, puts
the addict in control of the relationship, which bodes a predictable disaster.
Yet as long as the addict is working the Twelve Step Program and trying to
stay straight, the hope for the friends and family Character 1 is that the
relationship will one day miraculously and spontaneously return to the way
it was in the beginning.

The friends and family Character 1s know very well that negotiating with
an addict is a total waste of time, but rather than admitting to failure and
giving up hope, they desperately hold on to the dream. To protect
themselves, the friends’ and family’s Character 2s will go to their Character
1s and say, “You need to get a better handle on this. We need more rules,
more therapy, more frequent rehab. We also need to make more money so
we can eliminate the addict’s stress.” And just like that, in a flash they
completely enable their addict to stay at home, unemployed.

The Hard Character 1 goes along with these crazy schemes because for
some families, these strategies seem to work, and it is also how they
manage to keep themselves sane. To the Hard Character 1, life is like an

Excel spreadsheet, and if they work just a bit harder and smarter, they will
find a solution. But sadly, home has become a battleground where no one
feels safe. Eventually the Hard Character 1 will wake up completely
exhausted, realizing that they have inadvertently abandoned themselves by
not listening to the intuition of their own Character 4.

Not wanting to give up on someone they love, or dismiss their dreams as
not valid, Characters 1 and 2 hold on desperately to their hope. But after
enough pain, Character 1s will throw in the towel when their Character 2s
become so overwhelmed, anxious, or depressed that they feel completely
powerless and defeated. For the Character 1, the tighter they hold on to the
reins of their hopefulness, the more permission they give to the addict to up
the ante and escalate the drama to the next level.



### **STORIES AND STRATEGIES TO HELP** **OURSELVES**

There are a lot of programs that are specifically designed to help us get
out of our pain and restore our cognitive connections, both within ourselves
and with others. Different programs, of course, have unique appeal
depending on what we believe in. There are community programs directed
at helping us recover our cognitive stability, deep inner peace, or
specifically our sobriety. Be it recovery from our life’s challenges or
recovery from substance abuse, finding our way beyond the wound and into
a higher level of consciousness requires awareness, willingness, and a
heartfelt commitment that is supported by an open mind.

If you believe in the doctrines of religion, then you will be attracted to
programs that specifically resonate with your religious beliefs. Similarly, if
you describe yourself as _spiritual but not religious_, programs that use
spiritual language might appeal to you. The same is true if you are agnostic
or atheist. You may find the language of science and the brain more suitable
and therefore more effective in how you choose to live your best life.

Regardless of your beliefs and practices, different programs or ideologies
teach pretty much the same message. When it comes to helping ourselves
recover from anything, the fundamental message and steps underlying the
wisdom of the Hero’s Journey, for example, will naturally appeal to our
Characters 1 and 2, because our left-brain characters enjoy a challenge, a
quest, and a competition. The story of the Buddha (remembering that
Buddhism is a practice and not a religion) uses language that appeals to our
Characters 3 and 4, as our right brain is the realm of our enlightenment and
redemption. Recovery as it is framed in the Twelve Step Program speaks
directly to our Characters 1 and 2, as it commands an acceptance that we
are powerless over our drug and we must at least be open to the idea that
there is a Higher Power (a Character 4).

Although these different ideologies are unique in how they address our
Four Characters, the overall intention and outcome are the same. Each of
these narratives is designed to help us obtain a significant realization that

will lead us to a fundamental change. Each of these narratives will lead us
out of our left-brain Characters 1 and 2 and into the peaceful realm of our
right-brain Character 4. The _peace is just a thought away_ concept of the
Brain Huddle can appeal to and empower each of our Four Characters
simultaneously, leading them all to invest their energy and collaborate
successfully.

We all have problems and we all suffer emotionally. In the case of the
Buddha, he awakened to the understanding that the cause of our suffering is
our emotional attachments. Thus when we lose things, people, titles, and
freedoms that we want to hold on to, we experience emotional pain. In the
case of the Hero’s Journey, we hear and heed a calling to embark on a great
adventure, eventually stepping out of our ignorance and into our wisdom.
While in the case of the Brain Huddle, our Four Characters come together
in agreement to bring our best and most authentic self forward. Finally, the
Twelve Steps ground our efforts toward sobriety and recovery, literally step
by step. Regardless of which of these paths we are naturally inclined to
follow, or which story or strategy resonates with us best, a committed effort
by all four of our characters should result in some form of resurrection, and
freedom from that which roots us in our pain.

When it comes to suffering, we have cells that perform that function. We
either succumb to it, linger in it, or try to move beyond it. Some of us will
use an addiction in an attempt to escape suffering, but sadly, that only
masks the real problem that eventually will need to be addressed. These
tools, and many others that are not listed here, are quite specific in their
storyline but when practiced faithfully should lead to a common outcome.
Peace really is just a thought away, and the key to your brain’s health will
rest in your ability to find the story that speaks to you, followed by your
commitment to that technique.

Regardless of the details, the steps we take to find peace remain
consistent. First, we must recognize that there is a problem or a change that
we want to make happen, which must be followed by a willingness to work
for that change. Right out of the gate, we must be willing to step out of our
left-brain ego and shift into the higher consciousness or unconsciousness of
our right brain. Embarking on this part of the journey is often the most
difficult step, as it requires us to recognize and admit that our small-self
ego-brain must step to the side if we are to grow beyond what we currently

are.

Setting down our ego, regardless of the program, can feel like death, and
our left brain will fight to maintain its own existence. It does not want to
hand its control over to the unknown because doing so feels scary. In the
case of the Hero’s Journey, these are the monsters that it must battle. For the
AA Twelve Step Program, steps 1 and 2 require that we admit that we are
powerless over our addiction and that we need help from our Higher Power.
To obtain enlightenment the Buddha had to step away from of all of his
worldly possessions, including his knowledge, money, titles, and even the
people he loved. In the language of the Four Characters, we must be willing
to step out of our left-brain Characters 1 and 2 and step into the presentmoment consciousness of our right here, right now, right-brain Characters 3
and 4.

Each of these narratives requires a leap of faith. We must be willing to
step beyond what we have held as true and recognize that there is
something greater than us that will both hold us and guide us safely into the
unknown. This can be a very tall order, so it might be helpful to know that
even when we do choose to set our ego aside, it is always right there, eager
and ready to jump right back online at a moment’s notice.



### **THE JOURNEY OF RECOVERY**

Throughout this book we have touched on the storyline of the Hero’s
Journey. When we come to explore it more deeply, it becomes obvious that
these stages are closely parallel to the AA and NA (Narcotics Anonymous)
Twelve Step Programs. These are spiritually based programs that are
successfully worked by millions of alcoholics and drug addicts throughout
the world. They are organized in such a way that they provide a detailed,
step-by-step road map to a successful and ongoing recovery.

The similarity starts with the very first steps. In the language of the Four
Characters, in order for a Twelve Step Program to be an effective tool for
recovery, the alcoholic/addict must be willing to step out of their left-brain
Characters 1 and 2 and step into the consciousness of their right-brain
Character 4, or at least believe that it is out there and available.

Even the final steps of these different ideologies look the same. In the
case of the hero, to complete his journey he must return to his old life,
completely conscious and willing to share the wisdom of his redemption
with others. For the alcoholic the resurrection is a _planned and spontaneous_
_remission_ of the illness that he must continue to nurture and maintain
through his relationship with his Higher Power, and he must return to his
life and .
_carry his message to others_

No matter which program we choose to use, once we have established a
healthy relationship with our Character 4 Higher Power/God/Infinite Being,
we exist in a deep connection to all that is precious in this life. This
relationship with our Higher Power innately emboldens and empowers us to
continue working the program of our choice, and we will sustain our
sobriety and/or our deep inner peace.

A healthy brain is a brain that is made up of healthy cells that are in
connection with one another. Let us take a closer look at the details of the
Twelve Step Program of Alcoholics Anonymous, as written in the format of
the originating members of the Society, alongside the steps in the Hero’s
Journey and the experience of the Four Characters in quest of a healthy
brain. It is my hope that as you explore these steps and stories, you will
realize your own journey.

**AA Step 1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol—that our lives**
**had become unmanageable.**

_Four Characters:_

My Character 1 is a great taskmaster, and its area of expertise is taking
care of the details of my life. At this point my Character 1 admits that I am
powerless over this addiction, and that my life has deteriorated to a level
that is not sustainable or manageable.

_Hero’s Journey:_

In the Hero’s Journey, I recognize that a change needs to occur and there
is a quest to be had. I hear the dragon calling.

**AA Step 2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could**
**restore us to sanity.**

_Four Characters:_

By this point my Character 1 has admitted and acknowledged that my
problem is too big for me to fix by myself. When my Character 1 looks
around at others who have had this same problem, it is clear that those who
are actively working the Twelve Step Program have discovered a way to
control their addiction and feel better. My Character 1 realizes that those
who are engaged in a successful rehabilitation have established a _spiritual_
relationship with something that is greater than themselves, and that within
that relationship with their Character 4, there has been a psychic shift
leading to a profound redemption. I don’t completely understand this at this
point, but I know I want it.

_Hero’s Journey:_

I realize there is a quest waiting for me, and I decide that I am willing to
embark on that journey because I am ready for a change. At this point I
begin battling my monsters that don’t want me to change, including the grip
of my ego-self. I choose to gather up my courage and face my fears,
heeding the call of the journey.

**AA Step 3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the**
**care of God as we understood Him.**

_Four Characters:_

My left-brain Characters 1 and 2 have been living a pretty self-centered,
egocentric life.

When I look at my life closely and I am totally honest with myself, my
left-brain Characters 1 and 2 are aware that if I really do want to be sober, I
need to hitch my wagon up to another wagon that is more stable and
reliable than I am. Since the Twelve Step Program encourages me to
embrace my Higher Power, who is a Character 4 of my own inclination and
of my own making rather than the God of another, my left-brain Characters
1 and 2 can relax and feel safe enough to participate. I am willing to give
_my God_, my Character 4 consciousness, the keys to drive my life because
up to this point my left-brain characters have repeatedly driven the vehicle
of my life right off the road into a ditch.

_Hero’s Journey:_

For me to be willing to step out of the rational consciousness of my leftbrain Character 1 and into the unknown consciousness of a Higher Power
Character 4, I must first be aware that this is what I want and then be
willing to follow through. As I defeat my monsters, I become released from
their power to hold me down as my small and fearful self.

**AA Step 4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.**

_Four Characters:_

In order for me to cleanse the path to my Higher Power Character 4, my
Character 1 must take a long, hard look at both the road I have traveled and
the assumptions I have lived by. Many of these assumptions have kept me
bound to my own Character 2’s negligent self-destruction, and her
emotional wounds have played an enormous role in my demise. My
Character 2’s pain has pitted many of the potholes that I have fallen into
and consistently forced me off the road.

_Hero’s Journey:_

On my Hero’s Quest, my Characters 1 and 2 look squarely at my life, and
my Character 2 takes full responsibility for the resentments that I have built
up and lived with over time. In addition, my Character 2 takes full
responsibility for the blame that I have placed on others. As my left-brain
characters become more secure and I become more sober, I begin to

embrace the possibility, and the hope, that there is a different life path out
there for me. A life that is free of this pain and addiction. A life that is free
of these monsters.

**AA Step 5. Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being**
**the exact nature of our wrongs.**

_Four Characters:_

Although I have not yet met my God, the consciousness of my Character
4, I am open, willing, and ready to do what I need to do to create that
relationship with my Higher Power. My Characters 1 and 2 are owning the
mistakes I have made in my life, and I am actively washing my slate clean
as I prepare for this journey into the consciousness of my right brain. I have
seen the success that others have had because their God (Character 4) has
shown up in their lives. I am committed to this process and ready to step out
of my left-brain shame, guilt, and pain and into the right-brain
consciousness of my Character 4 Higher Power.

_Hero’s Journey:_

I, the hero, am embracing this stage of transformation that I must undergo
before I can evolve to the next level of my being. By defeating the monsters
of my past behavior that have held me back, and by admitting to others,
myself, and my Higher Power the unattractive truths of my existence, I am
consciously stepping beyond my pain, out of my left-brain ego-self, and
into my right-brain Character 4, where I will find enlightenment.

**AA Step 6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of**
**character.**

_Four Characters:_

My Characters 1 and 2 have taken complete responsibility for all the
choices I have made, the things I have done, and the pain I have instilled in
others. My Characters 1 and 2 have made peace within myself through a
true forgiveness of my own weaknesses. With an open heart, my left-brain
Characters 1 and 2 recognize that the reason why I have done what I have
done is because of my own deep inner pain, and now that I have
acknowledged and forgiven myself for my shortcomings, I am no longer

paralyzed by them, and I can move forward to create a relationship with my
Character 4 Higher Power.

_Hero’s Journey:_

I am now ready to embark on my quest. I have faced the flaws and
limitations of my left-brain Characters 1 and 2 and accepted responsibility
for my previous actions. I have offered myself forgiveness and cleansed
myself of my wrongdoings, and I am now ready for a real and lasting
change. As the hero, I am now ready to step beyond the consciousness of
my left brain and into the consciousness of my right-brain Character 4 so I
can exist in the peaceful and euphoric consciousness of my Higher Power.

**AA Step 7. Humbly asked God to remove our shortcomings.**

_Four Characters:_

My Characters 1 and 2 have looked deep within and taken complete
responsibility for my weaknesses. At this point I humbly ask my
compassionate Character 4 Higher Power to come into my heart, release my
small-ego Character 2 from its pain, and heal me in a way that I could not
heal myself. Held divinely in the mindset of my right-brain Character 4, I
feel the deep inner peace and unconditional love of this Higher Power as it
restores my hope for a new beginning.

_Hero’s Journey:_

At this point, all of my preparations are completed and I step out of my
left-brain pain into the unconsciousness of my right-brain Character 4. I am
immediately filled with the wisdom of the universe and spontaneously
released from my self-induced, left-brain crucifixions.

**AA Step 8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became**
**willing to make amends to them all.**

_Four Characters:_

Now that I am in communion with my right-brain Higher Power
Character 4, I am on a different path that is rooted in different values. In
order for me to create a new foundation that is solid, however, my
Characters 1 and 2 must look back at the pitfalls of the road I traveled,

make a list of where I deviated from my authentic truth, and assess whom I
have wronged along the way.

I have to live in this world with others, so my Characters 1 and 2 must be
willing to make amends for my past behavior and try to right my history of
wrongs. It is time for me to ask for the grace and forgiveness of others so I
can move down this new road in peace with their blessing. This is how my
Character 1 ends the hustle of _doing_ for my worthiness and steps beyond
the hustle of _being_ what I need to be to be worthy. At this stage I am
actually engaged in relationship and _being_ with the consciousness of my
Character 4. The hustle of my left brain stops here, and I can relax in the
peacefulness of my right-brain consciousness.

_Hero’s Journey:_

I look at my life and acknowledge the challenges as well as the monsters
that I both created and then faced down to get to this point. I have found
peace in this relationship with my Higher Power, and it is now time for me
to examine the amends I need to make with those I turned into monsters
along the way. I need to forgive others and be forgiven by others so I can
release the burden of my past and move on. It is time for me to make a list.

**AA Step 9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible,**
**except when to do so would injure them or others.**

_Four Characters:_

Although I have made peace with myself via my Characters 1 and 2, and
opened the door to my Higher Power Character 4, the road ahead would be
a lot easier for everyone, including those I have hurt, if they would accept
my apology, forgive my past indiscretions, and wish me well on my new
endeavor. Apologizing, and thus neutralizing the pain I have caused in
others, helps me not only step out of the shame of my Character 2 but move
beyond it. It is not enough for me to forgive myself for my past. I need to
own it, forgive it, ask for forgiveness from others, and then genuinely
release it.

_Hero’s Journey:_

When my Character 2 stops fighting and is willing to show up and make
amends with everyone it has scorned, I defeat both the real and imagined
monsters that I have spent a lifetime battling. When my Character 2 is able

to relax and I step into the loving consciousness of my Character 4, I gain
the power to step beyond the shame of my past and into the love of my
Higher Power. At this point, when I accept and forgive myself for the road I
traveled, I release that past pain and open my heart to the beauty of what is
right here, right now in the present moment. By embracing my Character 4,
I embrace my own divine being, and I feel peace.

**AA Step 10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were**
**wrong promptly admitted it.**

_Four Characters:_

My Characters 1 and 2 have enjoyed dominating my life for a very long
time, and they remain well versed in how to live an automated, unconscious
life. It is critical that I pay attention to what is going on inside of my brain
so that I purposely protect myself from reverting to my old left-brain
Character 1 and 2 habits that led me into drinking in the first place.

Now that I am awake in the consciousness of our Character 4, I need to
purposely nurture that relationship so that circuitry can become strong. Our
brains are cells that communicate in circuits, and the more often we run a
circuit, the stronger that circuit becomes. This means that all of my old
addiction circuitry that I have been running for a long time remains wired in
my brain. In order for me to weaken those circuits and escape their cravings
and desires, I need first to get sober and then purposefully and consciously
strengthen my new circuits by continuing to take an honest personal
inventory about what is going on inside.

My Character 2 is the home of my expression of blame, my feelings of
shame, and all of my other deep emotional pains. The cells making up my
Character 2 never mature, which means that these cells will _always_ have a
natural propensity to rerun my old addictive patterns. It is imperative that I
understand that the circuitry underlying my addiction will always be in my
brain, ready to rerun at any moment. This is why I must purposely protect
myself from the cravings and fears of my Character 2, especially when I am
feeling hungry, angry, lonely, or tired (HALT—taught by AA programs).

_Hero’s Journey:_

Once I have met the Character 4 consciousness of my Higher Power, my
spirit is cleansed and I become filled with divine wonder. However, once I

have found this connection, it is important that I nurture and strengthen my
relationship with my Higher Power, because once I return to my old life, my
left-brain Characters 1 and 2 will come right back online and be tempted to
engage in those old behaviors.

**AA Step 11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our**
**conscious contact with God, as we understood Him, praying only for**
**knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.**

_Four Characters:_

When I pay attention and consciously choose to nurture the relationship
between my left-brain Characters 1 and 2 and my right-brain Character 4, I
strengthen that circuitry in my brain. With practice I gain the ability to
instantly step out of the consciousness of my left-brain characters and
directly into the consciousness and peacefulness of my Character 4. This
ability is how I own my power, and how I choose moment by moment who
and how I want to be in the world.

_Hero’s Journey:_

By this point I have found my way beyond the monsters of my past, and I
have stepped into the overwhelming sense of freedom and bliss that exists
at the distant end of my journey. During this spiritual awakening, I have
found the deep inner peace and clarity that I yearned for, as I am now
enveloped in the enlightenment of my Character 4. Not only do I feel better
but I feel relieved of my pain. At this point I will either choose to return to
the left-brain character life that I led before, and share my hard-won
insights with others, or I will choose to keep this newfound wisdom to
myself. If for some reason, once I have returned to my old life, I do not
continue to run my newfound circuitry, I will relapse back into the person I
was before I heeded the journey.

**AA Step 12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these**
**Steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics [others], and to**
**practice these principles in all our affairs.**

_Four Characters:_

Just as the hero returns to his life with a new wisdom, so does the
alcoholic who is in recovery. The alcoholic has traveled from the hell of his

Characters 1 and 2 addiction to the salvation and freedom of his divine,
right-brain Character 4. The alcoholic is now free to consciously live a
different life, knowing full well that the circuitry of his addiction remains
intact, leaving him vulnerable to a relapse at any moment. The alcoholic in
recovery then returns to the world of other alcoholics who are in pain and
shares with them his insights and newly found wisdom. By consciously
choosing to repeat the last few steps of the program routinely, he need not
weaken or flounder. Our alcoholic in recovery is the life-force power of the
universe, and he can consciously choose at any moment which circuitry and
which character he wants to embody.

_Hero’s Journey:_

Just as the alcoholic who is in recovery returns to his life with his new
insight, so does the hero. As I return home and choose to share my
enlightenment with others who are in pain, I offer them hope for a different
path and a brighter tomorrow.



### **THE POWER OF THE BRAIN HUDDLE,** **HERO’S JOURNEY, AND TWELVE STEP** **PROGRAMS**

When I consider the profound impact of these lessons, I am reminded of
one of my favorite Marianne Williamson sermons. She shares with us that
we have the ability to hand our problems over to God, and although God is
on our team, He does not merely jump on board and help us fight the battle.
Rather, He lifts us completely above the battlefield. When I pass something
up to God, when I hand Him a problem, I trust totally that He will do with it
what He thinks is best. I don’t just give my problem up to God for advice or
micromanagement. Instead I consciously step out of the fears, judgments,
and disappointments of my left brain and step into the faith of my Character
4.

I trust implicitly that God (the Infinite Being, the consciousness of the
universe, my Character 4) has a bigger-picture view of my life than my left
brain will ever understand. As a result, when I consciously choose to slip
back into my most loving and peaceful self, I know God is handling the
situation. When I choose to pass a problematic scenario up to God, I am not
shirking my responsibility. I am merely shifting my perspective and
choosing peace over fear and fret. This is the gift and power of the Brain
Huddle, the Twelve Step Programs, and the Hero’s Journey. When we work
these practices with commitment and offer our trust to the power of the
universe, everything changes in our lives and we feel better, because we
have shifted which brain circuitry we are running.

As I shared with you in Chapter 4, when my father was 80, he flipped
and spiraled a cute little Miata. He did not die that day, but I became his
primary caregiver for the next 16 years. In response to his need, my
Character 1 came online to protect my dad and tend to him. If you have
ever been a caregiver, you know the high toll that stress can take on your
peace of heart and mind. In my case, although I felt that I carried all of the
responsibility, I actually had very little power over his behavior. Caught up
in discontent because of his new physical limitations, Hal’s disgruntled

Character 2 showed up without any gratitude for my efforts, even though I
was doing my best to show up as a Soft Character 1.

When my father was not pleased with the decisions I was making on his
behalf, his Character 2 would growl at me. My Character 2 would then
become resentful that he would choose to be hostile toward my Character 1
rather than express gratitude with his Character 4 for my efforts. I was
volunteering to perform a duty that fell to me, so a little gratitude and
support would have gone a long way to help me feel appreciated. You have
probably had a similar experience.

During that time, that Marianne Williamson sermon saved my sanity, as it
was my constant companion on daily walks. I needed desperately to find a
healthy way to neutralize the hostility between me and my dad, so I gave
the problem up to my Character 4 consciousness and stopped ruminating
about our problems. Instead of sparring as two Character 2s, I invited my
dad to a painting class so our Character 3s could have some fun together.
Stepping into my Character 4 consciousness when managing my _dad issues_
didn’t just embolden me in the battle, it lifted me above the battlefield.
Gaining this assistance outside my left-brain judgment and pain generated a
path for us to stay connected in light of our changed circumstances and
fragile emotions.



### **WE ARE ALL RECOVERING**

The entire focus of this chapter has been about how we might influence
and promote the health and well-being of our own brain (and brain cells) so
we can create healthy connections with others, and ultimately become
healthy, contributing members of society. At the level of the Four
Characters, the process of recovery is the same for everyone, regardless of
what promotes the disconnection, be it an addiction or an emotional pain.

Day by day we are all living our lives and facing our own unique
challenges. Incorporating these tools into our daily routine and choosing to
live a healthy life in which we practice the Brain Huddle when we don’t
_need_ it strengthens that circuitry so that we have it available to us when we
do need it. For those who are using the Twelve Step Program, repeating
Steps 10, 11, and 12 on a regular basis mimics the internal reflection of our
Four Characters when they are gathered in the Brain Huddle.

Whether we are recovering from an addiction, hurt feelings, a stubbed
toe, or the loss of a loved one, we have the ability to take a _personal_
_inventory_ and reflect upon our individual journey during every moment of
our lives. When we choose to step into the consciousness of our loving and
compassionate Character 4, we not only feel loved and worthy of that love
but we dissolve into the all-knowingness that we are that love. Our number
one job as living beings is to love one another, and we do this best by first
loving ourselves and then connecting with the other. In addition, when we
allow each other the dignity of our own pain, we grow.



### **COMING UP NEXT**

Ultimately this book has been about the evolution of the human brain
toward whole-brain living and how we can use the Brain Huddle to
purposely increase the number of cellular connections we have between
each of our Four Characters. Once our Four Characters find their way into
the Brain Huddle, we can then consciously shift between those different
modules of circuitry, at will, and choose with ease who and how we want to
be.

In the following chapter we will take a bird’s-eye look at the profound
impact technology has made on the evolution of our human brain over the
last century. More specifically, we will explore the overall impact
technology has made on the prevalence of our Four Characters as they show
up in the different generations, helping explain the phenomenon of our
_generational gaps_ .

When we better understand and relate to the values and behaviors of
those who are different from us, we can learn to connect with them by
focusing on our similarities rather than our differences. Whether it be
neurons in our brain, people in our family, or those who are on the opposite
side of our socioeconomic or political aisle, connection takes energy and
effort, and in the big picture, it enriches our lives. When we choose peace
within us, and we choose peace between us regardless of our differences,
our brains evolve.





**CHAPTER 12**
