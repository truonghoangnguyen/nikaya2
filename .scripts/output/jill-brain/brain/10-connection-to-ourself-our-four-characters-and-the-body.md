# CONNECTION TO OURSELF OUR FOUR CHARACTERS AND THE BODY

Without question, the most important relationship we have is the one
between our brain and our body. How do the Four Characters see this vital
relationship?

Character 1 sees our body as a vehicle.

Character 2 sees our body as a responsibility.

Character 3 sees our body as a toy.

Character 4 sees our body as a temple of the soul.



### **CHARACTER 1**

Character 1s see their body as a vehicle that they use to accomplish
things in the world, so they keep a close eye on how well their machine is
running. Comparable to how they tend to their cars and other mechanical
possessions, Character 1s are committed to getting a physical every year to
make sure everything is functioning properly. Character 1s like information
and believe knowledge is power. Their goal is to nip a problem in the bud,
so routine checkups are purposeful.

Character 1s care about building relationships with their doctors because
when there is a problem, they are interested in consulting with an authority
and then becoming an expert. Character 1s don’t mind spending money for
a job well done, and they are curious about their health and interested in
maintaining it. Because they pay close attention to the performance of the
machine, Character 1s have pretty good body self-awareness. They tend to
notice how they feel, and if something does not feel right, they have it
checked out. Character 1s take personal responsibility for their body and do
not turn that responsibility over to their doctor, coach, or personal trainer.

Character 1s participate in wellness screenings and are good at
scheduling appointments up to a year in advance. They are faithful at taking
supplements and will get up and go to the gym and lift those weights that
they hate to lift if they think doing so will help. Character 1s build that
routine into their schedule because they take pride in what is right about
their body. At the same time, because they are perfectionists and tend to be
critical of their appearance, they are highly motivated to stay fit and look
good. This group plans on living a long, quality life, so they take it upon
themselves to do what they believe they need to do to take care of
themselves.



### **CHARACTER 2**

If our Character 2 is in charge of our relationship with our body, we will
manage our care in a way that is the complete opposite of our Character 1.
Because our Character 2 has very little body awareness, everything health
related feels scary and unknown. Character 2s see knowledge of the body
through the lens of doom and gloom because a million things can and will
go wrong. To the Character 2, the whole medical world is only bad news,
never good news, and every little concern is seen as a potential death
sentence. Since they find the concept of death terrifying, they may die a
thousand deaths inside their minds, long before it’s actually their time to go.

As a result, when our Character 2 comes online in a situation that
involves our health, we strategize our body care in one of two ways. We
either stick our head in the sand, dread the annual examination, and resist
going to the doctor, or we make mountains out of every molehill and
become a frequent visitor to the emergency room. To compound the
problem, our Character 2 will gather and share woeful stories with others
about how someone back home had that problem, and then their arm fell
off. Character 2s live in such a high state of stress and worry that when they
are not in control, their bodies respond with accelerated wear and tear.

Character 2s are not interested in attending wellness screenings or joining
a gym, but they often complain about their aches and pains, without
prodding, to just about anyone who will listen. Because our Character 2s
don’t like to tend to body complications in a timely fashion, they trot off to
the ER for chronic pains but afterward do only the minimum that they have
to do to help themselves. If they are motivated by a friend or a work
wellness program, they may walk around the building for 10 minutes, but as
soon as they feel uncomfortable, they will stop trying. For Character 2s
wellness is all about what is going wrong rather than what is going right. As
a result, the Character 2 will sit on the sidelines and be the first to tell you
all the reasons why it is not a good idea for you to be doing something
active.

Just as the Character 1 wants to meet directly with the physician because
they want to become an expert about their condition, the Character 2 is

happy to share with the more readily available nurse practitioner. The
Character 2 values having a medical audience to whom they can share their
woes more than they care about the medical professionals’ credentials.



### **CHARACTER 3**

Character 3s get excited about anything medical because it’s interesting
and cool. A Character 3 says, “Wow, look at my vitals!” The body is a toy
to a Character 3. It is their playhouse, so they want to use it, challenge it,
and take good care of it. The body is such a curious thing to a Character 3:
“I mean, just look at my toes! When I am excited, they waggle back and
forth just like a tail! Look how high I can jump! Look how fast I can
swim!”

More than any of the others, Character 3s have a deep and intimate body
consciousness. They care about strength training, quality of performance,
and perfecting their timing. Character 3s are curious about how much they
can achieve with their body and how well they can get it to perform.
Character 3s live in their body and will push it toward its optimal
performance. “I know I can hike that trail in eighty minutes, so can I hike it
with twenty pounds on my back in ninety minutes?” Fitness is fun and a
great way to pass the time for a Character 3.

Although Character 3s may not have an annual exam on their calendar,
they will take advantage of local community wellness programs as they
happen upon them. Character 3s celebrate their body, so living a highly
active lifestyle is natural for them. For exercise, instead of just hitting the
weights in a gym, Character 3s will go out and do something fun and
adventurous. They would rather build a stone path where every step weighs
90 pounds, or master a climbing wall in the local park, than work a routine
in the gym. Overall, Character 3s have a higher rate of emergency visits due
to acute breaks and misfortunes because they are out pushing their bodies
on a regular basis, and accidents happen.



### **CHARACTER 4**

Character 4s see the body as the holy temple of the soul. As such, they
are grateful for the miraculous gift of life, and they function inside a
wellness frame of mind whereby they accept the responsibility of tending to
the well-being of the temple. Character 4s nurture their mind/body/spirit by
engaging in self-care. They embrace holistic and alternative methods of
nurturing their body and stimulating their senses.

Massage, yoga, essential oils, and other holistic practices speak to the
heart of the Character 4. When possible, they are members of food co-ops
and eat organic foods in an attempt to minimize their chemical toxicity.
Character 4s are active members of their community, and it is important to
them to support their local farmers’ market. Gluten and animal products
may or may not be a part of their menu, and they are open to taking natural
supplements.

Character 4s believe in going to their local acupuncturist, osteopath,
chiropractor, or neuro-movement specialist as a part of their wellness
routine, particularly when something needs attention. Character 4s are
committed to going outside for a walk on a beautiful day or purposefully
stretching on the floor in front of their TV. You will find Character 4s hoedee-doing around the park or neighborhood with a friend or pet. They will
pause and enjoy a meaningful chat with a squirrel, hug a familiar tree, and
open their hearts to the nature around them, as they are deeply connected to
all life. Character 4s will not just remember to bring goodies to feed the
wildlife at the park, they will stop on the way to buy extra. These random
acts of kindness are important to the Character 4 and directly contribute to
their overall well-being.



### **HOW THE FOUR CHARACTERS MANAGE** **AN ILLNESS** **Character 1**

When it comes to managing an illness, Character 1s are informed
patients. Their linear thinking kicks in, their rational minds turn on, and
they study to become a specialist. The diagnosis becomes their full-time
job, so they assess the problem quickly, learn everything there is to know
about it, and then manage the situation with absolute precision. Take the
example of a chronic illness such as type 1 diabetes. To manage this
disease, Character 1s will change their diet and avoid eating sugar at all
costs. They tune in to their body and want the most recent technology and
analytics, so they will invest in the most accurate continuous glucose
monitors and insulin tubeless pumps that will deliver instantaneous
analytics through a phone app.
### **Character 2**

Our Character 2 already sees the medical world as all bad news, so facing
a real illness like type 1 diabetes is enough to overwhelm them and render
them paralyzed with fear. As a result, they succumb to the feeling of being
distraught. They stick their head in the sand and try to ignore the problem
for as long as they possibly can. These are the folks who will sneak sugar
and never fully embrace a healthy management of their own protocols. It’s
not that they don’t care, but to the immature Character 2, fear and anxiety
can be so overpowering that these people cannot think clearly about what
they need to do to help restore their health.

Some very healthy Character 1s, 3s, and 4s may find that they turn into a
petrified Character 2 when they become ill, simply because of the fear
many of us harbor about dying. When we do devolve into our Character 2

around a severe illness, we become more interested in what we can get
away with, rather than what we might do to help ourselves. Remember: our
Character 2 represents our potentially self-destructive five-year-old.

If we do dive into our Character 2 out of fear of a diagnosis, hopefully
there is a responsible Character 1 around who is willing to help us, or a
Character 4 who is available to nurture us. Oftentimes, however, our
Character 2 may try to force the impossible job of managing our illness
onto someone else. But of course, they would get all of that responsibility
without an ounce of our cooperation. To make things worse, our Character
2s are not interested in messing around with the latest medical technology.
Partly because we would feel tethered to the machinery, and let’s face it, we
can’t cheat on our sugar intake if someone is monitoring the data.
### **Character 3**

Character 3s will minimize the severity of the diagnosis and say, “It’s not
that big of a deal.” Because they don’t want to give up their sweets,
Character 3s will find a way to work around the problem and find sugarless
candies and cookies that won’t spike their sugar. They will explore the
influence of substitute sweeteners on their sugar levels and will want to use
the latest tubeless insulin pump technology because it’s cool, fast, and easy.
Besides that, Character 3s are not disciplined enough to test their blood
sugar every two hours, so they view the latest technology and phone app as
a ticket to free living that they can take with them everywhere they go.
### **Character 4**

Character 4s want to know what their options are and will make friends
with their diagnosis. This character is all about the health and wholeness of
their body/mind/spirit. Character 4s will take responsibility and use
alternative medical options to manage their problems. They will visit
naturopaths, chiropractors, acupuncturists, and various types of energy
healers. For diabetes type 1, like Character 3s, Character 4s will explore the
influence of honey, agave, chicory, and coconut sugar on their sugar levels.

They want to be easy on their body, so they will use meditation to lower
their stress, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels.

Character 4s will set a routine for regular movement and exercise to
improve their medical numbers. They will welcome the ease that new
technology offers and explore the latest in testing and pumps. Character 4s
show up for themselves and accept what reality is, and they will do what
they need to do to manifest a positive prognosis. It is the Character 4 in
each of us that will embrace with gratitude the silver lining of having had
the chance to have this challenging experience.



### **HOW THE FOUR CHARACTERS MANAGE** **FITNESS, DIET, AND DIETING** **Character 1**

When it comes to taking care of their body, Character 1s take
responsibility and hold themselves accountable for the shape they are in.
When they hit their top weight, they take action to not go one ounce over
the limit. Character 1s are disciplined people, so when it comes to exercise
and portion control, they do what they need to do to keep their vehicle
running well. They are busy people and have a lot to accomplish, so it is
natural for them to address their body consciously.

When they want to lose weight, Character 1s are going to count food
points, be disciplined, and diet effectively. They will set up their kitchen
with everything they need and learn the system and be good at it. They will
use cleanses to jump-start their diet and suggest that their partner, or others
in the house, join them on the program, since they are good at helping and
supporting others.
### **Character 2**

Our Character 2s become intimidated by the number on the scale and
look for the quick fix. Any diet is seen as pure punishment, because it
means that we must deprive ourselves of something we want. As a result,
Character 2s buck the system, cheat, and do not succeed because they see
themselves as powerless over their desires. Character 2s will exert the
minimal amount of energy, and as soon as they become uncomfortable or
don’t see success, they will bemoan the process and indulge in more
calories. If a Character 2 does lose any weight, they will complain, “Oh
gosh, it almost killed me!”

Character 2s are not disciplined enough to take on a complex pointcounting system, but they will try the latest fad pills or electronic muscle
stimulators. The Character 2 is willing to order prepackaged food because
they don’t want to exert any real effort. Character 2s will starve themselves
and then binge and then starve themselves again. If they are lucky, they are
living with a Character 1 who is willing to do all the work for the pointcounting system, and under these conditions they may actually succeed, but
only if the Character 1 polices the pantry.
### **Character 3**

Character 3s will figure out how many donuts or how much ice cream
they can eat and then exercise enough to ensure they do not gain a pound.
This is the character who is going to binge like a maniac in the present
moment, ruining the last three days of their diet, but then hike five miles a
day for the next three days to make up for it. Character 3s will eat the entire
bag of potato chips and then eat nothing except vegetables for the next few
days. If motivated to drop some pounds, they will eat smoothies, protein
shakes, or healthy granola bars.

Character 3s have a good sense of how their body burns the energy they
put into it, so although they will not be motivated to count calories or
points, they will limit what kinds of foods they eat based upon how those
foods make them feel. Character 3s are very sensitive to the influence of
what they eat and how that impacts their energy level. Character 3s will do
the South Beach Diet simply because it sounds like fun: “Yay, I get to go to
the Beach! Hey! I’m doing the Beach, what about you?” They will eat
prepackaged food because of the convenience but then binge by having a
veggie burger with no bun, just to see how far they can go on the diet
without being totally compliant. Character 3s will eat everything in sight, in
general, because they consume, consume, consume and are always hungry
because they are always in motion.
### **Character 4**

Character 4s are looking for a healthy balance between work, family,
play, friends, and time with their Higher Power. They go to yoga class,
attend retreats, get massages, and meditate. They generally don’t want to
consume anything that has a face, or breathes, so they are often vegetarian,
vegan, or they at least stick to an organic diet. To balance a minor weight
gain, they will cut back on calories through portion control or eat more
fruits and vegetables.

Character 4s know that you can never out-exercise a bad diet. They feel
better when eating more protein or high fiber and will change the entire way
they eat if they need to. They consume a whole-foods diet, and everything
is in moderation. Character 4s conceptually carry that donut all the way out,
from the yummy taste bud to seeing that donut right there on their left hip.



### **HOW THE FOUR CHARACTERS RELATE TO** **MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS** **Character 1**

Character 1s are interested in following the most direct path to a solution,
so they will beeline themselves straight into their personal doctor’s office.
Or they will make a phone call to a medical line or use a tele-doctor. The
Character 1 wants the M.D. degree with the biggest solution for the
problem. They want to speak with the expert because they want to learn
everything they can about the problem and become an expert on the issue
themselves.

When it comes to compliance with a course of treatment, Character 1s
are equally direct. They will follow the doctor’s orders and work the
designated program. They will go above and beyond the minimum effort to
get well. They will change their exercise routine as well as food choices
with minimal complaining. Character 1s see the need for change as a
challenge that is worth the outcome of regaining their health.
### **Character 2**

Our Character 2 will use the emergency room because they are dying
every time they feel bad, and they will bring the 20-pound solution to the 5ounce problem. Or they will be on a first-name basis with the clinic’s nurse
practitioner, whom they will seek out often. Character 2s want all the tests
they can get just to make sure nothing is missed, but because they look for
the worst possible outcome, they become overwhelmed.

Character 2s will Google the morbidity rate of a hangnail and then bring
it up as casual conversation at the dinner table to anyone who will listen.
Although Character 2s want the confirmation that they are really sick, they
don’t want to hear the protocol to regain full health, because the whole

medical/body phenomenon is terrifying and intimidating. Anything the
doctors have to say about life changes will simply limit their quality of life,
so they don’t really want to hear it . . . but yet they do . . . but yet they don’t.

Character 2s see dietary and lifestyle changes as a punishment, a loss of
freedom, a limitation to their quality of life, a sacrifice, a pain in the neck,
and just one more thing they have to manage. If they even bother to try to
stay on a medical protocol, they will not be enthusiastic about it or do it
well.
### **Character 3**

Character 3s do well with the convenience of the walk-in care center.
They want the “Doc in the box” so they don’t have to schedule an
appointment but can slip in on a whim. These urgent care centers get you in
and out quickly, and the Character 3 likes that. They tell you what you need
to know in order for you to get better, and you don’t have to establish a
relationship with the doctor. If you meet with a nurse practitioner, that’s
okay too, as long as they have the expertise to meet your need.

Once they’ve received a prescription or a course of treatment, Character
3s will use modern technology to set a schedule, and they will try to find a
way to work around the problem. They may be strict about some things and
push the envelope with others. Character 3s will set an alarm on their phone
to remind them to take their meds on time, and then figure out what is the
outer limit of what they need to do to be successful. Like Character 1s,
Character 3s are looking for best practices and will find a way to win.
Character 3s may join a support group because they like to collaborate with
others, as they thrive on conquering a situation through a team effort.
### **Character 4**

The holistic approach appeals to the Character 4. They think in the big
picture of the whole body and want to know the minimum they need to do
to get the maximum return for their efforts. The Character 4’s focus is on
prevention, and they will seek alternative types of practitioners to promote

their own healing. Character 4s are good with less invasive alternative
providers and tend to manage their wellness long before any illness sets in.

Character 4s will get on board with the medical establishment just
enough to pacify the acute situation and then explore alternative options to
manage a long-term problem. For example, instead of taking a statin to
lower a high-cholesterol issue, the Character 4 will master the combination
of honey and cinnamon. Instead of sticking to an intense physical therapy
program that would rehabilitate their rotator cuff to its limitation, a
Character 4 would work with an Anat Baniel NeuroMovement practitioner
over the long term to regain complete function.



### **HOW THE FOUR CHARACTERS AGE WELL:** **PHYSICALLY, MENTALLY, EMOTIONALLY,** **AND SPIRITUALLY** **Character 1**

Character 1s take care of themselves and do what they need to do
throughout their lifetime to maintain the machine. They are conscious of
their body and hyperaware of their aging. They notice the need for
maintenance and exercise because they want the result, not for the love of
the game. Character 1s will take care of themselves and nip and tuck as they
age, and they would be the type to keep a pair of shorts from their college
years, just to see if they can still fit in them.

If a Character 1 splurges during the holidays, because they have rigid
boundaries, they will work hard in the New Year to lose what they gained.
If a Character 1 has a joint replacement, they will educate themselves on the
best doctors and the latest in prosthesis. They will take responsibility for
their physical therapy, practice between sessions, and enthusiastically adopt
the new device as a better part of themselves. They will then get back into
life and continue their exercise routine.

As they get older, many Hard Character 1s will pivot from expressing
harsh judgment to expressing a softer sense of gratitude. With this shift
comes a natural deepening of their relationship with their body, with
themselves, with others, and with their Higher Power. Life tends to whittle
away at our edges, and with retirement come new opportunities and
choices. Living life as a Hard Character 1 is isolating, no matter the age,
because they have not nurtured a loving tribe or community. In the long run,
the financial wealth a Hard Character 1 may have acquired can buy a lot of
things, but you cannot buy a loyal fishing buddy or kindness from a
palliative-care nurse.

### **Character 2**

Because the cells of our Character 2 are programmed as our
fight/flight/freeze sympathetic nervous system, we are neurologically wired
to bring information in from the present moment and then compare that
with every experience we have ever had. Our Character 2 cells sort and
match the worst possible outcomes and then inject that insight into our
present-moment consciousness. As a result, we fall victim to our feelings of
loss, pain, fear, anxiety, and threat, simply because this part of our brain is
wired to do so.

To complicate matters the cells making up our Character 2 are the same
cells that are specifically designed to perceive ourselves as a single solid
entity, separate from everything else around us. Long gone are the days
when we symbiotically existed in our mother’s womb, and gone are the
days when all we could perceive was the enveloping feeling of cosmic love.

When it comes to our health and well-being over the expanse of a
lifetime, if our Character 2 is in charge, wellness will be hard-earned, if
possible at all. The fear that our Character 2 brings to the forefront of our
consciousness can be strangling and constricting. Without any discipline or
set upper limits on weight gain, no one takes ownership or responsibility for
the body. With increased age older Character 2s will live in the glory days
of times past and share stories about how they used to be able to do this and
that.

Character 2s feel their aches and pains and then use them as an excuse to
not do anything more. They focus on what they cannot do rather than what
they still can do. When they have surgery to get a new body part, like a new
joint, Character 2s are afraid to use it. Although they will go to physical
therapy, they will put in the minimal amount of effort they can get away
with and then have limited recovery and blame their failure on a bad
system.

If a Character 2 is going to age at all gracefully, they must have a change
of heart and mind and be willing to let their other characters step in to
create some ease in the matter of their health. Personally, I hate going to the
doctor now because one day way back when (worst-case scenario), I had to
have my head cut open, and who on earth would ever want to see something
like that happen again? My Character 2 believes that if I don’t go to a
doctor, no one will find anything wrong with me and I’ll never have to go

through something like that again. Right? Wrong. My Character 2’s fear is
so powerful that it gives me a million excuses to not abide any preventative

care.

Clearly the price we pay to live with the belief that we are individually
independent people who have free will is the consternation of our Character
2. Fortunately that part of our brain coexists with our Characters 1, 3, and 4,
who all have the capacity to interact with, intercept, and integrate our
behaviors. None of us is getting out of this life alive, so once all of our Four
Characters agree that our ultimate goal is to live well, and die well, we can
all weigh in on what we need to do to make that happen.
### **Character 3**

Character 3s can run wild and crazy with our health during our youth,
and hopefully get away with it, but somewhere along the line we need to
recognize our limitations. As youngsters we didn’t measure how much
water we were drinking, we just drank to satisfy our thirst. As we age we
need to place a little more focus on health rather than fun and calculate
longevity versus risk. As our Character 3s become more aware and
intentional about what our bodies need, and what limitations we need to set
on our risk-taking behaviors, our overall health will thrive.
### **Character 4**

As our Character 4 ages, we need to pay closer attention to what our
body is telling us and then engage in behaviors that will increase our brain’s
awareness of our body. The more powerful our divine Character 4 becomes,
the less well connected we are to the physical world. Continuing a practice
of yoga, tai chi, or anything else that will help us ground ourselves in our
muscle groups will help us stay connected to the physical world. As we age,
our minds naturally shift more into the realm of the mysterious, so
intentionally choosing to increase our brain’s discernment of our body is a
really good idea.

Now that we have examined how our Four Characters relate to our body
in both wellness and illness, let’s expand our perception and take a closer

look at how the Four Characters predictably respond to, relate to, and
interact in relationship with others.





**CHAPTER 10**
