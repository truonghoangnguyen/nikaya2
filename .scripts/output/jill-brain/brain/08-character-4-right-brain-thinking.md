# CHARACTER 4 RIGHT BRAIN THINKING

_our_
Welcome to our Character 4. I say because this is the part of our
consciousness, our right thinking brain that we share with one another, and
all other life. I see the brain cells underlying our Character 4 as the portal
through which the energy of the universe enters into and fuels every cell of
our body. This energy and its consciousness fill up our entire being. We are
swimming in it, and it is swimming in us. There is no separation. Our
Character 4 is the all-knowing intelligence from which we came, and it is
how we incarnate the consciousness of the universe.

Although we are an amazing form of life, we are atoms and molecules in
motion. As I mentioned in the chapter on Character 1, our left brain refined
our level of processing such that we could lift our focus up beyond the level
of the molecular flow into the realm of external _things_ . However, when we
devolve our perception from the level of _things_ back down to the level of
the atoms that compose all things, we return our focus to the level of the
particulate matter from which we originated. The consciousness of this
microcosmic flow remains omnipotent and omnipresent. We never left it,
we are never without it, and it is the river of peace that flows through our
veins.

We embody this peace when we tune in to the consciousness of our
Character 4. However, in order to do this, we must quiet the thoughts of our
Character 1, which is obsessed with the details of life in the external world.
We must settle the emotional volatility and reactivity of our Character 2 and
distract our focus away from the experiential sensations being processed by
our Character 3. These three characters make a lot of noise inside our head,
and we need to quiet it all down if we are going to expand in the
consciousness of our Character 4.

I think of the four different consciousnesses of our Four Characters as
though they are different instruments playing in a string quartet. The two
violins play the melody and the piercing high notes soar above the other

sounds, making them easily heard. The cello brings in a bass line of
supportive low tones that is readily distinguishable from the higher notes of
the violins. The viola, however, plays notes that are not quite as high as the
violins or as low as the cello. This is why these middle tones of the viola
can blend so well with the others that they become difficult to identify,
while at the same time they form the glue that melds all the other notes
together into a balanced sound.

Although the viola may be difficult to hear when everyone is playing, if it
were not there, the unity of the overall sound would lack luster. At the level
of the Four Characters, the role of the viola represents the consciousness of
our Character 4. The two violins symbolize our left-brain Characters 1 and
2, which can be loud and overshadowing, while the cello denotes the lower
body tones of our Character 3. We must listen carefully to hear our
Character 4, and when all the other instruments agree to play more softly,
the strong, exquisite tones of the viola’s voice can be heard. Our Character
4, like the viola, is the glue that balances the expression of our Four
Characters.

If your Character 1 is having a hard time wrapping its mind around the
validity or existence of the consciousness of Character 4, I recognize that it
is natural for Character 1 to possibly judge the unfamiliar, unknown, and

_woo-woo_
mystical as . Yet throughout the history of man, and in varied
cultures around the world, humans have designed techniques, tools, and
strategies ranging from religious dogma and prayer to meditation and yoga
to access this realm of consciousness and experience their Character 4. Carl
Jung spoke of the Self as the archetypal part of ourselves that was the
unification of our unconsciousness with our consciousness. We know it is
there, but how to access it has been the challenge, and each of the
characters goes about this in different ways.

Because our left brain thrives on separating and dividing everything into
categories so it can create order and make sense in the external world, it
decided that science and spirituality are two subjects that are so polarized
that they both cannot exist. As a scientist I never understood this frame of
mind, because science is the strategic tool that we use to explore what we
do not understand, and clearly we do not understand the realm of our right
brain.

Unfortunately the scientific method, which good scientists are supposed
to use to perform quality research, is by definition a linear-based method

that the left brain has designed so it can measure everything and replicate an
experiment in order to test a hypothesis. This is quite limiting, of course,
since the scientific method as it currently stands is only available to prove
and validate things in the external world of our Character 1. We can only
use a linear technique to study linear phenomena.

If something is not measurable or if experimental results cannot be
replicated, our left brain will often either choose to deny its existence or
negate its value altogether. This gap between what we can study in the
conscious realm of our left brain, versus everything else that is neither
measurable nor replicable in the realm of our right-brain consciousness,
requires that we take a leap of faith if we are going to wrap our minds
around understanding it. It is reassuring to note that a lot of really creative
research is currently going on that is both stretching the boundaries of the
scientific method and building a bridge between the dogma of science and
the experience of spirituality.

The consciousness of our Character 4 is our constant companion, as it is
the energy within which we exist. This consciousness is woven into every
cell of our body and every molecule in the universe. It is the energy ball
within which we live and breathe and have our being. It is the source of our
life, and it is the experience we yearn to achieve through various practices.
Our Character 4’s consciousness is the most distant destination of our
Hero’s Journey, and returning to this consciousness is a coming home to our
precious and most peaceful self. Our Character 4 is our authenticity, as it is
the part of ourselves that we share with the One. Yet that does not negate
the understanding that each of our Four Characters is individually authentic.



### **FROM COSMIC ENERGY TO HUMAN LIFE**

Our Character 4 is the original consciousness that we were born with,
before our brain and body were neurologically wired up for function. Long
before our infant brain could define where the boundaries of our body
began and ended, we were just a ball of energy infusing and radiating
around a lump of cellular life.

Following our conception when our father’s DNA combined with our
mother’s DNA, that single zygote cell would develop into our fetal body. It
embarked upon its maturation toward human life, powered by the energetic
consciousness of the universe. That individual zygote cell contained the
molecular genius necessary for it to metamorphize into who we are today.

Over the course of a nine-month gestation, that ball of cosmic energy (the
consciousness of our Character 4) directed the expression of our genes,
which contained the blueprint of our molecular profile. As a result, the cells
that would make up our form developed at a rate of 250,000 new cells per
second. (Yes, per second, not per minute!) As impossible as that may be to
imagine, that universal power of our Character 4 consciousness directed our
transformation from the single zygote cell into the structure of our emerging
body.

By the time we completed a normal nine-month gestation, all of the cells
making up our tissues, organs, and organ systems were lined up in perfect
formation and ready for our next stage of development that would occur
when we left the womb. By the time we were born, although those trillions
of cells making up our brain and body were structurally organized and in
position, they existed at various levels of function. For example, the cells of
our diaphragmatic muscle of respiration were already wired up with our
reptilian brain stem cells, so at the time of our birth we were able to breathe.
Our skeletal muscles, however, and the rest of our motor system, although
set up and in position, would require external stimulation to mature.

At the time of our birth, the ball of energy surrounding the mass of cells
that we had developed into while in the womb blended fluidly with the
energy of the external world, as they were one and the same. Of course, the
journey of our birth from that warm liquid womb into the oxygen-rich

gaseous air was by definition not only shocking to our biological system but
was also our original separation from our connection with something that
had been both protective and nurturing.

In the moment of our birth, we gained our physical individuality, but we
would never shed the shared consciousness of the universal energy that
infused our every cell. Why do we love babies? Perhaps it has something to
do with how easy it is for our Character 4 to be drawn out as we mirror the
consciousness of their Character 4. All you have to do is look into the eyes
of a new soul and see its beauty. When we unfold their little hands with our
fingers and smell the scent of their heads, it transports us into a
remembrance of our own innocence, vulnerability, and innate wholeness.
With birth we celebrate the miracle of life and this wondrous transformation
with an eternal hope for a future of all humanity that is wide open with
possibilities.

When we are born, in response to our new environment our infantile
brain physiologically shifts to a higher level of information processing, as
the consciousnesses of our Characters 2 and 3 come online to process new
levels of input. In an instant, our sensory systems are flooded with bold
stimulation including bright lights, loud sounds, and direct touch, all of
which had been muted by the liquid environment of the womb. Considering
that our brain’s wiring is a product of both nature and nurture, stimulation
now streaming full force through our sensory systems is initially perceived
as chaos because those systems are not yet fully mature. Yet our brain is a
masterful tool specifically gifted in its ability to create order from disorder
and make sense from nonsense.

At the time we are born, we have no definition of our physical
boundaries and our brain cells require stimulation from the external world
in order to establish the circuits and future networks necessary for us to
define and control our muscles. As a side note, this is why it is so important
that infants not be tightly swaddled for hours on end, and instead be
allowed to flail their limbs about. When we are infants, every random
movement of our limbs sends information from the muscles crossing the
joints up to our brain about our position in space. When we are born, we are
merely a collection of cells with an undefined and unrefined consciousness.
These arbitrary motor movements are critical for normal brain development
and should be encouraged. Our brain learns quickly, and as we gain

awareness of our physical boundaries, we also achieve a rudimentary
control of our limbs.

It is also important to be aware that when we are born our brains are not a
blank slate, as our genetic profile carries with it innate and instinctual
wisdom. The chromosomes of our DNA are made up of the exact same four
molecules as other mammals, which means that we are coded at the level of
our genomic inheritance to share patterned responses and insights from our
genetic predecessors. Just as an example, we humans share 99.4 percent [2] of
our genetic code with the chimpanzee, and a part of that coding includes
instinctual and protective insights.



### **BRAIN CELLS AND CONSCIOUSNESS**

As I noted earlier, we are feeling creatures who think rather than thinking
creatures who feel. When we are born, the circuitry of our emotional
Characters 2 and 3 are far better developed than the higher-thinking
circuitry of our Characters 1 and 4. When our two emotional Characters 2
and 3 come fully online, our overall attention becomes focused on filtering
the inundation of sensations streaming in from the external world. When we
start processing information as our Characters 2 and 3, we become
distracted away from the awareness and the more subtle and omnipotent
consciousness of our Character 4.

Functionally, the cells of our Character 4 exist at the neuroanatomical
junction between the experiential physical life of our Character 3 and the
boundless consciousness of the universe. In other words, it is the Character
4 part of our brain that _is_ a spiritual being having a physical experience.
And as such our Character 4 is our connection to our Higher Power
whereby we exist as a part of the Infinite Being. Use whatever language is
comfortable for your belief system, but this character exists as the cosmic
consciousness.

With time, this consciousness of our Character 4 energy ball, which is
both the life-force power of the universe and the consciousness of our cells,
shifts silently into the background of our perception. The easiest way I
know of to hook back into this eternal state of peacefulness is to
consciously choose to bring my mind to the present moment and then
expand my consciousness to embody a deep sense of gratitude. I do this
regularly through the practice of the Brain Huddle, which we will focus on
in the next chapter.

Inside the expanded consciousness of our Character 4, where we have no
physical boundaries or sense of our own individuality, we perceive
ourselves to be both as big as the universe and enveloped in the deep,
eternal love of the cosmic flow. The _feeling_ of the cosmos, the _sensation_ of
an all-pervading experience of deep inner peace and love, is available to us
in life and is what we will return to in death. Within this awareness that we
are safe regardless of our physical circumstance, we can exhale into this

experience of deep inner peace and contentment, where we are perfect,
whole, and beautiful. The road to true enlightenment is knowing that this
eternal peace is our future, present, and past.

One of my favorite books on this subject is _Why God Won’t Go Away_ by
Drs. Andrew Newberg and Eugene d’Aquili. These scientists authored the
famous research in which they studied monks and Franciscan nuns by using
a SPECT machine to determine what happens in the brain during meditation
or prayer. What these scientists learned was that instead of finding an area
in the brain that would light up when these folks felt a connection with the
eternal, God, or feeling at One with the Universe, they instead found that
the language and other left-brain centers became silent.



### **CHARACTER 4 IN THE WORLD**

Our left-brain Characters 1 and 2 interpret the space between any two
_things_ to mean that they are separate. Science teaches us that there is an
electromagnetic field of atoms and molecules that surrounds us, and that we
exist within it and it exists within us. Our left brain is unaware of this sea of
energy because a small group of cells in our parietal region defines the
boundaries of our body, surmising the separation. How different would our
world be if we understood that we have the power through our thoughts and
emotions to influence this field of energy? Perhaps gaining this insight into
whole-brain living is humanity’s collective Hero’s Journey and how we will
evolve as a species to live our lives with purpose.

We humans are energy beings that transmute one form of energy into
another. For example, through our sensory systems we transform vibrational
patterns into sound or vision, which is completely dependent on the
structure and function of those specific neurons. We are energy beings
having a physical experience, and we are not simply vibrational receivers or
mechanical achievers through the use of our muscles and limbs. Instead we
have the power to organize our thoughts and communicate via language
using the vibrational tones of our voices, as well as many of the more subtle
forms of communication that we discussed as gifts of our Character 3.

The energy that fuels the movements of the planets and stars is the exact
same energy that forms the consciousnesses of both the overall universe and
our Character 4. There is no division in the particulate matter that makes up
everything, and it is all in motion. Because we are neither disconnected nor
separate from the universal flow, we humans have the power to focus our
minds and emotions and purposely shift that energy. Through the power of
prayer and the power of setting our intention, we have the power to
consciously change the way that energy flows.

When we purposely focus our intention and send those vibrations out into
the great unknown, change happens. We are powerful beyond measure, not
just within our brains but in how we can use our brains to influence the
energy field and thus the world around us. At its core, this is why the book

and movie _The Secret_ had such mass appeal. Energetically this relationship
between us and the space around us is real.

I hook into my Character 4’s consciousness that exists in the eternal flow
when I shift my mind into the present moment, focus on my breath, and feel
my heart expand to connect with the breeze that both brushes my face and
simultaneously rustles the leaves on the trees. When this happens, I shift out
of my left brain’s perceived boundaries and meld into the energy. I _become_
the movement of the flow and shift into _being_ that elusive thing. I am not
only the leaf, but I am the energy that moves the leaf. I am not just the bird
that soars, I am the energy that lifts the wing so the bird can pivot even
higher. I am not just the kiss of the breeze upon my face, but I am the
warmth within it. I am not just the purr of a kitten, but I am the energy of
love that radiates in that vibration.

I connect with my Character 4 by extending myself out into the sparkling
colorful light of a rainbow as I remember what it feels like to sparkle. I shift
into my Character 4 as I devolve into the energy of that loving gaze
between a mother and her nursing infant. My Character 4 is everywhere and
in everything, and during these moments I delight in the glorious bliss of
just being alive. My Character 4 revels in the bond I’ve grown to know with
the great blue heron as it squawks to me “good day” on its morning rounds,
and at dusk I empathize with the owl as she calls for her mate to come
home for dinner. Together in that shared and sacred consciousness, we are
all family here as one ball of energy.

There are so many wonderful poets and musicians who have iterated the
bliss of our Character 4: beautiful souls who have seen themselves in the
reflection of God, not separate from it, and then shared that with the rest of
us. The gift of poetry in the form of music fluidly seeps meaning into the
distant crevasses of our being, and nothing has ever more completely
summed up the soul of my Character 4 than singer/songwriter Carrie
Newcomer’s _Bare to the Bone_ :

_Here I am without a message_

_Here I stand with empty hands_

_Just a spirit tired of wandering like a stranger in this land_

_Walking wide-eyed through this world is the only way I’ve known_

_Wrapped in hope and good intentions and_

_Bare to the bone_

Just as our Character 4 can profoundly influence our use of language to
converse in deep and soul-stirring ways, this part of our consciousness is
open, aware, and accepting that everything is exactly as it should be. Our
Character 4 does not judge, it simply celebrates with wonder the life that it
lives. This part of our character teaches our other characters that we are not
just worthy of being loved but that we _are_ love. When our left-brain
characters open their hearts to the wholeness of their right-brain Character
4, any lack of worthiness instantly disappears. We cannot experience
ourselves as unworthy of love and be the love of the universe in the same

moment.

Because of the way our brain develops, children are often more
comfortable with their Character 4s than adults. As we age and assign
higher value to the skills and consciousnesses of our left-brain characters,
we become more comfortable in the external reality of our left brain and
less comfortable in what becomes unconscious and unknown. This makes
sense, of course, because we learn the rules of society and how to focus at
the level of _things_ early on. We learn how to pick up our toys, how to not
get lost in the grocery store, and how to use our _inside_ voice. We are trained
when we are very young how to follow the rules of society and honor the
values of the world.

Consequently, for many of us, the mere idea of dropping our left brain’s
focus on identity feels like a terrifying death, but it’s really more like
wading into a cold mountain stream on a hot summer day. At first it feels
shocking, and then you go a little deeper and your body begins to acclimate.
Before you know it, the water is waist-high, and although this may be the
coldest water in which you have ever been, your body tingles and your
whole soul wells up with amazement as you dive in. Taking that first step
into the water is heeding the call of your Hero’s Journey. Eventually your
ego acclimates to the understanding that it will not die if you simply set it
momentarily aside. Your ego remains right there, always available to be
immediately brought back online if you choose that. But when you permit
yourself to embark upon the journey, both insight and growth await you.

It can be simple for us to step into this consciousness of the unknown
when we strip off our judgments, our schedule, and our worries and choose
to really enter the realm of the present moment. Go jump into a mud puddle
without thinking about the mess or consequences, and encourage that
overwhelming sense of jubilee to erupt from your soul. Remember that
childlike joy you used to experience? Just thinking about it radiates a smile
right down to my core. When we are willing to step out of the properness of
our suit, our ego, or our justification of our value, and we let ourselves land
in the here and now, life is messy, so let it be what it is and revel in it.

Who are you when you set down your self-doubt, judgment, and
criticism? Who might you be if you believed in yourself like your Character
4 believes in you? Who might you be if you identified and embodied this
part of you in every moment of every day? How vast would you be if you
set yourself free from those left-brain boundaries and limitations? This
Character 4 part of you is always right there, connected to everything and
loving you perpetually. It is the majesty of the mountains when we pause
and breathe it in, and it is in the energy of the ripples as they dance across a
surface.

This sacred awareness of your Character 4 is omnipotent and just beyond
your focus, and no one else can take you there but you. Although you may
be physically alone, this part of you is incapable of loneliness because it is
the love that is woven into the consciousness of everything. Our Character 4
is grateful for the gift of life, accepts what is, and delights in the passing of
time.

As the poet Rumi so eloquently invited, “Out beyond ideas of
wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field. I’ll meet you there. When the
soul lies down in that grass, the world is too full to talk about.” Our
Character 4 is this part of who we are that resides both at the core of our
being and at the edge of the veil of whatever lies beyond. I will meet you in
that field . . .



### **CHARACTER 4 AT WORK AND AT PLAY** **Character 4 on the Job**

Character 4 is the anchor of any corporate ship. Each of the other three
characters rocks the boat in their own unique ways, but Character 4 is the
predictable, reasonable, big-picture, unbiased perspective of how it all fits
together, flows collectively, and works—or not. Character 4 is not afraid of
the money situation, no matter what it is, and is not attached to its egocenter because it does not have one. It is aware of the egos of others, of
course, but Character 4 is completely available to assess the big-picture
performance of the overall machine. It thinks in systems: _If we do this, then_
_that will happen, so then we need to counter that with this in order to create_
_balance._

Our Character 4 can juggle nine details at the same time and not be
paralyzed with fear or feel overwhelmed by a complex task. Character 4
looks at all the parts as different pieces of the whole, but its strengths and
insights are in putting them together to create a systemic flow. As a result,
our Character 4 is the beta test of any organization. If I don’t know whether
something is going to work, I can take the idea to a Character 4, who will
visualize the project and then tell me _yes_, we can do that or _no_, that will not
work. The Character 4 may also say, _yes_, we could do that, but I’m not sure
that we should. If the Character 4 is not convinced that the gain or addition
will add value to the bigger picture, then it will always choose simplicity
and clarity over complexity.

When it comes to business practices, our Character 1 wants to make a
profit, our Character 2 will squirrel around with the idea and details, our
Character 3 wants it to be fun, and our Character 4 wants to serve the
greater good.
### **Character 4 at the Beach**

Character 4 can hear the sounds of the beach, the breaking waves and the
birds calling long before they get there. Character 4’s heart is so filled with
gratitude as they connect with the vast expansiveness of the ocean that ideas
of hope and possibility immediately replace any inklings of despair. In this
space, in this feeling of connection with something greater than oneself,
there is a sense of total abundance and total surrender to an all-knowing
awareness that everything is exactly as it should be.

We may be alone at the beach, but our Character 4 is never lonely. We
feel innately at home and completely present as we connect with all that is.
We watch the birds for longer than we realize as we get lost in their
musings. The essence of our being ebbs and flows in rhythm with the
waves, and we soar with the birds and exude contentment. As the sun
warms our skin, we close our eyes, raising our arms to the heavens in
appreciation for our life and all the life around us. We exhale.

Consumed by a feeling of grace, we know at our deepest core that we are
perfect, whole, and beautiful just the way we are. We make no comparisons
because we are completely here in the present, with a mind that is void of
another place or time. We are grateful that we have life, that we are life, and
that we share life. We feel humor in the playful dance of the pelicans, we
see meaning in the clouds, and we feel the beauty of the magic all around
us. We are aware of the tapestry of which we are a part as we move within
the flow of it all.

Character 4s at the beach smile easily and share direct eye contact with
those passing by. They are in motion energetically, even if their bodies are
not in action. They connect in amusement with the wild screams of children
at play and smile at the old geezer who is napping. If you open your soul to
their wavelength, you can feel their projection of love to everyone and
everything. And those dolphins we see today, the ones that bring everyone
so much joy, they are here in communion with our Character 4s.
### **A Snapshot of Our Character 4**

Aware: _I am connected to all that is. I am aware that I share the same_
_consciousness as everything around me and that I am in it, and it is in_

_me. We influence one another even though we cannot see it. We can_
_train ourselves to feel it and know it._

Expansive: _I am open to possibilities and value the big picture and_
_wholeness of my existence. I do not fear the absence of my ego-self_
_because I know that I am perfect, whole, and beautiful just the way I_
_am. We exist in the energy of the One._

Connection: _In the consciousness of the cosmic flow I embrace the_
_timeless, all-knowing part of myself that is connected to all that is. I_
_resonate in this space when I meditate or pray. Each one of us is a_
_neuron in the network of humanity, and we are intricately connected at_
_the molecular level as a part of the flow._

Accepting: _I can either accept life on its own terms and feel peace_
_knowing that everything is as it should be, or I can be attached to how_
_I want things to be and suffer when reality does not match my_
_preconceived vision._

Embraces Change: _I love and celebrate what is right here in front of_
_me, and then when this moment, this life, this love, this experience is_
_past, I am grateful that I had it at all. Life is a series of moment-by-_
_moment changes, and I embrace them all with an open heart and am_
_grateful for whatever comes next._

Authentic: _When I strip away the details of who I am in the external_
_world, when I step beyond the details of my Character 1 Persona,_
_Character 2 Shadow, and even my Character 3 Anima/Animus, I own_
_my power and step forward as my best self because this is the_
_consciousness of the Higher Power that flows through me._

Generous of Spirit: _I am a part of the whole. When I give to you, I am_
_giving to a part of myself. When I help you, I give assistance to us all._
_When I love you, I accept you as you are and we all thrive._

Clarity: _No longer distracted by the workings of the external world, I_
_am clear in our intention to love and be loved. Our number one job in_
_life is to love one another. Period._

Intention: _I set my intention and trust that everything is connected and_
_in flow. When I use the power of my heart and mind to manifest_
_something, I am using the power of myself to shift the arrangement of_
_the atoms and molecules in space, and I stay on course._

Vulnerability: _Stepping into life as the consciousness of the universe, I_
_can step into the nakedness of my Character 4 and stand strong in my_
_vulnerability. When I let you see who I am, I empower you to do the_

_same._



### **Getting to Know Your Character 4**

As with all the other characters, if you prefer to skip these
questions for now, feel free to continue reading, and come back for
this exploration when you can take some time to really explore this
part of yourself.

**1. Do you recognize your Character 4? Pause for a moment and**
**imagine yourself being this part of yourself.**

I became really familiar with this part of my being on the
morning of the stroke, when I shifted completely out of my leftbrain Characters 1 and 2. I felt as though there was nothing left of
me, the individual I had known, yet I was still tethered to this body
and this life. In the absence of everything that I had grown to be, I
felt pure bliss and grace in the all-knowing consciousness of the
universe. I knew that although I was not yet dead, I was as
disconnected as I could possibly be and still be counted among the
living.

**2. What does Character 4 feel like inside of your body? How**
**does this character hold your body, and what does your voice**
**sound like?**

In the absence of my left-brain characters, the consciousness of
my Character 4 was one of uncompromised peacefulness and
euphoria, and I purposely return to that state many times every day.
When I am embodying the consciousness of my Character 4, my
vision blurs, my senses perk up, the feeling in my chest expands, I
focus my attention in the present moment, the boundaries and edges
of my body slip out beyond my awareness, and the essence of my
being swells in a timelessness of intense grace and contentment.

When I speak, my voice drops into a lower register and I enunciate
clearly. The consciousness of my Character 4 is an amazingly
beautiful awareness that I know one day I will return to full-time,
and when I do it will be a true coming home.

**3. What if you don’t recognize this character inside you?**

If this Character 4 feels completely unfamiliar to you, and you not
only cannot recognize this part of yourself but it sounds completely
absurd, foreign, or perhaps even dangerous, rest assured that you are
not alone. Just as with our Character 3, it can feel very threatening
to our left-brain Characters 1 and 2 to step out beyond our sacred
individuality. However, offering techniques and tools that are
designed to help people find this place of deep inner peace is a
thriving multibillion-dollar industry, and if you choose to use tools
to help you get there, you have many options from which to pick.

Because we live in a society that is skewed toward the
hierarchical, materialistic values of our left brain, which focuses on
me, the individual, we are rewarded for what we do rather than for
who we are. Our right-brain Character 4 exists simply as life in a
peaceful and blissful state of feeling connected to all that is,
whereby life itself is the reward and gratitude is the underlying
feeling. It is impossible for our Character 1 to linearly rationalize or
think its way into our Character 4. Instead we must surrender to it,
and that can feel scary.

If your left-brain Characters 1 and 2 are really powerful, it may be
difficult for you to step into your Character 4, because in order to do
so you must feel safe. Not just physically safe, but safe emotionally
from the judgment and criticism of others who don’t value their own
Character 4. Many strong left-brain characters will negatively judge
the value of their own right brain, as they only believe in the reality
that is defined by their five senses. In addition, few things stir as
much fear, antagonism, or argument as the subjects of religion,
spirituality, and other intangible forms of belief. We have reasons
for believing what we believe, and any challenge to what we believe
is often interpreted as a personal endangerment.

Having said that, the dogma and stories associated with religions
are a function of our left-brain language centers, while our
experience of spirituality and our connection with a Higher Power
happen in our right brain. Regardless of which religion or practice
you might observe, the ultimate goal of prayer, mantra, or
meditation (at the neuroanatomical level) is to slip our
consciousness out of the confines of our left brain, where we
experience ourselves to be individuals, and into our right-brain
consciousness of our Character 4, where we experience a fluid
connection with our Infinite Being.

If you are a nonbeliever, either an atheist or agnostic, you are not
alone. Many of us don’t know what to believe, so we choose to not
believe in anything at all except perhaps the power of ourselves and
our five senses. Yet regardless of our level or subject of belief, when
it comes to our brain, tuning in to the consciousness of our
Character 4 can be very healing physically, emotionally, and
spiritually. When we choose to team up with the consciousness of
the universe for healing, amazing recovery can happen. Just look at
my brain. I can guarantee you that it was not the power of my leftbrain characters that brought them back online, it was the power of
the universe that worked with the consciousness of my Character 4
to help my cells heal.

If you still cannot identify with your Character 4, consider the
moments in your life when you have felt your heart expand or open.
For many, the sighting of a rainbow, or fireflies, or even catching a
glimpse of the shadow of a leprechaun as he dashes behind a tree at
dusk might bring a special thrill to your soul. If you are not aware of
ever having any of these feelings, there are tools you can use to help
yourself become more aware, more open, and more connected to the
all-knowing. If you are willing to expand your experience and
practice shifting your attention toward the elusive, it is possible for
you to train yourself to “become” the energy around you.

**4. Assuming you can identify your right-brain thinking**
**Character 4, how do you let this character express itself? How**

**much time do you spend in your Character 4, and what is that**
**like for you?**

This part of me is never far away as I vibrate in the hum of the
hummingbirds and coo at the trail of a shooting star, not forgetting
to silently make a wish . . . _why not?_ Character 4 is always running
just below the radar of the noise that is made by my other
characters, and this is my authentic self that is all-knowing, allloving, and connected to all that is.

This portion of my brain knows that we are perfect, whole, and
beautiful regardless of what is spiraling around me in this world or
what circumstances I find myself in. And a dead giveaway that I am
in my Character 4 is when I burst into song with Doris Day singing,
“Que Sera, Sera.” For you it might be “Don’t Worry, Be Happy”
with Bobby McFerrin or “Hakuna Matata” from _The Lion King_ .
Regardless of our age and era, these songs sing the promise of our
Character 4.

I step purposefully into my Character 4 when I exhale and allow
myself to be held by something that is greater than myself. God is in
the exhale. On the inhale are our expectations, our must-dos, our
performance, our self-reliance, our self-judgment, and our anxiety.
But when we let that go, when we surrender our attachment to what
we want as opposed to what is, our Character 4 steps out and
celebrates.

With practice, I shift my consciousness out of my normal focus,
pushing the constant noise of the world into the background, and
bring my attention to that which has no name. When I focus on my
breath, I immediately shift my awareness to the present moment.
When I think about my breath, I shift out of the past or the future.
Once in the present moment, I connect with my sense of gratitude
and allow my consciousness to devolve into the babble of the
babbling brook and empathically experience the laughter, tears, and
fears of others.

I let myself expand, weaving my energy between the blades of
wheat in that field over there, and I am in the movement of the grass
and trees over here. Matthew 6:28 says, “Consider the lilies of the
field, how they grow. They don’t toil, neither do they spin.” They

simply are, and they trust that is exactly what they are meant to be
and do.

Our Character 4 is our mystic self. It is our knowing that we are
not only held by nature but we are the crescendo of the insects as
they perform their symphonic cacophony. We are the sunbeams
when they explode as glory through the clouds, and it is my
Character 4 that reads the Morse code in the surface ripples when
they scatter across the water as a love note from our beloveds who
are now out and beyond.

**5. As you think about your right-brain thinking Character 4,**
**can you assign it an appropriate name?**

I lightheartedly and enthusiastically call my Character 4 “Queen
Toad.” I refer to her as a queen because, well, she is a queen. She is
the part of me that is regal and connected to the almighty. I call her
Toad because I am a goofball and I live on a lily pad on the water, a
boat named _BrainWaves_ where I spend five months a year. I have
learned that it is important for me to not take myself too seriously,
since I am both the center of the universe and simply a speck of
stardust. My Character 4 is more than my life. She is the part of me
that is omnipresent, and she feels like eternal Love.

**6. Who are some of the Character 4s who have influenced you**
**over the course of your life, in positive or negative ways? Was**
**your Character 4 emboldened by their Character 4 or repressed**
**by it?**

Following the stroke, I did not want to give up this awareness that
we are truly perfect, whole, and beautiful just the way we are. So I
made a vow to myself that I would only recover as much as I had to
recover for the rest of humanity to perceive me as normal. By
definition, the price I paid to be fully human again was losing my
complete connection with the Infinite Being. I made the decision to
recover, however, because there was no point in me having this

experience with stroke and God if I was not going to come back and
share it.

I am often asked if I can return to that space of my Character 4 at
will, and most of the time, instead of living here and visiting there, I
choose to live there and visit here. I am a Character 4, and I add the
skill sets and circuitry of my other Characters, 3, 2, and 1, to
function here in this world as a living being. Yet I remain clear that
Queen Toad is, in Jung’s language, my _Self_, and the rest of my
consciousnesses are simply the other characters I use to live this
human life.

I love meeting other Character 4s. They are truly the icing on this
cake of life. Put a couple of Character 4s together and watch the
sparks fly, the lightning strike, and the love explode. We are divine.

**7. Who in your life appreciates, cares for, identifies with, and**
**wants to hang out with your Character 4? What are those**
**relationships like?**

Some of the greatest words of wisdom I have ever heard came
from my very good friend Dr. Jerry Jesseph when he stated, “We, as
humanity, are confused and more confused.” I think it is safe to say
that those of us who are most confused are completely unaware of,
disrespectful of, or do not value our or anyone else’s Character 4.

Having said that, many of my closest friends live the life of a
strong Character 4. These friendships are all accepting, deeply
loving, supportive, nurturing, empathic, and kind. Character 4s share
a knowing when they meet, and they are some of the most gratifying
relationships one will ever find.

Who else likes this part of me? My fellow travelers who seek or
know this part of themselves. Those who exist in that realm dance
with me among the stars and know there is no separation in space
and time, so we never need to meet in this life. Yet when we do, it is
a sacred moment of connection and a shared moment of knowing.

**8. Who in your life does not get along with your Character 4?**

This part of me is pure love and sees the beauty in you no matter
your human circumstances. This is the part of a mother who
unconditionally loves her child as well as the children of others.
This is the part of ourselves that knows no stranger, and the part of
the Christ in us when we state, “Forgive them, Father, for they know
not what they do.” Character 4s love unconditionally, and at all
times.

Our Character 4 is a safe place because it is compassionate, kind,
and open. When someone else is having a bad day, my Character 4
can be kind and supportive and I can offer you a smile and an
appropriate touch, even when you are growling. A Character 2 in
distress can feel the strength, courage, and love when a Character 4
holds the space for them. Our Character 4 is the most powerful tool
we have to de-escalate either our or another’s pain.

**9. What kind of parent, partner, or friend is your Character 4?**

It is important for us to help our children develop a strong
Character 4 because this is a meaningful healing part of ourselves.
More than anything, healthy children want real connection with
others, and as their parents or friends we can model for them what it
means to have a healthy connection with our Higher Power. When
we recognize and value the thread of the One that is in everyone and
everything, we open our hearts and soften the edge of our judgment.
We have the ability to invite our children into an awareness of the
present moment, but more than likely they will probably lead you
into that conversation since we are born in the consciousness of our

Character 4.

One of the greatest gifts my mother ever gave me when I was a
child was to assure me that even in those moments when I upset her,
during those times when she may not have liked my behavior very
much, she always loved me. In addition, G. G. was always on a path
of growth, and throughout my life she let me grow and change and
did not limit me to who I was yesterday. She let me grow out of bad
behavior and did not hold me back.

When I graduated from college, I drove from Indiana to
California to become a guide on the American River. A fantastic
woman who was about my physical size volunteered to train me to
row the rapids. Ragina, who was a 13-year veteran guide at the time,
taught me that because of my size, I had to learn to row with my
brain rather than my back. The men could muscle their way out of
trouble, but smaller women could not. I grew up that summer on the
river by meeting the best part of myself, and the part of me that I
wanted to become. I met my Character 4.

When I returned home, my mother recognized that I was now a
different woman, and she never held me back to my smaller self. By
the time I had my stroke, my mother knew my Character 4, and she
completely trusted that her job was to set me up for success by
working with me to help me heal myself. My mother was my first
and greatest blessing, as she reared me twice.

By modeling for others how we find holiness and sacredness in
the simple things in nature, we help others see it more clearly. I had
a friend who would always pick worms up off the sidewalk and toss
them back into the yard when we went on walks. This was a great
practice, of course, except on those rainy days when thousands of
worms were unearthed. Then I found my left brain questioning the
wisdom of what we were doing, while my right brain thought maybe
it was time to go fishing.

**10. How kind is the relationship inside your head between your**
**characters? How does your Character 4 relate to your other**
**characters?**

Queen Toad does not just love everyone, she is love. She respects
and supports my Character 1, Helen, and celebrates her efforts to
help our life have order. On cue my Queen Toad zips right in to hold
and nurture my little Character 2, Abby, when she stumbles into fear
or pain. Queen Toad adores my Character 3, Pigpen, but has to
remind her often that although we are fine with death and dying, we
would appreciate Pigpen’s cooperation in helping us keep ourselves

alive. So far Pigpen has accommodated this request, and we come in
out of the thunderous lightning earlier than we used to.
