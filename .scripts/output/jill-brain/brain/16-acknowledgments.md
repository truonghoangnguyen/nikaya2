# ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

I am grateful for the wonderful network of people who are my tribe as
well as the entire TED community. You have loved and supported me
during the last few years as this material has transformed from a basic
understanding of the Four Characters into a true paradigm shift in how we
might think about psychology, consciousness, and how they relate to the
underlying anatomical structure of our brain. My heartfelt thanks to each of
you for all of your insights and openhearted support.

My deepest gratitude goes to Patti Lynn Polk. Thanks to you this is a
much more insightful and diverse book than I would have written on my
own. Your support, humor, and mastery of the material through the eyes of
a primary Character 1 has not only expanded my own understanding of the
Four Character dynamics, but you have helped stretch this conversation into
distant and important corners of our society that I would not have wandered
into on my own. Having you close by as both a sounding board and driving
force, your knowledge, experience, and rumble with your own Four
Characters (as well as with mine) has helped deepen my comprehension of
this material in valuable ways. I am profoundly grateful for your support,
love, time, energy, and overall commitment to helping me get this material
out of my brain, onto the page, and out into the world.

Anne Barthel, what a blessing it has been to have you as my Hay House
editor for this work. Amazingly, we managed to stay focused and engaged
even as the threat of Covid raged around us. Thank you for bringing just the
right amount of elegance and clarity to this project. Thank you for giving
me enough line to wander where I needed to roam, and just enough
tweaking to keep me on track. You did a great job wrangling both me and
this material, and our time together on Zoom has been a true joy.

Thank you, Michele Gingras, for bringing an eye for detail to the
manuscript in a way that helped me stay focused on the semantics, while
Helene Tivemark, you were a fantastic counterbalance that consistently
lifted me back into the big-picture perspective of this extremely diverse
material.

Ellen Stiefler, you totally rock as my agent/attorney and I look forward to
our next endeavor.

And finally, a special thanks to Reid Tracy, Patty Gift, and the entire
team at Hay House. Thank you for your patience, support, and overall
commitment to this project.
