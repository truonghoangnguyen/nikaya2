# THE BRAIN HUDDLE : YOUR POWER TOOL FOR PEACE

I love watching my Four Characters interact with one another as they
collectively live my life. From moment to moment, my Four Characters flit
in and out of dominance, as I really do independently embody all four of
them. I might be onstage giving an interview with Character 1, Helen,
teaching about the brain, and then in an instant Character 3, Pigpen, may
leap into my consciousness, take over the mic, and give an example using
my full body as a prop. Trust me: Helen would never have done it that way.
But now, instead of feeling shock or embarrassment, Helen has learned to
appreciate Pigpen, and she actually finds her as entertaining and brilliant as
the audience usually does. No one can come up with a better experiential
example to make that point that Helen is dryly teaching than Pigpen. The
more familiar you become with who is who inside of you, and the safer you
feel to exhibit each of them, the more whole-brained your life will become.

Having watched these Four Characters over the last few years, I have
seen that much of their behavior is relatively predictable. Helen likes to
hang out in the office or on the phone, while Queen Toad inevitably shows
up when I am on a nature walk. At least until something really fun happens,
and then Pigpen jumps in for an adrenaline rush. Each of our Four
Characters is somewhat stereotypical in their behavioral patterns, so the
more willing you are to observe yours in the wild, the more freedom you
(and they) will feel to live a whole-brain life.

Creating healthy relationships between our own Four Characters and the
Four Characters of others is our goal, especially if we would like for most
of those interactions to be positive and life giving. We do have the power to
pick and choose moment by moment which of our Four Characters we want
to be in the world, and sending them into a Brain Huddle is our key to our
next best action.

Let’s take a deeper dive into what it really means to take a Brain Huddle
as we gather together the voices of our Four Characters into a conscious

conversation about what is going on in any moment of our life. The Brain
Huddle is how we own our power by taking full responsibility for who and
how we present ourselves to the world, as well as how we choose to let the
world influence our thinking, emotions, feeling, and behavior.

When we run our lives on automatic, our Four Characters do whatever
they please without any real consideration for what we might actually
_choose_ to be doing instead. When our Four Characters gather together in a
Brain Huddle, just as in a sport, they each share their perspective and then
collectively choose our best next strategic play. Regardless of what is going
on outside of ourselves, we have the power to routinely come out of the
huddle with an appropriate and peaceful resolution.

By choosing to engage in a Brain Huddle, we set ourselves up for
success. If we really want to live our lives on purpose, let’s do it both
systematically and enthusiastically. Besides, once we call a Brain Huddle
and our Character 4 is engaged in the conversation, we are pretty much
guaranteed a loving outcome.



### **AN ANCHOR FOR THE HEART**

Just as with the other neural circuits in our brain, the more time we spend
practicing the Brain Huddle during the benign moments of our lives, the
stronger that circuitry becomes. Eventually our capacity to take a Brain
Huddle will run on automatic as a new habit. Imagine how different your
life will be when taking a Brain Huddle happens spontaneously throughout
the day, and it becomes so practiced that it is now your brain’s normal
response when you feel your emotional triggers are being pushed.

By far one of the greatest gifts of knowing my Four Characters, and
perfecting the ease with which they collectively enter into a Brain Huddle,
has been the realization that when I am feeling isolated and caught up in the
drama or emotional pain of my Character 2, that part of me is not alone.
When Abby is caught in the loop of feeling sadness or hopelessness, as
soon as we call a Brain Huddle, any feeling of isolation or despair
immediately dissipates. It is impossible for my right-brain Characters 3 and
4 to feel emotional loneliness, since they exist in the consciousness of the
collective whole.

However, during those moments when my Character 2, Abby, does feel
disconnected from both the rational brain of my Character 1 and the
collective consciousnesses of my right-brain Characters 3 and 4, she can
feel totally engulfed by a blinding fog of desperate emotion. When
experiencing this level of duress, just being aware that my Four Characters
are there and that I can call on them to hold a Brain Huddle has been an
anchor for my heart.

I can attest that nurturing the habituation of our Brain Huddle will lead to
a more whole-brain life. Every once in a great while, my Character 2, Abby,
experiences a debilitating anxiety attack. I never know ahead of time when
this is going to happen, but when it hits I feel like my brain is caught up in
an internal tornado of emotional reactivity. Having the option of shifting my
Four Characters into a Brain Huddle during those moments of need has
been a real lifesaver. Now, when my little Character 2’s emotional stress
circuitry even begins to rev up, I have a well-developed tool I can use to
save my peace of mind and calm my physiology.

If you, too, experience anxiety, you know how running that circuit has
the power to completely hijack your brain. Raw fear, anxiety, or even a
panic attack: each has the power to render us emotionally incapacitated,
feeling scared, desperate, vulnerable, and isolated. In those moments when I
feel completely enveloped by fear, I have found comfort in just knowing
that my other characters are still there. Even though I may have lost all
sense of them, I know that they are there watching, waiting for this
condensed energy surge to spread out to include them again so they can
engage again. I am sure that this tool of the Brain Huddle will help you,
during your time of need, in the same way that it has helped me survive
those dark moments of my soul.

If you don’t have any personal experience with severe anxiety or know
what it feels like, imagine all the energy in both your brain and body
suddenly flushing up into the group of cells making up your fight-flight
limbic circuitry. Your ears hear the roar of your blood as it sounds the alarm
of your heart pumping so loudly that you cannot think clearly or see
straight. You are thrown off balance as your entire body surges in what feels
like a violent physiological attack, rendering your Character 2 completely
flushed and overwhelmed with vulnerability. Remember how we are feeling
creatures who think, rather than thinking creatures who feel? When that
alarm of our emotional Character 2 is triggered in a full-force fear, anger, or
anxiety attack, just knowing our other characters are right there, ready for a
huddle, is a lifeline.

Another wonderful gift that the habit of the Brain Huddle has brought to
my life is that I have used this tool to train myself to easily identify and
embody each of my Four Characters at will. Now, when I am feeling even
the subtle invitation of my Character 2’s emotional reactivity tugging on my
consciousness, just knowing intellectually that my other characters are there
somewhere beyond the disconnect has allowed me to shift my focus away
from engaging with my Character 2 to simply observing her.

At an energetic level, as soon as I make this perceptual modification of
observing instead of engaging, the energy ball that is focused on stimulating
that emotional circuit begins to dissipate. As that tight focus of energy starts
to expand, it reinfiltrates the other parts of my brain, and within moments
my other characters can come back online and reenter my consciousness.
As they reappear and join Character 2 in a Brain Huddle, Character 1 steps
up to make sure we are physically safe in the immediate moment; Character

3 starts running imaginary scenarios about how we might strategize a
successful play; and Character 4 holds the space for us all—realizing that
even in the worst-case scenario, no matter what happens, we are okay.



### **OUR MIGHTY 50 TRILLION**

When I experienced the stroke and my left brain went off-line, I pictured
the 50 trillion cells making up my body and brain as beautiful little
creatures, each with a consciousness of their own. I listened to them. I
communed with them. I valued their efforts and shared with them how I
needed them to help me heal, and then I encouraged their efforts. I still give
credit to my brain cells for my recovery, and I continue to honor their
ongoing efforts to heal my wounds day by day.

I believe our cells have the power to heal us. Of course I value traditional
medicine, especially in the case of an emergency, but I do believe that a
little faith in our own power to heal creates a respectful and healthy team
spirit among our cells. As a collective of 50 trillion molecular geniuses, we
share the common consciousness of our Character 4. When we are willing
to tap into the combined power of the consciousness of the universe and our
cellular Character 4, we heal.

When my brain was devastated, the consciousness of my Character 4 was
all that remained. Once I decided that I was willing to _try_ to recover, which
meant that I was willing to endure the hard work and agony of trying to
focus my attention on things in the external world, my Character 4
embarked upon the journey by taking total responsibility to love and direct
all the healing efforts of all of my cells. As a collective consciousness, all
the cells of my brain and body worked together, and although I had no idea
in the long run how much I would heal or recover, my cells and I joined our
forces by collectively tapping into the conscious power of the universe.

Having recovered completely, I define and value each of my Four
Characters in a similar way. I see them as individuals, yet they are each a
part of my whole brain. I listen to their needs and call on them accordingly.
In many ways my Four Characters are like four children who value being
heard and seen, and getting to know each of them has made the little
moments of my life more predictable, for both me and those around me. My
Character 1, for example, is going to answer the phone on the first ring, but
if a friend calls and it goes straight to voice mail, they can rest assured that
my Character 3’s hands are busy.

Each of my Four Characters has merit, but as individuals they live by
their own set of values. Character 1 will dress well and arrive promptly at
an evening engagement, while Character 4 may choose to miss the event
altogether so she can stay out and commune with the sunset. Unless I am on
a strict schedule, I let my Four Characters lead my life. Am I feeling
refueled and ready to go out and share my energy as Helen, or do I prefer to
refuel and harmonize with nature as Queen Toad? Imagine the authentic
peace we would each bring to the world and one another if we completely
supported our own, as well as each other’s, Four Characters.



### **BENEFITS OF THE BRAIN HUDDLE**

In order for us to make good decisions, we need to know what our
options are. Before I thoroughly understood the Four Characters material, I
didn’t really know how to choose anything other than the black-and-white,
obvious alternatives. Although I usually feel good about the decisions I
make, every now and again I (probably Pigpen or Abby) make a decision
and then realize that if I had paused and implemented the Brain Huddle, I
would have chosen more wisely. I have found that the Brain Huddle soothes
my insecurities and gives rise to the voice of my most authentic self, which
is truly the combination of all of my voices.

There are several benefits to using this tool. First, the Brain Huddle
requires that I push the pause button, which is essentially the same as
running the 90 Second Rule that I described in Part I. Pausing for 90
seconds allows whatever chemicals are running through my bloodstream to
flood through and then completely flush out of me. Once I am clear-minded
again, and no longer feeling whatever I was feeling, I can bring all Four
Characters into the conversation and make better decisions.

Second, the Brain Huddle encourages all Four Characters to voice their
opinions. I run my brain like a democracy where every character gets an
equal vote—unless I am in danger. When each character feels heard, and
they listen to the opinions, wants, needs, and ideas of the other characters,
when they come to a consensus it is a unanimous decision.

As a result, the third clear benefit of the Brain Huddle is that any decision
I make using this tool is fortified by the support and consensus of all four of
my characters. When I own my power in this way, I am confident that I
have made the best choice. As a consequence, my most authentic life is
supported by this tool that promotes healthy whole-brain living.

But equally important, because I understand the Four Characters—who
they are and what they value—I get to see how the Four Characters are
playing out in the lives of those around me. My awareness of who you are
gives me a terrific advantage in how I might choose to interact with you. It
does not give me an advantage over you, but it certainly offers me insight
into how I might support and interact with you most effectively, since I

always want to have a more peaceful conversation, negotiation, and
resolution.

Trying to understand another person’s point of view sets us up for clear
communication. Loving people as they are, and not needing them to change
for us to feel safe, is also a gift. There are eight characters in every
relationship, each with individual needs, opinions, and desires. Recognizing
another person’s Four Characters and their needs can offer us a road map to
achieving peace and harmony during our communications. If I find that I
am experiencing conflict with you, for example, this tool helps me step
back and assess my response in a calm way, rather than reactively. I can
then evaluate the situation and show up more compassionately to listen to

you.

The Brain Huddle has proven to be a fantastic power tool for quick and
precise communication. For example, the other day I called a friend who is
a primary Character 4. When she answered the phone and we started
chatting, I said, “Wait, before we get to your four, tell me, how is your
one?” She proceeded to share with me her Character 1’s projects and how
those were going. Then I asked about her Character 2 and she shared with
me that her 2 was feeling particularly tender because of an encounter she
had the day before with a family member who was not well. Then she burst
out with what adventures her Character 3 was knee-deep in, and then we
touched home about her Character 4. Within five minutes my friend and I
had an amazingly meaningful and connecting catch-up about all eight of our
characters. It was fun, clarifying, and deeply satisfying. We were both
grateful for the insights of the Four Characters language.

Using the Brain Huddle for personal reflection can help us determine
what changes we might like to make in who and how we present ourselves
to be, as well as in how we choose to connect with others. I realized that
every time I drove over to visit with my mom, G. G., it was essential that I
show up as my Character 3 rather than as my Character 1. G. G. wanted to
set the schedule and make the decisions about what we did, so if I wanted to
keep the peace, on the road over to her place I would consciously quiet
Helen and wire up Pigpen. This was the magical combination that worked
for our relationship. I’m sure you have some of those relationships in your
life too. Knowing how to navigate our relationships in this way is part of
how we can choose to love one another.

The overall most important reason why I use the Brain Huddle on a
regular basis, however, is because it is a road map to my best self. This tool
allows my two left-brain ego-selves to have a voice and be heard, but in the
end, the voice I really want to bring into the conversation is the voice of my
unconditionally loving Character 4. When I enter into a Brain Huddle, I
know that I won’t come out of it with a decision until all Four Characters
have weighed in. Predictably, I know that as soon as my Character 4, Queen
Toad, shows up and participates, my Characters 1, 2, and 3 can relax and I
will choose to take my best and most loving steps forward.



### **HOW IT WORKS: THE CONVERSATION** **INSIDE YOUR HEAD**

The action of taking a Brain Huddle can serve as a balm for your whole
being. As I noted in Chapter 3, the process of consciously and deliberately
bringing all Four Characters into the conversation is both powerful and
empowering. I have also found it to be grounding and deeply comforting. I
like to think of it as a power tool for peace.

Here, I will outline the steps that make up a successful Brain Huddle and
describe in detail the power that each of the stages brings us. As we saw
earlier, the steps of the Brain Huddle spell out the acronym B-R-A-I-N,
giving us an easy reminder, even during our most debilitating bouts of fear
or anxiety. I can rely on this tool to help me recalibrate my brain when I am
feeling emotionally reactive, overwhelmed, or vulnerable. I hope you find
this tool to be as effective as I have.
### **B = BREATHE**

**BREATH** is how I hit the pause button and bring my mind to the present

moment.

At a neuroanatomical level, the power of our human brain is not in the
way our cells excite one another but in the way they inhibit one another. It
is really easy to get all cranked up, excited, and out of control, but it takes
maturity to not be reactive and to stop running our circuits on automatic.
Our willingness to push the pause button is how we engage the power of the
Brain Huddle.

The best way I know how to create a physiological pause is to bring my
**BREATH** .
attention to the present moment and focus on my body and my
Once my awareness is grounded in the right here, right now, I can sidestep
the habituated patterns of my thinking and emotional circuitry that have
been running on automatic. It does not matter which of the Four Characters

I have been embodying. When I pause and focus on my **BREATH**, I break
the circuit and create space for something new.

By choosing to focus on my **BREATH**, I am pushing the pause button
between the stimuli that are streaming in through my sensory systems and
my automatic responses to that stimulation, be they thoughts, emotions, or
actions. Just as there is a space between the neurons making up a circuit, I
have the power to stop cellular communication instantly. I do not have to
run outdated patterned responses that are wired in my brain from the past. I
can make new choices and consciously build new circuitry. Practice does
make perfect when it comes to brain circuitry, because every time we run a
circuit by choice, it becomes stronger.

As I focus on my **BREATH**, I connect safely and intimately with my
whole being. I trust my **BREATH** implicitly, as it has always been with me
like a comforting teddy bear, and it will stay with me for as long as I am
alive. To the consciousness of my Character 4, the universe is the womb
within which I am breathing, and I perceive that I am being breathed by the
omnipotent consciousness of the eternal flow. The universe is breathing me,
and I have life because it is there supporting my life. By thinking about my
breath in this way, I feel my consciousness expand, and this is particularly
helpful when I am experiencing a powerful bout of hostility or anxiety.

If I have been running my Character 1 skill set before jumping into a
Brain Huddle, after a brief **BREATH** and pause I may choose to step right
back into that consciousness, now feeling a little more relaxed. This part of
my brain is masterful at running the details of my life, so stepping in and
out of her with ease, and periodically taking a refreshing break, can be
healing for my overall physical and mental health. It is well known that
getting some movement, catching a power nap, or indulging in a distraction
that breaks the continuity of a left-brain task encourages the brain at a
neurological level to disrupt its stress circuitry, hit a reset, feel refreshed,
and be open to new insights and possibilities. This is particularly effective
when the left brain is struggling to solve a problem or write an intelligible
paragraph.

When I focus on my **BREATH** and purposely bring my awareness of my
physical body to the forefront of my mind, I tend to shift completely into
my Character 4, whereby I feel a vast sense of gratitude that I am this
miraculous being of life. At this level of awareness, I use my **BREATH** to
consciously neuro-regulate my autonomic nervous system. Through the

eyes of an anatomist, I can’t help but recognize the similarity between the
semipermeable membrane in my lungs that filters oxygen out of the air and
the semipermeable membrane of that single cell that is attracted toward
some things and repelled by others. There is a very fine line between this
life and the absence of it. Breath is the key.
### **R = RECOGNIZE**

**RECOGNIZE** which of the Four Characters are in the room.
Right here, right now, I have the ability to pause and breathe deeply,
focus my mind on what it feels like to be me, and then **RECOGNIZE**
which character circuitry I have been running and which characters of other
people are in the room. I may also **RECOGNIZE** that all four of my
characters are stammering for the microphone because they all have
something important to contribute.

I **RECOGNIZE** that I am in my Character 1 when I feel like I am
focused on details and concentrating on something, gathering information,
organizing that information, or working methodically toward an end goal.
As a Character 1, I am highly disciplined and enjoy being the boss. I thrive
when allowed to be in control of myself, a situation, or others. There is a
right and wrong way of doing things, so I am particularly good at
establishing efficient systems and then perfecting the performance of those
systems as time goes along. I am known to be precise, efficient, and
competent, so I feel a personal sense of satisfaction when I do things well.

As a Character 1, I think linearly, and when I have a project to complete
that is made up of many steps, I start at the logical beginning. I am a natural
taskmaster, so fixing problems suits me well. It is easy for me to
**RECOGNIZE** when I am running the _get on it and get it done_ circuitry of
my Character 1, and it is easy for me to **RECOGNIZE** this character in
others.

But if I am feeling hurt, lonely, abandoned, or emotionally charged about
something that has happened in the past, or an old hostility or injustice
keeps rattling around in my brain, it is simple for me to **RECOGNIZE** that
my Character 2 has been triggered. Anytime I am on fire with anxiety about
the future, or totally freaking out that I am not being seen, heard, or treated
fairly based on my old wounds, it is easy for me to **RECOGNIZE** that my

Character 2 has flared right up in an attempt to not only protect me but help
me get my needs met.

Fortunately I can **RECOGNIZE** almost the instant my Character 2 has
possessed my body and consciousness. Character 2 feels heavy, burdened,
or desperate, just as though doomsday has perilously arrived. Character 2
feels prickly in my body and tense in my throat, and the left half of my jaw
aches with pain. I become highly focused as my head feels like it is in a
deep cloud, and I feel sequestered from my other characters. Shame, guilt,
embarrassment, and the impetus to blame someone else for something that
has happened are old patterned responses that my Character 2 has perfected
in her attempts to fend off threats. It is critical that we each train ourselves
to immediately **RECOGNIZE** when our Character 2 has come online so
we can take full responsibility for managing and disarming its pain and
potential wrath before we express them in the world and sabotage our
relationships or lives.

I de-escalate the hostility of my Character 2 by **RECOGNIZING** that it
has been triggered, and then I immediately push the pause button. I
purposefully calm this character down before I say or do things that I might
later regret. Feeling shame or guilt about my Character 2’s wiring only
vexes my attempts to heal her, so when she is triggered, I practice the 90
Second Rule. It works like a timeout, or a count-to-ten, giving me a
moment to reset. Under extreme duress my Character 2 **RECOGNIZES**
she has been hijacked, and she brings the word B-R-A-I-N into her mind to
help her remember she is not alone.

In contrast, I **RECOGNIZE** that I am in my ebullient Character 3 when I
am feeling really animated, a bit jittery, or just bouncing out of my skin
with exuberance. Nothing floods through me like a flush of adrenaline, and
I can instantly **RECOGNIZE** this explosion of energy. When I feel present,
attentive to the moment, and wanting to play or connect with others, I
**RECOGNIZE** that I am in my Character 3. Also, when I am feeling
artistically or musically creative or curious, my Character 3 is center stage.

But Character 3 is not always happy, in that sometimes the emotional
surge of an immediate danger can trigger a right-brain alert response that is
easily **RECOGNIZABLE** as well as easily distinguished from my
Character 2 threat response. While my Character 2 feels heavy, drained, or
distraught when emotionally triggered, Character 3 feels like an energy
surge of blood rushing instantaneously into my limbs, preparing me for a

fight-or-flight response. Feeling like I want to jump out of my skin, I have
an odd sense of acceleration, as a flood of prickly heat flushes up my spine
and explodes like a volcanic river as a purge of sweat.

Although this triggering of my Character 3 can be startling and
uncomfortable for anyone nearby, the pain I feel internally is equally
alarming to me. Because I understand that this reactivity is wired in my
brain to save my life, once I feel the floodgate open and I **RECOGNIZE** it
for what it is, I do my best to step back and let it dissipate in private. Our
prisons are filled with first-time offenders whose Character 3 had a
momentary full-blown aggressive attack. Imagine how having had the
ability to call their Four Characters into a Brain Huddle could have saved
them from acting out and doing something they would later regret.

Character 4, in all of its glory, is always a delight and easy for me to
**RECOGNIZE** and enjoy. When I am feeling total contentment, an open
expansiveness in my chest, and a deep appreciation for whatever life has
brought my way, it is simple for me to **RECOGNIZE** that my Character 4
is the circuitry that I am running. In this mindset, my heart feels calm and I
am filled with a deep sense of gratitude for everything just as it is, even if
another part of me might wish something were different. I can
**RECOGNIZE** that Character 4 is always present and available for me to
tune in to, even if I can’t sense her when my Character 2 has
commandeered my focus.

When I **RECOGNIZE** the character that I am being, no matter which
one it is, I validate that character and my link to its awareness becomes
stronger. When I pay attention and care enough to know which character I
am embodying, I connect with it, and simply by doing so I connect with
myself. When I **RECOGNIZE** the value of my Four Characters, I don’t
need anyone outside of me to validate me. Instead, I am clear about who my
Four Characters are, and I know that I am enough. I know that I am not
only worthy of being loved but that I am love.

The same is true for how I connect with you. Only when I care enough to
pay attention to **RECOGNIZE** which of the Four Characters you are
inhabiting at any moment can I authentically connect with you. If I want to
fully see you and validate you, I must first **RECOGNIZE** which character
you have brought into our encounter. If you come in as a Character 1, you
would probably rather receive a _you did a good job_ affirmation than the _you_
_light up the world_ type of praise I might give your Character 4.

And if you come in as your Character 2, perhaps especially if you come
in as your Character 2, I need to **RECOGNIZE** that, accept that you are in
pain, and shift my affect to match your energy, welcome you, support your
need to be heard, and love on you. I need to **RECOGNIZE** if your pain is
hurt or sadness so I can show up as my Character 4 to soothe you. Or if
your pain is fear or anxiety, maybe my Character 1 needs to come out to
protect you. If you come in as your Character 2 and I dismiss your need, I
miss a golden opportunity to sincerely connect with one of the most tender
and vulnerable parts of who you are. Our willingness to **RECOGNIZE**
which characters are in the room is our pathway to genuine connection and
in-to-me-see (intimacy).
### **A = APPRECIATE**

**APPRECIATE** whichever character is present and **APPRECIATE** the
reality that all Four Characters are always around, whether we are aware of
their presence or not.

When I **APPRECIATE** the innate value of whichever character I am
exhibiting in any moment, beyond merely recognizing that character, I am
intentionally honoring and respecting the skill set of that part of me. When
we focus on, validate, and **APPRECIATE** the strengths of each of our Four
Characters, we are empowering our ability to engage with them. Nothing is
more important than our respect for ourselves, or more connecting with
others than our respect and **APPRECIATION** for the gifts that each of
their Four Characters bring to the table.

In addition, during my worst bouts of anxiety, fear, or anger, when the
alarm circuit of my Character 2 is triggered and I feel cut off from my other
characters, just being able to **APPRECIATE** the fact that they are there
reassures me that I am fine. Even in those moments of despair and
hopelessness, I know my other characters will come back online as soon as
the energy dissipates back into those parts of my brain.

When I **APPRECIATE** that my Character 2 can be a bit awkward (loud,
attacking, inappropriate) in how she sounds my alarm, and I remember that
she behaves in this way because she loves me and is trying to protect me
and does not know a better way, it makes it a lot easier for me to honor how

courageous she is in the face of those perceived threats. Keeping close tabs
on her and **APPRECIATING** her intention and efforts help her feel safe.

When I move into the Brain Huddle and **APPRECIATE** each of my
characters individually, I **APPRECIATE** that my Character 1 wants to be
the authority and take control of the details of my world so I can live my
best life and know that she has me under her wing. She is excellent at what
she does, and I am grateful that she is a master of many things, including
the management of space, events, and people and their schedules.

My Character 2 is a faithful servant that shows up to protect me, and I
**APPRECIATE** her willingness to play that role so I can be safe and
flourish. When I **APPRECIATE** whatever emotion I am experiencing, it
brings richness to my life, and I am grateful that my Character 2 has been
willing to step out of the consciousness of the present moment so I can
experience the linearity of a past, present, and future. When I
**APPRECIATE** and value myself, I operate from a position of power.
When I deny my emotions, I fuel my discontent and internal struggle.

Character 3 embraces the thrill of my existence, and I **APPRECIATE**
that I have the ability to savor every fleeting moment and experience. On
top of that, I so value and **APPRECIATE** her open heart, and her eagerness
to play and genuinely connect with you.

My Character 4 rests without judgment in the grace of all that is. And I
**APPRECIATE** the 50 trillion molecular geniuses that work seamlessly
together so that not only do I have the ability to exist at all but you are here
for me to share with.

And I **APPRECIATE** all of your characters for the same reasons I
**APPRECIATE** all four of mine. It is our **APPRECIATION** for one
another that seals our connection. Like plugging our phone into the charger,
we can recognize one another, but if we don’t line up those little teeth to
make a solid connection, the energy will not flow from the wall socket into
the phone. You may recognize what character I am displaying, but when
you sincerely **APPRECIATE** its value and offer gratitude for its existence,
that is when we align with one another and manifest a lasting and
meaningful connection.
### **I = INQUIRE**

**INQUIRE** within and invite all Four Characters into the huddle.
Once I have pushed the pause button and become aware of my BREATH,
and then RECOGNIZED which of my Four Characters I have been
embodying, as well as RECOGNIZED which characters of others are
around, I have then offered APPRECIATION up for all of our characters.
At this point in the Brain Huddle, it is time for us as a collective of all Four
Characters to **INQUIRE** about what our best next move might be. We
**INQUIRE** when we are curious, and we are curious when we care. Using
the tool of the Brain Huddle, our Four Characters come together to voice
their opinions. We **INQUIRE** by first observing ourselves, second by
observing those around us, third by observing ourselves in response to those
around us, and fourth by observing how others are responding to us.

Say, for example, I walk into a room where a couple has been arguing as
two Character 2s. In that moment it would be appropriate for my Four
Characters to privately take a Brain Huddle to **INQUIRE** about what we
might consciously choose to do next. Since my Character 4 has already
ascertained the tension in the air, it might be good for my Character 3 to
hop in with some comic relief. However, if I don’t know these folks very
well, that strategy might fall flat. Choosing to bring my Character 1 on
board instead, so she can address the logistics and perhaps offer some
assistance if needed, might prove to be the best plan.

Not long ago, I was driving down the highway when the car in front of
me swerved and accidently hit a rabbit. As I approached I saw the animal
was clearly hurt but had not yet crossed the rainbow bridge. In that moment
I felt myself flood with an array of intense emotions, and I instinctively
invited my Four Characters into a Brain Huddle. During the **INQUIRY**,
they all had something to share. Little Abby had been instantly flooded with
enormous grief and reactively didn’t know what to do other than freak out.
Character 1, Helen, tried to determine if she should turn around to try to
help the animal or just keep going forward because there was an impatient
driver tailgating us. Pigpen wondered, _Huh, I don’t have a rabbit in my_
_mammalian brain collection_, while Queen Toad closed the **INQUIRY** by
choosing to hold the rabbit in a tenderhearted place from afar. All four of
my characters agreed to sit in quiet prayer, sending love to the creature
whatever its fate was.

If I am showing up as a Character 1 most of the time, it is not my nature
to choose to **INQUIRE** very often. Since our Character 1 is busy getting

the job done rather than exploring new possibilities, encouraging our
Character 1 to pause, shift into huddle mode, and then **INQUIRE** with the
others about what their opinions are is generally a helpful idea. When I do
**INQUIRE**, I am curious about how I am showing up, and I am curious
about who you are showing up to be as well. When we **INQUIRE** and are
being curious, we are engaging our right-brain Characters 3 and 4, and
these two characters can provide a refreshing perspective and neurological

reset.

**INQUIRY** is a great gift that we offer others, as it lets them know we are
available for a real connection. When we **INQUIRE** into both ourselves
and others, we accept, encourage, and invite everyone’s Four Characters to
participate in both the huddle and in choosing the next strategic move in the
game of life. This is particularly important when someone is in discomfort
or feeling the need to be right, as it invites everyone’s Four Characters to
participate with their unique insights. By taking responsibility for the
character I embody, I take responsibility for the energy I bring into a room.
### **N = NAVIGATE**

**NAVIGATE** our new reality with all Four Characters bringing their best

game.

For the Brain Huddle we began by consciously choosing to pause and
take a deep BREATH so we could bring ourselves to the forefront of our
mind in the present moment. Then we RECOGNIZED which character we
were exhibiting and expressed APPRECIATION for that specific skill set,
as well as appreciation for the awareness that all the other characters were
available for action. Next, all four of our characters joined together in the
Brain Huddle for an intensive INQUIRY about current circumstances, and
now it is time for our Four Characters to **NAVIGATE** our new reality as a

team.

Life is a moving target, with change as the only constant. The Brain
Huddle allows us to consciously shift away from our natural tendency to
react on automatic and purposely take responsibility for who and how we
want to be. Our circumstances are constantly changing, so choosing a static
response to a moving target will inevitably result in failure.

If we are to be successful, our Four Characters need to be available to
**NAVIGATE** our life and be flexible with whatever characters show up in
others. Say, for example, I just bought a shirt that had a stain on it that I did
not realize was there until I stepped out of the store and into the parking lot.
In that moment all four of my characters had an opinion, of course. Abby
felt disgruntled and put out, Helen needed to go right back into the store and
replace it immediately, Pigpen was happy to look at all the sparkly stuff
some more, and Queen Toad knew we had plenty of time so all was well.

During INQUIRY, my Four Characters decided that this was a perfect
task for Helen, so back into the store we went with Helen in the lead to
exchange the item for an identical one. At the customer support desk, we
could have encountered any of the Four Characters. A Character 1 clerk
might choose to escort me back to the shirts and help me find a
replacement, because they value me as a customer and want me happy. A
Character 2 might be a stickler for the rules and insist that I fill out the
paperwork for a return. Then I would have to go find a new shirt and wait in
line again to buy it. A Character 3 or 4 customer service clerk would
probably just wave me through so I could replace the item without any
hassle. Each of my Four Characters would **NAVIGATE**, with flexibility,
whatever character we encountered. If it turned out that we were working
with a Character 2, Helen would purposely keep Abby at bay and breathe
deeply, while Queen Toad might choose to say something complimentary
and kind to the person. We **NAVIGATE** who we are moment by moment,
depending on who we encounter.

We really do have the power to choose who and how we want to be in the
world, and we have so much more power over what is going on inside of
our brains than we have ever been taught. In his wonderful book _Getting to_
_Yes with Yourself_, my good friend Bill Ury shares the strategy of “going to
the balcony” when it is time to undertake, or **NAVIGATE**, an intense
negotiation. In the language of the Four Characters, Bill is encouraging
people to step into the consciousness of their Character 4 so they can bring
their big-picture perspective into the conversation. When we are willing to
explore what both sides have in common, and find our way past our
emotion, we can **NAVIGATE** our way into an outcome that feels like
success for both parties.

### **The Reset**

As we have explored, the Brain Huddle can be a fantastic tool for our
Four Characters to use on a regular basis when we are not in distress. I use
this tool many times a day just to get a clue about how I am showing up in
my life. By strengthening this circuitry and using this tool regularly, I know
that I can call on any of my Four Characters at any time. And I have to
admit, it’s fun watching my characters in the wild.

In addition, I have shared how I have used the Brain Huddle tool during
extreme duress, and how it has provided me with a lifeline when I needed it
the most. The B-R-A-I-N acronym itself reminds me that all of my
characters are always available, even when I can’t feel them. It anchors my
knowing that I am not alone, and that I am okay.

The Brain Huddle is also a powerful tool for resetting our connection
with another person in a moment of conflict or distress. It is important to
remember that inside every relationship or encounter there are eight of us
vying for the microphone. When all eight of our characters are trying to get
along, it is not unusual for one of our Character 2s to be triggered
unexpectedly. And once our emotional Character 2 has been triggered,
although it may take only 90 seconds for that emotion to flush through and
pass out of us, if we reengage too soon, when we are still feeling
vulnerable, we may end up being retriggered.

When we fight with another person, it is important to recognize that the
energy in the space between us has become just as charged as we are.
Turning off neuronal circuits is somewhat similar to turning off electrical
circuits, in that it takes a little bit of time for the energy to completely
dissipate and neutralize. It is important that our Four Characters take some
time to completely reset before entering back into a tense or toxic setting.

Thus, creating physical space between us and the other person is
generally a really good idea, even if it just means stepping into another
room. Next, if both parties are aware of their Four Characters, and each is
willing to take a Brain Huddle, this is a good first step to renewing a
positive connection. If even only one person is willing to step out of their
Character 2 and engage in a Brain Huddle, there is hope for a reconnection.
However, I will repeat: two Character 2s will never find resolution until one
of them is willing to step out of that character and embody one of their
other characters.

Whether you find yourself challenged in an encounter with another
person or emotionally triggered and navigating a stressful situation on your
own, the Brain Huddle offers a powerful opportunity for a reset. Besides
proving to be a fantastic tool for normal healthy living, the B-R-A-I-N
acronym has the power to beam like a neon light through the blinding fog
of a devastating bout of negative emotion. If you ever need to rescue
yourself from a desperate situation, let this be an anchor.



### **COMING UP NEXT: THE FOUR** **CHARACTERS IN THE WILD**

Now that we have examined each of the Four Characters in detail, as well
as the benefits of bringing them together in the Brain Huddle as a tool for
both crisis management and daily living, let’s take a closer look at the Four
Characters in different areas of real life. I like to call this “the Four

Characters in the wild.”

In Chapter 9 we will delve into the intimate relationship between our
Four Characters and how they relate to and take care of our body, in both
wellness and in illness. Unquestionably our most important relationship is
the one between our brain and body, and all of the Four Characters are quite
predictable in how they look at, attend to, and nurture this vital relationship.

In Chapter 10 we will consider the Four Characters and how they interact
in romantic relationship with the Four Characters of a potential partner. Our
whole world revolves around how we connect with others and how they
connect with us. The Four Characters have different values, and they live
our lives and establish our relationships with one another based upon those
values. In this chapter we will take a peek at who might be attracted to
whom, which combinations are likely to work, and some of the dynamics
we can predict based on what we know about the Four Characters. You will
probably recognize some of your own patterns, and hopefully gain a little
insight into your own relationships.

Chapter 11 views the Four Characters from a completely different
perspective. It is one thing for us to approach this material through the filter
of a healthy brain, but in this chapter we will talk about what is going on in
the brain that is managing alcoholism, addiction, or recovery. The Four
Characters material up to this point has been all about helping us create
healthy relationships within our own brain, as well as between our brain and
others, through the creation of healthy connections. Because drugs and
alcohol cause brain cells to disconnect rather than connect with one another,
they not only interfere with the operation and function of our own brain, but

they also create disconnection in our interpersonal relationships and have
the power to derail them.

In Chapter 11 we will explore how understanding the Four Characters
might help a person create the conditions necessary to successfully navigate
a recovery program such as the Twelve Step Program of Alcoholics
Anonymous (AA). Thanks to our brain’s neuroplasticity and neurogenesis,
we have the ability to heal and recover from all sorts of trauma, including
drug and alcohol abuse. As we dig more deeply into what is going on in the
brain for a successful recovery at the level of the Four Characters, we will
discuss how the AA Twelve Step Program, the Brain Huddle, and the
Hero’s Journey are in many ways the same journey toward healing.

Finally, in Chapter 12 we will expand our vision of the brain and our
Four Characters into the bigger picture of humanity. We will take a look at
the evolution of our Four Characters over the last hundred years in the U.S.
through the filter of our generational differences. In addition, we will look
closely at the influence technology has had on both our brain and the
expression of our Four Characters. We will walk away with a better
understanding of how we are neurologically different from our children,
especially at the level of our Four Characters.

As you read through the following chapters, regardless of the specific
subject, I think you will find the behavior of each of the Four Characters to
be both consistent and predictable. In addition, you will probably recognize
your own attitudes and behaviors quite easily. It is important to note that
you may readily identify with multiple of your characters under different
circumstances. Although we each may have a dominant character, we really
do tend to exhibit all Four Characters in different situations. Considering
there is no right or wrong, I am hoping what you learn about yourself will
be fun for you.

Please remember that although you may recognize some of your
tendencies from past behavior, you are not bound to your old programming.
Many of us have been running on automatic for such a long time that our
health and well-being may have suffered. Now that you know you have the
power to choose, and you know what your Four Characters options are and
how to bring them together in a Brain Huddle, you might choose to make
different decisions. For example, if you have traditionally managed an
illness with your Character 2, you may now choose to let your Character 1
take over that role. Or if you have young children and tend to parent with

your Character 1, you might try shaking things up a bit and show up doing a
Character 1 task as a fun-loving Character 3 instead.

As I mentioned early on, we have more power over what is going on
inside of our brain than we were ever taught. History is filled with examples
of remarkable people who have not only endured and survived horrible
treatment and events but have come out of it emotionally and cognitively
empowered. Following a beating for civil disobedience, Mahatma Gandhi is
said to have professed, “Nobody can hurt me without my permission.”
Essentially, he was declaring the realm of his brain as his own domain. This
is the ultimate power of our Four Characters.
