# CHARACTER 1 LEFT BRAIN THINKING

Our brain’s left hemisphere is the primary tool we use to interact with the
external world. On the morning of the stroke, those cells making up the
network of my Character 1 left thinking brain were swimming in a pool of
blood that rendered them completely nonfunctional. Besides losing a group
of skill sets that were dependent on those brain cells to function, as I
mentioned earlier, when my left thinking network went off-line, a specific
part of my personality, a character that I had known for decades as my egoself, also disappeared.

When my Character 1 left thinking cellular network was incapacitated, I
could no longer identify the physical boundaries of where I began and
where I ended. I have to say that even as a neuroanatomist, I had never been
taught that there was a group of cells in my brain that did that. With those
cells off-line, I perceived myself to be a gigantic ball of energy that blended
fluidly with the rest of the energy in the universe. I felt so vast that I
believed I would never be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back
inside this tiny little body. As you might imagine, one part of me found this
shift in my awareness amazingly insightful and exciting, while my
Character 1 would have judged this loss of my _self_ to be degrading—if it
had remained functional enough to ponder the idea.

In addition to not being able to perceive the boundaries of where I began
and ended, my left brain could no longer ascertain the edges or boundaries
between anything else in the external world. As a result, I experienced
myself as fluid, in flow with the energy of everything en masse around me.
This shift in perception was possible because our left brain is designed to
perceive differences and separation at the level of things, rather than at the
subatomic level of the particles that make up those things. The latter is the
realm of what we call our unconscious mind, the territory of our right brain.



### **THE FOREST AND THE TREES**

On the afternoon of the stroke, I learned that the energetic flow of all
mass moves so slowly that it cannot be detected by our left brain. As long
as the left brain is focused at the level of solid things and is preoccupied
with detecting the details that allow us to differentiate one thing from
another thing, it cannot focus on the component pixels that make up those
things. In other words, our left brain focuses on the details that distinguish
one thing from another thing (trees), while our right brain focuses on the
pixels that have no distinguishing characteristics and move as one (forest),
as a part of the cosmic flow.

Because our two hemispheres process information in these two opposite
ways, our overall perception of the world is a blended combination of the
big picture (right brain) and the details (left brain). Like an eagle soaring
from a great height, it can perceive the enormous landscape below and still
focus on that vulnerable (and delicious-looking) prairie dog half a mile

away.

When my left brain went off-line and I could no longer detect
information at the level of things, to use the example of the eagle, I lost the
ability to distinguish the prairie dog from the landscape. I could only
perceive the pixelated atoms that make up space and exist at the level of the
cosmic flow. Consequently, when I stood in the shower on the morning of
the stroke, I could not distinguish the pixels making up my arm from those
composing the wall. All I could detect was my energy, blended with the
energy making up the space around me. My perception of myself bypassed
all boundaries, and I literally became as big as the universe.

When the language centers in the Character 1 left thinking part of my
brain fell silent, I lost all ability to communicate with others and even with
myself. Not only could I not speak or understand when others spoke to me,
but I could not distinguish letters or numbers as symbols that had meaning.
Pre-stroke, I had known who I was because there had been a group of cells
in my left brain that manufactured my identity as Jill Bolte Taylor. These
cells that made up my left-brain ego-center knew who I was, where I lived,
and tons of other details like what my favorite color was. These ego-center

cells had worked day in and day out to keep me abreast of all the tidbits,
details, memories, and likes and dislikes that had made up my identity. I,
Jill Bolte Taylor, existed because the cells in my left-brain ego-center told
me I existed.

When those cells of my left-brain ego-center shut down, and I shifted
into the oblivion of my right brain, I had no idea who I was and I could not
recall anything about my pre-stroke life. It was not as though I was missing
a memory that I simply could not put my finger on; it was more like that
memory (and I myself) had never existed at all. I know it’s a bit
disconcerting to think that who we are is completely manufactured by a
small group of cells in our left brain, and that we can lose ourselves at any
moment, but that is exactly how fragile our ego identities are.



### **LOSING AND REGAINING MY CHARACTER** **1**

In addition to losing all of those very important abilities and functions,
when my left brain went off-line I also lost the characters of my left
thinking and left emotional cellular networks. Like a stove with the two left
burners turned off, most of the cells in my left brain were still physically
there, but they were traumatized and could not function. Without the
linearity of time that my left-brain cells had so effectively engineered, all I
had was the vastness of the present moment. Unlike the hero in the Hero’s
Journey who willingly chose to set down the sword of his left-brain ego,
mine was involuntarily stripped away. As I unwittingly shifted into the
unconscious realm of my right brain, in the absence of a functional left
brain I was rendered as inept as an infant.

The loveliest part of losing my left-brain emotional Character 2, which
we will talk about in the next chapter, was the complete absence of anger
and fear. Without any of the left-brain memories from my past
overshadowing the present-moment experience of my right brain, I shifted
into a state of blissful euphoria. Of course, as tantalizing as this experience
was, the absence of my left-brain Character 1 rendered me literally halfwitted, and I could not function in the real world. (Mind you, while I was in
that condition of ineptitude, I did not feel any alarm about it.)

Over the course of eight years of recovery, as the circuits in my left brain
regained their functions and became strong again, my left-brain characters
eventually recovered and came back online. My Left Thinking Character 1,
as I mentioned earlier, wanted to take over and be the boss inside my head
again. But although she had been both an effective and brilliant part of my
pre-stroke life and I had achieved a high level of success under her
leadership, I was no longer motivated by the external factors of money and
prestige that she valued.

Although I knew I would have to earn a living again, my right-brain
characters valued a more peaceful life, at a slower pace, with more time
spent sharing deep and meaningful connections with my family and friends.

My mother had been caring for me post-stroke, and had just turned 70,
while my dad was in his early 80s. Moving back to Indiana, where I could
enjoy time with them while they were still alive, became my priority. I had
learned how fragile life is, and the preciousness of true and meaningful
connections took center stage in who I wanted to be.

Before the stroke, I had been proactive and willing to compromise my
relationships by moving away from both my home and those I loved for the
status and monetary gain of a career as a neuroanatomist at Harvard.
Although I was truly grateful to recover the vast and important abilities of
my left-brain Character 1, post-stroke I was no longer willing to choose the
treadmill of work, work, work. Pre-stroke, my left-brain Character 1 had
defined success through the achievement of external reward. Post-stroke,
my right-brain characters found meaning through the internal standards of
loving, being loved, and being in service to others.

I have named my recovered Left Thinking Character 1 “Helen” because
she is hell on wheels and she gets stuff done. I have learned that I am
completely dependent on Helen if I am to be a functional human being in
the external world. However, as much as Helen would like to restore her
crown and become the dominant character in my brain again, that’s not
going to happen.

Helen is, by any measure, a fantastic character, and I am truly grateful
that she has come back online so I can be competent again. But Helen is
neither my friendliest nor my _best_ self, so much so that when my friends
call on the phone and recognize Helen is in charge, they say “Hi, Helen,”
and lovingly ask if I will return their call later in the day.



### **LEFT-BRAIN CONSCIOUSNESS**

Our left brain is designed to create order out of the randomness of the
cosmic flow, and just as the eagle is capable of zooming its focus in on that
prairie dog, our left brain is capable of distinguishing two items as separate
from one another by examining their differences. Once our left brain
identifies two things as separate, it can then organize and categorize those
things, based upon their details.

For example, I can distinguish between a donkey and a boat because they
are two very different things, sharing only a few similarities. With a little
refinement, my left brain can tell a donkey from a monkey because,
although they share similarities such as limbs and a head, there are still a lot
of differences. With yet a higher level of refinement in my left brain’s
ability to process details with an exacting precision, I can differentiate
between a donkey and a horse. Although structurally they look a lot alike, I
can identify their subtle differences and categorize them appropriately.

Besides the ability to differentiate between things, somewhere along the
line our left brain manages to manifest both an identity and a consciousness.
Without writing a dissertation, for our purposes I will define consciousness
for the left brain as an awareness of itself and its relationship with the
external world.

The primary building blocks of the physical world are things, and as I
noted above, our left brain is the masterful tool we use to perceive a thing
as separate from the background of the cosmic flow. Our left brain
identifies individual things by shifting its perception in such a way that it
can compare, critically analyze, and distinguish minute differences in the
structure and texture of particles in flow. By focusing completely at the
level of things, our left brain creates a new level of consciousness.

You might remember back in the ’90s when the Magic Eye stereo images
became a fad. Two images were merged together into one image, and
depending on how you focused your eyes, you could see either the most
obvious two-dimensional image or the three-dimensional image that was
hidden inside. The shift in our plane of focus that characterizes the left

brain’s perception is not exactly the same as what was going on with the
Magic Eye images, but the principle is comparable.

In addition to viewing the external world at the level of things, through
refinement and higher levels of differentiation our left brain defines the
_edges_ of where we begin and end as individuals. It does this by
manufacturing a holographic image of ourselves so we can delineate
between what is inside of us and what is outside of us. When this happens,
our left brain perceives the physical world as separate and concludes there
is an external reality and an internal reality.

The external world and our relationship with it move to the forefront of
our focus because now we are separate from the whole. This means we are
no longer safe because with life and separation from the cosmic flow comes
the threat that there is now something we can lose, which is the “me-self” as
the center of the universe, as well as life itself. Because we have become
the center of our own universe, our left-brain ego-cells come online and
begin organizing everything in the external world around our individuality.

With this shift of focus toward our relationship with the external world as
separate from ourselves, the consciousness of the eternal flow remains, but
shifts into the background. Focused on the prairie dog, our now conscious
left brain ignores the background landscape, and the holistic realm of our
right-brain perception is set aside.

With our left brain now manufacturing a new level of consciousness
whereby we perceive things and our relationship with those things as
outside of ourselves, we generate higher levels of order that eventually
reach an advanced level of sophistication. The cells of our left-brain
thinking Character 1 organize, categorize, count, list, and eventually name
everything once they have structurally manifested language for
communication with others.

As we saw in Part I, with the addition of our higher cortical thinking
tissue, we humans have not only added new cells and circuits but we have
achieved a functional consciousness that places us at the top of the food
chain. By gaining the ability to think rationally, we have become able to
create predictable routines and mechanically fit things together based upon
their structure. These order-driven cells of our left brain account for both
our reality-based consciousness and our elevated status.

By this point, our left-brain skill sets are well developed, and Character 1
storms in with the intention of ruling the roost. Our Character 1 is our

power in the world and also the face we show: as we saw in Chapter 2, it
corresponds to the archetype of the Persona, which Jung defined as “a kind
of mask, designed . . . to make a definite impression upon others.” [1] As our
alpha self, our Character 1 will compete when it is challenged and fight for
what it believes in. Using its ability to discriminate between this and that,
our Character 1 will define what is right or wrong and what is good or bad.
In this way, our left-brain thinking tissue establishes for us a worldview and
belief system within which we will make our decisions and evolve our life.

At the same time our left thinking brain is manipulating data in both
linear and methodical formats, it is simultaneously laying down new neural
connections in response to novel stimulation. Life is an ongoing event, and
the more we learn, the more our left brain wants to learn. Neuroplasticity is
the ability of our brain cells to rearrange which other neurons they are
communicating with, and this underlies our ability to learn new material.

Because our brain is a product of both its nature and our nurture of it, we
have the power to voluntarily change the cellular structure underlying our
thoughts and feelings. For humanity this means that for the first time in the
history of life on this planet, as far as we are aware, we have the power to
direct our own evolution to a higher level of intercommunication.

Let’s do it with a full understanding about the different parts of our brain
and the power we have to use our thoughts to change the anatomical
structure of the cells underlying those thoughts. We can do this through
meditation and mindfulness, of course, and by using the Brain Huddle we
can strengthen the relationships between our Four Characters, making that
level of open communication the norm inside of our brain.



### **CHARACTER 1 IN THE WORLD**

Our left-brain Character 1 has the ability to be purposeful and intentional
as well as thorough. By grouping things in repeatable and predictable
routines, our left brain can construct a physical world that feels familiar,
and thus, although we are separate from it, we can feel safe within it.
Having gained an individual consciousness, our left brain becomes a true
master at organizing things in space. We organize hierarchically when we
judge one thing more important than another, we manage time such that we
can be punctual, and when we make plans, we are organizing our behavior
across time.

Character 1s wake up in the morning and see the day as something to be
conquered. They are eager beavers who rise early, love routines, and thrive
on crossing things off their lists. On the job, Character 1s are effective
leaders and good at managing people, places, and things. They laser focus
their minds on details and are extremely productive. They are highly critical
of their own performance and consistently compare themselves with others.
Every day is a chance to sharpen their skills, and it is important to Character
1s to bring their most efficient selves forward.

True to their nature, Character 1s must create order in the space around
them, and they value neatness because appearances matter. Everything a
Character 1 does is deliberate because if something is worth doing, it is
worth doing well. Time has value, so Character 1s are not only punctual but
often arrive a few minutes early. You can be certain that the Character 1s
who arrived before you noticed if you were late.

Character 1s value material goods, buy quality products, take care of
their things, and are sure to give you the stink eye if you don’t put the
stapler back from where you took it. Our Left Thinking Character 1 is good
at earning, organizing, and investing money and is excellent at both selfpromotion and confrontation.

By design, Character 1s are gifted rational thinkers with a strong mastery
of reality, so they reason their way to their best decision. Because they have
taken the time to deliberate why they think what they think, they take

responsibility for what they do. If there is a perfectionist inside of your
brain, rest assured it is your Character 1.

Thank goodness our human brain has evolved to have the Character 1
skill set. Because of their organizational skills in government, academia,
and business, we exist in an orderly society. As a result of their natural
abilities, as a collective species we have a neuron on which we can hang an
idea. Besides being great at fixing things, cleaning up messes, and running
tight schedules all at the same time, our Character 1 respects authority,
obeys rules, and consequently tends to keep us from doing really stupid
things.



### **CHARACTER 1 AT WORK AND AT PLAY**

Let’s take a glimpse at how our Character 1 tends to show up in a couple
of real-life scenarios. We will explore this character in action in much more
depth in Part III, when we look at how the Four Characters operate in
different areas of our lives. Please consider this a brief preview.

Note that as we observe our Character 1 in the wild, in some cases we
will distinguish between our “Soft 1,” which occurs when our Character 1 is
absent of emotion, and our “Hard 1,” which is generated in response to an
alarm sounded by the deeper left-brain emotional tissue of our Character 2.
As this implies, when played in isolation, our Soft 1 tends to be kind,
thoughtful, relatively available, and a great team builder. Our Hard 1, on the
other hand, is generated in response to an emotional upset of our Character
2. Consequently, our Hard 1 comes online feeling as though it is managing
an emergency, because it is doing just that even if the emergency is only
inside of its own mind.

Fortunately the majority of Character 1s that I interact with are Soft 1s,
who are organized, competent, efficient, and also kind. Sometimes, if we
are brought up in an environment where our emotional alarm is routinely
triggered, our Character 1 gets trained to be a Hard 1. If you are willing to
explore the motivators underlying your Character 1, you may find that you
are a Soft 1. But if your Character 1 has grown out of the stress and anxiety
circuitry of your Character 2, your Character 1 may be more of a
commander in chief than a team leader.

Prior to the stroke, my left-brain emotional Character 2 existed in a high
state of alarm, so my pre-stroke Helen was definitely a Hard 1. I remember
how sitting in a boardroom would drive me out of my mind because
everything took so long. And every time someone veered away from the
agenda, I felt harsh judgment and literally felt physical pain in my body in
the form of severe anxiety. My Character 2 was always revved up because
of the trauma in my childhood, and being able to relax was not in my
vocabulary. But after I had the stroke and that little Character 2 circuitry
was wiped out, so was my sense of desperation and urgency. When Helen
came back online post-stroke, she was Soft and much more pleasant to be

around because she was no longer riding a full throttle alarm from my
youth.
### **Character 1 on the Job**

Character 1 leaders think linearly and start projects at the logical
beginning. In order to understand the Character 1 as a leader in business,
however, we must distinguish between the leadership styles of the Hard and
Soft Character 1s. The Hard 1 will lead a group like a cattle driver who
circles the herd and drives the working team with a prod from behind. The
Hard 1 is the leader of the team, not a part of the team. The Soft 1, in
contrast, leads a team like a shepherd who circulates among their flock,
helping them as they go.

The Hard 1 leader is an influential critical thinker who leads their team
based on vetted ideas and data. They value their team as a workforce rather
than as a group of people. For the Hard 1 leader, there are real
consequences for success and failure. They value reason and believe
emotions don’t belong in the workplace. The Hard 1 considers emotions to
be a vulnerable weakness, in both themselves and in others. They take pride
in their ability to laser focus on work and see themselves as higher on the
food chain than those working below them. The Hard 1 reinforces this
separation of value by never saying “me too” or showing their vulnerable
underbelly.

The Hard 1 leader is the head of the pack, not interested in connecting
with the worker beyond the task at hand. They have a great poker face in
the middle of chaos and uncertainty, so the team is never really privy to the
true status of the overall project. Because the Hard 1 authoritatively directs
the project from above and keeps the big picture of the project from the
team, workers are kept in a small state of mind. This helps the Hard 1
maintain authority, as it is virtually impossible for anyone on the team to
knowledgably challenge the wisdom of their leader when they don’t really
know what is going on.

The Hard 1 has a preconceived expectation about what it wants to
accomplish and is focused on the results rather than the steps the team has
to take along the way. Hard 1 leadership functions linearly and piecemeal,
so holistic solutions to fundamental problems may not be identified until it

is too late. If the team does not have the bird’s-eye view of what it is trying
to accomplish, and there is no road map for a successful execution, the team
cannot predict or compensate for either minor or significant pitfalls when
they arise.

As I noted earlier, the Hard 1 leader is driven by a state of agitation that
is brewed at the level of its left-brain emotional Character 2. The Hard 1’s
circuitry is triggered to protect its Character 2, which is caught in a
repetitive loop of fear. If the Hard 1 pauses or fails, it won’t be able to
outrun the monster that is nipping at the heels of its Character 2. Therefore
rest and risk are hard for the Hard 1 leader, who is habitually up at 4:15 a.m.
to get the edge on its competitor.

Hard 1 leaders are highly self-critical. When they score a win, they take it
personally, but standing alone at the top of the project, the Hard 1 leader
will still feel isolated and empty. They cannot be content, kick back, and be
at ease because with each victory comes yet another mountain to climb and
another monster to escape. Lurking just beyond success is the ominous
sense of _What’s next?_ And when a Hard 1 fails, they fail hard.

Hard 1 workers, like Hard 1 leaders, function well in a highly organized
environment. They need to have a clear definition of what success looks
like because they operate from a fear of failure. The Hard 1 worker focuses
on the big win at the end rather than celebrating the little successes along
the way.

You will get top performance from Hard 1 workers, but they do what
they are asked to do and nothing more. They don’t have the insight needed
to truly think for themselves or bring genius or insight to a project. But
then, Hard 1 leaders are not interested in having anyone else involved in the
thinking, as they see others as a threat to their superior status. As a result, a
Hard 1 leader tends to work well with Hard 1 workers, providing those
workers are not eyeing the leadership position.

When it comes to change, Hard 1s are a tough crowd unless they can use
that change to promote their own advantage. For example, they will
embrace new technology, like a shift in software or hardware, if they
believe it will help them get ahead of the competition. However, although
they will demand that the change take place, the Hard 1 leader will not be
helpful in the execution of the change. Hard 1 leaders will endure the
inconvenience of change as long as the end result gives them an edge.

Similar to Hard 1 leaders, Soft 1 leaders are strong thinkers, but they are
compassionate in their understanding that their team is made up of people
who both think and feel. Soft 1s lead a team with empathy and assume
errors come from a person’s ignorance rather than from their incompetence.
A Soft 1 leader operates from the conviction that everyone is doing their
best work, which stems from their best thinking. Therefore, if a problem
presents itself mid-project, the Soft 1 leader merely needs to tweak the
team’s thinking to help everyone get back on track. The Soft 1 leader hangs
around and is a vital part of the team, not separate from them, and is not
afraid to say, “me too.” Workers feel like they are working _with_ their Soft 1
boss rather than _for_ that person.

Soft 1 leaders create a vision and provide a road map for their team, so
each member understands their role in the project. The Soft 1 leader defines
what success and failure look like right from the beginning. Because they
do so, everyone on the team is clear about their job, and they can feel safe
because they know what is expected of them.

The Soft 1 leader is hands-on, but not micromanaging. Under these
conditions, workers feel supported and valued at every step of the way. That
is why, under the management of the Soft 1 leader, workers take pride in
their efforts and engage not only mechanically but emotionally. As a group
they become invested in wanting their team to succeed to the end goal, and
off they go.

The Soft 1 is driven by its need to do its best and to make the world a
better place. As a leader, the Soft 1 is an active participant in the team’s
overall dynamics. They keep abreast of everything going on in all of the
departments, and in this way they shepherd the team forward. When it
comes to change, the Soft 1 will embrace something like new technology,
trusting that it will contribute to the overall success of the team and
ultimately the company.

When a Soft 1 makes a winning effort, it is a win for the team, and the
Soft 1 keeps spirit true by celebrating the little wins along the way. The Soft
1 views complications as opportunities rather than as failures, and thus
minimizes the risk to each individual team member. Consequently, each
worker feels safe to take their next step forward, and together they
collectively advance to correct the wrong and create another small win.
With every success the Soft 1 says, “We win,” in contrast to the Hard 1,
who says, “I win.”

Soft 1 leadership sets up a congenial working environment where
everyone can thrive and bring their unique expertise forward. For example,
an audit by the IRS can unnerve just about anyone simply because of the
fear of the unknown and the potential financial repercussions. At the same
time, an audit is an awesome opportunity to have a professional check the
accuracy of your system, free of charge . . . which is all good, providing
they don’t find anything amiss.

But even if there is an error, an audit is an opportunity for an organization
to hit the reset button for its financial accuracy. Although the Hard 1 would
push through an audit, driven by the fears of their Character 2, which is
being chased by yet another monster called the IRS, the Soft 1 would see
the audit as an opportunity to explore with the team. Who has had
experience with this sort of project, and how might they best prepare? The
Soft 1 would then break down the responsibilities and ask everyone to set a
timeline for their accountability. The Soft 1 leader capitalizes on the power
of collaboration and shared ownership of the project.

The Soft 1 worker thrives in an environment that holds people
accountable and on a timeline for their production, and then celebrates the
little wins along the way. Under these circumstances workers know where
they stand with a project, as well as where they stand with the boss, so they
can feel safe, relax, and do their job. That being said, the Soft 1 worker
tends to feel safe in an environment that manages change slowly, rather than
a space that is constantly changing its needs and demands. Large systems
like the government, major corporations, and academic institutions are all
enormous ships that tend to change course slowly and pivot a few degrees
at a time. Under the right circumstances, a Soft 1 worker will thrive on
service, and even venture beyond their job description to serve the team.
### **Character 1 at the Beach**

Character 1s will go to the beach with an agenda to relax, get some
reading done, and enjoy the sunshine. They will bring a well-organized bag
that is filled with all the lovely things they will need, including towels (and
those cute little clasps to bind it to the chair), a drink holder, a book or
Kindle, a phone, a cover-up, sunscreen, and their Warby Parker prescription

sunglasses. They will arrive in brand-name sandals and expensive, stylish
sportswear.

Character 1s will build a little beach station, a functional workspace that
is in perfect order. They will have checked the expiration date on their
sunscreen before they arrived and set a schedule for how much time they
will expose each of their sides to the sun, based on the time of day and the
intensity of the rays. Character 1s will move their chair like a sundial in
response to the movement of the sun for maximum exposure, and they will
know exactly how much reading they can get done before it is time to turn
over. Character 1s are aware of those around them and take appropriate
precautions to protect their electronics and other possessions in response to
the unconscious migration of the children who are playing behind them.

Character 1s naturally attend to details, so sitting next to the trash is not
an option. The Character 1s’ organized workstation could be here, home, or
in a car on a road trip. They are well organized, take care of their things,
and can bring along their little bag of goodies with them, no matter where
they go. If they choose to play volleyball, Character 1s are competitive, so
they will play to win.

When Character 1s hang out in a group, inclusion is important to them,
so on the beach the group may be wearing matching visors and have the
same beach toys but in different colors. Character 1s don’t want to stand
out, so they set a schedule that ensures they will eat together, play together,
and go to the bathroom together. And if anyone goes wild and gets a henna
tattoo, they will all follow suit.

When a Character 1 is at the beach, their thinking left brain automatically
seeks differences, so their eyes will compare different kinds of shells and
notice the details of the local birds. They may even carry a little guidebook
about the local fish and flora. If they find something special that they would
like to collect, like shark’s teeth, they focus their eyes and comb the beach
for just that. If they happen to see a dolphin, they will get excited because
they will want to share that story and that experience with their pals.
### **A Snapshot of Your Character 1**

Organizes Everything: _Even my spice rack is alphabetized, and my_
_stapler and scissors are put back where they belong._

Categorizes Well: _The clothes in my closet are grouped by season, and_
_my garage drawers and shelves are labeled._

Is Naturally Mechanical: _I am good at assembling IKEA furniture and_
_Christmas presents for the kids. I really appreciate a good set of_
_instructions, and a clearly written manual thrills me._

Is Neat: _Appearances matter, so I check my clothes, hair, and makeup_
_before I get out of my car or jump onto a Zoom call._

Plans Well: _I run a tight schedule and leave time for the unexpected so_
_I can be on time. I pay attention to quantities so there is always a_
_backup in the closet or pantry._

Respects Authority: _I know exactly where I fall on the ladder of_
_hierarchy. I respect those above me and may dismiss or be in charge of_
_those below me._

Critically Judges Right/Wrong, Good/Bad: _I strive to be moral, and it_
_is important to me to be right._

Is Detail Based: _I am excellent with details, exact with numbers, and_
_an overall perfectionist in everything I do._

Counts Everything: _Whether it is the number of stairs as I descend, the_
_amount of money in my wallet, or someone’s failures, I am keeping_
_track._

Is Protective: _I divide people into we and they. I protect my we against_
_their they. We are right and they are wrong. We are better than they_
_are, and our needs are more important._



### **Getting to Know Your Character 1**

At this point I encourage you to take some notes about your own
Character 1. These questions are designed to help you identify with
this part of your brain. The more familiar we become with our
Character 1, the easier it becomes for us to recognize this character
when it is present and to become this character by choice.

If you prefer to skip these questions for now and continue
reading, please feel free to do so. I realize this level of personal
reflection requires time, focus, and courage. When you are ready,
these pages will be an invaluable tool for you to identify this part of
your consciousness.

**1. Do you recognize your Character 1? Pause for a moment and**
**imagine yourself doing Character 1 tasks whereby you are**
**creating order. Picture yourself in your office, or planning an**
**event, or organizing things in your home.**

My Character 1 is the consummate professional part of my brain,
which thrives in the challenge of juggling multiple projects at the
same time. She loves catching up on bills, chasing details for a
presentation, and even keeping my taxes well organized. But my
Character 1, Helen, is in a hurry, highly focused, and not my most
patient self. She demands competence and efficiency from herself as
well as from others. When Helen steps into a room, she assesses
quickly who she needs to speak with, influence, or be influenced by.

**2. What does Character 1 feel like inside of your body? Do you**
**feel relaxed or excited when you are busy tending to details? Do**
**you stand differently, or does your voice change? Do you feel**
**tension in your chest, gut, or maybe your jaw?**

Although I have a strong Character 1, this is not my primary type,
so when I am running the circuitry of my left thinking brain, it is
somewhat of a discomfort for me physically. Because my Character
1, Helen, is a bit uptight, her poker “tells,” if you will, include a
recognizable furrow in my brow, and she insists on clenching my
jaw. It’s pretty easy for just about anyone to spot my Character 1
because she speaks with a certain tone that is decidedly more
monotone or interrogative than my usual vocal inflection. In
addition, she is relatively stern and preoccupied with getting things
done so I can cross them off the list.

**3. What if you don’t recognize this part of yourself?**

If you absolutely cannot identify with this character, that is okay.
However, because each of these characters stems from the
underlying brain circuitry, odds are good that you are wired for
these skills. Neuroanatomically speaking, any neurological infarct or
developmental disease that has the ability to wipe out cells or block
our ability to access circuits could interrupt our ability to experience
this character. This is, of course, exactly what happened to my
Character 1 when I had my stroke. Fortunately Helen was
recoverable, and she did come back online.

If you have not experienced a major brain trauma and you are still
having a hard time identifying your Character 1, you might explore
whether there was someone in your past who not only discouraged
this part of you but perhaps even criticized, shamed, or belittled it.
When we are children, we are completely vulnerable to the
judgment of those around us. Both positive and negative comments
from those we are dependent on hold the power to have a longlasting impact on who we grow up to be. In our attempt to not only
survive but thrive in the company of others, it is natural for us to
shift our behavior to match the acceptable demands of those around
us. If it is dangerous for me to express myself in a certain way, I will
not do it.

Once you begin to notice how and when your Character 1
expresses its skill set in your life, pay attention to what it _feels_ like

inside your body to be that part of yourself. Your Character 1 might
show up as bright and bold. It might be extroverted and naturally
bulldoze others, or it might be shy and diligent, not wanting to
attract any attention. There is no right or wrong here, there is simply
an awareness that this part of you exists. The more awareness you
bring to it, and the more appreciation and validation you offer it, the
stronger that circuitry will grow. In the long run, the more familiar
you become with how this character feels inside of your body, the
more power you will have to either step into or out of this character
by choice.

For more insight into your Character 1 skills, you might just ask
yourself: _When do I assert my authority? When do I make decisions_
_for myself or others? How do I organize my time, my food, or my_
_clothing? What am I responsible for—perhaps a pet, or the grocery_
_shopping? What motivates me to be punctual or to wear appropriate_
_clothes? Is there order in my drawers or cabinets? How am I with_
_money, and how do I nurture my friendships?_

If you still cannot identify your Left Thinking Character 1, or if
that part of you feels either unacceptable or a cause of
embarrassment, consider combing through your past to see if there
was someone, perhaps a teacher, parent, sibling, or even a friend
who did not value your opinion or approve of you using your voice.
Was there someone who insisted on being the voice of authority
over you, or who felt the need to control your finances? Did anyone
insist on taking care of the details of your life because they thought
you were inept, or did someone keep track of your failures and then
keep reminding you of your incompetence? The dance we do with
one another is not always a healthy one, and although our Character
1 abilities are invaluable for living a successful life, it is possible for
one person’s Character 1 to oppress another’s Character 1 through
either harsh judgment or coy manipulation.

If all of that fails, you might consider seeking input from
someone else—maybe a friend, spouse, or colleague—about how
they see this part of you. They may have a stronger sense of your
Character 1 than you do, or they may know exactly the condition of
your car and drawers and agree completely that this part of you is
pretty much missing in action. It is true that some people thrive on

chaos and somehow manage just fine without a strong Character 1
even in a world that values order.

**4. Assuming you can identify your Left Thinking Character 1,**
**how much of the time do you let this character run your life,**
**and under what circumstances?**

As I mentioned, I have the utmost respect for Helen and her skills
because she is awesome at what she does, and she makes my life run
smoothly. However, there is a different character inside of me that I
prefer to have as my primary character most of the time.

Let me say right up front that no matter which of the Four
Characters tends to be dominant in you, we are all unique and our
diversities are our strengths. Your Left Thinking Character 1 might
be the best lead for you, but personally, I tend to want to spend a lot
more time playing than Helen is comfortable with. That is why my
Four Characters have put Helen on a schedule that all of my
characters have negotiated. You may be just the opposite from me
and choose to schedule your playtime, with your work time as your
default. Rest assured: there is no right or wrong here, just as long as
all Four Characters have an equal voice and can agree. For inner
peace, all four need to be heard, respected, and validated.

My Character 1, Helen, keeps my life in order by making lists,
but she does not create all the lists on her own. Instead, she has
invited each of my Four Characters to cooperate with her. When any
of my characters is aware that something needs attention, they add it
to the list. Consequently, all of my characters work in support of
Helen to help her be the best she can be, and that strengthens her
resolve simply because she feels valued. When all Four Characters
execute the Brain Huddle, which we touched on in the last chapter
and will explore in depth in Chapter 8, they become a unanimous
and fortified voice, leaving no room for temptation or
procrastination.

If Character 1 is your primary character, hopefully you really like
this part of yourself and know it well. Character 1s live in the real
world, and they thrive when permitted to control details and create

order in our lives as well as the lives of those around us. Just a
heads-up, however: it is our Character 1 who tends to run our stress
circuit, so it will be important for our other characters to help us stay
healthy and well balanced.

**5. As you think about your Left Thinking Character 1, can you**
**come up with an appropriate name for it?**

Helen is my “hell on wheels” personality, and she totally rocks
out the to-do list. Thanks to her, I know the boundaries of where I
begin and end, and she is the home of my ego-self and identity.
Because Helen is great with details, I know who I am, I remember
my past, I learn from my mistakes, and I can find my way home.

How about you? What feels right for you to call your Character
1? What are three things you particularly like about this part of
yourself?

**6. Who are some of the Character 1s in other people over the**
**course of your life who have influenced you, in positive or**
**negative ways? Was your Character 1 emboldened by their**
**Character 1, or repressed?**

I’m guessing it will be easy for you to identify some of the
influential Character 1s in your life. When I was a child, my mother,
G. G., was nicknamed “the hostess with the mostest” by her peers.
She not only ran our home like clockwork but she shouldered her
college classroom and my father’s congregation of some 300
families. As a Character 1 overachiever, G. G. took the prize.

Having order in my life as a child was very helpful, but I can’t
say I always liked it. If G. G. was committed to anything, it was
training her children to have strong Character 1s. This proved to be
an uphill battle since, as it turned out, my father didn’t have an
ounce of Character 1 in him. However, with G. G. modeling a strong
Character 1, and Hal modeling chaos, this combination really helped
me value the gift my mother was trying to instill in me. Order is a

beautiful thing, and it does make the world go around more
smoothly.

Another really powerful Character 1 in my life was Mrs. Valerie
O’Rear, my English: Advanced Composition teacher in high school.
That woman absolutely terrified me, but for some reason, I
performed better for her than any instructor before or since. She was
both a big thinker and a detail monger who oozed with expertise.
She gave us her best and expected the same in return. Even though
she petrified me, she got my attention and I learned from her. Just
look at me now . . . I write. Even though she is probably up in
heaven moaning about my dangling participles and all those
sentences I end with a preposition.

At the same time I can think of several insensitive Character 1s
whom I probably could have lived without, even though they may
have imparted valuable life lessons to me. When I first arrived at
Harvard, most of my colleagues found my bouncy, friendly, and
Midwestern enthusiasm refreshing. However, one of my Character 1
superiors made it perfectly clear that I was way too happy to ever be
a serious scientist. I will admit that his unconstructive influence on
my career may have been part of the reason why I was so motivated
to win the department’s most prestigious research competition.
Although he may have forgotten our exchange, it made it doubly
satisfying for me to receive the award. As a side note, it really is
important that Character 1s be conscious of how their hostile
judgment might negatively influence others.

How about you? Who were some of the powerful Character 1s in
your life, and how did your Character 1, or other parts of you,
respond to them?

**7. Who in your life appreciates, cares for, identifies with, and**
**wants to hang out with your Character 1? What are those**
**relationships like?**

Character 1s tend to prefer the company of other Character 1s,
both professionally and socially. They care about the same sorts of
things and really value their like-minded peers. In the same mode, I

have learned that Helen is a unique duck, and not just anyone wants
to be around her. Some of my friends who are strong Character 1s,
however, are happy to team up and work on projects together,
because there is nothing more productive than a committee of
Character 1s who like and respect one another.

Consequently, Helen resonates well with my accountants, banker,
and administrative assistant, but because Helen is a tool that I use to
get my work done, when I’m not on the clock she fades nicely into
the background. If you happen to be a primary Character 1, you and
I are probably living very different lives. Having said that, thank
you for making the world go around.

**8. Who in your life does not get along with your Character 1?**

When my father was 80, he flipped and spiraled a beautiful Miata
convertible while traveling across the country. On that fateful day, I
became his primary caregiver for the next 16 years. Prior to this
accident, Hal and I were blessed with a fantastic relationship. We
were friends, and we had a lot in common because we were both
primarily energetic and creative Character 3s. But everything
changed between us on the day of his accident. Instead of being his
daughter and his pal, I became the authoritative female in his life,
who looked like his mother and sounded like his ex-wife (G. G.).

Because of the accident, I had to step in to take care of Hal’s
financial world, his medical needs, and everything else that lands on
a caregiver. It wasn’t a job I asked for, but it was a job that fell to me
as the only local child capable of doing it. The hardest part for me
was that although my Helen had all the responsibility, she did not
have enough actual power to protect Hal from being taken
advantage of. In the big picture, Hal became resentful that he was
now under my thumb, and he railed against the authority of my
Character 1 when all I wanted to do was keep him safe. I’m sure he
didn’t realize that the more he rebelled, the more rigid my Helen had
to become to keep the order. It was a very unpleasant experience for
both of us.

I’m guessing your Character 1 has also had some pretty
challenging relationships, with family members, friends, or perhaps
even a colleague at work. It is often hard for others to voice their
appreciation for the way our Character 1s work on their behalf, and
isn’t it refreshing when someone actually does express their
gratitude? It is true that there may be a fine line between my doing
you a favor and overstepping a boundary. I think it is important to
remember that in general, Character 1s really are just trying to be
helpful.

**9. What kind of parent, partner, or friend is your Character 1?**

Years ago I introduced a friend to her Four Characters, and she
realized that she parented her two children completely differently.
She showed up for her son as her creative Character 3, as she was
his head cheerleader, and only offered advice when he solicited it.
For her daughter, however, she parented from her Character 1,
offering her opinion and consistently playing the devil’s advocate.
My friend noted that her relationship with her son was healthy and
carefree, but her relationship with her daughter was stressed and
often contentious. She promptly chose to shift her parenting style
with her daughter to include her other characters, and their
relationship immediately improved.

As we take a closer look at our Left Thinking Character 1, it is
easy to note that this part of ourselves may appear as a bit cold,
robotic, or emotionally unavailable. That is because this part of our
brain is specifically designed to create order out of the disorder in
the world around us. In its most pure form, our Character 1 is not
designed to express emotions. Instead, as we discussed in Part 1, our
left-brain thinking tissue Character 1 has been added on top of the
left-brain emotional tissue specifically to refine and temper our
potentially disgruntled Character 2. As a result, our Character 1 can
often be found parenting, supporting, or even disciplining our own
Character 2.

**10. How kind is the relationship inside your head between your**
**Character 1 and your other characters?**

I may be jumping a little ahead of myself because we have not yet
fully examined all Four Characters in detail, but my guess is that
you are probably gaining a pretty good sense of how they each show
up in your life. I am a true believer that the most important
relationships we have are the ones that are being carried out inside
of our own head. As a result, it is really important that we consider
how your Character 1 views and interacts with your other
characters.

When I was in early elementary school, I was sent home for
wearing a striped shirt with plaid pants. Apparently the other little
girls’ Character 1s were offended by my mismatch, and the teacher
thought it would be wise for me to change because they were
belittling me. My little Character 3 didn’t understand what the
problem was because, from my perspective, I was happy wearing
my favorite top with my favorite pants. My little intuitive right brain
was not even capable of considering that this could be either a
sensory violation or remotely problematic.

It wasn’t until my college years that Helen came online full force.
This makes sense because I was away from home for the first time,
and G. G. was no longer convenient to keep the order in my life.
Frankly, if I did not want to live like a total slob, I had to show up
for myself and start taking care of things. I will admit that it didn’t
happen naturally for me until I fell in love with the study of
anatomy, and academic success demanded a high level of order.

Predictably, the more organized and structured I became, the
more I studied and the better grades I made. To my dismay,
however, my left-brain Character 1 suddenly judged my fencing and
tennis playing as a complete waste of time. Helen came on strong
and found my more relaxed characters as unruly or disagreeable. At
some unique time for each of us, we must learn to graciously
negotiate the division of time we spend between work and play. I
know that for many of us, finding this balance is one of our greatest
ongoing personal challenges.
