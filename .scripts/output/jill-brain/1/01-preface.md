### Peace Is Just a Thought Away

In 2008 I received an invitation to give a TED talk. At that point in time,
there were only six TED talks online and I had no idea what TED was. (It
turned out to stand for Technology, Entertainment, and Design.) The TED
talk “My Stroke of Insight” that I gave in Monterey, California, was the first
to ever go viral on the Internet. As a result TED and I became globally
famous simultaneously.

In that talk I shared with the audience my story of surviving a massive
cerebral hemorrhage in which the left hemisphere of my brain shut down
and the right hemisphere became dominant. I described how I, through the
eyes of a neuroscientist, watched with fascination as my circuits and
faculties went off-line. I took the audience on a journey into the
deterioration of my own left brain, whereby I shifted into a state of peaceful
euphoria and oneness with the universe, unlike anything I had ever known
before.

Within three months of delivering that talk, I was chosen as one of _Time_
magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in the World for 2008. I became the
premiere guest on Oprah’s Soul Series web-cast, and my memoir, _My Stroke_
_of Insight: A Brain Scientist’s Personal Journey_, was published by Penguin
Books. It spent 63 weeks on the _New York Times_ bestseller list. Today, over
12 years later, it remains the number one book in the Amazon marketplace
on the subject of stroke, and in the top ten in other subjects including
Anatomy Science, Medical Professional Biographies, and Nervous System
Diseases.

That 18-minute presentation instantly changed my world, and many other
lives were permanently shifted too. I still have TEDsters come up to me to

share what row they were sitting in on that fateful afternoon, and over 25
million views later, that talk remains one of the most popular TED talks of
all time. I have received hundreds of thousands of emails over the years
from people asking how they, too, can access that peaceful euphoria I
described.

Unquestionably, in many ways that TED talk was an amazing success.
But in my heart the talk failed to accomplish one thing I had hoped it
would do. I wanted us, as human beings, to recognize that we are connected
as part of a whole, and I wished for us to treat one another with a higher
degree of respect and kindness. Instead, our civility toward one another has
clearly decayed over the past decade and more.

Perhaps this is not so surprising, given that we live in a world where our
politics, relationships, and life in general are spiraling into an
uncomfortable state of chaos. Life is tough with its highs and lows, and
none of us came into this world with a manual for how to get it all right.
But what I have learned is that we do have the power to pause, sidestep our
habituated patterns, and make better choices. We have the power to choose
moment by moment who and how we want to be in the world.

That ability, like every ability we have, is dependent on the cells in our
brain that perform that function. Our brain is a magnificent tool that is the
home of our thoughts, emotions, experiences, and behaviors. When we
understand at a cellular level what is going on in the relationship between
our thoughts and our emotions, we no longer have to be bound by our
emotional reactivity. Instead, we can become emboldened to live our best
lives and be our best selves. We have much more power over what is going
on inside of our heads than we have ever been taught.

Much of the material in this book stems from my own experience with
watching my brain break down due to trauma, and then insights I gained as
the cells in my brain recovered. In the big picture, this book is about our
shared journey into the challenges of our lives and what our choices are in
how we can live our best life while taking our brain anatomy into account.
In these pages you will encounter a new paradigm for understanding how
the different parts of our brain work together to manifest our perception of
reality, along with a set of tangible tools you can use to not only master
your brain’s emotional reactivity, but ultimately live a whole-brain life.

You are the life-force power of the universe and your human brain is
amazing far beyond your wildest imagination. This book will clarify for

you exactly what that means and what your options are as you learn to own
your power and apply these tools to create the life you want to live. This
book is your road map to peace, which really is just a thought away.
