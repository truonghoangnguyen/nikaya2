SUTTA 92

[^867]: The text of this sutta has not been included in the PTS ed. of the Majjhima Nikāya, as it is identical with the sutta of the same name in the Sutta Nipāta, published in two different versions by the PTS. The bracketed page numbers here therefore refer to the more recent PTS ed. of Sn , that edited by Dines Anderson and Helmer Smith.

[^868]: That is, Jambudīpa, the Indian subcontinent.
