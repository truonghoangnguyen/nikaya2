SUTTA 151

[^1347]: MA: The arahant's fruition attainment of voidness. See n. 458 and n. 1144.

[^1348]: MA: This is the abiding of such great men (mahäpurisa) as Buddhas, paccekabuddhas, and the great disciples of the Tathāgatas.

[^1349]: Among the five terms, desire and lust are synonymous as are hate and aversion.

[^1350]: Beginning with this section a sequence of development may be discerned. The abandoning of the five cords of sensual pleasure is the preliminary step for developing the jhānas, and the abandoning of the five hindrances ( §10 ) the immediate antecedent to the attainment of the first jhāna. The full understanding of the five aggregates ( §11 ) indicates the insight wisdom necessary to attain the path of stream-entry, and the sections on the thirty-seven requisites of enlightenment ( §§12-18 ) the cultivation of the factors needed to arrive at the intermediate stages of sanctity. The section on serenity and insight ( §19 ), though applicable to all stages, can be seen as fully actualised by the non-returner striving for arahantship. Finally, the section on true knowledge and deliverance signifies the attainment of the path and fruit of arahantship.

[^1351]: Although the arahant, who has fully realised true knowledge and deliverance, has no need for further training, he continues to cultivate serenity and insight in order to enter into the bliss of the jhānas, the fruition attainment of
arahantship, and the cessation of perception and feeling.
