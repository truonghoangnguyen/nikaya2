# The SuttaCentral Editions Series

Since 2005 SuttaCentral has provided access to the texts, translations, and parallels of early Buddhist texts. In 2018 we started
creating and publishing our translations of these seminal spiritual
classics. The “Editions” series now makes selected translations
available as books in various forms, including print, PDF, and
EPUB.
Editions are selected from our most complete, well-crafted, and
reliable translations. They aim to bring these texts to a wider audience in forms that reward mindful reading. Care is taken with
every detail of the production, and we aim to meet or exceed professional best standards in every way. These are the core scriptures
underlying the entire Buddhist tradition, and we believe that they
deserve to be preserved and made available in the highest quality
without compromise.
SuttaCentral is a charitable organization. Our work is accomplished by volunteers and through the generosity of our donors.
Everything we create is offered to all of humanity free of any copyright or licensing restrictions.
# Preface

The topic of the future weighs heavily on the mind of the Aṅguttara. We live in that future or beyond it. The “future perils” of the
Aṅguttara (AN 5.77–80) are upon us and have been for quite some
time. King Ashoka referred to these suttas, which include the peril
of corruption in the Saṅgha; perhaps he worried that his generosity, though intended to support Buddhism, would ultimately lead
to its decay.
Today the future perils are greater than ever. It is as if the seven
suns are appearing in the sky (AN 7.66). We want to face the future
with hope for a better life, but the horizon dims and draws closer,
while we clutch our loved ones and prepare for the worst.
It was the novelist William Gibson who said, “the future is already here—it’s just not very evenly distributed”. His saying conceals layers of meaning. The future is here because we see scientific,
technological, and human marvels every day that are far beyond
our comprehension. Yet such advances are for the few, and only
tricklegradually,ifatall, topeopleinneed. Thefutureisalsoherein
a negative sense, in that the catastrophic effects of climate collapse
are readily apparent; and yet there too, their effects are unevenly
distributed, massively impacting those who have the least capacity
to deal with them.
The way of the Dhamma is to neither deny such things nor
to be paralyzed by them, but to live, urgently and vitally, in the
present. We live as if the future was uncertain, because it is. Our
only certainty is that all this will disappear.
The Buddha stayed calm in the face of terrors. Living well now,
we let the future take care of itself. The Buddha did not pretend to
be able to control the future, so why should we?
As a Buddhist, I might rephrase Gibson’s saying: “the present
is already here—it’s just not very evenly distributed”. The art of
meditation is the art of presence, and in that presence, we can be
gratefulforallthatwehave, mindfulofallourblessings, andfearless
when facing the future. It is when we lose our presence that our
fears can overcome us. So let us not lose our presence.
# The Numbered Discourses: things that are useful every day

_Bhikkhu Sujato, 2019_

The Aṅguttara Nikāya is the last and longest of the four primary
divisions of the Sutta Piṭaka. The word aṅguttara means “up by one
factor”, i.e. “incremental”. It refers to the fact that the discourses
are arranged by numbered sets, with the numbers increasing by
one. I have translated it as Numbered Discourses, while previously
it has been translated as the Numerical Discourses or the Gradual
_Sayings._
SuttaCentral follows Bhikkhu Bodhi’s translation in counting
8122 discourses in total. The summary verse at the end of the
collection, however, says there are 9,557 suttas. This scribal remark
does not say how this count was arrived at; it must have been quite
a process to count so many discourses when dealing only with
palm-leaf manuscripts. In any case, as with the Saṁyutta Nikāya,
this count is largely a product of discourses repeated according to
templates. Many of these consist only of a single word; indeed, the
process of abbreviation is carried to such extremes that hundreds
of suttas do not exist at all in the text; they are merely numbers to
be filled out. Also, in the case of the Ones and Twos, most of the
suttas are longer texts that have been divided to make the numbers.
On SuttaCentral, these are treated as if one vagga was a sutta, and
the abbreviated texts likewise are combined. If we count the files
of the texts combined in this way, we arrive at more reasonable,
but still very large, 1407 texts of substance.
Thefocusofthe _NumberedDiscourses_ isonpracticalmattersofeveryday relevance. Guidelines of ethics and character predominate.
If the Saṁyutta Nikāya gathers the chief teachings on doctrines, the
Aṅguttara gathers the teachings on persons. The concerns of the
lay community are a major focus, and many teachings deal with
how to teach.
The use of numbered sets is found throughout the Buddhist
texts, but here it becomes the main organizing principle. The typical Aṅguttara discourse consists of a statement that there is certain
number of something; then an explanation of each item; then a
conclusion that echoes the introduction. Sometimes a verse is
added that summarizes the content. This formal pattern is highly
optimized to reinforce learning and memorization. It is, in essence,
thesameformatthatisusedinthenightlynews: beginbylistingthe
news items for today; give the stories of each of the items; and then
summarize the highlights once more. The use of numbered sets
remains popular today, with the “listicle” being a favorite format
for internet articles.
Unlike these modern examples, however, the sets of teachings in
the Aṅguttara are strongly structured. They are not merely collections of items on a theme, but make up an integrated sequence. The
first item is the most fundamental; the subsequent items evolve
from or build upon that; and the final item caps off the sequence.
For this reason the Aṅguttara provides an excellent entry point
to the canon, especially for those with a limited amount of time. It
only takes a few minutes to read a sutta, and it will contain within
itself a complete and useful teaching.
The Aṅguttara Nikāya has a counterpart in the Ekottarikāgama
preserved in the Chinese canon (EA). The Ekottarikāgama is a
peculiar text of uncertain (possibly Mahāsaṅghika) affiliation, and
itdiffersfromthePalitexttoamuchgreaterextentthantheparallels
for DN, MN, and SN. In addition, there are two partial Ekottarikas
in Chinese, as well as several independent Ekottarika style suttas.
Moreover, a substantial portion of a Sanskrit Ekottarāgama was
discoveredatGilgitandhasbeeneditedandpartiallyreconstructed
by Tripāṭhi. While it is difficult to generalize, it seems as if most
of these materials lie closer to the Pali text than the main EA in
Chinese.

##### How the Aṅguttara is Organized

The Aṅguttara Nikāya consists of major “books” (nipāta) numbered one through eleven. Each of these contains discourses consisting of the corresponding number of items. As usual, the discourses are gathered into vaggas, which sometimes have a loose
theme. Each nipāta, except the first, organizes its vaggas into pa_ṇṇāsas._
I don’t know why the Aṅguttara counts to eleven; I wouldexpect
a round number. Eleven is shared in common with the Chinese
Ekottarikāgama, which suggests it was an early feature, yet it does
notappeartobedrivenbythetextsthemselves, asmostoftheitems
in the Book of the Elevens consist of teachings familiar elsewhere,
with the addition of an item or two.
It sometimes feels as if the Aṅguttara was assembled from leftovers. After the long suttas were gathered in the Majjhima and
Dīgha, and the shorter suttas on central themes into the Saṁyutta,
a large mass of texts remained that resisted easy categorization.
This included many fascinating and profound teachings, as well as
a large mass of stock repetitions, and it trailed off into odds and
ends of increasingly obscure value. It’s as if the redactors, faced
with a warehouse of leftovers and bric-à-brac, tried their best to
shelve and stack the items in a logical way, but were often left with
just plonking things on shelves as best they could. Since the texts
usually had a distinct number in the teaching, this was taken as
the organizational principle, in lieu of anything more meaningful.
Even texts that don’t explicitly mention a number can often be
analyzed into a set of items, so they could be included too. (See
[for example AN 3.31 and AN 3.32.)](https://suttacentral.net/an3.31)
To be clear, it should not be thought that the Aṅguttara lacks
the standard teachings familiar from the rest of the nikāyas. On the
[contrary, we find the four absorptions (AN 3.58), the four noble](https://suttacentral.net/an3.58)
[truths and dependent origination (AN 3.61), the faculties and](https://suttacentral.net/an3.61)
[powers (AN 4.163; the latter in some detail at AN 5.12–16), the](https://suttacentral.net/an4.163)
[threefold training (AN 3.81), the divine meditations (AN 3.63),](https://suttacentral.net/an3.81)
and many more. But such teachings are scattered throughout a
large mass of suttas on a diverse range of topics.
In the introduction to his translation, Bhikkhu Bodhi practically
abandons any attempt to make sense of the structure. He gives an
example of a chapter with several seemingly unrelated discourses,
remarking: “With such apparently arbitrary organization, one cannot but wonder what the compilers had in mind.” (The Numerical
_Discourses of the Buddha, introduction, p. 22). As a result, rather_
thananalyzethecontentasitoccursintheAṅguttara, hedeveloped
[an extensive and carefully-considered thematic analysis. This essay](https://suttacentral.net/an-introduction-bodhi)
[is available on SuttaCentral, and I encourage anyone interested in](https://suttacentral.net/an-introduction-bodhi)
a serious study of the Aṅguttara to read it.
I would like to approach the material from a different perspective, however, one that lies closer to the experience of reading the
text. I find Bhikkhu Bodhi’s question an intriguing one: what were
the redactors thinking?
While there is no doubt that the sequence of suttas and ideas
in the Aṅguttara is to some extent chaotic, is it plausible that the
same body of people who displayed such rigorous dedication to
classification in the Saṁyutta should simply abandon their efforts
in the Aṅguttara? Perhaps to understand the redactors better, and
through them the teachings that they worked with, we must approach the problem in a new way.
HerearethreeorganizationalprinciplesthatIhavenoticedwhile
reading the Aṅguttara:

1. Numerological meaning.
2. Thematic clusters, segues, and arcs.
3. Spaced repetition.

Below I will show how these things work out over the first three
_nipātas. In this way, I hope to guide a reader through the wilds until_
they feel comfortable proceeding on their own.
It is surely not the case that these are the only organizational
principles at work. Nor is it the case that they fully explain all,
or even most, of the randomness. But they do, I believe, hint at a
guiding understanding that shaped the collection in the form we
have it today.
One general thought first. Much of how we organize and relate
to the world is not through reason but through association. If
we think of it in terms of the five aggregates, a collection such as
the Saṁyutta Nikāya has an overall structure that is deliberately
thoughtthroughandconstructed, i.e. itisbasedonrationalchoices
or saṅkhārās. Perhaps what we need to look for in the Aṅguttara is
a different way of thinking, one based on perception, memory, and
association (saññā).
But why would such a large mass of texts be organized in such a
way? The answer is not hard to find. Like so many of the principles
that organize the texts, it is for memorization. For a reciter who has
to keep hundreds of texts in order, any kind of connection works.
It doesn’t matter if it’s the topic, a shared word, a syntax, a rhyme,
or anything else. Perception recognizes patterns. It associates one
thing with the next, regardless of how significant the connecting
feature is.
Imagine, if you will, that you’re organizing your library. You
could use a rational system: alphabetical order, subject matter, or
size to fit your shelves. But it’s your library, you can do what you
want. Maybe on one shelf, you put books with blue covers; on another, books you haven’t read; and on another, books whose smell
reminds you of old friends. To anyone else it seems chaotic, but to
you it makes perfect sense. You can find the book you need when
you want to. Perception does the heavy lifting for you, without
the cognitive strain of having to work through the rational system
every time.
###### The meaning of numbers

For the most part the use of numbers in Buddhist texts is entirely
pragmatic. Once you know that a set has a certain number of items,
you can tell if you’ve forgotten something.
Yet numbers have always been imbued with a significance and
meaning that transcends mere accounting. They allow us to make
sense of a complex cosmos through a simple set of conventions.
Numbers are used in Buddhism to provoke awe, even fear, at the
“astronomical” scope of transmigration. Is it possible that the symbolic meaning of numbers lends a sense of unity to the various
_nipātas?_
Symbolic meaning is, by its very nature, impossible to pin down
with precision. Unlike rational definition, it does not serve to
limit the scope of meaning but to amplify it through suggestion,
hints, and connotations. The symbolic meaning of numbers has,
so far as I know, mostly been ignored in Buddhist studies. Some
numerologicalobservationsweremadeinthenumberentriesinthe
Rhys Davids’ and Stede’s Pali-English Dictionary, but I am aware of
little since then. However, we can make a few general observations.

**One The number of harmony, simplicity, and supremacy. It is**
especially emphasized in the context of deep meditation (jhāna
or samādhi). However, unlike many spiritual contexts, in Buddhism it never has a metaphysical sense: Nibbāna is zero, not
one; it is emptiness, not unity.
**Two Used for pairs, which may be partners—hands, eyes, man**
and wife—opponents—good vs. evil, light vs. dark, pain vs.
pleasure—or successors—skill in entering meditation and skill
in leaving it. It represents the dualities of the world.
**Three Made up of 2 + 1. It adds an extra, often spiritual, dimen-**
sion to the worldly dualism of two. This is quite explicit in such
sets as “gratification, drawback, and escape”, and more subtly in,
say, pleasant, painful, and neutral feelings. Three represents the
_other; and it is the other which contains the seed of transcen-_
dence.
**Four The most characteristic number of Buddhism, and the Book**
of the Fours is the largest of the nipātas. Its primary metaphor
is the four quarters, and thus connotes totality and balance,
most obviously in the four noble truths. Multiples of four have
the same meaning at a higher order. Ten is similar, in that it is
derived from the four quarters, the four intermediate quarters,
and above and below.
**Five Stems from the hand, which is what we use to count; hence**
it divides into 4 + 1 (fingers and thumb) rather than 2 + 3. The
most obvious example of this is the five “grasping” aggregates,
where consciousness stands against the other four. Likewise in,
say, the five faculties and powers, wisdom is the “thumb”.
**Six Takes as its root metaphor the body: four limbs, torso, and**
head. The general sense is a “large whole”, and the most prominent set is the six sense fields.
**Seven An astronomical number, derived from the lunar cycles**
and the heavenly bodies (sun + moon + five visible planets). It
is used especially commonly in myth, and has the general sense
of “the entire cycle of life and death”. It appears in this sense in
the story of the Bodhisatta’s birth.

I believe that we can indeed discern traces of these meanings
in the Aṅguttara, and offer some examples below. In some cases,
the texts of a certain number would have been simply imported
into the collection, while in other cases the text would have been
edited specifically to create the necessary numbered set. Either
way, having some sense of these meanings gives us a perspective
through which to see the nipātas as meaningful wholes.
With such general meanings, and doubtless many exceptions
and contradictions, it is not possible to establish beyond doubt
that the numbers of the Aṅguttara have a symbolic meaning. If you
dislike any attempt at reading symbolic meaning, I cannot prove
you wrong. But it does, I believe, give us an approach through
which to appreciate why the redactors dealt with their diverse and
complex material in this way.
###### Thematic clusters, segues, and arcs

Despite its chaotic impression, suttas in the Aṅguttara are rarely
isolated. Most of the time they appear in thematic clusters that deal
with the same topic. This might be just a pair of suttas, though
it’s not uncommon to find an entire vagga on a specific theme.
These are often closely related suttas, simply varying a few details
from one to the next. Or they may have a loose thematic thread,
featuring, for example, the same person, or group of persons. In
several cases, vaggas of the same name and theme appear multiple
times in the collection.
Such thematic clusters are easy to recognize; but still, it often
seems as if there is nothing that connects one cluster with the next.
However, this is not always the case. Often the shift from one
cluster to another happens through what might be called a thematic
_segue. When moving from one thematic cluster to the next, some_
common element is maintained. This might be a topic, or simply
some formal feature—a question format, a word, a syntax, etc.
Such hooks help smooth the transition from cluster to cluster.
In such cases we find that there is some element in the first
cluster [A], which is combined with a second element [AB] to
form a new cluster or extend the old one. Then the second element
is combined with something else to make yet another cluster [BC].
Andperhapslaterthesecondelementisdroppedaltogetherleaving
just the third [C], or it is recombined with something new. If you
compare the first element [A] with the third [C] there’s nothing in
common. Yet the progress from one to the other is gradual. And
the frequency with which this occurs shows that it is by no means
accidental.
Similar techniques are a stock in trade of musical composition.
After introducing a motif, the composer gradually transforms and
develops it. Eventually, they might arrive at a new motif, which
shares nothing in common with the original, but from which it
evolved.
A thematic segue is often a purely formal technique that says
little about the subject matter. However, with careful attention we
can see that thematic clusters, chained together with segues, sometimes evolve over larger spans of text to create a loosely organized
_thematic arc. Such arcs echo teaching frameworks that are familiar_
from elsewhere, such as the Gradual Training. This is used, for example, to inform the shape of the first 75 suttas of the Book of the
Ones. Such arcs are by no means as clear and formally structured
as the teachings on which they are based. Yet the progress from
one topic to the next is undeniable.
Indeed, each nipāta can be seen as forming its own arc, as they
typically begin with basic practices, and end with realizing Nibbāna. The repetition series that round out each nipāta also have
their internal arc, leading towards the highest qualities.

###### Spaced repetition

In the Dīgha and Majjhima Nikāyas, a student would spend a fair
period of time memorizing one specific text, rehearsing it, and—
if they are a good student—inquiring and questioning about the
meaning. Only when it was mastered would they move on to the
next. IntheSaṁyutta,astudentwouldlearndozens,evenhundreds
of suttas on the same topic, sharing similar passages and ideas, and
often varying little one to the other. Such suttas may be memorized
quickly, and interpretive problems often arise at the level of the
topic rather than the individual text.
But memorizing long texts, or many texts on the same subject,
can get boring, for the mind is stimulated by variety and surprise.
IntheAṅguttara, astudentwouldlearnoneortwosuttasonatopic,
or maybe a fewmore, thensomethingelse, thenbacktothe original
topic, then a third. Now, as we have seen, various features help
keep the sequence of texts straight. But perhaps there is something
more to it: perhaps the very randomness and repetition help them
to learn.
This is a lot like the modern technique known as spaced rep
etition”, commonly used for language learning. A vocabulary of
words is introduced one at a time in a random sequence. After
learning one word, one moves on to another. But the first word
is then re-introduced a little later to reinforce learning. And so it
goes, with the same words coming back again and again. In terms
of the sequence from one word to the next, everything is random.
But the overall pattern is carefully optimized to reinforce and speed
up memorization.
Perhaps we could think of it like a school. The Saṁyutta is like
a school curriculum: everything you need to know on a topic, all
in one place. But the Aṅguttara is like a school day. One class
follows the other, and there is no real rhyme and reason to it. Some
things happen fairly regularly and predictably, while others seem to
just pop up at random. Despite its more chaotic nature, it works:
that’s how we learn. No one would suggest that school subjects
are best mastered by first learning the science curriculum, then
the maths, then the history. Not only does the spaced repetition
reinforce learning, but it provokes us to see new and unexpected
connections between things.

##### The Book of the Ones

I have suggested that the number one carries with it a specific set
of connotations, notably harmony, simplicity, and supremacy. If
this is framed as an overall theme, it might be something like this:
keep your spiritual practice simple and focused to help your mind
attaindeepimmersion, andinthatway, youcanrealizethesupreme
Dhamma. Let us see how the Book of the Ones exemplifies these
attributes.
The Book of the Ones is a rather special case in that virtually
the entire nipāta is constructed from fragments and templates. The
collection begins with the striking assertion that no sight occupies
a man’s mind like that of a woman, or a woman’s mind like that of a
man. Theremainderoftheexteriorsensesarelistedforeachgender
binary, making ten suttas in all for the first vagga. This very much
has the appearance of a single sutta divided into ten. In the Fives
[(AN 5.55) we find a similar set of statements given in a particular](https://suttacentral.net/an5.55)
context, dealing with the masculine perspective only. And in the
Chinese, we find that the parallels at EA 9.7 and EA 9.8 fit the two
halves of this vagga. This supports the idea that these texts were
originally combined to form a single sutta, or perhaps a pair of
suttas.
An even clearer example of this is provided by the three pairs of
[suttas at AN 1.76 to AN 1.81. Each of the pairs follows the same](https://suttacentral.net/an1.76)
[pattern, exemplified by the first pair. AN 1.76 says that the loss of](https://suttacentral.net/an1.76)
relatives is a small thing, while wisdom is the worst thing to lose.
[AN 1.77 presents the inverse: growth of relatives is a small thing,](https://suttacentral.net/an1.77)
for wisdom is the best thing to grow. But it continues to round
off the sutta by urging the mendicants to train to grow in wisdom.
This conclusion is lacking in the first of the pair and is a clear sign
that the text has been divided.
One should not conclude from this that the text has been assembled haphazardly. On the contrary, we can identify a series of
arcs that bind long series of suttas together. The opening chapters
are designed to show the development of meditation, echoing the
meditator’s progress in the Gradual Training.

- The first chapter, as we have seen already, deals with the restraint
of sexuality, one of the foundations of meditation.

- The second chapter deals with the hindrances which must be
abandoned before entering deep meditation. This is linked via
a thematic segue from the previous chapter, the link being the
phrase “I do not see a single thing”.

- The third and fourth chapters deal with the advantages of the
developed mind, which has been purified through the process
of meditation: nothing brings greater happiness and benefit.
They continue using the phrase “I do not see a single thing”.

- The fifth chapter abandons the phrase “I do not see a single
thing”. Here the thematic segue is the topic of “mind” (citta)
and its development.
- The fifth chapter ends with two discourses that mention the fa
mous “radiant mind”. These are fragments, and a more complete
statement is found in the following suttas that start the next
chapter. It is somewhat unusual to find such closely connected
suttas broken over a vagga boundary like this. Note that the
“radiant mind” is not a metaphysical term, and neither here nor
anywhere else in the early Buddhist texts is the mind said to be
“intrinsically” or “naturally” or “originally” radiant or luminous.
On the contrary, the mind is conditioned and hence is not “intrinsically” anything at all. The radiant mind is simply a way of
talking about meditative absorption or jhāna.

- The sixth chapter continues on the theme of absorption. How[ever, it changes theme at AN 1.56—though maintaining focus](https://suttacentral.net/an1.56)
on “mind”—and continues by addressing the causality of good
and bad qualities. In context, these can be understood as pertaining to the wisdom portion of meditation, as treated in the
[fourth of the satipaṭṭhānas. This series culminates at AN 1.75](https://suttacentral.net/an1.75)
with the perfection of the awakening factors, thus signifying the
completion of the path.

A structure such as this is particularly telling as it reveals the
intent of the redactors. This thematic arc spanning 75 fragmentary
suttas does not exist in the sources at all: it is purely implied by
the choices of the redactors. Their method was to reduce the statements of the Dhamma to their simplest meaningful elements, then
reassemble them according to the principles of the Dhamma as
they understood them.
And the redactors were even more subtle than that. For not
only are these fragments assembled to form a coherent whole,
but the choice of theme was quite deliberate. Of all the doctrinal
contexts in Buddhism, it is samādhi or “unification of mind” where
the number one is most prominent. In starting with the Ones, the
redactors were sensitive to the use of numbers in the canon, and
arranged their texts to bring the most important “one” to the fore.
[From here, the text shifts focus. As noted above, AN 1.76–81](https://suttacentral.net/an1.71-81)
[deals with pairs of gain and loss. Then from AN 1.82 we have](https://suttacentral.net/an1.82-97)
a series of texts on those things that are harmful and beneficial,
starting with the pair of negligence and diligence. While these
teachings are of course common throughout the canon, it is fitting
that they appear here to represent the Aṅguttara’s special focus on
the fundamentals of a good life. Here they exemplify the aspect of
_simplicity, helping a student to focus on just one aspect of Dhamma_
at a time.
Thesamesetoffactorsistreatedafewtimeswithslightlyvarying
templates, the final of which says that each of these harmful things
leads to the disappearance of Buddhism, while the good things
[lead to its continuation. This leads us up to AN 1.129.](https://suttacentral.net/an1.98-139)
[From AN 1.130–169, the topic of the preservation of the](https://suttacentral.net/an1.98-139)
Dhamma is continued, but applied to a new theme, one that is
quite distinctive of the Aṅguttara: teaching the Dhamma. Specifically, those who present the Dhamma accurately make much merit
and preserve Buddhism, while those who distort or misrepresent
the Dhamma make bad karma and destroy Buddhism. This series
of texts displays its inner structure, as it begins with simply the
“teaching” and then continues to differentiate the Dhamma more
and more finely, especially with the introduction of the Vinaya and
a rather extensive list of technical terms for monastic discipline. It
does not take much to see that an originally simple statement could
have been drawn out by adding multiple aspects of the teaching,
conveniently giving the students of the Aṅguttara some Vinaya
material to learn.
This series of suttas grows out of the former, with the theme of
preserving Buddhism as the thematic segue. Thus we have, from
[AN 1.82 through AN 1.169, a second thematic arc consisting of](https://suttacentral.net/an1.82-97)
88 suttas.
[From AN 1.170 a new theme is introduced, one that also rep-](https://suttacentral.net/an1.170-187)
resents a key aspect of the Aṅguttara: persons. Buddhism is, of
course, most famous for its teachings on not-self, and its impersonal analysis of psychological processes. But there is plenty of
material throughout the suttas that deals with persons, or character
types, and much of that is in the Aṅguttara. These texts were later
assembled to form the Abhidhamma text the Puggalapaññatti, the
“Description of Persons”.
Of all the persons in Buddhism, the incomparable one is the
Buddha himself. While there is a series of Buddhas over the ages,
in our age he is unique. Hence these suttas speak of the “one person”
who arises in the world who is uniquely beneficial and transcen[dent. At AN 1.187 the Buddha’s chief disciple, Sāriputta, is praised](https://suttacentral.net/an1.170-187)
as the one who continues to roll the wheel of Dhamma after the
Buddha. This segues into the next series of suttas, which single out
individual followers of the Buddha for particular praise. This is a
rather fascinating list, in which appear many characters from all
over the canon; not only the four nikāyas, but the Vinaya and the
[Khuddaka as well. Prominent monks appear in AN 1.188–234;](https://suttacentral.net/an1.188-197)
[nuns from AN 1.235–247; laymen from AN 1.248–257; and lay-](https://suttacentral.net/an1.235-247)
[women, from AN 1.258–267. All of these people are “number one”](https://suttacentral.net/an1.258-267)
in their field, exemplifying the sense of “one” as supremacy.
The next chapter continues the theme of “persons”, enumerating
various things that are possible or impossible for various people.
For example, it is impossible for one “attained to view”—that is,
a stream-enterer—to take any condition as permanent. But from
[AN 1.284–295, once again we find a thematic segue; the “person”](https://suttacentral.net/an1.278-286)
vanishes and the theme of possible and impossible is applied rather
on an impersonal level: good things cannot come from bad deeds.
This makes up the third great thematic arc in the Ones, 126
[suttas from AN 1.170 to AN 1.295. The remainder of the Ones](https://suttacentral.net/an1.170-187)
continues similarly, with fragmented suttas assembled along loose
thematic lines. The themes remain similar, with one difference. As
the Book draws closer to its end, the subject of Nibbāna, the final
goal of Buddhism, becomes ever more prominent. The final vagga
is called the “Chapter on the Deathless”, and it deals directly with
the path to full awakening. Thus the sense of thematic unity that
has been evident in multiple sections of the Book of the Ones is
also evident in its overall structure, assembled by the redactors to
culminate in awakening.
##### The Book of the Twos

Thesecond _nipāta_ isakindofbridgebetweenthe“arcsoffragments”
that characterize the first nipāta and the more complete suttas that
become prominent in the remainder of the Aṅguttara. It echoes
and amplifies the themes of the first nipāta, while also introducing
new ideas.
It begins with a series of suttas that speak of the fundamental
[principles of the good life: doing good and avoiding bad (AN](https://suttacentral.net/an2.1-10)
[2.3–4) and the results of deeds in this life and the next (AN 2.1).](https://suttacentral.net/an2.1-10)
This, I think, announces what the redactors aimed to be the chief
theme of this nipāta: the idea that there is a moral order in the
world, there is good and evil, and if we comprehend this we can
live our life well. The collection starts by emphasizing this fact, and
the dire consequences of ignoring it.
The second chapter builds on this, speaking on the “power of
reflection” to look back and understand this moral order, and the
“power of development” to move on from the bad and develop the
[good (AN 2.11–13). A specific example of this is given in the case](https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20)
[of a disciplinary measure within the Saṅgha (AN 2.15; cp. AN](https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20)
[2.21). When one mendicant accuses another of wrongdoing, both](https://suttacentral.net/an2.21-31)
should “reflect” on what happened and their role in the affair, and
only then can the issue be properly healed and everyone move
on. This chapter also details in various respects the way that good
[and bad deeds lead to various results (AN 2.16, AN 2.17), spelling](https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20)
out a series of results that pertain both to this life and the next
[(AN 2.18). The Buddha then introduces the idea of a deliberate](https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20)
practice: one should not only recognize these things and reflect on
them within oneself but develop the good and give up the bad, for
[it is possible to do so (AN 2.19).](https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20)
These suttas (and others) build on the teachings found in the
first nipāta that deal with basic principles. They conclude the opening arc that establishes the theme of this nipāta: the worldly duality
of good and bad, which creates both a responsibility and an opportunity to respond.
But it should not be thought that these chapters are fully coher
ent and systematic. One finds the occasional sutta that appears
[quite random, for example AN 2.10 on entering the rainy season](https://suttacentral.net/an2.1-10)
[retreat; or AN 2.60 on why fauns (kimpurisa) do not use human](https://suttacentral.net/an2.52-63)
speech.
Meanwhile, distinct themes from the first nipāta are also intro[duced, mixed up without clear order. AN 2.14 mentions two ways](https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20)
[of teaching Dhamma—in brief and in detail—while AN 2.20 says](https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20)
that the survival of Buddhism depends on getting both the mean[ing and the phrasing of the texts correct (also see AN 2.41). AN](https://suttacentral.net/an2.32-41)
[2.23 reprises the theme that one who distorts the teaching misrep-](https://suttacentral.net/an2.21-31)
resents the Buddha and contributes to the ending of Buddhism.
This applies to those who claim that things were spoken by the
Buddha when they were not.

[AN 2.24 introduces the contrast between the discourses that](https://suttacentral.net/an2.21-31)
require interpretation (neyyattha) and those whose meaning is ex[plicit (nītattha). In some suttas (eg. MN 133), we find that the](https://suttacentral.net/mn133)
Buddha gives a brief statement which the mendicants do not understand, sothey seek adviceon how to interpretit. In other casesa
verse or doctrinal statement is unclear and the mendicants discuss
it. These examples show that the process of discussion and analysis
of the Buddha’s teaching was underway from the very beginning.
This process was eventually to be formalized as the various sets of
Abhidhamma texts and spelled out in the commentaries. But these
later texts did not yet exist, and should not be read back into the
suttas.

[AN 2.31 reintroduces another of the themes of the first nipāta:](https://suttacentral.net/an2.21-31)
meditation. The pair of serenity (samatha) and discernment (or
“insight”, vipassanā) are said to play a part in realization: serenity
develops the mind, while vipassanā develops wisdom. Together
they lead to the two aspects of awakening: the freedom of heart
and the freedom by wisdom.
But this is, for the moment, an isolated text, for the next series
of texts returns to the theme of persons. This theme was briefly
[introduced earlier, when AN 2.2 contrasted the efforts of lay folk](https://suttacentral.net/an2.1-10)
[and renunciants. AN 2.32 says that a good person knows gratitude,](https://suttacentral.net/an2.32-41)
[while the bad one does not. AN 2.33 speaks of the strongest and](https://suttacentral.net/an2.32-41)
most emotional ties of gratitude, those of a child to their parents.
The Buddha says that even by carrying your parents around for
the rest of their lives, feeding and cleaning them, you cannot repay
them the gift of life. Only by establishing them in the principles of
the Dhamma can you repay them. The theme of respect for parents
[is further developed in AN 3.31.](https://suttacentral.net/an3.31)
[In AN 2.35 the Buddha tells a brahmin that the traditional re-](https://suttacentral.net/an2.32-41)
ligious donation (dakkhiṇa) is owed to those who are purified, that
is, the trainee and master on the path. These replace the sacrifice
of the brahmins. Next follow some teachings by disciples, in which
[both Sāriputta (AN 2.36) and Mahākaccāna (AN 2.38) make a](https://suttacentral.net/an2.32-41)
distinction between inner and outer practice, while Mahākaccāna
makes a shrewd observation: householders argue about sensual
[pleasures, but renunciants argue over views (AN 2.37). In AN 2.39](https://suttacentral.net/an2.32-41)
the Buddha makes a rather biting comparison between a kingdom
overrun with bandits and a Saṅgha where the good mendicants are
[weak, cowed into silence. The following chapter (AN 2.42–51)](https://suttacentral.net/an2.42-51)
expands on this by contrasting good and bad assemblies.
From assemblies as groups of people, the text revisits yet another theme of the first nipāta: the Buddha as the supreme person.
Here he is paired with his worldly counterpart, the wheel-turning
[emperor (AN 2.52–55). Continuing with the theme of kinds of](https://suttacentral.net/an2.52-63)
[people, AN 2.62 and AN 2.63 describe procedures in the Saṅgha](https://suttacentral.net/an2.52-63)
for settling disputes and living harmoniously.
The next chapter is tightly constructed on the subject of happiness (sukha). It introduces the topic by contrasting the happiness
of lay people and that of renunciants, of which the latter is bet[ter (AN 2.64). This continues the theme of persons, specifically](https://suttacentral.net/an2.64-76)
the contrast between lay folk and renunciants, which was already
stated in the second text of the nipāta. Here it is combined with
the topic of happiness, which is new. A series of suttas expands
on this theme, but it uses a thematic segue to move away from the
focus on persons and speak of happiness in purely psychological
terms more reminiscent of the Saṁyutta.
This chapter itself forms another segue—a nested segue if you
will—to the next series of chapters, the unifying characteristic
being the tight integration of short suttas on a single pattern in a
_vagga, returning to the kind of “vagga as sutta” that we saw in the_
Book of the Ones. Chapter 8 deals with the causes for good and
bad qualities; Chapter 9 deals with various miscellaneous pairs of
“things” (dhammā); Chapter 10 deals with the contrast between
the fool and the astute; and Chapter 11, while a little more diverse,
caps off this series.

[AN 2.130–AN 2.133 eulogize great disciples, reminding us of](https://suttacentral.net/an2.130-140)
the lists of the foremost disciples in the Book of the Ones. A few
discoursesthenrevisitthethemeofgoodandbadpeopleinheriting
[the results of their deeds (AN 2.134–AN 2.137). The remainder of](https://suttacentral.net/an2.130-140)
the nipāta lists a long series of pairs of contrasted qualities. Partic[ularly interesting is the series at AN 2.280–309 where the Buddha](https://suttacentral.net/an2.280-309)
gives the reasons for laying down rules for monastics. Normally
this is a list of ten reasons, but here they are arranged as pairs. The
final series speaks of developing deep understanding and letting
go through the pair of serenity and discernment. Thus, despite its
main focus on worldly ethics and results, the second nipāta, like
the first, ends with the practices leading to awakening.

##### The Book of the Threes

With this book we move on from the fragmentary assemblages of
the Book of the Ones and partly the Book of the Twos, and find
more conventionally unified suttas. Of course, this is never an absolute, as all the books of the Aṅguttara retain extensive repetition
series. Still, the focus from now is clearly on the whole sutta; and
as a consequence, the hand of the redactors is harder to discern.
Thatdoesnotmean, however, thatthereisadramaticbreakfrom
the first books. On the contrary, the Book of the Threes begins
with a thematic vagga that focuses on the familiar contrasting pair
of the fool and the astute. The number three is represented in the
qualitiesthataresaidtocharacterizethem. TheBālavagga(Chapter
on the Fool) corresponds to the similarly-named third and tenth
chapters of the Twos, as well as the second chapter of the Fives.
Like the Books of the Ones and Twos, this nipāta begins by
emphasizing the problematic situation that we are in, the tensions
and struggles of our worldly situation. The second vagga shifts
focus to what we can do about it.
[Thus in AN 3.13 we first see a clear example of the number three](https://suttacentral.net/an3.13)
as a worldly binary and a transcendent dimension that resolves the
contradiction. Thissuttaspeaksofonewithouthope—someoneafflicted by poverty and misery of station, as well as illness of body—
and a hopeful person, who looks to a bright future. But then there
is the one who has done away with hope: since they have achieved
their goal, there is nothing to look forward to.

[AN 3.14 makes an important political point: even the greatest](https://suttacentral.net/an3.14)
of rulers are subject to the rule of law (dhamma). Here the relevant
group of three is action by body, speech, and mind. This triad—
which is pre-Buddhist—expresses one of the fundamental principles of the Dhamma, the focus on ethical choices and good deeds.
It is found constantly throughout the Threes. Whereas a worldly
philosophy might take into consideration only a person’s external
acts of body and speech, for Buddhism the mind is always the most
important. It is the mind that is ultimately responsible for what we
do and say, and it is through the mind that freedom is found. Thus
the mind here points to the transcendent dimension of escape.
The next discourse continues with the threefold division of
body, speech, and mind, giving some practical advice as to how to
workfortheirproperdevelopment. ForthefirsttimetheAṅguttara
ventures into narrative. It tells the story of a chariot maker of the
past, who was commissioned by the king to make a new war chariot
for a battle in six months. This is a rather striking setup: the scale
of society is so small that it is unremarkable for a king to personally
speak to a chariot-maker. And apparently, a single chariot is an
adequate military build-up for war; a war that is, politely enough,
scheduled precisely six months in advance. The small scale and
low stakes of this charming story are a strong contrast with the
elaborate and fanciful legends of the Dīgha.
The chariot-maker completes the first wheel only six days before
thebattleandisurgedtorushthesecondone. Buttimematters: the
first wheel is well-formed and stable, while the second wobbles and
crashes. TheBuddhathengoesontoidentifyhimselfasthechariotmaker. This too is remarkable, as it is one of the very few Jātaka
stories in the four nikāyas. The Buddha-to-be’s humble station
as a lowly chariot-maker is unusual, as usually he is said to be a
great king of the past. It’s also noteworthy that his commission is
morally dubious: he is an arms manufacturer. Later the Aṅguttara
will say that trade in arms is one of the forms of wrong livelihood
[(AN 5.177). One might argue that a chariot is not a weapon, but](https://suttacentral.net/an5.177)
it is explicitly required as a war vehicle, and today we would not
hesitate to count, say, tanks or fighter jets as weapons platforms. In
the later Jātaka collection, it is not unusual for the Bodhisatta to
break precepts or commit various acts of dubious morality; after
all, the whole point is that he is not yet perfect. Still, this adds to
the striking impression of this little tale, so much more down to
earth and realistic than the other Jātakas in the nikāyas.

[AN 3.16 introduces the idea of the “guaranteed practice”, which](https://suttacentral.net/an3.16)
consists of three of the elements of the Gradual Training: sense
restraint, eating in moderation, and wakefulness. These implicitly
call back to the very first chapter of the Aṅguttara, here presented
in a more standard form.
One of the Aṅguttara’s characteristic rhetorical devices is to con[trast the worldly with the sacred; remember how AN 2.2 spoke](https://suttacentral.net/an2.1-10)
[of the efforts of the lay and the renunciant. AN 3.19 expands this](https://suttacentral.net/an3.19)
theme, comparing a shopkeeper who must work morning, noon,
andnightwithamendicantwhoappliesthemselvestotheirmedita[tionmorning,noon,andnight. AN3.20appliesthesamemetaphor](https://suttacentral.net/an3.20)
in a different way. These suttas cap off the first arc, which deals with
understanding the dangers of the world, and working to escape
from it.
The third chapter revisits the theme of persons . It begins with
a discussion among some senior mendicants regarding who is best
out of three kinds of spiritually attained person; or in other words,
who has best implemented the practice encouraged in the first two
[chapters (AN 3.21). An interesting comparison is made between](https://suttacentral.net/an3.21)
thetreatmentofillnessandprovidingspiritualassistance: youcan’t
[always help, but you should at least try (AN 3.22).](https://suttacentral.net/an3.22)
Several suttas in the Threes share a pattern where the first item is
a foundation, the second is the realization of the four noble truths,
[and the third is full awakening. This first appears at AN 3.12, and](https://suttacentral.net/an3.12)
[is applied in different ways in AN 3.24 and AN 3.25.](https://suttacentral.net/an3.24)
Returning to the theme of meditative immersion with which the
entire collection started, we are introduced to an intriguing teaching that reappears multiple times in the Aṅguttara, but nowhere
[else in the canon (AN 3.32, AN 10.6, AN 10.7, AN 11.7, AN](https://suttacentral.net/an3.32)
[11.18–AN 11.21). It begins with a question: could it be that a](https://suttacentral.net/an11.18)
mendicant might attain a state of immersion that is free of all ego
and conceit? Normally it is understood that the meditative absorptions are shared between ordinary people and enlightened beings
on the path. The perfected ones are distinguished by having let go
the cause of suffering, not because they have attained some special
state of meditation. But these suttas, with their striking note of
wonder, imply that there is a special meditative state attained only
by the perfected ones.
This discourse is also distinguished by the fact that it finishes
by quoting a verse currently included in the Sutta Nipāta and even
correctly names the chapter, the “The Way to the Beyond”. It is not
at all obvious that the verse was originally intended to refer to a
state of meditation. This shows that free and imaginative readings
of suttas were found even in the earliest times.
[Thenextdiscourse(AN3.33)continueswiththethemeofgoing](https://suttacentral.net/an3.33)
beyond ego and conceit, and it too quotes from “The Way to the
Beyond”. But it starts with the Buddha in what appears to be an
uncharacteristically despondent mood, saying that whether he
teaches in brief or in detail [harking back to AN 2.14](https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20) its hard
to find anyone who understands.

[AN3.35narratesapersonalencounterwithafellowbythename](https://suttacentral.net/an3.35)
of Hatthaka, who came across the Buddha meditating near his
hometown of Āḷavī. He asks if the Buddha slept well, considering
the harshness of his outdoor living. The Buddha replies that he is
one of those who sleep well in the world, as he is rid of the greed,
hate, and delusion that disturb people in their sleep.
This is the second time this classic triad appears in the Threes.
[They first appeared in the previous sutta, AN 3.34, as the source](https://suttacentral.net/an3.34)
of deeds, and will recur in this sense in multiple suttas in this ni_pāta. Like the triad of body, speech, and mind, they can be seen_
to exemplify the 2 + 1 pattern. Greed and hate are a codependent
pair, the ugly opposites. Delusion underlies them both; but at the
same time, the counterpart of delusion is wisdom, and it is through
wisdom that transcendence is possible.
This narrative mood ventures into mythology in the next discourse, which gives the Buddhist account of the god Yama, lord
of the dead. While one might expect a death god to be fearsome,
here he takes a decidedly Buddhist approach to the afterlife. When
the departed are brought to Yama, he neither judges nor punishes.
Rather, he asks the departed whether he took heed of the messengers sent by the gods: an old person, a sick person, and a corpse.
These, of course, are three of the four divine messengers seen by
the Bodhisattva before he went forth (canonically found in the life
[of Vipassī; see DN 14). When the departed one replies that he](https://suttacentral.net/dn14)
took no heed, Yama castigates him for his negligence and then falls
silent. The departed is dragged off to endure the sufferings of hell,
[here recounted in a briefer form than MN 129 and MN 130. Yama](https://suttacentral.net/mn129)
goes on to lament the pitiful state of mortals, including himself and
wishes he could be reborn as a human and practice Buddhism.
The mythological mood continues in the next couple of suttas
[(AN 3.37, AN 3.38), which introduce a new topic that will be very](https://suttacentral.net/an3.37)
important for the Aṅguttara; namely, the uposatha or “sabbath”.
This was a special “holy day” for religious observance observed
weekly or on certain special days. The ministers of the Four Great
Kings survey the earth on such days to see if people are honoring
theirbetters anddoinggood. Ifthey are, theyrejoice, for they know
that such people will be reborn in heaven to swell the hosts of the
gods, whereas if they are not they fear the hosts of the demons will
increase. This will of course have serious military implications in
the ongoing war between the two.
The next couple of suttas deal with renunciation, first as the Bud[dha’s recollection of his delicate upbringing (AN 3.39), then as a](https://suttacentral.net/an3.39)
reflection for how a renunciate is to reflect with integrity on their
[choices (AN 3.40). AN 3.41 and AN 3.42 look at the other side of](https://suttacentral.net/an3.40)
the coin, the qualities that make merit for a lay donor, especially
faith and generosity as well as the desire to learn. Learning is taken
[up as the theme of the next two suttas (AN 3.43 and AN 3.44).](https://suttacentral.net/an3.43)
Then the themes of generosity, faith, and the worthy spiritual life
[that make merit fruitful are revisited (AN 3.45, AN 3.46, AN 3.48).](https://suttacentral.net/an3.45)
[Mendicants are then urged to be diligent (AN 3.49) and the na-](https://suttacentral.net/an3.49)
[ture of bad mendicants is disclosed (AN 3.50). Taken together,](https://suttacentral.net/an3.50)
this series of 12 suttas can be read as a small thematic arc on the
relation between lay folk and renunciants, the need for both to
have integrity and the proper sense of values in their sphere, and
the mutual support of each other through generosity with material
things and of teachings.
Next begins a new vagga, “On Brahmins”, which as one might
[expect, depicts the Buddha in conversation with brahmins. In AN](https://suttacentral.net/an3.51)
[3.51 and AN 3.52, the Buddha is approached by two brahmins,](https://suttacentral.net/an3.51)
who confess that they have not lived a good life, and now, in their
dotage, seek for help. The Buddha acknowledges the brevity of
[life and urges restraint of body, speech, and mind. AN 3.53 has](https://suttacentral.net/an3.53)
the Buddha speaking to another brahmin on how the Dhamma
is to be realized in this very life. He gives a similar teaching to a
[wanderer (AN 3.54) and to the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi (AN 3.55).](https://suttacentral.net/an3.54)
That the Buddha’s teaching may be realized in this life is a stock
characteristic of the Dhamma (sandiṭṭhiko akāliko), but it is easy
to overlook how directly this was a rebuke of pre-existing religious
traditions. They looked forward to rewards in the future whether
a heavenly rebirth or the eventual annihilation of suffering—but
the Buddha, while not denying the reality and importance of future
fruits, refocused spiritual life on the present.

[AN 3.56 gives a different kind of teaching to a brahmin. In a](https://suttacentral.net/an3.56)
message with a special poignancy in our troubled times, the Buddha explains why civilizations collapse, namely, unbridled greed.
[In AN 3.57 the Buddha refutes the wanderer Vacchagotta’s accu-](https://suttacentral.net/an3.57)
sation that he only encourages giving to his followers. When the
brahmin Tikaṇṇa (“Three-ear”) praises true brahmins, the Buddha
responds with his redefinition of a brahmin, rejecting the value of
birth and Vedic learning, and giving the second part of the Grad[ual Training, starting with the absorptions (AN 3.58; AN 3.59 is](https://suttacentral.net/an3.58)
[similar). In AN 3.60, the Buddha not only rejects the value of the](https://suttacentral.net/an3.60)
Vedic sacrifice, but he also shows that by teaching Dhamma one
can benefit many more people.
The seventh vagga is titled the “Great Chapter”, and it introduces a series of discourses on a larger scale. It begins with a the[matic segue; AN 3.61 continues the theme of the relation between](https://suttacentral.net/an3.61)
Buddhist and non-Buddhist theories, but it does so as a straight
doctrinal discourse to the mendicants, rather than as an interfaith
dialogue. This magnificent discourse offers an important framing
of dependent origination and it deserves detailed study. This Great
Chapter is unified by the length of the sutta rather than by subject;
however several other suttas deal with non-Buddhist philosophy
[and relations (AN 3.64, AN 3.68, AN 3.70), including the famous](https://suttacentral.net/an3.64)
[Kālāma Sutta (AN 3.65; also AN 3.66).](https://suttacentral.net/an3.65)
Here I will end my analysis, as I think enough examples have
been given to illustrate both the connectedness and the chaos of
this collection. Hopefully, the reader can find their way from here,
and not feel so bewildered by the sudden shifts and changes they
encounter.
##### A Brief Textual History

The Aṅguttara Nikāya was edited by R. Morris (vols. 1 and
2) and E. Hardy (vols 3–5) based on manuscripts in Sinhalese
and Burmese scripts; Hardy also made use of the then recentlypublished royal Thai edition. It was published in Latin script by
the Pali Text Society from 1885 to 1900. Indexes by M. Hunt and
Mrs. C.A.F. Rhys Davids were added in 1910. The first translation
followed in 1932–36 by F.L. Woodward (vols. 1, 2, and 5) and
E.M. Hare (vols. 3 and 4) under the title The Book of the Gradual
_Sayings._
As was the case with the Majjhima and Saṁyutta, several disparate individual suttas from the Aṅguttara were published in book
form or the web. However, a complete new translation had to wait
for Bhikkhu Bodhi to complete his work on the Saṁyutta Nikāya.
As describedin the introduction to his translation, in the late1990s
Bhikkhu Bodhi collected Nyanaponika Thera’s four-part series of
Wheel booklets into a single volume for the International Sacred
Literature Trust as An Aṅguttara Nikāya Anthology. He then added
sixty more suttas and published a total of 208 suttas as The Nu_merical Discourses of the Buddha: An Anthology of Suttas from the_
_Aṅguttara Nikāya with AltaMira Press in 1999. In 2012 he com-_
pleted the full translation, which was published as The Numerical
_Discourses of the Buddha through Wisdom Publications. His In-_
troduction was even more extensive than his previous works; less
technical than the Saṁyutta introduction, the bulk of it focused on
an overview of the teachings found in the Aṅguttara. As with his
previous translations, this work constituted a major leap forward
in accuracy and readability, introducing the Aṅguttara to a new
generation.
Where the Pali was unclear I frequently referred to the earlier
work of Bodhi, and rarely to Woodward/Hare and various translations of specific texts. An article by Tse-fu Kuan (關則富)—
_Some Reflections on Translating the Pali Texts: Literary Conventions,_
_Buddhist Thought, Cultural Background and Textual History, 2019,_
Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae, vol. 72 (1),
pp. 1–23—provided helpful corrections in several passages.

# Four Chapters on One Thing

AN 1.296–305

_Paṭhamavagga_

###### 296

“One thing, mendicants, when developed and cultivated, leads 1.1
solely to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight,
awakening, and extinguishment. What one thing? Recollection
of the Buddha. This one thing, when developed and cultivated,
leads solely to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.”

###### 297–305

“One thing, mendicants, when developed and cultivated, leads 1.1
solely to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight,
awakening, and extinguishment. What one thing? Recollection of
the teaching … Recollection of the Saṅgha … Recollection of ethical conduct … Recollection of generosity … Recollection of the
deities … Mindfulness of breathing … Mindfulness of death …
Mindfulness of the body … Recollection of peace. This one thing,
when developed and cultivated, leads solely to disillusionment,
dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.”
AN 1.306 315

_Dutiyavagga_

###### 306

1.1 “Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to unskillful
qualities, or, when they have arisen, makes them increase and grow
like wrong view. When you have wrong view, unskillful qualities
arise or, when they have arisen, they increase and grow.”

###### 307

1.1 “Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to skillful
qualities, or, when they have arisen, makes them increase and grow
likerightview. Whenyouhaverightview, unarisenskillfulqualities
arise or, when they have arisen, they increase and grow.”

###### 308

1.1 “Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to unskillful
qualities, or makes skillful qualities decline like wrong view. When
you have wrong view, unskillful qualities arise and skillful qualities
decline.”

###### 309

1.1 “Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to skillful
qualities,ormakesunskillfulqualitiesdeclinelikerightview. When
you have right view, skillful qualities arise and unskillful qualities
decline.”

###### 310

1.1 “Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to wrong
view, and once arisen, makes it grow like irrational application of
mind. When you apply the mind irrationally, wrong view arises,
and once arisen it grows.”
###### 311

“Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to right view, 1.1
or, once it has already arisen, makes it grow like rational application
of mind. When you apply the mind rationally, right view arises,
and once arisen it grows.”

###### 312

“Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that causes sentient beings 1.1
to be reborn, when their body breaks up, after death, in a place
of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell like wrong view. It is
because they have wrong view that sentient beings, when their
body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad
place, the underworld, hell.”

###### 313

“Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that causes sentient beings 1.1
to be reborn, when their body breaks up, after death, in a good
place, a heavenly realm like right view. It is because they have right
view that sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death,
are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.”

###### 314

“Mendicants, when an individual has wrong view, whatever bodily, 1.1
verbal, or mental deeds they undertake in line with that view, their
intentions, aims, wishes, and choices all lead to what is unlikable,
undesirable, disagreeable, harmful, and suffering. Why is that?
Because their view is bad. Suppose a seed of neem, angled gourd,
or bitter gourd was planted in moist earth. Whatever nutrients it
takes up from the earth and water would lead to its bitter, acerbic,
and unpleasant taste. Why is that? Because the seed is bad. In the
same way, when an individual has wrong view, whatever bodily,
verbal, or mental deeds they undertake in line with that view, their
intentions, aims, wishes, and choices all lead to what is unlikable,
undesirable, disagreeable, harmful, and suffering. Why is that?
Because their view is bad.”

###### 315

1.1 “Mendicants, when an individual has right view, whatever bodily,
verbal, or mental deeds they undertake in line with that view, their
intentions, aims, wishes, and choices all lead to what is likable,
desirable, agreeable, beneficial, and pleasant. Why is that? Because
their view is good. Suppose a seed of sugar cane, fine rice, or grape
was planted in moist earth. Whatever nutrients it takes up from
the earth and water would lead to its sweet, pleasant, and delicious
taste. Whyisthat? Becausetheseedisgood. Inthesameway, when
an individual has right view, whatever bodily, verbal, or mental
deeds they undertake in line with that view, their intentions, aims,
wishes, and choices all lead to what is likable, desirable, agreeable,
beneficial, and pleasant. Why is that? Because their view is good.”

AN 1.316–332

_Tatiyavagga_

###### 316

1.1 “One person, mendicants, arises in the world for the detriment and
suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm, detriment,
and suffering of gods and humans. What one person? Someone
with wrong view, whose perspective is distorted. They draw many
people away from the true teaching and establish them in false
teachings. This is one person who arises in the world for the detriment and suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm,
detriment, and suffering of gods and humans.”

###### 317

1.1 “One person, mendicants, arises in the world for the welfare and
happiness of the people, for the people, for the benefit, welfare,
and happiness of gods and humans. What one person? Someone
with right view, whose perspective is undistorted. They draw many
people away from false teachings and establish them in the true
teaching. This is one person who arises in the world for the welfare
and happiness of the people, for the people, for the benefit, welfare,
and happiness of gods and humans.”

###### 318

“Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that is so very blameworthy 1.1
as wrong view. Wrong view is the most blameworthy thing of all.”

###### 319

“Mendicants, I do not see a single other person who acts for the 1.1
detriment and suffering of the people, against the people, for the
harm, detriment, and suffering of gods and humans, as that futile
man, the bamboo-staffed ascetic. Just as a trap set at the mouth
of a river would bring harm, suffering, calamity, and disaster for
many fish, so too that futile man, the bamboo-staffed ascetic, is a
trap for humans, it seems to me. He has arisen in the world for the
harm, suffering, calamity, and disaster of many beings.”

###### 320

“Mendicants, the one who encourages someone in a poorly ex- 1.1
plained teaching and training, the one who they encourage, and the
one who practices accordingly all create much wickedness. Why is
that? Because the teaching is poorly explained.”

###### 321

“Mendicants, the one who encourages someone in a well explained 1.1
teaching and training, the one who they encourage, and the one
who practices accordingly all create much merit. Why is that?
Because the teaching is well explained.”
###### 322

1.1 “Mendicants, in a poorly explained teaching and training, the donor
should know moderation, not the recipient. Why is that? Because
the teaching is poorly explained.”

###### 323

1.1 “Mendicants, in a well explained teaching and training, the recipient
should know moderation, not the donor. Why is that? Because
the teaching is well explained.”

###### 324

1.1 “Mendicants, in a poorly explained teaching and training an energetic person lives in suffering. Why is that? Because the teaching
is poorly explained.”

###### 325

1.1 “Mendicants, in a well explained teaching and training a lazy person lives in suffering. Why is that? Because the teaching is well
explained.”

###### 326

1.1 “Mendicants, in a poorly explained teaching and training a lazy
person lives happily. Why is that? Because the teaching is poorly
explained.”

###### 327

1.1 “Mendicants, in a well explained teaching and training an energetic
person lives happily. Why is that? Because the teaching is well
explained.”
###### 328

“Just as, mendicants, even a tiny bit of fecal matter still stinks, so too 1.1
I don’t approve of even a tiny bit of continued existence, not even
as long as a finger-snap.”

###### 329–332

“Just as even a tiny bit of urine, or spit, or pus, or blood still stinks, 1.1
so too I don’t approve of even a tiny bit of continued existence, not
even as long as a finger-snap.”

AN 1.333–377

_Catutthavagga_

###### 333

“Just as, mendicants, in the Black Plum Tree Land the delightful 1.1

teachings they have memorized are few, while those who don’t
examine the meaning of the teachings are many.
###### 342

… so too the sentient beings who understand the meaning and the 1.1
teaching and practice accordingly are few, while those who understand the meaning and the teaching but don’t practice accordingly
are many.

###### 343

… so too the sentient beings inspired by inspiring places are few, 1.1
while those who are uninspired are many.

###### 344

… so too the sentient beings who, being inspired, strive effectively 1.1
are few, while those who, even though inspired, don’t strive effectively are many.

###### 345

… so too the sentient beings who, relying on letting go, gain im- 1.1
mersion, gain unification of mind are few, while those who don’t
gain immersion, don’t gain unification of mind relying on letting
go are many.

###### 346

… so too the sentient beings who get the best food and flavors are 1.1
few, while those who don’t get the best food and flavors, but get by
with scraps in an alms bowl are many.

###### 347

… so too the sentient beings who get the essence of the meaning, 1.1
the essence of the teaching, and the essence of freedom are few,
while the sentient beings who don’t get the essence of the meaning,
the essence of the teaching, and the essence of freedom are many.
1.3 So you should train like this: We will get the essence of the
meaning, the essence of the teaching, the essence of freedom.’
That’s how you should train.”

long as a finger-snap, they are called a mendicant who does not lack
absorption, who follows the Teacher’s instructions, who responds

much more so those who make much of it!”

# The Book of the Twos

# The Chapter on Punishments

AN 2.1–10

_Kammakaraṇavagga_

###### 1. Faults

1.1 So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the
Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”
1.5 “Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:
2.1 “There are, mendicants, these two faults. What two? The fault
apparent in this life, and the fault to do with lives to come.
2.4 What is the fault apparent in this life? It’s when someone sees
that kings have arrested a bandit, a criminal, and subjected them
to various punishments—whipping, caning, and clubbing; cutting
off hands or feet, or both; cutting off ears or nose, or both; the
‘porridge pot’, the ‘shell-shave’, the ‘Rāhu’s mouth’, the ‘garland of
fire’, the ‘burning hand’, the ‘bulrush twist’, the ‘bark dress’, the ‘antelope’, the ‘meat hook’, the ‘coins’, the ‘caustic pickle’, the ‘twisting
bar’, the ‘straw mat’; being splashed with hot oil, being fed to the
dogs, being impaled alive, and being beheaded.
3.1 It occurs to them: ‘If I were to commit the kinds of bad deeds
for which the kings arrested that bandit, that criminal, the rulers
would arrest me and subject me to the same punishments. Afraid
of the fault apparent in this life, they do not steal the belongings of
others. This is called the fault apparent in this life.
What is the fault to do with lives to come? It’s when someone 4.1
reflects: ‘Bad conduct of body, speech, or mind has a bad, painful
result in the next life. If I conduct myself badly, then, when my
body breaks up, after death, won’t I be reborn in a place of loss,
a bad place, the underworld, hell?’ Afraid of the fault to do with
lives to come, they give up bad conduct by way of body, speech,
and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and
mind, keeping themselves pure. This is called the fault to do with
lives to come.
These are the two faults. 4.8
So you should train like this: ‘We will fear the fault apparent in 4.9
this life, and we will fear the fault to do with lives to come. We will
fear faults, seeing the danger in faults.’ That’s how you should train.
If you fear faults, seeing the danger in faults, you can expect to be
freed from all faults.”

###### 2. Endeavor

“These two endeavors are challenging in the world. What two? 1.1
The endeavor of laypeople staying in a home to provide robes,
almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. And
the endeavor of those gone forth from the lay life to homelessness
to let go of all attachments. These are the two endeavors that are
challenging in the world.
The better of these two endeavors is the effort to let go of all 2.1
attachments.
So you should train like this: ‘We shall endeavor to let go of all 2.2
attachments.’ That’s how you should train.”

###### 3. Mortifying

“These two things, mendicants, are mortifying. What two? It’s 1.1
when someone has done bad things and not done good things, by
way of body, speech, and mind. Thinking, ‘I’ve done bad things
by way of body, speech, and mind, they re mortified. Thinking, I
haven’tdonegoodthingsbywayofbody, speech, andmind’, they’re
mortified. These are the two things that are mortifying.”

###### 4. Not Mortifying

1.1 “These two things, mendicants, are not mortifying. What two? It’s
when someone has done good things and not done bad things, by
way of body, speech, and mind. Thinking, ‘I’ve done good things
by way of body, speech, and mind’, they’re not mortified. Thinking,
‘Ihaven’tdonebadthingsbywayofbody, speech, andmind’, they’re
not mortified. These are the two things that are not mortifying.”

###### 5. Learned for Myself

1.1 “Mendicants, I have learned these two things for myself—to never
be content with skillful qualities, and to never stop trying.
1.3 I never stopped trying, thinking: ‘Gladly, let only skin, sinews,
and bones remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body!
I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by
human strength, energy, and vigor.’
1.5 It was by diligence that I achieved awakening, and by diligence
that I achieved the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.
1.6 If you too never stop trying, thinking: ‘Gladly, let only skin,
sinews, and bones remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away
in my body! I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is
possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.’ You will soon
realize the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very
life. You will live having achieved with your own insight the goalfor
which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
1.9 So you should train like this: ‘We will never stop trying, thinking: “Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and bones remain! Let the flesh
and blood waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have
achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.”’
That’s how you should train.”
###### 6. Fetters

“There are, mendicants, these two things. What two? Seeing things 1.1
that are prone to being fettered as gratifying, and seeing things that
are prone to being fettered as boring. When you keep seeing things
that are prone to being fettered as gratifying, you don’t give up
greed, hate, and delusion. When these are not given up, you’re not
freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation,
pain, sadness, and distress. You’re not freed from suffering, I say.
When you keep seeing things that are prone to being fettered 2.1
as boring, you give up greed, hate, and delusion. When these
are given up, you’re freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from
sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. You’re freed from
suffering, I say. These are the two things.”

###### 7. Dark

“These two things, mendicants, are dark. What two? Lack of con- 1.1
science and prudence. These are the two things that are dark.”

###### 8. Bright

“These two things, mendicants, are bright. What two? Conscience 1.1
and prudence. These are the two things that are bright.”

###### 9. Conduct

“These two bright things, mendicants, protect the world. What 1.1
two? Conscience and prudence. If these two bright things did not
protect the world, there would be no recognition of the status of
mother,aunts,orwivesandpartnersoftutorsandrespectedpeople.
The world would become dissolute, like goats and sheep, chickens
and pigs, and dogs and jackals. But because the two bright things
protect the world, there is recognition of the status of mother,
aunts, and wives and partners of tutors and respected people.”
###### 10. Entering the Rainy Season

1.1 “There are, mendicants, these two entries to the rainy season. What
two? Earlier and later. These are the two entries to the rainy season.”

“There are, mendicants, these two powers. What two? The power of 1.1
reflectionandthepowerofdevelopment. Andwhat, mendicants, is
the power of reflection? It’s when someone reflects: ‘Bad conduct
of body, speech, or mind has a bad, painful result in both this life
and the next.’ Reflecting like this, they give up bad conduct by way
of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of
body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure. This is called
the power of reflection.
And what, mendicants, is the power of development? In this 2.1
context, the power of development is the power of the trainees. For
when you rely on the power of a trainee, you give up greed, hate,
and delusion. Then you don’t do anything unskillful, or practice
anything bad. This is called the power of development. These are
the two powers.”

“There are, mendicants, these two powers. What two? The power of 1.1

body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure. This is called
the power of reflection.
2.1 And what, mendicants, is the power of development? It’s when
a mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion,
and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. This is called the power of development. These are the two powers.”

body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure. This is called
the power of reflection.
2.1 And what, mendicants, is the power of development? It’s when
a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption,
which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the
mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and
keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the secondabsorption, whichhastheraptureandblissbornofimmersion,
with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind
and keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture,
they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate
with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the
bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful,
one meditates in bliss. Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending
former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth
absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and
mindfulness. This is called the power of development. These are
the two powers.”

“Mendicants, the Realized One has two ways of teaching the 1.1
Dhamma. What two? In brief and in detail. These are the Realized One’s two ways of teaching the Dhamma.”

###### 15

“Mendicants, in a disciplinary issue, if neither the offending men- 1.1
dicant nor the accusing mendicant carefully checks themselves,
you can expect that issue will lead to lasting acrimony and enmity,
and the mendicants won’t live comfortably. But in a disciplinary
issue, if both the offending mendicant and the accusing mendicant carefully check themselves, you can expect that issue won’t
lead to lasting acrimony and enmity, and the mendicants will live
comfortably.
And how, mendicants, does an offending mendicant carefully 2.1
check themselves? An offending mendicant reflects: ‘I have committed a certain unskillful offense with the body. That mendicant
saw me do this. If I hadn’t committed that offense, they wouldn’t
have seen me. But since I did commit that offense, they did see
me. When they saw me, they were upset, and they voiced their
unhappiness to me. Then I also got upset, so I told others. So
the mistake is mine alone, like someone who owes customs duty
on their goods.’ That’s how, mendicants, an offending mendicant
carefully checks themselves.
And how, mendicants, does an accusing mendicant carefully 3.1
check themselves? An accusing mendicant reflects: ‘This mendicant has committed a certain unskillful offense with the body. I
saw them do that. If they hadn’t committed that offense, I wouldn’t
have seen them. But since they did commit that offense, I did see
them. When I saw them, I was upset, and I voiced my unhappiness
to them. Then they also got upset, so they told others. So the mistake is mine alone, like someone who owes customs duty on their
goods.’ That’s how, mendicants, an accusing mendicant carefully
checks themselves.
4.1 In adisciplinaryissue, ifneithertheoffendingmendicantnorthe
accusing mendicant carefully checks themselves, you can expect
that issue will lead to lasting acrimony and enmity, and the mendicants won’t live comfortably. But in a disciplinary issue, if both
the offending mendicant and the accusing mendicant carefully
checks themselves, you can expect that issue won’t lead to lasting
acrimony and enmity, and the mendicants will live comfortably.”

1.1 Then a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha and exchanged

3.1 “Excellent, Mister Gotama! Excellent! As if he was righting the
overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to
the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes
can see what’s there, Mister Gotama has made the teaching clear in
many ways. I go for refuge to Mister Gotama, to the teaching, and

“But what is the cause, Mister Gotama, what is the reason why 1.6

reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm?”
“What they’ve done and what they’ve not done. That’s why 1.7
some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are
reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.”
“I don’t understand the meaning of what Mister Gotama has 1.9
said in brief, without explaining the details. Mister Gotama, please
teach me this matter in detail so I can understand the meaning.”
“Well then, brahmin, listen and apply your mind well, I will 1.11

“Yes sir,” Jānussoṇi replied. The Buddha said this: 1.12

reputation. They feel lost when they die. And when their body
breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place,
the underworld, hell. These are the drawbacks they should expect.”
2.1 “Ānanda, I absolutely say that you should do good things by way
of body, speech, and mind.”
2.2 “But, sir, if someone does these things that should be done, what
benefits should they expect?”

heavenly realm. These are the benefits they should expect.”

1.1 “Mendicants, give up the unskillful. It is possible to give up the unskillful. If it wasn’t possible, I wouldn’t say: ‘Give up the unskillful.’
But it is possible, and so I say: ‘Give up the unskillful.’ And if giving
up the unskillful led to harm and suffering, I would not say: ‘Give

# The Chapter on the Peaceful Mind

AN 2.32–41

_Samacittavagga_

###### 32

“Mendicants, I will teach you the level of the untrue person and the 1.1
level of the true person. Listen and apply your mind well, I will
speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 1.3
“What is the level of the untrue person? The untrue person is 2.1
ungrateful and thankless, for the wicked only know how to be ungrateful and thankless. It is totally the level of an untrue person to
be ungrateful and thankless. The true person is grateful and thankful, for the virtuous only know how to be grateful and thankful. It
is totally the level of a true person to be grateful and thankful.”

###### 33

“Mendicants, I say that these two people cannot easily be repaid. 1.1
What two? Mother and father.
You would not have done enough to repay your mother and fa- 1.4
ther even if you were to carry your mother around on one shoulder
and your father on the other, and if you lived like this for a hundred
years, and if you were to anoint, massage, bathe, and rub them; and
even if they were to defecate and urinate right there.
1.6 Even if you were to establish your mother and father as supreme
monarchs of this great earth, abounding in the seven treasures,
you would still not have done enough to repay them. Why is that?
Parents are very helpful to their children: they raise them, nurture
them, and show them the world.
1.9 But you have done enough, more than enough, to repay them
if you encourage, settle, and ground unfaithful parents in faith,
unethical parents in ethical conduct, stingy parents in generosity,
or ignorant parents in wisdom.”

###### 34

1.1 Then a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged
greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation
were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, “What
does Mister Gotama teach? What does he explain?”
1.3 “Brahmin, I teach action and inaction.”
1.4 “But in what way does Mister Gotama teach action and inaction?”
2.1 “I teach inaction regarding bad bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, and the many kinds of unskillful things. I teach action regarding good bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, and the many
kinds of skillful things. This is the kind of action and inaction that
I teach.”
3.1 “Excellent, Mister Gotama! … From this day forth, may Mister
Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge
for life.”

###### 35

1.1 Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha,
bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha, “How many
in the world are worthy of a religious donation? And where should
a gift be given?”
Householder, there are two in the world who are worthy of a 1.3
religious donation: the trainee and the adept. These two in the
world are worthy of a religious donation, and that’s where you
should give a gift.”
That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, 2.1
went on to say:

“In this world, the trainee and the adept, 3.1
are worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods.
They are sincere in body,
speech, and mind.
This is the field for sponsors of sacrifice—
what’s given here is very fruitful.”

###### 36

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near 1.1
Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī 1.3
in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery.
There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants: “Reverends, mendicants!”
“Reverend,” they replied. Sāriputta said this: 1.6
“I will teach you about a person fettered internally and one fet- 1.8
tered externally. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”
“Yes, reverend,” they replied. Sāriputta said this: 1.10
“Who is a person fettered internally? It’s a mendicant who is 2.1
ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves
well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the
slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. When their
body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in one of the orders of
gods. When they pass away from there, they’re a returner, who
comes back to this place. This is called a person who is fettered
internally, a returner, who comes back to this place.
Who is a person fettered externally? It’s a mendicant who is 3.1
ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves
well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the
slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. They enter
and remain in a certain peaceful state of freed mind. When their
body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in one of the orders of
gods. When they pass away from there, they’re a non-returner, not
coming back to this place. This is called a person who is fettered
externally, a non-returner, who does not come back to this place.
4.1 Furthermore, a mendicant is ethical … they keep the rules
they’ve undertaken. They simply practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding sensual pleasures. They simply
practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding
future lives. They practice for the ending of craving. They practice
for the ending of greed. When their body breaks up, after death,
they are reborn in one of the orders of gods. When they pass away
from there, they are non-returners, not coming back to this place.
This is called a person who is fettered externally, a non-returner,
who does not come back to this place.”
5.1 Then several peaceful-minded deities went up to the Buddha,
bowed, stood to one side, and said to the Buddha, “Sir, Venerable
Sāriputta is in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern
Monastery, where he is teaching the mendicants about a person
with internal fetters and one with external fetters. The assembly is
overjoyed! Sir, please go to Venerable Sāriputta out of sympathy.”
The Buddha consented with silence.
5.6 Then the Buddha, as easily as a strong person would extend or
contract their arm, vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in
the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery, in
front of Sāriputta. He sat on the seat spread out. Sāriputta bowed
to the Buddha and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:
6.1 “Just now, Sāriputta, several peaceful-minded deities came up
to me, bowed, and stood to one side. Those deities said to me: ‘Sir,
Venerable Sāriputta is in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in
the Eastern Monastery, where he is teaching the mendicants about
a person with internal fetters and one with external fetters. The
assembly is overjoyed! Sir, please go to Venerable Sāriputta out of
sympathy.’
Those deities, though they number ten, twenty, thirty, forty, 6.5
fifty, or sixty, can stand on the point of a needle without bumping
up against each other.
Sāriputta, you might think: ‘Surely those deities, since so many 6.6
of them can stand on the point of a needle without bumping up
against each other, must have developed their minds in that place.’
But you should not see it like this. It was right here that those
deities developed their minds.
So you should train like this: ‘We shall have peaceful faculties 6.10
and peaceful minds.’ That’s how you should train. When your
faculties and mind are peaceful, your acts of body, speech, and
mind will be peaceful, thinking: ‘We shall present the gift of peace
to our spiritual companions.’ That’s how you should train.
Those wanderers of other religions, Sāriputta, who have not 6.16
heard this exposition of the teaching are lost.”

###### 37

So I have heard. At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was 1.1
staying at Varaṇā, on the bank of the Kaddama Lake.
Then the brahmin Ārāmadaṇḍa went up to Mahākaccāna, and 1.3
exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite
conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Mahākaccāna:
“What is the cause, Mister Kaccāna, what is the reason why 1.5
aristocrats fight with aristocrats, brahmins fight with brahmins,
and householders fight with householders?”
“It is because of their insistence on sensual desire, their shack- 1.6
les, avarice, and attachment, that aristocrats fight with aristocrats,
brahmins fight with brahmins, and householders fight with householders.”
“What is the cause, Mister Kaccāna, what is the reason why 2.1
ascetics fight with ascetics?”
2.2 It is because of their insistence on views, their shackles, avarice,
and attachment, that ascetics fight with ascetics.”
3.1 “Mister Kaccāna, is there anyone in the world who has gone beyond the insistence on sensual desire and the insistence on views?”
3.2 “There is, brahmin.”
4.1 “Who in the world has gone beyond the insistence on sensual
desire and the insistence on views?”
4.2 “In the eastern lands there is a city called Sāvatthī. There the
Blessed One is now staying, the perfected one, the fully awakened
Buddha. He, brahmin, has gone beyond the insistence on sensual
desire and the insistence on views.”
5.1 When this was said, the brahmin Ārāmadaṇḍa got up from his
seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee,
raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and expressed this
heartfelt sentiment three times:
6.1 “Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!
7.1 Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!
8.1 Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!
9.1 He who has gone beyond the insistence on sensual desire and
the insistence on views.
10.1 Excellent, Mister Kaccāna! Excellent! As if he were righting the
overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to
the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes
can see what’s there, Mister Kaccāna has made the teaching clear
in many ways. I go for refuge to Mister Gotama, to the teaching,
and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Mister
Kaccāna remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge
for life.”
###### 38

At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying near Madhurā, in 1.1
Gunda’s Grove.
Then the brahmin Kandarāyana went up to Mahākaccāna, and 1.2
exchanged greetings with him … He sat down to one side and said
to Mahākaccāna:
“I have heard, Mister Kaccāna, that the ascetic Kaccāna doesn’t 1.3
bow to old brahmins, the elderly and senior, who are advanced in
years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in
their presence or offer them a seat. And this is indeed the case,
for the ascetic Kaccāna does not bow to old brahmins, elderly and
senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage
of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat. This
is not appropriate, Mister Kaccāna.”
“There is the stage of an elder and the stage of youth as explained 2.1
by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the
fully awakened Buddha. If an elder, though eighty, ninety, or a
hundred years old, still dwells in the midst of sensual pleasures,
enjoying them, consumed by thoughts of them, burning with fever
for them, and eagerly seeking more, they are reckoned as a child,
notasenior. Ifayouth, young, withpristineblackhair, blessedwith
youth, in the prime of life, does not dwell in the midst of sensual
pleasures, enjoying them, consumed by thoughts of them, burning
with fever for them, and eagerly seeking more, they are reckoned
as astute, a senior.”
When this was said, the brahmin Kandarāyana got up from his 3.1
seat, placed his robe over one shoulder, and bowed with his head at
the feet of the young mendicants, saying, “The good sirs are elders,
at the stage of the elder; we are youths, at the stage of youth.
Excellent, Mister Kaccāna! … From this day forth, may Mister 4.1
Kaccāna remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge
for life.”

1.1 “At a time when bandits are strong, kings are weak. Then the king
is not at ease when going out or coming back or when touring the
provinces. The brahmins and householders, likewise, are not at
ease when going out or coming back, or when inspecting their business activities. In the same way, at a time when bad mendicants are
strong, good-hearted mendicants are weak. Then the good-hearted
mendicants continually adhere to silence in the midst of the Saṅgha, or they stay in the borderlands. This is for the detriment and
suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm, detriment,
and suffering of gods and humans.

“Mendicants, by memorizing the discourses incorrectly, taking only 1.1
a semblance of the phrasing, some mendicants shut out the meaning and the teaching. They act for the detriment and suffering of
the people, against the people, for the harm, detriment, and suffering of gods and humans. They create much wickedness and make
the true teaching disappear.
But by memorizing the discourses well, not taking only a sem- 2.1
blance of the phrasing, some mendicants reinforce the meaning

and humans. They create much merit and make the true teaching
continue.”

And what is an assembly with principled speech? It is an as- 2.1
sembly where the mendicants take up disciplinary issues, whether
legitimate or not. Then they persuade each other or allow themselves to be persuaded, and they convince each other or allow
themselves to be convinced. Since they are able to persuade and
convince each other, they let go of their opinions. They don’t obstinately stick to that disciplinary issue or insist that: ‘This is the
only truth, anything else is futile.’ This is called an assembly with
principled speech. These are the two assemblies. The better of
these two assemblies is the assembly with principled speech.”

1.3 “Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:
2.1 “What is it like living with bad people? How do bad people live
together?
2.2 It’s when a senior mendicant thinks: ‘No mendicant, whether
senior, middle, or junior, should admonish me; and I shouldn’t
admonish any mendicant, whether senior, middle, or junior. If a
mendicant—whethersenior,middle,orjunior—weretoadmonish
me, they wouldn’t be sympathetic, and I’d bother them by saying
“No!” And anyway I wouldn’t deal with it even if I saw what I did
wrong.’
2.6 And a middle or a junior mendicant also thinks: ‘No mendicant,
whether senior, middle, or junior, should admonish me; and I
shouldn’t admonish any mendicant, whether senior, middle, or

Thats what its like living with bad people; thats how bad people 2.12
live together.
What is it like living with good people? How do good people 3.1
live together? It’s when a senior mendicant thinks:
‘Any mendicant, whether senior, middle, or junior, should ad- 3.3

admonish any mendicant, whether senior, middle, or junior. If a
mendicant—whether senior, middle, or junior—were to admonish me, they’d be sympathetic, so I wouldn’t bother them, but say

# The Chapter on Fools

AN 3.1
##### Perils

_Bhayasutta_

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near 1.1
Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the
Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 1.5
“Whatever dangersthereare, allcomefromthefoolish, notfrom 2.1
the astute. Whatever perils there are, all come from the foolish,
not from the astute. Whatever hazards there are, all come from
the foolish, not from the astute. It’s like a fire that spreads from a
hut made of reeds or grass, and burns down even a bungalow, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with doors fastened and windows
shuttered. In the same way, whatever dangers there are, all come
from the foolish, not from the astute. Whatever perils there are,
all come from the foolish, not from the astute. Whatever hazards
there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.
So, the fool is dangerous, but the astute person is safe. The fool 3.1
is perilous, but the astute person is not. The fool is hazardous, but
the astute person is not. There’s no danger, peril, or hazard that
comes from the astute.
So you should train like this: ‘We will reject the three things by 4.1
which a fool is known, and we will undertake and follow the three
things by which an astute person is known. Thats how you should
train.”

AN 3.2
##### Characteristics

_Lakkhaṇasutta_

1.1 “A fool is characterized by their deeds, and an astute person is characterized by their deeds, for wisdom is made beautiful when it is
evident. A fool is known by three things. What three? Bad conduct
by way of body, speech, and mind.
1.5 These are the three things by which a fool is known.
2.1 An astute person is known by three things. What three? Good
conduct by way of body, speech, and mind.
2.4 These are the three things by which an astute person is known.
3.1 So you should train like this: ‘We will reject the three things by
which a fool is known, and we will undertake and follow the three
things by which an astute person is known.’ That’s how you should
train.”

AN 3.3
##### Thinking

_Cintīsutta_

1.1 “There are these three characteristics, signs, and manifestations of
a fool. What three? A fool thinks poorly, speaks poorly, and acts
poorly. If a fool didn’t think poorly, speak poorly, and act poorly,
then how would the astute know of them: ‘This fellow is a fool, an
untrue person’? But since a fool does think poorly, speak poorly,
and act poorly, then the astute do know of them: ‘This fellow is a
fool, an untrue person’. These are the three characteristics, signs,
and manifestations of a fool.
2.1 There are these three characteristics, signs, and manifestations
of an astute person. What three? An astute person thinks well,
speaks well, and acts well. If an astute person didn t think well,
speak well, and act well, then how would the astute know of them:
‘This fellow is astute, a true person’? But since an astute person
does think well, speak well, and act well, then the astute do know
of them: ‘This fellow is astute, a true person’. These are the three
characteristics, signs, and manifestations of an astute person. So
you should train …”

AN 3.4
##### Mistakes

_Accayasutta_

“A fool is known by three things. What three? They don’t recognize 1.1
when they’ve made a mistake. When they do recognize it they
don’t deal with it properly. And when someone else confesses a
mistake to them, they don’t accept it properly.
These are the three things by which a fool is known. 1.4
An astute person is known by three things. What three? They 2.1
recognize when they’ve made a mistake. When they recognize it
they deal with it properly. And when someone else confesses a
mistake to them, they accept it properly.
These are the three things by which an astute person is known. 2.4
So you should train …”

AN 3.5
##### Irrational

_Ayonisosutta_

“A fool is known by three things. What three? They ask a question ir- 1.1
rationally. They answer a question irrationally. And when someone
else answers a question rationally—with well-rounded, coherent,
and relevant words and phrases—they disagree with it.
These are the three things by which a fool is known. 1.4
2.1 An astutepersonisknownbythreethings. Whatthree? Theyask
a question rationally. They answer a question rationally. And when
someone else answers a question rationally—with well-rounded,
coherent, and relevant words and phrases—they agree with it.
2.4 These are the three things by which an astute person is known.
So you should train …”

AN 3.6
##### Unskillful

_Akusalasutta_

1.1 “A fool is known by three things. What three? Unskillful deeds by
way of body, speech, and mind.
1.4 These are the three things by which a fool is known.
2.1 An astute person is known by three things. What three? Skillful
deeds by way of body, speech, and mind.
2.4 These are the three things by which an astute person is known.
So you should train …”

AN 3.7
##### Blameworthy

_Sāvajjasutta_

1.1 “A fool is known by three things. What three? Blameworthy deeds
by way of body, speech, and mind. … An astute person is known
by blameless deeds by way of body, speech, and mind. …”

AN 3.8
##### Hurtful

_Sabyābajjhasutta_

1.1 “A fool is known by three things. What three? Hurtful deeds by way
of body, speech, and mind. … An astute person is known by kind
deeds by way of body, speech, and mind. These are the three things
by which an astute person is known.
So you should train like this: ‘We will reject the three qualities 2.1
by which a fool is known, and we will undertake and follow the
three qualities by which an astute person is known.’ That’s how
you should train.”

AN 3.9
##### Broken

_Khatasutta_

“When a foolish, incompetent, untrue person has three qualities 1.1
they keep themselves broken and damaged. They deserve to be
blamed and criticized by sensible people, and they create much
wickedness. What three? Bad conduct by way of body, speech,
and mind.
When a foolish, incompetent untrue person has these three 1.4
qualities they keep themselves broken and damaged. They deserve
to be blamed and criticized by sensible people, and they create
much wickedness.
When an astute, competent true person has three qualities they 2.1
keep themselves intact and unscathed. They don’t deserve to be
blamed and criticized by sensible people, and they create much
merit. What three? Good conduct by way of body, speech, and
mind.
When an astute, competent true person has these three qualities 2.4
they keep themselves intact and unscathed. They don’t deserve to
be blamed and criticized by sensible people, and they create much
merit.”
AN 3.10
##### Stains

_Malasutta_

1.1 “Anyone who has three qualities, and has not given up three stains,
is cast down to hell. What three? They’re unethical, and haven’t
given up the stain of immorality. They’re jealous, and haven’t given
up the stain of jealousy. They’re stingy, and haven’t given up the
stain of stinginess.
1.6 Anyone whohasthesethreequalities, andhasnotgivenupthese
three stains, is cast down to hell.
2.1 Anyone who has three qualities, and has given up three stains,
is raised up to heaven. What three? They’re ethical, and have given
up the stain of immorality. They’re not jealous, and have given up
the stain of jealousy. They’re not stingy, and have given up the stain
of stinginess.
2.6 Anyone who has these three qualities, and has given up these
three stains, is raised up to heaven.”

AN 3.11
##### Well-known

_Ñātasutta_

“Mendicants, a well-known mendicant who has three qualities is 1.1
acting for the detriment and suffering of the people, against the
people, for the harm, detriment, and suffering of gods and humans.
What three? They encourage deeds of body and speech, as well as
principles, that don’t reinforce good qualities.
A well-known mendicant who has these three qualities is acting 1.4
for the detriment and suffering of the people, against the people,
for the harm, detriment, and suffering of gods and humans.

AN 3.12
##### Commemoration

_Sāraṇīyasutta_

1.1 “An anointed aristocratic king should commemorate three places
as long as he lives. What three? The place he was born. This is the
first place.
2.1 The place he was anointed as king. This is the second place.
3.1 The place where he won victory in battle, establishing himself
as foremost in battle. This is the third place. These are the three
places an anointed king should commemorate as long as he lives.
4.1 In the same way, a mendicant should commemorate three places
as long as they live. What three? The place where the mendicant
shaved off their hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went
forth from the lay life to homelessness. This is the first place.
5.1 The place where the mendicant truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation
of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of
suffering’. This is the second place.
6.1 The placewherethemendicantrealizestheundefiledfreedomof
heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having
realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
This is the third place. These are the three places a mendicant
should commemorate as long as they live.”

AN 3.13
##### Hopes

_Āsaṁsasutta_

1.1 “These three people are found in the world. What three? The hopeless, the hopeful, and the one who has done away with hope. And
what,mendicants,isahopelessperson? It’swhenapersonisreborn
in a low family—a family of corpse-workers, bamboo-workers,
hunters, chariot-makers, or scavengers—poor, with little to eat or
drink, where life is tough, and food and shelter are hard to find.
And they’re ugly, unsightly, deformed, sickly—one-eyed, crippled,
lame, or half-paralyzed. They don’t get to have food, drink, clothes,
and vehicles; garlands, fragrances, and makeup; or bed, house, and
lighting. They hear this: ‘They say the aristocrats have anointed
the aristocrat named so-and-so as king.’ It never occurs to them:
‘Oh, when will the aristocrats anoint me too as king?’ This is called
a hopeless person.
And what, mendicants, is a hopeful person? It’s when some 2.1
person is the eldest son of an anointed aristocratic king. He has
not yet been anointed, but is eligible, and has been confirmed in
the succession. He hears this: ‘They say that the aristocrats have
anointed the aristocrat named so-and-so as king.’ It occurs to him:
‘Oh, when will the aristocrats anoint me too as king?’ This is called
a hopeful person.
And what, mendicants, is a person who has done away with 3.1
hope? It’s when a king has been anointed. He hears this: ‘They say
thatthearistocratshaveanointedthearistocratnamedso-and-soas
king.’ It never occurs to him: ‘Oh, when will the aristocrats anoint
me too as king?’ Why is that? Because the former hope he had to
be anointed has now died down. This is called a person who has
done away with hope.
These are the three people found in the world. 3.10
In the same way, these three people are found among the men- 4.1
dicants. What three? The hopeless, the hopeful, and the one who
has done away with hope. And what, mendicants, is a hopeless
person? It’s when a person is unethical, of bad qualities, filthy,
with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true ascetic or spiritual
practitioner—though claiming to be one—rotten inside, festering,
and depraved. They hear this: ‘They say that the mendicant named
so-and-so has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom
by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with
their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’ It never occurs
to them: ‘Oh, when will I toorealize the undefiledfreedomof heart
and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized
it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements. This is
called a hopeless person.
5.1 And what, mendicants, is a hopeful person? It’s when a mendicant is ethical, of good character. They hear this: ‘They say that
the mendicant named so-and-so has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they
live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of
defilements.’ It occurs to them: ‘Oh, when will I too realize the
undefiledfreedomofheartandfreedombywisdominthisverylife,
and live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending
of defilements.’ This is called a hopeful person.
6.1 And what, mendicants, is a person who has done away with
hope? It’s when a mendicant is a perfected one, who has ended all
defilements. They hear this: ‘They say that the mendicant named
so-and-so has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom
by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with
their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’ It never occurs
to them: ‘Oh, when will I toorealize the undefiledfreedomof heart
and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized
it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements.’ Why is
that? Because the former hope they had to be freed has now died
down. This is called a person who has done away with hope.
6.10 These are the three people found among the mendicants.”

AN 3.14
##### The Wheel-Turning Monarch

_Cakkavattisutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, even a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled
king, does not wield power without having their own king.” When
he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha:
1.3 “But who is the king of the wheel-turning monarch, the just and
principled king?”
1.4 “It is principle, monk,” said the Buddha.
Monk, a wheel turning monarch provides just protection and 1.5
securityforhiscourt,relyingonlyonprinciple—honoring,respecting, and venerating principle, having principle as his flag, banner,
and authority.
He provides just protection and security for his aristocrats, vas- 2.1
sals, troops, brahmins and householders, people of town and country, ascetics and brahmins, beasts and birds. When he has done
this, he wields power only in a principled manner. And this power
cannot be undermined by any human enemy.
In the same way, monk, a Realized One, a perfected one, a fully 3.1
awakened Buddha, a just and principled king, provides just protection and security regarding bodily actions, relying only on principle—honoring, respecting, and venerating principle, having principle as his flag, banner, and authority. ‘This kind of bodily action
should be cultivated. This kind of bodily action should not be
cultivated.’
Furthermore, a Realized One … provides just protection and 4.1
securityregardingverbalactions, saying: ‘Thiskindofverbalaction
should be cultivated. This kind of verbal action should not be
cultivated.’ … And regarding mental actions: ‘This kind of mental
action should be cultivated. This kind of mental action should not
be cultivated.’
And when a Realized One, a perfected one, a fully awakened 5.1
Buddhahasprovidedjustprotectionandsecurityregardingactions
of body, speech, and mind, he rolls forth the supreme Wheel of
Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or
brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone in the world.”

##### About Pacetana

_Sacetanasutta_

1.1 At one time the Buddha was staying near Varanasi, in the deer
park at Isipatana. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
1.4 “Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:
2.1 “Once upon a time there was a king named Pacetana. Then King
Pacetana addressed his chariot-maker, ‘In six months’ time, my
good chariot-maker, there will be a battle. Are you able to make
me a new pair of wheels?’
2.5 ‘I can, Your Majesty,’ replied the chariot-maker. Then, when
it was six days less than six months later, the chariot-maker had
finished one wheel.
2.7 Then King Pacetana addressed his chariot-maker, ‘In six days’
time there will be a battle. Is my new pair of wheels finished?’
2.9 ‘Now that it is six days less than six months, Your Majesty, I have
finished one wheel.’
2.10 ‘Are you able to finish the second wheel in these six days?’
2.11 Saying, ‘I can, Your Majesty,’ the chariot-maker finished the
second wheel in six days. Taking the pair of wheels he went up to
King Pacetana, and said this to the king, ‘Your Majesty, these are
your two new wheels, finished.’
2.13 ‘But, my good chariot-maker, what is the difference between the
wheel that was finished in six days less than six months, and the
wheel finished in just six days? Because I can’t see any difference
between them.’
2.15 ‘But, Your Majesty, there is a difference. See now what it is.’
3.1 Then the chariot-maker rolled forth the wheel that had been
finished in six days. It rolled as far as the original impetus took it,
then wobbled and fell down. Then he rolled forth the wheel that
had been finished in six days less than six months. It rolled as far as
the original impetus took it, then stood still as if fixed to an axle.
But whatisthecause,mygoodchariot maker,whatisthereason 4.1
why the wheel that was finished in six days wobbled and fell, while
the one that was finished in six days less than six months stood still
as if fixed to an axle?’
‘The wheelthatwasfinishedinsixdays,YourMajesty,iscrooked, 4.3
flawed, and defective in rim, spoke, and hub. That’s why it wobbled
andfell. Thewheelthatwasfinishedinsixdayslessthansixmonths,
Your Majesty, is not crooked, flawed, and defective in rim, spoke,
and hub. That’s why it stood still as if fixed to an axle.’
Now, mendicants, you might think: ‘Surely that chariot-maker 5.1
must have been someone else at that time?’ But you should not
see it like that. I myself was the chariot-maker at that time. Then I
was skilled in the crooks, flaws, and defects of wood.
Now that I am a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, I am 5.6
skilled in the crooks, flaws, and defects of actions by body, speech,
and mind. Whatever monk or nun has not given up the crooks,
flaws, and defects of body, speech, and mind has fallen from the
teaching and training, just like the wheel that was finished in six
days.
Whatever monk or nun has given up the crooks, flaws, and de- 6.1
fects of body, speech, and mind is established in the teaching and
training, just like the wheel that was finished in six days less than
six months.
So you should train like this: ‘We will give up the crooks, flaws, 7.1
and defects of body, speech, and mind.’ That’s how you should
train.”

AN 3.16
##### Unfailing

_Apaṇṇakasutta_

“Mendicants, when a mendicant has three things their practice is 1.1
unfailing, and they have laid the groundwork for ending the defilements. What three? Its when a mendicant guards the sense doors,
eats in moderation, and is dedicated to wakefulness.
2.1 And how does a mendicant guard the sense doors? When a
mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up
in the features and details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure
would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint.
When they hear a sound with their ears … When they smell an
odor with their nose … When they taste a flavor with their tongue
… When they feel a touch with their body … When they know
an idea with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features
and details. If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become
overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint. That’s how a
mendicant guards the sense doors.
3.1 And how does a mendicant eat in moderation? It’s when a mendicant reflects rationally on the food that they eat: ‘Not for fun,
indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this
body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I
shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will have the means to keep going, blamelessness, and a
comfortable abiding.’ That’s how a mendicant eats in moderation.
4.1 And how is a mendicant dedicated to wakefulness? It’s when
a mendicant practices walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying their mind from obstacles. In the first watch of the night,
they continue to practice walking and sitting meditation. In the
middle watch, they lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right
side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and
focused on the time of getting up. In the last watch, they get up
and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying
their mind from obstacles. This is how a mendicant is dedicated to
wakefulness.
When a mendicant has these three things their practice is unfail 4.4
ing, and they have laid the groundwork for ending the defilements.”

AN 3.17
##### Hurting Yourself

_Attabyābādhasutta_

“These three things, mendicants, lead to hurting yourself, hurting 1.1
others, and hurting both. What three? Bad conduct by way of
body, speech, and mind.
These are three things that lead to hurting yourself, hurting 1.4
others, and hurting both.
These three things, mendicants, don’t lead to hurting yourself, 2.1
hurting others, or hurting both. What three? Good conduct by
way of body, speech, and mind.
These arethreethingsthatdon’tleadtohurtingyourself, hurting 2.4
others, or hurting both.”

AN 3.18
##### The Realm of the Gods

_Devalokasutta_

“Mendicants, if wanderers who follow another religion were to ask 1.1
you: ‘Reverend, do you lead the spiritual life with the ascetic Gotama so that you can be reborn in the realm of the gods?’ Being
questioned like this, wouldn’t you be horrified, repelled, and disgusted?”
“Yes, sir.” 1.4
“So it seems that you are horrified, repelled, and disgusted by 1.5
heavenly lifespan, beauty, happiness, glory, and sovereignty. How
much more then should you be horrified, embarrassed, and disgusted by bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind.”
AN 3.19
##### A Shopkeeper (1st)

_Paṭhamapāpaṇikasutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, a shopkeeper who has three factors is unable to acquire more wealth or to increase the wealth they’ve already acquired. What three? It’s when a shopkeeper doesn’t carefully focus
on their work in the morning, at midday, and in the afternoon. A
shopkeeper who has these three factors is unable to acquire more
wealth or to increase the wealth they’ve already acquired.
2.1 In the same way, a mendicant who has three qualities is unable
to acquire more skillful qualities or to increase the skillful qualities they’ve already acquired. What three? It’s when a mendicant
doesn’t carefully focus on a meditation subject as a basis of immersion in the morning, at midday, and in the afternoon.
2.4 A mendicant who has these three qualities is unable to acquire
more skillful qualities or to increase the skillful qualities they’ve
already acquired.
3.1 A shopkeeper who has three factors is able to acquire more
wealth or to increase the wealth they’ve already acquired. What
three? It’s when a shopkeeper carefully focuses on their work in
the morning, at midday, and in the afternoon. A shopkeeper who
has these three factors is able to acquire more wealth or to increase
the wealth they’ve already acquired.

morning, at midday, and in the afternoon.

AN 3.20
##### A Shopkeeper (2nd)

_Dutiyapāpaṇikasutta_

“Mendicants, a shopkeeper who has three factors soon acquires 1.1
great and abundant wealth. What three? It’s when a shopkeeper
sees clearly, is indefatigable, and has supporters.
And how does a shopkeeper see clearly? It’s when a shopkeeper 1.4
knows of a product: ‘This product is bought at this price and is
selling at this price. With this much investment, it’ll bring this
much profit.’ That’s how a shopkeeper sees clearly.
And how is a shopkeeper indefatigable? It’s when a shopkeeper 2.1
is skilled in buying and selling products. That’s how a shopkeeper
is indefatigable.
And how does a shopkeeper have supporters? It’s when rich, 3.1
affluent, andwealthyhouseholdersorhouseholders’childrenknow
of him: ‘This good shopkeeper sees clearly and is indefatigable.
They are capable of providing for their wives and children, and
paying us back from time to time.’ They deposit money with the
shopkeeper, saying: ‘With this, friend shopkeeper, earn money to
provide for your wives and children, and pay us back from time to
time.’ That’s how a shopkeeper has supporters.
A shopkeeper who has these three factors soon acquires great 3.7
and abundant wealth.
In the same way, a mendicant who has three qualities soon ac- 4.1
quires great and abundant skillful qualities. What three? It’s when
a mendicant sees clearly, is indefatigable, and has supporters.
And how does a mendicant see clearly? It’s when a mendicant 4.4
truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice
that leads to the cessation of suffering’. That’s how a mendicant
sees clearly.
And how is a mendicant indefatigable? It’s when a mendicant 5.1
liveswithenergyrousedupforgivingupunskillfulqualitiesandembracing skillful qualities. They are strong, staunchly vigorous, not
slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. That’s
how a mendicant is indefatigable.
6.1 And how does a mendicant have supporters? It’s when from
time to time a mendicant goes up to those mendicants who are
very learned—inheritors of the heritage, who have memorized
the teachings, the monastic law, and the outlines—and asks them
questions: ‘Why, sir, does it say this? What does that mean?’ Those
venerables clarify what is unclear, reveal what is obscure, and dispel
doubt regarding the many doubtful matters. That’s how a mendicant has supporters.
6.6 A mendicant who has these three qualities soon acquires great
and abundant skillful qualities.”
# The Chapter on Persons

AN 3.21
##### With Saviṭṭha

_Samiddhasutta_

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near 1.1
Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Then Venerable Saviṭṭha and Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita went up 1.3
to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they 1.4
sat down to one side and Venerable Sāriputta said to Venerable
Saviṭṭha, “Reverend Saviṭṭha, these three people are found in the
world. What three? The direct witness, the one attained to view,
and the one freed by faith. These are the three people found in the
world. Of these three people, who do you believe to be the finest?”
“Reverend Sāriputta, these three people are found in the world. 3.1
What three? The direct witness, the one attained to view, and the
one freed by faith. These are the three people found in the world.
Ofthesethreepeople,Ibelievethepersonfreedbyfaithtobefinest.
Why is that? Because this person’s faculty of faith is outstanding.”
Then Sāriputta said to Mahākoṭṭhita, “Reverend Koṭṭhika, these 4.1
three people are found in the world. What three? The direct witness, the one attained to view, and the one freed by faith. These are
the three people found in the world. Of these three people, who
do you believe to be the finest?”
5.1 Reverend Sāriputta, these three people are found in the world.
What three? The direct witness, the one attained to view, and the
one freed by faith. These are the three people found in the world.
Of these three people, I believe the direct witness to be finest. Why
is that? Because this person’s faculty of immersion is outstanding.”
6.1 Then Mahākoṭṭhita said to Sāriputta, “Reverend Sāriputta, these
three people are found in the world. What three? The direct witness, the one attained to view, and the one freed by faith. These are
the three people found in the world. Of these three people, who
do you believe to be the finest?”
7.1 “Reverend Koṭṭhika, these three people are found in the world.
What three? The direct witness, the one attained to view, and the
one freed by faith. These are the three people found in the world.
Of these three people, I believe the person attained to view to be
finest. Why is that? Because this person’s faculty of wisdom is
outstanding.”
8.1 Then Sāriputta said to Saviṭṭha and Mahākoṭṭhita, “Each of us
hasspokenfromtheheart. Come,reverends,let’sgototheBuddha,
and tell him about this. As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”
8.5 “Yes, reverend,” they replied. Then Sāriputta, Saviṭṭha, and Mahākoṭṭhita went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one
side. Then Sāriputta told the Buddha of all they had discussed.
9.1 “In this matter, Sāriputta, it’s not easy to categorically declare
that one of these three people is finest. In some cases, a person who
is freed by faith is practicing for perfection, while the direct witness
and the one attained to view are once-returners or non-returners.
10.1 In this matter, it’s not easy to categorically declare that one of
thesethreepeopleisfinest. Insomecases,adirectwitnessispracticing for perfection, while the one freed by faith and the one attained
to view are once-returners or non-returners.
11.1 In this matter, it’s not easy to categorically declare that one of
these three people is finest. In some cases, one attained to view
is practicing for perfection, while the one freed by faith and the
direct witness are once-returners or non-returners.
In this matter, its not easy to categorically declare that one of 12.1
these three people is finest.”

AN 3.22
##### Patients

_Gilānasutta_

“These three patients are found in the world. What three? 1.1
In some cases a patient won’t recover from an illness, regardless 1.3
of whether or not they get suitable food and medicines, and a
capable carer.
In some cases a patient will recover from an illness, regardless of 2.1
whether or not they get suitable food and medicines, and a capable
carer.
In some cases a patient can recover from an illness, but only if 3.1
they get suitable food and medicines, and a capable carer, and not
if they don’t get these things.
Now, it’s for the sake of the last patient—who will recover only 4.1
if they get suitable food and medicines, and a capable carer—that
food, medicines, and a carer are prescribed. But also, for the sake
of this patient, the other patients should be looked after.
These are the three kinds of patients found in the world. 4.3
In the same way, these three people similar to patients are found 5.1
in the world. What three? Some people don’t enter the sure path
with regards to skillful qualities, regardless of whether or not they
get to see a Realized One, and to hear the teaching and training
that he proclaims.
Some people do enter the sure path with regards to skillful qual- 6.1
ities, regardless of whether or not they get to see a Realized One,
and to hear the teaching and training that he proclaims.
Some people can enter the sure path with regards to skillful 7.1
qualities, but only if they get to see a Realized One, and to hear the
teaching and training that he proclaims, and not when they don’t
get those things.
8.1 Now, its for the sake of this last person that teaching the
Dhamma is prescribed, that is, the one who can enter the sure
path with regards to skillful qualities, but only if they get to see a
Realized One, and to hear the teaching and training that he proclaims. Butalso, forthesakeofthisperson, theotherpeopleshould
be taught Dhamma.
8.3 These are the three people similar to patients found in the world.”

AN 3.23
##### Choices

_Saṅkhārasutta_

1.1 “These three people are found in the world. What three?
1.3 Firstly, a certain person makes hurtful choices by way of body,
speech, and mind. Having made these choices, they’re reborn in
a hurtful world, where hurtful contacts strike them. Touched by
hurtful contacts, they experience hurtful feelings that are exclusively painful—like the beings in hell.
2.1 Furthermore, another person makes pleasing choices by way
of body, speech, and mind. Having made these choices, they are
reborn in a pleasing world, where pleasing contacts strike them.
Touched by pleasing contacts, they experience pleasing feelings of
perfect happiness—like the gods of universal beauty.
3.1 Furthermore, another person makes both hurtful and pleasing
choices by way of body, speech, and mind. Having made these
choices, they are reborn in a world that is both hurtful and pleasing, where hurtful and pleasing contacts strike them. Touched by
both hurtful and pleasing contacts, they experience both hurtful
and pleasing feelings that are a mixture of pleasure and pain—like
humans, some gods, and some beings in the underworld.
3.5 These are the three people found in the world.”
AN 3.24
##### Very Helpful

_Bahukārasutta_

“Mendicants, these three people are very helpful to another. What 1.1
three?
The person who has enabled you to go for refuge to the Buddha, 1.3
theteaching,andtheSaṅgha. Thispersonisveryhelpfultoanother.
Furthermore, the person who has enabled you to truly under- 2.1
stand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This
is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to
the cessation of suffering’. This person is very helpful to another.
Furthermore, the person who has enabled you to realize the 3.1
undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very
life, and live having realized it with your own insight due to the
ending of defilements. This person is very helpful to another.
These are the three people who are very helpful to another per- 3.3
son.
And Isaythatthereis no-onemorehelpfultoanotherthanthese 4.1
three people. And I also say that it’s not easy to repay these three
people by bowing down to them, rising up for them, greeting them
with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette for them; or by
providing them with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and
supplies for the sick.”

AN 3.25
##### Like Diamond

_Vajirūpamasutta_

“These three people are found in the world. What three? A person 1.1
with a mind like an open sore, a person with a mind like lightning,
and a person with a mind like diamond.
And who has a mind like an open sore? It’s a person who is 1.4
irritable and bad-tempered. Even when lightly criticized they lose
their temper, becoming annoyed, hostile, and hard hearted, and
theydisplayannoyance,hate,andbitterness. They’relikeafestering
sore, which, when you hit it with a stick or a stone, discharges even
more. Inthesameway,apersonisirritableandbad-tempered. Even
when lightly criticized they lose their temper, becoming annoyed,
hostile, and hard-hearted, and they display annoyance, hate, and
bitterness. This is called a person with a mind like an open sore.
2.1 And who has a mind like lightning? It’s a person who truly
understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’
… ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that
leads to the cessation of suffering’. They’re like a person with keen
eyes in the dark of the night, who sees by a flash of lightning. In the
same way, a person truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This
is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ …
‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. This is
called a person with a mind like lightning.
3.1 And who has a mind like diamond? It’s a person who realizes
the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very
life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due
to the ending of defilements. It’s like a diamond, which can’t be
cut by anything at all, not even a gem or a stone. In the same way,
a person realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by
wisdom in this very life. … This is called a person with a mind like
diamond.
3.6 These are the three people found in the world.”

AN 3.26
##### Associates

_Sevitabbasutta_

1.1 “These three people are found in the world. What three? There is a
personyoushouldn’tassociatewith, accompany, orattend. Thereis
a person you should associate with, accompany, and attend. There
is a person you should associate with, accompany, and attend with
honor and respect.
Who is the person you shouldn’t associate with, accompany, or 1.6
attend? It’s a person who is inferior in terms of ethics, immersion,
and wisdom. You shouldn’t associate with, accompany, or attend
such a person, except out of kindness and sympathy.
Who is the person you should associate with, accompany, and 2.1
attend? It’s a person who is similar in terms of ethics, immersion,
and wisdom. You should associate with, accompany, and attend
such a person. Why is that? Thinking, ‘Since our ethical conduct is
similar, we can discuss ethics, the conversation will flow, and we’ll
both be at ease. Since our immersion is similar, we can discuss immersion, the conversation will flow, and we’ll both be at ease. Since
our wisdom is similar, we can discuss wisdom, the conversation
will flow, and we’ll both be at ease.’ That’s why you should associate
with, accompany, and attend such a person.
Who is the person you should associate with, accompany, and 3.1
attend with honor and respect? It’s a person who is superior in
terms of ethics, immersion, and wisdom. You should associate
with, accompany, and attend such a person with honor and respect.
Why is that? Thinking, ‘I’ll fulfill the entire spectrum of ethical
conduct I haven’t yet fulfilled, or support with wisdom in every
situation the ethical conduct I’ve already fulfilled. I’ll fulfill the
entire spectrum of immersion I haven’t yet fulfilled, or support
with wisdom in every situation the immersion I’ve already fulfilled.
I’ll fulfill the entire spectrum of wisdom I haven’t yet fulfilled, or
support with wisdom in every situation the wisdom I’ve already
fulfilled.’ That’s why you should associate with, accompany, and
attend this person with honor and respect.
These are the three people found in the world. 3.9

A man who associates with an inferior goes downhill, 4.1
but associating with an equal, you’ll never decline;
following the best, you’ll quickly rise up,
so you should keep company
with people better than you.”
AN 3.27
##### You Should be Disgusted

_Jigucchitabbasutta_

1.1 “These three people are found in the world. What three? There
is a person who you should be disgusted by, and you shouldn’t
associate with, accompany, or attend them. There is a person you
should regard with equanimity, and you shouldn’t associate with,
accompany, or attend them. There is a person you should associate
with, accompany, and attend.
1.6 Who is the person you should be disgusted by, and not associate
with, accompany, or attend? It’s a person who is unethical, of
bad qualities, filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true
ascetic or spiritual practitioner—though claiming to be one—
rotten inside, festering, and depraved. You should be disgusted by
such a person, and you shouldn’t associate with, accompany, or
attend them. Why is that? Even if you don’t follow the example of
such a person, you still get a bad reputation: ‘That individual has
bad friends, companions, and associates.’ They’re like a snake that’s
been living in a pile of dung. Even if it doesn’t bite, it’ll still rub off
on you. In the same way, even if you don’t follow the example of
such a person, you still get a bad reputation: ‘That individual has
bad friends, companions, and associates.’ That’s why you should
be disgusted by such a person, and you shouldn’t associate with,
accompany, or attend them.
2.1 Who is the person you should regard with equanimity, and not
associate with, accompany, or attend? It’s a person who is irritable
and bad-tempered. Even when lightly criticized they lose their
temper, becoming annoyed, hostile, and hard-hearted, and they
display annoyance, hate, and bitterness. They’re like a festering
sore, which, when you hit it with a stick or a stone, discharges even
more. In the same way, someone is irritable and bad-tempered.
They’re like a firebrand of pale-moon ebony, which, when you hit it
with a stick or a stone, sizzles and crackles even more. In the same
way, someone is irritable and bad tempered. They re like a sewer,
which, when you stir it with a stick or a stone, stinks even more.
In the same way, a person is irritable and bad-tempered. Even
when lightly criticized they lose their temper, becoming annoyed,
hostile, and hard-hearted, and they display annoyance, hate, and
bitterness. You should regard such a person with equanimity, and
you shouldn’t associate with, accompany, or attend them. Why is
that? Thinking, ‘They might abuse or insult me, or do me harm.’
That’s why you should regard such a person with equanimity, and
you shouldn’t associate with, accompany, or attend them.
Who is the person you should associate with, accompany, and 3.1
attend? It’s a person who is ethical, of good character. You should
associate with, accompany, and attend such a person. Why is that?
Even if you don’t follow the example of such a person, you still get
a good reputation: ‘That individual has good friends, companions,
and associates.’ That’s why you should associate with, accompany,
and attend such a person.
These are the three people found in the world. 3.8

A man who associates with an inferior goes downhill, 4.1
but associating with an equal, you’ll never decline;
following the best, you’ll quickly rise up,
so you should keep company
with people better than you.”

##### Speech like Dung

_Gūthabhāṇīsutta_

“These three people are found in the world. What three? One with 1.1
speechlikedung,onewithspeechlikeflowers,andonewithspeech
like honey.
And who has speech like dung? It’s a person who is summoned 1.4
to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal
court, and asked to bear witness: ‘Please, mister, say what you
know. Not knowing, they say I know. Knowing, they say I don t
know.’ Not seeing, they say ‘I see.’ And seeing, they say ‘I don’t see.’
So they deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another, or
for some trivial worldly reason. This is called a person with speech
like dung.
2.1 And whohasspeechlikeflowers? It’sapersonwhoissummoned
to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal
court, and asked to bear witness: ‘Please, mister, say what you
know.’ Not knowing, they say ‘I don’t know.’ Knowing, they say
‘I know.’ Not seeing, they say ‘I don’t see.’ And seeing, they say
‘I see.’ So they don’t deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or
another, or for some trivial worldly reason. This is called a person
with speech like flowers.
3.1 And who has speech like honey? It’s a person who gives up
harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the
ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the
people. This is called a person with speech like honey.
3.5 These are the three people found in the world.”

AN 3.29
##### Blind

_Andhasutta_

1.1 “These three people are found in the world. What three? The blind,
the one-eyed, and the two-eyed.
1.4 Who is the blind person? It’s someone who doesn’t have the
kind of vision that’s needed to acquire more wealth or to increase
the wealth they’ve already acquired. Nor do they have the kind of
vision that’s needed to know the difference between qualities that
are skillful and unskillful, blameworthy and blameless, inferior and
superior, and those on the side of dark and bright. This is called a
blind person.
2.1 Who is the person with one eye? It’s someone who has the kind
of vision that’s needed to acquire more wealth and to increase the
wealth they ve already acquired. But they don t have the kind of
vision that’s needed to know the difference between qualities that
are skillful and unskillful, blameworthy and blameless, inferior and
superior, and those on the side of dark and bright. This is called a
one-eyed person.
Who is the person with two eyes? It’s someone who has the 3.1
kind of vision that’s needed to acquire more wealth and to increase
the wealth they’ve already acquired. And they have the kind of
vision that’s needed to know the difference between skillful and
unskillful, blameworthy and blameless, inferior and superior, or
qualities on the side of dark and bright. This is called a two-eyed
person.
These are the three people found in the world. 3.6

Neither suitable wealth, 4.1
nor merit do they make.
They hold a losing hand on both counts,
those who are blind, with ruined eyes.

And now the one-eyed 5.1
person is explained.
By methods good and bad,
that devious person seeks wealth.

Both by fraudulent, thieving deeds, 6.1
and also by lies,
the young man’s skilled at piling up money,
and enjoying sensual pleasures.
From here they go to hell—
the one-eyed person is ruined.

And now the two-eyed is explained, 7.1
the best individual.
Their wealth is earned legitimately,
money acquired by their own hard work.

They give with best of intentions, 8.1
that peaceful hearted person.
They go to a good place,
where there is no sorrow.

9.1 The blind and the one-eyed,
you should avoid from afar.
But you should keep the two-eyed close,
the best individual.”

AN 3.30
##### Upside-down

_Avakujjasutta_

1.1 “These three people are found in the world. What three? One with
upside-down wisdom, one with wisdom on their lap, and one with
widespread wisdom.
1.4 And who is the person with upside-down wisdom? It’s a person who often goes to the monastery to hear the teaching in the
presence of the mendicants. The mendicants teach them Dhamma
that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the
end, meaningful and well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. But even while sitting there, that
person doesn’t apply the mind to the beginning, middle, or end of
the discussion. And when they get up from their seat, they don’t
apply the mind to the beginning, middle, or end of the discussion.
It’s like when a pot full of water is tipped over, so the water drains
out and doesn’t stay. In the same way, a person often goes to the
monastery to hear the teaching in the presence of the mendicants.
The mendicants teach them Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and
well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full
and pure. But even while sitting there, that person doesn’t apply
the mind to the discussion in the beginning, middle, or end. And
when they get up from their seat, they don’t apply the mind to the
beginning, middle, or end of the discussion. This is called a person
with upside-down wisdom.
And who is the person with wisdom on their lap? It’s a person 2.1
who often goes to the monastery to hear the teaching in the presence of the mendicants. The mendicants teach them Dhamma
that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the
end, meaningful and well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. While sitting there, that person
applies the mind to the discussion in the beginning, middle, and
end. But when they get up from their seat, they don’t apply the
mind to the beginning, middle, or end of the discussion. It’s like a
person who has different kinds of food crammed on their lap—
such as sesame, rice, sweets, or jujube—so that if they get up from
the seat without mindfulness, everything gets scattered. In the
same way, a person often goes to the monastery to hear the teaching in the presence of the mendicants. The mendicants teach them
Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and
good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And they reveal a
spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. While sitting there,
that person applies the mind to the discussion in the beginning,
middle, and end. But when they get up from their seat, they don’t
apply the mind to the beginning, middle, or end of the discussion.
This is called a person with wisdom on their lap.
And who is the person with widespread wisdom? It’s a person 3.1
who often goes to the monastery to hear the teaching in the presence of the mendicants. The mendicants teach them Dhamma
that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the
end, meaningful and well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. While sitting there, that person
applies the mind to the discussion in the beginning, middle, and
end. And when they get up from their seat, they continue to apply the mind to the beginning, middle, or end of the discussion.
It’s like when a pot full of water is set straight, so the water stays
and doesn’t drain out. In the same way, a person often goes to
the monastery to hear the teaching in the presence of the mendicants. The mendicants teach them Dhamma thats good in the
beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful
and well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely
full and pure. While sitting there, that person applies the mind
to the discussion in the beginning, middle, and end. And when
they get up from their seat, they continue to apply the mind to the
beginning, middle, or end of the discussion. This is called a person
with widespread wisdom.
3.12 These are the three people found in the world.

4.1 A person with upside-down wisdom,
is a simpleton and cannot see,
and even if they frequently
go into the mendicants’ presence,

5.1 such a person can’t learn
the beginning, middle, or end
of the discussion,
for their wisdom is lacking.

6.1 The person with wisdom on their lap
is better than that, it’s said;
but even if they frequently
go into the mendicants’ presence,

7.1 such a person can only learn
the beginning, middle, and end
while sitting in that seat;
but they’ve only grasped the phrasing,
for when they get up their understanding fails,
and what they’ve learned is lost.

8.1 The person with widespread wisdom
is better than that, it’s said;
and if they, too, frequently
go into the mendicants’ presence,
such a person can learn 9.1
the beginning, middle, and end
while sitting in that seat;
and when they’ve grasped the phrasing,

they remember it with the best of intentions. 10.1
That peaceful-hearted person,
practicing in line with the teaching,
would make an end of suffering.”
# The Chapter on Messengers of the Gods

AN 3.31
##### With Divinity

_Sabrahmakasutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, a family where the children honor their parents in
their home is said to live with divinity. A family where the children
honor their parents in their home is said to live with the first tutors.
A family where the children honor their parents in their home is
said to live with those worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods.
1.4 ‘Divinity’ is a term for your parents.
1.5 ‘First tutors’ is a term for your parents.
1.6 ‘Worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods’ is a term for your
parents.
1.7 Why is that? Parents are very helpful to their children, they raise
them, nurture them, and show them the world.

2.1 Parents are said to be ‘divinity’
and ‘first tutors’, it’s said.
They’re worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods
from their children,
for they love their offspring.

3.1 Therefore an astute person
would revere them and honor them
with food and drink,
clothes and bedding,
anointing and bathing,
and by washing their feet.

Because they look after 4.1
their parents like this,
in this life they’re praised by the astute,
and they depart to rejoice in heaven.”

AN 3.32
##### With Ānanda

_Ānandasutta_

Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down 1.1
to one side, and said to the Buddha:
“Could it be, sir, that a mendicant might gain a state of immer- 2.1
sion such that there’s no I-making, mine-making, or underlying
tendency to conceit for this conscious body; and no I-making,
mine-making, or underlying tendency to conceit for all external
stimuli; and that they’d live having attained the freedom of heart
and freedom by wisdom where I-making, mine-making, and the
underlying tendency to conceit are no more?”
“It could be, Ānanda, that a mendicant gains a state of immer- 2.3
sion such that they have no I-making, mine-making, or underlying
tendency to conceit for this conscious body; and no I-making,
mine-making, or underlying tendency to conceit for all external
stimuli; and that they’d live having attained the freedom of heart
and freedom by wisdom where I-making, mine-making, and the
underlying tendency to conceit are no more.”
“But how could this be, sir?” 3.1
“Ānanda, it’s when a mendicant thinks: ‘This is peaceful; this 4.1
is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all
attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extin
guishment.’
4.3 That’s how, Ānanda, a mendicant might gain a state of immersion such that there’s no I-making, mine-making, or underlying
tendency to conceit for this conscious body; and no I-making,
mine-making, or underlying tendency to conceit for all external
stimuli; and that they’d live having achieved the freedom of heart
and freedom by wisdom where I-making, mine-making, and the
underlying tendency to conceit are no more.
5.1 And Ānanda, this is what I was referring to in ‘The Way to the
Far Shore’, in ‘The Questions of Puṇṇaka’ when I said:

6.1 ‘Having appraised the world high and low,
there is nothing in the world that disturbs them.
Peaceful, unclouded, untroubled,
with no need for hope—
they’ve crossed over rebirth and old age, I declare.’”

AN 3.33
##### With Sāriputta

_Sāriputtasutta_

1.1 Then Venerable Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, and
sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, “Maybe I’ll teach
Dhammainbrief,maybeindetail,maybebothinbriefandindetail.
But it’s hard to find anyone who understands.”
1.6 “Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! Let
the Buddha teach Dhamma in brief, in detail, and both in brief and
in detail. There will be those who understand the teaching!”
2.1 “So, Sāriputta, you should train like this: ‘There’ll be no Imaking, mine-making, or underlying tendency to conceit for this
conscious body; and no I-making, mine-making, or underlying
tendency to conceit for all external stimuli; and we’ll live having
achieved the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where Imaking, mine making, and the underlying tendency to conceit are
no more.’ That’s how you should train.
When a mendicant has no I-making, mine-making, or underly- 3.1
ing tendency to conceit for this conscious body; and no I-making,
mine-making, or underlying tendency to conceit for all external
stimuli; and they live having attained the freedom of heart and
freedom by wisdom where I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendency to conceit are no more—they’re called a mendicant
who has cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit has made an end of suffering.
And Sāriputta, this is what I was referring to in ‘The Way to the 3.4
Far Shore’, in ‘The Questions of Udaya’ when I said:

‘The giving up of both 4.1
sensual desires and displeasures,
the dispelling of dullness,
and the prevention of remorse;

pure equanimity and mindfulness, 5.1
preceded by investigation of principles—
this, I declare, is liberation by enlightenment,
the smashing of ignorance.’”

AN 3.34
##### Sources

_Nidānasutta_

“Mendicants, there are these three sources that give rise to deeds. 1.1
What three? Greed, hate, and delusion are sources that give rise to
deeds.
Any deed that emerges from greed—born, sourced, and orig- 2.1
inated from greed—ripens where that new incarnation is born.
And wherever that deed ripens, its result is experienced—either in
the present life, or in the next life, or in some subsequent period.
3.1 Any deed that emerges from hate born, sourced, and origi
nated from hate—ripens where that new incarnation is born. And
wherever that deed ripens, its result is experienced—either in the
present life, or in the next life, or in some subsequent period.
4.1 Any deed that emerges from delusion—born, sourced, and originated from delusion—ripens where that new incarnation is born.
And wherever that deed ripens, its result is experienced—either in
the present life, or in the next life, or in some subsequent period.
5.1 Suppose some seeds were intact, unspoiled, not weatherdamaged, fertile, and well-kept. They’re sown in a well-prepared,
productive field, and the heavens provide plenty of rain. Then
those seeds would grow, increase, and mature.
5.4 In the same way, any deed that emerges from greed—born,
sourced, and originated from greed—ripens where that new incarnation is born. And wherever that deed ripens, its result is
experienced—either in the present life, or in the next life, or in
some subsequent period.
6.1 Any deed that emerges from hate …
6.2 Any deed that emerges from delusion—born, sourced, and originated from delusion—ripens where that new incarnation is born.
And wherever that deed ripens, its result is experienced—either in
the present life, or in the next life, or in some subsequent period.
These are three sources that give rise to deeds.
7.1 Mendicants, there are these three sources that give rise to deeds.
What three? Contentment, love, and understanding are sources
that give rise to deeds.
8.1 Any deed that emerges from contentment—born, sourced, and
originated from contentment—is given up when greed is done
away with. It’s cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.
9.1 Any deed that emerges from love—born, sourced, and originated from love—is abandoned when hate is done away with. It’s
cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable
to arise in the future.
Any deed that emerges from understanding born, sourced, 10.1
and originated from understanding—is abandoned when delusion
is done away with. It’s cut off at the root, made like a palm stump,
obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.
Suppose some seeds were intact, unspoiled, not damaged by 11.1
wind and sun, fertile, and well-kept. But someone would burn
them with fire, reduce them to ashes, and sweep away the ashes
in a strong wind, or float them away down a swift stream. Then
those seeds would be cut off at the root, made like a palm stump,
obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.
In the same way, any deed that emerges from contentment— 11.6
born, sourced, and originated from contentment—is abandoned
when greed is done away with. It’s cut off at the root, made like a
palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.
Any deed that emerges from love … Any deed that emerges 12.1
from understanding—born, sourced, and originated from understanding—is abandoned when delusion is done away with. It’s cut
off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to
arise in the future.
These are three sources that give rise to deeds. 12.4

When an ignorant person acts 13.1
out of greed, hate, or delusion,
any deeds they have done,
a little or a lot,
are to be experienced right here,
not in any other place.

So a wise person, 14.1
a mendicant arousing knowledge
of the outcome of greed, hate, and delusion,
would cast off all bad destinies.”
AN 3.35
##### With Hatthaka

_Hatthakasutta_

1.1 So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Āḷavī,
on a mat of leaves by a cow-path in a grove of Indian Rosewood.
1.3 Then as Hatthaka of Āḷavī was going for a walk he saw the Buddhasittingonthatmatofleaves. HewentuptotheBuddha, bowed,
sat down to one side, and said, “Sir, I trust the Buddha slept well?”
1.6 “Yes, prince, I slept well. I am one of those who sleep at ease in
the world.”
2.1 “The winter nights are cold, sir, and it’s the week of mid-winter,
when the snow falls. Rough is the ground trampled under the cows’
hooves, and thin is the mat of leaves. The leaves are sparse on the
trees, the ocher robes are cold, and cold blows the north wind. And
yet the Buddha says, ‘Yes, prince, I slept well. I am one of those
who sleep at ease in the world.’”
3.1 “Well then, prince, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you
can answer as you like. What do you think? Take the case of a
householder or his son, who lives in a bungalow, plastered inside
and out, draft-free, with door fastened and window shuttered. His
couch is spread with woolen covers—shag-piled, pure white, or
embroidered with flowers—and spread with a fine deer hide. It
has a canopy above and red pillows at both ends. An oil lamp is
burning there, while his four wives attend to him in all manner of
agreeable ways. What do you think, prince, would he sleep at ease,
or not? Or how do you see this?”
3.8 “He would sleep at ease, sir. Of those who sleep at ease in the
world, he would be one.”
4.1 “What do you think, prince? Is it not possible that a fever born
of greed—physical or mental—might arise in that householder or
householder’s son, burning him so he sleeps badly?”
4.3 “Yes, sir.”
The greed that burns that householder or householder s son, 5.1
makingthemsleepbadly,hasbeencutoffattherootbytheRealized
One, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in
the future. That’s why I sleep at ease.
What do you think, prince? Is it not possible that a fever born 6.1
of hate … or a fever born of delusion—physical or mental—might
arise in that householder or householder’s son, burning him so he
sleeps badly?”
“Yes, sir.” 6.4
“The delusion that burns that householder or householder’s 7.1
son, making them sleep badly, has been cut off at the root by the
Realized One, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to
arise in the future. That’s why I sleep at ease.

A brahmin who is fully quenched 8.1
always sleeps at ease.
Sensual pleasures slip off them,
they’re cooled, free of attachments.

Since they’ve cut off all clinging, 9.1
and removed the stress from the heart,
the peaceful sleep at ease,
having found peace of mind.”

AN 3.36
##### Messengers of the Gods

_Devadūtasutta_

“There are, mendicants, these three messengers of the gods. What 1.1
three?
Firstly, someone does bad things by way of body, speech, and 1.3
mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in
a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. The wardens of
hell take them by the arms and present them to King Yama, saying:
‘Your Majesty, this person did not pay due respect to their mother
and father, ascetics and brahmins, or honor the elders in the family.
May Your Majesty punish them!’
2.1 Then King Yama pursues, presses, and grills them about the first
messenger of the gods: ‘Mister, did you not see the first messenger
of the gods that appeared among human beings?’
2.3 They say, ‘I saw nothing, sir.’
3.1 King Yama says to them, ‘Mister, did you not see among human
beings an elderly woman or a man—eighty, ninety, or a hundred
years old—bent double, crooked, leaning on a staff, trembling as
they walk, ailing, past their prime, with teeth broken, hair grey and
scanty or bald, skin wrinkled, and limbs blotchy?’
3.3 They say, ‘I saw that, sir.’
4.1 King Yama says to them, ‘Mister, did it not occur to you—being
sensibleandmature—“I,too, amliabletogrowold. I’mnotexempt
fromoldage. I’dbetterdogoodbywayofbody, speech, andmind”?’
4.4 They say, ‘I couldn’t, sir. I was negligent.’
5.1 King Yama says to them, ‘Mister, because you were negligent,
you didn’t do good by way of body, speech, and mind. Indeed,
they’ll definitely punish you to fit your negligence. That bad deed
wasn’t done by your mother, father, brother, or sister. It wasn’t
done by friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by the deities,
or by ascetics and brahmins. That bad deed was done by you alone,
and you alone will experience the result.’
6.1 Then King Yama grills them about the second messenger of the
gods: ‘Mister, did you not see the second messenger of the gods
that appeared among human beings?’
6.3 They say, ‘I saw nothing, sir.’ King Yama says to them, ‘Mister,
did you not see among human beings a woman or a man, sick,
suffering, gravely ill, collapsed in their own urine and feces, being
picked up by some and put down by others?’
6.7 They say, ‘I saw that, sir.’
7.1 King Yama says to them, ‘Mister, did it not occur to you—being
sensible and mature—“I, too, am liable to become sick. I’m not
exempt from sickness. I’d better do good by way of body, speech,
and mind”?’
They say, I couldn t, sir. I was negligent. 7.4
King Yama says to them, ‘Mister, because you were negligent, 8.1
you didn’t do good by way of body, speech, and mind. Well, they’ll
definitely punish you to fit your negligence. That bad deed wasn’t
done by your mother, father, brother, or sister. It wasn’t done by
friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by the deities, or by
ascetics and brahmins. That bad deed was done by you alone, and
you alone will experience the result.’
Then King Yama grills them about the third messenger of the 9.1
gods: ‘Mister, did you not see the third messenger of the gods that
appeared among human beings?’
They say, ‘I saw nothing, sir.’ 9.3
King Yama says to them, ‘Mister, did you not see among human 10.1
beings a woman or a man, dead for one, two, or three days, bloated,
livid, and festering?’
They say, ‘I saw that, sir.’ 10.3
King Yama says to them, ‘Mister, did it not occur to you—being 11.1
sensible and mature—“I, too, am liable to die. I’m not exempt from
death. I’d better do good by way of body, speech, and mind”?’
They say, ‘I couldn’t, sir. I was negligent.’ 11.4
King Yama says to them, ‘Mister, because you were negligent, 12.1
you didn’t do good by way of body, speech, and mind. Well, they’ll
definitely punish you to fit your negligence. That bad deed wasn’t
done by your mother, father, brother, or sister. It wasn’t done by
friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by the deities, or by
ascetics and brahmins. That bad deed was done by you alone, and
you alone will experience the result.’
After grilling them about the third messenger of the gods, King 13.1
Yama falls silent. The wardens of hell punish them with the fivefold crucifixion. They drive red-hot stakes through the hands and
feet, and another in the middle of the chest. And there they suffer
painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that
bad deed is eliminated.
The wardens of hell throw them down and hack them with axes. 14.1
…
15.1 They hang them upside down and hack them with hatchets. …
15.2 They harness them to a chariot, and drive them back and forth
across burning ground, blazing and glowing. …
15.3 They makethemclimbupanddownahugemountainofburning
coals, blazing and glowing. …
15.4 The wardens of hell turn them upside down and throw them
in a red-hot copper pot, burning, blazing, and glowing. There
they’re seared in boiling scum, and they’re swept up and down
and round and round. And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe,
acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.
The wardens of hell toss them into the Great Hell.
15.8 Now, about that Great Hell:

16.1 ‘Four are its corners, four its doors,
neatly divided in equal parts.
Surrounded by an iron wall,
of iron is its roof.

17.1 The ground is even made of iron,
it burns with fierce fire.
The heat forever radiates
a hundred leagues around.’

18.1 Once upon a time, King Yama thought, ‘Those who do such bad
deeds in the world receive these many different punishments. Oh, I
hopeImayberebornasahumanbeing! AndthataRealizedOne—
a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha—arises in the world!
And that I may pay homage to the Buddha! Then the Buddha can
teach me Dhamma, so that I may understand his teaching.’
18.5 Now, I don’t say this because I’ve heard it from some other
ascetic or brahmin. I only say it because I’ve known, seen, and
realized it for myself.

19.1 When warned by the gods’ messengers,
those people who are negligent
sorrow for a long time
when they go to that wretched place.

When warned by the gods’ messengers, 20.1
the good and true persons here,
never neglect
the teaching of the Noble One.

Seeing the peril in grasping, 21.1
the origin of birth and death,
the unattached are freed
with the ending of birth and death.

Happy, they’ve come to a safe place, 22.1
quenched in this very life.
They’ve gone beyond all threats and perils,
and risen above all suffering.”

AN 3.37
##### The Four Great Kings (1st)

_Catumahārājasutta_

“On the eighth day of the fortnight, mendicants, the ministers and 1.1
councillors of the four great kings wander about the world, thinking: ‘Hopefully most humans are paying due respect to their parents, ascetics and brahmins, honoring the elders in their families,
observing and keeping vigil on the sabbath, and making merit.’
And on the fourteenth day of the fortnight, the sons of the four 1.3
great kings wander about the world, thinking: ‘Hopefully most
humans are paying due respect to their parents … and making
merit.’
And onthefifteenthdaysabbath, thefourgreatkingsthemselves 1.5
wander about the world, thinking: ‘Hopefully most humans are
paying due respect to their parents … and making merit.’
If only a few humans are paying due respect to their parents … 2.1
andmakingmerit,thefourgreatkingsaddressthegodsofthethirtythree, seated together in the Hall of Justice: Only a few humans are
paying due respect to their parents … and making merit.’ Then the
gods of the thirty-three are disappointed, thinking, ‘The heavenly
hosts will dwindle, while the titan hosts will swell!’
3.1 But if many humans are paying due respect to their parents …
and making merit, the four great kings address the gods of the
thirty-three, seated together in the Hall of Justice: ‘Many humans
are paying due respect to their parents … and making merit.’ Then
the gods of the thirty-three are pleased, thinking, ‘The heavenly
hosts will swell, while the titan hosts will dwindle!’
4.1 Once upon a time, Sakka, lord of gods, guiding the gods of the
thirty-three, recited this verse:

5.1 ‘Whoever wants to be like me
would observe the sabbath
complete in all eight factors,
on the fourteenth and the fifteenth days,
and the eighth day of the fortnight,
as well as on the fortnightly special displays.’

6.1 But that verse was poorly sung by Sakka, lord of gods, not well
sung; poorly spoken, not well spoken. Why is that? Sakka, lord of
gods, is not free of greed, hate, and delusion.
7.1 But for a mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended,
who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be
done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly
endedthe fetterof continuedexistence, andis rightly freedthrough
enlightenment—it is appropriate to say:

8.1 ‘Whoever wants to be like me
would observe the sabbath,
complete in all eight factors,
on the fourteenth and the fifteenth days,
and the eighth day of the fortnight,
as well as on the fortnightly special displays.’

9.1 Why is that? Because that mendicant is free of greed, hate, and
delusion.”
AN 3.38
##### The Four Great Kings (2nd)

_Dutiyacatumahārājasutta_

“Once upon a time, mendicants, Sakka, lord of gods, guiding the 1.1
gods of the thirty-three, recited this verse:

‘Whoever wants to be like me 2.1
would observe the sabbath
complete in all eight factors,
on the fourteenth and the fifteenth days,
and the eighth day of the fortnight,
as well as on the fortnightly special displays.’

But that verse was poorly sung by Sakka, lord of gods, not well 3.1
sung; poorly spoken, not well spoken. Why is that? Because Sakka,
lord of gods, is not exempt from rebirth, old age, and death, from
sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. He is not exempt
from suffering, I say.
But for a mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, 4.1
who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be
done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly
endedthe fetterof continuedexistence, andis rightly freedthrough
enlightenment—it is appropriate to say:

‘Whoever wants to be like me 5.1
would observe the sabbath,
complete in all eight factors,
on the fourteenth and the fifteenth days,
and the eighth day of the fortnight,
as well as on the fortnightly special displays.’

Why is that? Because that mendicant is exempt from rebirth, 6.1
old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and
distress. He is exempt from suffering, I say.”
AN 3.39
##### A Delicate Lifestyle

_Sukhumālasutta_

1.1 “My lifestyle was delicate, mendicants, most delicate, extremely
delicate.
1.2 In my father’s home, lotus ponds were made just for me. In
some, blue water lilies blossomed, while in others, there were pink
or white lotuses, just for my benefit. I only used sandalwood from
Kāsi, and my turbans, jackets, sarongs, and upper robes also came
from Kāsi. And a white parasol was held over me night and day,
with the thought: ‘Don’t let cold, heat, grass, dust, or damp bother
him.’
2.1 I had three stilt longhouses—one for the winter, one for the
summer, and one for the rainy season. I stayed in a stilt longhouse
withoutcomingdownstairsforthefourmonthsoftherainyseason,
where I was entertained by musicians—none of them men.
2.3 While the bondservants, workers, and staff in other houses are
given rough gruel with pickles to eat, in my father’s home they are
given fine rice with meat.
3.1 Amid such prosperity and such a delicate lifestyle, I thought:
‘When an unlearned ordinary person—who is liable to grow old,
not being exempt from old age—sees someone else who is old,
they’re horrified, repelled, and disgusted, overlooking the fact that
they themselves are in the same situation. But since I, too, am liable
to grow old, it would not be appropriate for me to be horrified,
embarrassed, and disgusted, when I see someone else who is old.’
Reflecting like this, I entirely gave up the vanity of youth.
4.1 ‘When an unlearned ordinary person—who is liable to get sick,
not being exempt from sickness—sees someone else who is sick,
they’re horrified, repelled, and disgusted, overlooking the fact that
they themselves are in the same situation. But since I, too, am
liable to get sick, it would not be appropriate for me to be horrified,
embarrassed, and disgusted, when I see someone else who is sick.
Reflecting like this, I entirely gave up the vanity of health.
‘When an unlearned ordinary person—who is liable to die, not 5.1
being exempt from death—sees someone else who is dead, they’re
horrified, repelled, and disgusted, overlooking the fact that they
themselves are in the same situation. But since I, too, am liable to
die,itwouldnotbeappropriateformetobehorrified,embarrassed,
and disgusted, when I see someone else who is dead.’ Reflecting
like this, I entirely gave up the vanity of life.
There are these three vanities. What three? The vanity of youth, 6.1
of health, and of life.
Intoxicated with the vanity of youth, an unlearned ordinary 6.4
person does bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. When
their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a
bad place, the underworld, hell.
Intoxicated with the vanity of health … 6.6
Intoxicated with the vanity of life, an unlearned ordinary person 6.7
does bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their
body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad
place, the underworld, hell.
Intoxicated with the vanity of youth, health, or life, a mendicant 7.1
rejects the training and returns to a lesser life.

For others, sickness is natural, 8.1
and so are old age and death.
Though this is how their nature is,
ordinary people feel disgusted.

If I were to be disgusted 9.1
with creatures whose nature is such,
it would not be appropriate for me,
since my life is just the same.

Living in such a way, 10.1
I understood the truth without attachments.
I mastered all vanities—
of health, of youth,

11.1 and even of life—
seeing renunciation as sanctuary.
Zeal sprang up in me
as I looked to extinguishment.

12.1 Now I’m unable
to indulge in sensual pleasures;
there’s no turning back,
I’m committed to the spiritual life.”

AN 3.40
##### In Charge

_Ādhipateyyasutta_

1.1 “There are, mendicants, these three things to put in charge. What
three? Putting oneself, the world, or the teaching in charge.
1.4 And what, mendicants, is putting oneself in charge? It’s when
a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or
to an empty hut, and reflects like this: ‘I didn’t go forth from the
lay life to homelessness for the sake of a robe, almsfood, lodgings,
or rebirth in this or that state. But I was swamped by rebirth, old
age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
I was swamped by suffering, mired in suffering. And I thought,
“Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.” But it
wouldnotbeappropriateformetoseeksensualpleasureslikethose
I abandoned when I went forth, or even worse.’ Then they reflect:
‘My energy shall be roused up and unflagging, mindfulness shall be
established and lucid, my body shall be tranquil and undisturbed,
and my mind shall be immersed in samādhi.’ Putting themselves
in charge, they give up the unskillful and develop the skillful, they
give up the blameworthy and develop the blameless, and they keep
themselves pure. This is called putting oneself in charge.
And what, mendicants, is putting the world in charge? Its when 2.1
a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or
to an empty hut, and reflects like this: ‘I didn’t go forth from the
lay life to homelessness for the sake of a robe, almsfood, lodgings,
or rebirth in this or that state. But I was swamped by rebirth, old
age, and death, by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
I was swamped by suffering, mired in suffering. And I thought,
“Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.” And
now, since I’ve now gone forth, I might have sensual, malicious,
or cruel thoughts. But the population of the world is large, and
there are ascetics and brahmins who have psychic power—they’re
clairvoyant, and can read the minds of others. They see far without
being seen, even by those close; and they understand the minds of
others. They would know me:
“Look at this gentleman; he’s gone forth out of faith from the lay 2.11
life to homelessness, but he’s living mixed up with bad, unskillful
qualities.” And there are deities, too, who have psychic power—
they’re clairvoyant, and can read the minds of others. They see far
without being seen, even by those close; and they understand the
minds of others. They would know me:
“Look at this gentleman; he’s gone forth out of faith from the lay 2.15
life to homelessness, but he’s living mixed up with bad, unskillful
qualities.”’ Then they reflect: ‘My energy shall be roused up and
unflagging, mindfulness shall be established and lucid, my body
shall be tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind shall be immersed
in samādhi.’ Putting the world in charge, they give up the unskillful
and develop the skillful, they give up the blameworthy and develop
the blameless, and they keep themselves pure. This is called putting
the world in charge.
And what, mendicants, is putting the teaching in charge? It’s 3.1
when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a
tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this: ‘I didn’t go forth
from the lay life to homelessness for the sake of a robe, almsfood,
lodgings, or rebirth in this or that state. But I was swamped by
rebirth, old age, and death, by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness,
and distress. I was swamped by suffering, mired in suffering. And I
thought, “Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.” The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in
the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant,
so that sensible people can know it for themselves. I have spiritual
companions who live knowing and seeing. Now that I’ve gone
forth in this well explained teaching and training, it would not be
appropriate for me to live lazy and heedless.’ Then they reflect:
‘My energy shall be roused up and unflagging, mindfulness shall be
established and lucid, my body shall be tranquil and undisturbed,
and my mind shall be immersed in samādhi.’ Putting the teaching
in charge, they give up the unskillful and develop the skillful, they
give up the blameworthy and develop the blameless, and they keep
themselves pure. This is called putting the teaching in charge.
3.14 These are the three things to put in charge.

4.1 There’s no privacy in the world,
for someone who does bad deeds.
You’ll know for yourself,
whether you’ve lied or told the truth.

5.1 When you witness your good self,
you despise it;
while you disguise
your bad self inside yourself.

6.1 The gods and the Realized One see
the fool who lives unjustly in the world.
So with yourself in charge, live mindfully;
with the world in charge,
be alert and practice absorption;
with the teaching in charge,
live in line with that teaching:
a sage who tries for the truth doesn’t deteriorate.

7.1 Māra’s conquered; the terminator’s overcome:
one who strives reaches the end of rebirth.
Unaffected, intelligent, knowing the world—
that sage is determined by nothing at all.”
# A Short Chapter

AN 3.41
##### Present

_Sammukhībhāvasutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, when three things are present, a faithful gentleman
creates much merit. What three? When faith is present, when a gift
togiveispresent,andwhenthoseworthyofareligiousdonationare
present. When these three things are present, a faithful gentleman
creates much merit.”

AN 3.42
##### Three Grounds

_Tiṭhānasutta_

1.1 “There are three grounds, mendicants, by which a person with faith
and confidence can be known. What three? They like to see ethical
people. They like to hear the true teaching. And they live at home
rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving
to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share. These
are the three grounds by which a person with faith and confidence
can be known.

2.1 They like to see ethical people;
they want to hear the true teaching;
they’ve driven out the stain of stinginess:
thats whos called a person of faith.

AN 3.43
##### Good Reasons

_Atthavasasutta_

“Mendicants, taking three reasons into consideration provides quite 1.1
enough motivation to teach Dhamma to another. What three?
When the teacher understands the meaning and the teaching.
When the audience understands the meaning and the teaching.
When both the teacher and the audience understand the meaning
and the teaching.
Taking these three reasons into consideration provides quite 1.6
enough motivation to teach Dhamma to another.”

AN 3.44
##### When Conversation Flows

_Kathāpavattisutta_

“In three situations, mendicants, conversation flows. What three? 1.1
When the teacher understands the meaning and the teaching.
When the audience understands the meaning and the teaching.
When both the teacher and the audience understand the meaning
and the teaching. These are the three situations in which conversation flows.”

AN 3.45
##### Recommended by the Astute

_Paṇḍitasutta_

“Mendicants, these three things are recommended by astute true 1.1
persons. What three? Giving, going forth, and taking care of your
mother and father. These are the three things recommended by
astute true persons.

2.1 The virtuous recommend giving,
harmlessness, restraint, and self-control;
caring for mother and father,
and peaceful spiritual practitioners.

3.1 These are the things recommended by the good,
which the astute should cultivate.
A noble one, having vision,
will enjoy a world of grace.”

AN 3.46
##### Ethical

_Sīlavantasutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, when ethical renunciates are supported by a town or
village, the people there create much merit in three ways. What
three? Bywayofbody,speech,andmind. Whenethicalrenunciates
are supported by a town or village, the people there create much
merit in these three ways.”

AN 3.47
##### Characteristics of the Conditioned

_Saṅkhatalakkhaṇasutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, the conditioned has these three characteristics. What
three? Arising is evident, vanishing is evident, and change while
persisting is evident. These are the three characteristics of the
conditioned.”
###### Characteristics of the Unconditioned

“The unconditioned has these three characteristics. What three? 2.1
No arising is evident, no vanishing is evident, and no change while
persisting is evident. These are the three characteristics of the
unconditioned.”

AN 3.48
##### The King of Mountains

_Pabbatarājasutta_

“Mendicants, great sal trees grow in three ways supported by the 1.1
Himalayas, the king of mountains. What three? The branches,
leaves, and foliage; the bark and shoots; and the softwood and
heartwood. Great sal trees grow in these three ways supported by
the Himalayas, the king of mountains.
In the same way, a family grows in three ways supported by a 2.1
family head with faith. What three? Faith, ethics, and wisdom. A
family grows in these three ways supported by a family head with
faith.

Supported by the rocky mountain 3.1
in the wilds, the formidable forest,
the tree grows
to become lord of the forest.

So too, when the family head 4.1
is ethical and faithful,
supported by them, they grow:
children, partners, and kin,
colleagues, relatives,
and those dependent for their livelihood.

Seeing the ethical conduct of the virtuous, 5.1
the generosity and good deeds,
those who see clearly
do likewise.

6.1 Having practiced the teaching here,
the path that goes to a good place,
they delight in the heavenly realm,
enjoying all the pleasures they desire.”

AN 3.49
##### Keen

_Ātappakaraṇīyasutta_

1.1 “In three situations, mendicants, you should be keen. What three?
You should be keen to prevent bad, unskillful qualities from arising.
You should be keen to give rise to skillful qualities. And you should
be keen to endure physical pain—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant,
disagreeable, life-threatening. In these three situations, you should
be keen.
2.1 It’s a mendicant who is keen to prevent bad, unskillful qualities
from arising. They’re keen to give rise to skillful qualities. And
they’re keen to endure physical pain—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, life-threatening. This is called a mendicant who
is keen, alert, and mindful so as to rightly make an end of suffering.”

AN 3.50
##### A Master Thief

_Mahācorasutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, a master thief with three factors breaks into houses,
plunders wealth, steals from isolated buildings, and commits highway robbery. What three?
1.3 A master thief relies on uneven ground, on thick cover, and on
powerful individuals. And how does a master thief rely on uneven
ground? It’s when a master thief relies on inaccessible riverlands
or rugged mountains. Thats how a master thief relies on uneven
ground.
And how does a master thief rely on thick cover? It’s when a 2.1
master thief relies on thick grass, thick trees, a blind spot, or a large
forest grove. That’s how a master thief relies on thick cover.
And how does a master thief rely on powerful individuals? It’s 3.1
when a master thief relies on rulers or their chief ministers. They
think: ‘If anyone accuses me of anything, these rulers or their
chief ministers will speak in my defense in the case.’ And that’s
exactly what happens. That’s how a master thief relies on powerful
individuals.
A master thief with these three factors breaks into houses, plun- 3.7
ders wealth, steals from isolated buildings, and commits highway
robbery.
In the same way, when a bad mendicant has three factors, they 4.1
keep themselves broken and damaged. They deserve to be blamed
andcriticizedbysensiblepeople,andtheycreatemuchwickedness.
What three?
A bad mendicant relies on uneven ground, on thick cover, and 4.3
on powerful individuals.
And how does a bad mendicant rely on uneven ground? It’s 5.1
when a bad mendicant has unethical conduct by way of body,
speech, and mind. That’s how a bad mendicant relies on uneven
ground.
And how does a bad mendicant rely on thick cover? It’s when a 6.1
bad mendicant has wrong view, he’s attached to an extremist view.
That’s how a bad mendicant relies on thick cover.
And how does a bad mendicant rely on powerful individuals? 7.1
It’s when a bad mendicant relies on rulers or their chief ministers.
They think: ‘If anyone accuses me of anything, these rulers or
their chief ministers will speak in my defense in the case.’ And
that’s exactly what happens. That’s how a bad mendicant relies on
powerful individuals.
7.7 When abadmendicanthasthesethreequalities, theykeepthem

# The Chapter on Brahmins

AN 3.51
##### Two Brahmins (1st)

_Paṭhamadvebrāhmaṇasutta_

1.1 Then twooldbrahmins—elderlyandsenior, whowereadvancedin
years and had reached the final stage of life, a hundred and twenty
years old—went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with
him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they
sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:
1.3 “We brahmins, Mister Gotama, are old, elderly and senior, we’re
advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; we’re
a hundred and twenty years old. And we haven’t done what is
good and skillful, nor have we made a shelter from fear. Advise us,
Mister Gotama, instruct us! It will be for our lasting welfare and
happiness.”
2.1 “Indeed, brahmins, you’re old, elderly and senior. And you
haven’t done what is good and skillful, nor have you made a shelter
from fear. This world is led on by old age, sickness, and death.
But restraint here by way of body, speech, and mind is the shelter,
protection, island, refuge, and haven for the departed.

3.1 This life, so very short, is led onward.
There’s no shelter for someone
who’s been led on by old age.
Seeing this peril in death,
you should do good deeds that bring happiness.
The restraint practiced here 4.1
of body, speech, and mind—
leads the departed to happiness,
as the good deeds done while living.”

AN 3.52
##### Two Brahmins (2nd)

_Dutiyadvebrāhmaṇasutta_

Then two old brahmins—elderly and senior, who were advanced 1.1
in years and had reached the final stage of life, being a hundred and
twenty years old—went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to the Buddha:
“We brahmins, Mister Gotama, are old, elderly and senior, we’re 1.2
advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; we’re
a hundred and twenty years old. And we haven’t done what is
good and skillful, nor have we made a shelter from fear. Advise us,
Mister Gotama, instruct us! It will be for our lasting welfare and
happiness.”
“Indeed, brahmins, you’re old, elderly and senior. And you 2.1
haven’t done what is good and skillful, nor have you made a shelter
from fear. This world is burning with old age, sickness, and death.
But restraint here by way of body, speech, and mind is the shelter,
protection, island, refuge, and haven for the departed.

When your house is on fire, 3.1
you rescue the pot
that’s useful,
not the one that’s burnt.

And as the world is on fire 4.1
with old age and death,
you should rescue by giving,
for what’s given is rescued.
5.1 The restraint practiced here
of body, speech, and mind—
leads the departed to happiness,
as the good deeds done while living.”

AN 3.53
##### A Certain Brahmin

_Aññatarabrāhmaṇasutta_

1.1 Then a brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings
with him. Seated to one side he said to the Buddha:
1.2 “Mister Gotama,theyspeakof‘ateachingapparentinthepresent
life’. In what way is the teaching apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible
people can know it for themselves?”
2.1 “A greedy person, overcome and overwhelmed by greed, intends
to hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both. They experience
mentalpainandsadness. Whengreedhasbeengivenup, theydon’t
intend to hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both. They don’t
experience mental pain and sadness. This is how the teaching is apparentinthepresentlife, immediatelyeffective, invitinginspection,
relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.
3.1 A hateful person, overcome by hate, intends to hurt themselves,
hurt others, and hurt both. They experience mental pain and sadness. When hate has been given up, they don’t intend to hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both. They don’t experience mental
pain and sadness. This, too, is how the teaching is apparent in the
present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so
that sensible people can know it for themselves.
4.1 A deluded person, overcome by delusion, intends to hurt themselves,hurtothers,andhurtboth. Theyexperiencementalpainand
sadness. When delusion has been given up, they don’t intend to
hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both. They don’t experience
mental pain and sadness. This, too, is how the teaching is apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection,
relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.”
“Excellent, Mister Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting 5.1
the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path
to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes
can see what’s there, Mister Gotama has made the teaching clear in
many ways. I go for refuge to Mister Gotama, to the teaching, and
to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Mister Gotama
remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

AN 3.54
##### A Wanderer

_Paribbājakasutta_

Then a brahmin wanderer went up to the Buddha … Seated to one 1.1
side he said to the Buddha:
“Mister Gotama,theyspeakof‘ateachingapparentinthepresent 1.2
life’. In what way is the teaching apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible
people can know it for themselves?”
“A greedy person, overcome by greed, intends to hurt them- 2.1
selves, hurt others, and hurt both. They experience mental pain
and sadness. When greed has been given up, they don’t intend to
hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both. They don’t experience
mental pain and sadness.
A greedy person does bad things by way of body, speech, and 3.1
mind. When greed has been given up, they don’t do bad things by
way of body, speech, and mind.
A greedy person doesn’t truly understand what’s for their own 4.1
good, the good of another, or the good of both. When greed has
been given up, they truly understand what’s for their own good, the
good of another, or the good of both. This is how the teaching is apparentinthepresentlife, immediatelyeffective, invitinginspection,
relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.
5.1 A hateful person … A deluded person, overcome by delusion,
intends to hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both. They experience mental pain and sadness. When delusion has been given up,
they don’t intend to hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both.
They don’t experience mental pain and sadness.
6.1 A deluded person does bad things by way of body, speech, and
mind. When delusion has been given up, they don’t do bad things
by way of body, speech, and mind.
7.1 A deluded person doesn’t truly understand what’s for their own
good, the good of another, or the good of both. When delusion has
been given up, they truly understand what’s for their own good,
the good of another, or the good of both. This, too, is how the
teaching is apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for
themselves.”
8.1 “Excellent, Mister Gotama! Excellent! … From this day forth,
may Mister Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone
for refuge for life.”

AN 3.55
##### Quenched

_Nibbutasutta_

1.1 Then the brahmin Jānussoṇi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat
down to one side, and said to the Buddha:
1.2 “Mister Gotama, they say that ‘extinguishment is apparent in
the present life’. In what way is extinguishment apparent in the
present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so
that sensible people can know it for themselves?”
2.1 “A greedy person, overcome by greed, intends to hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both. They experience mental pain
and sadness. When greed has been given up, they don’t intend to
hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both. They don’t experience
mental pain and sadness. This is how extinguishment is apparent
in the present life.
A hateful person … 3.1
A deluded person, overcome by delusion, intends to hurt them- 3.2
selves, hurt others, and hurt both. They experience mental pain
and sadness. When delusion has been given up, they don’t intend
to hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both. They don’t experience mental pain and sadness. This, too, is how extinguishment is
apparent in the present life.
When you experience the ending of greed, hate, and delusion 4.1
withoutanythingleftover, that’showextinguishmentisapparentin
the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant,
so that sensible people can know it for themselves.”
“Excellent, Mister Gotama! Excellent! … From this day forth, 5.1
may Mister Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone
for refuge for life.”

AN 3.56
##### Falling Apart

_Palokasutta_

Then a well-to-do Brahmin went up to the Buddha, and seated to 1.1
one side he said to him:
“Mister Gotama, I have heard that brahmins of the past who 1.2
were elderly and senior, the tutors of tutors, said: ‘In the old days
this world was so full of people you’d think they were squashed
together. The villages, towns and capital cities were no more than a
chicken’s flight apart.’ What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why
these days human numbers have dwindled, a decline in population
is evident, and whole villages, towns, cities, and countries have
disappeared?”
“These days, brahmin, humans just love illicit desire. They’re 2.1
overcome by immoral greed, and mired in wrong custom. Taking
up sharp knives, they murder each other. And so many people
perish. This is the cause, this is the reason why these days human
numbers have dwindled.
3.1 Furthermore, because these days humans just love illicit desire
… the heavens don’t provide enough rain, so there’s famine, a bad
harvest, with blighted crops that turn to straw. And so many people
perish. This is the cause, this is the reason why these days human
numbers have dwindled.
4.1 Furthermore, because these days humans just love illicit desire
… native spirits let vicious monsters loose. And so many people
perish. This is the cause, this is the reason why these days human
numbers have dwindled.”
5.1 “Excellent, Mister Gotama! Excellent! … From this day forth,
may Mister Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone
for refuge for life.”

AN 3.57
##### With Vacchagotta

_Vacchagottasutta_

1.1 Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversationwereover,hesatdowntoonesideandsaidtotheBuddha:
1.3 “I have heard, Mister Gotama, that the ascetic Gotama says this:
‘Gifts should only be given to me, not to others. Gifts should only
be given to my disciples, not to the disciples of others. Only what
is given to me is very fruitful, not what is given to others. Only
what is given to my disciples is very fruitful, not what is given to
the disciples of others.’
1.13 I trust that those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said,
and do not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation
in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for
rebuttal and criticism? For we don’t want to misrepresent Mister
Gotama.”
Vaccha, those who say this do not repeat what I have said. They 2.1
misrepresent me with what is false and untrue.
Anyone who prevents another from giving makes an obstacle 2.6
and a roadblock for three people. What three? The giver is obstructed from making merit. The receiver is obstructed from getting what is offered. And they’ve already broken and damaged
themselves. Anyone who prevents another from giving makes an
obstacle and a roadblock for these three people.
Vaccha, this is what I say: ‘You even make merit by tipping out 3.1
dish-washing water in a cesspool or a sump with living creatures in
it, thinking, “May any creatures here be nourished!”’ How much
more then for human beings!
However, I also say that a gift to an ethical person is more fruitful 3.5
than one to an unethical person. They’ve given up five factors, and
possess five factors.
What are the five factors they’ve given up? Sensual desire, ill 4.1
will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt.
These are the five factors they’ve given up.
What are the five factors they possess? The entire spectrum of 5.1
an adept’s ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and knowledge
and vision of freedom. These are the five factors they possess.
I say that a gift to anyone who has given up these five factors and 5.4
possesses these five factors is very fruitful.

Cows may be black or white, 6.1
red or tawny,
mottled or uniform,
or pigeon-colored.

But when one is born among them, 7.1
the bull that’s tamed—
a behemoth, powerful,
well-paced in pulling forward—
they yoke the load just to him,
regardless of his color.
8.1 So it is for humans,
wherever they may be born—
among aristocrats, brahmins, peasants,
menials, or corpse-workers and scavengers—

9.1 one is born among them,
tamed, true to their vows.
Firm in principle, accomplished in ethical conduct,
truthful, conscientious,

10.1 they’ve given up birth and death.
Complete in the spiritual journey,
with burden put down, detached,
they’ve completed the task
and are free of defilements.

11.1 Gone beyond all things,
they’re quenched by not grasping.
In that flawless field,
a religious donation is abundant.

12.1 Fools who don’t understand—
unlearned simpletons—
give their gifts to those outside,
and don’t attend the peaceful ones.

13.1 But those who do attend the peaceful ones—
wise, esteemed as attentive—
and whose faith in the Holy One
has roots planted deep,

14.1 they go to the realm of the gods,
or are born here in a good family.
Gradually those astute ones
reach extinguishment.”
AN 3.58
##### With Tikaṇṇa

_Tikaṇṇasutta_

Then Tikaṇṇa the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged 1.1
greetingswithhim. Seatedtooneside, infrontoftheBuddha, Tikaṇṇa praised the brahmins who were proficient in the three Vedas,
“Such are the brahmins, masters of the three Vedic knowledges!
Thus are the brahmins, masters of the three Vedic knowledges!”
“But brahmin, how do the brahmins describe a brahmin who is 2.1
master of the three Vedic knowledges?”
“Mister Gotama, it’s when a brahmin is well born on both his 2.2
mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and
impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation.
He recites and remembers the hymns, and has mastered the three
Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance,
their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as
fifth. He knows them word-by-word, and their grammar. He is
well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. That’s how
the brahmins describe a brahmin who is master of the three Vedic
knowledges.”
“Brahmin, a master of three knowledges according to the brah- 3.1
mins is quite different from a master of the three knowledges in
the training of the Noble One.”
“But Mister Gotama, how is one a master of the three knowl- 3.2
edges in the training of the Noble One? Mister Gotama, please
teach me this.”
“Well then, brahmin, listen and apply your mind well, I will 3.4
speak.”
“Yes sir,” Tikaṇṇa replied. The Buddha said this: 3.5
“Brahmin, it’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual 4.1
pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains
in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of
seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As
the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they
enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture
and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one,
without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the
fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware,
personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare,
‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ With the giving
up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and
sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without
pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
5.1 When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—
purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable,
steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection
of past lives. They recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one,
two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a
thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world
contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the
world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was
named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my
food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how
my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn
somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I
looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure
and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away
from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many
kinds of past lives, with features and details. This is the first knowledge that they attain. Ignorance is destroyed and knowledge has
arisen; darkness is destroyed and light has arisen, as happens for a
meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.
6.1 When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—
purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable,
steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of
the death and rebirth of sentient beings. With clairvoyance that is
purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away
and being reborn inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a
good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings
are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad
things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the
noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of
that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re
reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These
dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech,
and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right
view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body
breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly
realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman,
they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior
and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place.
They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their
deeds. This is the second knowledge that they attain. Ignorance
is destroyed and knowledge has arisen; darkness is destroyed and
light has arisen, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen,
and resolute.
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this— 7.1
purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable,
steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of
the ending of defilements. They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’
… ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This
is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’. Knowing
and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of
sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. When they’re freed,
they know they’re freed.
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has 7.6
been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’ This is the third knowledge that they
attain. Ignorance is destroyed and knowledge has arisen; darkness
is destroyed, and light has arisen, as happens for a meditator who
is diligent, keen, and resolute.

8.1 For someone whose ethical conduct doesn’t waver,
who is alert, practicing absorption;
whose mind is mastered,
unified, serene.

9.1 That attentive one dispels the darkness,
master of the three knowledges, conqueror of death.
For the welfare of gods and humans,
he has given up everything, they say.

10.1 Accomplished in the three knowledges,
living without confusion,
bearing the final body,
they revere the awakened Gotama.

11.1 One who knows their past lives,
sees heaven and places of loss,
and has attained the ending of rebirth,
a sage of perfect insight—

12.1 it’s because of these three knowledges
that a brahmin is a master of the three knowledges.
That’s who I call a three-knowledge master,
and not the other
who repeats what they are told.

13.1 This, brahmin, isamasterofthethreeknowledgesinthetraining
of the Noble One.”
13.2 “Mister Gotama, a master of three knowledges according to the
brahmins is quite different from a master of the three knowledges
in the training of the Noble One. And, Mister Gotama, a master
of three knowledges according to the brahmins is not worth a
sixteenth part of a master of the three knowledges in the training
of the Noble One.
Excellent, Mister Gotama! Excellent! … From this day forth, 14.1
may Mister Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone
for refuge for life.”

##### With Jānussoṇi

_Jāṇussoṇisutta_

Then thebrahminJānussoṇiwentuptotheBuddha,andexchanged 1.1
greetings with him. Seated to one side he said to the Buddha:
“Mister Gotama, whoever has a sacrifice, an offering of food for 1.2
ancestors, a dish of milk-rice prepared for an auspicious ceremony,
or a gift to give, should give it to the brahmins who have mastered
the three Vedic knowledges.”
“But brahmin, how do the brahmins describe a brahmin who is 1.3
proficient in the three Vedic knowledges?”
“Mister Gotama, it’s when a brahmin is well born on both his 1.4
mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and
impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation.
He recites and remembers the hymns, and has mastered the three
Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance,
their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as

“But Mister Gotama, how is one a master of the three knowl- 2.2
edges in the training of the Noble One? Mister Gotama, please
teach me this.”
“Well then, brahmin, listen and apply your mind well, I will 2.4
speak.”
2.5 Yes sir, Jānussoṇi replied. The Buddha said this:
3.1 “Brahmin, it’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual
pleasures … enters and remains in the fourth absorption.
4.1 When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—
purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable,

is purified and surpasses the human, they understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. This is the second

One who is perfect in precepts and observances, 7.1
resolute and serene,
whose mind is mastered,
unified, serene;

who knows their past lives, 8.1
sees heaven and places of loss,
and has attained the end of rebirth,
such a sage has perfect insight.

Because of these three knowledges 9.1
a brahmin is a master of the three knowledges.
That’s who I call a three-knowledge master,
and not the other
who repeats what they are told.

This, brahmin, isamasterofthethreeknowledgesinthetraining 10.1

“Mister Gotama, the master of three knowledges according to 10.2
the brahmins is quite different from a master of the three knowledges in the training of the Noble One. And, Mister Gotama, a
master of three knowledges according to the brahmins is not worth
a sixteenth part of a master of the three knowledges in the training

Excellent, Mister Gotama! Excellent! … From this day forth, 11.1
may Mister Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone

AN 3.60
##### With Saṅgārava

_Saṅgāravasutta_

1.1 Then Saṅgārava the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversationwereover,hesatdowntoonesideandsaidtotheBuddha:
1.3 “Mister Gotama, we who are called brahmins make sacrifices
and encourage others to make sacrifices. Now, Mister Gotama,
both of these people—the one who sacrifices and the one who
encourages others to sacrifice—are doing good for many people
on account of that sacrifice. But, Mister Gotama, when someone
has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness, they tame, calm,
and extinguish themselves alone. That being so, they are doing
good for just one person on account of that going forth.”
2.1 “Well then, brahmin, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you
can answer as you like. What do you think, brahmin? A Realized
One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world,
supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and
humans, awakened, blessed. He says, ‘Come, this is the path, this
is the practice. Practicing like this, I realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual life with my own insight, and I make it known.
Please, all of you, practice like this, and you too will realize the
supreme culmination of the spiritual life, and will live having realized it with your own insight.’ So the teacher teaches Dhamma,
and others practice accordingly, in their hundreds and thousands,
and hundreds of thousands.
3.1 What doyouthink, brahmin? This beingso, arethey doinggood
for just one person or for many people on account of going forth?”
3.3 “This being so, Mister Gotama, they are doing good for many
people on account of going forth.”
When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to Saṅgārava, Brah 4.1
min, which of these two practices do you believe has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?”
Saṅgārava said to Ānanda, “Those such as misters Gotama and 4.3
Ānanda are honored and praised by me!”
For a second time, Ānanda said to Saṅgārava, “Brahmin, I didn’t 5.1
ask you who you honor and praise. I asked you which of these two
practices do you believe has fewer requirements and undertakings,
yet is more fruitful and beneficial?”
For a second time Saṅgārava said to Ānanda, “Those such as 5.6
misters Gotama and Ānanda are honored and praised by me!”
For a third time, Ānanda said to Saṅgārava, “Brahmin, I didn’t 6.1
ask you who you honor and praise. I asked you which of these two
practices do you believe has fewer requirements and undertakings,
yet is more fruitful and beneficial?”
For a third time Saṅgārava said to Ānanda, “Those such as mis- 6.6
ters Gotama and Ānanda are honored and praised by me!”
Then it occurred to the Buddha, “Though Ānanda asked him a 7.1
sensible question three times, Saṅgārava falters without answering.
Why don’t I give him a way out?”
So the Buddha said to Saṅgārava, “Brahmin, what came up in 7.4
the conversation among the king’s retinue today, sitting together
in the royal compound?”
“Mister Gotama, this came up: ‘Formerly, it seems, there 7.6
were fewer mendicants, but more of them displayed superhuman
demonstrations of psychic power; while these days, there are more
mendicants, but fewer display superhuman demonstrations of psychic power.’ This is what came up in the conversation among the
king’s retinue today, while sitting together in the royal compound.”
“Brahmin, there are three kinds of demonstration. What three? 8.1
A demonstration of psychic power, a demonstration of revealing,
and a demonstration of instruction.
And what is the demonstration of psychic power? It’s when 8.4
someone wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying
themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing;
going unobstructed through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if
through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water;
walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through
the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun
and moon, so mighty and powerful. They control the body as far
as the realm of divinity. This is called the demonstration of psychic
power.
9.1 And what is the demonstration of revealing? In one case, someone reveals by means of a sign: ‘This is what you’re thinking, such
is your thought, and thus is your state of mind.’ And even if they
reveal this many times, it turns out exactly so, not otherwise.
10.1 In another case, someone reveals after hearing it from humans
or non-humans or deities: ‘This is what you’re thinking, such is
your thought, and thus is your state of mind.’ And even if they
reveal this many times, it turns out exactly so, not otherwise.
11.1 In another case, someone reveals by hearing the sound of
thought spreading as someone thinks and considers: ‘This is what
you’rethinking, suchisyourthought, andthusisyourstateofmind.’
And even if they reveal this many times, it turns out exactly so, not
otherwise.
12.1 In another case, someone comprehends the mind of a person
who has attained the immersion that’s free of placing the mind
and keeping it connected. They understand: ‘Judging by the way
this person’s intentions are directed, immediately after this mind
state, they’ll think this thought.’ And even if they reveal this many
times, it turns out exactly so, not otherwise. This is called the
demonstration of revealing.
13.1 And what is a demonstration of instruction? It’s when someone
instructs others like this: ‘Think like this, not like that. Focus your
mind like this, not like that. Give up this, and live having achieved
that.’ This is called a demonstration of instruction.
13.5 These arethe three kinds of demonstration. Of these threekinds
of demonstration, which do you consider to be the finest?”
Regarding this, Mister Gotama, a demonstration of psychic 14.1
power is experienced only by the one who performs it, occurring
only to them. This seems to me like a magic trick.
And the demonstration where someone reveals something by 15.1
means of a sign, or after hearing it from humans, non-humans, or
deities, or by hearing the sound of thought spreading as someone
thinks and considers, or by comprehending the mind of another
person, is also experienced only by the one who performs it, occurring only to them. This also seems to me like a magic trick.
But as to the demonstration where someone instructs others: 16.1
‘Think like this, not like that. Focus your mind like this, not like
that. Give up this, and live having achieved that.’ I prefer this
demonstration, Mister Gotama. It’s the finest of the three kinds of
demonstration.
It’s incredible, Mister Gotama, it’s amazing, how well this was 17.1
said by Mister Gotama. Weregard MisterGotama as someone who
possesses these three kinds of demonstration. For Mister Gotama
wields the many kinds of psychic power … controlling the body
as far as the realm of divinity. And Mister Gotama comprehends
the mind of another person who has attained the immersion that
is free of placing the mind and keeping it connected. He understands: ‘Judging by the way this person’s intentions are directed,
immediately after this mind state they’ll think this thought.’ And
Mister Gotama instructs others like this: ‘Think like this, not like
that. Focus your mind like this, not like that. Give up this, and live
having achieved that.’”
“Your words are clearly invasive and intrusive, brahmin. Nev- 18.1
ertheless, I will answer you. For I do wield the many kinds of
psychic power … controlling the body as far as the realm of divinity. And I do comprehend the mind of another person who has
attained the immersion that is free of placing the mind and keeping it connected. I understand: ‘Judging by the way this person’s
intentions are directed, immediately after this mind state they’ll
think this thought.’ And I do instruct others like this: ‘Think like
this, not like that. Focus your mind like this, not like that. Give up
this, and live having achieved that.’”
19.1 “But Mister Gotama, is there even one other mendicant who
possesses these three kinds of demonstration, apart from Mister
Gotama?”
19.2 “There’s not just one hundred mendicants, brahmin, who possess these three kinds of demonstration, nor two, three, four, or
five hundred, but many more than that.”
19.3 “But where are these mendicants now staying?”
19.4 “Right here, brahmin, in this Saṅgha of mendicants.”
20.1 “Excellent, Mister Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting
the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path
to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes
can see what’s there, Mister Gotama has made the teaching clear in
many ways. I go for refuge to Mister Gotama, to the teaching, and
to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Mister Gotama
remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
# The Great Chapter

AN 3.61
##### Sectarian Tenets

_Titthāyatanasutta_

“Mendicants, these three sectarian tenets—as pursued, pressed, 1.1
and grilled by the astute—when taken to their conclusion, end
with inaction. What three?
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine 1.3
and view: ‘Everything this individual experiences—pleasurable,
painful, or neutral—is because of past deeds.’
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine 1.5
and view: ‘Everything this individual experiences—pleasurable,
painful, or neutral—is because of God Almighty’s creation.’
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine 1.7
and view: ‘Everything this individual experiences—pleasurable,
painful, or neutral—has no cause or reason.’
Regarding this, I went up to the ascetics and brahmins whose 2.1
view is that everything that is experienced is because of past deeds,
and I said to them: ‘Is it really true that this is the venerables’ view?’
Andtheyanswered,‘Yes’. Isaidtothem: ‘Inthatcase,youmightkill
living creatures, steal, be unchaste; use speech that’s false, divisive,
harsh, or nonsensical; be covetous, malicious, or have wrong view,
all because of past deeds.’
Those who believe that past deeds are the most important thing 3.1
have no enthusiasm or effort, no idea that there are things that
should and should not be done. Since they don t actually find
that there are things that should and should not be done, they’re
unmindful and careless, and can’t rightly be called ascetics. This
is my first legitimate refutation of the ascetics and brahmins who
have this doctrine and view.
4.1 Regarding this, I went up to the ascetics and brahmins whose
view is that everything that is experienced is because of God
Almighty’s creation, and I said to them: ‘Is it really true that this
is the venerables’ view?’ And they answered, ‘Yes’. I said to them:
‘In that case, you might kill living creatures, steal, be unchaste; use
speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; be covetous,
malicious, or have wrong view, all because of God Almighty’s creation.’
5.1 Those who believe that God Almighty’s creative power is the
most important thing have no enthusiasm, no effort, no idea that
there are things that should and should not be done. Since they
don’t actually find that there are things that should and should not
be done, they’re unmindful and careless, and can’t rightly be called
ascetics. This is my second legitimate refutation of the ascetics and
brahmins who have this doctrine and view.
6.1 Regarding this, I went up to the ascetics and brahmins whose
view is that everything that is experienced has no cause or reason,
and I said to them: ‘Is it really true that this is the venerables’ view?’
Andtheyanswered,‘Yes’. Isaidtothem: ‘Inthatcase,youmightkill
living creatures, steal, be unchaste; use speech that’s false, divisive,
harsh, or nonsensical; be covetous, malicious, or have wrong view,
all without cause or reason.’
7.1 Those who believe that the absence of cause or reason is the
most important thing have no enthusiasm, no effort, no idea that
there are things that should and should not be done. Since they
don’t actually find that there are things that should and should not
be done, they’re unmindful and careless, and can’t rightly be called
ascetics. This is my third legitimate refutation of the ascetics and
brahmins who have this doctrine and view.
These are the three sectarian tenets as pursued, pressed, and 8.1
grilled by the astute—which, when taken to their conclusion, end
with inaction.
But the Dhamma that I’ve taught is irrefutable, uncorrupted, be- 9.1
yond reproach, and not scorned by sensible ascetics and brahmins.
What is the Dhamma that I’ve taught?
‘These are the six elements’: this is the Dhamma I’ve taught … 9.3
‘These are the six fields of contact’: this is the Dhamma I’ve 9.4
taught …
‘These are the eighteen mental preoccupations’: this is the 9.5
Dhamma I’ve taught …
‘These are the four noble truths’: this is the Dhamma I’ve 9.6
taught that is irrefutable, uncorrupted, beyond reproach, and is
not scorned by sensible ascetics and brahmins.
‘“These are the six elements”: this is the Dhamma I’ve taught 10.1
…’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
There are these six elements: the elements of earth, water, fire, 10.4
air, space, and consciousness.
‘“These are the six elements”: this is the Dhamma I’ve taught 10.6
…’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
‘“These are the six fields of contact”: this is the Dhamma I’ve 11.1
taught …’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
There are these six fields of contact: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, 11.4
and mind contact.
‘“These are the six fields of contact”: this is the Dhamma I’ve 11.6
taught …’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
‘“These are the eighteen mental preoccupations”: this is the 12.1
Dhamma I’ve taught …’ This is what I said, but why did I say it?
Seeing a sight with the eye, one is preoccupied with a sight that’s 12.4
a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimity.
Hearing a sound with the ear … 12.5
Smelling an odor with the nose … 12.6
Tasting a flavor with the tongue … 12.7
Feeling a touch with the body … 12.8
12.9 Becoming conscious of an idea with the mind, one is preoc
cupied with an idea that’s a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimity.
12.10 ‘“These are the eighteen mental preoccupations”: this is the
Dhamma I’ve taught …’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
13.1 ‘“These are the four noble truths”: this is the Dhamma I’ve
taught …’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
13.4 Supported by the six elements, an embryo is conceived. When
it is conceived, there are name and form. Name and form are
conditionsforthesixsensefields. Thesixsensefieldsareconditions
for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. It’s for one who feels
that I declare: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’
… ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that
leads to the cessation of suffering’.
14.1 And what is the noble truth of suffering? Rebirth is suffering;
old age is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain,
sadness, and distress are suffering; association with the disliked is
suffering; separation from the liked is suffering; not getting what
you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are
suffering. This is called the noble truth of suffering.
15.1 And what is the noble truth of the origin of suffering? Ignorance
is a condition for choices. Choices are a condition for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and
form are conditions for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are
conditions for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is
a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence
is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and
death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come
to be. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. This is
called the noble truth of the origin of suffering.
16.1 And what is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering? When
ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices
cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and form
cease, the six sense fields cease. When the six sense fields cease,
contact ceases. When contact ceases, feeling ceases. When feeling ceases, craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases.
When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age
and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease.
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases. This is called the
noble truth of the cessation of suffering.
And what is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the 17.1
cessation of suffering? It is simply this noble eightfold path, that
is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. This is
called the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of
suffering.
‘“These are the four noble truths”: this is the Dhamma I’ve 17.5
taught that is irrefutable, uncorrupted, beyond reproach, and is
not scorned by sensible ascetics and brahmins.’ That’s what I said,
and this is why I said it.”

AN 3.62
##### Perils

_Bhayasutta_

“Mendicants, an unlearned ordinary person speaks of three perils 1.1
that tear mothers and children apart. What three?
There comes a time when a great fire flares up, and it burns 1.3
villages, towns, and cities. When this happens, a mother can’t find
her child, and a child can’t find their mother. This is the first peril
that tears mothers and children apart.
Furthermore, there comes a time when a great storm gathers, 2.1
and it unleashes a mighty flood that sweeps away villages, towns,
and cities. When this happens, a mother can’t find her child, and
a child can’t find their mother. This is the second peril that tears

3.1 Furthermore, there comes a time of peril due to turmoil in the
wilds, so the countryfolk mount their vehicles and flee everywhere.
When this happens, a mother can’t find her child, and a child can’t
find their mother. This is the third peril that tears mothers and
children apart.
3.4 These are the three perils an unlearned ordinary person speaks
of that tear mothers and children apart.
4.1 Mendicants, an unlearned ordinary person speaks of three perils
that don’t tear mothers and children apart. What three?
4.3 There comes a time when a great fire flares up, and it burns
villages,towns,andcities. Whenthishappens,sometimesamother
can find her child, and a child can find their mother. This is the
first peril that doesn’t tear mothers and children apart.
5.1 Furthermore, there comes a time when a great storm gathers,
and it unleashes a mighty flood that sweeps away villages, towns,
and cities. When this happens, sometimes a mother can find her
child, and a child can find their mother. This is the second peril
that doesn’t tear mothers and children apart.
6.1 Furthermore, there comes a time of peril due to turmoil in the

7.1 There arethreeperilsthattearmothersandchildrenapart. What
three?
7.3 The perils of old age, sickness, and death. When a child is growing old, a mother doesn’t get her wish: ‘Let me grow old, may my
child not grow old!’ When a mother is growing old, a child doesn’t
get their wish: ‘Let me grow old, may my mother not grow old!’
8.1 When a child is sick, a mother doesn’t get her wish: ‘Let me be

When a child is dying, a mother doesn t get her wish: Let me 9.1
die, may my child not die!’ When a mother is dying, a child doesn’t
get their wish: ‘Let me die, may my mother not die!’ These are the
three perils that tear mothers and children apart.
There is a path and a practice that leads to giving up and going 10.1
beyond the three perils that don’t tear mothers and children apart,
and the three perils that do tear mothers and children apart. What
is that path and practice? It is simply this noble eightfold path,
that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right
livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
This is the path, this is the practice that leads to giving up and going
beyond the three perils that don’t tear mothers and children apart,
and the three perils that do tear mothers and children apart.”

##### At Venāgapura

_Venāgapurasutta_

At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans 1.1
together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a
village of the Kosalan brahmins named Venāgapura. The brahmins
and householders of Venāgapura heard:
“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a 1.3
Sakyan family—has arrived at Venāgapura. He has this good reputation: ‘ThatBlessedOneisperfected,afullyawakenedBuddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world,
supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and
humans, awakened, blessed.’ He has realized with his own insight
this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population
with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes
it known to others. He proclaims a teaching that is good in the
beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful
and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely
full and pure. It’s good to see such perfected ones.”
2.1 Then the brahmins and householders of Venāgapura went up to
the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some
exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their
joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and
clan, while some kept silent. Then the brahmin Vacchagotta of
Venāgapura said to the Buddha:
3.1 “It’s incredible, Mister Gotama, it’s amazing, how your faculties
are so very clear, and the complexion of your skin is pure and
bright. It’s like a golden brown jujube in the autumn, or a palm
fruit freshly plucked from the stalk, or a pendant of Black Plum
River gold, fashioned by a deft smith, well-wrought in the forge,
and placed on a cream rug where it shines and glows and radiates.
Inthesameway,yourfacultiesaresoveryclear,andthecomplexion
of your skin is pure and bright.
3.9 Surely Mister Gotama gets when he wants, without trouble or
difficulty, various kinds of high and luxurious bedding, such as:
sofas, couches, woolen covers—shag-piled, colorful, white, embroidered with flowers, quilted, embroidered with animals, doubleor single-fringed—and silk covers studded with gems, as well as
silken sheets, woven carpets, rugs for elephants, horses, or chariots,
antelope hide rugs, and spreads of fine deer hide, with a canopy
above and red cushions at both ends.”
4.1 “Brahmin, these various kinds of high and luxurious bedding are
hard for renunciates to find. And even if they do get them, they’re
not allowed.
5.1 There are, brahmin, these three high and luxurious beds that I
get these days when I want, without trouble or difficulty. What
three? The heavenly high and luxurious bed, the divine high and
luxurious bed, and the noble high and luxurious bed. These are the
three high and luxurious beds that I get these days when I want,
without trouble or difficulty.”
6.1 “But what, Mister Gotama, is the heavenly high and luxurious
bed?”
6.2 “Brahmin, when I am living supported by a village or town, I
robe up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, enter the
town or village for alms. After the meal, on my return from alm
sround, I enter within a forest. I gather up some grass or leaves
into a pile and sit down cross-legged, setting my body straight,
and establishing mindfulness in my presence. Quite secluded from
sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of
seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the
placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, I enter and
remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss
born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without
placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the fading
away of rapture, I enter and remain in the third absorption, where
I meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and
mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ With the giving up of pleasure and
pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, I enter and
remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with
pure equanimity and mindfulness. When I’m practicing like this,
if I walk, at that time my walking is heavenly. When I’m practicing
like this, if I stand, at that time my standing is heavenly. When
I’m practicing like this, if I sit, at that time my sitting is heavenly.
When I’m practicing like this, if I lie down, at that time my lying
is heavenly. This is the heavenly high and luxurious bed that I get
these days when I want, without trouble or difficulty.”
“It’s incredible, Mister Gotama, it’s amazing! Who but Mister 7.1
Gotama could get such a heavenly high and luxurious bed when
he wants, without trouble or difficulty?
But what, Mister Gotama, is the divine high and luxurious bed?” 8.1
“Brahmin, when I am living supported by a village or town, I 8.2
robe up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, enter the
town or village for alms. After the meal, on my return from almsround, I enter within a forest. I gather up some grass or leaves
into a pile and sit down cross-legged, setting my body straight, and
establishing mindfulness in my presence. I meditate spreading a
heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the
third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across,
everywhere, all around, I spread a heart full of love to the whole
world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
I meditate spreading a heart full of compassion to one direction,
and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same
way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, I spread a heart
full of compassion to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. I meditate spreading a heart full of
rejoicing to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and
to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere,
all around, I spread a heart full of rejoicing to the whole world—
abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. I meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to
the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way
above, below, across, everywhere, all around, I spread a heart full
of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless,
free of enmity and ill will. When I’m practicing like this, if I walk,
at that time my walking is divine. … my standing is divine. … my
sitting is divine. When I’m practicing like this, if I lie down, at that
time my lying is divine. This is the divine high and luxurious bed
that I get these days when I want, without trouble or difficulty.”
9.1 “It’s incredible, Mister Gotama, it’s amazing! Who but Mister
Gotama could get such a divine high and luxurious bed when he
wants, without trouble or difficulty?
10.1 “But what, Mister Gotama, is the noble high and luxurious bed?”
10.2 “Brahmin, when I am living supported by a village or town,
I robe up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, enter
the town or village for alms. After the meal, on my return from
almsround, I enter within a forest. I gather up some grass or leaves
into a pile and sit down cross-legged, setting my body straight, and
establishing mindfulness in his presence. I know this: ‘I’ve given
up greed, hate, and delusion, cut them off at the root, made them
like a palm stump, obliterated them, so they’re unable to arise in
the future.’ When I’m practicing like this, if I walk, at that time my
walking is noble. … my standing is noble. … my sitting is noble.
When I m practicing like this, if I lie down, at that time my lying
is noble. This is the noble high and luxurious bed that I get these
days when I want, without trouble or difficulty.”
“It’s incredible, Mister Gotama, it’s amazing! Who but Mister 11.1
Gotama could get such a noble high and luxurious bed when he
wants, without trouble or difficulty?
Excellent, Mister Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the 12.1
overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the
lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see
what’s there, Mister Gotama has made the teaching clear in many
ways. We go for refuge to Mister Gotama, to the teaching, and to
the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Mister Gotama
remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.”

AN 3.64
##### With Sarabha

_Sarabhasutta_

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near 1.1
Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.
Now at that time a wanderer called Sarabha had recently left 1.3
this teaching and training. He was telling a crowd in Rājagaha, “I
learned the teaching of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan, then I
left their teaching and training.”
Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking 1.7
their bowls and robes, entered Rājagaha for alms. They heard what
Sarabha was saying.
Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they 2.1
went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to
him, “The wanderer called Sarabha has recently left this teaching
and training. He was telling a crowd in Rājagaha: ‘I learned the
teaching of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan, then I left their
teaching and training.’ Sir, please go to the wanderers’ monastery
on the banks of the Sappinī river to see Sarabha the wanderer out
of sympathy.” The Buddha consented with silence.
3.1 Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and
went to the wanderers’ monastery on the banks of the Sappinī river
to visit Sarabha the wanderer. He sat on the seat spread out, and
said to the wanderer Sarabha, “Is it really true, Sarabha, that you’ve
been saying: ‘I learned the teaching of the ascetics who follow the
Sakyan, then I left their teaching and training.’” When he said this,
Sarabha kept silent.
4.1 For a second time, the Buddha said to Sarabha, “Tell me,
Sarabha, what exactly have you learned of the teachings of the
ascetics who follow the Sakyan? If you’ve not learned it fully, I’ll
fill you in. But if you have learned it fully, I’ll agree.” For a second
time, Sarabha kept silent.
5.1 For a third time, the Buddha said to Sarabha, “Sarabha, the
teachings of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan are clear to me.
What exactly have you learned of the teachings of the ascetics who
follow the Sakyan? If you’ve not learned it fully, I’ll fill you in. But
if you have learned it fully, I’ll agree.” For a third time, Sarabha kept
silent.
6.1 Then those wanderers said to Sarabha, “The ascetic Gotama has
offered to tell you anything you ask for. Speak, reverend Sarabha,
what exactly have you learned of the teachings of the ascetics who
follow the Sakyan? If you’ve not learned it fully, he’ll fill you in. But
if you have learned it fully, he’ll agree.” When this was said, Sarabha
sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed,
with nothing to say.
7.1 Knowing this, the Buddha said to the wanderers:
8.1 “Wanderers, someone might say to me: ‘You claim to be a fully
awakenedBuddha, butyoudon’tunderstandthesethings.’ ThenI’d
carefully pursue, press, and grill them on that point. When grilled
by me, they would, without a doubt, fall into one of these three
categories. They’d dodge the issue, distracting the discussion with
irrelevant points. They’d display annoyance, hate, and bitterness.
Or they d sit silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, de
pressed, with nothing to say, like Sarabha.
Wanderers, someone might say to me: ‘You claim to have ended 9.1
all defilements, but you still have these defilements.’ Then I’d carefully pursue, press, and grill them on that point. When grilled by
me, they would, without a doubt, fall into one of these three categories. They’d dodge the issue, distracting the discussion with
irrelevant points. They’d display annoyance, hate, and bitterness.
Or they’d sit silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say, like Sarabha.
Wanderers, someone might say to me: ‘Your teaching does not 10.1
lead someone who practices it to the complete ending of suffering,
the goal for which it is taught.’ Then I’d carefully pursue, press,
and grill them on that point. When grilled by me, they would,
without a doubt, fall into one of these three categories. They’d
dodge the issue, distracting the discussion with irrelevant points.
They’d display annoyance, hate, and bitterness. Or they’d sit silent,
dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing
to say, like Sarabha.”
Then the Buddha, having roared his lion’s roar three times in the 10.4
wanderers’ monastery on the bank of the Sappinī river, rose into
the air and flew away.
Soon after the Buddha left, those wanderers beset Sarabha on 11.1
all sides with sneering and jeering. “Reverend Sarabha, you’re just
like an old jackal in the formidable wilderness who thinks, ‘I’ll roar
a lion’s roar!’ but they still only manage to squeal and yelp like a
jackal. In the same way, when the ascetic Gotama wasn’t here you
said ‘I’ll roar a lion’s roar!’ but you only managed to squeal and
yelp like a jackal.
You’re just like a marsh hen who thinks, ‘I’ll cry like a cuckoo!’ 11.4
but they still only manage to cry like a marsh hen. In the same
way, when the ascetic Gotama wasn’t here you said ‘I’ll cry like a
cuckoo!’ but you still only managed to cry like a marsh hen.
You’re justlikeabullthatthinkstobellowonlywhenthecowstall 11.6
is empty. In the same way, you only thought to bellow when the
ascetic Gotama wasn t here. Thats how those wanderers beset
Sarabha on all sides with sneering and jeering.

AN 3.65
##### With the Kālāmas of Kesamutta

_Kesamuttisutta_

1.1 So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was wandering in the
land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants
when he arrived at a town of the Kālāmas named Kesamutta. The
Kālāmas of Kesamutta heard:
1.4 “It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a
Sakyan family—has arrived at Kesamutta. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha
…’ It’s good to see such perfected ones.”
2.1 Then the Kālāmas went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down
to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite
conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha,
some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.
Seated to one side the Kālāmas said to the Buddha:
3.1 “There are, sir, some ascetics and brahmins who come to Kesamutta. They explain and promote only their own doctrine, while
they attack, badmouth, disparage, and smear the doctrines of others. Then some other ascetics and brahmins come to Kesamutta.
They too explain and promote only their own doctrine, while they
attack, badmouth, disparage, and smear the doctrines of others.
So, sir, we’re doubting and uncertain: ‘I wonder who of these respected ascetics and brahmins speaks the truth, and who speaks
falsehood?’”
3.7 “It is enough, Kālāmas, for you to be doubting and uncertain.
Doubt has come up in you about an uncertain matter.
4.1 Please, Kālāmas, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t
rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned train of
thought, don t go by the acceptance of a view after deliberation,
don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’ But when you know for yourselves:
‘These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible
people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and
suffering’, then you should give them up.
What do you think, Kālāmas? Does greed come up in a person 5.1
for their welfare or harm?”
“Harm, sir.” 6.1
“A greedy individual, overcome by greed, kills living creatures, 7.1
steals,commitsadultery,lies,andencouragesotherstodothesame.
Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”
“Yes, sir.” 8.1
“What do you think, Kālāmas? Does hate come up in a person 9.1
for their welfare or harm?”
“Harm, sir.” 10.1
“A hateful individual, overcome by hate, kills living creatures, 11.1
steals,commitsadultery,lies,andencouragesotherstodothesame.
Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”
“Yes, sir.” 12.1
“What do you think, Kālāmas? Does delusion come up in a 13.1
person for their welfare or harm?”
“Harm, sir.” 14.1
“A deluded individual, overcome by delusion, kills living crea- 15.1
tures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do
the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”
“Yes, sir.” 16.1
“What do you think, Kālāmas, are these things skillful or un- 17.1
skillful?”
“Unskillful, sir.” 18.1
“Blameworthy or blameless?” 19.1
“Blameworthy, sir.” 20.1
“Criticized or praised by sensible people?” 21.1
“Criticized by sensible people, sir.” 22.1
23.1 When you undertake them, do they lead to harm and suffering,
or not? Or how do you see this?”
24.1 “When you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering.
That’s how we see it.”
25.1 “So, Kālāmas, whenIsaid: ‘Please, don’tgobyoraltransmission,
don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical
authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by
reasoned train of thought, don’t go by the acceptance of a view
after deliberation, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and
don’t think “The ascetic is our respected teacher.” But when you
know for yourselves: “These things are unskillful, blameworthy,
criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they
lead to harm and suffering”, then you should give them up.’ That’s
what I said, and this is why I said it.
26.1 Please, Kālāmas, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t
rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned train of
thought, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after deliberation,
don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’ But when you know for yourselves:
‘These things are skillful, blameless, praised by sensible people, and
when you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness’,
then you should acquire them and keep them.
27.1 What do you think, Kālāmas? Does contentment come up in a
person for their welfare or harm?”
28.1 “Welfare, sir.”
29.1 “An individual who is content, not overcome by greed, doesn’t
kill living creatures, steal, commit adultery, lie, or encourage others
to do the same. Is that for their lasting welfare and happiness?”
30.1 “Yes, sir.”
31.1 “What do you think, Kālāmas? Does love come up in a person
for their welfare or harm? … Does understanding come up in a
person for their welfare or harm? … Is that for their lasting welfare
and happiness?”
32.1 “Yes, sir.”
What do you think, Kālāmas, are these things skillful or un 33.1
skillful?”
“Skillful, sir.” 34.1
“Blameworthy or blameless?” 35.1
“Blameless, sir.” 36.1
“Criticized or praised by sensible people?” 37.1
“Praised by sensible people, sir.” 38.1
“When you undertake them, do they lead to welfare and happi- 39.1
ness, or not? Or how do you see this?”
“When you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness. 40.1
That’s how we see it.”
“So, Kālāmas, whenIsaid: ‘Please, don’tgobyoraltransmission, 41.1
don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical
authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by
reasoned train of thought, don’t go by the acceptance of a view
after deliberation, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and
don’t think “The ascetic is our respected teacher.” But when you
know for yourselves:
“These things are skillful, blameless, praised by sensible people, 41.5
and when you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness”,
then you should acquire them and keep them.’ That’s what I said,
and this is why I said it.
Then that noble disciple is rid of desire, rid of ill will, uncon- 42.1
fused, aware, and mindful. They meditate spreading a heart full
of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and
to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere,
all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—
abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion to one di- 42.2
rection, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In
the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they

42.4 They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In
the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they
spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant,
expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
43.1 When that noble disciple has a mind that’s free of enmity and
ill will, uncorrupted and purified, they’ve won four consolations
in this very life. ‘If it turns out there is another world, and good
and bad deeds have a result, then—when the body breaks up, after
death—I’ll be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ This is the
first consolation they’ve won.
44.1 ‘If it turns out there is no other world, and good and bad deeds
don’t have a result, then in this very life I’ll keep myself free of
enmity and ill will, untroubled and happy.’ This is the second consolation they’ve won.
45.1 ‘If it turns out that bad things happen to people who do bad
things, then since I have no bad intentions, and since I’m not doing anything bad, how can suffering touch me?’ This is the third
consolation they’ve won.
46.1 ‘If it turns out that bad things don’t happen to people who do
bad things, then I still see myself pure on both sides.’ This is the
fourth consolation they’ve won.
47.1 When that noble disciple has a mind that’s free of enmity and ill
will, undefiled and purified, they’ve won these four consolations
in this very life.”
48.1 “That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! When
that noble disciple has a mind that’s free of enmity and ill will,
undefiled and purified, they’ve won these four consolations in this
very life. …
53.1 Excellent, sir! Excellent! … We go for refuge to the Buddha, to
the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth,
may the Buddha remember us as lay followers who have gone for
refuge for life.”

##### With Sāḷha and His Friend

_Sāḷhasutta_

So I have heard. Now at that time Venerable Nandaka was 1.1
stayingnearSāvatthīinthestiltlonghouseofMigāra’smotherinthe
Eastern Monastery. Then Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson, and Rohaṇa,
Pekhuṇiya’s grandson went up to Venerable Nandaka, bowed, and
sat down to one side. Then Venerable Nandaka said to Sāḷha:
“Please, Sāḷha and friend, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go 2.1
by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority,
don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned

think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’ But when you know for
yourselves: ‘These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by
sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm
and suffering’, then you should give them up.
What do you think, Sāḷha? Is greed real?” 3.1
“Yes, sir.” 4.1
“‘Covetousness’ is what I mean by this. A person who is greedy 5.1
and covetous kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies,

“Yes, sir.” 6.1
“What do you think, Sāḷha? Is hate real?” 7.1
“Yes, sir.” 8.1
“‘Malice’ is what I mean by this. A hateful and malicious person 9.1

“Yes, sir.” 10.1
11.1 What do you think, Sāḷha? Is delusion real?
12.1 “Yes, sir.”
13.1 “‘Ignorance’ is what I mean by this. A person who is deluded

know for yourselves: “These things are unskillful, blameworthy,
criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they
lead to harm and suffering”, then you should give them up.’ That’s
what I said, and this is why I said it.
24.1 Please, Sāḷha and friend, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go
by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority,
don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned
train of thought, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after deliberation, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think
‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’ But when you know for yourselves: ‘These things are skillful, blameless, praised by sensible
people, and when you undertake them, they lead to welfare and
happiness’, then you should acquire them and keep them.
What do you think? Is contentment real?” 25.1
“Yes, sir.” 26.1
“‘Satisfaction’ is what I mean by this. A person who is content 27.1
and satisfied doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit adultery, lie,
or encourage others to do the same. Is that for their lasting welfare
and happiness?”
“Yes, sir.” 28.1
What do you think? Is love real?” 29.1
“Yes, sir.” 30.1
“‘Kindness’ is what I mean by this. A loving and kind-hearted 31.1
person doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit adultery, lie, or
encourage others to do the same. Is that for their lasting welfare
and happiness?”
“Yes, sir.” 32.1
“What do you think, Sāḷha? Is understanding real?” 33.1
“Yes, sir.” 34.1
“‘Knowledge’ is what I mean by this. A person who understands 35.1
and knows doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit adultery, lie,
or encourage others to do the same. Is that for their lasting welfare
and happiness?”
“Yes, sir.” 36.1
“What do you think, Sāḷha, are these things skillful or unskill- 37.1
ful?”
“Skillful, sir.” 38.1
“Blameworthy or blameless?” 39.1
“Blameless, sir.” 40.1
“Criticized or praised by sensible people?” 41.1
“Praised by sensible people, sir.” 42.1
“When you undertake them, do they lead to welfare and happi- 43.1
ness, or not? Or how do you see this?”
“When you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness. 44.1
That’s how we see it.”
45.1 So, Sāḷha and friend, when I said: Please, don t go by oral
transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go
by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference,
don’t go by reasoned train of thought, don’t go by the acceptance of
aviewafterdeliberation,don’tgobytheappearanceofcompetence,
and don’t think “The ascetic is our respected teacher.” But when
you know for yourselves:
45.4 “These things are skillful, blameless, praised by sensible people,
and when you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness”,
then you should acquire them and keep them.’ That’s what I said,
and this is why I said it.
46.1 Then thatnoblediscipleisridofdesire,ridofillwill,unconfused,
aware, and mindful. They meditate spreading a heart full of love
… compassion … rejoicing … equanimity to one direction, and
to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same
way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a
heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive,
limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
46.5 They understand: ‘There is this, there is what is worse than this,
there is what is better than this, and there is an escape beyond the
scope of perception.’ Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is
freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and
ignorance. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.
46.9 They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has
been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’
47.1 They understand: ‘Formerly there was greed, which was unskillful. Now there is none, so that’s skillful. Formerly there was
hate, which was unskillful. Now there is none, so that’s skillful.
Formerly there was delusion, which was unskillful. Now there is
none, so that’s skillful.’ So they live without wishes in this very life,
quenched, cooled, experiencing bliss, with self become divine.”
AN 3.67
##### Topics of Discussion

_Kathāvatthusutta_

“There are, mendicants, these three topics of discussion. What 1.1
three? You might discuss the past: ‘That is how it was in the past.’
You might discuss the future: ‘That is how it will be in the future.’
Or you might discuss the present: ‘This is how it is at present.’
You can know whether or not a person is competent to hold a 2.1
discussion by seeing how they take part in a discussion. When a
person is asked a question, if it needs to be answered categorically
and they don’t answer it categorically; or if it needs analysis and
they answer without analyzing it; or if it needs a counter-question
and they answer without a counter-question; or if it should be set
aside and they don’t set it aside, then that person is not competent
to hold a discussion. When a person is asked a question, if it needs
to be answered categorically and they answer it categorically; or if
it needs analysis and they answer after analyzing it; or if it needs
a counter-question and they answer with a counter-question; or
if it should be set aside and they set it aside, then that person is
competent to hold a discussion.
You can know whether or not a person is competent to hold a 3.1
discussion by seeing how they take part in a discussion. When a
person is asked a question, if they’re not consistent about what
their position is and what it isn’t; about what they propose; about
speaking from what they know; and about the appropriate procedure, then that person is not competent to hold a discussion.
When a person is asked a question, if they are consistent about
what their position is and what it isn’t; about what they propose;
about speaking from what they know; and about the appropriate
procedure, then that person is competent to hold a discussion.
You can know whether or not a person is competent to hold 4.1
a discussion by seeing how they take part in a discussion. When
a person is asked a question, if they dodge the issue; distract the
discussion with irrelevant points; or display annoyance, hate, and
bitterness, then that person is not competent to hold a discussion.
When a person is asked a question, if they don’t dodge the issue;
distract the discussion with irrelevant points; or display annoyance, hate, and bitterness, then that person is competent to hold a
discussion.
5.1 You can know whether or not a person is competent to hold
a discussion by seeing how they take part in a discussion. When
a person is asked a question, if they intimidate, crush, mock, or
seize on trivial mistakes, then that person is not competent to hold
a discussion. When a person is asked a question, if they don’t
intimidate, crush, mock, or seize on trivial mistakes, then that
person is competent to hold a discussion.
6.1 You can know whether or not a person has what’s required by
seeing how they take part in a discussion. If they actively listen
they have what’s required; if they don’t actively listen they don’t
have what’s required. Someone who has what’s required directly
knows one thing, completely understands one thing, gives up one
thing, and realizes one thing—and then they experience complete
freedom. This is the purpose of discussion, consultation, the requirements, and listening well, that is, the liberation of the mind
by not grasping.

7.1 Those who converse with hostility,
too sure of themselves, arrogant,
ignoble, attacking virtues,
they look for flaws in each other.

8.1 They rejoice together when their opponent
speaks poorly and makes a mistake,
becoming confused and defeated—
but the noble ones don’t discuss like this.

9.1 If an astute person wants to hold a discussion
connected with the teaching and its meaning—
the kind of discussion that noble ones hold—
then that wise one should start the discussion,

knowing when the time is right, 10.1
neither hostile nor arrogant.
Not over-excited,
contemptuous, or aggressive,

or with a mind full of jealousy, 11.1
they’d speak from what they rightly know.
They agree with what was well spoken,
without criticizing what was poorly said.

They’d not persist in finding faults, 12.1
nor seize on trivial mistakes,
neither intimidating nor crushing the other,
nor would they speak suggestively.

Good people consult 13.1
for the sake of knowledge and clarity.
That’s how the noble ones consult,
this is a noble consultation.
Knowing this, an intelligent person
would consult without arrogance.”

##### Followers of Other Religions

_Aññatitthiyasutta_

“Mendicants, if wanderers of other religions were to ask: ‘There are 1.1
these three things. What three? Greed, hate, and delusion. These
are the three things. What’s the difference between them?’ How
would you answer them?”
“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and 1.8
our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning
of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”
1.9 Well then, mendicants, listen and apply your mind well, I will
speak.”
1.10 “Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:
2.1 “Mendicants, if wanderers of other religions were to ask: ‘There
are these three things. What three? Greed, hate, and delusion.
These are the three things. What’s the difference between them?’
You should answer them: ‘Greed, reverends, is mildly blameworthy, but slow to fade away. Hate is very blameworthy, but quick to
fade away. Delusion is very blameworthy, and slow to fade away.’
3.1 And if they ask: ‘What is the cause, what is the reason why
greed arises, and once arisen it increases and grows?’ You should
say: ‘The beautiful feature of things. When you apply the mind
irrationally to the beautiful feature of things, greed arises, and once
arisen it increases and grows. This is the cause, this is the reason
why greed arises, and once arisen it increases and grows.’
4.1 And if they ask: ‘What is the cause, what is the reason why hate
arises, and once arisen it increases and grows?’ You should say:
‘The feature of harshness. When you apply the mind irrationally to
the feature of harshness, hate arises, and once arisen it increases
and grows. This is the cause, this is the reason why hate arises, and
once arisen it increases and grows.’
5.1 And if they ask: ‘What is the cause, what is the reason why
delusionarises, andoncearisenitincreasesandgrows?’ Youshould
say: ‘Irrational application of mind. When you apply the mind
irrationally, delusion arises, and once arisen it increases and grows.
This is the cause, this is the reason why delusion arises, and once
arisen it increases and grows.’
6.1 And if they ask, ‘What is the cause, what is the reason why greed
doesn’t arise, or if it’s already arisen it’s given up?’ You should say:
‘The ugly feature of things. When you apply the mind rationally
on the ugly feature of things, greed doesn’t arise, or if it’s already
arisen it’s given up. This is the cause, this is the reason why greed
doesn’t arise, or if it’s already arisen it’s given up.’
7.1 And if they ask, ‘What is the cause, what is the reason why hate
doesn’t arise, or if it’s already arisen it’s given up?’ You should say:
The hearts release by love. When you apply the mind rationally
on the heart’s release by love, hate doesn’t arise, or if it’s already
arisen it’s given up. This is the cause, this is the reason why hate
doesn’t arise, or if it’s already arisen it’s given up.’
And if they ask, ‘What is the cause, what is the reason why 8.1
delusion doesn’t arise, or if it’s already arisen it’s given up?’ You
should say: ‘Rational application of mind. When you apply the
mind rationally, delusion doesn’t arise, or if it’s already arisen it’s
given up. This is the cause, this is the reason why delusion doesn’t
arise, or if it’s already arisen it’s given up.’”

AN 3.69
##### Unskillful Roots

_Akusalamūlasutta_

“Mendicants, there are these three unskillful roots. What three? 1.1
Greed, hate, and delusion.
Greed is a root of the unskillful. When a greedy person chooses 2.1
to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is unskillful. When
a greedy person, overcome by greed, causes another to suffer under a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation
or condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want
power’, that too is unskillful. And so these many bad, unskillful
things are produced in them, born, sourced, originated, and conditioned by greed.
Hate is a root of the unskillful. When a hateful person chooses 3.1
to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is unskillful. When
a hateful person, overcome by hate, causes another to suffer under a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation
or condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want
power’, that too is unskillful. And so these many bad, unskillful
things are produced in them, born, sourced, originated, and conditioned by hate.
4.1 Delusion is a root of the unskillful. When a deluded person
chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is unskillful. When a deluded person, overcome by delusion, causes another
to suffer under a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or
confiscation or condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want power’, that too is unskillful. And so these many bad,
unskillful things are produced in them, born, sourced, originated,
and conditioned by delusion. Such a person is said to have speech
that’s ill-timed, false, meaningless, not in line with the teaching and
training.
5.1 Why is this? This person causes another to suffer under a false
pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want power’.
So when someone makes a valid criticism, they’re scornful and admit nothing. When someone makes a baseless criticism, they make
noefforttoexplain, ‘Thisiswhythat’suntrue, thisiswhythat’sfalse.’
That’swhysuchapersonissaidtohavespeechthat’sill-timed, false,
meaningless, not in line with the teaching and training.
6.1 Such a person—overcome with bad, unskillful qualities born of
greed, hate, and delusion—suffers in this very life, with distress,
anguish, and fever. And when the body breaks up, after death, they
can expect to be reborn in a bad place.
7.1 Suppose a sal, axlewood, or boxwood tree was choked and engulfed by three camel’s foot creepers. It would fall to ruin and
disaster. In the same way, such a person—overcome with bad,
unskillful qualities born of greed, hate, and delusion—suffers in
this very life, with distress, anguish, and fever. And when the body
breaks up, after death, they can expect to be reborn in a bad place.
8.1 These are the three unskillful roots.
9.1 There are these three skillful roots. What three? Contentment,
love, and understanding.
10.1 Contentment is a root of the skillful. When a contented person
chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is skillful.
When a contented person, not overcome by greed, doesn’t cause
another to suffer under a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment thinking
‘I’m powerful, I want power’, that too is skillful. And so these many
skillful things are produced in them, born, sourced, originated, and
conditioned by contentment.
Love isarootoftheskillful. Whenalovingpersonchoosestoact 11.1
by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is skillful. When a loving
person,notovercomebyhate,doesn’tcauseanothertosufferunder
a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or
condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want
power’, that too is skillful. And so these many skillful things are
produced in them, born, sourced, originated, and conditioned by
love.
Understanding is a root of the skillful. When an understanding 12.1
person chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is
skillful. When an understanding person, not overcome by delusion, doesn’t cause another to suffer under a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want power’, that too is skillful.
And so these many skillful things are produced in them, born,
sourced, originated, and conditioned by understanding. Such a
person is said to have speech that’s well-timed, true, meaningful,
in line with the teaching and training.
Why is this? This person doesn’t cause another to suffer under 13.1
a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation
or condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want
power’. So when someone makes a valid criticism, they admit it
and aren’t scornful. When someone makes a baseless criticism,
they make an effort to explain, ‘This is why that’s untrue, this is
why that’s false.’ That’s why such a person is said to have speech
that’s well-timed, true, meaningful, in line with the teaching and
training.
For such a person, bad unskillful qualities born of greed, hate, 14.1
and delusion are cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. In this very life they’re
happy, free of distress, anguish, and fever, and they re also extin
guished in this very life.
15.1 Suppose a sal, axlewood, or boxwood tree was choked and engulfed by three camel’s foot creepers. Then along comes a person
with a spade and basket. They’d cut the creeper out by the roots,
dig them up, and pull them out, down to the fibers and stems.
Then they’d split the creeper apart, cut up the parts, and chop it
into splinters. They’d dry the splinters in the wind and sun, burn
them with fire, and reduce them to ashes. Then they’d sweep away
the ashes in a strong wind, or float them away down a swift stream.
So those camel’s foot creepers would be cut off at the root, made
like a palm stump, and obliterated, unable to arise in the future. In
the same way, for such a person, bad unskillful qualities born of
greed, hate, and delusion are cut off at the root, made like a palm
stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. In this very
life they’re happy, free of distress, anguish, and fever, and they’re
also extinguished in this very life.
16.1 These are the three skillful roots.”

AN 3.70
##### Sabbath

_Uposathasutta_

1.1 So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern
Monastery.
1.3 Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, went up to the Buddha, bowed,
and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to her, “So, Visākhā,
where are you coming from in the middle of the day?”
1.5 “Today, sir, I’m observing the sabbath.”
2.1 “There are, Visākhā, these three sabbaths. What three? The
sabbath of the cowherds, the sabbath of the Jains, and the sabbath
of the noble ones.
And what is the sabbath of the cowherds? Its just like a cowherd 2.4
who, in the late afternoon, takes the cows back to their owners.
They reflect: ‘Today the cows grazed in this spot and that, and
they drank in this spot and that. Tomorrow the cows will graze
in this spot and that, and drink in this spot and that.’ In the same
way, someone keeping the sabbath reflects: ‘Today I ate this and
that, and had a meal of this and that. Tomorrow I’ll eat this and
that, and have a meal of this and that.’ And so they spend their
day with a mind full of covetousness. That’s the sabbath of the
cowherds. When the cowherd’s sabbath is observed like this it’s
not very fruitful or beneficial or splendid or bountiful.
And what is the sabbath of the Jains? There’s a kind of ascetic be- 3.1
longing to a group called the Jains. They encourage their disciples:
‘Please, good people, don’t hurt any living creatures more than a
hundred leagues away to the east. Don’t hurt any living creatures
more than a hundred leagues away to the west. Don’t hurt any
living creatures more than a hundred leagues away to the north.
Don’t hurt any living creatures more than a hundred leagues away
to the south.’ So they encourage kindness and sympathy for some
creatures and not others. On the sabbath, they encourage their
disciples: ‘Please, good people, take off all your clothes and say:
“I don’t belong to anyone anywhere! And nothing belongs to me
anywhere!”’ But their mother and father still know, ‘This is our
child.’ And they know, ‘This is my mother and father.’ Partner and
child still know, ‘This is our supporter.’ And they know, ‘This is
my partner and child.’ Bondservants, workers, and staff still know:
‘This is our master.’ And they know, ‘These are my bondservants,
workers, and staff.’ So, at a time when they should be encouraged
to speak the truth, the Jains encourage them to lie. This, I say, is
lying. When the night has passed they use their possessions once
more, though they’ve not been given back to them. This, I say, is
stealing. That’s the sabbath of the Jains. When the Jain’s sabbath is
observed like this it’s not very fruitful or beneficial or splendid or
bountiful.
4.1 And what is the sabbath of the noble ones? A corrupt mind is
cleaned by applying effort. And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by
applying effort? It’s when a noble disciple recollects the Realized
One: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world,
supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and
humans, awakened, blessed.’ As they recollect the Realized One,
their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are
given up. It’s just like cleaning a dirty head by applying effort.
5.1 And how is a dirty head cleaned by applying effort? With cleansing paste, clay, and water, and by applying the appropriate effort.
In the same way, a corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort.
6.1 And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort? It’s when
a noble disciple recollects the Realized One: ‘That Blessed One is
perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge
and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those
who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
As they recollect the Realized One, their mind becomes clear, joy
arises, and mental corruptions are given up. This is called: ‘A noble
disciple who observes the sabbath of the divinity, living together
with the divinity. And because they think of the divinity their
mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given
up.’ That’s how a corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort.
7.1 A corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort. And how is a
corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort? It’s when a noble disciple recollects the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by
the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective,
inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it
for themselves.’ As they recollect the teaching, their mind becomes
clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up. It’s just like
cleaning a dirty body by applying effort.
8.1 And how is a dirty body cleaned by applying effort? With
cleanser and powder, water, and by applying the appropriate effort.
That’s how a dirty body is cleaned by applying effort. In the same
way, a corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort.
And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort? Its 9.1
when a noble disciple recollects the teaching: ‘The teaching is
well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible
people can know it for themselves.’ As they recollect the teaching, their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions
are given up. This is called: ‘A noble disciple who observes the
sabbath of Dhamma, living together with Dhamma. And because
they think of the Dhamma their mind becomes clear, joy arises,
and mental corruptions are given up.’ That’s how a corrupt mind is
cleaned by applying effort.
A corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort. And how is a 10.1
corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort? It’s when a noble disciple
recollects the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is
practicing the way that’s good, sincere, systematic, and proper. It
consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha
oftheBuddha’sdisciplesthatisworthyofofferingsdedicatedtothe
gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy
of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit
for the world.’ As they recollect the Saṅgha, their mind becomes
clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up. It’s just like
cleaning a dirty cloth by applying effort.
And how is a dirty cloth cleaned by applying effort? With salt, 11.1
lye, cow dung, and water, and by applying the appropriate effort.
That’s how a dirty cloth is cleaned by applying effort. In the same
way, a corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort.
And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort? It’s when 12.1
a noble disciple recollects the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s
disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and
proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This
Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is worthy of offerings dedicated
to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation,
and worthy of veneration with joined palms. It is the supreme field
of merit for the world.’ As they recollect the Saṅgha, their mind
becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up.
This is called: A noble disciple who observes the sabbath of the
Saṅgha, living together with the Saṅgha. And because they think
of the Saṅgha their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental
corruptions are given up.’ That’s how a corrupt mind is cleaned by
applying effort.
13.1 A corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort. And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort? It’s when a noble disciple
recollects their own ethical conduct, which is intact, impeccable,
spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not
mistaken, and leading to immersion. As they recollect their ethical
conduct, their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up. It’s just like cleaning a dirty mirror by applying
effort.
14.1 And how is a dirty mirror cleaned by applying effort? With oil,
ash, a rolled-up cloth, andbyapplyingthe appropriateeffort. That’s
how a dirty mirror is cleaned by applying effort. In the same way, a
corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort.
15.1 And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort? It’s when
a noble disciple recollects their own ethical conduct, which is intact, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by
sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. As they
recollect their ethical conduct, their mind becomes clear, joy arises,
and mental corruptions are given up. This is called: ‘A noble disciple who observes the sabbath of ethical conduct, living together
with ethics. And because they think of their ethical conduct their
mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given
up.’ That’s how a corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort.
16.1 A corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort. And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort? It’s when a noble disciple
recollects the deities: ‘There are the gods of the four great kings,
the gods of the thirty-three, the gods of Yama, the joyful gods, the
gods who love to imagine, the gods who control what is imagined
by others, the gods of the Divinity’s host, and gods even higher
than these. When those deities passed away from here, they were
reborn there because of their faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and
wisdom. I, too, have the same kind of faith, ethics, learning, gen
erosity, and wisdom.’ As they recollect the faith, ethics, learning,
generosity, and wisdom of both themselves and those deities, their
mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given
up. It’s just like cleansing corrupt native gold by applying effort.
And how is corrupt native gold cleansed by applying effort? 17.1
With a furnace, flux, a blowpipe, and tongs, and by applying the
appropriate effort. That’s how corrupt native gold is cleansed by
applying effort. In the same way, a corrupt mind is cleaned by
applying effort.
And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort? It’s when 18.1
a noble disciple recollects the deities: ‘There are the gods of the
four great kings, the gods of the thirty-three, the gods of Yama,
the joyful gods, the gods who love to imagine, the gods who control what is imagined by others, the gods of the Divinity’s host,
and gods even higher than these. When those deities passed away
from here, they were reborn there because of their faith, ethics,
learning, generosity, and wisdom. I, too, have the same kind of
faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.’ As they recollect
the faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom of both themselves and those deities, their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and
mental corruptions are given up. This is called: ‘A noble disciple
who observes the sabbath of the deities, living together with the
deities. And because they think of the deities their mind becomes
clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up.’ That’s how a
corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort.
Then that noble disciple reflects: ‘As long as they live, the per- 19.1
fected ones give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and
the sword. They are scrupulous and kind, and live full of sympathy for all living beings. I, too, for this day and night will give up
killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. I’ll be
scrupulous and kind, and live full of sympathy for all living beings.
I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this
respect.
20.1 As long as they live, the perfected ones give up stealing. They
take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep
themselves clean by not thieving. I, too, for this day and night will
give up stealing. I’ll take only what’s given, and expect only what’s
given. I’ll keep myself clean by not thieving. I will observe the
sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.
21.1 As long as they live, the perfected ones give up unchastity. They
are celibate, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex. I, too, for this
day and night will give up unchastity. I will be celibate, set apart,
avoiding the vulgar act of sex. I will observe the sabbath by doing
as the perfected ones do in this respect.
22.1 As long as they live, the perfected ones give up lying. They speak
the truth and stick to the truth. They’re honest and trustworthy,
and don’t trick the world with their words. I, too, for this day and
night will give up lying. I’ll speak the truth and stick to the truth.
I’ll be honest and dependable, and won’t trick the world with my
words. I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones
do in this respect.
23.1 As long as they live, the perfected ones give up beer, wine, and
liquor intoxicants. I, too, for this day and night will give up beer,
wine, and liquor intoxicants. I will observe the sabbath by doing
as the perfected ones do in this respect.
24.1 As long as they live, the perfected ones eat in one part of the day,
abstaining from eating at night and from food at the wrong time. I,
too, for this day and night will eat in one part of the day, abstaining
from eating at night and food at the wrong time. I will observe the
sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.
25.1 As longastheylive, theperfectedonesrefrainfromseeingshows
ofdancing,singing,andmusic; andbeautifyingandadorningthemselves with garlands, fragrance, and makeup. I, too, for this day and
night will refrain from seeing shows of dancing, singing, and music
; and beautifying and adorning myself with garlands, fragrance,
and makeup. I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected
ones do in this respect.
As long as they live, the perfected ones give up high and luxuri 26.1
ous beds. They sleep in a low place, either a cot or a straw mat. I,
too, for this day and night will give up high and luxurious beds. I’ll
sleep in a low place, either a cot or a straw mat. I will observe the
sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.’
That’s the sabbath of the noble ones. When the sabbath of the 27.1
noble ones is observed like this it’s very fruitful and beneficial and
splendid and bountiful.
How much so? Suppose you were to rule as sovereign lord over 28.1
these sixteen great countries—Aṅga, Magadha, Kāsi, Kosala, Vajji,
Malla, Cetī, Vaccha, Kuru, Pañcāla, Maccha, Sūrasena, Assaka,
Avanti, Gandhāra, and Kamboja—full of the seven treasures. This
wouldn’t be worth a sixteenth part of the sabbath with its eight
factors. Why is that? Because human kingship is a poor thing
compared to the happiness of the gods.
Fifty years in the human realm is one day and night for the gods 29.1
of the four great kings. Thirty such days make up a month. Twelve
such months make up a year. The lifespan of the gods of the four
great kings is five hundred of these heavenly years. It’s possible
that some woman or man who has observed the eight-factored
sabbath will—when their body breaks up, after death—be reborn
in the company of the gods of the four great kings. This is what
I was referring to when I said: ‘Human kingship is a poor thing
compared to the happiness of the gods.’
A hundred years in the human realm is one day and night for 30.1
the gods of the thirty-three. Thirty such days make up a month.
Twelve such months make up a year. The lifespan of the gods of the
thirty-three is a thousand of these heavenly years. It’s possible that
some woman or man who has observed the eight-factored sabbath
will—when their body breaks up, after death—be reborn in the
company of the gods of the thirty-three. This is what I was referring
to when I said: ‘Human kingship is a poor thing compared to the
happiness of the gods.’
Two hundred years in the human realm is one day and night for 31.1
the gods of Yama. Thirty such days make up a month. Twelve such
months make up a year. The lifespan of the gods of Yama is two
thousand of these heavenly years. It’s possible that some woman
or man who has observed the eight-factored sabbath will—when
their body breaks up, after death—be reborn in the company of the
gods of Yama. This is what I was referring to when I said: ‘Human
kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.’
32.1 Four hundred years in the human realm is one day and night
for the joyful gods. Thirty such days make up a month. Twelve
such months make up a year. The lifespan of the joyful gods is four
thousand of these heavenly years. It’s possible that some woman
or man who has observed the eight-factored sabbath will—when
their body breaks up, after death—be reborn in the company of
the joyful gods. This is what I was referring to when I said: ‘Human
kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.’
33.1 Eight hundred years in the human realm is one day and night
for the gods who love to imagine. Thirty such days make up a
month. Twelve such months make up a year. The lifespan of the
gods who love to imagine is eight thousand of these heavenly years.
It’s possible that some woman or man who has observed the eightfactored sabbath will—when their body breaks up, after death—
be reborn in the company of the gods who love to imagine. This
is what I was referring to when I said: ‘Human kingship is a poor
thing compared to the happiness of the gods.’
34.1 Sixteen hundred years in the human realm is one day and night
for the gods who control what is imagined by others. Thirty such
days make up a month. Twelve such months make up a year. The
lifespan of the gods who control what is imagined by others is
sixteen thousand of these heavenly years. It’s possible that some
womanormanwhohasobservedtheeight-factoredsabbathwill—
when their body breaks up, after death—be reborn in the company
of the gods who control what is imagined by others. This is what
I was referring to when I said: ‘Human kingship is a poor thing
compared to the happiness of the gods.’

35.1 You shouldn’t kill living creatures, or steal,
or lie, or drink liquor.
Be celibate, refraining from sex,
and don’t eat at night, the wrong time.

Not wearing garlands or applying fragrance, 36.1
you should sleep on a low bed,
or a mat on the ground.
This is the eight-factored sabbath, they say,
explained by the Buddha,
who has gone to suffering’s end.

The moon and sun are both fair to see, 37.1
radiating as far as they revolve.
Those dispellers of darkness, travellers in midair,
shine in the firmament, lighting up the quarters.

All of the wealth that’s found in this realm— 38.1
pearls, gems, fine beryl too,
mountain gold or lustrous gold,
or the native gold called ‘coruscant’—

they’re not worth a sixteenth part 39.1
of the sabbath with its eight factors,
as starlight cannot rival the moon.

So an ethical woman or man, 40.1
who has observed the eight-factored sabbath,
having made merit whose outcome is happiness,
blameless, they go to a heavenly place.”
# The Chapter with Ānanda

AN 3.71
##### With Channa

_Channasutta_

1.1 At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove,
Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then the wanderer Channa went up
to Venerable Ānanda and exchanged greetings with him. When
the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to
one side and said to Ānanda:
1.4 “Reverend Ānanda, do you advocate giving up greed, hate, and
delusion?”
1.5 “We do, reverend.”
2.1 “But what drawbacks have you seen, Reverend Ānanda, that you
advocate giving up greed, hate, and delusion?”
3.1 “A greedy person, overcome by greed, intends to hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both. They experience mental pain
and sadness. When greed has been given up, they don’t intend to
hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both. They don’t experience
mental pain and sadness. A greedy person does bad things by way
of body, speech, and mind. When greed has been given up, they
don’t do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. A greedy
person doesn’t truly understand what’s for their own good, the
good of another, or the good of both. When greed has been given
up, they truly understand what’s for their own good, the good of
another, or the good of both. Greed is a destroyer of sight, vision,
and knowledge. It blocks wisdom, its on the side of distress, and it
doesn’t lead to extinguishment.
A hateful person, overcome by hate, intends to hurt themselves, 4.1
hurt others, and hurt both. …
A deluded person, overcome by delusion, intends to hurt them- 4.2
selves, hurt others, and hurt both. They experience mental pain
and sadness. When delusion has been given up, they don’t intend
to hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both. They don’t experience mental pain and sadness. A deluded person does bad things
by way of body, speech, and mind. When delusion has been given
up, they don’t do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.
A deluded person doesn’t truly understand what’s for their own
good, the good of another, or the good of both. When delusion has
been given up, they truly understand what’s for their own good,
the good of another, or the good of both. Delusion is a destroyer
of sight, vision, and knowledge; it blocks wisdom, it’s on the side
of distress, and it doesn’t lead to extinguishment.
This is the drawback we’ve seen in greed, hate, and delusion, and 4.9
this is why we advocate giving them up.”
“But, reverend, is there a path and a practice for giving up that 5.1
greed, hate, and delusion?”
“There is, reverend, apathandapracticeforgivingupthatgreed, 5.2
hate, and delusion.”
“Well, what is it?” 5.3
“It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right 5.4
thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort,
right mindfulness, and right immersion. This is the path, this is the
practice for giving up that greed, hate, and delusion.”
“This is a fine path, a fine practice, for giving up that greed, hate, 5.7
and delusion. Just this much is enough to be diligent.”
AN 3.72
##### A Disciple of the Ājīvakas

_Ājīvakasutta_

1.1 At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Kosambī, in
Ghosita’s Monastery. Then a householder who was a disciple of the
Ājīvaka ascetics went up to Venerable Ānanda, bowed, sat down to
one side, and said to Ānanda:
2.1 “Honorable Ānanda, whose teaching is well explained? Who in
the world is practicing well? Who in the world has done well?”
2.4 “Well then, householder, I’ll ask you about this in return, and
youcananswerasyoulike. Whatdoyouthink, householder? Isthe
teaching of those who teach for giving up greed, hate, and delusion
well explained or not? Or how do you see this?”
2.8 “The teaching of those who teach for giving up greed, hate, and
delusion is well explained. That’s how I see it.”
3.1 “What do you think, householder? Are those who practice for
giving up greed, hate, and delusion practicing well or not? Or how
do you see this?”
3.4 “Those who practice for giving up greed, hate, and delusion are
practicing well. That’s how I see it.”
4.1 “What do you think, householder? Have those who’ve given up
greed, hate, and delusion—so they’re cut off at the root, made like
a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future—done
well in the world, or not? Or how do you see this?”
4.4 “Those who’ve given up greed, hate, and delusion have done
well in the world. That’s how I see it.”
5.1 “So, householder, you’ve declared: ‘The teaching of those who
teach for giving up greed, hate, and delusion is well explained.’ And
you’ve declared: ‘Those who practice for giving up greed, hate, and
delusion are practicing well.’ And you’ve declared: ‘Those who’ve
given up greed, hate, and delusion have done well in the world.’”
6.1 “It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! There’s no acclaiming your
own teaching or disrespecting someone else’s, just teaching what’s
relevant in that context. The goal is spoken of, but the self is not
involved. You, sir, teach Dhamma for giving up greed, hate, and
delusion. Your teaching is well explained. You, sir, practice for
giving up greed, hate, and delusion. You in the world are practicing
well. You’ve given up greed, hate, and delusion. You in the world
have done well.
Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, 7.1
or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or
lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s
there, Master Ānanda has made the teaching clear in many ways. I
go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant
Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Master Ānanda remember me as
a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

AN 3.73
##### With Mahānāma the Sakyan

_Mahānāmasakkasutta_

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in the land 1.1
of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.
NowatthattimetheBuddhahadrecentlyrecoveredfromanillness.
Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat
down to one side, and said to him:
“For a long time, sir, I have understood your teaching like this: 1.5
‘Knowledge is for those with immersion, not those without immersion.’ But, sir, does immersion come first, then knowledge? Or
does knowledge come first, then immersion?”
Then Venerable Ānanda thought, “The Buddha has recently 1.9
recovered from an illness, and this Mahānāma asks him a question
that’s too deep. Why don’t I take him off to one side and teach him
the Dhamma?”
Then Ānanda took Mahānāma by the arm, led him off to one 2.1
side, and said to him, “Mahānāma, the Buddha has spoken of the
ethics, immersion, and wisdom of a trainee; and the ethics, immersion, and wisdom of an adept. What is the ethics of a trainee? Its
when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places.
Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve
undertaken. This is called the ethics of a trainee.
3.1 And what is the immersion of a trainee? It’s when a mendicant,
quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful
qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second
absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. This is called
the immersion of a trainee.
4.1 And what is the wisdom of a trainee? They truly understand:
‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the
cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the
cessation of suffering’. This is called the wisdom of a trainee.
5.1 Then a noble disciple—accomplished in ethics, immersion, and
wisdom—realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by
wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their
own insight due to the ending of defilements.
5.2 In this way the Buddha has spoken of the ethics, immersion,
and wisdom of both a trainee and an adept.”

AN 3.74
##### Jains

_Nigaṇṭhasutta_

1.1 At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Vesālī, at the Great
Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then the Licchavis Abhaya
andPaṇḍitakumārawentuptoVenerableĀnanda,bowed,satdown
to one side, and said to him:
1.3 “Sir, the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan claims to be all-knowing
andall-seeing, toknowandseeeverythingwithoutexception,thus:
‘Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to
me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.’ He advocates
the elimination of past deeds by fervent mortification, and breaking the bridge by not doing any new deeds. So with the ending of
deeds, suffering ends; with the ending of suffering, feeling ends;
and with the ending of feeling, all suffering will have been worn
away. This is how to go beyond suffering by means of this purification by wearing away in the present life. What, sir, does the Buddha
say about this?”
“Abhaya, these three kinds of purification by wearing away have 2.1
been rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees,
the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. They are in order
to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make
an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize
extinguishment. What three?
It’s when, Abhaya, a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the 2.3
monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms
in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep
the rules they’ve undertaken. They don’t perform any new deeds,
and old deeds are eliminated by experiencing their results little by
little. This wearing away is apparent in the present life, immediately
effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can
know it for themselves.
Then a mendicant accomplished in ethics, quite secluded from 3.1
sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and
remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. They don’t perform any new deeds,
and old deeds are eliminated by experiencing their results little by
little. This wearing away is apparent in the present life, immediately
effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can
know it for themselves.
Then a mendicant accomplished in immersion realizes the un- 4.1
defiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life.
And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the
ending of defilements. They don’t perform any new deeds, and old
deeds are eliminated by experiencing their results little by little.
This wearing away is apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can
know it for themselves.
4.4 These are the three kinds of purification by wearing away that
have been rightly explained by the Buddha … in order to realize
extinguishment.”
5.1 When he said this, Paṇḍitakumāra said to Abhaya, “Dear Abhaya, is there anything in what Ānanda has said so well that you
would disagree with?”
5.3 “How could I not agree with what was said so well by Ānanda?
If anyone didn’t agree with him, their head would explode!”

AN 3.75
##### Support

_Nivesakasutta_

1.1 Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat
down to one side. The Buddha said to him:
2.1 “Ānanda, those who you have sympathy for, and those worth
listening to—friends and colleagues, relatives and family—should
be encouraged, supported, and established in three things. What
three?
2.3 Experiential confidence in the Buddha: ‘That Blessed One is
perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge
and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those
who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
2.5 Experiential confidence in the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately
effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can
know it for themselves.’
2.7 Experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, sincere, systematic,
and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This
is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings
dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious
donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme
field of merit for the world.’
There mightbe change in the four principal states—earth, water, 3.1
air, and fire—but a noble disciple with experiential confidence in
the Buddha would never change. In this context, ‘change’ means
that such a noble disciple will be reborn in hell, the animal realm,
or the ghost realm: this is quite impossible.
There mightbe change in the four principal states—earth, water, 4.1

Those who you have sympathy for, and those worth listening 5.1
to—friends and colleagues, relatives and family—should be encouraged, supported, and established in these three things.”

AN 3.76
##### Continued Existence (1st)

_Paṭhamabhavasutta_

Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down 1.1
to one side, and said to him:
“Sir, they speak of this thing called ‘continued existence’. How is 1.2
continued existence defined?”
“If, Ānanda, there were no deeds to result in the sensual realm, 2.1
would continued existence in the sensual realm still come about?”
“No, sir.” 2.2
“So, Ānanda, deeds are the field, consciousness is the seed, and 2.3
craving is the moisture. The consciousness of sentient beings—
shrouded by ignorance and fettered by craving—is established in a
lowerrealm. That’showthereisrebirthintoanewstateofexistence
in the future.
3.1 If there were no deeds to result in the realm of luminous form,
wouldcontinuedexistenceintherealmofluminousformstillcome
about?”
3.2 “No, sir.”
3.3 “So, Ānanda, deeds are the field, consciousness is the seed, and
craving is the moisture. The consciousness of sentient beings—
shrouded by ignorance and fettered by craving—is established
in a middle realm. That’s how there is rebirth into a new state of
existence in the future.
4.1 If there were no deeds to result in the formless realm, would
continued existence in the formless realm still come about?”
4.2 “No, sir.”
4.3 “So, Ānanda, deeds are the field, consciousness is the seed, and
craving is the moisture. The consciousness of sentient beings—
shrouded by ignorance and fettered by craving—is established
in a higher realm. That’s how there is rebirth into a new state of
existence in the future. That’s how continued existence is defined.”

AN 3.77
##### Continued Existence (2nd)

_Dutiyabhavasutta_

1.1 Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down
to one side, and said to him:
1.2 “Sir, they speak of this thing called ‘continued existence’. How is
continued existence defined?”
2.1 “If, Ānanda, there were no deeds to result in the sensual realm,
would continued existence in the sensual realm still come about?”
2.2 “No, sir.”
2.3 “So, Ānanda, deeds are the field, consciousness is the seed, and
craving is the moisture. The intention and aim of sentient beings—
shrouded by ignorance and fettered by craving—is established in a
lowerrealm. That’showthereisrebirthintoanewstateofexistence
in the future.
If there were no deeds to result in the realm of luminous form, 3.1
wouldcontinuedexistenceintherealmofluminousformstillcome

“No, sir.” 3.2
“So, Ānanda, deeds are the field, consciousness is the seed, and 3.3
craving is the moisture. The intention and aim of sentient beings—
shrouded by ignorance and fettered by craving—is established in
a middle realm. That’s how there is rebirth into a new state of
existence in the future.
If there were no deeds to result in the formless realm, would 4.1
continued existence in the formless realm still come about?”
“No, sir.” 4.2
“So, deeds are the field, consciousness is the seed, and craving is 4.3
the moisture. The intention and aim of sentient beings—shrouded
by ignorance and fettered by craving—is established in a higher
realm. That’s how there is rebirth into a new state of existence in
the future. That’s how continued existence is defined.”

AN 3.78
##### Precepts and Observances

_Sīlabbatasutta_

Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat 1.1
down to one side. The Buddha said to him: “Ānanda, are all precepts and observances, lifestyles, and spiritual paths fruitful when
taken as the essence?”
“This matter is not categorical, sir.” 1.3
“Well then, Ānanda, break it down.” 1.4
“Take the case of someone who cultivates precepts and obser- 2.1
vances, a lifestyle, and a spiritual path, taking this as the essence.
If unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline, that’s
not fruitful. However, if unskillful qualities decline while skillful
qualities grow, that is fruitful.”
That’s what Ānanda said, and the teacher approved. 2.3
3.1 Then Ānanda, knowing that the teacher approved, got up from
his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him
on his right, before leaving. Then, not long after Ānanda had left,
the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, Ānanda is a
trainee, but it’s not easy to find his equal in wisdom.”

AN 3.79
##### Fragrances

_Gandhajātasutta_

1.1 Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down
to one side, and said to him:
2.1 “Sir, there are these three kinds of fragrance that spread only
with the wind, not against it. What three? The fragrance of roots,
heartwood, and flowers. These are the three kinds of fragrance that
spreadonlywiththewind, notagainstit. Isthereakindoffragrance
that spreads with the wind, and against it, and both ways?”
3.1 “There is, Ānanda, such a kind of fragrance.”
3.2 “So what, sir, is that kind of fragrance?”
4.1 “It’s when, Ānanda, in some village or town, a woman or man
has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.
They don’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct,
lie, or consume beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants. They’re ethical, of good character. They live at home with a heart rid of the
stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go,
committed to charity, loving to give and to share.
5.1 Ascetics and brahmins everywhere praise them for these good
qualities; even the deities praise them. This is the kind of fragrance
that spreads with the wind, and against it, and both.

7.1 The fragrance of flowers
doesn’t spread against the wind,
nor sandalwood, pinwheel flowers, or jasmine;
but the fragrance of the good
spreads against the wind;
a true persons virtue spreads in every direction.

AN 3.80
##### Lesser

_Cūḷanikāsutta_

Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down 1.1
to one side, and said to him:
“Sir, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Bud- 1.2
dha: ‘Ānanda, the Buddha Sikhī had a disciple called Abhibhū.
Standing in the realm of divinity, he could make his voice heard
throughout the thousandfold galaxy.’ I wonder how far a Blessed
One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha can make their
voice heard?”
“He was a disciple, Ānanda. Realized Ones are immeasurable.” 1.5
For a second time … 2.1
For a third time, Ānanda said to the Buddha: “… I wonder how 3.1
far a Blessed One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha can
make their voice heard?”
“Ānanda, have you heard of a thousandfold lesser world system, 3.5
a galaxy?”
“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! Let 3.6
the Buddha speak. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”
“Well then, Ānanda, listen and apply your mind well, I will 3.8
speak.”
“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. The Buddha said this: 3.9
“Ānanda, a galaxy extends a thousand times as far as the moon 4.1
and sun revolve and the shining ones light up the quarters. In that
galaxy there are a thousand moons, a thousand suns, a thousand
Sinerus king of mountains, a thousand Black Plum Tree Lands, a
thousand Western Continents, a thousand Northern Continents,
a thousand Eastern Continents, four thousand oceans, four thousand great kings, a thousand realms of the gods of the four great
kings, a thousand realms of the gods of the thirty-three, of the gods
of Yama, of the joyful gods, of the gods who love to imagine, of
the gods who control what is imagined by others, and a thousand
realmsofdivinity. Thisiscalledathousandfoldlesserworldsystem,
a ‘galaxy’.
5.1 A world system that extends for a thousand galaxies is called a
millionfold middling world system, a ‘galactic cluster’.
6.1 A world system that extends for a thousand galactic clusters is
called a billionfold great world system, a ‘galactic supercluster’.
7.1 If he wished, Ānanda, a Realized One could make his voice
heard throughout a galactic supercluster, or as far as he wants.”
8.1 “But how would the Buddha make his voice heard so far?”
8.2 “First, Ānanda, a Realized One would fill the galactic superclusterwithlight. Whensentientbeingssawthelight, theRealizedOne
would project his call so that they’d hear the sound. That’s how
a Realized One could make his voice heard throughout a galactic
supercluster, or as far as he wants.”
9.1 When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said, “I’m so fortunate, so
very fortunate, to have a teacher with such power and might!”
9.4 When he said this, Venerable Udāyī said to Venerable Ānanda,
“What is it to you, Reverend Ānanda, if your teacher has such power
and might?”
9.6 When he said this, the Buddha said to Venerable Udāyī, “Not so,
Udāyī, not so! If Ānanda were to die while still not free of greed,
he would rule as king of the gods for seven lifetimes, or as king of
the Black Plum Tree Land for seven lifetimes, because of the confidence of his heart. However, Ānanda will be fully extinguished in
this very life.”
# The Chapter on Ascetics

AN 3.81
##### Ascetics

_Samaṇasutta_

“Mendicants, there are three duties of an ascetic. What three? Un- 1.1
dertaking the training in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and
the higher wisdom. These are the three duties of an ascetic.
So you should train like this: ‘We will have keen enthusiasm for 2.1
undertaking the training in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and
the higher wisdom.’ That’s how you should train.”

AN 3.82
##### The Donkey

_Gadrabhasutta_

“Suppose, mendicants, a donkey followed behind a herd of cattle, 1.1
thinking: ‘I can moo too! I can moo too!’ But it doesn’t look like
a cow, or sound like a cow, or leave a footprint like a cow. Still it
follows behind a herd of cattle, thinking: ‘I can moo too! I can
moo too!’
In the same way, some mendicant follows behind the mendicant 2.1
Saṅgha, thinking: ‘I’m a monk too! I’m a monk too!’ But they
don’t have the same enthusiasm for undertaking the training in
the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom as the
other mendicants. Still they follow behind the mendicant Saṇgha,
thinking: ‘I’m a monk too! I’m a monk too!’
3.1 So you should train like this: ‘We will have keen enthusiasm for
undertaking the training in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and
the higher wisdom.’ That’s how you should train.”

AN 3.83
##### Fields

_Khettasutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, a farmer has three primary duties. What three? A
farmer first of all makes sure the field is well ploughed and tilled.
Next they plant seeds in season. When the time is right, they
irrigate the field and then drain it. These are the three primary
duties of a farmer.
2.1 In the same way, a mendicant has three primary duties. What
three? Undertaking the training in the higher ethics, the higher
mind, and the higher wisdom. These are the three primary duties
of a mendicant.
3.1 So you should train like this: ‘We will have keen enthusiasm for
undertaking the training in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and
the higher wisdom.’ That’s how you should train.”

AN 3.84
##### The Vajji

_Vajjiputtasutta_

1.1 At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood,
in the hall with the peaked roof. Then a certain Vajji monk went
up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
1.3 “Sir, each fortnight over a hundred and fifty training rules are
recited. I’m not able to train in them.”
1.5 “But monk, are you able to train in three trainings: the higher
ethics, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom?”
I am, sir. 1.7
“So, monk, you should train in these three trainings: the higher 1.9
ethics, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom.
As you train in these, you will give up greed, hate, and delusion. 2.1
Then you won’t do anything unskillful, or practice anything bad.”
After some time that monk trained in the higher ethics, the 3.1
higher mind, and the higher wisdom. He gave up greed, hate,
and delusion. Then he didn’t do anything unskillful, or practice
anything bad.

AN 3.85
##### A Trainee

_Sekkhasutta_

Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one 1.1
side, and said to him:
“Sir, they speak of this person called ‘a trainee’. How is a trainee 2.1
defined?”
“They train,mendicant,that’swhythey’recalled‘atrainee’. What 2.3
is their training? They train in the higher ethics, the higher mind,
and the higher wisdom. They train, that’s why they’re called ‘a
trainee’.

As a trainee trains, 3.1
following the straight road,
first they know about ending;
enlightenment follows in the same lifetime.

Then the knowledge comes 4.1
such a one, freed through enlightenment,
with the end of the fetters of continued existence:
‘My freedom is unshakable.’”
AN 3.86
##### Training (1st)

_Paṭhamasikkhāsutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, each fortnight over a hundred and fifty training rules
come up for recitation, in which gentlemen who care for their own
welfare train. These are all included in the three trainings. What
three? The training in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the
higher wisdom. These are the three trainings that include them all.
2.1 Take the case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics, but
has limited immersion and wisdom. They break some lesser and
minor training rules, but are restored. Why is that? Because I don’t
say they’re incapable of that. But they’re constant and steady in
their precepts regarding the training rules that are fundamental,
befittingthespiritualpath. Theykeeptherulesthey’veundertaken.
With the ending of three fetters they’re a stream-enterer, not liable
to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.

With the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate,
and delusion, they’re a once-returner. They come back to this
world once only, then make an end of suffering.
4.1 Take another case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics
and immersion, but has limited wisdom. They break some lesser
and minor training rules, but are restored. Why is that? Because I
don’t say they’re incapable of that. But they’re constant and steady
in their precepts regarding the training rules that are fundamental,
befitting the spiritual path. They keep the rules they’ve undertaken. With the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn
spontaneously. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to
return from that world.
Take another case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics, 5.1
immersion, and wisdom. They break some lesser and minor training rules, but are restored. Why is that? Because I don’t say they’re
incapable of that. But they’re constant and steady in their precepts
regarding the training rules that are fundamental, befitting the spiritual path. They keep the rules they’ve undertaken. They realize
the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very
life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to
the ending of defilements.
So, mendicants, if you practice partially you succeed partially. If 6.1
you practice fully you succeed fully. These training rules are not a
waste, I say.”

ending of the five lower fetters they’re extinguished upon landing. With the ending of the five lower fetters they’re extinguished

in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom.
2.1 And what is the training in the higher ethics? It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger
in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. This
is called the training in the higher ethics.
3.1 And what is the training in the higher mind? It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second
absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. This is called
the training in the higher mind.
4.1 And what is the training in the higher wisdom? They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ …
‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads
to the cessation of suffering. This is called the training in the higher

AN 3.91
##### At Paṅkadhā

_Saṅkavāsutta_

1.1 At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans
together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. He arrived at a town
of the Kosalans named Paṅkadhā, and stayed there.
1.3 Now, at that time a monk called Kassapagotta was resident at
Paṅkadhā. There the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and
inspired the mendicants with a Dhamma talk about the training
rules. Kassapagotta became quite impatient and bitter, thinking,
“This ascetic is much too strict.”
1.7 When the Buddha had stayed in Paṅkadhā as long as he pleased,
he set out for Rājagaha. Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at
Rājagaha, and stayed there.
2.1 Soon after the Buddha left, Kassapagotta became quite remorseful and regretful, thinking, “It’s my loss, my misfortune, that when
the Buddha was talking about the training rules I became quite
impatient and bitter, thinking he was much too strict. Why don’t I
go to the Buddha and confess my mistake to him?”
Then Kassapagotta set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl 2.6
and robe, set out for Rājagaha. Eventually he came to Rājagaha and
the Vulture’s Peak. He went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to
one side, and told him what had happened, saying:
“I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful 3.1
of me to become impatient and bitter when the Buddha was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a
Dhamma talk about the training rules, and to think, ‘This ascetic is
much too strict.’ Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I
will restrain myself in future.”
“Indeed, Kassapa, you made a mistake. But since you have rec- 4.1
ognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly,
I accept it. For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to
recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit
to restraint in the future.
Kassapa, take the case of a senior mendicant who doesn’t want 5.1
to train and doesn’t praise taking up the training. They don’t encourage other mendicants who don’t want to train to take up the
training. And they don’t truthfully and correctly praise at the right
time those mendicants who do want to train. I don’t praise that
kind of senior mendicant. Why is that? Because, hearing that I
praised that mendicant, other mendicants might want to keep company with them. Then they might follow their example, which
would be for their lasting harm and suffering. That’s why I don’t
praise that kind of senior mendicant.
Take the case of a middle mendicant who doesn’t want to train 6.1
…
Take the case of a junior mendicant who doesn’t want to train 6.2
… That’s why I don’t praise that kind of junior mendicant.
Kassapa, take the case of a senior mendicant who does want to 7.1
train and praises taking up the training. They encourage other mendicants who don’t want to train to take up the training. And they
truthfully and correctly praise at the right time those mendicants

is that? Because, hearing that I praised that mendicant, other mendicants might want to keep company with them. Then they might
follow their example, which would be for their lasting welfare and
happiness. That’s why I praise that kind of senior mendicant.
8.1 Take the case of a middle mendicant who wants to train …

why I praise that kind of junior mendicant.”

##### Urgent

_Accāyikasutta_

“Mendicants, a farmer has three urgent duties. What three? A 1.1
farmer swiftly makes sure the field is well ploughed and tilled.
Next they swiftly plant seeds in season. When the time is right,
they swiftly irrigate or drain the field. These are the three urgent
duties of a farmer. That farmer has no special power or ability to
say: ‘Let the crops germinate today! Let them flower tomorrow!
Let them ripen the day after!’ But there comes a time when that
farmer’s crops germinate, flower, and ripen as the seasons change.
In the same way, a mendicant has three urgent duties. What 2.1
three? Undertaking the training in the higher ethics, the higher
mind, and the higher wisdom. These are the three urgent duties
of a mendicant. That mendicant has no special power or ability
to say: ‘Let my mind be freed from defilements by not grasping
today! Or tomorrow! Or the day after!’ But there comes a time—
as that mendicant trains in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and
the higher wisdom—that their mind is freed from defilements by
not grasping.
3.1 So you should train like this: We will have keen enthusiasm for
undertaking the training in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and
the higher wisdom.’ That’s how you should train.”

AN 3.93
##### Seclusion

_Pavivekasutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, wanderers of other religions advocate three kinds of
seclusion. What three? Seclusion in robes, almsfood, and lodgings.
2.1 Wanderers of other religions advocate this kind of seclusion
in robes. They wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpsewrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in
strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair,
or owls’ wings. This is what wanderers of other religions advocate
for seclusion in robes.
3.1 Wanderers of other religions advocate this kind of seclusion in
almsfood. They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce,
rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung.
They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit. This
is what the wanderers of other religions advocate for seclusion in
almsfood.
4.1 Wanderers of other religions advocate this kind of seclusion in
lodgings. They stay in a wilderness, at the root of a tree, in a charnel
ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw, or a threshing-hut.
This is what wanderers of other religions advocate for seclusion in
lodgings. These are the three kinds of seclusion that wanderers of
other religions advocate.
5.1 In this teaching and training, there are three kinds of seclusion
for a mendicant. What three? Firstly, a mendicant is ethical, giving
up unethical conduct, being secluded from it. They have right
view, giving up wrong view, being secluded from it. They’ve ended
defilements, giving up defilements, being secluded from them.
Whenamendicanthasthesethreekindsofseclusion, they’recalled
a mendicant who has reached the peak and the pith, being pure
and consolidated in the core.
When a farmer’s rice field is ripe, they’d have the rice cut swiftly, 6.1
gathered swiftly, transported swiftly, made into heaps swiftly,
threshed swiftly, the straw removed swiftly, winnowed swiftly,
brought over swiftly, pounded swiftly, and have the husks removed
swiftly. In this way that farmer’s crop would reach the peak and the
pith, being pure and consolidated in the core.
In the same way, when a mendicant is ethical, giving up uneth- 7.1
ical conduct, being secluded from it; when they have right view,
giving up wrong view, being secluded from it; when they’ve ended
defilements, giving up defilements, being secluded from them:
they’re called a mendicant who has reached the peak and the pith,
being pure and consolidated in the core.”

AN 3.94
##### Autumn

_Saradasutta_

“In the autumn, the heavens are clear and cloudless. And as the 1.1
sun is rising to the firmament, having dispelled all the darkness of
space, it shines and glows and radiates.
In the same way, when the stainless, immaculate vision of the 2.1
teaching arises in a noble disciple, three fetters are given up: substantialist view, doubt, and misapprehension of precepts and observances.
Afterwards they get rid of two things: covetousness and ill will. 3.1
Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful
qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has
the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and
keeping it connected. If that noble disciple passed away at that
time, they’re bound by no fetter that might return them to this
world.”
AN 3.95
##### Assemblies

_Parisāsutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, these are the three assemblies. What three? An assembly of the best, a divided assembly, and a harmonious assembly.
2.1 And what is an assembly of the best? An assembly where the
senior mendicants are not indulgent or slack, nor are they backsliders. Instead, they take the lead in seclusion, rousing energy
for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized. And those who come afterwards follow their
example. They too are not indulgent or slack, nor are they backsliders. Instead, they take the lead in seclusion, rousing energy for
attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing
the unrealized. This is called an assembly of the best.
3.1 And what is a divided assembly? An assembly where the mendicants argue, quarrel, and dispute, continually wounding each other
with barbed words. This is called a divided assembly.
4.1 And what is a harmonious assembly? An assembly where the
mendicants live in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with
kindly eyes. This is called a harmonious assembly.
5.1 When themendicantsliveinharmonylikethis,theycreatemuch
merit. At that time the mendicants live in a divine dwelling, that
is, the heart’s release by rejoicing. When they’re joyful, rapture
springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes
tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when
they’re blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.
6.1 It’s like when the heavens rain heavily on a mountain top, and
the water flows downhill to fill the hollows, crevices, and creeks.
As they become full, they fill up the pools. The pools fill up the
lakes, the lakes fill up the streams, and the streams fill up the rivers.
And as the rivers become full, they fill up the ocean.
In the same way, when the mendicants are in harmony, appre 7.1
ciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes, they create much
merit. At that time the mendicants live in a divine dwelling, that
is, the heart’s release by rejoicing. When they’re joyful, rapture
springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes
tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when
they’re blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.
These are the three assemblies.” 7.4

In the same way, a mendicant with three qualities is worthy of 1.5
offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a
religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is
the supreme field of merit for the world. What three? It’s when a
mendicant is beautiful, strong, and fast.
And how is a mendicant beautiful? It’s when a mendicant is 2.1
ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves
well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the
slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. That’s how
a mendicant is beautiful.
And howisamendicantstrong? It’swhenamendicantliveswith 3.1
energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing
skillful qualities. They are strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking
off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. That’s how a
mendicant is strong.
4.1 And how is a mendicant fast? Its when a mendicant realizes the
undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very
life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to
the ending of defilements. That’s how a mendicant is fast.
4.4 A mendicantwiththesethreequalitiesisworthyofofferingsdedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme

##### Jute

_Potthakasutta_

1.1 “Jute canvas is ugly, unpleasant to touch, and worthless whether
it’s new, worn in, or worn out. They use worn out jute canvas for
scrubbing pots, or else they just throw it away on the rubbish heap.
2.1 In the same way, if a junior mendicant is unethical, of bad character, this is how they’re ugly, I say. That person is just as ugly
as jute canvas. If you associate with, accompany, and attend to
that person, following their example, it’ll be for your lasting harm
and suffering. This is how they’re unpleasant to touch, I say. That
person is just as unpleasant to touch as jute canvas. Any robes,
almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick that
they receive are not very fruitful or beneficial for the donor. This
is how they’re worthless, I say. That person is just as worthless as
jute canvas.
2.10 If a middle mendicant is unethical, of bad character, this is how
they’re ugly, I say. …
2.11 If a senior mendicant is unethical, of bad character, this is how
they’re ugly, I say. … If you associate with, accompany, and attend
to that person, following their example, it’ll be for your lasting
harm and suffering. …
3.1 If such a senior mendicant speaks among the Saṅgha, the mendicants say: ‘What’s an incompetent fool like you got to say? How
on earth could you imagine you ve got something worth saying!
That person becomes angry and upset, and blurts out things that
make the Saṅgha throw them out, as if they were throwing jute
canvas away on the rubbish heap.
Cloth from Kāsi is beautiful, pleasant to touch, and valuable 4.1
whether it’s new, worn in, or worn out. They use worn out cloth
from Kāsi for wrapping, or else they place it in a fragrant casket.
In the same way, if a junior mendicant is ethical, of good char- 5.1
acter, this is how they’re beautiful, I say. That person is just as
beautiful as cloth from Kāsi. If you associate with, accompany,
and attend to such a person, following their example, it will be for
your lasting welfare and happiness. This is how they’re pleasant to
touch, I say. That person is just as pleasant to touch as cloth from
Kāsi. Any robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies
for the sick that they receive are very fruitful and beneficial for the
donor. This is how they’re valuable, I say. That person is just as
valuable as cloth from Kāsi.
If a middle mendicant is ethical, of good character, this is how 5.9
they’re beautiful, I say. …
If a senior mendicant is ethical, of good character, this is how 5.10
they’re beautiful, I say. …
If such a senior mendicant speaks in the midst of the Saṅgha, 6.1
the mendicants say: ‘Venerables, be quiet! The senior mendicant
is speaking on the teaching and training.’
So you should train like this: ‘We will be like cloth from Kāsi, 6.4
not like jute canvas.’ That’s how you should train.”

AN 3.100
##### A Lump of Salt

_Loṇakapallasutta_

“Mendicants, suppose you say: ‘No matter how this person per- 1.1
forms a deed, they experience it the same way.’ This being so, the
spiritual life could not be lived, and thered be no chance of making
a complete end of suffering.
1.3 Suppose you say: ‘No matter how this person performs a deed,
they experience the result as it should be experienced.’ This being
so, the spiritual life can be lived, and there is a chance of making a
complete end of suffering.
1.5 Take thecaseofapersonwhodoesatrivialbaddeed, butitlands
them in hell. Meanwhile, another person does the same trivial bad
deed, but experiences it in this life, without even a bit left over, let
alone a lot.
2.1 What kind of person does a trivial bad deed, but it lands them
in hell? A person who hasn’t developed their physical endurance,
ethics, mind, or wisdom. They’re small-minded and mean-spirited,
living in suffering. That kind of person does a trivial bad deed, but
it lands them in hell.
3.1 What kind of person does the same trivial bad deed, but experiences it in this life, without even a bit left over, let alone a lot? A
person who has developed their physical endurance, ethics, mind,
and wisdom. They’re not small-minded, but are big-hearted, living
without limits. That kind of person does the same trivial bad deed,
but experiences it in this life, without even a bit left over, not to
speak of a lot.
4.1 Suppose a person was to drop a lump of salt into a mug of water.
What do you think, mendicants? Would that mug of water become
salty and undrinkable?”
4.4 “Yes, sir. Why is that? Because there is only a little water in the
bowl.”
4.7 “Suppose a person was to drop a lump of salt into the Ganges
river. What do you think, mendicants? Would the Ganges river
become salty and undrinkable?”
4.10 “No, sir. Why is that? Because the Ganges river is a vast mass of
water.”
5.1 “This is how it is in the case of a person who does a trivial bad
deed, but it lands them in hell. Meanwhile, another person does
the same trivial bad deed, but experiences it in this life, without
even a bit left over, not to speak of a lot. …
Take the case of a person who is thrown in jail for stealing half a 8.1
dollar, a dollar, or a hundred dollars. While another person isn’t
thrown in jail for stealing half a dollar, a dollar, or a hundred dollars.
What kind of person is thrown in jail for stealing half a dollar, 9.1
a dollar, or a hundred dollars? A person who is poor, with few
possessions and little wealth. That kind of person is thrown in jail
for stealing half a dollar, a dollar, or a hundred dollars.
What kind of person isn’t thrown in jail for stealing half a dollar, 10.1
a dollar, or a hundred dollars? A person who is rich, affluent, and
wealthy. That kind of person isn’t thrown in jail for stealing half a
dollar, a dollar, or a hundred dollars.
This is how it is in the case of a person who does a trivial bad 10.4
deed, but they go to hell. Meanwhile, another person does the
same trivial bad deed, but experiences it in this life, without even a
bit left over, not to speak of a lot. …
It’s like a sheep dealer or butcher. They can execute, jail, fine, 13.1
or otherwise punish one person who steals from them, but not
another.
What kind of person can they punish? A person who is poor, 14.1
with few possessions and little wealth. That’s the kind of person
they can punish.
What kind of person can’t they punish? A ruler or their chief 15.1
ministerwhoisrich, affluent, andwealthy. That’sthekindofperson
they can’t punish. In fact, all they can do is raise their joined palms
and ask: ‘Please, good sir, give me my sheep or pay me for it.’
This is how it is in the case of a person who does a trivial bad 15.6
deed, but it lands them in hell. Meanwhile, another person does
the same trivial bad deed, but experiences it in this life, without
even a bit left over, not to speak of a lot. …
Mendicants, suppose you say: ‘No matter how this person per- 18.1
forms a deed, they experience it the same way.’ This being so, the
spiritual life could not be lived, and there’d be no chance of making
a complete end of suffering.
18.3 Suppose you say: No matter how this person performs a deed,
they experience the result as it should be experienced.’ This being
so, the spiritual life can be lived, and there is a chance of making a
complete end of suffering.”

AN 3.101
##### A Panner

_Paṁsudhovakasutta_

1.1 “Native gold has coarse corruptions: sand, soil, and gravel. A panner or their apprentice pours it into a pan, where they wash, rinse,
and clean it. When that’s been eliminated, there are medium corruptions in the native gold: fine grit and coarse sand. The panner
washes it again. When that’s been eliminated, there are fine corruptions in the native gold: fine sand and black grime. The panner
washes it again. When that’s been eliminated, only golden flecks
remain. A goldsmith or their apprentice places the native gold in a
crucible where they blow, melt, and smelt it. Still the native gold is
not settled and the dross is not totally gone. It’s not pliable, workable, or radiant, but is brittle and not completely ready for working.
But the goldsmith keeps on blowing, melting, and smelting it. The
native gold becomes pliable, workable, and radiant, not brittle, and
ready to be worked. Then the goldsmith can successfully create
any kind of ornament they want, whether a bracelet, earrings, a
necklace, or a golden garland.
2.1 In the same way, a mendicant who is committed to the higher
mind has coarse corruptions: bad bodily, verbal, and mental conduct. A sincere, capable mendicant gives these up, gets rid of,
eliminates, and obliterates them.
2.2 When they’ve been given up and eliminated, there are middling corruptions: sensual, malicious, or cruel thoughts. A sincere,
capable mendicant gives these up, gets rid of, eliminates, and obliterates them.
When they ve been given up and eliminated, there are fine cor 2.3
ruptions: thoughtsoffamily,country,andstatus. Asincere,capable
mendicant gives these up, gets rid of, eliminates, and obliterates
them.
When they’ve been given up and eliminated, only thoughts 2.4
about the teaching are left. That immersion is not peaceful or
sublime or tranquil or unified, but is held in place by forceful suppression.
But there comes a time when that mind is stilled internally; it 2.6
settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi. That immersion is peaceful and sublime and tranquil and unified, not held in
place by forceful suppression. They extend the mind to realize by
insight each and every thing that can be realized by insight; and
they are capable of realizing those things, since each and every one
is within range.
If they wish: ‘May I wield the many kinds of psychic power: 3.1
multiplying myself and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unobstructed through a wall, a rampart, or a
mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it
were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged
through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with my hand
the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling my body
as far as the realm of divinity.’ They are capable of realizing these
things, since each and every one is within range.
If they wish: ‘With clairaudience that is purified and super- 4.1
human, may I hear both kinds of sounds, human and heavenly,
whether near or far.’ They are capable of realizing these things,
since each and every one is within range.
If they wish: ‘May I understand the minds of other beings and 5.1
individuals, having comprehended them with my mind. May I understand mind with greed as “mind with greed”, and mind without
greed as “mind without greed”; mind with hate as “mind with hate”,
and mind without hate as “mind without hate”; mind with delusion as “mind with delusion”, and mind without delusion as “mind
without delusion”; constricted mind as “constricted mind”, and
scattered mind as scattered mind ; expansive mind as expansive
mind”, and unexpansive mind as “unexpansive mind”; mind that
is not supreme as “mind that is not supreme”, and mind that is
supreme as “mind that is supreme”; mind immersed in samādhi as
“mind immersed in samādhi”, and mind not immersed in samādhi
as “mind not immersed in samādhi”; freed mind as “freed mind”,
and unfreed mind as “unfreed mind”.’ They are capable of realizing
these things, since each and every one is within range.
6.1 If they wish: ‘May I recollect many kinds of past lives. That is:
one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred,
a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world
contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the
world contracting and expanding. May I remember: “There, I was
named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my
food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how
my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn
somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I
looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure
and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away
from that place I was reborn here.” May I recollect my many past
lives, with features and details.’ They are capable of realizing these
things, since each and every one is within range.
7.1 If they wish: ‘With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, may I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—
inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad
place—and understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: “These dear beings did bad things by way of
body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they
had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view.
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of
loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however,
did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never
denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to
act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death,
they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.” And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, may I see sentient beings
passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful
and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. And may I understand
how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.’ They are
capable of realizing these things, since each and every one is within
range.
If they wish: ‘May I realize the undefiled freedom of heart and 8.1
freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with
my own insight due to the ending of defilements.’ They are capable
of realizing these things, since each and every one is within range.”

AN 3.102
##### Basis

_Nimittasutta_

“Mendicants, a mendicant committed to the higher mind should 1.1
focus on three bases from time to time: the basis of immersion,
the basis of exertion, and the basis of equanimity.
If a mendicant dedicated to the higher mind focuses solely on 1.3
the basis of immersion, it’s likely their mind will incline to laziness.
If they focus solely on the basis of exertion, it’s likely their mind 1.4
will incline to restlessness.
If they focus solely on the basis of equanimity, it’s likely their 1.5
mind won’t properly become immersed in samādhi for the ending
of defilements.
But when a mendicant dedicated to the higher mind focuses 1.6
from time to time on the basis of immersion, the basis of exertion,
and the basis of equanimity, their mind becomes pliable, workable, and radiant, not brittle, and has become rightly immersed in
samādhi for the ending of defilements.
It’s like when a goldsmith or a goldsmith’s apprentice prepares 2.1
a forge, fires the crucible, picks up some native gold with tongs
and puts it in the crucible. From time to time they fan it, from
time to time they sprinkle water on it, and from time to time they
just watch over it. If they solely fanned it, the native gold would
likely be scorched. If they solely sprinkled water on it, the native
gold would likely cool down. If they solely watched over it, the
native gold would likely not be properly processed. But when that
goldsmith fans it from time to time, sprinkles water on it from time
to time, and watches over it from time to time, that native gold
becomes pliable, workable, and radiant, not brittle, and is ready to
be worked. Then the goldsmith can successfully create any kind of
ornament they want, whether a bracelet, earrings, a necklace, or a
golden garland.
3.1 In the same way, a mendicant committed to the higher mind
should focus on three bases from time to time: the basis of immersion, the basis of exertion, and the basis of equanimity. …
3.6 When a mendicant dedicated to the higher mind focuses from
time to time on the basis of immersion, the basis of exertion, and
the basis of equanimity, their mind becomes pliable, workable, and
radiant, not brittle, and has become rightly immersed in samādhi
for the ending of defilements. They extend the mind to realize by
insight each and every thing that can be realized by insight; and
they are capable of realizing those things, since each and every one
is within range.
4.1 If they wish: ‘May I wield the many kinds of psychic power’ …
4.2 ‘With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, may I hear
both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far.’ …
‘May I recollect many kinds of past lives.’ … ‘With clairvoyance
that is purified and superhuman, may I see sentient beings passing
away and being reborn.’ … ‘May I realize the undefiled freedom
of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having
realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements.’
They are capable of realizing these things, since each and every one
is within range.”

# The Chapter on Awakening

AN 3.103
##### Before Awakening

_Pubbevasambodhasutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened
but intent on awakening—I thought: ‘What’s the gratification in
the world? What’s the drawback? What’s the escape?’
1.3 Then it occurred to me: ‘The pleasure and happiness that arise
from the world: this is its gratification.
1.5 That the world is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this
is its drawback.
1.6 Removing and giving up desire and greed for the world: this is
its escape.’
1.7 As long as I didn’t truly understand the world’s gratification,
drawback, and escape in this way for what they are, I didn’t announce my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods,
Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.
1.8 But when I did truly understand the world’s gratification, drawback, and escape in this way for what they are, I announced my
supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and
Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods
and humans.
1.9 Knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘My freedom is unshakable;
this is my last rebirth; now there’ll be no more future lives.’”
AN 3.104
##### Gratification (1st)

_Paṭhamaassādasutta_

“Mendicants, I went in search of the world’s gratification, and I 1.1
found it. I’ve seen clearly with wisdom the full extent of gratification in the world. I went in search of the world’s drawbacks,
and I found them. I’ve seen clearly with wisdom the full extent of
the drawbacks in the world. I went in search of escape from the
world, and I found it. I’ve seen clearly with wisdom the full extent
of escape from the world.
As long as I didn’t truly understand the world’s gratification, 1.7
drawback, and escape for what they are, I didn’t announce my
supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and
Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods
and humans.
But when I did truly understand the world’s gratification, draw- 1.8
back, and escape for what they are, I announced my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Divinities,
this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.
Knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘My freedom is unshakable; 1.9
this is my last rebirth; now there’ll be no more future lives.’”

AN 3.105
##### Gratification (2nd)

_Dutiyaassādasutta_

“Mendicants, if there were no gratification in the world, sentient 1.1
beings wouldn’t be aroused by it. But because there is gratification
in the world, sentient beings are aroused by it.
If the world had no drawback, sentient beings wouldn’t grow 1.3
disillusioned with it. But since the world has a drawback, sentient
beings do grow disillusioned with it.
1.5 If there were no escape from the world, sentient beings wouldn t
escape from it. But since there is an escape from the world, sentient
beings do escape from it.
1.7 As long as sentient beings don’t truly understand the world’s
gratification, drawback, and escape for what they are, they haven’t
escaped from this world—with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this
population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—
and they don’t live detached, liberated, with a mind free of limits.
1.8 But when sentient beings truly understand the world’s gratification, drawback, and escape for what they are, they’ve escaped from
this world—with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population
with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—and they
live detached, liberated, with a mind free of limits.”

AN 3.106
##### Ascetics and Brahmins

_Samaṇabrāhmaṇasutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, there are ascetics and brahmins who don’t truly understand the world’s gratification, drawback, and escape for what
they are. I don’t deem them as true ascetics and brahmins. Those
venerables don’t realize the goal of life as an ascetic or brahmin,
and don’t live having realized it with their own insight.
1.3 There are ascetics and brahmins who do truly understand the
world’s gratification, drawback, and escape for what they are. I
deem them as true ascetics and brahmins. Those venerables realize
the goal of life as an ascetic or brahmin, and live having realized it
with their own insight.”
AN 3.107
##### Wailing

_Ruṇṇasutta_

“Singing is regarded as wailing in the training of the Noble One. 1.1
Dancing is regarded as madness. Too much laughter, showing the
teeth, is regarded as childish. So break off singing and dancing; and
when you’re appropriately pleased, it’s enough to simply smile.”

AN 3.108
##### Satisfaction

_Atittisutta_

“Mendicants, there are three indulgences that never satisfy. What 1.1
three? Sleep, drinking beerand wine, andsexual intercourse. These
are the three indulgences that never satisfy.”

AN 3.109
##### Unprotected

_Arakkhitasutta_

Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, 1.1
bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:
“Householder, when the mind is unprotected, deeds of body, 1.2
speech, and mind are unprotected. When deeds are unprotected,
they fester. When deeds fester, they become rotten. Someone
whose deeds of body, speech, and mind are rotten will not have a
good death.
It’s like a bungalow with a bad roof. The roof peak, rafters, and 2.1
walls are unprotected. They fester, and become rotten.
In the same way, when the mind is unprotected, bodily, verbal, 3.1
and mental deeds are unprotected. … Someone whose deeds of
body, speech, and mind are rotten will not have a good death.
4.1 When the mind is protected, bodily, verbal, and mental deeds
are protected. When deeds are protected, they don’t fester. When
deeds don’t fester, they don’t become rotten. Someone whose
deeds of body, speech, and mind aren’t rotten will have a good
death.
5.1 It’s like a bungalow with a good roof. The roof peak, rafters, and
walls are protected. They don’t get soaked, and they don’t become
rotten.
6.1 In the same way, when the mind is protected, bodily, verbal, and
mental deeds are protected. … Someone whose deeds of body,
speech, and mind aren’t rotten will have a good death.”

AN 3.110
##### Fallen

_Byāpannasutta_

1.1 Seated to one side, the Buddha said to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika:
1.2 “Householder, when the mind is fallen, bodily, verbal, and mental deeds are fallen. Someone whose deeds of body, speech, and
mind are fallen will not have a good death. It’s like a bungalow with
a bad roof. The roof peak, rafters, and walls fall in. In the same way,
when the mind is fallen, bodily, verbal, and mental deeds are fallen.
Someone whose deeds of body, speech, and mind are fallen will
not have a good death.
2.1 When the mind is not fallen, bodily, verbal, and mental deeds
are not fallen. Someone whose deeds of body, speech, and mind
are not fallen will have a good death. It’s like a bungalow with a
good roof. The roof peak, rafters, and walls are not fallen in. In the
same way, when the mind is not fallen, bodily, verbal, and mental
deeds are not fallen. Someone whose deeds of body, speech, and
mind are not fallen will have a good death.”
AN 3.111
##### Sources (1st)

_Paṭhamanidānasutta_

“Mendicants, there are these three sources that give rise to deeds. 1.1
What three? Greed, hate, and delusion are sources that give rise to
deeds. Any deed that emerges from greed, hate, or delusion—
born, sourced, and originated from greed, hate, or delusion—
is unskillful, blameworthy, results in suffering, and leads to the
creation of more deeds, not their cessation. These are three sources
that give rise to deeds.
There arethesethreesourcesthatgiverisetodeeds. Whatthree? 2.1
Contentment, love, and understanding are sources that give rise to
deeds. Any deed that emerges from contentment, love, or understanding—born, sourced, and originated from contentment, love,
or understanding—is skillful, blameless, results in happiness, and
leads to the cessation of more deeds, not their creation. These are
three sources that give rise to deeds.”

AN 3.112
##### Sources (2nd)

_Dutiyanidānasutta_

“Mendicants, there are these three sources that give rise to deeds. 1.1
What three?
Desire comes up for things that stimulate desire and greed in the 1.3
past, future, or present. And how does desire come up for things
that stimulate desire and greed in the past, future, or present? In
yourheartyouthinkaboutandconsiderthingsthatstimulatedesire
and greed in the past, future, or present. When you do this, desire
comes up, and you get attached to those things. This lust in the
heart is what I call a fetter. That’s how desire comes up for things
that stimulate desire and greed in the past, future, or present.
These are three sources that give rise to deeds. 3.1
4.1 There arethesethreesourcesthatgiverisetodeeds. Whatthree?
Desire doesn’t come up for things that stimulate desire and greed in
the past, future, or present. And how does desire not come up for
thingsthatstimulatedesireandgreedinthepast, future, orpresent?
You understand the future result of things that stimulate desire and
greed in the past, future, or present. When you know this, you
grow disillusioned, your heart becomes dispassionate, and you see
it with penetrating wisdom. That’s how desire doesn’t come up for
things that stimulate desire and greed in the past, future, or present.
7.1 These are three sources that give rise to deeds.”
# The Chapter on Bound for Loss

AN 3.113
##### Bound for Loss

_Āpāyikasutta_

“Mendicants, these three are bound for a place of loss, bound for 1.1
hell, if they don’t give up this fault. What three?
Someone who is unchaste, but claims to be celibate; someone 1.3
who makes a groundless accusation of unchastity against a person
whose celibacy is pure; and someone who has the view, ‘There is
nothing wrong with sensual pleasures,’ so they throw themselves
into sensual pleasures.
These are the three who are bound for a place of loss, bound for 1.6
hell, if they don’t give up this fault.”

AN 3.114
##### Rare

_Dullabhasutta_

“Mendicants, the appearance of three people is rare in the world. 1.1
What three? A Realized One, a perfected one, a fully awakened
Buddha. A teacher of the teaching and training proclaimed by a Realized One. A person who is grateful and thankful. The appearance
of these three people is rare in the world.”
AN 3.115
##### Immeasurable

_Appameyyasutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, these three people are found in the world. What
three? Someone easy to measure, someone hard to measure, and
someone who is immeasurable.
1.4 And who is the person easy to measure? It’s a person who is
restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying mind and
undisciplined faculties. This is called ‘a person easy to measure’.
2.1 And who is the person hard to measure? It’s a person who is not
restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, or loose-tongued. They have
established mindfulness, situational awareness and immersion,
with unified mind and restrained faculties. This is called ‘a person
hard to measure’.
3.1 And who is the immeasurable person? It’s a mendicant who is
perfected, and has ended defilements. This is called ‘an immeasurable person’.
3.4 These are the three people found in the world.”

##### Imperturbable

_Āneñjasutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, these three people are found in the world. What
three?
1.3 First, a person, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with
the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains
in the dimension of infinite space. They enjoy it and like it and
find it satisfying. If they’re set on that, committed to it, and meditate on it often without losing it, when they die they’re reborn in
the company of the gods of the dimension of infinite space. The
lifespan of the gods of infinite space is twenty thousand eons. An
ordinary person stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent,
then they go to hell or the animal realm or the ghost realm. But a
disciple of the Buddha stays there until the lifespan of those gods is
spent, then they’re extinguished in that very life. This is the difference between a learned noble disciple and an unlearned ordinary
person as regards their place of rebirth.
Furthermore, a person, going totally beyond the dimension 2.1
of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and
remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. They enjoy it
and like it and find it satisfying. If they’re set on that, committed to
it, and meditate on it often without losing it, when they die they’re
reborn in the company of the gods of the dimension of infinite
consciousness. The lifespan of the gods of infinite consciousness
is forty thousand eons. An ordinary person stays there until the
lifespan of those gods is spent, then they go to hell or the animal
realm or the ghost realm. But a disciple of the Buddha stays there
until the lifespan of those gods is spent, then they’re extinguished
in that very life. This is the difference between a learned noble
disciple and an unlearned ordinary person as regards their place of
rebirth.
Furthermore, a person, going totally beyond the dimension of 3.1
infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and
remains in the dimension of nothingness. They enjoy it and like
it and find it satisfying. If they’re set on that, committed to it, and
meditate on it often without losing it, when they die they’re reborn
in the company of the gods of the dimension of nothingness. The
lifespan of the gods of nothingness is sixty thousand eons. An
ordinary person stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent,
then they go to hell or the animal realm or the ghost realm. But
a disciple of the Buddha stays there until the lifespan of those
gods is spent, then they’re extinguished in that very life. This is
the difference between a learned noble disciple and an unlearned
ordinary person as regards their place of rebirth.
These are the three people found in the world.” 3.7

##### Failures and Accomplishments

_Vipattisampadāsutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, there are three failures. What three? Failure in ethics,
mind, and view. And what is failure in ethics? It’s when someone
kills living creatures, steals, commits sexual misconduct, and uses
speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. This is called
‘failure in ethics’.
2.1 And what is failure in mind? It’s when someone is covetous and
malicious. This is called ‘failure in mind’.
3.1 And what is failure in view? It’s when someone has wrong view,
a distorted perspective, such as: ‘There’s no meaning in giving,
sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad
deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no such thing as mother and
father, or beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no
ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced,
and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own
insight.’ This is called ‘failure in view’. Some sentient beings, when
their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad
place, the underworld, hell because of failure in ethics, mind, or
view.

arisen, it’s given up; and how, once it’s given up, it doesn’t arise

# The Chapter at Kusināra

AN 3.123
##### At Kusinārā

_Kusinārasutta_

At one time the Buddha was staying near Kusinārā, in the Forest 1.1
of Offerings. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 1.4
“Mendicants, take the case of a mendicant living supported by 2.1
a town or village. A householder or their child approaches and
invites them for the next day’s meal. The mendicant accepts if they
want. When the night has passed, they robe up in the morning,
take their bowl and robe, and approach that householder’s home,
where they sit on the seat spread out. The householder or their
child serves and satisfies them with their own hands with delicious
fresh and cooked foods.
The mendicant thinks: ‘It’s so good that this householder serves 3.1
me with delicious fresh and cooked foods.’ Then they think: ‘I
really hope this householder serves me with delicious fresh and
cooked foods in the future, too.’ They eat that food tied, infatuated, attached, blind to the drawbacks, and not understanding
the escape. They think about it with sensual, malicious, or cruel
thoughts. A gift to such a mendicant is not very fruitful, I say. Why
is that? Because that mendicant is negligent.
4.1 Take another case of a mendicant living supported by a town
or village. A householder or their child approaches and invites
them for the next day’s meal. The mendicant accepts if they want.
When the night has passed, they robe up in the morning, take their
bowl and robe, and approach that householder’s home, where they
sit on the seat spread out. The householder or their child serves
and satisfies them with their own hands with delicious fresh and
cooked foods.
5.1 It never occurs to them: ‘It’s so good that the householder or
their child serves and satisfies me with their own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.’ They don’t think: ‘I really hope
this householder serves me with delicious fresh and cooked foods
in the future, too.’ They eat that almsfood untied, uninfatuated,
unattached, seeing the drawback, and understanding the escape.
They think about it with thoughts of renunciation, good will, or
harmlessness. A gift to such a mendicant is very fruitful, I say. Why
is that? Because that mendicant is diligent.”

AN 3.124
##### Arguments

_Bhaṇḍanasutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, I’m not even comfortable thinking about a place
where mendicants argue—quarreling and disputing, continually
wounding each other with barbed words—let alone going there. I
come to a conclusion about them: ‘Clearly those venerables have
given up three things and cultivated three things.’ What three
things have they given up? Thoughts of renunciation, good will,
and harmlessness. What three things have they cultivated? Sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts. … I come to a conclusion
about them: ‘Clearly those venerables have given up three things
and cultivated three things.’
2.1 I feel comfortable going to a place where the mendicants live in
harmony—appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending
like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes
let alone thinking about it. I come to a conclusion about them:
‘Clearly those venerables have given up three things and cultivated
three things.’ What three things have they given up? Sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts. What three things have they cultivated?
Thoughts of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness. … I come
to a conclusion about them: ‘Clearly those venerables have given
up three things and cultivated three things.’”

##### The Gotamaka Shrine

_Gotamakacetiyasutta_

At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Gotamaka 1.1
Tree-shrine. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 1.4
“Mendicants, I teach based on direct knowledge, not without 2.1
direct knowledge. I teach with reasons, not without them. I teach
with a demonstrable basis, not without it. Since this is so, you
should follow my advice and instruction. This is enough for you
to feel joyful, delighted, and happy: ‘The Blessed One is a fully
awakened Buddha! The teaching is well explained! The Saṅgha is
practicing well!’”
That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants ap- 3.1
proved what the Buddha said. And while this discourse was being
spoken, the thousandfold galaxy shook.

AN 3.126
##### Bharaṇḍu Kālāma

_Bharaṇḍukālāmasutta_

At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans 1.1
when he arrived at Kapilavatthu.
1.2 Mahānāma the Sakyan heard that he had arrived. He went up
to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. The Buddha said
to him, “Go into Kapilavatthu, Mahānāma, and check if there’s a
suitable guest house where I can spend the night.”
2.2 “Yes, sir,” replied Mahānāma. He returned to Kapilavatthu and
searched all over the city, but he couldn’t see a suitable guest house
for the Buddha to spend the night.
3.1 Then Mahānāma went up to the Buddha, and said to him, “Sir,
there’s no suitable guest house in Kapilavatthu for you to spend
the night. But there is this Bharaṇḍu the Kālāma, who used to be
the Buddha’s spiritual companion. Why don’t you spend the night
at his hermitage?”
3.5 “Go, Mahānāma, and set out a mat.”
3.6 “Yes, sir,” replied Mahānāma. He went to Bharaṇḍu’s hermitage,
where he set out a mat, and got foot-washing water ready. Then
he went back to the Buddha and said to him, “The mat and footwashing water are set out. Please, sir, go at your convenience.”
4.1 Then the Buddha went to Bharaṇḍu’s hermitage, sat down on
the seat spread out, and washed his feet.
4.3 Then it occurred to Mahānāma, “It’s too late to pay homage to
the Buddha today. He’s tired. Tomorrow I’ll pay homage to the
Buddha.” He bowed to the Buddha and respectfully circled him,
keeping him on his right, then he left.
5.1 Then, when the night had passed, Mahānāma the Sakyan went
up to the Buddha, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to
him:
5.2 “Mahānāma, there are these three teachers found in the world.
What three? One teacher advocates the complete understanding
of sensual pleasures, but not of forms or feelings. One teacher
advocates the complete understanding of sensual pleasures and
forms, but not of feelings. One teacher advocates the complete
understanding of sensual pleasures, forms, and feelings. These are
the three teachers found in the world. Do these three teachers have
the same goal or different goals?”
When he said this, Bharaṇḍu said to Mahānāma, Say they re 6.1
the same, Mahānāma!”
The Buddha said, “Say they’re different, Mahānāma!” 6.3
For a second time, Bharaṇḍu said, “Say they’re the same, Mahā- 6.5
nāma!”
The Buddha said, “Say they’re different, Mahānāma!” 6.7
For a third time, Bharaṇḍu said, “Say they’re the same, Mahā- 6.9
nāma!”
The Buddha said, “Say they’re different, Mahānāma!” 6.11
Then it occurred to Bharaṇḍu, “The Buddha has rebuked me 7.1
three times in front of this illustrious Mahānāma. Why don’t I
leave Kapilavatthu?” Then Bharaṇḍu the Kālāma left Kapilavatthu,
never to return.

AN 3.127
##### With Hatthaka

_Hatthakasutta_

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, 1.1
Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Then, late at night, the glorious god Hatthaka, lighting up the 1.2
entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha. Thinking, “I will stand
before the Buddha,” he sank and melted down, and wasn’t able to
stay still. It’s like when ghee or oil is poured on sand, it sinks and
melts down, and can’t remain stable.
Then the Buddha said to Hatthaka, “Hatthaka, manifest a solid 2.1
life-form.”
“Yes, sir,” replied Hatthaka. He manifested a solid life-form, 2.3
bowed to the Buddha, and stood to one side.
The Buddha said to him, “Hatthaka, I wonder whether you still 2.4
promulgate now the teachings that you promulgated when you
were a human being?”
3.2 I still promulgate the teachings that I promulgated as a human
being. And I also promulgate teachings that I didn’t promulgate as
a human being.
3.4 Just as the Buddha these days lives crowded by monks, nuns,
laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their chief ministers, and
monastics of other religions and their disciples, so I live crowded
by the gods. The gods come from far away, thinking, ‘We’ll hear
the teaching in the presence of Hatthaka.’
3.7 Sir, I passed away without getting enough of three things. What
three? Seeing the Buddha; hearing the true teaching; and serving
the Saṅgha. I passed away without getting enough of these three
things.

4.1 I could never get enough
of seeing the Buddha,
serving the Saṅgha,
or hearing the teaching.

5.1 Training in the higher ethics,
loving to hear the true teaching,
Hatthaka has gone to the Aviha realm
without getting enough of these three things.”

AN 3.128
##### Bitter

_Kaṭuviyasutta_

1.1 At one time the Buddha was staying near Varanasi, in the deer park
at Isipatana.
1.2 Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl
and robe, entered Varanasi for alms. While the Buddha was walking for alms near the cow-hitching place at the wavy leaf fig, he
saw a disgruntled monk who was looking for pleasure in external
things, unmindful, without situational awareness or immersion,
with straying mind and undisciplined faculties.
The Buddha said to him, Monk, don t be bitter. If you re bitter, 1.4
festering with putrefaction, flies will, without a doubt, plague and
infest you.”
Hearing this advice of the Buddha, that monk was struck with 2.3
a sense of urgency. Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, the Buddha told the mendicants what had happened. …
When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha: 4.1
“Sir, what is this ‘bitterness’? What is ‘putrefaction’? And what 4.5
are the ‘flies’?”
“Desire is bitterness; ill will is the putrefaction; and bad, unskill- 5.1
fulthoughtsaretheflies. Ifyou’rebitter,festeringwithputrefaction,
flies will, without a doubt, plague and infest you.

When your eyes and ears are unguarded, 6.1
and you’re not restrained in your sense faculties,
flies—those lustful thoughts—
will plague you.

A mendicant who’s bitter, 7.1
festering with putrefaction,
is far from being extinguished,
distress is their lot.

Whether in village or wilderness, 8.1
if they don’t find serenity in themselves,
the fool, the simpleton,
is honored only by flies.

But those who have ethics, 9.1
lovers of wisdom and peace,
they, being peaceful, sleep at ease,
since they’ve got rid of the flies.”
AN 3.129
##### With Anuruddha (1st)

_Paṭhamaanuruddhasutta_

1.1 Then Venerable Anuruddha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat
down to one side, and said to him:
1.2 “Sometimes, sir, with my clairvoyance that’s purified and superhuman, I see that females—when their body breaks up, after
death—are mostly reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. How many qualities do females have so that they’re
reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell?”
2.1 “When females have three qualities, when their body breaks
up, after death, they are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the
underworld, hell. What three? A female lives at home with a heart
full of the stain of stinginess in the morning, jealousy at midday,
and sexual desire in the evening. When females have these three
qualities, when their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn
in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.”

AN 3.130
##### With Anuruddha (2nd)

_Dutiyaanuruddhasutta_

1.1 Then Venerable Anuruddha went up to Venerable Sāriputta, and
exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite
conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him:
1.3 “Here’s the thing, Reverend Sāriputta. With clairvoyance that
is purified and surpasses the human, I survey the thousandfold
galaxy. My energy is roused up and unflagging, my mindfulness is
established and lucid, my body is tranquil and undisturbed, and
my mind is immersed in samādhi. But my mind is not freed from
the defilements by not grasping.”
2.1 “Well, Reverend Anuruddha, when you say: ‘With clairvoyance
that is purified and surpasses the human, I survey the thousandfold
galaxy, thatsyourconceit. Andwhenyousay: Myenergyisroused
up and unflagging, my mindfulness is established and lucid, my
body is tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind is immersed in
samādhi,’ that’s your restlessness. And when you say: ‘But my
mind is not freed from the defilements by not grasping,’ that’s your
remorse. It would be good to give up these three things. Ignore
them and apply your mind to freedom from death.”
After sometimeAnuruddhagaveupthesethreethings. Ignoring 3.1
them, he applied his mind to freedom from death. Then Anuruddha, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon
realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very
life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for
which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has 3.3
been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is
nothing further for this place.” And Venerable Anuruddha became
one of the perfected.

AN 3.131
##### Under Cover

_Paṭicchannasutta_

“Mendicants, three things are conveyed under cover, not in the 1.1
open. What three? Females are married with a veil, not unveiled.
Brahmin hymns are conveyed under cover, not openly. Wrong
view is conveyed under cover, not in the open. These three things
are conveyed under cover, not in the open.
Three things shine in the open, not under cover. What three? 2.1
The moon shines in the open, not under cover. The sun shines in
the open, not under cover. The teaching and training proclaimed
by a Realized One shine in the open, not under cover. These three
things shine in the open, not under cover.”

_Lekhasutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, thesethreepeoplearefoundintheworld. Whatthree?
A person like a line drawn in stone, a person like a line drawn in
sand, and a person like a line drawn in water.
1.4 And who is the person like a line drawn in stone? It’s a person
who is often angry, and their anger lingers for a long time. It’s like
a line drawn in stone, which isn’t quickly worn away by wind and
water, but lasts for a long time. In the same way, a person is often
angry, and their anger lingers for a long time. This is called a person
like a line drawn in stone.
2.1 And who is the person like a line drawn in sand? It’s a person
who is often angry, but their anger doesn’t linger long. It’s like a
line drawn in sand, which is quickly worn away by wind and water,
and doesn’t last long. In the same way, a person is often angry, but
their anger doesn’t linger long. This is called a person like a line
drawn in sand.
3.1 And who is the person like a line drawn in water? It’s a person
who, though spoken to by someone in a rough, harsh, and disagreeable manner, still stays in touch, interacts with, and greets them. It’s
like a line drawn in water, which vanishes right away, and doesn’t
last long. In the same way, a person, though spoken to by someone
in a rough, harsh, and disagreeable manner, still stays in touch,
interacts with, and greets them. This is called a person like a line
drawn in water.
3.6 These are the three people found in the world.”
# The Chapter on a Warrior

AN 3.133
##### A Warrior

_Yodhājīvasutta_

“Mendicants, a warrior with three factors is worthy of a king, fit to 1.1
serve a king, and is reckoned as a factor of kingship. What three?
He’s a long-distance shooter, a marksman, one who shatters large
objects. A warrior with these three factors is worthy of a king, fit
to serve a king, and is reckoned as a factor of kingship.
In the same way, a mendicant with three factors is worthy of 1.5
offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a
religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and
is the supreme field of merit for the world. What three? They’re
a long-distance shooter, a marksman, and one who shatters large
objects.
And how is a mendicant a long-distance shooter? It’s when 2.1
a mendicant truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or
present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior;
far or near: all form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine,
I am not this, this is not my self.’ They truly see any kind of feeling
at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle;
inferior or superior; far or near: all feeling—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ They truly
see any kind of perception at all—past, future, or present; internal
or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: all
perception with right understanding: This is not mine, I am not
this, this is not my self.’ They truly see any kind of choices at all—
past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior
or superior; far or near: all choices—with right understanding:
‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ They truly see
any kind of consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal
or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near, all consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not
this, this is not my self.’ That’s how a mendicant is a long-distance
shooter.
3.1 And how is a mendicant a marksman? It’s when a mendicant
truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice
that leads to the cessation of suffering’. That’s how a mendicant is a
marksman.
4.1 And how does a mendicant shatter large objects? It’s when
a mendicant shatters the great mass of ignorance. That’s how a
mendicant shatters large objects.
4.4 A mendicantwiththesethreequalitiesisworthyofofferingsdedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme
field of merit for the world.”

AN 3.134
##### Assemblies

_Parisāsutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, there are these three assemblies. What three? An
assembly educated in fancy talk, an assembly educated in questioning, and an assembly educated to the fullest extent. These are the
three assemblies.”
AN 3.135
##### A Friend

_Mittasutta_

“Mendicants, you should associate with a friend who has three fac- 1.1
tors. What three? They give what is hard to give, they do what is
hard to do, and they bear what is hard to bear. You should associate
with a friend who has these three factors.”

AN 3.136
##### Arising

_Uppādāsutta_

“Mendicants, whether Realized Ones arise or not, this law of nature 1.1
persists, this regularity of natural principles, this invariance of natural principles: all conditions are impermanent. A Realized One
understands this and comprehends it, then he explains, teaches,
asserts, establishes, clarifies, analyzes, and reveals it: ‘All conditions
are impermanent.’
Whether Realized Ones arise or not, this law of nature persists, 1.6
this regularity of natural principles, this invariance of natural principles: all conditions are suffering. A Realized One understands this
and comprehends it, then he explains, teaches, asserts, establishes,
clarifies, analyzes, and reveals it: ‘All conditions are suffering.’
Whether Realized Ones arise or not, this law of nature persists, 1.11
this regularity of natural principles, this invariance of natural principles: all things are not-self. A Realized One understands this
and comprehends it, then he explains, teaches, asserts, establishes,
clarifies, analyzes, and reveals it: ‘All things are not-self.’”
AN 3.137
##### A Hair Blanket

_Kesakambalasutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, a hair blanket is said to be the worst kind of woven
cloth. It’s cold in the cold, hot in the heat, ugly, smelly, and unpleasant to touch. In the same way, the teaching of the bamboo-staffed
ascetic is said to be the worst of all the doctrines of the various
ascetics and brahmins.
2.1 The bamboo-staffed ascetic, that silly man, has this doctrine and
view: ‘There is no power in deeds, action, or energy.’
2.3 Now, all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who
lived in the past taught the efficacy of deeds, action, and energy.
But the bamboo-staffed ascetic opposes them by saying: ‘There is
no power in deeds, action, or energy.’
2.6 All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who will live
in the future will teach the efficacy of deeds, action, and energy.
But the bamboo-staffed ascetic opposes them by saying: ‘There is
no power in deeds, action, or energy.’
2.9 I too, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha in the
present, teach the efficacy of deeds, action, and energy. But the
bamboo-staffed ascetic opposes me by saying: ‘There is no power
in deeds, action, or energy.’
3.1 It’s like a trap set at the mouth of a river, which would bring
harm, suffering, calamity, and disaster for many fish. In the same
way that futile man the bamboo-staffed ascetic is a trap for humans,
it seems to me. He has come into the world for the harm, suffering,
calamity, and disaster of many beings.”
AN 3.138
##### Accomplishment

_Sampadāsutta_

“Mendicants, there are three accomplishments. What three? Ac- 1.1
complishment in faith, ethics, and wisdom. These are the three
accomplishments.”

AN 3.139
##### Growth

_Vuddhisutta_

“Mendicants, there are three kinds of growth. What three? Growth 1.1
in faith, ethics, and wisdom. These are the three kinds of growth.”

AN 3.140
##### A Wild Colt

_Assakhaḷuṅkasutta_

“Mendicants, I will teach you about three wild colts and three wild 1.1
people. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 1.3
“What are the three wild colts? One wild colt is fast, but not 2.1
beautiful or well proportioned. Another wild colt is fast and beautiful, but not well proportioned. While another wild colt is fast,
beautiful, and well proportioned.
These are the three wild colts. 2.5
And what are the three wild people? One wild person is fast, 3.1
but not beautiful or well proportioned. Another wild person is
fast and beautiful, but not well proportioned. While another wild
person is fast, beautiful, and well proportioned.
And how is a wild person fast, but not beautiful or well propor- 4.1
tioned? It’s when a mendicant truly understands: ‘This is suffering’
… This is the origin of suffering … This is the cessation of suffer
ing’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
This is how they’re fast, I say. But when asked a question about
the teaching or training, they falter without answering. This is how
they’re not beautiful, I say. And they don’t receive robes, almsfood,
lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. This is how
they’re not well proportioned, I say. This is how a wild person is
fast, but not beautiful or well proportioned.
5.1 And how is a wild person fast and beautiful, but not well proportioned? It’s when a mendicant truly understands: ‘This is suffering’
… ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
This is how they’re fast, I say. When asked a question about the
teaching or training, they answer without faltering. This is how
they’re beautiful, I say. But they don’t receive robes, almsfood,
lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. This is how
they’re not well proportioned, I say. This is how a wild person is
fast and beautiful, but not well proportioned.
6.1 And how is a wild person fast, beautiful, and well proportioned?
It’s when a mendicant truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ …
‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’
… ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
This is how they’re fast, I say. When asked a question about the
teaching or training, they answer without faltering. This is how
they’re beautiful, I say. They receive robes, almsfood, lodgings,
and medicines and supplies for the sick. This is how they’re well
proportioned, I say. This is how a wild person is fast, beautiful, and
well proportioned.
6.9 These are the three wild people.”
AN 3.141
##### Excellent Horses

_Assaparassasutta_

“Mendicants, I will teach you the three excellent horses and the 1.1
three excellent people. Listen and apply your mind well, I will
speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 1.3
“What arethethreeexcellenthorses? Oneexcellenthorseisfast, 2.1
but not beautiful or well proportioned. Another excellent horse
is fast and beautiful, but not well proportioned. While another
excellent horse is fast, beautiful, and well proportioned.
These are the three excellent horses. 2.5
“What are the three excellent people? One excellent person 3.1
is fast, but not beautiful or well proportioned. Another excellent
person is fast and beautiful, but not well proportioned. While
another excellent person is fast, beautiful, and well proportioned.
And howisanexcellentpersonfast, butnotbeautifulorwellpro- 4.1

fetters, is reborn spontaneously. They’re extinguished there, and
are not liable to return from that world. This is how they’re fast, I
say. But when asked a question about the teaching or training, they
falter without answering. This is how they’re not beautiful, I say.
And they don’t receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines

say. This is how an excellent person is fast and beautiful, but not
well proportioned.
6.1 And how is an excellent person fast, beautiful, and well proportioned? It’s when a mendicant, with the ending of the five lower
fetters, is reborn spontaneously. They’re extinguished there, and
are not liable to return from that world. This is how they’re fast, I
say. When asked a question about the teaching or training, they

an excellent person is fast, beautiful, and well proportioned.
6.9 These are the three excellent people.”

AN 3.142
##### The Thoroughbred

_Assājānīyasutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, I will teach you the three fine thoroughbred horses,
and the three fine thoroughbred people. Listen and apply your
mind well, I will speak.”
1.3 “Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:
2.1 “What are the three fine thoroughbred horses? One fine thoroughbred horse … is fast, beautiful, and well proportioned.
2.4 These are the three fine thoroughbred horses.
3.1 And what are the three fine thoroughbred people? One fine
thoroughbred person … is fast, beautiful, and well proportioned.
4.1 And how is a fine thoroughbred person … fast, beautiful, and
well proportioned? It’s when a mendicant realizes the undefiled
freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they
live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of
defilements. This is how they’re fast, I say. When asked a question
about the teaching or training, they answer without faltering. This
is how they’re beautiful, I say. They receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. This is how they re
well proportioned, I say. This is how a fine thoroughbred person is
fast, beautiful, and well proportioned.
These are the three fine thoroughbred people.” 4.10

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, at the 1.1

spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are the best among gods and
humans. What three? The entire spectrum of an adept’s ethics,

# The Chapter on Practices

AN 3.156–162
##### Untitled Discourses on Three Practices

_Acelakavagga_

“Mendicants, there are three practices. What three? The addicted 1.1
practice, the scorching practice, and the middle practice.
And what’s the addicted practice? It’s when someone has this 1.4
doctrine and view: ‘There’s nothing wrong with sensual pleasures’;
so they throw themselves into sensual pleasures. This is called the
addicted practice.
And what’s the scorching practice? It’s when someone goes 2.1
naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t
come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought
to them, or food prepared on their behalf, or an invitation for a
meal. They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from
someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in
their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman
who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who lives with a man; or where
there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat
or beer or wine, and drink no fermented gruel. They go to just one
house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two
mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls. They feed on
one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day. They
eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so
on, even up to once a fortnight. They live pursuing the practice of
eating food at set intervals.
3.1 They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice
bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung.
They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit.
4.1 They wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping
cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa
grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings.
They tear out their hair and beard, committed to this practice.
They constantly stand, refusing seats. They squat, committed to
persisting in the squatting position. They lie on a mat of thorns,
making a mat of thorns their bed. They’re devoted to ritual bathing
three times a day, including the evening. And so they live pursuing
these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body. This is
called the scorching practice.
5.1 And what’s the middle practice? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … They meditate observing
an aspect of the mind … They meditate observing an aspect of
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and
displeasure for the world. This is called the middle practice.
5.7 These are the three practices.
1.1 Mendicants, therearethreepractices. Whatthree? Theaddicted
practice, the scorching practice, the middle practice.
1.4 And what’s the addicted practice? … This is called the addicted
practice.
2.1 And what is the scorching practice? … This is called the scorching practice.
3.1 And what’s the middle practice? It’s when a mendicant generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives
so that bad, unskillful qualities don’t arise. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad,
unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up. They generate
enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that
skillful qualities arise. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an ef
fort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have
arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are completed
by development. …

Bhikkhu Sujato was born as Anthony Aidan Best on 4/11/1966 in
Perth, Western Australia. He grew up in the pleasant suburbs of Mt
Lawley and Attadale alongside his sister Nicola, who was the good
child. His mother, Margaret Lorraine Huntsman née Pinder, said
“he’ll either be a priest or a poet”, while his father, Anthony Thomas
Best, advised him to “never do anything for money”. He attended
Aquinas College, a Catholic school, where he decided to become
an atheist. At the University of WA he studied philosophy, aiming
to learn what he wanted to do with his life. Finding that what he
wanted to do was play guitar, he dropped out. His main band was
named Martha’s Vineyard, which achieved modest success in the
indie circuit.
A seemingly random encounter with a roadside joey took him
to Thailand, where he entered his first meditation retreat at Wat
Ram Poeng, Chieng Mai in 1992. Feeling the call to the Buddha’s
path, he took full ordination in Wat Pa Nanachat in 1994, where
his teachers were Ajahn Pasanno and Ajahn Jayasaro. In 1997
he returned to Perth to study with Ajahn Brahm at Bodhinyana
Monastery.
He spent several years practicing in seclusion in Malaysia
and Thailand before establishing Santi Forest Monastery in Bundanoon, NSW, in 2003. There he was instrumental in supporting
the establishment of the Theravada bhikkhuni order in Australia
and advocating for women’s rights. He continues to teach in Australiaandglobally, withaspecialconcernforthemoralimplications
of climate change and other forms of environmental destruction.
He has published a series of books of original and groundbreaking
research on early Buddhism.
In 2005 he founded SuttaCentral together with Rod Bucknell
and John Kelly. In 2015, seeing the need for a complete, accurate,
plain English translation of the Pali texts, he undertook the task,
spending nearly three years in isolation on the isle of Qi Mei off
the coast of the nation of Taiwan. He completed the four main
Nikāyas in 2018, and the early books of the Khuddaka Nikāya were
complete by 2021. All this work is dedicated to the public domain
and is entirely free of copyright encumbrance.
In 2019 he returned to Sydney where he established Lokanta
Vihara (The Monastery at the End of the World).

##### Creation Process

Primary source was the digital Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali Tipiṭaka. Translated from the Pali, with reference to several English
translations, especially those of Bhikkhu Bodhi.

##### The Translation

This translation was part of a project to translate the four Pali Nikāyas with the following aims: plain, approachable English; consistent terminology; accurate rendition of the Pali; free of copyright.
It was made during 2016–2018 while Bhikkhu Sujato was staying
in Qimei, Taiwan.
