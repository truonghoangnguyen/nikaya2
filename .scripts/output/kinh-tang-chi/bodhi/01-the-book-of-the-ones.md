306 (1)

"Bhikkhus, I do not see even a single thing on account of which unarisen unwholesome qualities arise and arisen unwholesome qualities increase and expand so much as wrong view. For one of wrong view, unarisen unwholesome qualities arise and arisen unwholesome qualities increase and expand."

307 (2)

"Bhikkhus, I do not see even a single thing on account of which unarisen wholesome qualities arise and arisen wholesome qualities increase and expand so much as right view. [31] For one of right view, unarisen wholesome qualities arise and arisen wholesome qualities increase and expand."

308 (3)

For what reason? Because the view is bad.

"Suppose, bhikkhus, a seed of neem, bitter cucumber, or bitter gourd [^170] were planted in moist soil. Whatever nutrients it takes up from the soil and from the water would all lead to its bitter, pungent, and disagreeable flavor. For what reason? Because the seed is bad.

[^175] Just as a trap set at the mouth of a river would bring about harm, suffering, calamity, and disaster for many fish, so too, the hollow man Makkhali is, as it were, a 'trap for people [^176] who has arisen
in the world for the harm, suffering, calamity, and disaster of many beings." [34]

320 (5)

"Bhikkhus, one who encourages [others] in a badly expounded Dhamma and discipline, and the one whom he encourages, and the one who, thus encouraged, practices in accordance with it, all generate much demerit. For what reason? Because that Dhamma is badly expounded."

321 (6)

"Bhikkhus, one who encourages [others] in a well-expounded Dhamma and discipline, and the one whom he encourages, and the one who, thus encouraged, practices in accordance with it, all generate much merit. For what reason? Because that Dhamma is well expounded."

327 (12)

"Bhikkhus, whoever arouses energy in a well-expounded Dhamma and discipline dwells in happiness. For what reason? Because that Dhamma is well expounded."

328 (13)

"Bhikkhus, just as even a trifling amount of feces is foul smelling, so too I do not praise even a trifling amount of existence, even for a mere finger snap. [^1179]

329 (14)-332 (17) [^180]

(329) "Bhikkhus, just as even a trifling amount of urine is foul smelling... (330) a trifling amount of saliva is foul smelling... (331) a trifling amount of pus is foul smelling ... [35]... (332) a trifling amount of blood is foul smelling, so too I do not praise even a trifling amount of existence, even for a mere finger snap."

## XVI. One Thing - iv. Jambudīpa Repetition Series [Fourth Subchapter] [^181]

333 (1)-347 (15) [^182]

(333) "Just as, bhikkhus, in this Jambudīpa, [^183] delightful parks, groves, landscapes, and lotus ponds are few, while more numerous are the hills and slopes, rivers that are hard to cross, places with stumps and thorns, and rugged mountains, so too those beings are few who are born on dry ground; more numerous are those beings who are born in water."

(334) "...so too those beings are few who are reborn among human beings; more numerous are those beings who have been reborn elsewhere than among human beings."

(336) "...so too those beings are few who are wise, intelligent, astute, able to understand the meaning of what has been well stated and badly stated; more numerous are those who are
unwise, stupid, obtuse, unable to understand the meaning of what has been well stated and badly stated."

(337) "...so too those beings are few who are endowed with the noble eye of wisdom; more numerous are those beings who are confused and immersed in ignorance. [^185]

(338) "...so too those beings are few who get to see the Tathāgata; more numerous are those beings who do not get to see him."

(339) "...so too those beings are few who get to hear the Dhamma and discipline expounded by the Tathāgata; [36] more numerous are those who do not get to hear it."

(340) "... so too those beings are few who, having heard the Dhamma, retain it in mind; more numerous are those who, having heard the Dhamma, do not retain it in mind."

(343) "...so too those beings are few who acquire a sense of urgency about things inspiring urgency; more numerous are those who do not acquire a sense of urgency about things inspiring urgency."187

(344) "...so too those beings are few who, when inspired with a sense of urgency, strive carefully; more numerous are those who, when inspired with a sense of urgency, do not strive carefully."

(345) "...so too those beings are few who gain concentration, one-pointedness of mind, based on release; more numerous are those who do not gain concentration, one-pointedness of mind, based on release. [^188]

(346) "...so too those beings are few who obtain the exquisite taste of delicious food; more numerous are those who do not gain such food but subsist on scraps brought in a bowl."

(347) "...so too those beings are few who obtain the taste of the meaning, the taste of the Dhamma, the taste of liberation; more
numerous are those who do not obtain the taste of the meaning, the taste of the Dhamma, the taste of liberation. [^189] Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will obtain the taste of the meaning, the taste of the Dhamma,'the taste of liberation.' It is in such a way that you should train yourselves." [37]

348(16)-377(45)[^190]

(348)-(350) "Just as, bhikkhus, in this Jambudīpa delightful parks, groves, landscapes, and lotus ponds are few, while more numerous are the hills and slopes, rivers that are hard to cross, places with stumps and thorns, and rugged mountains, so too those beings are few who, when they pass away as human beings, are reborn among human beings. More numerous are those who, when they pass away as human beings, are reborn in hell...in the animal realm... in the sphere of afflicted spirits."191
