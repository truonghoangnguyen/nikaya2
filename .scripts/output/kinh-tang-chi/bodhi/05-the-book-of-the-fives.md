## I. The Trainee's Powers

## 1 (1) In Brief

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, there are these five trainee's powers. [^974] What five? The power of faith, the power of moral shame, the power of moral dread, the power of energy, and the power of wisdom. These are the five trainee's powers. Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will possess the power of faith, a trainee's power; we will possess the power of moral shame, a trainee's power; we will possess the power of moral dread, a trainee's power; we will possess the power of wisdom, a trainee's power.' Thus, bhikkhus, should you train yourselves." [This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed One's statement. ][^975] [2]

## 2 (2) In Detail

At Sāvatthī. "Bhikkhus, there are these five trainee's powers. What five? The power of faith, the power of moral shame, the
power of moral dread, the power of energy, and the power of wisdom.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the power of faith? Here, a noble disciple is endowed with faith. He places faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' This is called the power of faith.

(2) "And what is the power of moral shame? Here, a noble disciple has a sense of moral shame; he is ashamed of bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct; he is ashamed of acquiring evil, unwholesome qualities. This is called the power of moral shame.

(3) "And what is the power of moral dread? Here, a noble disciple dreads wrongdoing; he dreads bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct; he dreads acquiring evil, unwholesome qualities. This is called the power of moral dread. [^976]

(4) "And what is the power of energy? Here, a noble disciple has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities. This is called the power of energy.

(5) "And what is the power of wisdom? Here, a noble disciple is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. [^977] This is called the power of wisdom.

"These are the five trainee's powers. Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will possess the power of faith, a trainee's power; we will possess the power of moral shame, a trainee's power; we will possess the power of moral dread, [3] a trainee's power; we will possess the power of energy, a trainee's power; we will possess the power of wisdom, a trainee's power.' Thus, bhikkhus, should you train yourselves."

# 3 (3) Suffering

"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a bhikkhu dwells in suffering in this very life-with distress, anguish, and fever-and with the breakup of the body, after death, a bad destination can
be expected for him. What five? Here, a bhikkhu is devoid of faith, morally shameless, morally reckless, lazy, and unwise. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu dwells in suffering in this very life-with distress, anguish, and fever-and with the breakup of the body, after death, he can expect a bad destination.

"Bhikkhus, possessing five [other] qualities, a bhikkhu dwells happily in this very life-without distress, anguish, and feverand with the breakup of the body, after death, a good destination can be expected for him. What five? Here, a bhikkhu is endowed with faith, has a sense of moral shame, has moral dread, and is energetic and wise. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu dwells happily in this very life-without distress, anguish, and fever-and with the breakup of the body, after death, a good destination can be expected for him."

# 4 (4) As If Brought There

"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a bhikkhu is deposited in hell as if brought there. What five? Here, a bhikkhu is devoid of faith, morally shameless, morally reckless, lazy, and unwise. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu is deposited in hell as if brought there. [4]

"Bhikkhus, possessing five [other] qualities, a bhikkhu is deposited in heaven as if brought there. What five? Here, a bhikkhu is endowed with faith, has a sense of moral shame, has moral dread, and is energetic and wise. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu is deposited in heaven as if brought there."

## 5 (5) Training

"Bhikkhus, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who gives up the training and reverts to the lower life incurs five reasonable criticisms and grounds for censure in this very life. What five? (1) 'You did not have faith in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. (2) You did not have a sense of moral shame in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. (3) You did not have moral dread in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. (4) You did not have energy in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. (5) You did not have wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities.' Any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who gives up the training and reverts to the lower life incurs
these five reasonable criticisms and grounds for censure in this very life.

"Bhikkhus, any bhikkhu or bhikkhuni who lives the complete and pure spiritual life, even with pain and dejection, weeping with a tearful face, gains five reasonable grounds for praise in this very life. What five? (1)'You have had faith in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. (2) You have had a sense of moral shame in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. (3) You have had moral dread in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. (4) You have had energy in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. (5) You have had wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities.' Any bhikkhu or bhikkhuni who lives the complete and pure spiritual life, even with pain and dejection, weeping with a tearful face, [5] gains these five reasonable grounds for praise in this very life."

# 6 (6) Entering

(1) "Bhikkhus, there is no entering upon the unwholesome so long as faith is securely settled in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. But when faith has disappeared and lack of faith obsesses one, then there is the entering upon the unwholesome.

(2) "There is no entering upon the unwholesome so long as a sense of moral shame is securely settled in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. But when a sense of moral shame has disappeared and moral shamelessness obsesses one, then there is the entering upon the unwholesome.

(3) "There is no entering upon the unwholesome so long as moral dread is securely settled in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. But when moral dread has disappeared and lack of moral dread obsesses one, then there is the entering upon the unwholesome.

(4) "There is no entering upon the unwholesome so long as energy is securely settled in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. But when energy has disappeared and laziness obsesses one, then there is the entering upon the unwholesome.

(5) "There is no entering upon the unwholesome so long as wisdom is securely settled in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. But when wisdom has disappeared and lack of wisdom obsesses one, then there is the entering upon the unwholesome."

# 7 (7) Sensual Pleasures

"Bhikkhus, beings for the most part are captivated by sensual pleasures. When a clansman has forsaken the sickle and carrying-pole and gone forth from the household life into homelessness, he can be described as a clansman who has gone forth out of faith. For what reason? Sensual pleasures, whether of this or that kind, can be obtained by a youth. Inferior sensual pleasures, middling sensual pleasures, and superior sensual pleasures are all reckoned simply as sensual pleasures. [6]

"Suppose a young infant boy, ignorant, lying on his back, were to put a stick or pebble in his mouth because of his nurse's heedlessness. His nurse would quickly attend to him and try to take it out. If she could not quickly take it out, she would brace the boy's head with her left hand and, hooking a finger of her right hand, she would take it out even if she had to draw blood. For what reason? There would be some distress for the boy-this I don't deny-but the nurse has to do so for his good and welfare, out of compassion for him. However, when the boy has grown up and has enough sense, the nurse would be unconcerned about him, thinking: 'The boy can now look after himself. He won't be heedless.'

"So too, so long as a bhikkhu is still not accomplished in faith in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, in a sense of shame in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, in moral dread in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, in energy in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, and in wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, I must still look after him. But when that bhikkhu is accomplished in faith in [cultivating] wholesome qualities .... accomplished in wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, then I am unconcerned about him, thinking: 'The bhikkhu can now look after himself. He won't be heedless." [^978]

# II. POWERS

## 11 (1) Not Heard Before

"Bhikkhus, I claim to have attained the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge regarding things not heard before. [^979]

"There are these five Tathāgata's powers that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he claims the place of the chief bull, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the brahma wheel. [^980] What five? The power of faith, the power of moral shame, the power of moral dread, the power of energy, and the power of wisdom. These are the five Tathāgata's powers that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he claims the place of
the chief bull, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the brahma wheel." [10]

# 12 (2) Peak (1)

"Bhikkhus, there are these five trainee's powers. What five? The power of faith, the power of moral shame, the power of moral dread, the power of energy, and the power of wisdom. These are the five trainee's powers. Among these five trainee's powers, the power of wisdom is foremost, the one that holds all the others in place, the one that unifies them. Just as the peak is the chief part of a peaked-roof house, the part that holds all the others in place, that unifies them, so among these five trainee powers, the power of wisdom is foremost, the one that holds all the others in place, the one that unifies them.

"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: (1) 'We will possess the power of faith, a trainee's power; (2) the power of moral shame, a trainee's power; (3) the power of moral dread, a trainee's power; (4) the power of energy, a trainee's power; (5) the power of wisdom, a trainee's power.' Thus, bhikkhus, should you train yourselves."

## 13 (3) In Brief

## 14 (4) In Detail

"Bhikkhus; there are these five powers. What five? The power of faith, the power of energy, the power of mindfulness, the power of concentration, and the power of wisdom.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the power of faith? Here, a noble disciple is endowed with faith. He places faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened... [as in 5:2] . . . the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' [11] This is called the power of faith.

(3) "And what is the power of mindfulness? Here, the noble disciple is mindful, possessing supreme mindfulness and alertness, one who remembers and recollects what was done and said long ago. This is called the power of mindfulness.

(4) "And what is the power of concentration? Here, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. With the subsiding of thought and examination, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration, without thought and examination. With the fading away as well of rapture, he dwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, he experiences pleasure with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: 'He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.' With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity. This is called the power of concentration.

(5) "And what is the power of wisdom? Here, a noble disciple is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. This is called the power of wisdom.

# III. Five Factored

21 (1) Irreverent (1)

"(1) Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is irreverent and undeferential, and his behavior is uncongenial to his fellow monks, it is impossible for him to fulfill the factor of proper conduct. [15] (2) Without fulfilling the factor of proper conduct, it is impossible for him to fulfill the factor of a trainee. (3) Without fulfilling the factor of a trainee, it is impossible for him to fulfill virtuous behavior. (4) Without fulfilling virtuous behavior, it is impossible for him to fulfill right view. (5) Without fulfilling right view, it is impossible for him to fulfill right concentration. [^983]

"(1) But, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is reverential and deferential, and his behavior is congenial to his fellow monks, it is possible for him to fulfill the duty of proper conduct. (2) Having fulfilled the duty of proper conduct, it is possible for him to fulfill the duty of a trainee. (3) Having fulfilled the duty of a trainee, it is possible for him to fulfill virtuous behavior. (4) Having fulfilled virtuous behavior, it is possible for him to fulfill right view. (5) Having fulfilled right view, it is possible for him to fulfill right concentration."

## 22 (2) Irreverent (2)

"(1) Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is irreverent and undeferential, and his behavior is uncongenial to his fellow monks, it is impossible for him to fulfill the factor of proper conduct. (2) Without fulfilling the factor of proper conduct, it is impossible for him to fulfill the factor of a trainee. (3) Without fulfilling the factor of a trainee, it is impossible for him to fulfill the aggregate of virtuous behavior. (4) Without fulfilling the aggregate of virtuous behavior, it is impossible for him to fulfill the aggregate of concentration. (5) Without fulfilling the aggregate of concentration, it is impossible for him to fulfill the aggregate of wisdom.

"(1) But, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is reverential and deferential, and his behavior is congenial to his fellow monks, it is possible for him to fulfill the factor of proper conduct. (2)

Having fulfilled the.factor of proper conduct, it is possible for him to fulfill the factor of a trainee. (3) Having fulfilled the factor of a trainee, it is possible for him to fulfill the aggregate of virtuous behavior. (4) Having fulfilled the aggregate of virtuous behavior, it is possible for him to fulfill the aggregate of concentration. [16] (5) Having fulfilled the aggregate of concentration, it is possible for him to fulfill the aggregate of wisdom."

# 23 (3) Defilements

"Bhikkhus, [^984] there are these five defilements of gold, defiled by which gold is not malleable, wieldy, and luminous, but brittle and not properly fit for work. What five? Iron, copper, tin, lead, and silver. These are the five defilements of gold, defiled by which gold is not malleable, wieldy, and luminous, but brittle and not properly fit for work. But when gold is freed from these five defilements, it is malleable, wieldy, and luminous, pliant and properly fit for work. Then whatever kind of ornament one wishes to make from it-whether a bracelet, earrings, a necklace, or a golden garland-one can achieve one's purpose. [^985]

"So too, bhikkhus, there are these five defilements of the mind, defiled by which the mind is not malleable, wieldy, and luminous, but brittle and not properly concentrated for the destruction of the taints. What five? Sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. These are the five defilements of the mind, defiled by which the mind is not malleable, wieldy, and luminous, but brittle and not properly concentrated for the destruction of the taints. But when the mind is freed from these five defilements, it becomes malleable, wieldy, [17] and luminous, pliant and properly concentrated for the destruction of the taints. Then, there being a suitable basis, one is capable of realizing any state realizable by direct knowledge toward which one might incline the mind. [^986]

"If one wishes: 'May I wield the various kinds of psychic potency: having been one, may I become many; having been many, may I become one; may I appear and vanish; may I go unhindered through a wall, through a rampart, through a mountain as though through space; may I dive in and out of the earth as though it were water; may I walk on water without sinking as though it were earth; seated cross-legged; may I travel in space like a bird; with my hand may I touch and stroke
the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; may I exercise mastery with the body as far as the brahmā world,' one is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.

"If one wishes: 'May I, with the divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the human, hear both kinds of sounds, the divine and human, those that are far as well as near,' one is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.

"If one wishes: 'May I understand the minds of other beings and persons, having encompassed them with my own mind. May I understand a mind with lust as a mind with lust, and a mind without lust as a mind without lust; [18] a mind with hatred as a mind with hatred, and a mind without hatred as a mind without hatred; a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion, and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion; a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted; an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted; a surpassable mind as surpassable and an unsurpassable mind as unsurpassable; a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated; a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated,' one is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.

"If one wishes: 'May I recollect my manifold past abodes, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many eons of world-dissolution, many eons of world-evolution, many eons of world-dissolution and world-evolution thus: "There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere, and there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn here"-may I thus recollect my manifold past abodes with their aspects and details,' one is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis. [19]

"If one wishes: 'May I, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, see beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and understand how beings fare in accordance
with their kamma thus: "These beings who engaged in misconduct by body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong view, and undertook kamma based on wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; but these beings who engaged in good conduct by body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right view, and undertook kamma based on right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world"-thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, may I see beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and understand how beings fare in accordance with their kamma,' one is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.

"If one wishes: 'May I, with the destruction of the taints, in this very life realize for myself with direct knowledge the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, may I dwell in it,' one is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis."

# 24 (4) Immoral

"Bhikkhus, (1) for an immoral person, for one deficient in virtuous behavior, (2) right concentration lacks its proximate cause. When there is no right concentration, for one deficient in right concentration, (3) the knowledge and vision of things as they really are lacks its proximate cause. When there is no knowledge and vision of things as they really are, for one deficient in the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, (4) disenchantment and dispassion lack their proximate cause. When there is no disenchantment and dispassion, for one deficient in disenchantment and dispassion, (5) the knowledge and vision of liberation lacks its proximate cause. [^987]

"Suppose there is a tree deficient in branches and foliage. Then its shoots do not grow to fullness; also its bark, [20] softwood, and heartwood do not grow to fullness. So too, for an immoral person, one deficient in virtuous behavior, right concentration lacks its proximate cause. When there is no right concentration ... the knowledge and vision of liberation lacks its proximate cause.
"Bhikkhus, (1) for a virtuous person, for one whose behavior is virtuous, (2) right concentration possesses its proximate cause. When there is right concentration, for one possessing right concentration, (3) the knowledge and vision of things as they really are possesses its proximate cause. When there is the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, for one possessing the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, (4) disenchantment and dispassion possess their proximate cause. When there is disenchantment and dispassion, for one possessing disenchantment and dispassion; (5) the knowledge and vision of liberation possesses its proximate cause:

"Suppose there is a tree possessing branches and foliage. Then its shoots grow to fullness; also its bark, softwood, and heartwood grow to fullness. So too, for a virtuous person, one whose behavior is virtuous, right concentration possesses its proximate cause. When there is right concentration... the knowledge and vision of liberation possesses its proximate cause."

# 25 (5) Assisted

"Bhikkhus, when right view is assisted by five factors, it has liberation of mind as its fruit, liberation of mind as its fruit and benefit; it has liberation by wisdom as its fruit, liberation by wisdom as its fruit and benefit. [^988] What five? [21] Here, right view is assisted by virtuous behavior, learning, discussion, calm, and insight. When right view is assisted by these five factors, it has liberation of mind as its fruit, liberation of mind as its fruit and benefit; it has liberation by wisdom as its fruit, liberation by wisdom as its fruit and benefit."

## 26 (6) Liberation

"Bhikkhus, there are these five bases of liberation [^989] by means of which, if a bhikkhu dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute, his unliberated mind is liberated, his undestroyed taints are utterly destroyed, and he reaches the as-yet-unreached unsurpassed security from bondage. What five?

(1) "Here, bhikkhus, the Teacher or a fellow monk in the position of a teacher teaches the Dhamma to a bhikkhu. In whatever way the Teacher or that fellow monk in the position of a teacher teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhu, in just that way he experiences inspiration in the meaning and inspiration in
the Dhamma. [^990] As he does so, joy arises in him. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. [^991] This is the first basis of liberation, by means of which, if a bhikkhu dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute, his unliberated mind is liberated, his undestroyed taints are utterly destroyed, and he reaches the as-yet-unreached unsurpassed security from bondage.

(2) "Again, neither the Teacher nor a fellow monk in the position of a teacher teaches the Dhamma to a bhikkhu, but he himself teaches the Dhamma to others in detail as he has heard it and learned it. In whatever way the bhikkhu [22] teaches the Dhamma to others in detail as he has heard it and learned it, in just that way, in relation to that Dhamma, he experiences inspiration in the meaning and inspiration in the Dhamma. As he does so, joy arises in him: When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is the second basis of liberation, by means of which, if a bhikkhu dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute, his unliberated mind is liberated, his undestroyed taints are utterly destroyed, and he reaches the as-yet-unreached unsurpassed security from bondage.

(3) "Again, neither the Teacher nor a fellow monk in the position of a teacher teaches the Dhamma to a bhikkhu, nor does he himself teach the Dhamma to others in detail as he has heard it and learned it, but he recites the Dhamma in detail as he has heard it and learned it. In whatever way the bhikkhu recites the Dhamma in detail as he has heard it and learned it, in just that way, in relation to that Dhamma, he experiences inspiration in the meaning and inspiration in the Dhamma. As he does so, joy arises in him. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is the third basis of liberation, by means of which, if a bhikkhu dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute, his unliberated mind is liberated, his undestroyed taints are utterly destroyed, and he reaches the as-yet-unreached unsurpassed security from bondage.

(4) "Again, neither the Teacher nor a fellow monk in the
position of a teacher teaches the Dhamma to a bhikkhu, nor does he teach the Dhamma to others in detail as he has heard it and learned it, nor does he recite the Dhamma in detail as he has heard it and learned it, but he ponders, [23] examines, and mentally inspects the Dhamma as he has heard it and learned it. In whatever way the bhikkhu ponders, examines, and mentally inspects the Dhamma as he has heard it and learned it, in just that way, in relation to that Dhamma, he experiences inspiration in the meaning and inspiration in the Dhammá. As he does so, joy arises in him. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in. body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is the fourth basis of liberation, by means of which, if a bhikkhu dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute, his unliberated mind is liberated, his undestroyed taints are utterly destroyed, and he reaches the as-yet-unreached unsurpassed security from bondage.

(5) "Again, neither the Teacher nor a fellow monk in the position of a teacher teaches the Dhamma to a bhikkhu, nor does he teach the Dhamma to others in detail as he has heard it and learned it, nor does he recite the Dhamma in detail as he has heard it and learned it, nor does he ponder, examine, and mentally inspect the Dhamma as he has heard it and learned it, but he has grasped well a certain object of concentration, attended to it well, sustained it well, and penetrated it well with wisdom. In whatever way the bhikkhu has grasped well a certain object of concentration, attended to it well, sustained it well, and penetrated it well with wisdom, in just that way, in relation to that Dhamma, he experiences inspiration in the meaning and inspiration in the Dhamma. As he does so, joy arises in him. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is the fifth basis of liberation, by means of which, if a bhikkhu dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute, [24] his unliberated mind is liberated, his undestroyed taints are utterly destroyed, and he reaches the as-yet-unreached unsurpassed security from bondage.

"These, bhikkhus, are the five bases of liberation, by means of which, if a bhikkhu dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute, his
unliberated mind is liberated, his undestroyed taints are utterly destroyed, and he reaches the as-yet-unreached unsurpassed security from bondage."

# 27 (7) Concentration

"Bhikkhus, being alert and mindful, develop concentration that is measureless. [^992] When, alert and mindful, you develop concentration that is measureless, five kinds of knowledge arise that are personally yours. What five? (1) The knowledge arises that is personally yours: 'This concentration is presently pleasant and in the future has a pleasant result.' (2) The knowledge arises that is personally yours: 'This concentration is noble and spiritual.' (3) The knowledge arises that is personally yours: 'This concentration is not practiced by low persons.' (4) The knowledge arises that is personally yours: 'This concentration is peaceful and sublime, gained by full tranquilization, and attained to unification; it is not reined in and checked by forcefully suppressing [the defilements]. [^993] (5) The knowledge arises that is personally yours: 'I enter this concentration [^994] mindfully and I emerge from it mindfully.' Bhikkhus, being alert and continuously mindful, develop concentration that is measureless. When you are alert and mindful, developing concentration that is measureless, these five kinds of knowledge arise that are personally yours." [25]

## 28 (8) Five-Factored

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you the development of noble fivefactored right concentration. [^995] Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"And what, bhikkhus, is the development of noble fivefactored right concentration?

(1) "Here, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. He makes the rapture and happiness born of seclusion drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the rapture and happiness born of seclusion.

Just as a skillful bath man or a bath man's apprentice might heap bath powder in a metal basin and, sprinkling it gradually with water, would knead it until the moisture wets his ball of bath powder, soaks it, and pervades it inside and out, yet the ball itself does not ooze; so too, the bhikkhu makes the rapture and happiness born of seclusion drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the rapture and happiness bom of seclusion. This is the first development of noble five-factored right concentration.

(2) "Again, with the subsiding of thought and examination, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration, without thought and examination. He makes the rapture and happiness born of concentration drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the rapture and happiness born of concentration. Just as there might be a lake whose waters welled up from below with no inflow from east, west, north, [26] or south, and the lake would not be replenished from time to time by showers of rain, then the cool fount of water welling up in the lake would make the cool water drench, steep, fill, and pervade the lake, so that there would be no part of the whole lake that is not pervaded by cool water; so too, the bhikkhu makes the rapture and happiness born of concentration drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the rapture and happiness born of concentration. This is the second development of noble five-factored right concentration.

(3) "Again, with the fading away as well of rapture, a bhikkhu dwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, he experiences pleasure with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: 'He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.' He makes the happiness divested of rapture drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the happiness divested of rapture. Just as, in a pond of blue or red or white lotuses, some lotuses that are born and grow in the water might thrive immersed in the water without rising out of it, and cool water would drench, steep, fill, and
pervade them to their tips and their roots, so that there would be no part of those lotuses that would not be pervaded by cool water; so too, the bhikkhu makes the happiness divested of rapture.drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the happiness divested of rapture. This is the third development of noble five-factored right concentration.

(4) "Again, with the abandoning of pleasure [27] and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity. He sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind, so that there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the pure bright mind. Just as a man might be sitting covered from the head down with a white cloth, so that there would be no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the white cloth; so too, the bhikkhu sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind, so that there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the pure bright mind. This is the fourth development of noble five-factored right concentration.

(5) "Again, a bhikkhu has grasped well the object of reviewing, [^996] attended to it well, sustained it well, and penetrated it well with wisdom. Just as one person might look upon another-as one standing might look upon one sitting down, or one sitting down might look upon one lying down-so too, a bhikkhu has grasped well the object of reviewing, attended to it well, sustained it well, and penetrated it well with wisdom. This is the fifth development of noble five-factored right concentration.

"When, bhikkhus, noble five-factored right concentration has been developed and cultivated in this way, then, there being a suitable basis, he is capable of realizing any state realizable by direct knowledge toward which he might incline his mind. [^997]

"Suppose a water jug full of water has been set out on a stand, the jug being full of water right up to the brim so that crows could drink from it. If a strong man would tip it in any direction, would water come out?"

"Yes, [28] Bhante."

"So too, bhikkhus, when noble five-factored right concentration has been developed and cultivated in this way, then, there being a suitable basis, he is capable of realizing any state
realizable by direct knowledge toward which he might incline his mind.

"Suppose on level ground there was a four-sided pond, contained by an embankment, full of water right up to the brim so that crows could drink from it. If a strong man were to remove the embankment on any side, would water come out?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"So too, bhikkhus, when noble five-factored right concentration has been developed and cultivated in this way, then, there being a suitable basis, he is capable of realizing any state realizable by direct knowledge toward which he might incline his mind.

"Suppose on even ground at a crossroads a chariot was standing harnessed to thoroughbreds, with a goad ready at hand, so that a skillful trainer, the charioteer, could mount it, and taking the reins in his left hand and the goad in his right, might drive out and return wherever and whenever he likes. So too, bhikkhus, when noble five-factored right concentration has been developed and cultivated in this way, then, there being a suitable basis, he is capable of realizing any state realizable by direct knowledge toward which he might incline his mind.

"If he wishes: 'May I wield the various kinds of psychic potency: [29] having been one, may I become many ... [here and below as in 5:23]... may I exercise mastery with the body as far as the brahmā world,' he is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.

"If he wishes: 'May I, with the divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the human, hear both kinds of sounds, the divine and human, those that are far as well as near,' he is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.

"If he wishes: 'May I understand the minds of other beings and persons, having encompassed them with my own mind. May I understand . . . an unliberated mind as unliberated,' he is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.

"If he wishes:'May I recollect my manifold past abodes . . . with their aspects and details,' he is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.

"If he wishes: 'May I, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, see beings passing away and being reborn . . . and understand how beings fare in accordance with
their kamma,' he is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.

"If he wishes: 'May I, with the destruction of the taints, in this very life realize for myself with direct knowledge the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, may I dwell in it,' he is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis."

# 29 (9) Walking Meditation

"Bhikkhus, there are these five benefits of walking meditation. What five? [30] One becomes capable of journeys; one becomes capable of striving; one becomes healthy; what one has eaten, drunk, consumed, and tasted is properly digested; the concentration attained through walking meditation is long lasting. [^998] These are the five benefits of walking meditation."

## 30 (10) Nagita

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Sangha of bhikkhus when he reached the Kosalan brahmin village named Icchānañgala. There the Blessed One dwelled in the Icchānañgala woodland thicket. The brahmin householders of Icchānañgala heard: "It is said that the ascetic Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan family, has arrived at Icchānañgala and is now dwelling in the Icchānañgala woodland thicket. Now a good report about that Master Gotama has circulated thus: 'That Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One. Having realized by his own direct knowledge this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, he makes it known to others. He teaches a Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; he reveals a spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure.' Now it is good to see such arahants."

Then, when the night had passed, the brahmin householders of Icchānañgala took abundant food of various kinds and went
to the Icchānañgala woodland thicket. They stood outside the entrance making an uproar and a racket. [31] Now on that occasion the Venerable Nāgita was the Blessed One's attendant. The Blessed One addressed the Venerable Nāgita: "Who is making such an uproar and a racket, Nāgita? One would think it was fishermen at a haul of fish."

"Bhante, these are the brahmin householders of Icchānañgala who have brought abundant food of various kinds. They are standing outside the entrance, [wishing to offer it] to the Blessed One and the Sangha of bhikkhus."

"Let me never come upon fame, Nāgita, and may fame never catch up with me. One who does not gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, this bliss of renunciation, bliss of solitude, bliss of peace, bliss of enlightenment that I gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, might accept that vile pleasure, that slothful pleasure, the pleasure of gain, honor, and praise."

"Let the Blessed One now consent, Bhante, let the Fortunate One consent. This is now the time for the Blessed One to consent. Wherever the Blessed One will go now, the brahmin householders of town and countryside will incline in the same direction. Just as, when thick drops of rain are pouring down, the water flows down along the slope, so too, wherever the Blessed One will go now, the brahmin householders of town and country will incline in the same direction. For what reason? Because of the Blessed One's virtuous behavior and wisdom."

"Let me never come upon fame, Nāgita, and may fame never catch up with me. One who does not gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, this bliss of renunciation . . . might accept that vile pleasure, that slothful pleasure, the pleasure of gain, honor, and praise. [32]

(1) "Nāgita, what is eaten, drunk, consumed, and tasted winds up as feces and urine: this is its outcome. (2) From the change and alteration of things that are dear arise sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish: this is its outcome. (3) For one devoted to practicing meditation on the mark of unattractiveness, revulsion toward the mark of the beautiful becomes established: this is its outcome. (4) For one who dwells contemplating impermanence in the six bases for contact, revulsion toward contact becomes established: this is its outcome. (5) For one who dwells contemplating arising and vanishing in the
five aggregates subject to clinging, revulsion toward clinging becomes established: this is its outcome." [^999]

# IV. SuMANĀ

## 31 (1) Sumanā

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇ̣ika's Park. Then Princess Sumana, [^1000] accompanied by five hundred chariots and five hundred court girls, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side: Princess Sumana then said to the Blessed One:

"Here, Bhante, there might be two disciples of the Blessed One equal in faith, virtuous behavior, and wisdom, but one is generous while the other is not. With the breakup of the body, [33] after death, they would both be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. When they have become devas, would there be any distinction or difference between them?"

"There would be, Sumana," the Blessed One said. "The generous one, having become a deva, would surpass the other in five ways: in celestial life span, celestial beauty, celestial happiness, celestial glory, and celestial authority. The generous one, having become a deva, would surpass the other in these five ways."

"But, Bhante, if these two pass away from there and again become human beings, would there still be some distinction or difference between them?"

"There would be, Sumana," the Blessed One said. "When they again become human beings, the generous one would surpass the other in five ways: in human life span, human beauty, human happiness, human fame, and human authority. When they again become human beings, the generous one would surpass the other in these five ways."

"But, Bhante, if these two should go forth from the household life into homelessness, would there still be some distinction or difference between them?"

"There would be, Sumana," the Blessed One said. "The generous one, having gone forth, would surpass the other in five ways. [^1001] (1) He would usually use a robe that has been specifically offered to him, seldom one that had not been specifically
offered to him. (2) He would usually eat almsfood that has been specifically offered to him, seldom almsfood that had not been specifically offered to him. (3) He would usually use a lodging that had been specifically offered to him, seldom one that had not been specifically offered to him. (4) He would usually use medicines and provisions for the sick that had been specifically offered to him, seldom those that had not been specifically offered to him. (5) His fellow monastics, those with whom he dwells, would usually behave toward him in agreeable ways by bodily, verbal, and mental action, seldom in disagreeable ways. They would usually present him what is agreeable, seldom [34] what is disagreeable. The generous one, having gone forth, would surpass the other in these five ways."

"But, Bhante, if both attain arahantship, would there still be some distinction or difference between them after they have attained arahantship?"

"In this case, Sumanā, I declare, there would be no difference between the liberation [of one] and the liberation [of the other]."

"It's astounding and amazing, Bhante! Truly, one has good reason to give alms and do meritorious deeds, since they will be helpful if one becomes a deva, [again] becomes a human being, or goes forth."

"So it is, Sumanā! So it is, Sumanā! Truly, one has good reason to give alms and do meritorious deeds, since they will be helpful if one becomes a deva, [again] becomes a human being, or goes forth."

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:

"As the stainless moon

moving through the sphere of space

outshines with its radiance

all the stars in the world,

so one accomplished in virtuous behavior,

a person endowed with faith,

outshines by generosity

all the misers in the world.
"As the hundred-peaked rain cloud, thundering, wreathed in lightning, pours down rain upon the earth, inundating the plains and lowlands, so the Perfectly Enlightened One's disciple, the wise one accomplished in vision, surpasses the miserly person in five specific respects:

life span and glory, beauty and happiness. [^1002]

Possessed of wealth, after death he rejoices in heaven." [35]

# 32 (2) Cundi [^1003]

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. Then Princess Cundi, [^1004] accompanied by five hundred chariots and five hundred court girls, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Princess Cundi then said to the Blessed One:

"Bhante, my brother is Prince Cunda. He says thus: 'Whenever a man or a woman has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and abstains from the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from indulging in liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn only in a good destination, not in a bad destination.' I ask the Blessed One: 'What kind of teacher, Bhante, should one have confidence in, so that, with the breakup of the body, after death, one is reborn only in a good destination, not in a bad destination? What kind of Dhamma should one have confidence in, so that, with the breakup of the body, after death, one is reborn only in a good destination, not in a bad destination? What kind of Sangha should one have confidence in, so that, with the breakup of the body, after death, one is reborn only in a good destination, not in a bad destination? What kind of virtuous behavior should one fulfill so that, with the breakup of the body, after death, one is reborn only in a good destination, not in a bad destination?"
(1) "Cundi, to whatever extent there are beings, whether footless or with two feet, four feet, or many feet, whether having form or formless, whether percipient, non-percipient, or neither percipient nor non-percipient, the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One is declared the foremost among them. Those who have confidence in the Buddha have confidence in the foremost, and for those who have confidence in the foremost, the result is foremost.

(2) "To whatever extent, Cundī, there are phenomena that are conditioned, the noble eightfold path is declared the foremost among them. Those who have confidence in the noble eightfold path have confidence in the foremost, and for those who have confidence in the foremost, the result is foremost. [^1005]

(3) "To whatever extent, Cundī, there are phenomena whether conditioned or unconditioned, dispassion is declared the foremost among them, that is, the crushing of pride, the removal of thirst, the uprooting of attachment, the termination of the round, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, nibbāna. Those who [36] have confidence in the Dhamma, in dispassion, [^1006] have confidence in the foremost, and for those who have confidence in the foremost, the result is foremost.

(4) "To whatever extent, Cundī, there are Sanghas or groups, the Sangha of the Tathāgata's disciples is declared the foremost among them, that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals-this Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world. Those who have confidence in the Sangha have confidence in the foremost, and for those who have confidence in the foremost, the result is foremost.

(5) "To whatever extent, Cundī, there is virtuous behavior, the virtuous behavior loved by the noble ones is declared the foremost among them, that is, when it is unbroken, flawless, unblemished, unblotched, freeing, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading to concentration. Those who fulfill the virtuous behavior loved by the noble ones fulfill the foremost, and for those who fulfill the foremost, the result is foremost."

For those confident in regard to the foremost, [^1007] knowing the foremost Dhamma,
confident in the Buddha-the foremostunsurpassed, worthy of offerings;

for those confident in the foremost Dhamma, in the blissful peace of dispassion; for those confident in the foremost Sangha, the unsurpassed field of merit;

for those giving gifts to the foremost, the foremost kind of merit increases: the foremost life span, beauty, and glory, good reputation, happiness, and strength.

The wise one who gives to the foremost, concentrated upon the foremost Dhamma, having become a deva or human being, rejoices having attained the foremost.

# 33 (3) Uggaha

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Bhaddiya in the Jātiyā Grove. Then Uggaha, Mendaka's grandson, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down tc one side, and said to the Blessed One:

"Bhante, let the Blessed One together with three other monks [^1008] consent to accept tomorrow's [37] meal from me."

The Blessed One consented by silence. Then Uggaha, having understood that the Blessed One had consented, rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed.

Then, when the night had passed, in the morning the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and went to Uggaha's residence, where he sat down on the appointed seat. Then, with his own hands, Uggaha, Mendaka's grandson, served and satisfied the Blessed One with various kinds of delicious food.

When the Blessed One had finished eating and had put away his bowl, Uggaha sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, these girls of mine will be going to their husbands' families. Let the Blessed One exhort them and instruct them in a way that will lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time."

The Blessed One then said to those girls:

(1) "So then, girls, you should train yourselves thus: 'To whichever husband our parents give us-doing so out of a desire for our good, seeking our welfare, taking compassion on us, acting out of compassion for us-we will rise before him and retire after him, undertaking whatever needs to be done, agreeable in our conduct and pleasing in our speech.' Thus should you train yourselves.

(2) "And you should train yourselves thus: 'We will honor, respect, esteem, and venerate those whom our husband respects-his mother and father, ascetics and brahmins-and when they arrive we will offer them a seat and water.' Thus should you train yourselves.

(3) "And you should train yourselves thus: 'We will be skillful and diligent in attending to our husband's domestic chores, whether knitting or weaving; we will possess sound judgment about them in order to carry out and arrange them properly.' Thus should you train yourselves.

(4) "And you should train yourselves thus: 'We will find out what our husband's domestic helpers-whether slaves, messengers, or [38] workers-have done and left undone; we will find out the condition of those who are ill; and we will distribute to each an appropriate portion of food.' Thus should you train yourselves:

(5) "And you should train yourselves thus: 'We will guard and protect whatever income our husband brings homewhether money or grain, silver or gold-and we will not be spendthrifts; thieves, wastrels, or squanderers of his earnings.' Thus should you train yourselves.

"When, girls, a woman possesses these five qualities, with the breakup of the body, after death, she is reborn in companionship with the agreeable-bodied devas."1009

She does not despise her husband, the man who constantly supports her, who ardently and eagerly

always brings her whatever she wants.

Nor does a good woman scold her husband with speech caused by jealousy; [^1010]
the wise woman shows veneration to all those whom her husband reveres.

She rises early, works diligently, manages the domestic help; she treats her husband in agreeable ways and safeguards the wealth he earns.

The woman who fulfills her duties thus, following her husband's will and wishes, is reborn among the devas called "the agreeable ones."

# 34 (4) Stha

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then Sitha the general approached [39] the Blessed One, paid homage to him; sat down to one side, and said: [^1011]

"Is it possible, Bhante, to point out a directly visible fruit of giving?"1012

"It is, Sihá," the Blessed One said.

(1) "A donor, Sīha, a munificent giver, is dear and agreeable to many people. This is a directly visible fruit of giving.

(2) "Again, good persons resort to a donor, a munificent giver. This, too, is a directly visible fruit of giving.

(3) "Again, a donor, a munificent giver, acquires a good reputation. This, too, is a directly visible fruit of giving.

(4) "Again, whatever assembly a donor, a munificent giver, approaches-whether of khattiyas, brahmins, householders, or ascetics-he approaches it confidently and composed. [^1013] This too is a directly visible fruit of giving.

(5) "Again, with the breakup of the body, after death, a donor, a munificent giver, is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. This is a fruit of giving pertaining to future lives."1014

When this was said, Sīha the general said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, I do not go by faith in the Blessed One concerning those four directly visible fruits of giving declared by him. I know them, too. For I am a donor, a munificent giver, and I am dear and agreeable to many people. I am a donor, a munificent giver, and many good persons resort to me. I am a donor,
a munificent giver, and I have acquired a good reputation as a donor, sponsor, and supporter of the Sangha. I [40] am a donor, a munificent giver, and whatever assembly I approachwhether of khattiyas, brahmins, householders, or ascetics-I approach it confidently and composed. I do not go by faith in the Blessed One concerning these four directly visible fruits of giving declared by him. I know them, too. But when the Blessed One tells me: 'Sîha, with the breakup of the body, after death, a donor, a munificent giver, is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world,' I do not know this, and here I go by faith in the Blessed One."

"So it is, Siha, so it is! With the breakup of the body, after death, a donor, a munificent giver, is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world."

By giving, he becomes dear and many resort to him. He attains a good reputation and his fame increases. The generous man is composed and confidently enters the assembly.

Therefore, seeking happiness, wise persons give gifts, having removed the stain of miserliness. When they are settled in the triple heaven, for a long time they delight in companionship with the devas.

Having taken the opportunity to do wholesome deeds, passing from here, self-luminous, they roam in

Nandana, [^1015]

where they delight, rejoice, and enjoy themselves, furnished with the five objects of sensual pleasure.

Having fulfilled the word of the unattached Stable One, the Fortunate One's disciples rejoice in heaven. [41]

35 (5) The Benefits of Giving

"Bhikkhus, there are these five benefits of giving. What five? (1) One is dear and agreeable to many people. (2) Good persons resort to one. (3) One acquires a good reputation. (4) One is
not deficient in the layperson's duties. (5) With the breakup of the body, after death, one is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. These are the five benefits in giving."

By giving, one becomes dear, one follows the duty of the good; the good self-controlled monks always resort to one.

They teach one the Dhamma that dispels all suffering, having understood which the taintless one here attains nibbāna.

# 36 (6) Timely

"Bhikkhus, there are these five timely gifts. What five? (1) One gives a gift to a visitor. (2) One gives a gift to one setting out on a journey. (3) One gives a gift to a patient. (4) One gives a gift during a famine. (5) One first presents the newly harvested crops and fruits to the virtuous ones. These are the five timely gifts."

At the proper time, those wise, charitable, and generous folk give a timely gift to the noble ones, who are stable and upright; given with a clear mind, one's offering is vast.

Those who rejoice in such deeds or who provide [other] service do not miss out on the offering; they too partake of the merit.

Therefore, with a non-regressing mind, one should give a gift where it yields great fruit. Merits are the support of living beings [when they arise] in the other world. [42]

# 37 (7) Food

"Bhikkhus, a donor who gives food gives the recipients five things. What five? One gives life, beauty, happiness, strength, and discernment. [^1016] (1) Having given life, one partakes of life, whether celestial or human. (2) Having given beauty, one partakes of beauty, whether celestial or human. (3) Having given happiness, one partakes of happiness, whether celestial or human. (4) Having given strength, one partakes of strength, whether celestial or human. (5) Having given discernment, one partakes of discernment, whether celestial or human. A donor who gives food gives the recipients these five things."

The wise one is a giver of life, strength, beauty, and discernment.

The intelligent one is a donor of happiness and in turn acquires happiness.

Having given life, strength, beauty, happiness, and discernment, one is long-lived and famous wherever one is reborn.

## 38 (8) Faith

"Bhikkhus, these five benefits come to a clansman endowed with faith. What five? (1) When the good persons in the world show compassion, [^1017] they first show compassion to the person with faith, not so to the person without faith. (2) When they approach anyone, they first approach the person with faith, not so the person without faith. (3) When they receive alms, they first receive alms from the person with faith, not so from the person without faith. (4) When they teach the Dhamma, they first teach the Dhamma to the person with faith, not so to the person without faith. (5) With the breakup of the body, after death, a person with faith is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. These are the five benefits that come to a clansman who has faith.

"Just as at a crossroads on level ground, a great banyan tree becomes the resort for birds all around, so [43] the clansman endowed with faith becomes the resort for many people:
for bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, male lay followers, and female lay followers."

A large tree with a mighty trunk, branches, leaves, and fruit, firm roots, and bearing fruit, is a support for many birds.

Having flown across the sky, the birds resort to this delightful base: those in need of shade partake of its shade; those needing fruit enjoy its fruit.

Just so, when a person is virtuous, endowed with faith, of humble manner, compliant, gentle, welcoming, soft, those in the world who are fields of meritdevoid of lust and hatred, devoid of delusion, taintlessresort to such a person.

They teach him the Dhamma that dispels all suffering, having understood which the taintless one here attains nibbāna.

39 (9) Son

"Bhikkhus, considering five prospects, mother and father wish for a son to be born in their family. What five? (1) 'Having been supported by us, he will support us. (2) Or he will do work for us. (3) Our family lineage will be extended. (4) He will manage the inheritance, (5) or else, when we have passed on, he will give an offering on our behalf.' Considering these five prospects, mother and father wish for a son to be born in their family."

Considering the five prospects, wise people wish for a son.

"Supported by us, he will support us, or he will do work for us.

The family lineage will be extended, he will manage the inheritance, or else, when we have passed on, he will make an offering on our behalf."

Considering these prospects, wise people wish for a son.

Therefore good persons, grateful and appreciative, support their mother and father, recalling how they helped one in the past; [44] they do what is necessary for them as they did for oneself in the past.

Following their advice, nurturing those who brought him up, continuing the family lineage, endowed with faith, virtuous: this son is worthy of praise.

40 (10) Sal Trees [^1018]

"Bhikkhus, based on the Himalayas, the king of mountains, great sal trees grow in five ways. What five? (1) They grow in branches, leaves, and foliage; (2) they grow in bark; (3) they grow in shoots; (4) they grow in softwood; and (5) they grow in heartwoud. Based on the Himalayas, the king of mountains, great sal trees grow in these five ways.

"So too, when the head of the family [^1019] is endowed with faith, the people in the family who depend on him grow in five ways. What five? (1) They grow in faith; (2) they grow in virtuous behavior; (3) they grow in learning; (4) they grow in generosity; and (5) they grow in wisdom. When the head of a family is endowed with faith, the people in the family who depend on him grow in these five ways."

just as the trees that grow

in dependence on a rocky mountain

in a vast forest wilderness

might become great 'woodland lords,'
so, when the head of a family here possesses faith and virtue, his wife, children, and relatives all grow in dependence on him; so too his companions, his family circle, and those dependent on him.

Those possessed of discernment, seeing that virtuous man's good conduct, his generosity and good deeds, emulate his example.

Having lived here in accord with Dhamma, the path leading to a good destination, those who desire sensual pleasures rejoice, delighting in the deva world: [45]

# V. MuNDA THE KING

## 41 (1) Utilization

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Then the householder Anāthapindika approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Householder, there are these five utilizations of wealth. What five? [^1020]

(1) "Here, householder, with wealth acquired by energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained, the noble disciple makes himself happy and pleased and properly maintains himself in happiness; he makes his parents happy and pleased and properly maintains them in happiness; he makes his wife and children, his slaves, workers, and servants happy and pleased and properly maintains them in happiness. This is the first utilization of wealth.

(2) "Again, with wealthacquired by energetic striving... righteously gained, the noble disciple makes his friends and companions happy and pleased and properly maintains them in happiness. This is the second utilization of wealth.
(3) "Again, with wealth acquired by energetic striving ...righteously gained, the noble disciple makes provisions with his wealth against the losses that might arise because of fire or floods, kings or bandits or unloved heirs; he makes himself secure against them. This is the third utilization of wealth.

(4) "Again, with wealth acquired by energetic striving ...righteously gained, the noble disciple makes the five oblations: to relatives, guests, ancestors, the king, and the deities. This is the fourth utilization of wealth.

(5) "Again, with wealth acquired by energetic striving ... [46]...righteously gained, the noble disciple establishes an uplifting offering of alms-an offering that is heavenly, resulting in happiness, conducive to heaven-to those ascetics and brahmins who refrain from intoxication and heedlessness, who are settled in patience and mildness, who tame themselves, calm themselves, and train themselves for nibbāna. This is the fifth utilization of wealth.

"These, householder, are the five utilizations of wealth. Householder, if a noble disciple's wealth is exhausted when he has utilized it in these five ways, he thinks: 'I have utilized wealth in these five ways and my wealth is exhausted.' Thus he has no regret. But if a noble disciple's wealth increases when he has utilized it in these five ways, he thinks: 'I have utilized wealth in these five ways and my wealth has increased.' Thus, either way, he has no regret."

"I've enjoyed wealth, supported my dependents, and overcome adversities.

I have given an uplifting offering, and performed the five oblations. I have served the virtuous monks, the self-controlled celibate ones.

"I have achieved whatever purpose a wise person, dwelling at home, might have in desiring wealth; what I have done brings me no regret."

Recollecting this, a mortal remains firm in the noble Dhamma.

They praise him here in this life, and after death he rejoices in heaven.

# 42 (2) The Good Person

"Bhikkhus, when a good person is born in a family, it is for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people. It is for the good, welfare, and happiness of (1) his mother and father, (2) his wife and children, (3) his slaves, workers, and servants, (4) his friends and companions, and (5) ascetics and brahmins. Just as a great rain cloud, nurturing all the crops, appears for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people, so too, [47] when a good person is born in a family, it is for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people. It is for the good, welfare, and happiness of his mother and father... ascetics and brahmins."

The deities protect one guarded by the Dhamma, [^1021] who has managed his wealth for the welfare of many. Fame does not forsake one steadfast in the Dhamma, who is learned and of virtuous behavior and observances.

Who is fit to blame him, standing in Dhamma, accomplished in virtuous behavior, a speaker of truth, possessing a sense of shame, [pure] like a coin of refined gold?

Even the devas praise him;

by Brahmā, too, he is praised.

## 43 (3) Wished For

Then the householder Anathapiṇdika approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Householder, there are these five things that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world. What five? Long life, householder, is wished for, desired, agreeable, and
rarely gained in the world. Beauty . . . Happiness . . . Fame . . . The heavens are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world. These are the five things that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world. [^1022]

"These five things, householder, that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world, I say, are not obtained by means of prayers or aspirations. If these five things that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world could be obtained by means of prayers [48] or aspirations, who here would be lacking in anything?

(1) "Householder, the noble disciple who desires long life ought not to pray for long life or delight in it or [passively] yearn for it. [^1023] A noble disciple, who desires long life should practice the way conducive to long life. [^1024] For when he practices the way conducive to long life, it leads to obtaining long life, and he gains long life either celestial or human.

(2) "Householder, the noble disciple who desires beauty... (3) ... who desires happiness... (4) ... who desires fame ought not to pray for fame or delight in it or [passively] yearn for it. A noble disciple who desires fame should practice the way conducive to fame. For when he practices the way conducive to fame, it leads to obtaining fame, and he gains fame either celestial or human.

(5) "Householder, the noble disciple who desires the heavens ought not to pray for the heavens or delight in them or [passively] yearn for them. A noble disciple who desires the heavens should practice the way conducive to heaven. For when he practices the way conducive to heaven, it leads to obtaining the heavens, and he gains the heavens."1025

For one desiring long life, beauty, fame, [^1026]

acclaim, heaven, high families,

and lofty delights

following in succession,

the wise praise heedfulness

in doing deeds of merit. [49]

Being heedful, the wise person

secures both kinds of good:

the good in this' life,
and the good of the future life.

By attaining the good, [^1027] the steadfast one is called one of wisdom.

44 (4) The Giver of the Agreeable

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and went to the residence of the householder Ugga of Vesāli, where he sat down in the appointed seat. Then the householder Ugga of Vesāli approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to the Blessed One:

"Bhante, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learned this: 'The giver of what is agreeable gains what is agreeable.' Bhante, my sal flower porridge is agreeable. [^1028] Let the Blessed One accept it from me, out of compassion." The Blessed One accepted, out of compassion.

"Bhante, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learned this: 'The giver of what is agreeable gains what is agreeable.' Bhante, my pork embellished with jujubes is agreeable. [^1029] Let the Blessed One accept it from me, out of compassion." The Blessed One accepted, out of compassion.

"Bhante, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learned this: 'The giver of what is agreeable gains what is agreeable.' Bhante, my fried vegetable stalks are agreeable. [^1030] Let the Blessed One accept them from me, out of compassion." The Blessed One accepted, out of compassion.

"Bhante, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learned this: 'The giver of what is agreeable gains what is agreeable.' Bhante, my boiled hill rice cleared of dark grains, accompanied by various sauces and condiments, is agreeable. Let the Blessed One accept it from me, out of compassion." The Blessed One accepted, out of compassion. [50]

"Bhante, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learned this: 'The giver of what is agreeable gains what is agreeable.' Bhante, my cloths from Kāsi are agreeable. Let the Blessed One accept them from me, out of compassion." The Blessed One accepted, out of compassion.

"Bhante, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learned this: 'The giver of what is agreeable gains what is agreeable.'

Bhante, my couch spread with rugs, blankets, and covers, with an excellent covering of antelope hide, with a canopy above and red bolsters at both ends, is agreeable. Although I know this is not allowable for the Blessed One, this sandalwood plank of mine is worth over a thousand. [^1031] Let the Blessed One accept it from me, out of compassion." The Blessed One accepted, out of compassion.

Then the Blessed One expressed his appreciation to the householder Ugga of Vesālī thus:

"The giver of the agreeable gains the agreeable, when he gives willingly to the upright ones clothing, bedding, food, and drink, and various kinds of requisites.

"Having known the arahants to be like a field for what is relinquished and offered; not held back, [^1032] the good person gives what is hard to give: the giver of agreeable things gains what is agreeable."

Then, after expressing his appreciation to the householder Ugga of Vesālī, the Blessed One rose from his seat and left. Then, some time later, the householder Ugga of Vesālī passed away. After his death, the householder Ugga of Vesālī was reborn among a certain group of mind-made [deities]. [^1033] On that occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇ̣ika's Park. Then, when the night had advanced, the young deva Ugga, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire [51] Jeta's Grove, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. The Blessed One then said to him: "I hope, Ugga, that it is as you would have wished."

"Surely, Bhante, it is as I had wished."

Then the Blessed One addressed the young deva Ugga with verses:

"The giver of the agreeable gains the agreeable; the giver of the foremost again gains the foremost; the giver of the excellent gains the excellent; the giver of the best reaches the best state.
"The person who gives the best, the giver of the foremost, the giver of the excellent, is long-lived and famous wherever he is reborn." [^1034]

45 (5) Streams [^1035]

"Bhikkhus, there are these five streams of merit, streams of the wholesome, nutriments of happiness-heavenly, ripening in happiness, conducive to heaven-that lead to what is wished for, desired, and agreeable, to one's welfare and happiness. What five?

"(1) When a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a measureless concentration of mind while using a robe [that one has given him], one acquires a measureless stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, a nutriment of happiness . . . that leads . . . to one's welfare and happiness. (2) When a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a measureless concentration of mind while using almsfood [that one has given him], one acquires a measureless stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, a nutriment of happiness... that leads ... to one's welfare and happiness. (3) When a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a measureless concentration of mind while using a dwelling [that one has given him], one acquires a measureless stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, a nutriment of happiness . . . that leads . . . to one's welfare and happiness. (4) When a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a measureless concentration of mind while using a bed and chair [that one has given him], one acquires a measureless stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, a nutriment of happiness . . . that leads ... to one's welfare and happiness. (5) When a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a measureless concentration of mind while using medicines and provisions for the sick [that one has given him], [52] one acquires a measureless stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, a nutriment of happiness ... that leads to one's welfare and happiness.

"These are the five streams of merit, streams of the wholesome, nutriments of happiness-heavenly, ripening in happiness, conducive to heaven-that lead to what is wished for, desired, and agreeable, to one's welfare and happiness.
"When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple possesses these five streams of merit, streams of the wholesome, it is not easy to measure his merit thus: 'Just so much is his stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, nutriment of happiness-heavenly ... that leads to ... one's welfare and happiness'; rather, it is reckoned simply as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit.

"Bhikkhus, just as it is not easy to measure the water in the great ocean thus: 'There are so many gallons of water,' or 'There are so many hundreds of gallons of water,' or 'There are so many thousands of gallons of water, [^1036] or 'There are so many hundreds of thousands of gallons of water,' but rather it is reckoned simply as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of water; so too, when a noble disciple possesses these five streams of merit . . . it is reckoned simply as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit."

Just as the many rivers used by the hosts of people, flowing downstream, reach the ocean, the great mass of water, the boundless sea, the fearsome receptacle of heaps of gems; [53] so the streams of merit reach the wise man who is a giver of food, drink, and cloth; [they reach] the donor of beds, seats, and covers like rivers carrying their waters to the sea.

# 46 (6) Accomplishments

"Bhikkhus, there are these five accomplishments. What five? Accomplishment in faith, accomplishment in virtuous behavior, accomplishment in learning, accomplishment in generosity, and accomplishment in wisdom. These are the five accomplishments."

## 47 (7) Wealth

"Bhikkhus, there are these five kinds of wealth. What five? The wealth of faith, the wealth of virtuous behavior, the wealth of learning, the wealth of generosity, and the wealth of wisdom.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the wealth of faith? Here, a noble disciple is endowed with faith. He places faith in the enlight-
enment of the Tathāgata thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' This is called the wealth of faith.

(2) "And what is the wealth of virtuous behavior? Here, a noble disciple abstains from the destruction of life, abstains from taking what is not given, abstains from sexual misconduct, abstains from false speech, abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. This is called the wealth of virtuous behavior.

(3) "And what is the wealth of learning? Here, a noble disciple has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and accumulates what he has learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life-such teachings as these he has learned much of, retained in mind, recited verbally, mentally investigated, and penetrated well by view. [^1657].

(4) "And what is the wealth of generosity? Here, a noble disciple dwells at home with a heart devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in relinquishment, devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing. This is called the wealth of generosity.

(5) "And what is the wealth of wisdom? Here, a noble disciple is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. This is called the wealth of wisdom.

"These, bhikkhus, are the five kinds of wealth." [54]

When one has faith in the Tathāgata, [^1038] unshakable and well established, and virtuous behavior that is good; loved and praised by the noble ones; when one has confidence in the Sangha and one's view has been straightened out, they say that one is not poor, that one's life is not lived in vain.

Therefore an intelligent person, remembering the Buddhas' teaching, should be intent on faith and virtuous behavior, confidence and vision of the Dhamma.

# 48 (8) Situations

"Bhikkhus, there are these five situations that are unobtainable by an ascetic or a brahmin, by a deva, Māra, or Brahmā, or by anyone in the world. What five? (1) 'May what is subject to old age not grow old!': this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic or a brahmin, by a deva, Māra, or Brahmā; or by anyone in the world. (2) 'May what is subject to illness not fall ill!': this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic... or by anyone in the world. (3) 'May what is subject to death not die!': this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic... or by anyone in the world. (4) 'May what is subject to destruction not be destroyed!': this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic... or by anyone in the world. (5) 'May what is subject to loss not be lost!': this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic or a brahmin, by a deva, Māra, or Brahmā, or by anyone in the world.

(1) "Bhikkhus, for the uninstructed worldling, what is subject to old age grows old. When this happens, he does not reflect thus: 'I am not the only one for whom what is subject to old age grows old. For all beings that come and go, that pass away and undergo rebirth, what is subject to old age grows old. If I were to sorrow, languish, lament, weep beating my breast, and become confused when what is subject to old age grows old, I would lose my appetite and my features would become ugly. I would not be able to do my work, my enemies would be elated, and my friends would become saddened.' Thus, when what is subject to old age grows old, he sorrows, languishes, laments, weeps beating his breast, and becomes confused. This is called an uninstructed worldling pierced by the poisonous dart of sorrow who only torments himself.

(2) "Again, for the uninstructed worldling, [55] what is subject to illness falls ill... (3) ... what is subject to death dies... (4) ... what is subject to destruction is destroyed ... (5) ... what is subject to loss is lost. When this happens, he does not reflect thus: 'I am not the only one for whom what is subject to loss
is lost. For all beings who come and go, who pass away and undergo rebirth, what is subject to loss is lost. If I were to sorrow, languish, lament, weep beating my breast, and become confused when what is subject to loss is lost, I would lose my appetite and my features would become ugly. I would not be able to do my work, my enemies would be elated, and my friends would become saddened.' Thus, when what is subject to loss is lost, he sorrows, languishes, laments, weeps beating his breast, and becomes confused. This is called an uninstructed worldling pierced by the poisonous dart of sorrow who only torments himself.

(1) "Bhikkhus, for the instructed noble disciple, what is subject to old age grows old. When this happens, he reflects thus: 'I am not the only one for whom what is subject to old age grows old. For all beings that come and go, that pass away and undergo rebirth, what is subject to old age grows old. If I were to sorrow, languish, lament, weep beating my breast, and become confused when what is subject to old age grows old, I would lose my appetite and my features would become ugly. I would not be able to do my work, my enemies would be elated, and my friends would become saddened.' Thus, when what is subject to old age grows old, he does not sorrow, languish, lament, weep beating his breast; and become confused. This is called an instructed noble disciple who has drawn out the poisonous dart of sorrow pierced by which the uninstructed worldling only torments himself. Sorrowless, without darts, the noble disciple realizes nibbāna. [^1039]

(2) "Again, for the instructed noble disciple, what is subject to illness falls ill . . (3) . . . what is subject to death dies . . (4) . . . what is subject to destruction is destroyed . . (5) . . . what is subject to loss is lost. When this happens, he reflects thus: 'I am not the only one for whom what is subject to loss is lost. For all beings that come and go, that pass away and undergo rebirth, what is subject to loss [56] is lost. If I were to sorrow, languish, lament, weep beating my breast, and become confused when what is subject to loss is lost, I would lose my appetite and my features would become ugly. I would not be able to do my work, my enemies would be elated, and my friends would become saddened.' Thus, when what is subject to loss is lost, he does not sorrow, languish, lament, weep beating his breast, and become
confused. This is called an instructed noble disciple who has drawn out the poisonous dart of sorrow pierced by which the uninstructed worldling only torments himself. Sorrowless, without darts, the noble disciple realizes nibbāna.

"These, bhikkhus, are the five situations that are unobtainable by an ascetic or a brahmin, by a deva, Māra, or Brahmā, or by anyone in the world.

"It is not by sorrowing and lamenting that even the least good here can be gained. [^1040] Knowing that one is sorrowful and sad, one's enemies are elated.

"When the wise person does not shake in adversities, knowing how to determine what is good, his enemies are saddened, having seen that his former facial expression does not change.

"Wherever one might gain one's good, in whatever way-by chanting, mantras, maxims, gifts, or tradition [^1041]-there one should exert oneself in just that way.

"But if one should understand: 'This good cannot be obtained by me or anyone else,' one should accept the situation without sorrowing, thinking: 'The kamma is strong; what can I do now?"' [57]

# 49 (9) Kosala

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. [Now on that occasion Queen Mallikā had just died. [^1042] Then a man approached King Pasendi and whispered in his ear: "Sire, Queen Mallikā has just died." When this was said, King Pasenadi was pained and saddened, and he sat there with slumping shoulders, facing downward, glum, and speechless.

Then the Blessed One, having known the king's condition, said to him:
"Great king, there are these five situations that are unobtainable by an ascetic or a brahmin, by a deva, Māra, or Brahmā, or by anyone in the world."

[The rest of this sutta is identical with 5:48, including the verses.]

# 50 (10) Nārada

On one occasion the Venerable Nārada was dwelling at Pātaliputta at the Cock's Park. Now on that occasion King Munda's [wife] Queen Bhaddā, who had been dear and beloved to him, had died. Since her death, he did not bathe, anoint himself, eat his meals, or undertake his work. Day and night, he remained brooding over Queen Bhaddā's body. Then King Munda addressed his treasurer, Piyaka: "Well then, friend Piyaka, [58] immerse Queen Bhaddā's body in an iron vat filled with oil and enclose it in another iron vat so that we can see Queen Bhaddā's body still longer."

"Yes, sire," the treasurer Piyaka replied. Then he immersed Queen Bhaddā's body in an iron vat filled with oil and enclosed it in another iron vat.

Then it occurred to the treasurer Piyaka: "King Munda's [wife] Queen Bhaddā has died, and she was dear and beloved to him. Since her death, he does not bathe, anoint himself, eat his meals, or undertake his work. Day and night, he remains brooding over the queen's body. What ascetic or brahmin can King Munda visit, so that, having heard his Dhamma, he might abandon the dart of sorrow?"

Then it occurred to Piyaka: "The Venerable Nārada is dwelling at Pātaliputta, in the Cock's Park. Now a good report about this Venerable Nārada has circulated thus: 'He is wise, competent, intelligent, learned, an artful speaker, eloquent, mature, and an arahant.' Suppose King Munda would visit the Venerable Nārada: perhaps if he hears the Venerable Nārada's Dhamma, he would abandon the dart of sorrow."

Then the treasurer Piyaka approached King Munda and said to him: "Sire, the Venerable Nārada is dwelling at Pātaliputta, in the Cock's Park. Now a good report about this Venerable Nārada has circulated thus: 'He is wise . . . and an arahant.' Your majesty should visit the Venerable Nārada. Perhaps, when you hear the Venerable Nārada's Dhamma, you would abandon the
dart of sorrow." [The king said:] "Well then, friend Piyaka, [59] inform the Venerable Nārada. For how can one like me think of approaching an ascetic or brahmin living in his realm without first informing him?"

"Yes, sire," Piyaka replied. Then he went to the Venerable Nārada, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: "Bhante, King Munḍa's [wife] Queen Bhaddā, who was dear and beloved to him, has died. Since the queen's death, he does not bathe, anoint himself, eat his meals, or undertake his work: Day and night, he remains brooding over the queen's body. It would be good, Bhante, if the Venerable Nārada would teach the Dhamma to King Munḍa in such a way that he can abandon the dart of sorrow."

"Then let King Munḍa come at his own convenience."

Then the treasurer Piyaka rose from his seat, paid homage to the Venerable Nārada, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and went to King Munḍa. He told the king: "Sire, the Venerable Nārada has given his consent. You may go at your own convenience."

"Well then, friend Piyaka, get the finest carriages harnessed!"

"Yes, sire," Piyaka replied, and after he had gotten the finest carriages harnessed he told King Munḍa: "Sire, the finest carriages have been harnessed. You may go at your own convenience."

Then King Munḍa mounted a fine carriage, and along with the other carriages he set out in full royal splendor for the Cock's Park to see the Venerable Nārada. He went by carriage as far as the ground was suitable for a carriage, and then he dismounted from his carriage and entered the park on foot. He approached the Venerable Nārada, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. [60] The Venerable Nārada then said to him:

"Great king, there are these five situations that are unobtainable by an ascetic or a brahmin, by a deva, Māra, or Brahmā, or by anyone in the world. What five? (1) 'May what is subject to old age not grow old!': this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic or a brahmin, by a deva, Māra, or Brahmā, or by anyone in the world. (2) 'May what is subject to illness not fall ill!': this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic... or by anyone in the world. (3) 'May what is subject to death not die!': this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic... or
by anyone in the world. (4) 'May what is subject to destruction not be destroyed!': this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic... or by anyone in the world. (5) 'May what is subject to loss not be lost!': this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic or a brahmin, by a deva, Māra, or Brahmā, or by anyone in the world.

[The sequel is identical to 5:48, including the verses.] [61-62]

When this was said, King Munda asked the Venerable Nārada: "Bhante, what is the name of this exposition of the Dhamma?"

"Great king, this exposition of the Dhamma is named the extraction of the dart of sorrow." [^1043]

"Surely, Bhante, it is the extraction of the dart of sorrow! Surely, it is the extraction of the dart of sorrow! For having heard this exposition of the Dhamma, I have abandoned the dart of sorrow."

Then King Munḍa said to the treasurer Piyaka: "Well then, friend Piyaka, have Queen Bhaddā's body cremated and build a memorial mound for her. From today on, I will bathe and anoint myself and eat my meals and undertake my work." [63]

# The Second Fifty

## I. HINDRANCES

## 51 (1) Obstructions

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, there are these five obstructions, hindrances, encumbrances of the mind, states that weaken wisdom. What five? (1) Sensual desire is an obstruction, a hindrance, an encumbrance of the mind, a state that weakens wisdom. (2) Ill will... (3) Dullness and drowsiness ... (4) Restlessness and remorse ... (5) Doubt is an obstruction, a hindrance, an encumbrance of
the mind, a state that weakens wisdom. These are the five obstructions, hindrances, encumbrances of the mind, states that weaken wisdom.

"Bhikkhus, without having abandoned these five obstructions, hindrances, encumbrances of the mind, states that weaken wisdom, it is impossible that a bhikkhu, with his powerless and feeble wisdom, might know his own good, the good of others, [64] or the good of both; or realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. Suppose a river were flowing down from a mountain, traveling a long distance, with a swift current, carrying along much flotsam. Then, on both of its banks, a man would open irrigation channels. [^1044] In such a case, the current in the middle of the river would be dispersed, spread out, and divided, so that the river would no longer travel a long distance, with a swift current, carrying along much flotsam. So too, without having abandoned these five obstructions . . . it is impossible that a bhikkhu . . . might realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.

"But, bhikkhus, having abandoned these five obstructions, hindrances, encumbrances of the mind, states that weaken wisdom, it is possible that a bhikkhu, with his powerful wisdom, might know his own good, the good of others, and the good of both, and realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. Suppose a river were flowing down from a mountain, traveling a long distance, with a swift current, carrying along much flotsam. Then a man would close up the irrigation channels on both of its banks. In such a case, the current in the middle of the river would not be dispersed, spread out, and divided, so that the river could travel a long distance, with a swift current, carrying along much flotsam. So too, having abandoned these five obstructions . . . it is possible that a bhikkhu . . . might realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones." [65]

# 52 (2) A Heap

"Bhikkhus, saying 'a heap of the unwholesome,' it is about the five hindrances that one could rightly say this. [^1045] For the five hindrances are a complete heap of the unwholesome. What five? The hindrance of sensual desire, the hindrance of ill will, the
hindrance of dullness and drowsiness, the hindrance of restlessness and remorse, and the hindrance of doubt. Bhikkhus, saying 'a heap of the unwholesome,' it is about these five hindrances that one could rightly say this. For these five hindrances are a complete heap of the unwholesome."

# 53 (3) Factors

"Bhikkhus, there are these five factors that assist striving. What five?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is endowed with faith. He places faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.'

(2) "He is seldom ill or afflicted, possessing an even digestion that is neither too cool nor too hot but moderate and suitable for striving.

(3) "He is honest and open, one who reveals himself as he really is to the Teacher and his wise fellow monks.

(4) "He has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities.

(5) "He is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering.

"These, bhikkhus, are the five factors that assist striving."

## 54 (4) Occasions

"Bhikkhus, there are these five unfavorable occasions for striving. What five? [66]

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is old, overcome by old age. This is the first unfavorable occasion for striving.

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu is ill, overcome by illness. This is the second unfavorable occasion for striving.

(3) "Again, there is a famine, a poor harvest, a time when almsfood is difficult to obtain and it is not easy to subsist by means of gleaning. [^1046] This is the third unfavorable occasion for striving.
(4) "Again, there is peril, turbulence in the wilderness, and the people of the countryside, mounted on their vehicles, flee on all sides. This is the fourth unfavorable occasion for striving.

(5) "Again, there is a schism in the Sangha, and when there is a schism in the Sangha there are mutual insults, mutual reviling, mutual disparagement, and mutual rejection. [^1047] Then those without confidence do not gain confidence, while some of those with confidence change their minds. This is the fifth unfavorable occasion for striving.

"These are the five unfavorable occasions for striving.

"There are, bhikkhus, these five favorable occasions for striving. What five?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is young, a black-haired young man endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life. This is the first favorable occasion for striving.

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu is seldom ill or afflicted, possessing an even digestion that is neither too cool nor too hot but moderate and suitable for striving. This is the second favorable occasion for striving.

(3) "Again, food is plentiful; there has been a good harvest [67] and almsfood is abundant, so that one can easily sustain oneself by means of gleaning. This is the third favorable occasion for striving.

(4) "Again, people are dwelling in concord, harmoniously, without disputes, blending like milk and water, viewing each other with eyes of affection. This is the fourth favorable occasion for striving.

(5) "Again, the Sangha is dwelling at ease-in concord, harmoniously, without disputes, with a single recitation. When the Sangha is in concord, there are no mutual insults, no mutual reviling, no mutual disparagement, and no mutual rejection. Then those without confidence gain confidence and those with confidence increase [in their confidence]. [^1048] This is the fifth favorable occasion for striving.

"These are the five favorable occasions for striving."

# 55 (5) Mother and Son

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Now on that occasion a mother and a son, being respectively a bhikkhiunī and a bhikkhu, had entered the rains residence at Sāvatthī. They often
wanted to see one another, the mother often wanting to see her son, and the son his mother. Because they often saw one another, a bond was formed; because a bond formed, intimacy arose; because there was intimacy, lust found an opening. [^1049] With their minds in the grip of lust, without having given up the training and declared their weakness, they engaged in sexual intercourse. [^1050]

Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and reported what had happened: [68] [The Blessed One said:]

"Bhikkhus, did that foolish man think: 'A mother does not fall in love with her son, or a son with his mother'? (1) Bhikkhus, I do not see even one other form that is as tantalizing, sensuous, intoxicating, captivating, infatuating; and as much of an obstacle to achieving the unsurpassed security from bondage as the form of a woman. Beings who are lustful for the form of a woman-ravenous, tied to it, infatuated, and blindly absorbed in it [^1051]-sorrow for a long time under the control of a woman's form. (2) I do not see even one other sound... (3) ... even one other odor... (4) ... even one other taste ... (5) ... even one other touch that is as tantalizing, sensuous, intoxicating, captivating, infatuating, and as much of an obstacle to achieving the unsurpassed security from bondage as the touch of a woman. Beings who are lustful for the touch of a woman-ravenous, tied to it, infatuated, and blindly absorbed in it-sorrow for a long time under the control of a woman's touch.

"Bhikkhus, while walking, a woman obsesses the mind of a man; while standing... while sitting... while lying down... while laughing... while speaking... while singing... while crying a woman obsesses the mind of a man. When swollen, [^1052] too, a woman obsesses the mind of a man. Even when dead, a woman obsesses the mind of a man. If, bhikkhus, one could rightly say of anything: 'Entirely a snare of Māra,' it is precisely of women that one could say this. [^1053] [69]

One might talk with a murderous foe, one might talk with an evil spirit, one might even approach a viper whose bite means certain death; but with a woman, one to one, one should never talk.

They bind one whose mind is muddled with a glance and a smile, with their dress in disarray, and with gentle speech.

It is not safe to approach [^1054] such a person though she is swollen and dead.

These five objects of sensual pleasure are seen in a woman's body: forms, sounds, tastes, and odors, and also delightful touches.

Those swept up by the flood of sensuality, who do not fully uriderstand sense pleasures, are plunged headlong into samsāra, [into] time, destination, and existence upon existence. [^1055]

But those who have fully understood sense pleasures live without fear from any quarter.

Having attained the destruction of the taints, while in the world, they have gone beyond.

56 (6) Preceptor

Then a certain bhikkhu approached his own preceptor and said to him: "Bhante, my body now seems as if it has been drugged, I have become disoriented, and the teachings are no longer clear to me. Dullness and drowsiness obsess my mind. I live the spiritual life dissatisfied and have doubt about the teachings."1056

Then the preceptor took his pupil to the Blessed One. He paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side, and told the Blessed One what his pupil had said. [70] [The Blessed One said:]

"So it is, bhikkhu! (1) When one is unguarded in the doors of the sense faculties, (2) immoderate in eating, (3) and not intent on wakefulness; (4) when one lacks insight into wholesome qualities (5) and does not dwell intent on the endeavor to develop the aids to enlightenment in the earlier and later phases of the night, one's body seems as if it had been drugged, one becomes disoriented, and the teachings are no longer clear to
one. Dullness and drowsiness obsess one's mind. One lives the spiritual life dissatisfied and has doubt about the teachings.

"Therefore, bhikkhu, you should train yourself thus: (1) 'I will be guarded in the doors of the sense faculties, (2) moderate in eating, (3) and intent on wakefulness; (4) I will have insight into wholesome qualities (5) and will dwell intent on the endeavor to develop the aids to enlightenment in the earlier and later phases of the night.' It is in such a way, bhikkhu, that you should train yourself."

Then, having received such an exhortation from the Blessed One, that bhikkhu rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed. Then, dwelling alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute, in no long time that bhikkhu realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having entered upon it, he dwelled in it. He directly knew: "Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being." And that bhikkhu became one of the arahants.

Then, after attaining arahantship, that bhikkhu approached his preceptor and said to him: "Bhante, my body now no longer seems as if it had been drugged, I have become well oriented, and the teachings are clear to me. Dullness and drowsiness do not obsess my mind. I live the spiritual life joyfully and have no doubt about the teachings."

Then the preceptor took his pupil to the Blessed One. [71] He paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side, and told the Blessed One what his pupil had said. [The Blessed One said:]

"So it is, bhikkhu! When one is guarded in the doors of the sense faculties, moderate in eating, and intent on wakefulness; when one has insight into wholesome qualities and dwells intent on the endeavor to develop the aids to enlightenment in the earlier and later phases of the night, one's body does not seem as if it had been drugged, one becomes well oriented, and the teachings are clear to one. Dullness and drowsiness do not obsess one's mind. One lives the spiritual life joyfully and has no doubt about the teachings.
"Therefore, bhikkhus, [^1057] you should train yourselves thus: (1) 'We will be guarded in the doors of the sense faculties, (2) moderate in eating, and (3) intent on wakefulness; (4) we will have insight into wholesome qualities (5) and will dwell intent on the endeavor to develop the aids to enlightenment in the earlier and later phases of the night.' It is in such a way, bhikkhus, that you should train yourselves."

# 57 (7) Themes

"Bhikkhus, there are these five themes that should often be reflected upon by a woman or a man, by a householder or one gone forth. [^1058] What five? (1) A woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: 'I am subject to old age; I am not exempt from old age.' (2) A woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: 'I am subject to illness; I am not exempt from illness.' (3) A woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: 'I am subject to death; I am not exempt from death.' (4) A woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect [72] thus: 'I must be parted and separated from everyone and everything dear and agreeable to me. [^1059] (5) A woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: 'I am the owner of my kamma, the heir of my kamma; I have kamma as my origin, kamma as my relative, kamma as my resort; I will be the heir of whatever kamma, good or bad, that I do.'

(1) "For the sake of what benefit should a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, often reflect thus: 'I am subject to old age; I am not exempt from old age'? In their youth beings are intoxicated with their youth, and when they are intoxicated with their youth they engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when one often reflects upon this theme, the intoxication with youth is either completely abandoned or diminished. It is for the sake of this benefit that a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: 'I am subject to old age; I am not exempt from old age.'

(2) "And for the sake of what benefit should a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, often reflect thus: 'I am subject to illness; I am not exempt from illness'? In a state of
health beings are intoxicated with their health, and when they are intoxicated with their health they engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when one often reflects upon this theme, the intoxication with health is either completely abandoned or diminished. It is for the sake of this benefit that a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: 'I am subject to illness; I am not exempt from illness.'

(3) "And for the sake of what benefit should a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, often reflect thus: 'I am subject to death; I am not exempt from death'? During their lives beings are intoxicated with life, and when they are intoxicated with life they engage in misconduct by body, speech, [73] and mind. But when one often reflects upon this theme, the intoxication with life is either completely abandoned or diminished. It is for the sake of this benefit that a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: 'I am subject to death; I am not exempt from death.'

(4) "And for the sake of what benefit should a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, often reflect thus: 'I must be parted and separated from everyone and everything dear and agreeable to me'? Beings have desire and lust in regard to those people and things that are dear and agreeable, and excited by this lust, they engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when one often reflects upon this theme, the desire and lust in regard to everyone and everything dear and agreeable is either completely abandoned or diminished. It is for the sake of this benefit that a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: 'I must be parted and separated from everyone and everything dear and agreeable to me.'

(5) "And for the sake of what benefit should a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, often reflect thus: 'I am the owner of my kamma, the heir of my kamma; I have kamma as my origin, kamma as my relative, kamma as my resort; I will be the heir of whatever kamma, good or bad, that I do'? People engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when one often reflects upon this theme, such misconduct is either completely abandoned or diminished. It is for the sake of this benefit that a woman or a man, a householder or one gone
forth, should often reflect thus: 'I am the owner of my kamma, the heir of my kamma; I have kamma as my origin, kamma as my relative, kamma as my resort; I will be the heir of whatever kamma, good or bad, that I do.'

(1) "This noble disciple reflects thus: [74] 'I am not the only one who is subject to old age, not exempt from old age. All beings that come and go, that pass away and undergo rebirth, are subject to old age; none are exempt from old age.' As he often reflects on this theme, the path is generated. He pursues this path, develops it, and cultivates it. As he does so, the fetters are entirely abandoned and the underlying tendencies are uprooted. [^1060]

(2) "This noble disciple reflects thus: 'I am not the only one who is subject to illness, not exempt from illness. All beings that come and go, that pass away and undergo rebirth, are subject to illness; none are exempt from illness.' As he often reflects on this theme, the path is generated. He pursues this path, develops it, and cultivates it. As he does so, the fetters are entirely abandoned and the underlying tendencies are uprooted.

All beings that come and go, that pass
away and undergo rebirth, are owners of their kamma, heirs of their kamma; all have kamma as their origin, kamma as their relative, kamma as their resort; all will be heirs of whatever kamma, good or bad, that they do.' [75] As he often reflects on this theme, the path is generated. He pursues this path, develops it, and cultivates it. As he does so, the fetters are entirely abandoned and the underlying tendencies are uprooted.

"Worldlings subject to illness, [^1061]

old age, and death are disgusted

[by other people] who exist

in accordance with their nature.

"If I were to become disgusted with beings who have such a nature, that would not be proper for me since I too have the same nature.

"While I was dwelling thus, having known the state without acquisitions, I overcame all intoxications intoxication with health, with youth, and with lifenaving seen security in renunciation. [^1062]

"Zeal then arose in me as I clearly saw nibbāna.

Now I am incapable

of indulging in sensual pleasures.

Relying on the spiritual life, never will I turn back."

# 58 (8) Licchavi Youths

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Vesālī for alms: Having walked for alms in Vesālī, after the meal, when he had returned from his alms round, he entered the Great Wood and sat down at the foot of a tree to dwell for the day.

Now on that occasion a number of Licchavi youths had taken their strung bows and were walking and wandering in the Great Wood, accompanied by a pack of dogs, when they saw the Blessed One seated at the foot of a tree to dwell for the day. When they saw him, they put down their strung bows, sent the dogs off to one side, and approached him. They paid homage to the Blessed One [76] and silently stood in attendance upon him with their hands joined in reverential salutation.

Now on that occasion the Licchavi youth Mahānāma was walking and wandering for exercise in the Great Wood when he saw the Licchavi youths silently standing in attendance upon the Blessed One with their hands joined in reverential salutation. He then approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and uttered this inspired utterance: "They will be Vajjis! They will be Vajjis!"

[The Blessed One said:] "But why, Mahānāma, do you say: 'They will be Vajjis! They will be Vajjis!'?"

"These Licchavi youths, Bhante, are violent, rough, and brash. They are always plundering any sweets that are left as gifts among families, whether sugar cane, jujube fruits, cakes, pies, or sugarballs, and then they devour them. They give women and girls of respectable families blows on their backs. [^1063] Now they are standing silently in attendance upon the Blessed One with their hands joined in reverential salutation."

"Mahānāma, in whatever clansman five qualities are foundwhether he is a consecrated khattiya king, a country gentleman, the general of an army, a village headman, a guildmaster, or one of those who exercise private rulership over various clansonly growth is to be expected, not decline. What five?

(1) "Here, Mahānāma, with wealth acquired by energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained, a clansman honors, respects, esteems, [77] and venerates his parents. His parents, being honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, have compassion on him with a good heart, thinking: 'May you live long and maintain a long life span.' When a clansman's parents have compassion for him, only growth is to be expected for him, not decline.

(2) "Again, Mahānāma, with wealth acquired by energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the
sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained, a clansman honors, respects, esteems, and venerates his wife and children, his slaves, workers, and servants. Being honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, they have compassion on him with a good heart, thinking: 'May you live long!' When a clansman's wife and children, slaves, workers, and servants have compassion for him, only growth is to be expected for him, not decline.

(3) "Again, Mahānāma, with wealth acquired by energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained, a clansman honors, respects, esteems, and venerates the owners of the neighboring fields and those with whom he does business. [^1064] Being honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, they have compassion on him with a good heart, thinking: 'May you live long!' When the owners of the neighboring fields and those with whom he does business have compassion for a clansman, only growth is to be expected for him, not decline.

(4) "Again, Mahānāma, with wealth acquired by energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the. sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained, a clansman honors, respects, esteems, and venerates the oblational deities. [^1065] Being honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, they have compassion on him with a good heart, thinking: 'May you live long!' When the oblational deities have compassion for a clansman, only growth is to be expected for him, not decline.

(5) "Again, Mahānāma, with wealth acquired by energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteously gained, a clansman honors, respects, esteems, and venerates ascetics and brahmins. Being honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, they have compassion on him with a good heart, thinking: 'May you live long!' When ascetics and brahmins have compassion [78] for a clansman, only growth is to be expected for him, not decline.

"Mahānāma, in whatever clansman these five qualities are found-whether he is a consecrated khattiya king, a country gentleman, the general of an army, a village headman, a guildmaster, or one of those who exercise private rulership over various clans-only growth is to be expected, not decline."

He always does his duty toward his parents;

he promotes the welfare of his wife and children.

He takes care of the people in his home and those who live in dependence on him.

The wise person, charitable and virtuous, acts for the good of both kinds of relatives, those who have passed away and those still living in this world.

[He benefits] ascetics and brahmins, and [also] the deities;

he is one who gives rise to joy while living a righteous life at home.

Having done what is good, he is worthy of veneration and praise.

They praise him here in this world and after death he rejoices in heaven.

59 (9) Gone Forth in Old Age (1)

"Bhikkhus, it is rare to find one gone forth in old age who possesses five qualities. What five? It is rare to find one gone forth in old age (1) who is astute; (2) who has the proper manner; (3) who is learned; (4) who can speak on the Dhamma; and (5) who is an expert on the discipline. It is rare to find one gone forth in old age who possesses these five qualities."

60 (10) Gone Forth in Old Age (2)

"Bhikkhus, it is rare to find one gone forth in old age who possesses five qualities. What five? It is rare to find one gone forth in old age (1) who is easy to correct; [79] (2) who firmly retains in mind what he has learned; (3) who accepts instruction respectfully; (4) who can speak on the Dhamma; and (5) who is an expert on the discipline. It is rare to find one gone forth in old age who possesses these five qualities."

# II. Perceptions

61 (1) Perceptions (1).

"Bhikkhus, these five perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are of great fruit and benefit, culminating in the deathless, having the deathless as their consummation. What five? The perception of unattractiveness, the perception of death, the perception of danger, the perception of the repulsiveness of food, and the perception of non-delight in the entire world. [^1066] These five perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are of great fruit and benefit, culminating in the deathless, having the deathless as their consummation."

63 (3) Growth (1).

"Bhikkhus, growing in five ways, a male noble disciple grows by a noble growth, and he absorbs the essence and the best of this life. What five? He grows in faith, virtuous behavior, learning, generosity, and wisdom. Growing in these five ways, a male noble disciple grows by a noble growth, and he absorbs the essence and the best of this life."

He who grows in faith and virtuous behavior, in wisdom, generosity, and learning-

64 (4) Growth (2)

"Bhikkhus, growing in five ways, a female noble disciple grows by a noble growth, and she absorbs the essence and the best of
this life. What five? She grows in faith, virtuous behavior, learning, generosity, and wisdom. Growing in these five ways, a female noble disciple grows by a noble growth, and she absorbs the essence and the best of this life."

She who grows in faith and virtuous behavior, in wisdom, generosity, and learningsuch a virtuous female lay follower absorbs for herself the essence of this life. [81]

# 65 (5) Discussion

"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu possesses five qualities, it is fitting for his fellow monks to hold a discussion with him. What five?

"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu possesses five qualities, it is fitting for his fellow monks to live together with him. [^1058] What five? (1) Here, a bhikkhu is himself accomplished in virtuous behavior, and he answers questions posed during a discussion on accomplishment in virtuous behavior. (2) He is himself accomplished in concentration, and he answers questions posed during a discussion on accomplishment in concentration. (3) He is himself accomplished in wisdom, and he answers questions posed during a discussion on accomplishment in wisdom.

67 (7) Bases for Psychic Potency (1)

"Bhikkhus, when any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī develops and cultivates five things, one of two fruits is to be expected: [82] either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue remaining, the state of non-returning. What five?

"(1) Here, a bhikkhu develops the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to desire and activities of striving. (2) He develops the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to energy and activities of striving. (3) He develops the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to mind and activities of striving. (4) He develops the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to investigation and activities of striving. [^1669] (5) Enthusiasm itself is the fifth. [^1670]

"When, bhikkhus, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī develops and cultivates these five things, one of two fruits is to be expected: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue remaining, the state of non-returning."

68 (8) Bases for Psychic Potency (2)

"Bhikkhus, before my enlightenment, while I was just a bodhisatta, not yet fully enlightened, I developed and cultivated five things. What five?

"(1) I developed the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to desire and activities of striving. (2) I developed the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to energy and activities of striving. (3) I developed the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to mind and activities of striving. (4) I developed the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to investigation and activities of striving. (5) Enthusiasm itself was the fifth.

"Because I had developed and cultivated these things with enthusiasm as the fifth, there being a suitable basis, I was capable of realizing any state realizable by direct knowledge toward which I inclined my mind.

"If I wished: 'May I wield the various kinds of psychic potency:
having been one, may I become many ... [as in 5:23]... may I exercise mastery with the body as far as the brahmā world,' I was capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis... [as in 5:23]...

"If I wished: [83] 'May I, with the destruction of the taints, in this very life realize for myself with direct knowledge the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, may I dwell in it,' I was capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis."

69 (9) Disenchantment

"Bhikkhus, these five things, when developed and cultivated, lead exclusively to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to nibbāna. What five? Here, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the unattractiveness of the body, perceiving the repulsiveness of food, perceiving non-delight in the entire world, contemplating impermanence in all conditioned phenomena; and he has the perception of death well established internally. These five things, when developed and cultivated, lead exclusively to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to nibbāna."

70 (10) Destruction of the Taints

"Bhikkhus, these five things, when developed and cultivated, lead to the destruction of the taints. What five?

These five things, when developed and cultivated, lead to the destruction of the taints." [84]

# III. Future Perils

71 (1) Liberation of Mind (1)

"Bhikkhus, these five things, when developed and cultivated, have liberation of mind as their fruit, liberation of mind as their fruit and benefit; they have liberation by wisdom as their fruit, liberation by wisdom as their fruit and benefit. [^1071] What five?

Here, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the unattractiveness of the body, perceiving the repulsiveness of food, perceiving nondelight in the entire world, contemplating impermanence in all conditioned phenomena; and he has the perception of death well established internally. These five things, when developed and cultivated, have liberation of mind as their fruit, liberation of mind as their fruit and benefit; they have liberation by wisdom as their fruit, liberation by wisdom as their fruit and benefit.

"When a bhikkhu is liberated in mind and liberated by wisdom, he is called a bhikkhu who has removed the crossbar, filled in the moat, pulled out the pillar, a boltless one, a noble one with banner lowered, with burden dropped, detached. [^1072]

"And how has a bhikkhu removed the crossbar? Here, a bhikkhu has abandoned ignorance, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has removed the crossbar.

"And how has a bhikkhu filled in the moat? Here, a bhikkhu has abandoned the wandering on in birth that brings renewed existence; he has cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has filled in the moat.

"And how has a bhikkhú pulled out the pillar? [85] Here, a bhikkhu has abandoned craving, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has pulled out the pillar.

"And how is a bhikkhu a boltless one? Here, a bhikkhu has abandoned the five lower fetters, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so that they are no more subject to future arising. It is in this way that a bhikkhu is a boltless one.

"And how is a bhikkhú a noble one with banner lowered, with burden dropped, detached? Here, a bhikkhu has abandoned the conceit 'I am,' cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising. It is in this way that a bhikkhu is a noble one with banner lowered, with burden dropped, detached."

72 (2) Liberation of Mind (2)

"Bhikkhus, these five things, when developed and cultivated, have liberation of mind as their fruit, liberation of mind as their fruit and benefit; they have liberation by wisdom as their fruit, liberation by wisdom as their fruit and benefit. What five? The perception of impermanence, the perception of suffering in the impermanent, the perception of non-self in what is suffering, the perception of abandoning, the perception of dispassion. [^1073] These five things, when developed and cultivated, have liberation of mind as their fruit, liberation of mind as their fruit and benefit; they have liberation by wisdom as their fruit, liberation by wisdom as their fruit and benefit.

"When a bhikkhu is liberated in mind and liberated by wisdom, he is called a bhikkhu who has removed the crossbar, filled in the moat, pulled out the pillar, a boltless one, a noble one with bänner lowered, with burden dropped, detached.

"And how is a bhikkhu one who has removed the crossbar? ... [all as in 5:71, down:] [86]... It is in this way that a bhikkhu is a noble one with banner lowered, with burden dropped, detached."

# 73 (3) One Who Dovells in the Dhamma (1)

Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:

"It is said, Bhante, 'one who dwells in the Dhamma, one who dwells in the Dhamma. [^1074] In what way is a bhikkhu one who dwells in the Dhamma?"

(1) "Here, bhikkhu, a bhikkhu learns the Dhamma: the discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts, and questions-and-answers. He passes the day in learning the Dhamma but neglects seclusion and does not devote himself to internal serenity of mind. This is called a bhikkhu who is absorbed in learning, not one who dwells in the Dhamma. [87]

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu teaches the Dhamma to others in detail as he has heard and learned it. He passes the day communicating the Dhamma [^1075] but neglects seclusion and does not devote himself to internal serenity of mind. This is called a bhikkhu who is absorbed in communication, not one who dwells in the Dhamma.

(3) "Again, a bhikkhu recites the Dhámma in detail as he
has heard it and learned it. He passes the day in recitation but neglects seclusion and does not devote himself to internal serenity of mind. This is called a bhikkhu who is absorbed in recitation, not one who dwells in the Dhamma.

(4) "Again, a bhikkhu ponders, examines, and mentally inspects the Dhamma as he has heard it and learned it. He passes the day in thinking about the Dhamma but neglects seclusion and does not devote himself to internal serenity of mind. This is called a bhikkhu who is absorbed in thought, not one who dwells in the Dhamma.

(5) "Here, a bhikkhu learns the Dhamma-the discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts, and questions-and-answers-but he does not pass the day [solely] in learning the Dhamma. He does not neglect seclusion but devotes himself to internal serenity of mind. [^1076] It is in this way that a bhikkhu is one who dwells in the Dhamma.

"Thus, bhikkhu, I have taught the one absorbed in learning, the one absorbed in communication, the one absorbed in recitation, the one absorbed in thought, and the one who dwells in the Dhamma. Whatever should be done by a compassionate teacher out of compassion for his disciples, seeking their welfare, that I have done for you. These are the feet of trees, these are empty huts. Meditate, bhikkhu, do not be heedless. Do not have cause to regret it later. This is our instruction to you." [88]

# 74 (4) One Who Dwells in the Dhamma (2)

Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:

"It is said, Bhante, 'one who dwells in the Dhamma, one who dwells in the Dhamma.' In what way is a bhikkhu one who dwells in the Dhamma?"

(1) "Here, bhikkhu, a bhikkhu learns the Dhamma-the discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts, and questions-and-answers-but he does not go further and understand its meaning with wisdom. [^1077] This is called a bhikkhu who is absorbed in learning, not one who dwells in the Dhamma.

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu teaches the Dhamma to others in detail as he has heard and learned it, but he does not go further and understand its meaning with wisdom. This is called a bhikkhu
who is absorbed in communication, not one who dwells in the Dhamma.

(3) "Again, a bhikkhu recites the Dhamma in detail as he has heard it and learned it, but he does not go further and understand its meaning with wisdom. This is called a bhikkhu who is absorbed in recitation, not one who dwells in the Dhamma.

(4) "Again, a bhikkhu ponders, examines, and mentally inspects the Dhamma as he has heard it and learned it, but he does not go further and understand its meaning with wisdom. This is called a bhikkhu who is absorbed in thought, not one who dwells in the Dhamma.

(5) "Here, a bhikkhu learns the Dhamma-the discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts, and questions-and-answers-but he goes further and understands its meaning with wisdom. It is in this way that a bhikkhu is one who dwells in the Dhamma.

"Thus, bhikkhu, I have taught the one absorbed in learning, [89] the one absorbed in communication, the one absorbed in recitation, the one absorbed in thought, and the one who dwells in the Dhamma. Whatever should be done by a compassionate teacher out of compassion for his disciples, seeking their welfare, that I have done for you. These are the feet of trees, these are empty huts. Meditate, bhikkhu, do not be heedless. Do not have cause to regret it later. This is our instruction to you."

# 75 (5) Warriors (1)

"Bhikkhus, there are these five kinds of warriors found in the world. What five?

(1) "Here, some warrior, when he sees the cloud of dust, [^1078] sinks, founders, does not brace himself, and cannot enter the battle. There is, bhikkhus, such a warrior here. This is the first kind of warrior found in the world.

(2) "Again, some warrior can endure the cloud of dust, but when he sees the crests of the standards, he sinks, founders, does not brace himself, and cannot enter the battle. There is, bhikkhus, such a warrior here. This is the second kind of warrior found in the world.

(3) "Again, some warrior can endure the cloud of dust and the crests of the standards, but when he hears the uproar, he
sinks, founders, does not brace himself, and cannot enter the battle. There is, bhikkhus, such a warrior here. This is the third kind of warrior found in the world.

(4) "Again, some warrior can endure the cloud of dust, the crests of the standards, and the uproar, but he is struck down and wounded by blows. There is, bhikkhus, such a warrior here. This is the fourth kind of warrior found in the world.

(5) "Again, some warrior can endure the cloud of dust, the crests of the standards, the uproar, [90] and the blows. Having triumphed in that battle, he emerges victorious and settles at the head of the battlefield. There is, bhikkhus, such a warrior here. This is the fifth kind of warrior found in the world.

"These are the five kinds of warriors found in the world.

"So too, there are these five kinds of persons similar to warriors found among the bhikkhus. What five?

(1) "Here, some bhikkhu, when he sees the cloud of dust, sinks, founders, does not brace himself, and cannot maintain the spiritual life. He discloses his weakness in the training, gives up the training, and reverts to the lower life. [^1079] What is the cloud of dust in his case? The bhikkhu hears: 'In such and such a village or town the women or girls are beautiful, attractive, graceful, possessing supreme beauty of complexion.' Having heard this, he sinks, founders, does not brace himself, and cannot maintain the spiritual life. He discloses his weakness in the training, gives up the training, and reverts to the lower life. This is the cloud of dust in his case. I say that this person is just like the warrior who, when he sees the cloud of dust, sinks, founders, does not brace himself, and cannot enter the battle. There is, bhikkhus, such a person here. This is the first kind of person similar to a warrior found among the bhikkhus.

(2) "Again, some bhikkhu can endure the cloud of dust, but when he sees the crests of the standards, he sinks, founders, does not brace himself, and cannot maintain the spiritual life. He discloses his weakness in the training, gives up the training, and reverts to the lower life. What are the crests of the standards in his case? The bhikkhu does not hear: 'In such and such a village or town the women or girls are beautiful, attractive, graceful, possessing supreme beauty of complexion,' but he himself sees a woman or a girl who is beautiful, attractive, graceful, possessing supreme beauty of complexion. Having
seen her, he sinks, founders, does not brace himself, and [91] cannot maintain the spiritual life. He discloses his weakness in the training, gives up the training, and reverts to the lower life. These are the crests of the standards in his case. I say that this person is just like the warrior who can endure the cloud of dust, but when he sees the crests of the standards, he sinks, founders, does not brace himself, and cannot enter the battle. There is, bhikkhus, such a person here. This is the second kind of person similar to a warrior found among the bhikkhus.

(3) "Again, some bhikkhu can endure the cloud of dust and the crests of the standards, but when he hears the uproar, he sinks, founders, does not brace himself, and cannot maintain the spiritual life. He discloses his weakness in the training, gives up the training, and reverts to the lower life. What is the uproar in his case? When the bhikkhu has gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, a woman approaches him, smiles at him, chats with him, laughs at him, and teases him. As the woman is smiling at him, chatting with him, laughing at him, and teasing him, he sinks, founders, does not brace himself, and cannot maintain the spiritual life. He discloses his weakness in the training, gives up the training, and reverts to the lower life. This is the uproar in his case. I say that this person is just like the warrior who can endure the cloud of dust and the crests of the standards, but when he hears the uproar, he sinks, founders, does not brace himself, and cannot enter the battle. There is, bhikkhus, such a person here. This is the third kind of person similar to a warrior found among the bhikkhus.

(4) "Again, some bhikkhu can endure the cloud of dust, the crests of the standards, and the uproar, but he is struck down and wounded by a blow. What is the blow in his case? When the bhikkhu has gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, [92] or to an empty hut, a woman approaches him, sits down or lies down next to him, and embraces him. When she does so, he has sexual intercourse with her without having given up the training and disclosed his weakness. This is the blow in his case. I say that this person is just like the warrior who can endure the cloud of dust, the crests of the standards, and the uproar, but who is struck down and wounded by a blow. There is, bhikkhus, such a person here. This is the fourth kind of person similar to a warrior found among the bhikkhus.
(5) "Again, some bhikkhu can endure the clouds of dust, the crests of the standards, the uproar, and a blow. Having triumphed in that battle, he emerges victorious and settles at the head of the battlefield. What is the victory in his case? When the bhikkhu has gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, a woman approaches him, sits down or lies down next to him, and embraces him. But he disentangles himself, frees himself, and goes off wherever he wants.

"He resorts to a secluded lodging: the forest, the foot of a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a jungle highland, the open air, a heap of straw. Gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, he sits down, folding his legs crosswise, straightening his body, and establishing mindfulness in front of him. Having abandoned longing for the world, he dwells with a mind free from longing; he purifies his mind from longing. Having abandoned ill will and hatred, he dwells with a mind free from ill will, compassionate toward all living beings; he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred. Having abandoned dullness and drowsiness, he dwells free from dullness and drowsiness, percipient of light, mindful and clearly comprehending; he purifies his mind from dullness and drowsiness. Having abandoned restlessness and remorse, he dwells without agitation, with a mind inwardly peaceful; he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorse. Having abandoned doubt, he dwells having gone beyond doubt, [93] unperplexed about wholesome qualities; he purifies his mind from doubt.

"Having abandoned these five hindrances, defilements of the mind that weaken wisdom, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna . . . the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity.

"When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, cleansed, unblemished, rid of defilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs it to the knowledge of the destruction of the taints. [^1080] He understands as it really is: 'This is suffering.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the origin of suffering.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the cessation of suffering.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' He understands
as it really is: 'These are the taints.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the origin of the taints.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the cessation of the taints.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the way leading to the cessation of the taints.' When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire, from the taint of existence, and from the taint of ignorance. When it is liberated, there comes the knowledge: '[It's] liberated.' He understands: 'Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.' This is his victory in battle.

"Bhikkhus, I say that this person is like the warrior who can endure the cloud of dust, the crests of the standards, the uproar, and the blow, and who, having triumphed in that battle, emerges victorious and settles at the head of the battlefield. There is, bhikkhus, such a person here. This is the fifth kind of person similar to a warrior found among the bhikkhus.

"These are the five kinds of persons similar to warriors found among the bhikkhus."

# 76 (6) Warriors (2)

"Bhikkhus, there are these five kinds of warriors found in the world. What five?

(1) "Here, some warrior takes up a sword and shield, [94] arms himself with a bow and quiver, and enters the fray of battle. He strives and exerts himself in the battle, but his foes slay him and finish him off. There is, bhikkhus, such a warrior here. This is the first kind of warrior found in the world.

(2) "Again, some warrior takes up a sword and shield, arms himself with a bow and quiver, and enters the fray of battle. He strives and exerts himself in the battle, but his foes wound him. [His comrades] carry him off and bring him to his relatives. While he is being brought to his relatives, he dies along the way even before he arrives. There is, bhikkhus, such a warrior here. This is the second kind of warrior found in the world.

(3) "Again, some warrior takes up a sword and shield, arms himself with a bow and quiver, and enters the fray of battle. He strives and exerts himself in the battle, but his foes wound him. [His comrades] carry him off and bring him to his relatives. His relatives nurse him and look after him, but while they are doing
so he dies from that injury. There is, bhikkhus, such a warrior here. This is the third kind of warrior found in the world.

(4) "Again, some warrior takes up a sword and shield, arms himself with a bow and quiver, and enters the fray of battle. He strives and exerts himself in the battle, but his foes wound him. [His comrades] carry him off and bring him to his relatives. His relatives nurse him and look after him, and as a result he recovers from that injury. There is, bhikkhus, such a warrior here. This is the fourth kind of warrior found in the world.

(5) "Again, some warrior takes up a sword and shield, arms himself with a bow and quiver, and enters the fray of battle. Having triumphed in that battle, he emerges victorious [95] and settles at the head of the battlefield. There is, bhikkhus, such a warrior here. This is the fifth kind of warrior found in the world.

"These are the five kinds of warriors found in the world.

"So too, there are these five kinds of persons similar to warriors found among the bhikkhus. What five?

(1) "Here, some bhikkhu dwells in dependence upon a certain village or town. In the morning, he dresses, takes his robe and bowl, and enters that village or town for alms, with body, speech, and mind unguarded, without having established mindfulness, his sense faculties unrestrained. There he sees women with their dress in disarray and loosely attired. When he sees them, lust invades his mind. With his mind invaded by lust, he has sexual intercourse without having disclosed his weakness and given up the training. This person, I say, is just like the warrior who takes up a sword and shield, arms himself with a bow and quiver, and enters the fray of battle, and whose foes slay him and finish him off while he is striving and exerting himself in battle. There is, bhikkhus, such a person here. This is the first kind of person similar to a warrior found among the bhikkhus.

(2) "Again, some bhikkhu dwells in dependence upon a certain village or town. In the morning, he dresses, takes his robe and bowl, and enters that village or town for alms ... [and] lust invades his mind. With his mind invaded by lust, he burns bodily and mentally [with the fever of lust]. He thinks: 'Let me return to the monastery [96] and inform the bhikkhus: "Friends, I am obsessed by lust, oppressed by lust. I cannot maintain the
spiritual life. Having disclosed my weakness in the training, I will give up the training and revert to the lower life." While he is returning to the monastery, even before he arrives, he discloses his weakness in the training, gives up the training, and reverts to the lower life along the way. This person, I say, is just like the warrior who takes up a sword and shield, arms himself with a bow and quiver, enters the fray of battle, is wounded by his foes while he strives and exerts himself in the battle, and is then carried off and brought to his relatives but dies along the way even before he arrives. There is, bhikkhus, such a person here. This is the second kind of person similar to a warrior found among the bhikkhus.

(3) "Again, some bhikkhu dwells in dependence upon a certain village or town. In the morning, he dresses, takes his robe and bowl, and enters that village or town for alms ... [and] lust invades his mind. With his mind invaded by lust, he burns bodily and mentally [with the fever of lust]. He thinks: 'Let me return to the monastery and inform the bhikkhus: "Friends, I am obsessed by lust, oppressed by lust. I cannot maintain the spiritual life. Having disclosed my weakness in the training, I will give up the training and revert to the lower life." He returns to the monastery and informs the bhikkhus: 'Friends, I am obsessed by lust, oppressed by lust. I cannot maintain the spiritual life. Having disclosed my weakness in the training, I will give up the training and revert to the lower life.' His fellow monks then exhort and instruct him: [97] 'Friend, the Blessed One has stated that sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering and anguish, and that the danger in them is more. [^1081] With the simile of the skeleton the Blessed One has stated that sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering and anguish, and that the danger in them is more. With the simile of the piece of meat..., with the simile of the grass torch... with the simile of the charcoal pit... with the simile of the dream... with the simile of the borrowed goods... with the simile of fruits on a tree . . . with the simile of the butcher's knife and block . . . with the simile of the sword stake . . . with the simile of the snake's head, the Blessed One has stated that sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering and anguish, and that the danger in them is more. Enjoy the spiritual life. Do not think you are unable to follow the training, give it
up, and revert to the lower life.' While he is being exhorted and instructed by his fellow monks in this way, he protests: 'Friends, although the Blessed One has stated that sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering and anguish, and that the danger in them is more, still, I am unable to maintain the spiritual life. Having disclosed my weakness in the training, I will give up the training and revert to the lower life.' Having disclosed his weakness in the training, he gives up the training and reverts to the lower life. This person, I say, is just like the warrior who takes up a sword and shield, arms himself with a bow and quiver, enters the fray of battle, is wounded by his foes while he strives and exerts himself in the battle, and is then carried off [98] and brought to his relatives, who nurse him and look after him, but who dies from that injury. There is, bhikkhus, such a person here. This is the third kind of person similar to a warrior found among the bhikkhus.

His fellow monks then exhort and instruct him: 'Friend, the Blessed One has stated that sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering and anguish, and that the danger in them is more. With the simile of the skeleton . . . [99] . . . with the simile of the snake's head, the Blessed One has stated that sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering and anguish, and that the danger in them is more. Enjoy the spiritual life. Do not think you are unable to follow the training, give it up, and revert to the lower life.' While he is being exhorted and instructed by his fellow monks in this way, he says: 'I will try, friends, I will carry on, I will enjoy it. I won't think I am unable
to follow the training, give it up, and revert to the lower life.' This person, I say, is just like the warrior who takes up a sword and shield, arms himself with a bow and quiver, and enters the fray of battle, who is wounded by his foes while he strives and exerts himself in the battle, and is then carried off and brought to his relatives, who nurse him and look after him, and who then recovers from that injury. There is, bhikkhus, such a person here. This is the fourth kind of person similar to a warrior found among the bhikkhus.

(5) "Again, some bhikkhu dwells in dependence upon a certain village or town. In the morning, he dresses, takes his robe and bowl, and enters that village or town for alms with body, speech, and mind guarded, mindfulness established, and sense faculties restrained. Having seen a form with the eye, he does not grasp its marks and features. Since, if he left the eye faculty unrestrained, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him, he practices restraint over it; he guards the eye faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. Having heard a sound with the ear . . . Having smelled an odor with the nose... Having tasted a taste with the tongue ... [100]... Having felt a tactile object with the body ... Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, he does not grasp its marks and features. Since, if he left the mind faculty unrestrained, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him, he practices restraint over it; he guards the mind faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty. After his meal, on returning from his alms round, he resorts to a secluded lodging: the forest, the foot of a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a jungle highland, the open air, a heap of straw. Gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, he sits down, folding his legs crosswise, straightening his body, and establishing mindfulness in front of him. Having abandoned longing for the world ... [as in 5:75]... he purifies his mind from doubt.

"Having abandoned these five hindrances, defilements of the mind that weaken wisdom, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna... the second jhāna... the third jhāna... the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity.
"When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, cleansed, unblemished, rid of defilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs it to the knowledge of the destruction of the taints. He understands as it really is: 'This is suffering'... 'Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.' This person, I say, is just like the warrior who takes up a sword and shield, arms himself with a bow and quiver, enters the fray of battle, and having triumphed in that battle, emerges victorious and settles at the head of the battlefield. There is, bhikkhus, such a person here. This is the fifth kind of person similar to a warrior found among the bhikkhus.

"These are the five kinds of persons similar to warriors found among the bhikkhus."

"Bhikkhus, when a forest bhikkhu considers five future perils, it is enough for him to dwell heedful, ardent, [101] and resolute for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yetunrealized. What five?

(1) "Here, a forest bhikkhu reflects thus: 'I am now dwelling all alone in the forest. But while I am living here, a snake might bite me, a scorpion might sting me, or a centipede might sting me. Because of that I might die, which would be an obstacle for me. Let me now arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yetunattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.'

attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. What five?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'I am now young, a blackhaired young man endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life. But there will come a time when old age assails this body. Now when one is old, overcome by old age, it is not easy to attend to the Buddhas' teaching; it is not easy to resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves. Before that unwished for, undesirable, disagreeable condition comes upon me, let me in advance arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. Thus when I am in that condition, I will dwell at ease even though I am old.' This is the first future peril considering which it is enough for a bhikkhu to dwell heedful, ardent, and resolute . . . for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'I am now seldom ill or afflicted; I possess an even digestion that is neither too cool nor too hot but moderate and suitable for striving. But there will come a time when illness assails this body. Now when one is ill, overcome by illness, it is not easy to attend to the Buddhas' teaching; it is not easy to resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves. Before that unwished for, undesirable, disagreeable condition comes upon me, let me in advance arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.

This is the second future peril considering which it is enough for a bhikkhu to dwell heedful, ardent, and resolute . . . for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.

(3) "Again, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'Food is now plentiful; there has been a good harvest and almsfood is abundant, so that one can easily subsist by means of gleaning. But there will come a time of famine, a poor harvest, when almsfood is hard to obtain and one cannot easily subsist by means of gleaning. In a time of famine, people migrate to places where food is plentiful and living conditions there are congested and crowded. Now when living conditions are congested and crowded, it is not easy to attend to the Buddhas' teaching; it is not easy to resort
to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves.

This is the third future peril considering which it is enough for a bhikkhu to dwell heedful, ardent, and resolute ... for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.

(4) "Again, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'People are now dwelling. in concord, harmoniously, without disputes, blending like milk and water, viewing each other with eyes of affection. But there will come a time of peril, of turbulence in the wilderness, when the people of the countryside, mounted on their vehicles, flee on all sides. In a time of peril, people migrate to places where there is safety and living conditions there are congested and crowded.

This is the fourth future peril considering which it is enough for a bhikkhu to dwell heedful, ardent, and resolute ... for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.

(5) "Again, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'The Sangha is now dwelling at ease-in concord, harmoniously, without disputes, with a single recitation. But there will come a time when there will be a schism in the Sangha. Now when there is a schism in the Sangha, it is not easy to attend to the Buddhas' teaching; it is not easy to resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves.

# 79 (9) Future Perils (3)

"Bhikkhus, there are these five future perils as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You should recognize them [106] and make an effort to abandon them. What five?

(1) "In the future, there will be bhikkhus who are undeveloped in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom. [^1083] They will give full ordination to others but will not be able to discipline them in the higher virtuous behavior, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom. These [pupils] too will be undeveloped in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom. They in turn will give full ordination to others but will not be able to discipline them in the higher virtuous behavior, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom. These [pupils] too will be undeveloped in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom. Thus, bhikkhus, through corruption of the Dhamma comes corruption of the discipline, and from corruption of the discipline comes corruption of the Dhamma. [^1084] This is the first future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You should recognize it and make an effort to abandon it.

(3) "Again, in the future there will be bhikkhus who are undeveloped in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom. While engaged in talk pertaining to the Dhamma, in questions-and-answers, [^1096] they will slide down into a dark Dhamma but will not recognize it. Thus, bhikkhus, through corruption of the Dhamma comes corruption of the discipline, and from corruption of the discipline comes corruption of the Dhamma. This is the third future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You should recognize it and make an effort to abandon it.

(4) "Again, in the future there will be bhikkhus who are undeveloped in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom. When those discourses spoken by the Tathāgata are being recited that are deep, deep in meaning, world-transcending, connected with emptiness, they will not want to listen to them, will not lend an ear to them, or apply their minds to understand them; they will not think those teachings should be studied and learned. [^1087] But when those discourses are being recited that are mere poetry composed by poets, beautiful in words and phrases, created by outsiders, spoken by disciples, they will want to listen to them, lend an ear to them, and apply their minds to understand them; they will think those teachings should be studied and learned. Thus, bhikkhus, through corruption of the Dhamma comes corruption of the discipline, and from corruption of the discipline comes corruption of the Dhamma.

(5) "Again, in the future there will be bhikkhus who are undeveloped in body, virtuous behavior, mind, [108] and wisdom. The elder bhikkhus-being undeveloped in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom-will be luxurious and lax, leaders in backsliding, discarding the duty of solitude; they will not arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. Those in the next generation will follow their example.

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu who is a trainee does not have many tasks and duties; though he is competent in the various chores that must be done, he does not neglect seclusion but devotes himself to internal serenity of mind. This is the first thing that leads to the non-decline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee.

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu who is a trainee does not spend the day on some trifling work, so he does not neglect seclusion but devotes himself to internal serenity of mind. This is the second thing that leads to the non-decline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee.

(3) "Again, a bhikkhu who is a trainee does not bond closely with householders and monastics, socializing in an unfitting manner typical of laypeople, so he does not neglect seclusion but devotes himself to internal serenity of mind. [118] This is the third thing that leads to the non-decline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee.

(4) "Again, a bhikkhu who is a trainee does not enter a village too early or return too late in the day, so he does not neglect seclusion but devotes himself to internal serenity of mind. This is the fourth thing that leads to the non-decline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee.

(5) "Again, a bhikkhu who is a trainee gets to hear at will, without trouble or difficulty, talk concerned with the austere life that is conducive to opening up the heart, that is, talk on fewness of desires . . . on the knowledge and vision of liberation; so he does not neglect seclusion but devotes himself to internal serenity of mind. This is the fifth thing that leads to the nondecline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee.

"These five things lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee."

These are the five kinds of dwelling at ease."

## 95 (5) The Unshakable

"Bhikkhus, possessing five things, a bhikkhu in no long time penetrates to the unshakable. [^1099] What five? [120] Here, a bhikkhu has attained the analytical knowledge of meaning, the analytical knowledge of the Dhamma, the analytical knowledge of language, and the analytical knowledge of discernment; and he reviews the extent to which his mind is liberated. Possessing these five things, a bhikkhu in no long time penetrates to the unshakable."

96 (6) What One Has Learned

"Bhikkhus, possessing five things, a bhikkhu pursuing mindfulness of breathing in no long time penetrates to the unshakable. What five? (1) Here, a bhikkhu has few undertakings, few tasks, is easy to support, and is easily contented with the requisites of life. (2) He eats little and is intent on abstemiousness regarding food. (3) He is seldom drowsy and is intent on vigilance. (4) He has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and accumulates what he has learned.

# 99 (9) The Lion

"Bhikkhus, in the evening the lion, the king of beasts, comes out from his lair, stretches his body, surveys the four quarters all around, and roars his lion's roar three times. Then he sets out in search of game.

(1) "If he gives a blow to an elephant, he always gives the blow respectfully, not disrespectfully. [^100] (2) If he gives a blow to a buffalo... (3) ... to a cow... (4) ... to a leopard... (5) If he gives a blow [122] to any smaller animals, even a hare or a cat, he gives the blow respectfully, not disrespectfully. For what reason? [Thinking:] 'Let my training not be lost.'

"The lion, bhikkhus, is a designation for the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. When the Tathāgata teaches the Dhamma to an assembly, this is his lion's roar. (1) If the Tathāgata teaches the Dhamma to bhikkhus, he teaches it respectfully, not disrespectfully. (2) If the Tathāgata teaches the Dhamma to bhikkhunis... (3) ... to male lay followers... (4) ... to female lay followers, he teaches it respectfully, not disrespectfully. (5) If the Tathāgata teaches the Dhamma to worldlings, even to food-carriers and hunters, [^1101] he teaches it respectfully, not disrespectfully. For what reason? Because the Tathāgata has respect for the Dhamma, reverence for the Dhamma."

## 100 (10) Kakudha

Thus have I heard. [^1102] On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita's Park. Now on that occasion Kakudha the Koliyan son, the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna's attendant, had recently died and been reborn among a certain group of mind-made [deities]. [^1103] His body was two or three times the size of the fields of a Magadhan village, but he did not obstruct either himself or others with that body. [^1104]

Then the young deva Kakudha approached the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and [123] said to him: "Bhante, such a desire arose in Devadatta: 'I will take charge of the Sangha of bhikkhus.' And together with the arising of this thought, Devadatta lost that psychic
potency." [^1105] This is what the young deva Kakudha said. He then paid homage to the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and disappeared right there.

Then the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and reported all that had happened. [The Blessed One said:] "But, Moggallāna, have you encompassed his mind with your mind and understood of the young deva Kakudha: 'Whatever the young deva Kakudha says is all true and not otherwise'?"

"Yes, Bhanite."

"Take note of this statement, Moggallāna! Now that foolish man will, of his own accord, expose himself.

"There are, Moggallāna, these five kinds of teachers found in the world. What five? [124]

(1) "Here, some teacher whose behavior is unpurified claims: 'I am one whose behavior is purified. My behavior is purified, cleansed, undefiled.' His disciples know him thus: 'This honorable teacher, though of unpurified behavior, claims: "I am one whose behavior is purified. My behavior is purified, cleansed, undefiled." Now he would not like it if we were to report this to the laypeople. How can we treat him in a way that he would not like? Further, he is honored with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick. A person will be known by what he himself does. [^1106] His disciples cover up such a teacher with respect to his behavior, and such a teacher expects to be covered up by his disciples with respect to his behavior.

(2) "Again, some teacher whose livelihood is unpurified claims: 'I am one whose livelihood is purified. My livelihood is purified, cleansed, undefiled.' His disciples know him thus: 'This honorable teacher, though of unpurified livelihood, claims: "I am one whose livelihood is purified. My livelihood is purified, cleansed, undefiled." Now he would not like it if we were to report this to the laypeople. How can we treat him in a way that he would not like? Further, he is honored with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick. A person will be known by what he himself does.' His disciples cover up such a teacher with respect to his livelihood, and such a teacher expects to be covered up by his disciples with respect to his livelihood.
(3) "Again, some teacher whose Dhamma teaching is unpurified claims: 'I am one whose Dhamma teaching is purified. My Dhamma teaching is purified, cleansed, undefiled.' His disciples know him thus: 'This honorable teacher, though of unpurified Dhamma teaching, [125] claims: "I am one whose Dhamma teaching is purified. My Dhamma teaching is purified, cleansed, undefiled." Now he would not like it if we were to report this to the laypeople. How can we treat him in a way that he would not like? Further, he is honored with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick. A person will be known by what he himself does.' His disciples cover up such a teacher with respect to his Dhamma teaching; and such a teacher expects to be covered up by his disciples with respect to his Dhamma teaching.

(4) "Again, some teacher whose explanations are unpurified [^1107] claims: 'I am one whose explanations are purified. My explanations are purified, cleansed, undefiled.' His disciples know him thus: 'This honorable teacher, though giving unpurified explanations, claims: "I am one whose explanations are purified. My explanations are purified, cleansed, undefiled." Now he would not like it if we were to report this to the laypeople. How can we treat him in a way that he would not like? Further, he is honored with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick. A person will be known by what he himself does.' His disciples cover up such a teacher with respect to his explanations, and such a teacher expects to be covered up by his disciples with respect to his explanations.

(5) "Again, some teacher whose knowledge and vision are unpurified claims: 'I am one whose knowledge and vision are purified. My knowledge and vision are purified, cleansed, undefiled.' His disciples know him thus: 'This honorable teacher, though of unpurified knowledge and vision, claims: "I am one whose knowledge and vision are purified. My knowledge and vision are purified, cleansed, undefiled." Now he would not like it if we were to report this to the laypeople. How can we treat him in a way that he would not like? [126] Further, he is honored with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick. A person will be known by what he himself does.' His disciples cover up such a teacher with respect to his knowledge and vision, and such a teacher expects to be
covered up by his disciples with respect to his knowledge and vision.

"These are five kinds of teachers found in the world.

(1) "But, Moggallāna, I am one whose behavior is purified and I claim: 'I am one whose behavior is purified. My behavior is purified, cleansed, undefiled.' My disciples do not cover me up with respect to my behavior, and I do not expect to be covered up by my disciples with respect to my behavior. (2) I am one whose livelihood is purified and I claim: 'I am one whose livelihood is purified. My livelihood is purified, cleansed, undefiled.' My disciples do not cover me up with respect to my livelihood, and I do not expect to be covered up by my disciples with respect to my livelihood. (3) I am one whose Dhamma teaching is purified and I claim: 'I am one whose Dhamma teaching is purified. My Dhamma teaching is purified, cleansed, undefiled.' My disciples do not cover me up with respect to my Dhamma teaching, and I do not expect to be covered up by my disciples with respect to my Dhamma teaching. (4) I am one whose explanations are purified and I claim: 'I am one whose explanations are purified. My explanations are purified, cleansed, undefiled.' My disciples do not cover me up with respect to my explanations, and I do not expect to be covered up by my disciples with respect to my explanations. (5) I am one whose knowledge and vision are purified and I claim: 'I am one whose knowledge and vision are purified. My knowledge and vision are purified, cleansed, undefiled.' My disciples do not cover me up with respect to my knowledge and vision, and I do not expect to be covered up by my disciples with respect to my knowledge and vision." [127]

# The Third Fifty

## I. Dwelling at Ease

## 101 (1) Timidity

"Bhikkhus, there are these five qualities that make for self-confidence in a trainee. [^1108] What five? Here, a bhikkhu is endowed with faith and is virtuous, learned, energetic, and wise. (1) Whatever timidity [^1109] there is in one without faith does not exist
in one endowed with faith; therefore this quality makes for selfconfidence in a traince. (2) Whatever timidity there is in one who is immoral does not exist in one who is virtuous; therefore this quality makes for self-confidence in a trainee. (3) Whatever timidity there is in one who is unlearned does not exist in one who is learned; therefore this quality makes for self-confidence in a trainee. (4) Whatever timidity there is in one who is lazy does not exist in one who is energetic; therefore this quality makes for self-confidence in a trainee. (5) Whatever timidity there is in one who is unwise does not exist in one who is wise; therefore this quality makes for self-confidence in a trainee. These are the five qualities that make for self-confidence in a trainee." [128]

# 102 (2) Suspected

"Bhikkhus, on five grounds a bhikkhu is suspected and distrusted as 'an evil bhikkhu' though he be of unshakable character. [^1110] What five? Here, a bhikkhu often visits prostitutes, widows, unmarried women, eunuchs, or bhikkhunis. [^1111] On these five grounds a bhikkhu is suspected and distrusted as 'an evil bhikkhu' though he be of unshakable character.".

## 103 (3) A Thief [^1112]

"Bhikkhus, possessing five factors, a master thief breaks into houses, plunders wealth, commits banditry, and ambushes highways. What five? Here, a master thief (1) depends upon the uneven, (2) on thickets, and (3) on powerful people; (4) he offers bribes, and (5) he moves alone.

(1) "And how does a master thief depend on the uneven? Here, a master thief depends on rivers that are hard to cross and rugged mountains. It is in this way that a master thief depends on the uneven.

(2) "And how does a master thief depend on thickets? Here, a master thief depends on a thicket of cane, a thicket of trees, a coppice, or a large dense jungle. It is in this way that a master thief depends on thickets.

(3) "And how does a master thief depend on powerful people? Here, a master thief depends on kings or royal ministers. He thinks: 'If anyone [129] accuses me of anything, these kings or royal ministers will dismiss the case.' If anyone accuses
him of anything, those kings or royal ministers dismiss the case. It is in this way that a master thief depends on powerful people.

(4) "And how does a master thief offer bribes? Here, a master thief is rich, with great wealth and property. He thinks: 'If anyone should accuse me of anything, I'll placate him with a bribe.' If anyone accuses him of anything, he placates him with a bribe. It is in this way that a master thief offers bribes.

(5) "And how does a master thief move alone? Here, a master thief executes his raids [^1113] all alone. For what reason? [With the thought:] 'My secret deliberations [^1114] shouldn't spread to others!' It is in this way that a master thief moves alone.

"It is by possessing these five factors that a master thief breaks into houses, plunders wealth, commits banditry, and ambushes highways.

"So too, bhikkhús, possessing five qualities, an evil bhikkhu maintains himself in a maimed and injured condition, is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise, and generates much demerit. What five? Here, an evil bhikkhu (1) depends on the uneven, (2) depends on thickets, and (3) depends on powerful people; (4) he offers bribes and (5) moves alone.

(1) "And how does an evil bhikkhu depend on the uneven? Here, an evil bhikkhu engages in unrighteous bodily, verbal, and mental action. It is in this way that an evil bhikkhu depends on the uneven.

(2) "And how does an evil bhikkhu depend on thickets? [130] Here, an evil bhikkhu holds wrong view; he has adopted an extremist view. [^115] It is in this way that an evil bhikkhu depends upon thickets.

(3) "And how does an evil bhikkhu depend on powerful people? Here, an evil bhikkhu depends on kings or royal ministers. He thinks: 'If anyone should accuse me of anything, these kings or royal ministers will dismiss the case.' If anyone accuses him of anything, those kings or royal ministers dismiss the case. It is in this way that an evil bhikkhu depends on the powerful people.

(4) "And how does an evil bhikkhu offer bribes? Here, an evil bhikkhu gains robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick. He thinks: 'If anyone should accuse me of anything, I'll placate him with one of these gains.' If anyone
accuses him of anything, he placates him with one of his gains. It is in this way that an evil bhikkhu offers bribes.

(5) "And how does an evil bhikkhu move alone? Here, an evil bhikkhu sets up a solitary residence for himself in the borderlands. Approaching families there, he obtains gains. It is in this way that an evil bhikkhu moves alone.

"It is by possessing these five qualities that an evil bhikkhu maintains himself in a maimed and injured condition, is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise, and generates much demerit."

# 104 (4) Delicate [^1116]

"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a bhikkhu is a delicate ascetic among ascetics. What five? (1) He usually uses a robe that has been specifically offered to him, seldom one that has not been specifically offered to him; he usually eats almsfood that has been specifically offered to him, seldom almsfood that has not been specifically offered to him; he usually uses a lodging that has been specifically offered to him, seldom one that has not been specifically offered to him; he usually uses medicines and provisions for the sick that have been specifically offered to him, seldom those that have not been specifically offered to him. [131] (2) His fellow monks, those with whom he dwells, usually behave toward him in agreeable ways by body, speech, and mind, seldom in disagreeable ways. They usually present him what is agreeable, seldom what is disagreeable. (3) Discomfort originating from bile, phlegm, wind, or their combination; discomfort produced by change of climate; discomfort produced by careless behavior; discomfort produced by assault; or discomfort produced as the result of kamma-these do not often arise in him. He is seldom ill. (4) He gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life. (5) With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. It is by possessing these five qualities that a bhikkhu is a delicate ascetic among ascetics.

"If, bhikkhus, one could rightly say of anyone: 'He is a
delicate ascetic among ascetics,' it is precisely of me that one might say this. (1) For I usually use a robe that has been specifically offered to me, seldom one that has not been specifically offered to me; I usually eat almsfood that has been specifically offered to me, seldom almsfood that has not been specifically offered to me; I usually use a lodging that has been specifically offered to me, seldom one that has not been specifically offered to me; I usually use medicines and provisions for the sick that have been specifically offered to me, seldom those that have not been specifically offered to me. (2) Those bhikkhus with whom I dwell usually behave toward me in agreeable ways by body, speech, and mind, seldom in disagreeable ways. They usually present me what is agreeable, seldom what is disagreeable. (3) Discomfort originating from bile, phlegm, wind, or their combination; discomfort produced by change of climate; discomfort produced by careless behavior; discomfort produced by assault; or discomfort produced as the result of kamma-these [132] do not often arise in me. I am seldom ill. (4) I gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life. (5) With the destruction of the taints, I have realized for myself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, I dwell in it. If, bhikkhus, one could rightly say of anyone: 'He is a delicate ascetic among ascetics,' it is precisely of me that one might say this."

# 105 (5) At Ease

"Bhikkhus, there are these five means of dwelling at ease. [^117] What five? (1) Here, a bhikkhu maintains bodily acts of lovingkindness toward his fellow monks, both openly and privately. (2) He maintains verbal acts of loving-kindness toward his fellow monks, both openly and privately. (3) He maintains mental acts of loving-kindness toward his fellow monks, both openly and privately. (4) He dwells both openly and privately possessing in common with his fellow monks virtuous behavior that is unbroken, flawless, unblemished, unblotched, freeing, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading to concentration. (5) He dwells both openly and privately possessing in common with his fellow monks the view that is noble and emancipating,
which leads one who acts upon it to the complete destruction of suffering. These, bhikkhus, are the five means of dwelling at ease."

# 106 (6) Ānanda

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita's Park. Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:

"(1) Bhante, in what way can a bhikkhu dwell at ease while living in the Sangha?"

"When, Ānanda, [133] a bhikkhu is himself accomplished in virtuous behavior but does not exhort others in regard to virtuous behavior, [^1118] to this extent he can dwell at ease while living in the Sangha."

(2) "But, Bhante, might there be another way by which a bhikkhu can dwell at ease while living in the Sangha?"

"There can be, Ānanda. When a bhikkhu is himself accomplished in virtuous behavior but does not exhort others in regard to virtuous behavior, and he examines himself but does not examine others, to this extent he can dwell at ease while living in the Sangha."

(3) "But, Bhante, might there be another way by which a bhikkhu can dwell at ease while living in the Sangha?"

"There can be, Ānanda. When a bhikkhu is himself accomplished in virtuous behavior but does not exhort others in regard to virtuous behavior, and he examines himself but does not examine others, and he is not well known but is not agitated by lack of renown, to this extent he can dwell at ease while living in the Sangha."

(4) "But, Bhante, might there be another way by which a bhikkhu can dwell at ease while living in the Sangha?"

"There can be, Ānanda. When a bhikkhu is himself accomplished in virtuous behavior but does not exhort others in regard to virtuous behavior; and he examines himself but does not examine others; and he is not well known but is not agitated by lack of renown; and he gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life, to this extent he can dwell at ease while living in the Sangha."
(5) "But, Bhante, might there be another way by which a bhikkhu can dwell at ease while living in the Sangha?"

"There can be, Ānanda. When a bhikkhu is himself accomplished in virtuous behavior but does not exhort others in regard to virtuous behavior; and he examines himself but does not examine others; [134] and he is not well known but is not agitated by lack of renown; and he gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life; and, with the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it, to this extent he can dwell at ease while living in the Sangha. And, Ānanda, I say there is no other way of dwelling at ease more excellent or sublime than this."

# 107 (7) Virtuous Behavior

"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What five? Here, a bhikkhu is accomplished in virtuous behavior, accomplished in concentration, accomplished in wisdom, accomplished in liberation, and accomplished in the knowledge and vision of liberation. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts ... an unsurpassed field of merit for the world." [135]

109 (9) At Home in the Four Quarters

Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life-such teachings as these he has learned much of, retained in mind, recited verbally, mentally investigated, and penetrated well by view. (3) He is content with any kind of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick. (4) He gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life.

# 140 (10) One Who Listens

"Bhikkhus, possessing five factors, a king's bull elephant is worthy of a king, an accessory of a king, and reckoned as a factor of kingship. What five? Here, a king's bull elephant is one who listens, who destroys, who guards, who patiently endures, and who goes.

(1) "And how is a king's bull elephant one who listens? Here, whatever task the elephant trainer sets for it, whether or not [162] it has ever done it before, the king's bull elephant heeds it, attends to it, directs its whole mind to it, and listens with eager ears. It is in this way that a king's bull elephant is one who listens.

(2) "And how is a king's bull elephant one who destroys? Here, when a king's bull elephant has entered the battle, it destroys elephants and elephant riders, horses and cavalry, chariots and charioteers, and infantry. It is in this way that a king's bull elephant is one who destroys.

front quarters, its back quarters, its front feet, its back feet, its head, its ears, its tusks, its trunk, its tail, and its rider. It is in this way that a king's bull elephant is one who guards.

It is in this way that a bhikkhu is one who destroys.

(3) "And how is a bhikkhu one who guards? Here, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu does not grasp its marks and features. Since, if he left the eye faculty unrestrained, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade
him, he practices restraint over it; he guards the eye faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. Having heard a sound with the ear . . . Having smelled an odor with the nose . . .

# V. TIKANDAKI

141 (1) Having Given, One Despises

"Bhikkhus, there are these five kinds of persons found in the world. What five? The one who gives and then despises; the one who despises as a result of living together; the one gullible for gossip; the capricious one; and the one who is dull and stupid.

(1) "And how is a person one who gives and then despises? Here, one person gives another a robe, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick. It occurs to him: 'I give; he receives.' Having given to him, he despises him. It is in this way that a person is one who gives and then despises.

(2) "And how does a person despise as a result of living
together? [165] Here, one person lives together with another for two or three years. He then despises the other because they have lived together. It is in this way that a person despises as a result of living together.

(3) "And how is a person gullible for gossip? Here, when praise or dispraise is being spoken about another person, he readily believes it. It is in this way that a person is gullible for gossip.

(4) "And how is a person capricious? Here, a person's faith, devotion, affection, and confidence are fickle. It is in this way that a person is capricious.

(5) "And how is a person dull and stupid? Here, a person does not know which qualities are wholesome and which unwholesome, which qualities are blameworthy and which blameless, which qualities are inferior and which superior; he does not know dark and bright qualities along with their counterparts. It is in this way that a person is dull and stupid:

"These, bhikkhus, are the five kinds of persons found in the world."

# 142 (2) One Violates

"Bhikkhus, there are these five kinds of persons found in the world. What five?

(1) "Here, one person violates and then becomes remorseful, and does not understand as it really is the liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, where these arisen bad unwholesome states of his cease without remainder. [^1140]

(2) "Here, one person violates and does not become remorseful, [^1141] and does not understand as it really is the liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, where these arisen bad unwholesome states of his cease without remainder.

(3) "Here, one person does not violate [166] and yet becomes remorseful, [^1142] and does not understand as it really is the liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, where these arisen bad unwholesome states of his cease without remainder.

(4) "Here, one person does not violate and does not become remorseful, and does not understand as it really is the liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, where these arisen bad unwholesome states of his cease without remainder.

(5) "Here, one person does not violate and does not become
remorseful, and understands as it really is the liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, where these arisen bad unwholesome states of his cease without remainder.

(1) "Bhikkhus, the person among these who violates and then becomes remorseful, and does not understand as it really is the liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, where these arisen bad unwholesome states of his cease without remainder, should be told: 'Taints born of violation are found in you, and taints born of remorse increase. Please abandon the taints born of violation and dispel the taints born of remorse; then develop your mind and wisdom. [^143] In this way you will be exactly the same as the fifth type of person.'

(2) "The person among these who violates and does not become remorseful, and does not understand as it really is the liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, where these arisen bad unwholesome states of his cease without remainder, should be told: 'Taints born of violation are found in you, but taints born of remorse do not increase. Please abandon the taints born' of violation, and then develop your mind and wisdom. In this way you will be exactly the same as the fifth type of person.'

(3) "The person among these who does not violate and yet becomes remorseful, and does not understand as it really is the liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, where these arisen bad unwholesome states of his cease without remainder, should be told: [167] 'Taints born of violation are not found in you, yet taints born of remorse increase. Please dispel the taints born of remorse, and then develop your mind and wisdom. In this way you will be exactly the same as the fifth type of person.'

(4) "The person among these who does not violate and does not become remorseful, and does not understand as it really is the liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, where these arisen bad unwholesome states of his cease without remainder, should be told: 'Taints born of violation are not found in you, and taints born of remorse do not increase. Please develop your mind and wisdom. In this way you will be exactly the same as the fifth type of person.'

(5) "Thus, bhikkhus, when persons of these four types are exhorted and instructed by the example of the fifth type of person, they gradually attain the destruction of the taints."

143 (3) Sārandada

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Vesālī for alms. Now on that occasion five hundred Licchavis had assembled at the Sārandada Shrine and were sitting together when this conversation arose: "The manifestation of five gems is rare in the world. What five? The elephant-gem, the horse-gem, the jewel-gem, the woman-gem, and the stewardgem. The manifestation of these five gems is rare in the world." [168]

Then the Licchavis stationed a man on the road and told him: "Good man, when you see the Blessed One coming, you should inform us." The man saw the Blessed One coming in the distance, went to the Licchavis, and told them: "Sirs, this Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One is coming. You may go at your own convenience."

Then the Licchavis approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. Standing there, they said to him: "Please, Bhante, let the Blessed One go to the Sārandada Shrine out of compassion." The Blessed One silently consented. He went to the Sārandada Shrine, sat down on a seat that was prepared, and said to the Licchavis:

"What discussion were you engaged in just now as you were sitting together here? What was the conversation that was underway?"

"Here, Bhante, when we had assembled and were sitting together, this conversation arose ... [He here repeats the entire conversation above.] ...'The manifestation of these five gems is rare in the world."

"Intent on sensual pleasures, the Licchavis were engaged in a conversation about sensual pleasures! Licchavis, the manifestation of five gems is rare in the world. What five? (1) The manifestation of a Tathāgata, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One is rare in the world. (2) A person who teaches the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by a Tathāgata [169] is rare in the world. (3) When the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by a Tathāgata has been taught, a person who understands it is rare in the world. (4) When the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by a Tathāgata has been taught and understood, a
person who practices in accordance with the Dhamma is rare in the world. (5) A grateful and thankful person is rare in the world. Licchavis, the manifestation of these five gems is rare in the world."

# 144 (4) Tikandakī

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāketa in the Tikandakī Grove. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"(1) Bhikkhus, it is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to dwell perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive. (2) It is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to dwell perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive. (3) It is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to dwell perceiving the repulsive in both the unrepulsive and the repulsive.

(5) It is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to dwell equanimous, mindful and clearly comprehending, having turned away from both the repulsive and the unrepulsive. [^1144]

(1) "And for the sake of what benefit should a bhikkhu dwell perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive? 'Let no lust arise in me toward things provocative of lust!': for the sake of this benefit a bhikkhu should dwell perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive.

(2) "And for the sake of what benefit should a bhikkhu dwell perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive? 'Let no hatred arise in me toward things provocative of hatred!': for the sake of this benefit a bhikkhu should dwell perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive.

(4) "And for the sake of what benefit should a bhikkhu dwell perceiving the unrepulsive in both the repulsive and the
unrepulsive? 'Let no hatred arise in me toward things provocative of hatred, and no lust toward things provocative of lust!': for the sake of this benefit a bhikkhu should dwell perceiving the unrepulsive in both the repulsive and the unrepulsive.

(5) "And for the sake of what benefit should a bhikkhu dwell equanimous, mindful and clearly comprehending, having turned away from both the repulsive and the unrepulsive? 'Let no lust at all arise in me anywhere in any way regarding things provocative of lust! Let no hatred at all arise in me anywhere in any way regarding things provocative of hatred! May no delusion at all arise in me anywhere in any way regarding things that breed delusion!': [^145] for the sake of this benefit a bhikkhu should dwell equanimous, mindful and clearly comprehending, having turned away from both the repulsive and the unrepulsive."

# 145 (5) Hell

"Bhikkhus, one possessing five qualities is deposited in hell as if brought there. What five?

"Bhikkhus, these five things lead to the decline of a temporarily liberated bhikkhu. [^1148] What five?

(1) Here, the bhikkhus do not respectfully listen to the Dhamma; (2) they do not respectfully learn the Dhamma; (3) they do not respectfully retain the Dhamma in mind; (4) they do not respectfully examine the meaning of the teachings they have retained in mind; (5) they do not respectfully understand the meaning and the Dhamma and then practice in accordance with the Dhamma. These five things lead to the deçine and disappearance of the good Dhamma.

"Bhikkhus, there are these five [other] things that lead to the continuation, non-decline, and non-disappearance of the good Dhamma. What five? (1) Here, the bhikkhus respectfully listen to the Dhamma; (2) they respectfully learn the Dhamma; (3) they respectfully retain the Dhamma in mind; (4) they respectfully examine the meaning of the teachings they have retained in mind; (5) they respectfully understand the meaning and the

Dhamma and then practice in accordance with the Dhamma. [177] These five things lead to the continuation, non-decline, and non-disappearance of the good Dhamma."

# 155 (5) Decline of the Good Dhamma (2)

"Bhikkhus, there are these five things that lead to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma. What five?

(1) "Here, the bhikkhus do not learn the Dhamma: discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts, and questions-andanswers. This is the first thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma.

(2) "Again, the bhikkhus do not teach the Dhamma to others in detail as they have heard it and learned it. This is the second thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma.

(3) "Again, the bhikkhus do not make others repeat the Dhamma in detail as they have heard it and learned it. This is the third thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma.

(4) "Again, the bhikkhus do not recite the Dhamma in detail as they have heard it and learned it. This is the fourth thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma.

(5) "Again, the bhikkhus do not ponder, examine, and mentally inspect the Dhamma as they have heard it and learned it. This is the fifth thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma.

"These are the five things that lead to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma.

"Bhikkhus, there are these five [other] things that lead to the continuation, non-decline, and non-disappearance of the good Dhamma. What five?

156 (6) Decline of the Good Dhamma (3)

"Bhikkhus, there are these five things that lead to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma. What five? [^1151]

(1) "Here, the bhikkhus learn discourses that have been badly acquired, with badly set down words and phrases. When the words and phrases are badly set down, the meaning is badly interpreted. This is the first thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma.

(2) "Again, the bhikkhus are difficult to correct and possess qualities that make them difficult to correct. They are impatient and do not accept instruction respectfully. This is the second thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma. [179]

(3) "Again, those bhikkhus who are learned, heirs to the heritage, experts on the Dhamma, experts on the discipline, experts on the outlines, do not respectfully teach the discourses to others. When they have passed away, the discourses are cut off at the root, left without anyone to preserve them. This is the third thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma.

(4) "Again, the elder bhikkhus are luxurious and lax, leaders in backsliding, discarding the duty of solitude; they do not arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. [Those in] the next generation follow their example. They, too, become luxurious and lax, leaders in
backsliding, discarding the duty of solitude; they, too, do not arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. This is the fourth thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma.

(5) "Again, there is a schism in the Sangha, and when there is a schism in the Sangha there are mutual insults, mutual reviling, mutual disparagement, and mutual rejection. Then those without confidence do not gain confidence, while some of those with confidence change their minds. [^1152] This is the fifth thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma.

"These are the five things that lead to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma.

"There are, bhikkhus, these five [other] things that lead to the continuation, non-decline, and non-disappearance of the good Dhamma. What five?

(1) "Here, the bhikkhus learn discourses that have been well acquired, with well set-down words and phrases. When the words and phrases are well set down, the meaning is well interpreted. This is the first thing that leads to the continuation, nondecline, and non-disappearance of the good Dhamma. [180]

(2) "Again, the bhikkhus are easy to correct and possess qualities that make them easy to correct. They are patient and accept instruction respectfully. This is the second thing that leads to the continuation, non-decline, and non-disappearance of the good Dhamma.

(3) "Again, those bhikkhus who are learned, experts on the Dhamma, experts on the discipline, experts on the outlines, respectfully teach the discourses to others. When they have passed away, the discourses are not cut off at the root, for there are those who preserve them. This is the third thing that leads to the continuation, non-decline, and non-disappearance of the good Dhamma.

(4) "Again, the elder bhikkhus are not luxurious and lax, but discard backsliding and take the lead in solitude; they arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. [Those in] the next generation follow their example. They, too, do not become luxurious and lax, but discard backsliding and take the lead in solitude; they, too, arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for

(5) "Again, the Sangha is dwelling at ease-in concord, harmoniously, without disputes, with a single recitation. When the Sangha is in concord, there are no mutual insults, no mutual reviling, no mutual disparagement, and no mutual rejection. Then those without confidence gain confidence and those with confidence increase [in their confidence]. This is the fifth thing that leads to the continuation, non-decline, and nondisappearance of the good Dhamma.

"These, bhikkhus, are the five things that lead to the continuation, non-decline, and non-disappearance of the good Dhamma." [181]

# 157.(7) Wrongly Addressed Talk

"Bhikkhus, a talk is wrongly addressed when, having weighed one type of person against another, it is addressed to these five [inappropriate] types of persons. What five? A talk on faith is wrongly addressed to one devoid of faith; a talk on virtuous behavior is wrongly addressed to an immoral person; a talk on learning is wrongly addressed to one of little learning; a talk on generosity is wrongly addressed to a miser; a talk on wisdom is wrongly addressed to an unwise person.

(1) "And why, bhikkhus, is a talk on faith wrongly addressed to one devoid of faith? When a talk on faith is being given, a person devoid of faith loses his temper and becomes irritated, hostile, and stubborn; he displays anger, hatred, and bitterness. For what reason? Because he does not perceive that faith in himself and obtain rapture and joy based upon it. Therefore a talk on faith is wrongly addressed to a person devoid of faith.

(2) "And why is a talk on virtuous behavior wrongly addressed to an immoral person? When a talk on virtuous behavior is being given, an immoral person loses his temper and becomes irritated, hostile, and stubborn; he displays anger, hatred, and bitterness. For what reason? Because he does not perceive that virtuous behavior in himself and obtain rapture and joy based upon it. Therefore a talk on virtuous behavior is wrongly addressed to an immoral person.

(3) "And why is a talk on learning wrongly addressed to
a person of little learning? When a talk on learning is being given, a person of little learning loses his temper and becomes irritated, hostile, and stubborn; he displays anger, hatred, and bitterness. For what reason? Because he does not perceive that learning in himself and obtain rapture and joy based upon it. Therefore a talk on learning is wrongly addressed to a person of little learning.

(4) "And why is a talk on generosity wrongly addressed to a miser? When a talk on generosity is being given, a miser loses his temper and becomes irritated, hostile, and stubborn; he displays anger, hatred, and bitterness: For what reason? Because he does not perceive that generosity in himself and [182] obtain rapture and joy based upon it. Therefore a talk on generosity is wrongly addressed to a miser.

(5) "And why is a talk on wisdom wrongly addressed to an unwise person? When a talk on wisdom is being given, an unwise person loses his temper and becomes irritated, hostile, and stubborn; he displays anger, hatred, and bitterness. For what reason? Because he does not perceive that wisdom in himself and obtain rapture and joy based upon it. Therefore a talk on wisdom is wrongly addressed to an unwise person.

"A talk is wrongly addressed when, having weighed one type of person against another, it is addressed to these five [inappropriate] types of persons.

"Bhikkhus, a talk is properly addressed when, having weighed one type of person against another, it is addressed to these five [appropriate] types of persons. What five? A talk on faith is properly addressed to one endowed with faith; a talk on virtuous behavior is properly addressed to a virtuous person; a talk on learning is properly addressed to a learned person; a talk on generosity is properly addressed to a generous person; a talk on wisdom is properly addressed to a wise person.

(1) "And why, bhikkhus, is a talk on faith properly addressed to one endowed with faith? When a talk on faith is being given, a person endowed with faith does not lose his temper and become irritated, hostile, and stubborn; he does not display anger, hatred, and bitterness. For what reason? Because he perceives that faith in himself and obtains rapture and joy based upon it. Therefore a talk on faith is properly addressed to a person endowed with faith.

(2) "And why is a talk on virtuous behavior properly
addressed to a virtuous person? When a talk on virtuous behavior is being given, a virtuous person does not lose his temper and become irritated, hostile, and stubborn; he does not display anger, hatred, and bitterness. For what reason? Because he perceives that virtuous behavior in himself and obtains rapture and joy based upon it. Therefore a talk on virtuous behavior is properly addressed to a virtuous person.

(3) "And why is a talk on learning properly addressed to a learned person? When a talk on learning is being given, a learned person does not lose his temper and become irritated, hostile, and [183] stubborn; he does not display anger, hatred, and bitterness. For what reason? Because he perceives that learning in himself and obtains rapture and joy based upon it. Therefore a talk on learning is properly addressed to a learned person.

(4) "And why is a talk on generosity properly addressed to a generous person? When a talk on generosity is being given, a generous person does not lose his temper and become irritated, hostile, and stubborn; he does not display anger, hatred, and bitterness. For what reason? Because he perceives that generosity in himself and obtains rapture and joy based upon it. Therefore a talk on generosity is properly addressed to a generous person.

(5) "And why is a talk on wisdom properly addressed to a wise person?

"Bhikkhus, a talk is properly addressed when, having weighed one type of person against another, it is addressed to these five [appropriate] types of persons."

# 158 (8) Timidity [^1153]

"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a bhikkhu is overcome by timidity. What five? Here, a bhikkhu is devoid of faith, immoral, unlearned, lazy, and unwise. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu is overcome by timidity.

"Bhikkhus, possessing five [other] qualities, a bhikkhu is selfconfident. What five? Here, a bhikkhu is endowed with faith,
virtuous, learned, energetic, and wise. [184] Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu is self-confident."

# 159 (9) Udāyī

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita's Park. Now on that occasion the Venerable Udāyī, surrounded by a large assembly of laypeople, was sitting teaching the Dhamma. [^1154] The Venerable Ananda saw this and approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: "Bhante, the Venerable Udāyī, surrounded by a large assembly of laypeople, is teaching the Dhamma."

"It isn't easy, Ānanda, to teach the Dhamma to others. One who teaches the Dhamma to others should first set up five qualities internally. What five? (1) [Having determined:] 'I will give a progressive talk,' one should teach the Dhamma to others. [^1155] (2) [Having determined:] 'I will give a talk that shows reasons,' one should teach the Dhamma to others. [^1156] (3) [Having determined:] 'I will give a talk out of sympathy,' one should teach the Dhamma to others. (4) [Having determined:] 'I will not give a talk while intent on material gain,' one should teach the Dhamma to others. (5) [Having determined:] 'I will give a talk without harming myself or others,' one should teach the Dhamma to others. It isn't easy, Ānanda, to teach the Dhamma to others. One who teaches the Dhamma to others should first set up these five qualities internally."

160 (10) Hard to Dispel

"Bhikkhus, these five things, once arisen, are hard to dispel. What five? [185] Lust, once arisen, is hard to dispel. Hatred... Delusion... Discernment... The urge to travel, once arisen, is hard to dispel. These five things, once arisen, are hard to dispel."

## II. RESENTMENT

161 (1) Removing Resentment (1)

"Bhikkhus, there are these five ways of removing resentment by which a bhikkhu should entirely remove resentment when it has arisen toward anyone. [^1157] What five? (1) One should develop
loving-kindness for the person one resents; in this way one should remove the resentment toward that person. (2) One should develop compassion for the person one resents; in this way one should remove the resentment toward that person. (3) One should develop equanimity toward the person one resents; in this way one should remove the resentment toward that person. [186] (4) One should disregard the person one resents and pay no attention to him; in this way one should remove the resentment toward that person. (5) One should apply the idea of the ownership of kamma to the person one resents, thus: 'This venerable one is the owner of his kamma, the heir of his kamma; he has kamma as his origin, kamma as his relative, kamma as his resort; he will be the heir of any kamma he does, good or bad.' In this way one should remove the resentment toward that person. These are the five ways of removing resentment by which a bhikkhu should entirely remove resentment when it has arisen toward anyone."

# 162 (2) Removing Resentment (2)

There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend," those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:

"Friends, there are these five ways of removing resentment by which a bhikkhu should entirely remove resentment when it has arisen toward anyone. What five? (1) Here, a person's bodily behavior is impure, but his verbal behavior is pure; one should remove resentment toward such a person. (2) A person's verbal behavior is impure, but his bodily behavior is pure; one should also remove resentment toward such a person. (3) A person's bodily behavior and verbal behavior are impure, but from time to time he gains an opening of the mind, placidity of mind; [^1158] one should also remove resentment toward such a person. (4) A person's bodily behavior and verbal behavior are impure, and he does not gain [187] an opening of the mind, placidity of mind from time to time; one should also remove resentment toward such a person. (5) A person's bodily behavior and verbal behavior are pure, and from time to time he gains an opening of the mind, placidity of mind; one should also remove resentment toward such a person.
(1) "How, friends, should resentment be removed toward the person whose bodily behavior is impure but whose verbal behavior is pure? Suppose a rag-robed bhikkhu sees a rag by the roadside. He would press it down with his left foot, spread it out with his right foot, tear off an intact section, and take it away with him; so too, when a person's bodily behavior is impure but his verbal behavior is pure, on that occasion one should not attend to the impurity of his bodily behavior but should instead attend to the purity of his verbal behavior. In this way resentment toward that person should be removed.

(2) "How, friends, should resentment be removed toward the person whose verbal behavior is impure but whose bodily behavior is pure? Suppose there is a pond covered with algae and water plants. A man might arrive, afflicted and oppressed by the heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. He would plunge into the pond, sweep away the algae and water plants with his hands, drink from his cupped hands, and then leave; so too, [188] when a person's verbal behavior is impure but his bodily behavior is pure, on that occasion one should not attend to the impurity of his verbal behavior but should instead attend to the purity of his bodily behavior. In this way resentment toward that person should be removed.

(3) "How, friends, should resentment be removed toward the person whose bodily behavior and verbal behavior are impure but who from time to time gains an opening of the mind, placidity of mind? Suppose there is a little water in a puddle. Then a person might arrive, afflicted and oppressed by the heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. He would think: 'This little bit of water is in the puddle. If I try to drink it with my cupped hands or a vessel, I will stir it up, disturb it, and make it undrinkable. Let me get down on all fours, suck it up like a cow, and depart.' He then gets down on all fours, sucks the water up like a cow, and departs. So too, when a person's bodily behavior and verbal behavior are impure but from time to time he gains an opening of the mind, placidity of mind, on that occasion one should not attend to the impurity of his bodily and verbal behavior, but should instead attend [189] to the opening of the mind, the placidity of mind, he gains from time to time. In this way resentment toward that person should be removed.

(4) "How, friends, should resentment be removed toward the
person whose bodily and verbal behavior are impure and who does not gain an opening of the mind, placidity of mind, from time to time? Suppose a sick, afflicted, gravely ill person was traveling along a highway, and the last village behind him and the next village ahead of him were both far away. He would not obtain suitable food and medicine or a qualified attendant; he would not get [to meet] the leader of the village district. Another man traveling along the highway might see him and arouse sheer compassion, sympathy, and tender concern for him, thinking: 'Oh, may this man obtain suitable food, suitable medicine, and a qualified attendant! May he get [to meet] the leader of the village district! For what reason? So that this man does not encounter calamity and disaster right here.' So too, when a person's bodily and verbal behavior are impure and he does not gain from time to time an opening of the mind, placidity of mind, on that occasion one should arouse sheer compassion, sympathy, and tender concern for him, thinking, 'Oh, may this venerable one abandon bodily misbehavior and develop good bodily behavior; may he abandon verbal misbehavior and develop good verbal behavior; may he abandon mental misbehavior and develop good mental behavior! For what reason? So that, with the breakup of the body, after death, he will not be reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.' In this way resentment toward that person should be removed. [190]

(5) "How, friends, should resentment be removed toward the person whose bodily and verbal behavior are pure and who from time to time gains an opening of the mind, placidity of mind? Suppose there were a pond with clear, sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, a delightful place shaded by various trees. Then a man might arrive, afflicted and oppressed by the heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. Having plunged into the pond, he would bathe and drink, and then, after coming out, he would sit or lie down in the shade of a tree right there. So too, when a person's bodily and verbal behavior are pure and from time to time he gains an opening of the mind, placidity of mind, on that occasion one should attend to his pure bodily behavior, to his pure verbal behavior; and to the opening of the mind, the placidity of mind, that he gains from time to time. In this way resentment toward that person should be removed. Friends, by
means of a person who inspires confidence in every way, the mind gains confidence. [^1159]

"These, friends, are the five ways of removing resentment by means of which a bhikkhu can entirely remove resentment toward whomever it has arisen."

# 163 (3) Discussions

[This sutta is identical with 5:65, except that it is spoken by Sāriputta to the bhikkhus.] [191]

164 (4) Way of Life

[This sutta is identical with 5:66, except that it is spoken by Sāriputta to the bhikkhus.]

165 (5) Asking Questions

There the Venerable Sāriputta . . . said this:

"Friends, whoever asks another person a question does so for five reasons or for a particular one among them. What five? (1) One asks another person a question because of one's dullness and stupidity; (2) one with evil desires, motivated by desire, asks another person a question; [192] (3) one asks another person a question as a way of reviling [the other person]; (4) one asks another person a question because one wishes to learn; (5) or one asks another person a question with the thought: 'If, when he is asked a question by me, he answers correctly, that is good; but if he does not answer correctly, I will give him a correct explanation.' Friends, whoever asks another person a question does so for these five reasons or for a particular one among them. Friends, I ask another person a question with the thought: 'If, when he is asked a question by me, he answers correctly, that is good; but if he does not answer correctly, I will give him a correct explanation.'"

## 166 (6) Cessation

There the Venerable Sāriputta . . . said this:

"Here, friends, a bhikkhu accomplished in virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom might enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is this possibility. But if he does not reach final knowledge in this very life, having been reborn among a certain group of mind-made [deities] that
transcend the company of devas that subsist on edible food, he might [again] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. [^1160] There is this possibility."

When this was said, the Venerable Udāyī said to the Venerable Sāriputta: "This is impossible, friend Sāriputta, it cannot happen that a bhikkhu, having been reborn among a certain group of mind-made [deities] that transcend the company of devas that subsist on edible food, might [again] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is no such possibility."

A second time . . A third time, [193] the Venerable Sāriputta said: "Here, friends, it is possible that a bhikkhu accomplished in virtuous behavior...having been reborn among a certain group of mind-made [deities]...might [again] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is this possibility." A third time, the Venerable Udāyī said to the Venerable Sāriputta: "This is impossible, friend Sāriputta, it cannot happen that a bhikkhu, having been reborn among a certain group of mind-made [deities] . . . might [again] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is no such possibility."

Then it occurred to the Venerable Sāriputta: "The Venerable Udāyī has rejected me up to the third time, and not a single bhikkhu expresses agreement with me. Let me approach the Blessed One." Then the Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and addressed the bhikkhus: "Here, friends, a bhikkhu accomplished in virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom might [again] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is this possibility. If he does not reach final knowledge in this very life, having been reborn among a certain group of mindmade [deities] that transcend the company of devas that subsist on edible food, he might [again] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is this possibility."

When this was said, the Venerable Udāyī said to the Venerable Sāriputta: "This is impossible, friend Sāriputta, it cannot happen that a bhikkhu, having been reborn among a certain group of mind-made [deities] transcending the company of devas that subsist on edible food, might [again] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is no such possibility."

A second time... A third time, the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: "Here, friends, a bhikkhu accomplished in virtuous behavior...[194]... having been reborn among a certain group of mind-made [deities] . . . might [again] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is this possibility." A third time, the Venerable Udāyī said to the Venerable Sāriputta: "This is impossible, friend Sāriputta, it cannot happen that a bhikkhu... reborn among a certain group of mind-made [deities]... might [again] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is no such possibility."

Then it occurred to the Venerable Sāriputta: "Even when I am in the presence of the Blessed One, the Venerable Udāyī rejects me up to the third time, and not a single bhikkhu expresses agreement with me. Let me just keep silent." Then the Venerable Sāriputta fell silent.

Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Udāyī: "Udāyī, just what do you understand by a mind-made group?"

"Bhante, it is those devas that are formless, perceptionmade."1161

"What are you saying, Udāyī, you foolish and incompetent fellow? Yet you think you have to speak up!"

Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ānanda: "Ānanda, do you just look on passively as an elder bhikkhu is being harassed? Don't you have any compassion toward an elder bhikkhu when he's being harassed?"

Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu accomplished in virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom might enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. If he does not reach final knowledge in this very life, then, having been reborn among a certain group of mind-made [deities] that transcend the company of devas that subsist on edible food, he might [again] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is this possibility." This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. [195]

Then, not long after the Blessed One had left, the Venerable Ānanda approached the Venerable Upaväna and said to him: "Here, friend Upavāna, they were harassing other elder bhikkhus, but we didn't question them. [^1162] It would not be surprising
if this evening, when he emerges from seclusion, the Blessed One makes a pronouncement about this matter, and he might call upon the Venerable Upavāṇa himself [to give an account]. [^1163] Just now I feel timid."

Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and went to the meeting hall. He sat down in the appointed seat and said to the Venerable Upavāṇa:

"Upavāna, how many qualities should an elder bhikkhu possess to be pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and to be respected and esteemed by them?"

"Possessing five qualities, Bhante, an elder bhikkhu is pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and is respected and esteemed by them. What five? (1) He is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha... [as in 5:134]... he trains in them. (2) He has learned much... [as in 5:134]... he has penetrated well by view. (3) He is a good speaker with a good delivery; he is gifted with speech that is polished, clear, articulate, expressive of the meaning. (4) He gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life. (5) With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. Possessing these five qualities, an elder is pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and is respected and esteemed by them." [196]

"Good, good, Upavāṇa! Possessing those five qualities, an elder is pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and is respected and esteemed by them. But if these five qualities are not found in an elder bhikkhu, why should his fellow monks honor, respect, esteem, and venerate him? [^1164] On account of his broken teeth, grey hair, and wrinkled skin? But because these five qualities are found in an elder bhikkhu, his fellow monks honor, respect, esteem, and venerate him."

# 167 (7) Reproving

There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus thus: . . .

"Friends, a bhikkhu who wishes to reprove another should first establish five things in himself. What five? (1) [He should consider:] 'I will speak at a proper time, not at an improper time;
(2) I will speak truthfully, not falsely; (3) I will speak gently, not harshly; (4) I will speak in a beneficial way, not in a harmful way; (5) I will speak with a mind of loving-kindness, not while harboring hatred.' A bhikkhu who wishes to reprove another should first establish these five things in himself.

"Here, friends, I see some person being reproved at an improper time, not disturbed [^1165] at a proper time; being reproved about what is false, not disturbed about what is true; being reproved harshly, not disturbed gently; being reproved in a harmful way, not disturbed in a beneficial way; being reproved by one who harbors hatred, not disturbed by one with a mind of loving-kindness.

"Friends, when a bhikkhu is reproved in a way contrary to the Dhamma, non-remorse should be induced in him in five ways: (1) 'Friend, you were reproved at an improper time, not [197] at a proper time; that is sufficient for you to be without remorse. (2) You were reproved falsely, not truthfully; that is sufficient for you to be without remorse. (3) You were reproved harshly, not gently; that is sufficient for you to be without remorse. (4) You were reproved in a harmful way, not in a beneficial way; that is sufficient for you to be without remorse. (5) You were reproved by one harboring hatred, not by one with a mind of loving-kindness; that is sufficient for you to be without remorse.' When a bhikkhu is reproved in a way contrary to the Dhamma, non-remorse should be induced in him in these five ways.

"Friends, when a bhikkhui reproves in a way contrary to the Dhamma, remorse should be induced in him in five ways: (1) 'Friend, you reproved him at an improper time, not at a proper time; that is sufficient for you to feel remorse. (2) You reproved him falsely, not truthfully; that is sufficient for you to feel remorse. (3) You reproved him harshly, not gently; that is sufficient for you to feel remorse. (4) You reproved him in a harmful way, not in a beneficial way; that is sufficient for you to feel remorse. (5) You reproved him while harboring hatred, not with a mind of loving-kindness; that is sufficient for you to feel remorse.' When a bhikkhu reproves in a way contrary to the Dhamma, remorse should be induced in him in these five ways. For what reason? So that another bhikkhu would not think of reproving falsely.

"Friends, when a bhikkhu is reproved in accordance with the Dhamma, remorse should be induced in him in five ways: (1) 'Friend, you were reproved at a proper time, not at an improper time; that is sufficient for you to feel remorse.

"Friends, when a bhikkhu reproves in accordance with the Dhamma, non-remorse should be induced in him in five ways: (1) 'Friend, you reproved him at a proper time, not at an improper time; that is sufficient for you to be without remorse.

(5) You reproved him with a mind of loving-kindness, not while harboring hatred; that is sufficient for you to be without remorse.' When a bhikkhu reproves in accordance with the Dhamma, non-remorse should be induced in him in these five ways. For what reason? So that another bhikkhu would think of reproving about what is true.

"Friends, a person who is reproved should be established in two things: in truth and non-anger. If others should reprove me-whether at a proper time or at an improper time; whether about what is true or about what is false; whether gently or harshly; whether in a beneficial way or in a harmful way; whether with a mind of loving-kindness or while harboring
hatred-I should still be established in two things: in truth and non-anger.

"If I know: 'There is such a quality in me,' I tell him: 'It exists. This quality is found in me.' If I know: 'There is no such quality in me,' I tell him: 'It doesn't exist. This quality isn't found in me.'

[The Blessed One said:] "Sariputta, even when you are speaking to them in such a way, some foolish men here do not respectfully accept what you say."

"There are, Bhante, persons devoid of faith who have gone forth from the household life into homelessness, not [199] out of faith but intent on earning a living; they are crafty, hypocritical, deceptive, restless, puffed up, vain, talkative, rambling in their talk, unguarded over the doors of the senses, immoderate in eating, not intent on wakefulness, indifferent to the ascetic life, not keenly respectful of the training, luxurious and lax, leaders in backsliding, discarding the duty of solitude, lazy, devoid of energy, muddle-minded, lacking in clear comprehension, unconcentrated, with wandering minds, unwise, stupid. When I speak to them in such a way, they do not respectfully accept what I say.

"But, Bhante, there are clansmen who have gone forth from the household life into homelessness out of faith, who are not crafty, hypocritical, deceptive, restless, puffed up, vain, talkative, and rambling in their talk; who keep guard over the doors of the senses; who are moderate in eating, intent on wakefulness, intent upon the ascetic life, keenly respectful of the training; who are not luxurious and lax; who discard backsliding and take the lead in solitude; who are energetic, resolute, mindful, clearly comprehending, concentrated, with one-pointed minds, wise, intelligent. When I speak to them in such a way, they respectfully accept what I say."

"Sāriputta, leave alone those people who are devoid of faith and have gone forth from the household life into homelessness, not out of faith but intent on earning a living; who are crafty . . . unwise, stupid. But, Sariputta, you should speak to those clansmen who have gone forth from the household life into homelessness out of faith, who are not crafty ... who are wise, intelligent. [200] Exhort your fellow monks, Sāriputta! Instruct your fellow monks, Sāriputta, [thinking:] 'I will cause
my fellow monks to emerge from what is contrary to the good Dhamma and will establish them in the good Dhamma.' Thus, Sāriputta, should you train yourself."

# 168 (8) Virtuous Behavior

[This sutta is identical with 5:24, except that it is spoken by Sāriputta to the bhikkhus.] [201]

## 169 (9) Of Quick Apprehension

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said: "In what way, friend Sāriputta, is a bhikkhu one of quick apprehension conceming wholesome teachings, one who grasps well what he has learned, learns abundantly, and does not forget what he has learned?"

"The Venerable Ānanda is learned, so let him clear this up himself."

"Then listen, friend Sāriputta, and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, friend," the Venerable Sāriputta replied. The Venerable Ānanda said this:

"Here, friend Sāriputta, a bhikkhu is skilled in meaning, skilled in the Dhamma, skilled in language, skilled in phrasing, and skilled in sequence. [^1166] In this way, friend Sāriputta, a bhikkhu is one of quick apprehension concerning wholesome teachings, one who grasps well what he has learned, learns abundantly, and does not forget what he has learned."

"It's astounding and amazing, friend, how well this has been stated by the Venerable Ānanda! We consider the Venerable Ānanda to be one who possesses these five qualities: 'The Venerable Ānanda is skilled in meaning, skilled in Dhamma, skilled in language, skilled in phrasing, and skilled in sequence.'" [202]

## 170 (10) Bhaddaji

On one occasion the Venerable Ānanda was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita's Park. Then the Venerable Bhaddaji approached the Venerable Ānanda and exchanged greetings with him. When
they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side. The Venerable Ānanda then said to him:

"Friend Bhaddaji, what is the foremost of sights? What is the foremost kind of hearing? What is the foremost happiness? What is the foremost perception? What is the foremost among states of existence?"

"(1) There is, friend, Brahmā, the vanquisher, the unvanquished, the universal seer, the wielder of power. Getting to see Brahmā is the foremost sight. (2) There are the devas of streaming radiance who are suffused and inundated with happiness. They sometimes utter the inspired utterance: 'Oh, what happiness! Oh, what happiness!' Getting to hear that sound is the foremost kind of hearing. (3) There are the devas of refulgent glory. Being happy, they experience very peaceful happiness: [^1167] this is the foremost happiness. (4) There are the devas of the base of nothingness: this is the foremost perception. (5) There are the devas of the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception: this is the foremost state of existence."

"Then does the Venerable Bhaddaji agree with the multitude about this?"1168

"The Venerable Ānanda is learned, so let him clear this up himself."

"Then listen, friend Bhaddaji, and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, friend," the Venerable Bhaddaji replied. The Venerable Ānanda said this:

"(1) In whatever way, friend, one sees such that immediately afterward the destruction of the taints occurs: [^1169] this is the foremost sight. (2) In whatever way one hears such that immediately afterward the destruction of the taints occurs: this is the foremost kind of hearing. (3) In whatever way one is happy such that immediately afterward the destruction of the taints occurs: this is the foremost happiness. (4) In whatever way one perceives such that immediately afterward the destruction of the taints occurs: this is the foremost perception. (5) In whatever way one exists such that immediately afterward the destruction of the taints occurs: this is the foremost state of existence." [203]

# III. The Lay Follower

## 171 (1) Timidity

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a lay follower is overcome by timidity. What five? He destroys life, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, speaks falsely, and indulges in liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Possessing these five qualities, a lay follower is overcome by timidity.

"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a lay follower is selfconfident. What five? He abstains from the destruction of life, abstains from taking what is not given, abstains from sexual misconduct, abstains from false speech, abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Possessing these five qualities, a lay follower is self-confident."

## 172 (2) Self-Confidence

"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a lay follower dwells without self-confidence at home. What five? [204] He destroys life, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, speaks falsely, and indulges in liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Possessing these five qualities, a lay follower dwells without self-confidence at home.

"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a lay follower dwells self-confident at home. What five? He abstains from the destruction of life, abstains from taking what is not given, abstains from sexual misconduct, abstains from false speech, abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Possessing these five qualities, a lay follower dwells self-confident at home."

## 173 (3) Hell

"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a lay follower is deposited in hell as if brought there. What five? He destroys life, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, speaks
falsely, and indulges in liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Possessing these five qualities, a lay follower is deposited in hell as if brought there.

"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a lay follower is deposited in heaven as if brought there. What five? He abstains from the destruction of life, abstains from taking what is not given, abstains from sexual misconduct, abstains from false speech, abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Possessing these five qualities, a lay follower is deposited in heaven as if brought there."

# 174 (4) Enmities

Then the householder Anāthapindika approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Householder, without having abandoned five perils and enmities, one is called immoral and is reborn in hell. What five? The destruction of life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech, and [indulging in] liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. [205] Without having abandoned these five perils and enmities, one is called immoral and is reborn in hell.

"Householder, having abandoned five perils and enmities, one is called virtuous and is reborn in heaven. What five? The destruction of life ... and [indulging in] liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Having abandoned these five perils and enmities, one is called virtuous and is reborn in heaven.

(1) "Householder, one who destroys life thereby engenders peril and enmity pertaining to the present life and the future life, and also experiences mental pain and dejection. One who abstains from the destruction of life does not engender peril and enmity pertaining to the present life and the future life, nor does he experience mental pain and dejection. For one who abstains from the destruction of life, that peril and enmity has thus subsided.

(2) "Householder, one who takes what is not given... (3) ... engages in sexual misconduct... (4) ... speaks falsely... (5) ... indulges in liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, thereby engenders peril and enmity pertaining to
the present life and the future life, and also experiences mental pain and dejection. One who abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, does not engender peril and enmity pertaining to the present life and the future life, nor does he experience mental pain and dejection. For one who abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, that peril and enmity has thus subsided."

There's a man in the world who destroys life, speaks falsely, and takes what is not given, who goes to the wives of others, and indulges in liquor and wine.

Harboring within the five enmities, he is called immoral.

With the breakup of the body, that unwise person is reborn in hell.

But there is a man in the world who does not destroy life, speak falsely, take what is not given, go to the wives of others, [206] or indulge in liquor and wine.

Having abandoned the five enmities, he is called virtuous.

With the breakup of the body, that wise person is reborn in heaven.

# 175 (5) Candaala

"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a lay follower is a candāla of a lay follower, a stain of a lay follower, the last among lay followers. [^1170] What five? (1) He is devoid of faith; (2) he is immoral; (3) he is superstitious and believes in auspicious signs, not in kamma; (4) he seeks outside here for a person worthy of offerings; [^1171] and (5) he first does [meritorious] deeds there. Possessing these five qualities, a lay follower is a candāla of a lay follower, a stain of a lay follower, the last among lay followers.

"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a lay follower is a gem of a lay follower, a red lotus of a lay follower, a white lotus of a
lay follower. [^1172] What five? (1) He is endowed with faith; (2) he is virtuous; (3) he is not superstitious and believes in kamma, not in auspicious signs; (4) he does not seek outside here for a person worthy of offerings; and he first does [meritorious] deeds here. Possessing these five qualities, a lay follower is a gem of a lay follower, a red lotus of a lay follower, a white lotus of a lay follower."

# 176 (6) Räptüre

Then the householder Anāthapindika, accompanied by five hundred lay followers, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to the householder Anāthapindika [and his retinue]:

"Householders, you have presented robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick to the Sangha of bhikkhus. You should not be content merely with this much, [thinking]: 'We have presented robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick to the Sangha of bhikkhus.' Therefore, householders, you should train yourselves thus: [207] 'How can we from time to time enter and dwell in the rapture of solitude? [^1173] It is in such a way that you should train yourselves."

When this was said, the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Blessed One: "It's astounding and amazing, Bhante, how well that was said by the Blessed One. Bhante, whenever a noble. disciple enters and dwells in the rapture of solitude, on that occasion five things do not occur in him. (1) Pain and dejection connected with sensuality do not occur in him. (2) Pleasure and joy connected with sensuality do not occur in him. (3) Pain and dejection connected with the unwholesome do not occur in him. (4) Pleasure and joy connected with the unwholesome do not occur in him. (5) Pain and dejection connected with the wholesome do not occur in him. Bhante, whenever a noble disciple enters and dwells in the rapture of solitude, on that occasion these five things do not occur in him."

"Good, good, Sāriputta! Sāriputta, whenever [208] a noble disciple enters and dwells in the rapture of solitude... [The Buddha repeats in full the entire statement of the Venerable Sāriputta, down to:] ... on that occasion these five things do not occur in him."

# 177 (7) Trades

"Bhikkhus, a lay follower should not engage in these five trades. What five? Trading in weapons, trading in living beings, trading in meat, trading in intoxicants, and trading in poisons. A lay follower should not engage in these five trades."

## 178 (8) Kings

(1) "Bhikkhus, what do you think? Have you ever seen or heard that when a person abandons and abstains from the destruction of life, kings have him arrested on the charge of so abstaining and then execute him, imprison him, banish him, or do with him as the occasion demands?"

"Surely not, Bhante."

"Good, bhikkhus! I too have not seen or heard of such a thing. But rather [209] it is when they inform kings of his evil deed, saying: 'This person has taken the life of a woman or a man,' that kings have him arrested on the charge of taking life and then execute him, imprison him, banish him, or do with him as the occasion demands. Have you ever seen or heard of such a case?"

"We have seen this, Bhante, and we have heard of it, and we will hear of it [in time to come]."

(2) "Bhikkhus, what do you think? Have you ever seen or heard that when a person abandons and abstains from taking what is not given, kings have him arrested on the charge of so abstaining and then execute him, imprison him, banish him, or do with him as the occasion demands?"

"Surely not, Bhante."

"Good, bhikkhus! I too have not seen or heard of such a thing. But rather it is when they inform kings of his evil deed, saying: 'This person has stolen something from the village or forest,' that kings have him arrested on the charge of stealing and then execute him, imprison him, banish him, or do with him as the occasion demands. Have you ever seen or heard of such a case?"

"We have seen this, Bhante, and we have heard of it, and we will hear of it [in time to come]."

(3) "Bhikkhus, what do you think? Have you ever seen or heard that when a person abandons and abstains from sexual misconduct, kings have him arrested on the charge of so
abstaining and then execute him, imprison him, banish him, or do with him as the occasion demands?"

"Surely not, Bhante."

"Good, bhikkhus! I too have not seen or heard of such a thing. [210] But rather it is when they inform kings of his evil deed, saying: 'This man has committed misconduct with someone else's women and girls,' that kings have him arrested on the charge of sexual misconduct and then execute him, imprison him, banish him, or do with him as the occasion demands. Have you ever seen or heard of such a case?"

"We have seen this, Bhante, and we have heard of it, and we will hear of it [in time to come]."

(4) "Bhikkhus, what do you think? Have you ever seen or heard that when a person abandons and abstains from false speech, kings have him arrested on the charge of so abstaining and then execute him, imprison him, banish him, or do with him as the occasion demands?"

"Surely not, Bhante."

"Good, bhikkhus! I too have not seen or heard of such a thing. But rather it is when they inform kings of his evil deed, saying: 'This person has ruined a householder or a householder's son with false speech,' that kings have him arrested on the charge of false speech and then execute him, imprison him, banish him, or do with him as the occasion demands. Have you ever seen or heard of such a case?"

"We have seen this, Bhante, and we have heard of it, and we will hear of it [in time to come]."

(5) "Bhikkhus, what do you think? Have you ever seen or heard that when a person abandons and abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, kings have him arrested on the charge of so abstaining and then execute him, imprison him, banish him, or do with him as the occasion demands?"

"Surely not, Bhante."

"Good, bhikkhus! I too have not seen or heard of such a thing. [211] But rather it is when they inform kings of his evil deed, saying: 'This person, under the influence of liquor, wine, and intoxicants, has taken the life of a woman or a man; or he has stolen something from a village or a forest; or he has committed misconduct with someone else's women and girls; or he
has ruined a householder or a householder's son with false speech,' that kings have him arrested on the charge of using liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, and then execute him, imprison him, banish him, or do with him as the occasion demands. Have you ever seen or heard of such a case?"

"We have seen this, Bhante, and we have heard of it, and we will hear of it [in time to come]."

# 179 (9) A Layman

Then the householder Anāthapindika, accompanied by five hundred lay followers, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then addressed the Venerable Sāriputta: "You should know, Sāriputta, that any white-robed householder whose actions are restrained by five training rules and who gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, four pleasant visible dwellings that pertain to the higher mind, might, if he so wished, declare of himself: 'I am finished with hell, the animal realm, and the sphere of afflicted spirits; I am finished with the plane of misery, the bad destination, the lower world; I am a stream-enterer, no longer subject to [rebirth in] the lower world, fixed in destiny, heading for enlightenment.'

(1) "What are the five training rules by which his actions are restrained? [212] Here, Sāriputta, a noble disciple abstains from the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. His actions are restrained by these five training rules.

"What are the four pleasant visible dwellings that pertain to the higher mind, which he gains at will, without trouble or difficulty?

(2) "Here, the noble disciple possesses unwavering confidence in the Buddha thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' This is the first pleasant visible dwelling that pertains to the higher mind, which he has achieved for the purification of the impure mind, for the cleansing of the unclean mind.
(3) "Again, the noble disciple possesses unwavering confidence in the Dhamma thus: 'The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.' This is the second pleasant visible dwelling that pertains to the higher mind, which he has achieved for the purification of the impure mind, for the cleansing of the unclean mind.

(4) "Again, the noble disciple possesses unwavering confidence in the Sangha thus: 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is practicing the good way, practicing the straight way, practicing the true way, practicing the proper way; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individual-this Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.' This is the third pleasant visible dwelling that pertains to the higher mind, which he has achieved [213] for the purification of the impure mind, for the cleansing of the unclean mind.

(5) "Again, the noble disciple possesses the virtuous behavior loved by the noble ones, unbroken, flawless, unblemished, unblotched, freeing, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading to concentration. This is the fourth pleasant visible dwelling that pertains to the higher mind, which he has achieved for the purification of the impure mind, for the cleansing of the unclean mind.

"These are the four pleasant visible dwellings that pertain to the higher mind, which he gains at will, without trouble or difficulty.

"You should know, Sāriputta, that any white-robed householder whose actions are restrained by these five training rules and who gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, these four pleasant visible dwellings that pertain to the higher mind, might, if he so wished, declare of himself: 'I am finished with hell, the animal realm, and the sphere of afflicted spirits; I am finished with the plane of misery, the bad destination, the lower world; I am a stream-enterer, no longer subject to [rebirth in] the lower world, fixed in destiny, heading for enlightenment.'"

Having seen the peril in the hells, one should avoid evil deeds;
having undertaken the noble Dhamma, the wise one should avoid them.

To the utmost of one's ability, one should not injure living beings; one should not knowingly speak falsely; one should not take what is not given.

One should be content with one's own wives, [^1174] and should refrain from the wives of others. [^1175] A person should not drink wine and liquor, which cause mental confusion.

One should recollect the Buddha and ponder on the Dhamma.

One should develop a benevolent mind, which leads to the world of the devas.

When things to be given are available, for one needing and wanting merit [^1176] an offering becomes vast if first given to the holy ones.

I will describe the holy ones, Sāriputta, listen to me. [^1177] [214] Among cattle of any sort, whether black, white, red, or golden, mottled, uniform, or pigeon-colored, the tamed bull is born, the one that can bear the load, possessing strength, advancing with good speed. They yoke the burden just to him; they are not concerned about his color. So too, among human beings it is in any kind of birthamong khattiyas, brahmins, vessas, suddas, candālas, or scavengersamong people of any sort that the tamed person of good manners is born: one firm in Dhamma, virtuous in conduct, truthful in speech, endowed with moral shame;
one who has abandoned birth and death, consummate in the spiritual life, with the burden dropped, detached, who has done his task, free of taints; who has gone beyond all things [of the world] and by non-clinging has reached nibbāna: an offering is truly vast when planted in that spotless field.

Fools devoid of understanding, dull-witted, unlearned, do not attend on the holy ones but give their gifts to those outside. Those, however, who attend on the holy ones, on the wise ones esteemed as sagely, and those whose faith in the Fortunato One is deeply rooted and well established, go to the world of the devas or are born here in a good family. Advancing in successive steps, those wise ones attain nibbāna.

# 180.(10) Gavesi

On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Sangha of bhikkhus. Then, while traveling along the highway, the Blessed One saw a large sal-tree grove in a certain place. He left the highway, entered the sal-tree grove, and smiled when he reached a certain place.

Then it occurred to the Venerable Ānanda: "Why did the Blessed One smile? Tathāgatas do not smile without a reason." Then the Venerable Ānanda [215] said to the Blessed One: "Why, Bhante, did the Blessed One smile? Tathāgatas do not smile without a reason."

"In the past, Ānanda, in this place there was an affluent, prosperous, well-populated city, one teeming with people. Now the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One Kassapa lived in dependence on that city. The Blessed One Kassapa had a lay follower named Gavesi who had not fulfilled virtuous behavior. And Gavesi taught and guided five hundred lay followers who had not fulfilled virtuous behavior.

(1) "Then, Ānanda, it occurred to Gavesi: 'I am the benefactor,
the leader, and the guide of these five hundred lay followers, yet neither I myself nor these five hundred lay followers have fulfilled virtuous behavior. Thus we are on the same level, and I am not the least bit better. Let me surpass them.'

"Then Gavesī approached the five hundred lay followers and said to them: 'From today on, you should consider me to be one fulfilling virtuous behavior.' Then it occurred to those five hundred lay followers: 'Master Gavesī is our benefactor, leader, and guide. Now Master Gavesī will fulfill virtuous behavior. Why shouldn't we do so too?'

"Then those five hundred lay followers approached Gavesī and said to him: 'From today onward let Master Gavesī consider us to be fulfilling virtuous behavior:'

(2) "Then, Ānanda, it occurred to the lay follower Gavesī: 'I am the benefactor, leader, and guide of these five hundred lay followers. Now I am fulfilling virtuous behavior, and so too are these five hundred lay followers. [216] Thus we are on the same level, and I am not the least bit better. Let me surpass them.'

"Then Gavesī approached the five hundred lay followers and said to them: 'From today on, you should consider me to be celibate, living apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the common person's practice.' Then it occurred to those five hundred lay followers: 'Master Gavesī is our benefactor, leader, and guide. Now Master Gavesī will be celibate, living apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the common person's practice. Why shouldn't we do so too?'

"Then those five hundred lay followers approached Gavesi and said to him: 'From today onward let Master Gavesī consider us to be celibate, living apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the common person's practice.'

(3) "Then, Ānanda, it occurred to the lay follower Gavesī: 'I am the benefactor, leader, and guide of these five hundred lay followers. Now I am fulfilling virtuous behavior, and so too are these five hundred lay followers. I am celibate, living apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the common person's practice, and so too are these five hundred lay followers. Thus we are on the same level, and I am not the least bit better. Let me surpass them.'

"Then Gavesī approached the five hundred lay followers and said to them: 'From today on, you should consider me to be eat-
ing once a day, refraining from a night meal, abstaining from eating outside the proper time.' Then it occurred to those five hundred lay followers: 'Master Gavesī is our benefactor, leader, and guide. Now Master Gavesī eats once a day, refraining from a night meal, abstaining from eating outside the proper time. Why shouldn't we do so too?'

"Then those five hundred lay followers approached Gavesī and [217] said to him: 'From today onward let Master Gavesī consider us to be eating once a day, refraining from a night meal, abstaining from eating outside the proper time.'

(4) "Then, Ānanda, it occurred to the lay follower Gavesī: 'I am the benefactor, leader, and guide of these five hundred lay followers. Now I am fulfilling virtuous behavior, and so too are these five hundred lay followers. I am celibate, living apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the common person's practice, and so too are these five hundred lay followers. I eat once a day, refraining from a night meal, abstaining from eating outside the proper time, and so too do these five hundred lay followers. Thus we are on the same level, and I am not the least bit better. Let me surpass them.'

"Then Gavesī approached the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One Kassapa, and said to him: 'Bhante, may I obtain the going forth and full ordination under the Blessed One?' The lay follower Gavesī obtained the going forth and full ordination under the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One Kassapa. Soon after his full ordination, dwelling alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute, the bhikkhu Gavesī realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having entered upon it, he dwelled in it. He directly knew: 'Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.' And the bhikkhu Gavesī became one of the arahants.

"Then, Ānanda, it occurred to those five hundred lay followers: 'Master Gavesī is our bènefactor, leader, and guide. Now Master Gavesī, having shaved off his hair and beard and put on ochre robes, has gone forth from the household life into homelessness. Why shouldn't we do so too?'
"Then those five hundred lay followers approached the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One Kassapa, [218] and said to him: 'Bhante, may we obtain the going forth and full ordination under the Blessed One?' Then those five hundred lay followers obtained the going forth and full ordination under the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One Kassapa.

(5) "Then, Ānanda, it occurred to the bhikkhu Gavesī: 'I obtain at will, without trouble or difficulty, the unsurpassed bliss of liberation. Oh, that these five hundred bhikkhus could obtain at will, without trouble or difficulty, the unsurpassed bliss of liberation!' Then, Ānanda, dwelling each alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute, in no long time those five hundred bhikkhus realized for themselves with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having entered upon it, they dwelled in it. They directly knew: 'Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.'

"Thus, Ānanda, those five hundred bhikkhus headed by Gavesi, striving in successively higher and more sublime ways, realized the unsurpassed bliss of liberation. [^1178] Therefore, Ānanda, you should train yourselves thus: 'Striving in successively higher and more sublime ways, we will realize the unsurpassed bliss of liberation.' Thus, Ānanda, should you train yourselves." [219]

# IV. FOREST DWELLERS

## 181 (1) Forest Dwellers

"Bhikkhus, there are these five kinds of forest dwellers. What five? (1) One who becomes a forest dweller because of his dullness and stupidity; (2) one who becomes a forest dweller because he has evil desires, because he is driven by desire; [^1179] (3) one who becomes a forest dweller because he is mad and mentally deranged; (4) one who becomes a forest dweller, [thinking]: 'It is praised by the Buddhas and the Buddhas' disciples'; (5) and one who becomes a forest dweller for the sake of fewness of desires, for the sake of contentment, for the sake of eliminating
[defilements], for the sake of solitude, for the sake of simplicity. These are the five kinds of forest dwellers. One who becomes a forest dweller for the sake of fewness of desires, for the sake of contentment, for the sake of eliminating [defilements], for the sake of solitude, for the sake of simplicity, is the foremost, the best, the preeminent, the supreme, and the finest of these five kinds of forest dwellers.

"Just as, bhikkhus, from a cow comes milk, from milk comes curd, from curd comes butter, from butter comes ghee, and from ghee comes cream-of-ghee, which is reckoned the foremost of all these, so one who becomes a forest dweller for the sake of fewness of desires... for the sake of simplicity, is the foremost, the best, the preeminent, the supreme, and the finest of these five kinds of forest dwellers."

182 (2)-190(10) Wearers of Rag-Robes, Etc.

"Bhikkhus, there are these five kinds of wearers of rag-robes [^1180] . . . these five who dwell at the foot of a tree ... [220] . . . these five who dwell in a charnel ground ... these five who dwell in the open air . . . these five who observe the sitter's practice . . . these five who observe the any-bed-user's practice . . . these five who observe the one-session practice . . . these five who observe the later-food-refuser's practice... these five who observe the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl. What five? (1) One who observes the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl because of his dullness and stupidity; (2) one who observes the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl because he has evil desires, because he is driven by desire; (3) one who observes the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl because he is mad and mentally deranged; (4) one who observes the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl, [thinking]: 'It is praised by the Buddhas and Buddhas' disciples'; (5) and one who observes the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl for the sake of fewness of desires, for the sake of contentment, for the sake of eliminating [defilements], for the sake of solitude, for the sake of simplicity. These are the five who observe the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl. One who observes the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl for the sake of fewness of desires... for the sake of simplicity, is the foremost, the best, the preeminent, the supreme, and the
finest of these five who observe the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl.

"Just as, bhikkhus, from a cow comes milk, from milk comes. curd, from curd comes butter, from butter comes ghee, and from ghee comes cream-of-ghee, which is reckoned the foremost of all these, so this one who observes the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl [221] for the sake of fewness of desires... for the sake of simplicity, is the foremost, the best, the preeminent, the supreme, and the finest of these five who observe the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl."

# V. DoGs

191 (1) Dogs

"Bhikkhus, there are these five ancient brahmin practices that are now seen among dogs but not among brahmins. What five?

(1) "In the past, brahmins coupled only with brahmin women, not with non-brahmin women. But now brahmins couple with both brahmin women and non-brahmin women. Dogs, however, still couple only with female dogs, not with other female animals. This is the first ancient brahmin practice that is now seen among dogs but not among brahmins.

(2) "In the past, brahmins coupled with brahmin women only when they were in season, not out of season. But now [222] brahmins couple with brahmin women both when they are in season and out of season. Dogs, however, still couple with female dogs only when they are in season, not out of season. This is the second ancient brahmin practice that is now seen among dogs but not among brahmins.

(3) "In the past, brahmins did not buy and sell brahmin women, and they would initiate cohabitation only through mutual affection, doing so for the sake of family continuity. [^1181] But now brahmins buy and sell brahmin women, and they initiate cohabitation both through mutual affection and without mutual affection, doing so for the sake of family continuity. [^1182] Dogs, however, still do not buy and sell female dogs, and they initiate cohabitation only through mutual affection, doing so for the sake of family continuity. This is the third ancient brahmin practice that is now seen among dogs but not among brahmins.
(4) "In the past, brahmins did not store up wealth, grain, silver, and gold. But now brahmins store up wealth, grain, silver, and gold. Dogs, however, still do not store up wealth, grain, silver, and gold. This is the fourth ancient brahmin practice that is now seen among dogs but not among brahmins.

(5) "In the past, brahmins went seeking almsfood in the evening for their evening meal and in the morning for their morning meal. But now brahmins eat as much as they want until their bellies are full, and then leave taking the leftovers away. Dogs, however, still go seeking food in the evening for their evening meal and in the morning for their morning meal. This is the fifth ancient brahmin practice that is now seen among dogs but not among brahmins.

"These, bhikkhus, are the five ancient brahmin practices that are now seen among dogs but not among brahmins." [223]

# 192 (2) Dona

Then the brahmin Dona approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When he had concluded his greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One: "I have heard, Master Gotama: 'The ascetic Gotama does not pay homage to brahmins who are old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage; nor does he stand up for them or offer them a seat. [^1183] This is indeed true, for Master Gotama does not pay homage to brahmins who are old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage; nor does he stand up for them or offer them a seat. This is not proper, Master Gotama."

"Do you too claim to be a brahmin, Dona?"

"Master Gotama, if one could rightly say of anyone: 'He is a brahmin well born on both his maternal and paternal sides, of pure descent, unassailable and impeccable with respect to birth as far back as the seventh paternal generation; he is a reciter and preserver of the hymns, a master of the three Vedas with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology, and etymology, and the histories as a fifth; skilled in philology and grammar, he is fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a great man'-it is precisely of me that one might say this. For I, Master Gotama, am a brahmin well born on both his maternal and paternal sides, of pure descent, unassailable and impeccable with respect to birth as far back as the seventh paternal
generation. I am a reciter and preserver of the hymns, a master of the three Vedas with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology, and etymology, and the histories as a fifth; skilled in philology and grammar, I am fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a great man."

"Doṇa, the ancient [224] seers among the brahmin-that is, Atṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Angīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāṣeṭtha, Kassapa, and Bhagu-were the creators of the hymns and the composers of the hymns, and it is their ancient hymns, formerly chanted, declared, and compiled, that the brahmins nowadays still chant and repeat, repeating what was spoken, reciting what was recited, and teaching what was taught. Those ancient seers described these five kinds of brahmins: the one similar to Brahmā, the one similar to a deva, the one who remains within the boundary, the one who has crossed the boundary, and the candāla of a brahmin as the fifth. Which of these are you, Doṇa?"

"We do not know these five kinds of brahmins, Master Gotama. All we know is [the word] 'brahmins.' Please, let Master Gotama teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might know these five kinds of brahmins."

"Then listen, brahmin, and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, sir," the brahmin Doṇa replied. The Blessed One said this:

(1) "And how, Doṇa, is a brahmin similar to Brahmā? Here, a brahmin is well born on both his maternal and paternal sides, of pure descent, unassailable and impeccable with respect to birth as far back as the seventh paternal generation. He lives the spiritual life of virginal celibacy [^1184] for forty-eight years, studying the hymns. He then seeks a teacher's fee for his teacher solely in accordance with the Dhamma, not contrary to the Dhamma. And what, Doṇa, is the Dhamma in that case? [225] Not by agriculture, not by trade, not by raising cattle, not by archery, not by service to the king, not by a particular craft, but solely by wandering for alms without scorning the alms bowl. Having offered the teacher's fee to his teacher, he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness. [^1185] When he has gone forth, he dwells pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with lovingkindness, likewise the second quarter, the third quarter, and the
fourth quarter. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will. He dwells pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with compassion . . . with a mind imbued with altruistic joy ... with a mind imbued with equanimity, likewise the second quarter, the third quarter, and the fourth quarter. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with equanimity, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will. Having developed these four divine abodes, [^186] with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in a good destination, in the brahmā world. In this way a brahmin is similar to Brahmā.

(2) "And how, Dona, is a brahmin similar to a deva? Here, a brahmin is well born on both his maternal and paternal sides, of pure descent, unassailable and impeccable with respect to birth as far back as the seventh paternal generation. He lives the spiritual life of virginal celibacy for forty-eight years, studying the hymns. He then seeks a teacher's fee for his teacher solely in accordance with the Dhamma, not contrary to the Dhamma. And what, Dona, is the Dhamma in that case? Not by agriculture, not by trade, not by raising cattle, not by archery, not by service to the king, not by a particular craft, but solely by wandering for alms [226] without scorning the alms bowl. Having offered the teacher's fee to his teacher, he seeks a wife solely in accordance with the Dhamma, not contrary to the Dhamma. And what, Dona, is the Dhamma in that case? Not by buying and selling, [he takes] only a brahmin woman given to him by the pouring of water. He couples only with a brahmin woman, not with a khattiya woman, a vessa woman, a sudda woman, or a candāla woman, nor with a woman from a family of hunters, bamboo workers, chariot makers, or flower scavengers. He does not couple with a pregnant woman, nor with a woman who is nursing, nor with a woman out of season.

"And why, Dona, doesn't the brahmin couple with a pregnant woman? Because, if he were to couple with a pregnant woman, the little boy or girl would be born in excessive filth; therefore he does not couple with a pregnant woman. And why doesn't he couple with a woman who is nursing? Because, if he
were to couple with a woman who is nursing, the little boy or girl would drink back the foul substance; [^1187] therefore he does not couple with a woman who is nursing. Why doesn't he couple with a woman out of season? Because his brahmin wife does not serve for sensual pleasure, amusement, and sensual delight, but only for procreation. [^1188] When he has engaged in sexual activity, he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness. When he has gone forth, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states... he enters and dwells in the first jhāna . . . [as in 5:14] . . . the fourth jhāna. Having developed these four jhānas, [227] with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. In this way a brahmin is similar to a deva.

(3) "And how, Doṇa, is a brahmin one who remains within the boundary? Here, a brahmin is well born on both his maternal and paternal sides, of pure descent, unassailable and impeccable with respect to birth as far back as the seventh paternal generation. He lives the spiritual life of virginal celibacy for forty-eight years.... [all as above down to] . . . Because his brahmin wife does not serve for sensual pleasure, amusement, or sensual delight, but only for procreation. When he has engaged in sexual activity, out of attachment to his sons he remains settled on his property and does not go forth from the household life into homelessness. He stops at the boundary of the ancient brahmins but does not violate it. Since he stops at the boundary of the ancient brahmins but does not violate it, he is called a brahmin who remains within the boundary. It is in this way that a brahmin is one who remains within the boundary.

(4) "And how, Doṇa, is a brahmin one who has crossed the boundary? [228] Here, a brahmin is well born on both his maternal and paternal sides, of pure descent, unassailable and impeccable with respect to birth as far back as the seventh paternal generation. He lives the spiritual life of virginal celibacy for forty-eight years, studying the hymns. He then seeks a teacher's fee for his teacher solely in accordance with the Dhamma, not contrary to the Dhamma. And what, Doṇa, is the Dhamma in that case? Not by agriculture, not by trade, not by raising cattle, not by archery, not by service to the king, not by a particular
craft, but solely by wandering for alms without scorning the alms bowl. Having offered the teacher's fee to his teacher, he seeks a wife both in accordance with the Dhamma and contrary to the Dhamma. [He takes a wife] by buying and selling as well as a brahmin woman given to him by the pouring of water. He couples with a brahmin woman, a khattiya woman, a vessa woman, a sudda woman, and a candāla woman, and a woman from a family of hunters, bamboo workers, chariot makers, or flower scavengers. He couples with a pregnant woman, a woman who is nursing, a woman in season, and a woman out of season. His brahmin wife serves for sensual pleasure, amusement, and sensual delight, as well as for procreation. [^1189] He does not stop at the boundary of the ancient brahmins but violates it. Since he does not stop at the boundary of the ancient brahmins but violates it, he is called a brahmin who has crossed the boundary. It is in this way that a brahmin is one who has crossed the boundary.

(5) "And how, Doṇa, is a brahmin a candāla of a brahmin? Here, a brahmin is well born on both his maternal and paternal sides, of pure descent, unassailable and impeccable with respect to birth as far back as the seventh paternal generation. He [229] lives the spiritual life of virginal celibacy for forty-eight years, studying the hymns. He then seeks a teacher's fee for his teacher both in accordance with the Dhamma and contrary to the Dhamma-by agriculture, by trade, by raising cattle, by archery, by service to the king, by a particular craft, and not only [^1190] by wandering for alms without scorning the alms bowl. Having offered the teacher's fee to his teacher, he seeks a wife both in accordance with the Dhamma and contrary to the Dhamma. [He takes a wife] by buying and selling as well as a brahmin woman given to him by the pouring of water. He couples with a brahmin woman, a khattiya woman, a vessa woman, a sudda woman, and a candāla woman, and a woman from a family of hunters, bamboo workers, chariot makers, or flower scavengers. He couples with a pregnant woman, a woman who is nursing, a woman in season, and a woman out of season. His brahmin wife serves for sensual pleasure, amusement, and sensual delight, as well as for procreation. He earns his living by all kinds of work. Brahmins say to him: 'Why, sir, while claiming to be a brahmin, do you earn your living by all kinds
of work?' He answers them: 'Just as fire burns pure things and impure things yet is not thereby defiled, so too, sirs, if a brahmin earns his living by all kinds of work, he is not thereby defiled.' Since he earns his living by all kinds of work, this brahmin is called a candāla of a brahmin. It is in this way that a brahmin is a candāla of a brahmin.

"Dona, the ancient seers among the brahmin-that is, Atṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgīrasa; Bhāradvāja, [230] Vāsetṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu-were the creators of the hymns and the composers of the hymns, and it is their ancient hymns, formerly chanted, declared, and compiled, that the brahmins nowadays still chant and repeat, repeating what was spoken, reciting what was recited, and teaching what was taught. Those ancient seers described these five kinds of brahmins: the one similar to Brahmā, the one similar to a deva, the one who remains within the boundary, the one who has crossed the boundary, and the candāla of a brahmin as the fifth. Which of these are you, Dona?"

"Such being the case, Master Gotama, we do not even measure up to the candāla of a brahmin. Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the darkness so those with good eyesight can see forms. I now go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

# 193 (3) Sangārava [^1191]

Then the brahmin Sangārava approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

"Master Gotama, why is it that sometimes even those hymns that have been recited over a long period do not recur to the mind, let alone those that have not been so recited? Why is it that sometimes even those hymns that have not been recited over a long period recur to the mind, let alone those that have been so recited?"
[Why the hymns are not remembered]

(1) "Brahmin, when one dwells with a mind obsessed and oppressed by sensual lust, and one does not understand as it really is the escape from arisen sensual lust, [^1192] on that occasion one does not know and see as it really is one's own good, the good of others, and the good of both.

# 194 (4) Kāranapālī

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Now on that occasion the brahmin Kāranapālī was getting some work done for the Licchavis. [^1194] The brahmin Kāranapālī saw the brahmin Pingiyānī [237] coming in the distance and said to him:

"Where is Master Pingiyāni coming from in the middle of the day?"

"I am coming, sir, from the presence of the ascetic Gotama."1195

"What do you think of the ascetic Gotama's competence in wisdom? Do you consider him wise?"

"Who am I, sir, that I could know the ascetic Gotama's competence in wisdom? Certainly, only one like him could know his competence in wisdom!"
"You praise the ascetic Gotama with lofty praise, indeed."

"Who am I, sir, that I could praise the ascetic Gotama? Praised by those who are praised, Master Gotama is best among devas and humans!"

"What grounds do you see, Master Pingiyāni, for placing such full confidence in the ascetic Gotama?"

(1) "Just as a man who has found satisfaction in the best of tastes will no longer desire tastes of an inferior kind; so too, sir, whatever one hears of Master Gotama's Dhamma-be it discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, or amazing accounts-one will no longer yearn for the doctrines of ordinary ascetics and brahmins. [^1196]

(2) "Just as a man oppressed by hunger and weakness who receives a honey cake will enjoy a sweet, delicious taste wherever he eats of it; so too, sir, whatever one hears of Master Gotama's Dhamma-discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, or amazing accounts-one will obtain satisfaction and placidity of mind.

(3) "Just as a man who comes upon a piece of sandalwood, whether yellow sandalwood or red sandalwood, will enjoy a pure, fragrant scent wherever he smells it, be it at the bottom, the middle, or the top [238]; so too, sir, whatever one hears of Master Gotama's Dhamma-discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, or amazing accounts-one will derive elation and joy.

(4) "Just as a capable physician might instantly cure one who is afflicted, sick, and gravely ill; so too, sir, whatever one hears of Master Gotama's Dhamma-discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, or amazing accounts-one's sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish will vanish.

(5) "Just as there might be a delightful pond with pleasant banks, its water clear, agreeable, cool, and limpid, and a man oppressed and exhausted by the heat, fatigued, parched, and thirsty, might come by, enter the pond, and bathe and drink; thus all his affliction, fatigue, and feverish burning would subside. So too, sir, whatever one hears of Master Gotama's Dhamma-discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, or amazing accounts-all one's affliction, fatigue, and feverish burning subside."

When this was said, the brahmin Kāranapālī rose from his
seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, and placing his right knee on the ground, he reverently saluted the Blessed One and uttered three times these inspired words:

"Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One! Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One! Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One!

"Excellent, Master Pingiyānī! Excellent, Master Pingiyāni! Master Pingiyānī has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, [239] or holding up a lamp in the darkness so those with good sight can see forms. Master Pingiyāni, I now go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus, Let Master Pingiyānī consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

# 195 (5) Pingiyānī

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Now on that occasion five hundred Licchavis were visiting the Blessed One. Some Licchavis were blue, with a blue complexion, clothed in blue, wearing blue ornaments. Some Licchavis were yellow, with a yellow complexion, clothed in yellow, wearing yellow ornaments. Some Licchavis were red, with a red complexion, clothed in red, wearing red ornaments. Some Licchavis were white, with a white complexion, clothed in white, wearing white ornaments. Yet the Blessed One outshione them all with his beauty and glory.

Then the brahmin Pingiyāni rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, and having reverently saluted the Blessed One, he said: "An inspiration has come to me, Blessed One! An inspiration has come to me, Fortunate One!"

"Then express your inspiration, Pingiyāni," the Blessed One said. [^1197] Then, in the presence of the Blessed One, the brahmin Pingiyānī extolled him with an appropriate verse: [^1198]

"As the fragrant red kokanada lotus

blooms in the morning, its fragrance unspent, behold Angirasa radiant

like the sun beaming in the sky."

Then those Licchavis presented the brahmin Pingiyāni with five hundred upper robes. The brahmin Pingiyāni presented those five hundred upper robes to the Blessed One. [240] The Blessed One then said to those Licchavis:

"Licchavis, the manifestation of five gems is rare in the world. [^1199] What five? (1) The manifestation of a Tathāgata, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One is rare in the world. (2) A person who can teach the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by a Tathāgata is rare in the world. (3) When the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by a Tathāgata has been taught, a person who can understand it is rare in the world. (4) When the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by a Tathāgata has been taught, a person who can understand it and practice in accordance with the Dhamma is rare in the world. (5) A grateful and thankful person is rare in the world. Licchavis, the manifestation of these five gems is rare in the world."

# 196 (6) Dreams

"Bhikkhus, before his enlightenment, while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened, five great dreams appeared to the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. What five?

(1) "Before his enlightenment, while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened, the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One [dreamt] that this mighty earth was his bedstead; the Himālaya, king of mountains, was his pillow; his left hand rested on the eastern sea; his right hand on the western sea, and his two feet on the southern sea. This was the first great dream that appeared to the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One before his enlightenment, while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened.

(2) "Again, before his enlightenment... the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One [dreamt] that a kind of grass called tiriyā rose up from his navel and stood touching the sky. [241] This was the second great dream that appeared to the Tathāgata... while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened.

(3) "Again, before his enlightenment... the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One [dreamt] that white worms with black heads crawled from his feet up to his knees and covered them. This was the third great dream that appeared
to the Tathāgata... while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened.

(4) "Again, before his enlightenment . . . the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One [dreamt] that four birds of different colors came from the four quarters, fell at his feet, and turned all white. This was the fourth great dream that appeared to the Tathāgata . . . while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened.

(5) "Again, before his enlightenment . . . the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One [dreamt] that he climbed up a huge mountain of dung without being soiled by it. This was the fifth great dream that appeared to the Tathāgata . . . while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened.

(1) "Now, bhikkhus, when the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One-before his enlightenment, while just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened-[dreamt] that this mighty earth was his bedstead and the Himālaya, king of mountains, his pillow; that his left hand rested on the eastern sea, his right hand on the western sea, and his two feet on the southern sea, [this was a foretoken] that he would awaken to the unsurpassed, perfect enlightenment. [^1200] This first great dream appeared to him [as a sign] that his awakening [was imminent]. [^1201] [242]

(2) "When the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One ... [dreamt] that tiriyā grass rose up from his navel and stood touching the sky, [this was a foretoken] that he would awaken to the noble eightfold path and would proclaim it well among devas and humans. This second great dream appeared to him [as a sign] that his awakening [was imminent].

(3) "When the Tathāgata, the Arahani, the Perfectly Enlightened One...[dreamt] that white worms with black heads crawled from his feet up to his knees and covered them, [this was a foretoken] that many white-robed householders would go for lifelong refuge to the Tathāgata. This third great dream appeared to him [as a sign] that his awakening [was imminent].

(4) "When the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One ... [dreamt] that four birds of different colors came from the four quarters, fell at his feet, and turned all white, [this was a foretoken] that members of the four classes-khattiyas;
brahmins, vessas, and suddas-would go forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata and realize unsurpassed liberation. This fourth great dream appeared to him [as a sign] that his awakening [was imminent].

(5) "When the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One ... [dreamt] that he climbed up a huge mountain of dung without being soiled by it, [this was a foretoken] that he would receive robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines and provisions for the sick, and he would use them without being tied to them, infatuated with them, and blindly absorbed in them, seeing the danger and knowing the escape. This fifth great dream appeared to him [as a sign] that his awakening [was imminent].

"These, bhikkhus, were the five great dreams that appeared to the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, before his enlightenment, while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened." [243]

# 199 (9) Families

"Bhikkhus; whenever virtuous monastics [^1203] come to a home, the people there generate much merit on five grounds. What five? (1) When people see virtuous monastics come to their home and they arouse hearts of confidence [toward them], on that occasion that family is practicing the way conducive to heaven. (2) When people rise, pay homage, and offer a seat to virtuous monastics who come to their home, on that occasion that family is practicing the way conducive to birth in high families. (3) When people remove the stain of miserliness toward virtuous monastics who come to their home, on that occasion that family is practicing the way conducive to great influence. (4) When, according to their means, people share what they have with virtuous monastics who come to their home, on that occasion that family is practicing the way conducive to great wealth.

[245] Bhikkhus, whenever virtuous monastics come to a home, the people there generate much merit on these five grounds."

## 200 (10) Escape

"Bhikkhus, there are these five elements of escape. [^1204] What five?

(1) "Here, when a bhikkhu is attending to sensual pleasures, [^1205] his mind does not launch out upon them, and become placid, settled, and focused on them. [^1206] But when he is attending to renunciation, his mind launches out upon it and becomes placid, settled, and focused on it. His mind is well departed, [^1207] well developed, well emerged, well liberated, and well detached from sensual pleasures. And he is freed from those taints, dis-
tressful and feverish, that arise with sensual pleasures as condition. He does not feel that kind of feeling. [^1208] This is declared to be the escape from sensual pleasures.

(2) "Again, when a bhikkhu is attending to ill will, his mind does not launch out upon it, and become placid, settled, and focused on it. But when he is attending to good will, his mind launches out upon it and becomes placid, settled, and focused on it. His mind is well departed, well developed, well emerged, well liberated, and well detached from ill will. And he is freed from those taints, distressful and feverish, that arise with ill will as condition. He does not feel that kind of feeling. This is declared to be the escape from ill will.

(3) "Again, when a bhikkhu is attending to harming, his mind does not launch out upon it and become placid, settled, and focused on it. But when he is attending to non-harming, his mind launches out upon it and becomes placid, settled, and focused on it. His mind is well departed, well developed, well emerged, well liberated, and well detached from harming. And he is freed from those taints, distressful and feverish, that arise with harming as condition. He does not feel that kind of feeling. This is declared to be the escape from harming. [246]

(4) "Again, when a bhikkhu is attending to form, his mind does not launch out upon it and become placid, settled, and focused on it. But when he is attending to the formless, his mind launches out upon it and becomes placid, settled, and focused on it. His mind is well departed, well developed, well emerged, well liberated, and well detached from form. And he is freed from those taints, distressful and feverish, that arise with form as condition. He does not feel that kind of feeling. This is declared to be the escape from form.

(5) "Again, when a bhikkhu is attending to personal existence, his mind does not launch out upon it and become placid, settled, and focused on it. But when he is attending to the cessation of personal existence, his mind launches out upon it and becomes placid, settled, and focused on it. His mind is well departed, well developed, well emerged, well liberated, and well detached from personal existence. And he is freed from those taints, distressful and feverish, that arise with personal existence as condition. He does not feel that feeling. This is declared to be the escape from personal existence.

"Delight in sensual pleasures does not lie within him; delight
in ill will does not lie within him; delight in harming does not lie within him; delight in form does not lie within him; delight in personal existence does not lie within him. Because he is without the underlying tendencies toward delight in sensual pleasures, delight in ill will, delight in harming, delight in form, and delight in personal existence, he is called a bhikkhu devoid of underlying tendencies. He has cut off craving, stripped off the fetter, and by completely breaking through conceit, he has made an end of suffering. These, bhikkhus, are the five elements of escape." [247]

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kimbila in a nicula grove. [^1209] Then the Venerable Kimbila approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:
