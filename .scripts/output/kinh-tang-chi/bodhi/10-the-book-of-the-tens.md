## 1 (1) What Purpose?

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

(1) "Bhante, what is the purpose and benefit of wholesome virtuous behavior?"

(2) "Ānanda, the purpose and benefit of wholesome virtuous behavior is non-regret."

(3) "And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of nonregret?"

"The purpose and benefit of non-regret is joy."

(4) "And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of joy?"

"The purpose and benefit of joy is rapture."

(5) "And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of rapture?"

"The purpose and benefit of rapture is tranquility."

(6) "And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of tranquility?"

"The purpose and benefit of tranquility is pleasure."

(7) "And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of pleasure?"

"The purpose and benefit of pleasure [2] is concentration."
(8) "And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of concentration?"

"The purpose and benefit of concentration is the knowledge and vision of things as they really are."

(9) "And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of the knowledge and vision of things as they really are?"

"The purpose and benefit of the knowledge and vision of things as they really are is disenchantment and dispassion."

(10) "And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of disenchantment and dispassion?"

"The purpose and benefit of disenchantment and dispassion is the knowledge and vision of liberation.

"Thus, Ānandá, (1)-(2) the purpose and benefit of wholesome virtuous behavior is non-regret; (3) the purpose and benefit of non-regret is joy; (4) the purpose and benefit of joy is rapture; (5) the purpose and benefit of rapture is tranquility; (6) the purpose and benefit of tranquility is pleasure; (7) the purpose and benefit of pleasure is concentration; (8) the purpose and benefit of concentration is the knowledge and vision of things as they really are; (9) the purpose and benefit of the knowledge and vision of things as they really are is disenchantment and dispassion; and (10) the purpose and benefit of disenchantment and dispassion is the knowledge and vision of liberation. Thus, Ānanda, wholesome virtuous behavior progressively leads to the foremost."1964

# 2 (2) Volition

(1)-(2) "Bhikkhus, for a virtuous person, one whose behavior is virtuous, no volition need be exerted: 'Let non-regret arise in me.' It is natural [^1965] that non-regret arises in a virtuous person, one whose behavior is virtuous.

(3) "For one without regret no volition need be exerted: 'Let joy arise in me.' It is natural that joy arises in one without regret.

(4) "For one who is joyful no volition need be exerted: 'Let rapture arise in me.' It is natural that rapture arises in one who is joyful. [3]

(5) "For one with a rapturous mind no volition need be exerted: 'Let my body be tranquil.' It is natural that the body of one with a rapturous mind is tranquil.
(6) "For one tranquil in body no volition need be exerted: 'Let me feel pleasure.' It is natural that one tranquil in body feels pleasure.

(7) "For one feeling pleasure no volition need be exerted: 'Let my mind be concentrated.' It is natural that the mind of one feeling pleasure is concentrated.

(8) "For one who is concentrated no volition need be exerted: 'Let me know and see things as they really are.' It is natural that one who is concentrated knows and sees things as they really are.

(9) "For one who knows and sees things as they really are no volition need be exerted: 'Let me be disenchanted and dispassionate.' It is natural that one who knows and sees things as they really are is disenchanted and dispassionate.

(10) "For one who is disenchanted and dispassionate no volition need be exerted: 'Let me realize the knowledge and vision of liberation.' It is natural that one who is disenchanted and dispassionate realizes the knowledge and vision of liberation.

"Thus, bhikkhus, (9)-(10) the knowledge and vision of liberation is the purpose and benefit of disenchantment and dispassion; (8) disenchantment and dispassion are the purpose and benefit of the knowledge and vision of things as they really are; (7) the knowledge and vision of things as they really are is the purpose and benefit of concentration; (6) concentration is the purpose and benefit of pleasure; (5) pleasure is the purpose and benefit of tranquility; (4) tranquility is the purpose and benefit of rapture; (3) rapture is the purpose and benefit of joy; (2) joy is the purpose and benefit of non-regret; and (1) non-regret is the purpose and benefit of virtuous behavior.

"Thus, bhikkhus, one stage [4] flows into the next stage, one stage fills up the next stage, for going from the near shore to the far shore."1966

# 3 (3) Virtuous Behavior [^1967]

"Bhikkhus, (1) for an immoral person, for one deficient in virtuous behavior, (2) non-regret lacks its proximate cause. When there is no non-regret, for one deficient in non-regret, (3) joy lacks its proximate cause. When there is no joy, for one deficient in joy, (4) rapture lacks its proximate cause. When there is no rapture, for one deficient in rapture, (5) tranquility lacks
its proximate cause. When there is no tranquility, for one deficient in tranquility, (6) pleasure lacks its proximate cause. When there is no pleasure, for one deficient in pleasure, (7) right concentration lacks its proximate cause. When there is no right concentration, for one deficient in right concentration, (8) the knowledge and vision of things as they really are lacks its proximate cause. When there is no knowledge and vision of things as they really are, for one deficient in the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, (9) disenchantment and dispassion lack their proximate cause. When there is no disenchantment and dispassion, for one deficient in disenchantment and dispassion, (10) the knowledge and vision of liberation lacks its proximate cause.

"Suppose there is a tree deficient in branches and foliage. Then its shoots do not grow to fullness; also its bark, softwood, and heartwood do not grow to fullness. So too, for an immoral person, one deficient in virtuous behavior, non-regret lacks its proximate cause. When there is no non-regret . . . the knowledge and vision of liberation lacks its proximate cause.

"Bhikkhus, (1) for a virtuous person, for one whose behavior is virtuous, (2) non-regret possesses its proximate cause. When there is non-regret, for one possessing non-regret, (3) joy possesses its proximate cause. When there is joy, for one possessing joy, (4) rapture possesses its proximate cause. When there is rapture, for one possessing rapture, (5) tranquility possesses its proximate cause. When there is tranquility, for one possessing tranquility, (6) pleasure possesses its proximate cause. When there is pleasure, for one possessing pleasure, (7) right concentration possesses its proximate cause. [5] When there is right concentration, for one possessing right concentration, (8) the knowledge and vision of things as they really are possesses its proximate cause. When there is the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, for one possessing the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, (9) disenchantment and dispassion possess their proximate cause. When there is disenchantment and dispassion, for one possessing disenchantment and dispassion, (10) the knowledge and vision of liberation possesses its proximate cause.

"Suppose there is a tree possessing branches and foliage. Then its shoots grow to fullness; also its bark, softwood, and
heartwood grow to fullness. So too, for a virtuous person, one whose behavior is virtuous, non-regret possesses its proximate cause. When there is non-regret . . . the knowledge and vision of liberation possesses its proximate cause."

# 4 (4) Proximate Cause

There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus:

[Identical with 10:3, but spoken by Sāriputta.] [6]

## 5 (5) Ananda

There the Venerable Ānanda addressed the bhikkhus:

[Identical with 10:3, but spoken by Ānanda.] [7]

## 6 (6) Concentration

Then the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, could a bhikkhu obtain such a state of concentration that (1) he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth, [^1988] (2) of water in relation to water; (3) of fire in relation to fire; (4) of air in relation to air; (5) of the base of the infinity of space in relation to the base of the infinity of space; (6) of the base of the infinity of consciousness in relation to the base of the infinity of consciousness; (7) of the base of nothingness in relation to the base of nothingness; (8) of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in relation to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; (9) of this world in relation to this world; (10) of the other world in relation to the other world, but he would still be percipient?"

"He could, Ānanda."

"But how, Bhante, could he obtain such a state of concentration?" [8]

"Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu is percipient thus: 'This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, the stilling of all activities, the relinquishing of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, nibbāna. [^1969] It is in this way, Ānanda, that a bhikkhu could obtain such a state of concentration that he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth; of water in relation to water; of fire in relation to fire; of air in relation to air; of the base of the infinity of space in relation to the base of the infinity of space; of the base of the infinity of consciousness in
relation to the base of the infinity of consciousness; of the base of nothingness in relation to the base of nothingness; of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in relation to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; of this world in relation to this world; of the other world in relation to the other world, but he would still be percipient."

# 7 (7) Sāriputta

Then the Venerable Ananda approached the VenerableSāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Sāriputta:

"Friend Sāriputta, could a bhikkhu obtain such a state of concentration that (1) he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth; (2) of water in relation to water; (3) of fire in relation to fire; (4) of air in relation to air; (5) of the base of the infinity of space in relation to the base of the infinity of space; [9] (6) of the base of the infinity of consciousness in relation to the base of the infinity of consciousness; (7) of the base of nothingness in relation to the base of nothingness; (8) of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in relation to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; (9) of this world in relation to this world; (10) of the other world in relation to the other world, but he would still be percipient?"

"He could, friend Ananda."

"But how, friend Sāriputta, could he obtain such a state of concentration?"

"On one occasion, friend Ānanda, I was dwelling right here in Sāvatthī in the Blind Men's Grove. There I attained such a state of concentration that I was not percipient of earth in relation to earth; of water in relation to water; of fire in relation to fire; of air in relation to air; of the base of the infinity of space in relation to the base of the infinity of space; of the base of the infinity of consciousness in relation to the base of the infinity of consciousness; of the base of nothingness in relation to the base of nothingness; of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in relation to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; of this world in relation to this world; of the other world in relation to the other world, but I was still percipient."
"But of what was the Venerable Sāriputta percipient on that occasion?"

"One perception arose and another perception ceased in me: 'The cessation of existence is nibbāna; the cessation of existence is nibbāna. [^1970] Just as, when a fire of twigs is burning, one flame arises and another flame ceases, so one perception [10] arose and another perception ceased in me: 'The cessation of existence is nibbāna; the cessation of existence is nibbāna.' On that occasion, friend, I was percipient: 'The cessation of existence is nibbāna.'"

# 8 (8) Faith [^1971]

(1) "Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu may be endowed with faith but he is not virtuous; thus he is incomplete with respect to that factor. He should fulfill that factor, [thinking]: 'How can I be endowed with faith and also be virtuous?' But when a bhikkhu is endowed with faith and is also virtuous, then he is complete with respect to that factor.

(2) "A bhikkhu may be endowed with faith and virtuous, but he is not learned... (3) ... learned, but not a speaker on the Dhamma... (4) ... a speaker on the Dhamma, but not one who frequents assemblies... (5) ... one who frequents assemblies, but not one who confidently teaches the Dhamma to an assembly...

(9) ... one who gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life, but not one who, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it.

"Thus he is incomplete with respect to that factor. He should fulfill that factor, [thinking]: 'How can I be endowed with faith ... [11]... and also be one who, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this
very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it?'

(10) "But when a bhikkhu is (i) endowed with faith, (ii) virtuous, and (iii) learned; (iv) a speaker on the Dhamma; (v) one who frequents assemblies; (vi) one who confidently teaches the Dhamma to an assembly; (vii) an expert on the discipline; (viii) a forest-dweller who resorts to remote lodgings; (ix) one who gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhánas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life; and ( x ) one who, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it, then he is complete with respect to that factor.

"A bhikkhu who possesses these ten qualities is one who inspires confidence in all respects and who is complete in all aspects."

# 9 (9) Peaceful [^1972]

(1) "Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu may be endowed with faith but he is not virtuous... (2)...endowed with faith and virtuous, but he is not learned... (3)...learned, but not a speaker on the Dhamma... (4) ... a speaker on the Dhamma, but not one who frequents assemblies... (5) ... one who frequents assemblies, but not one who confidently teaches the Dhamma to an assembly...

(9) ... one who contacts with the body and dwells in those peaceful emancipations, transcending forms, [12] that are formless, but not one who, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it.

"Thus he is incomplete with respect to that factor. He should fulfill that factor, [thinking]: 'How can I be endowed with faith ... and also be one who, with the destruction of the taints,
has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it?'

(10) "But when a bhikkhu is (i) endowed with faith, (ii) virtuous, and (iii) learned; (iv) a speaker on the Dhamma; (v) one who frequents assemblies; (vi) one who confidently teaches the Dhamma to an assembly; (vii) an expert on the discipline; (viii) a forest-dweller who resorts to remote lodgings; (ix) one who dwells having contacted with the body those peaceful emancipations, transcending forms, that are formless; and ( x ) one who, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it, then he is complete with respect to that factor.

"A bhikkhu who possesses these ten qualities is one who inspires confidence in all respects and who is complete in all aspects." [15]

# II. Protector

## 11 (1) Lodging [^1973]

"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu who possesses five factors resorts to and uses a lodging that possesses five factors, in no long time, with the destruction of the taints, he might realize for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwell in it.

"And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu possess five factors?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is endowed with faith. He has faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.'

(2) "He is seldom ill or afflicted, possessing an even digestion that is neither too cool nor too hot but moderate and suitable for striving.
(3) "He is honest and open, one who reveals himself as he really is to the Teacher and his wise fellow monks.

(4) "He has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities.

(5) "He is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering.

"It is in this way that a bhikkhu possesses five factors.

"And how does a lodging possess five factors?

(6) "Here, the lodging is neither too far [from a place for alms] nor too close, and it possesses a means for going and returning.

(7) "During the day it is not disturbed by people and at night it is quiet and still.

(8) "There is little contact with flies, mosquitoes, wind, the burning sun, and serpents.

(9) "One dwelling in that lodging can easily obtain robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick.

(10) "In that lodging elder bhikkhus are dwelling who are learned, heirs to the heritage, [16] experts on the Dhamma, experts on the discipline, experts on the outlines. He approaches them from time to time and inquires: 'How is this, Bhante? What is the meaning of this?' Those venerable ones then disclose to him what has not been disclosed, clear up what is obscure, and dispel his perplexity about numerous perplexing points.

"It is in this way that a lodging possesses five factors.

"When a bhikkhu who possesses these five factors resorts to and uses a lodging that possesses these five factors, in no long time, with the destruction of the taints, he might realize for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwell in it."

# 12 (2) Five Factors [^1974]

"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who has abandoned five factors and possesses five factors is called, in this Dhamma and discipline, a supreme person who is consummate and has completely lived the spiritual life.

"And how has a bhikkhu abandoned five factors? Here, a
bhikkhu has abandoned sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has abandoned five factors.

"And how does a bhikkhu possess five factors? Here, a bhikkhu possesses the aggregate of virtuous behavior of one beyond training, the aggregate of concentration of one beyond training, the aggregate of wisdom of one beyond training, the aggregate of liberation of one beyond training, and the aggregate of the knowledge and vision of liberation of one beyond training. It is in this way that a bhikkhu possesses five factors.

"When a bhikkhu has abandoned these five factors and possesses these five factors, he is called, in this Dhamma and discipline, a supreme person who is consummate and complete in living the spiritual life."

When sensual desire and ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness, and doubt are totally absent in a bhikkhu; [17] when one like this possesses the virtue and concentration of one beyond training, and [similar] liberation and knowledge; possessing five factors and having removed five factors, he is truly called a consummate one in this Dhamma and discipline.

# 13 (3) Fetters

"Bhikkhus, there are these ten fetters. What ten? The five lower fetters and the five higher fetters. And what are the five lower fetters? Personal-existence view, doubt, wrong grasp of behavior and observances, sensual desire, and ill will. These are the five lower fetters. And what are the five higher fetters? Lust for form, lust for the formless, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. These are the five higher fetters. These, bhikkhus, are the ten fetters."

14 (4) Mental Barrenness [^1975]

"Bhikkhus, if any bhikkhu or bhikkhuni has not abandoned five kinds of mental barrenness and eradicated five bondages
of the mind, then, whether night or day comes, only deterioration in wholesome qualities and not growth is to be expected for this person.

"What are the five kinds of mental barrenness that he has not abandoned?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is perplexed about the Teacher, doubts him, is not convinced about him and does not place confidence in him. When a bhikkhu is perplexed about the Teacher, doubts him, is not convinced about him and does not place confidence in him, his mind does not incline to ardor, effort, perseverance, and striving. Since his mind does not incline to ardor ... [18] . . . and striving, this is the first kind of mental barrenness that he has not abandoned.

(2)-(5) "Again, a bhikkhu is perplexed about the Dhamma ... perplexed about the Sangha ...perplexed about the training... is irritated by his fellow monks', displeased with them, aggressive toward them, ill disposed toward them. When a bhikkhu is irritated by his fellow monks, displeased with them, aggressive toward them, ill disposed toward them, his mind does not incline to ardor, effort, perseverance, and striving. Since his mind does not incline to ardor... and striving, this is the fifth kind of mental barrenness that he has not abandoned.

"These are the five kinds of mental barrenness that he has not abandoned.

"What are the five bondages of the mind that he has not eradicated?

(6) "Here, a bhikkhu is not devoid of lust for sensual pleasures, not devoid of desire, affection, thirst, passion, and craving for them. When a bhikkhu is not devoid of lust for sensual pleasures, not devoid of desire, affection, thirst, passion, and craving for them, his mind does not incline to ardor, effort, perseverance, and striving. Since his mind does not incline to ardor ... and striving, this is the first bondage of the mind that he has not eradicated.

(7)-(10) "Again, a bhikkhu is not devoid of lust for the body, not devoid of desire, affection, thirst, passion, and craving for it. . . . He is not devoid of lust for form, not devoid of desire, affection, thirst, passion, and craving for it. . . . Having eaten as much as he wants until his belly is full, he is intent upon the pleasure of rest, the pleasure of sloth, the pleasure of sleep . . . he lives the spiritual life aspiring for [rebirth in] a certain order of
devas, [thinking]: 'By this virtuous behavior, observance, austerity, or spiritual life I will be a deva or one [in the retinue] of the devas.' When he lives the spiritual life aspiring for [rebirth in] a certain order of devas . . . his mind does not incline [19] to ardor, effort, perseverance, and striving. Since his mind does not incline to ardor . . . and striving, this is the fifth bondage of the mind that he has not eradicated.

"These are the five bondages of mind that he has not eradicated.

"If any bhikkhu or bhikkhuni has not abandoned these five kinds of mental barrenness and eradicated these five bondages of the mind, then, whether night or day comes, only deterioration and not growth in wholesome qualities is to be expected for that person. Just as during the dark fortnight, whether night or day comes, the moon only deteriorates in beauty, roundness, and brightness, in diameter and circumference, so too, if any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī has not abandoned these five kinds of mental barrenness . . . only deterioration . . . is to be expected for that person.

"Bhikkhus, if any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī has abandoned five kinds of mental barrenness and eradicated five bondages of the mind, [^1976] then, whether night or day comes, only growth in wholesome qualities and not deterioration is to be expected for that person.

"And what are the five kinds of mental barrenness that he has abandoned?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is not perplexed about the Teacher, does not doubt him, is convinced about him and places confidence in him. When a bhikkhu is not perplexed about the Teacher, does not doubt him, is convinced about him and places confidence in him, his mind inclines to ardor, effort, perseverance, and striving. Since his mind inclines to ardor... and striving, this is the first kind of mental barrenness that he has abandoned.

(2)-(5) "Again, a bhikkhu is not perplexed about the Dhamma . . . not perplexed about the Sangha . . . not perplexed about the training [20] . . . is not irritated by his fellow monks, is pleased with them, not aggressive toward them, well disposed toward them. When a bhikkhu is not irritated by his fellow monks...well disposed toward them, his mind inclines to ardor, effort, perseverance, and striving. Since his mind inclines
to ardor... and striving, this is the fifth kind of mental barrenness that he has abandoned.

"These are the five kinds of mental barrenness that he has abandoned.

"What are the five bondages of the mind that he has well eradicated?

(6) "Here, a bhikkhu is devoid of lust for sensual pleasures, devoid of desire, affection, thirst, passion, and craving for them. When a bhikkhu is devoid of lust for sensual pleasures, devoid of desire, affection, thirst, passion, and craving for them, his mind inclines to ardor, effort, perseverance, and striving. Since his mind inclines to ardor . . . and striving, this is the first bondage of the mind that he has well eradicated.

(7)-(10) "Again, a bhikkhu is devoid of lust for the body, devoid of desire, affection, thirst, passion, and craving for it. . . He is devoid of lust for form, devoid of desire, affection, thirst, passion, and craving for it. . . . He does not eat as much as he wants until his belly is full nor is he intent upon the pleasure of rest, the pleasure of sloth, the pleasure of sleep.... He does not live the spiritual life aspiring for [rebirth in] a certain order of devas, [thinking]: 'By this virtuous behavior, observance, austerity, or spiritual life I will be a deva or one [in the retinue] of the devas.' Since he does not live the spiritual life aspiring for [rebirth in] a certain order of devas ... his mind inclines to ardor, effort, perseverance, and striving. Since his mind inclines to ardor... and striving, this is the fifth bondage of the mind that he has well eradicated.

"These are the five bondages of the mind that he has well eradicated.

"If any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī has abandoned these five kinds of mental barrenness and well eradicated these five bondages of the mind, [21] then, whether night or day comes, only growth in wholesome qualities and not deterioration is to be expected for that person. Just as during the bright fortnight, whether night or day comes, the moon only increases in beauty, roundness, and brightness, in diameter and circumference, so too, if any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī has abandoned these five kinds of mental barrenness and well eradicated these five bondages of the mind, then, whether night or day comes, only growth in wholesome qualities and not deterioration is to be expected for that person."

# 15 (5) Heedfulness

(1) "Bhikkhus, to whatever extent there are beings, whether footless or with two feet, four feet, or many feet, whether having form or formless, whether percipient or non-percipient, or neither percipient nor non-percipient, the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One is declared foremost among them. [^1977] So too, all wholesome qualities are rooted in heedfulness and converge upon heedfulness and heedfulness is declared foremost among them.

(2) "Just as the footprints of all animals that roam on land fit into the footprint of the elephant, and the elephant's footprint is declared foremost among them, that is, with respect to size, so too, all wholesome qualities are rooted in heedfulness and converge upon heedfulness and heedfulness is declared foremost among them.

(3) "Just as all the rafters of a peaked house lean toward the roof peak, slope toward the roof peak, converge upon the roof peak, and the roof peak is declared foremost among them, so too, all wholesome qualities are rooted in heedfulness and converge upon heedfulness and heedfulness is declared foremost among them. [22]

(4) "Just as, of all fragrant roots, black orris is declared foremost among them, so too...

(5) "Just as, of all fragrant heartwoods, red sandalwood is declared foremost among them, so too...

(6) "Just as, of all fragrant flowers, jasmine is declared foremost among them, so too...

(7) "Just as all petty princes are the vassals of a wheel-turning monarch, and the wheel-turning monarch is declared foremost among them, so too...

(8) "Just as the radiance of all the stars does not amount to a sixteenth part of the radiance of the moon, and the radiance of the moon is declared foremost among them, so too...

(9) "Just as, in the autumn, when the sky is clear and cloudless, the sun, ascending in the sky, dispels all darkness from space as it shines and beams and radiates, so too...

(10) "Just as, whatever great rivers there are-that is, the Ganges, the Yamunā, the Aciravatī, the Sarabhū, and the Mahī-all head toward the ocean, slant, slope, and incline toward the ocean, and the ocean is declared foremost among
them, so too, all wholesome qualities are rooted in heedfulness and converge upon heedfulness and heedfulness is declared foremost among them." [23]

16 (6) Worthy of Gifts [^1978]

"Bhikkhus, these ten persons are worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What ten? The Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One; a paccekabuddha; the one liberated in both respects; the one liberated by wisdom; the body witness; the one attained to view; the one liberated by faith; the Dhamma follower; the faith follower; and the clan member. These ten persons are worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

# 17 (7) Protector (1)

"Bhikkhus, live under a protector, not without a protector. One without a protector lives in suffering. There are these ten qualities that serve as a protector. [^1979] What ten?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. Since a bhikkhu is virtuous . . trains in them, this is a quality that serves as a protector.

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and accumulates what he has learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life-such teachings as these he has learned much of, retained in mind, recited verbally, investigated mentally, and penetrated well by view. Since a bhikkhu has learned much . . . and penetrated well by view, this, too, is a quality that serves as a protector.

(3) "Again, a bhikkhu has good friends, [24] good companions, good comrades. Since a bhikkhu has good friends, good companions, good comrades, this, too, is a quality that serves as a protector.

(4) "Again, a bhikkhu is easy to correct and possesses qualities that make him easy to correct; he is patient and receives
instruction respectfully. Since a bhikkhu is easy to correct . . . and receives instruction respectfully, this, too, is a quality that serves as a protector.

(5) "Again, a bhikkhu is skillful and diligent in attending to the diverse chores that are to be done for his fellow monks; he possesses sound judgment about them in order to carry out and arrange them properly. Since a bhikkhu is skillful and diligent . . . this, too, is a quality that serves as a protector.

(6) "Again, a bhikkhu loves the Dhamma and is pleasing in his assertions, filled with a lofty joy pertaining to the Dhamma and discipline. [^1980] Since a bhikkhu loves the Dhamma ... this, too, is a quality that serves as a protector.

(7) "Again, a bhikkhu has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities. Since a bhikkhu has aroused energy... not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities, this, too, is a quality that serves as a protector. [25]

(8) "Again, a bhikkhu is content with any kind of robe, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick. Since a bhikkhu is content with any kind of . . . provisions for the sick, this, too, is a quality that serves as a protector.

(9) "Again, a bhikkhu is mindful, possessing supreme mindfulness and alertness, one who remembers and recollects what was done and said long ago. Since a bhikkhu is mindful . . . and recollects what was done and said long ago, this, too, is a quality that serves as a protector.

(10) "Again, a bhikkhu is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. Since a bhikkhu is wise . . . this, too, is a quality that serves as a protector.

"Bhikkhus, live under a protector, not without a protector. One without a protector lives in suffering. These are the ten qualities that serve as a protector."

# 19 (9) Abodes of the Noble Ones (1)

"Bhikkhus, there are these ten abodes of the noble ones in which the noble ones of the past, present, or future abide. [^1981] What ten?

"Here, a bhikkhu (1) has abandoned five factors; (2) possesses six factors; (3) has a single guard (4) and four supports; (5) has dispelled personal truths, (6) totally renounced seeking, (7) purified his intentions, (8) tranquilized bodily activity, and become (9) well liberated in mind and (10) well liberated by wisdom. These are the ten abodes of the noble ones in which the noble ones of the past, present, or future abide."

20 (10) Abodes of the Noble Ones (2)

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Kurus near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma. [30] There
the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus. . . . The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, there are these ten abodes of the noble ones in which the noble ones abide in the past, present, or future. What ten?

"Here, a bhikkhu (1) has abandoned five factors; (2) possesses six factors; (3) has a single guard (4) and four supports; (5) has dispelled personal truths, (6) totally renounced seeking, (7) purified his intentions, (8) tranquilized bodily activity, and become (9) well liberated in mind and (10) well liberated by wisdom.

(1) "And how has a bhikkhu abandoned five factors? Here, a bhikkhu has abandoned sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has abandoned five factors.

(2) "And how does a bhikkhu possess six factors? Here, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu is neither joyful nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful and clearly comprehending. Having heard a sound with the ear . . . Having smelled an odor with the nose... Having experienced a taste with the tongue... Having felt a tactile object with the body... Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, a bhikkhu is neither joyful nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful and clearly comprehending. [^1982] It is in this way that a bhikkhu possesses six factors.

(3) "And how does a bhikkhu have a single guard? Here, a bhikkhu possesses a mind guarded by mindfulness. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has a single guard.

(4) "And how does a bhikkhu have four supports? Here, having reflected, a bhikkhu uses some things, patiently endures other things, avoids still other things, and dispels still other things. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has four supports. [31]

(5) "And how has a bhikkhu dispelled personal truths? Here, whatever ordinary personal truths may be held by ordinary ascetics and brahmins-that is, 'The world is eternal' or 'The world is not eternal'; 'The world is finite' or 'The world is infinite'; 'The soul and the body are the same' or 'The soul is one thing and the body another'; 'The Tathāgata exists after death' or 'The Tathāgata does not exist after death' or 'The Tathāgata
both exists and does not exist after death' or 'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death' - a bhikkhu has discarded and dispelled them all, given them up, rejected them, let go of them, abandoned and relinquished them. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has dispelled personal truths.

(6) "And how has a bhikkhu totally renounced seeking? Here, a bhikkhu has abandoned the search for sensual pleasures and the search for existence and has allayed the search for a spiritual life. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has totally renounced seeking.

(7) "And how has a bhikkhu purified his intentions? Here, a bhikkhu has abandoned sensual intention, intention of ill will, and intention of harming. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has purified his intentions.

(8) "And how has a bhikkhu tranquilized bodily activity? Here, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has tranquilized bodily activity.

(9) "And how is a bhikkhu well liberated in mind? Here, a bhikkhu's mind is liberated from lust, hatred, and delusion. It is in this way that a bhikkhu is well liberated in mind.

(10) "And how is a bhikkhu well liberated by wisdom? [32] Here, a bhikkhu understands: 'I have abandoned lust, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising; I have abandoned hatred... abandoned delusion, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising.' It is in this way that a bhikkhu is well liberated by wisdom.

"Bhikkhus, whatever noble ones in the past abided in noble abodes, all abided in these same ten noble abodes. Whatever noble ones in the future will abide in noble abodes, all will abide in these same ten noble abodes. Whatever noble ones at present abide in noble abodes, all abide in these same ten noble abodes.

"These are the ten abodes of the noble ones in which the noble ones abide in the past, present, or future."

# III. The Great Chapter

## 21 (1) The Lion

"Bhikkhus, in the evening the lion, the king of beasts, comes out from his lair, stretches his body, surveys the four quarters all around, [33] and roars his lion's roar three times. Then he sets out in search of game. For what reason? [With the thought:] 'Let me not cause harm to small creatures that might cross my track.'

"The lion,' bhikkhus, is a designation for the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. When the Tathāgata teaches the Dhamma to an assembly, this is his lion's roar.

"Bhikkhus, there are these ten Tathāgata's powers that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he claims the place of the chief bull, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the brahma wheel. [^1983] What ten?

(1) "Here, the Tathāgata understands as it really is the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible. Since the Tathāgata understands as it really is the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible, this is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, on account of which he claims the place of the chief bull, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the brahma wheel.

(2) "Again, the Tathāgata understands as it really is the result of the undertaking of kamma past, future, and present in terms of possibilities and causes. Since the Tathāgata understands as it really is . . . the result of the undertaking of kamma . . . this too is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, on account of which he . . . sets in motion the brahma wheel.

(3) "Again, the Tathāgata understands as it really is the ways leading everywhere. [^1984] Since the Tathāgata understands as it really is the ways leading everywhere, this too is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, on account of which he . . . sets in motion the brahma wheel.

(4) "Again, the Tathāgata [34] understands as it really is the world with its numerous and diverse elements. [^1985] Since the Tathāgata understands as it really is the world with its numerous and diverse elements, this too is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, on account of which ... he sets in motion the brahma wheel.
(5) "Again, the Tathāgata understands as it really is the diversity in the dispositions of beings. [^1986] Since the Tathāgata understands as it really is the diversity in the dispositions of beings, this too is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, on account of which ... he sets in motion the brahma wheel.

(6) "Again, the Tathāgata understands as it really is the superior or inferior condition of the faculties of other beings and persons. [^1987] Since the Tathāgata understands as it really is the superior or inferior condition of the faculties of other beings and persons, this too is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, on account of which ... he sets in motion the brahma wheel.

(7) "Again, the Tathāgata understands as it really is the defilement, the cleansing, and the emergence in regard to the jhānas, emancipations, concentrations, and meditative attainments. Since the Tathāgata understands as it really is the defilement, the cleansing, and the emergence in regard to the jhānas . . . this too is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, on account of which ... he sets in motion the brahma wheel.

(8) "Again, the Tathāgata recollects his manifold past abodes, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty [35] births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many eons of world-dissolution, many eons of worldevolution, many eons of world-dissolution and world-evolution thus: 'There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere, and there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn here.' Thus he recollects his manifold past abodes with their aspects and details. Since the Tathāgata recollects his manifold past abodes . . . with their aspects and details, this too is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, on account of which ... he sets in motion the brahma wheel.

(9) "Again, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, the Tathāgata sees beings passing away and being reborn; inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma thus: 'These beings who
engaged in misconduct by body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong view, and undertook kamma based on wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; but these beings who engaged in good conduct by body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right view, and undertook kamma based on right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.' Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma. [36] Since the Tathāgata... understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma, this too is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, on account of which ... he sets in motion the brahma wheel.

(10) "Again, with the destruction of the taints, the Tathāgata has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. Since the Tathāgata has realized for himself . . . the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom... this too is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, on account of which he claims the place of the chief bull, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the brahma wheel.

"These, bhikkhus, are the ten Tathāgata's powers that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he claims the place of the chief bull, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the brahma wheel."

# 22 (2) Doctrinal Principles

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Ānanda, I claim to be confident about the things that lead to the realization by direct knowledge of the various doctrinal principles, [^1988] [and I am thus able] to teach the Dhamma to various people in various ways such that one who practices accordingly will know of what exists that it exists and of what
does not exist that it does not exist; such that one will know of the inferior that it is inferior and of the sublime that it is sublime; such that one will know of what is surpassable that it is surpassable and of what is unsurpassable that it is unsurpassable; such that [37] it is possible that one will know, see, and realize this just as it is to be known, seen, and realized.

"But among knowledges, Ānanda, this one is unsurpassed, namely, the knowledge of these things and those things as they really are. [^1989] And, I say, there is no other knowledge higher or more excellent than this.

"There are, Ānanda, these ten Tathāgata's powers that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he claims the place of the chief bull, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the brahma wheel. What ten?...

[As in 10:21] [38]...

"These, Ānanda, are the ten Tathāgata's powers that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he claims the place of the chief bull, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the brahma wheel." [39]

# 23 (3) Body

"Bhikkhus, there are things to be abandoned by body, not by speech. There are things to be abandoned by speech, not by body. There are things to be abandoned neither by body nor by speech but by having repeatedly seen with wisdom. [^1990]

"And what, bhikkhus, are the things to be abandoned by body, not by speech? Here, a bhikkhu has committed a particular unwholesome deed with the body. His wise fellow monks investigate him and say thus: 'You have committed a particular unwholesome deed with the body. It would really be good if you would abandon bodily misconduct and develop bodily good conduct.' When his wise fellow monks investigate him and speak to him, he abandons bodily misconduct and develops bodily good conduct. These are called things to be abandoned by body, not by speech.

"And what are the things to be abandoned by speech, not by body? Here, a bhikkhu has committed a particular unwholesome deed by speech. His wise fellow monks investigate him and say thus: 'You have committed a particular unwholesome deed by speech. It would really be good if you would abandon
verbal misconduct and develop verbal good conduct.' When his wise fellow monks investigate him and speak to him, he abandons verbal misconduct and develops verbal good conduct. These are called things to be abandoned by speech, not by body.

"And what are the things to be abandoned neither by body nor by speech but by having repeatedly seen with wisdom? Greed is to be abandoned neither by body nor by speech but by having repeatedly seen with wisdom. Hatred . . . Delusion . . . Anger . . . Hostility . . . Denigration . . . Insolence [40] . . . Miserliness is to be abandoned neither by body nor by speech but by having repeatedly seen with wisdom.

"Evil envy, [^1991] bhikkhus, is to be abandoned neither by body nor by speech but by having repeatedly seen with wisdom. And what is evil envy? Here, a householder or householder's son is prospering in wealth or grain, in silver or gold. A slave or dependent might think of him: 'Oh, may this householder or householder's son not prosper in wealth or grain, in silver or gold!' Or else an ascetic or brahmin gains robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick. Another ascetic or brahmin might think of him: 'Oh, may this venerable one not gain robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick!' This is called evil envy. Evil envy is to be abandoned neither by body nor by speech but by having repeatedly seen with wisdom.

"Evil desire, bhikkhus, is to be abandoned neither by body nor by speech but by having repeatedly seen with wisdom. And what is evil desire? Here, one without faith desires: 'Let them know me as one endowed with faith.' An immoral person desires: 'Let them know me as virtuous.' One with little learning desires: 'Let them know me as learned.' One who delights in company desires: 'Let them know me as solitary.' One who is lazy desires: 'Let them know me as energetic.' One who is muddle-minded desires: 'Let them know me as mindful.' One who is unconcentrated desires: 'Let them know me as concentrated.' One who is unwise desires: 'Let them know me as wise.' One whose taints are not destroyed desires: 'Let them know me as one whose taints are destroyed.' [41] This is called evil desire. Evil desire is to be abandoned neither by body nor by speech but by having repeatedly seen with wisdom.

"If, bhikkhus, greed overcomes that bhikkhu and continues
on; if hatred . . . delusion . . . anger . . . hostility . . . denigration . . . insolence . . . miserliness . . . evil envy . . . evil desire overcomes that bhikkhu and continues on, [^1992] he should be understood thus: 'This venerable one does not understand in such a way that he would have no greed; thus greed overcomes him and continues on. This venerable one does not understand in such a way that he would have no hatred . . . no delusion . . . no anger . . . no hostility . . . no denigration . . . no insolence . . . no miserliness . . . no evil envy . . no evil desire; thus evil desire overcomes him and continues on.'

"If, bhikkhus, greed does not overcome that bhikkhu and continue on; if hatred . . . delusion . . . anger . . . hostility . . denigration . . . insolence . . . miserliness . . . evil envy . . . evil desire does not overcome that bhikkhu and continue on, he should be understood thus: 'This venerable one understands in such a way that he would have no greed; thus greed does not overcome him and continue on. This venerable one understands in such a way that he would have no hatred . . . no delusion . . . no anger . . . no hostility . . . no denigration . . . no insolence . . . no miserliness . . . no evil envy . . . no evil desire; thus evil desire does not overcome him and continue on.'"

# 24 (4) Cunda

On one occasion the Venerable Mahācunda was dwelling among the Cetis at Sahajāti. There the Venerable Mahācunda addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend!" those [42] bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Mahācunda said this:

"Friends, making a declaration of knowledge, a bhikkhu says: 'I know this Dhamma, I see this Dhamma. [^1993] If, however, greed overcomes that bhikkhu and persists; [^1994] if hatred . . . delusion . . . anger . . . hostility . . . denigration . . . insolence . . . miserliness... evil envy . . . evil desire overcomes that bhikkhu and persists, he should be understood thus: 'This venerable one does not understand in such a way that he would have no greed; thus greed overcomes him and persists. This venerable one does not understand in such a way that he would have no hatred . . no delusion . . noanger . . . no hostility . . . no denigration . . . no insolence . . . no miserliness . . . no evil envy . . . no evil desire; thus evil desire overcomes him and persists.'

"Friends, making a deelaration-of-development, a bhikkhu
says: 'I am developed in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom.' If, however, greed overcomes that bhikkhu and persists; if hatred ... evil desire overcomes that bhikkhu and persists, he should be understood thus: 'This venerable one does not understand in such a way that he would have no greed; thus greed overcomes him and persists. This venerable one does not understand in such a way that he would have no hatred . . . no evil desire; thus evil desire overcomes him and persists.'

"Friends, making a declaration of knowledge and development, a bhikkhu says: 'I know this Dhamma, I see this Dhamma. I am developed in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom.' If, however, greed overcomes that bhikkhu and persists; if hatred . . evil desire [43] overcomes that bhikkhu and persists, he should be understood thus: 'This venerable one does not understand in such a way that he would have no greed; thus greed overcomes him and persists. This venerable one does not understand in such a way that he would have no hatred . . . no evil desire; thus evil desire overcomes him and persists.'

"Suppose a poor, destitute, and needy person claims to be rich, affluent, and wealthy. If, when he wants to buy something, he cannot pay with money, grain, silver, or gold, they would know him as a poor, destitute, and needy person claiming to be rich, affluent, and wealthy. For what reason? Because when he wants to buy something, he cannot pay with money, grain, silver, or gold.

"Bhikkhus, there are these ten kasina bases. [^1995] What ten? One person perceives the earth kasina above, below, across, nondual, measureless. [^1996] One person perceives the water kasina . . . the fire kasina . . . the air kasina . . . the blue kasina . . . the yellow kasina . . . the red kasina . . . the white kasina . . . the space kasina . . . the consciousness kasina above, below, across, nondual, measureless.

## 26 (6) Kālī

On one occasion the Venerable Mahākaccāna was dwelling among the people of Avantī on Mount Pavatta at Kuraraghara. Then the female lay follower Kālī of Kuraraghara approached him, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: [^1997]

"Bhante, this was said by the Blessed One in 'The Maidens' Questions' [^1998]

"'Having conquered the army of the pleasant and agreeable,

meditating alone, I discovered bliss, the attainment of the goal, the peace of the heart.

Therefore I don't form intimate ties with people, nor does intimacy with anyone get a chance with me.' [47]

"How, Bhante, is the meaning of this statement that the Blessed One spoke in brief to be seen in detail?"

"Some ascetics and brahmins; sister, for whom the attainment of the earth kasina is supreme, generated it as their goal. [^1999] The Blessed One directly knew to what extent the attainment of the earth kasina is supreme. Having directly known this, he saw the beginning, [^2000] the danger, and the escape, and he saw the knowledge and vision of the path and the non-path. By seeing the beginning, the danger, and the escape, and by seeing the knowledge and vision of the path and the non-path, he knew the attainment of the goal, the peace of the heart.

"Thus, sister, it is in such a way that the meaning should be seen in detail of this statement that the Blessed One spoke in brief in 'The Maidens' Questions':

# 27 (7) Great Questions (1).

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇ̣ika's Park. Then, in the morning, a number of bhikkhus dressed, took their bowls and robes, and entered Sāvatthī for alms. Then it occurred to those bhikkhus: "It is still too early to walk for alms in Sāvatthī. Let us go to the park of the wanderers of other sects."

Then those bhikkhus went to the park of the wanderers of other sects. They exchanged greetings with those wanderers and, when they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, sat down to one side. Those wanderers then said to them:

"Friends, the ascetic Gotama teaches the Dhamma to his disciples in such a way as this: 'Come, bhikkhus, directly know all phenomena. [^2001] Dwell having directly known all phenomena. [^2002] We too teach the Dhamma to our disciples in such a way as this: 'Come, friends, directly know all phenomena. Dwell having directly known all phenomena.' What now is the distinction,
the disparity, the difference between the ascetic Gotama's [49] teaching of the Dhamma and our teaching, between his instruction and our instruction?"

Then those bhikkhus neither applauded nor rejected the statement of those wanderers. Without applauding it, without rejecting it, they rose from their seats and left, [thinking]: "We shall find out what the Blessed One has to say about this statement."

Then, when those bhikkhus had walked for alms in Sāvatthī, after their meal, on returning from their alms round, they approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: "Here, Bhante, in the morning, we dressed, took our bowls and robes, and entered Sāvatthī for alms. ... [They here report the entire course of events, down to:] [50] We rose from our seats and left, [thinking]: 'We shall find out what the Blessed One has to say about this statement.'"

"Bhikkhus, when wanderers of other sects speak thus, they should be answered in this way: 'A question about one, a concise statement about one, an explanation of one. [^203] A question about two, a concise statement about two, an explanation of two. A question about three, a concise statement about three, an explanation of three. A question about four, a concise statement about four, an explanation of four. A question about five, a concise statement about five, an explanation of five.

A question about eight, a concise statement about eight, an explanation of eight. A question about nine, a concise statement about nine, an explanation of nine. A question about ten, a concise statement about ten, an explanation of ten. If wanderers of other sects were questioned thus, they would not be able to reply and, further, they would meet with distress. For what reason? Because that would not be within their domain. I do not see anyone, bhikkhus, in the world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, who could satisfy the mind with an answer to these questions apart from the Tathāgata or a disciple of the Tathāgata or one who has heard it from them.

Having overcome them, he is percipient thus: 'I know, I see.' This is the fifth basis of overcoming.

Seeing this thus, the instructed noble disciple becomes disenchanted with it; being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate toward the foremost, not to speak of what is inferior.

(9) "Bhikkhus, there are some ascetics and brahmins who proclaim supreme purification. [^2024] Of those who proclaim supreme purification, this is the foremost, namely, by completely surmounting the base of nothingness, one enters and dwells in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. They teach their Dhamma for the direct knowledge and realization of this. There are beings who assert thus. But even for those who assert thus, there is alteration; there is change. Seeing this thus, the instructed noble disciple becomes disenchanted with it; being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate toward the foremost, not to speak of what is inferior.

(10) "Bhikkhus, there are some ascetics and brahmins who proclaim supreme nibbāna in this very life. [^2025] Of those who proclaim supreme nibbāna in this very life, this is the foremost, namely, emancipation through non-clinging after one has seen as they really are the origin and passing away, the gratification, danger, and escape in regard to the six bases for contact.

"Bhikkhus, though I assert and declare [my teaching] in such a way, some ascetics and brahmins untruthfully, baselessly, falsely, and wrongly misrepresent me, [by saying]: 'The ascetic Gotama does not proclaim the full understanding of sensual pleasures, the full understanding of forms, or the full understanding of feelings.' [65] But, bhikkhus, I do proclaim the full understanding of sensual pleasures, the full understanding of forms, and the full understanding of feelings. In this very life, hungerless, quenched, and cooled, I proclaim final nibbāna through non-clinging. [^2026]

# 30 (10) Kosala (2)

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Now on that occasion King Pasenadi of Kosala had returned from the war front, victorious
in battle, his purpose having been achieved. [^2027] Then King Pasenadi of Kosala set out for the park. He went by carriage as far as the ground was suitable for a carriage, and then he dismounted from his carriage and entered the park on foot. Now, on that occasion a number of bhikkhus were walking back and forth in the open air. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala approached those bhikkhus and asked them:

"Bhante, where is the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One now dwelling? For I wish to see the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One."

"Great king, that is his dwelling with the closed door. Approach it quietly. Without hurrying, enter the porch, clear your throat, and tap on the bolt. The Blessed One will open the door for you."

Then, King Pasenadi of Kosala went quietly up to the dwelling with the closed door. Without hurrying, he entered the porch, cleared his throat, and tapped on the bolt. The Blessed One opened the door.

Then King Pasenadi of Kosala entered the dwelling, prostrated himself with his head at the Blessed One's feet, and covered the Blessed One's feet with kisses and caressed them with his hands, pronouncing his name: "Bhante, I am King Pasenadi of Kosala! Bhante, I am King [66] Pasenadi of Kosala!"2028

"But, great king, what reasons do you have for showing such supreme honor to this body and displaying such an offering of loving-kindness?"

"Bhante, it is out of my gratitude and thankfulness that I show such supreme honor toward the Blessed One and display such an offering of loving-kindness to him.

(1) "For, Bhante, the Blessed One is practicing for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people; he has established many people in the noble method, that is, in the way of the good Dhamma, in the way of the wholesome Dhamma. [^2029] This is one reason I show such supreme honor toward the Blessed One and display such an offering of lovingkindness to him.

(2) "Again, Bhante, the Blessed One is virtuous, of mature behavior, of noble behavior, of wholesome behavior, possessing wholesome behavior. This is another reason I show such supreme honor toward the Blessed One. . .
(3) "Again, Bhante, for a long time the Blessed One has been a forest-dweller who resorts to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves. Since that is [67] so, this is another reason I show such supreme honor toward the Blessed One....

(4) "Again, Bhante, the Blessed One is content with any kind of robe, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick. This is another reason I show such supreme honor toward the Blessed One....

(5) "Again, Bhante, the Blessed One is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. This is another reason I show such supreme honor toward the Blessed One....

(6) "Again, Bhante, the Blessed One gets to hear at will, without trouble or difficulty, talk concerned with the austere life that leads to the elimination [of defilements], that is conducive to opening up the heart, that is, talk on fewness of desires, on contentment, on solitude, on not getting bound up [with others], on arousing energy, on virtuous behavior, on concentration, on wisdom, on liberation, on the knowledge and vision of liberation. This is another reason I show such supreme honor toward the Blessed One....

(7) "Again, Bhante, the Blessed One gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life. [68] This is another reason I show such supreme honor toward the Blessed One....

(8) "Again, Bhante, the Blessed One recollects his manifold past abodes, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many eons of world-dissolution, many eons of world-evolution, many eons of world-dissolution and world-evolution thus: 'There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere, and there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn here.' Thus he recollects his
manifold past abodes with their aspects and details. Since that is so, this is another reason I show such supreme honor toward the Blessed One....

(9) "Again, Bhante, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, the Blessed One sees beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma thus: 'These beings who engaged in misconduct by body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, [69] held wrong view, and undertook kamma based on wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; but these beings who engaged in good conduct by body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right view, and undertook kamma based on right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in a good destination, in the heavenly world.' Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma. Since that is so, this is another reason I show such supreme honor toward the Blessed One....

(10) "Again, Bhante, with the destruction of the taints, the Blessed One has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. Since that is so, this is another reason I show such supreme honor toward the Blessed One and display such an offering of loving-kindness to him.

"And now, Bhante, we must be going. We are busy and have much to do."

"You may go, great king, at your own convenience."

Then King Pasenadi of Kosala rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed. [70]

# IV. UpĀLI

## 31 (1) Upāli

Then the Venerable Upāli approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, on how many grounds has the Tathāgata prescribed the training rules [^2033] for his disciples and recited the Pātimokkha?"

"It is, Upāli, on ten grounds that the Tathāgata has prescribed the training rules for his disciples and recited the Pātimokkha. What ten? (1) For the well-being of the Sangha; (2) for the ease of the Sangha; (3) for keeping recalcitrant persons in check; (4) so that well-behaved bhikkhus can dwell at ease; (5) for the restraint of taints pertaining to this present life; (6) for the dispelling of taints pertaining to future lives; (7) so that those without confidence might gain confidence; and (8) for increasing [the confidence] of those with confidence; (9) for the continuation of the good Dhamma; and (10) for promoting discipline.

"It is on these ten grounds that the Tathāgata has prescribed the training rules for his disciples and recited the Pātimokkha."

## 32 (2) Suspending [^2031]

"Bhante, how many reasons are there for suspending the Pātimokkha?"

"There are, Upāli, ten reasons for suspending the Pātimokkha. What ten? (1) One who has committed a päräjika is sitting in that assembly; (2) a discussion about one who has committed a pārā̄ika is underway; [^2032] (3) one not fully ordained is sitting in that assembly; [71] (4) a discussion about one not fully ordained is underway; (5) one who has given up the training is sitting in that assembly; (6) a discussion about one who has given up the training is underway; (7) a eunuch is sitting in that assembly; [^2033] (8) a discussion about a eunuch is underway; (9) a seducer of a bhikkhunī is sitting in that assembly; [^2034] (10) a discussion about a seducer of a bhikkhunī is underway. These are the ten reasons for suspending the Pātimokkha."

## 33 (3) Adjudication

"Bhante, how many qualities should a bhikkhu possess to be agreed upon to adjudicate [in a disciplinary issue]?"2035
"A bhikkhu who possesses ten qualities, Upāli, may be agreed upon to adjudicate [in a disciplinary issue]. What ten? (1) Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. (2) He has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and accumulates what he has learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life-such teachings as thesehe has learned much of, retained in mind, recited verbally, investigated mentally, and penetrated well by view. (3) Both Pātimokkhas have been well transmitted to him in detail, well analyzed, well mastered, well determined in terms of the rules and their detailed explication. (4) He is firm in the discipline, immovable. (5) He is able to convince those on both sides of the issue, to describe matters to them, to persuade them, to demonstrate to them, and to placate them. (6) He is skilled in the origination and [72] settlement of disciplinary issues. (7) He knows what a disciplinary issue is. [^2036] (8) He knows the origin of a disciplinary issue. (9) He knows the cessation of a disciplinary issue. (10) He knows the way leading to the cessation of a disciplinary issue. [^2077] A bhikkhu who possesses these ten qualities may be agreed upon to adjudicate [in a disciplinary issue]."

# 34 (4) Full Ordination

"Bhante, how many qualities should a bhikkhu possess to give full ordination?"

"A bhikkhu who possesses ten qualities, Upāli, may give full ordination. What ten? (1) Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous . . . he trains in them. (2) He has learned much . . . and penetrated well by view. (3) Both Pātimokkhas have been well transmitted to him in detail, well analyzed, well mastered, well determined in terms of the rules and their detailed explication. (4) He is able to look after a patient or to get someone else to look after him. (5) He is able to eliminate one's dissatisfaction or to get someone else to eliminate it. (6) He is able to use the Dhamma to dispel regrets that might arise [in his pupils]. (7) He is able to dissuade them, by way of the Dhamma, from erroneous views that have arisen. (8) He is able to encourage them in the higher virtuous
behavior. (9) He is able to encourage them in the higher mind. (10) He is able to encourage them in the higher wisdom. A bhikkhu who possesses these ten qualities may give full ordination." [73]

# 35 (5) Dependence

"Bhante, how many qualities should a bhikkhu possess to give dependence?"

"A bhikkhu who possesses ten qualities, Upāli, may give dependence. What ten?"...

[The same ten qualities as in the preceding sutta.]

"A bhikkhu who possesses these ten qualities may give dependence."

36 (6) Novice [^2038]

"Bhante, how many qualities should a bhikkhu possess to be attended upon by a novice?"

"A bhikkhu who possesses ten qualities, Upāli, may be attended upon by a novice. What ten?"...

[The same ten qualities as in 10:34.]

"A bhikkhu who possesses these ten qualities may beattended upon by a novice."

## 37 (7) Schism (1)

"Bhante, it is said: 'Schism in the Sangha, schism in the Sangha.' How, Bhante, is there schism in the Sangha?"

"Here, Upāli, (1) bhikkhus explain non-Dhamma as Dhamma, (2) and Dhamma as non-Dhamma. (3) They explain non-. discipline as discipline, [74] and (4) discipline as non-discipline. (5) They explain what has not been stated and uttered by the Tathāgata as having been stated and uttered by him, and (6) what has been stated and uttered by the Tathāgata as not having been stated and uttered by him. (7) They explain what has not been practiced by the Tathāgata as having been practiced by him, and (8) what has been practiced by the Tathāgata as not having been practiced by him. (9) They explain what has not been prescribed by the Tathāgata as having been prescribed by him, and (10) what has been prescribed by the Tathāgata as not having been prescribed by him. On these ten grounds they withdraw and go apart. They perform legal acts separately and
recite the Pātimokkha separately. It is in this way, Upāli, that there is schism in the Sangha."

38 (8) Schism (2)

"Bhante, it is said: 'Concord in the Sangha, concord in the Sangha.' How is there concord in the Sangha?"

"Here, Upāli, (1) bhikkhus explain non-Dhamma as nonDhamma, and (2) Dhamma as Dhamma. (3) They explain nondiscipline as non-discipline, and (4) discipline as discipline. (5) They explain what has not been stated and uttered by the Tathāgata as not having been stated and uttered by him, and (6) what has been stated and uttered by the Tathāgata as having been stated and uttered by him. (7) They explain what has not been practiced by the Tathāgata as not having been practiced by him, and (8) what has been practiced by the Tathāgata as having been practiced by him. (9) They explain what has not been prescribed by the Tathāgata as not having been prescribed by him, and (10) what has been prescribed by the Tathāgata as having been prescribed by him. On these ten grounds, they do not withdraw and go apart. They do not perform legal acts separately or recite the Pātimokkha separately. It is in this way, Upāli, that there is concord in the Sangha." [75]

# 39 (9) Ānanda (1)

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, it is said: 'Schism in the Sangha, schism in the Sangha.' How is there schism in the Sangha?"

"Here, Ānanda, (1) bhikkhus explain non-Dhamma as Dhamma ... [as in 10:37] . . . and (10) what has been prescribed by the Tathāgata as not having been prescribed by him. On these ten grounds they withdraw and go apart. They perform legal acts separately and recite the Pātimokkha separately. It is in this way, Ānanda, that there is schism in the Sangha. [^2039]

"But, Bhante, when one causes schism in a harmonious Sangha, what does one generate?"

"One generates evil lasting for an eon, Ānanda. [^2040]

"But, Bhante, what is that evil lasting for an eon?"

"One is tormented in hell for an eon, Ānanda." [76]

One who causes schism in the Sangha is bound for misery,

bound for hell, to abide there for an eon.

Delighting in factions, established in non-Dhamma, he falls away from security from bondage.

Having caused schism in a harmonious Sangha, he is tormented in hell for an eon.

40 (10) Ananda (2)

"Bhante, it is said: 'Concord in the Sangha, concord in the Sangha.' How is there concord in the Sangha?"

"Here, Ānanda, (1) bhikkhus explain non-Dhamma as nonDhamma... [as in 10:38]... and (10) what has been prescribed by the Tathāgata as having been prescribed by him. On these ten grounds they do not withdraw and go apart. They do not perform legal acts separately or recite the Pātimokkha separately. It is in this way, Ānanda, that there is concord in the Sangha." [^204]

"But, Bhante, when one reconciles a divided Sangha, what does one generate?"

"One generates divine merit, Ānanda."

"But, Bhante, what is divine merit?"

"One rejoices in heaven for an eon, Ānanda." [77]

Pleasant is concord in the Sangha, and the mutual help [^2042] of those who live in concord. Delighting in concord, established in Dhamma, one does not fall away from security from bondage. Having brought concord to the Sangha, one rejoices in heaven for an eon.

# V. INSULTS

41 (1) Disputes

Then the Venerable Upāli approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, why is it that arguments, quarrels, contention, and disputes arise in the Sangha and bhikkhus do not dwell at ease?"

"Here, Upāli, (1) bhikkhus explain non-Dhamma as Dhamma
... [as in 10:37]... [78]... and (10) what has been prescribed by the Tathāgata as not having been prescribed by him. This, Upāli, is why arguments, quarrels, contention, and disputes arise in the Sangha and bhikkhus do not dwell at ease."

# 42 (2) Roots (1)

"Bhante, how many roots of disputes are there?"

"There are, Upāli, ten roots of disputes. What ten? Here, (1) bhikkhus explain non-Dhamma as Dhamma... [as in 10:37]... and (10) what has been prescribed by the Tathāgata as not having been prescribed by him. These, Upāli, are the ten roots of disputes."

## 43 (3) Roots (2)

"Bhante, how many roots of disputes are there?"

"There are, Upāli, ten roots of disputes. What ten? Here, (1) bhikkhus explain what is no offense as an offense, and (2) what is an offense as no offense. (3) They explain a light offense as a grave offense, and (4) a grave offense as a light offense. (5) They explain a coarse offense as not a coarse offense, and (6) an offense that is not coarse as a coarse offense. (7) They explain a remediable offense as an irremediable offense, and (8) an irremediable offense as a remediable offense. [79] (9) They explain an offense with redress as an offense without redress, and (10) an offense without redress as an offense with redress. [^2043] These, Upāli, are the ten roots of disputes."

## 44 (4) Kusinārā

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kusinārā, in the forest thicket of oblations. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who wishes to reprove another person should examine himself with respect to five things and establish five things in himself before he reproves the other person. [^2044] With respect to what five things should he examine himself?

(1) "Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who wishes to reprove another should examine himself thus: 'Is my bodily behavior pure? Do I possess bodily behavior that is pure, flawless, and irreproach-
able? Does this quality exist in me or not?' If the bhikkhu's bodily behavior is not pure, and he does not possess bodily behavior that is pure, flawless, and irreproachable, there will be those who say to him: 'Please first train yourself bodily.' There will be those who say this to him.

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu who wishes to reprove another should examine himself thus: 'Is my verbal behavior pure? Do I possess verbal behavior that is pure, flawless, and irreproachable? Does this quality exist in me or not?' If the bhikkhu's verbal behavior is not pure, and he does not possess verbal behavior that is pure, flawless, and irreproachable, there will be those who say. to him: 'Please first train yourself verbally.' There will be those who say this to him. [80]

(3) "Again, a bhikkhu who wishes to reprove another should examine himself thus: 'Have I established a mind of lovingkindness without resentment toward my fellow monks? Does this quality exist in me or not?' If the bhikkhu has not established a mind of loving-kindness without resentment toward his fellow monks, there will be those who say to him: 'Please first establish a mind of loving-kindness toward your fellow monks.' There will be those who say this to him.

(4) "Again, a bhikkhu who wishes to reprove another should examine himself thus: 'Am I learned, and do I retain and preserve what I have learned? Have I learned much of those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life? Have I retained them in mind, recited them verbally, mentally investigated them, and penetrated them well by view? Does this quality exist in me or not?' If the bhikkhu is not learned . . . and has not penetrated them well by view, there will be those who say to him: 'Please first learn the heritage.' There will be those who say this to him.

(5) "Again, a bhikkhu who wishes to reprove another should examine himself thus: 'Have both Pātimokkhas been well transmitted to me in detail, well analyzed, well mastered, well determined in terms of the rules and their detailed explication? Does there exist in me this quality or not?' If both Pātimokkhas [81] have not been well transmitted to him in detail . . . in terms of the rules and their detailed explication, and if, when asked: 'Where
did the Blessed One state this?' he is unable to reply, there will be those who say to him: 'Please first learn the discipline.' There will be those who say this to him.

"It is with respect to these five things that he should examine himself.

"And what are the five things that he should establish in himself? [He should consider:] '(6) I will speak at a proper time, not at an improper time; (7) I will speak truthfully, not falsely; (8) I will speak gently, not harshly; (9) I will speak in a beneficial way, not in a harmful way; (10) I will speak with a mind of loving-kindness, not while harboring hatred.' These are the five things that he should establish in himself.

"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who wishes to reprove another person should examine himself with respect to these five things and establish these five things in himself before he reproves the other person."

# 45 (5) Entering

"Bhikkhus, there are these ten dangers in entering the king's inner palace. What ten?

(1) "Here, the king is sitting with his queen. The bhikkhu enters, and either the queen smiles when she sees the bhikkhu or the bhikkhu smiles when he sees the queen. The king thinks: 'Surely, something has gone on between them, or something is about to go on.' This is the first danger in entering the king's inner palace.

(2) "Again, when the king has been busy, engaged with much work, he has had intercourse with one of the women but does not remember this, and because of their relations she has become pregnant. The king thinks: 'No one [82] else has entered here except the monk. Could this be the monk's work?' This is the second danger in entering the king's inner palace.

(3) "Again, a gem has been lost in the king's inner palace. The king thinks: 'No one else has entered here except the monk. Could this be the monk's work?' This is the third danger in entering the king's inner palace.

(4) "Again, the secret deliberations of the king's inner palace have spread to others. [^2045] The king thinks: 'No one else has entered here except the monk. Could this be the monk's work?' This is the fourth danger in entering the king's inner palace.
(5) "Again, in the king's inner palace a father longs for his son, or a son longs for his father. [^2046] They think: 'No one else has entered here except the monk. Could this be the monk's work?' This is the fifth danger in entering the king's inner palace.

(6) "Again, the king promotes someone. Those who are upset by this think: 'The king has close ties with the monk. Could this be the monk's work?' This is the sixth danger in entering the king's inner palace.

(7) "Again, the king demotes someone. Those who are upset by this think: 'The king has close ties with the monk. Could this be the monk's work?' This is the seventh danger in entering the king's inner palace.

(8) "Again, the king dispatches his army at an improper time. Those who are upset by this think: 'The king has close ties with the monk. Could this be the monk's work?' This is the eighth danger in entering the king's inner palace.

(9) "Again, after dispatching his army at a proper time, the king orders it to turn back while en route. Those who are upset by this think: [83] 'The king has close ties with the monk. Could this be the monk's work?' This is the ninth danger in entering the king's inner palace.

(10) "Again, in the king's inner palace there is the trampling of elephants, [^2047] horses, and chariots, as well as tantalizing forms, sounds, odors, tastes, and tactile objects that are not suitable for a monk. This is the tenth danger in entering the king's inner palace.

"These, bhikkhus, are the ten dangers in entering the king's inner palace."

# 46 (6) Sakyans

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Park. Then, on the uposatha day, a number of Sakyan lay followers approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to them:

"Sakyans, do you observe the uposatha complete in eight factors?"2048

"Sometimes we do, Bhante, and sometimes we don't."

"It is your misfortune and loss, Sakyans! When life is endangered by sorrow and death, you observe the uposatha
complete in eight factors [only] sometimes, and sometimes you don't. What do you think, Sakyans? Suppose there was a man here who, without doing anything unwholesome, would earn half a kahäpana daily for his work. [84] Would that suffice for calling him a clever and enterprising man?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"What do you think, Sakyans? Suppose there was a man here who, without doing anything unwholesome, would earn a kahäpana daily for his work. Would that suffice for calling him a clever and enterprising man?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"What do you think, Sakyans? Suppose there was a man here who, without doing anything unwholesome, would earn two kahāpanas ... three ... four ... five ... six ... seven ... eight ... nine . . . ten . . . twenty . . thirty . . forty . . fifty kahāpanas [^2049] daily for his work. Would that suffice for calling him a clever and enterprising man?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"What do you think, Sakyans? If he earns a hundred or a thousand kahāpanas day after day, deposits whatever he gains, and has a life span of a hundred years, living a hundred years, would he acquire a great mass of wealth?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"What do you think, Sakyans? On account of his wealth, because of his wealth, by reason of his wealth, could that man experience exclusively happiness for one night or one day, or for half a night or half a day?"

"No, Bhante. Why not? Because sensual pleasures are impermanent, empty, false, and deceptive."

"However, Sakyans, my disciple who dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute for ten years, practicing as I instruct him, might experience exclusively happiness for a hundred years, ten thousand years, [^2050] [85] a hundred thousand years, and ten million years. [^2051] And he might be a once-returner, a nonreturner, or surely a stream-enterer.

"Let alone ten years, Sakyans. My disciple who dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute for nine years . . . eight years . . . seven years...six years...five years...four years...three years...two years...one year, practicing as I instruct him, might experience
exclusively happiness for a hundred years, ten thousand years, a hundred thousand years, and ten million years. And he might be a once-returner, a non-returner, or surely a stream-enterer.

"Let alone one year, Sakyans. My disciple who dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute for ten months, practicing as I instruct him, might experience exclusively happiness for a hundred years, ten thousand years, a hundred thousand years, and ten million years. And he might be a once-returner, a non-returner, or surely a stream-enterer.

"Let alone ten months, Sakyans. My disciple who dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute for nine months ... eight months ...seven months ... six months ... five months ... four months ... three months ...two months ... one month ... half a month, practicing as I instruct him, might experience exclusively happiness for a hundred years, ten thousand years, a hundred thousand years, and ten million years. And he might be a once-returner, a non-returner, or surely a stream-enterer.

"Let alone half a month, Sakyans. My disciple who dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute for ten nights and days, practicing as I instruct him, might experience exclusively happiness for a hundred years, ten thousand years, a hundred thousand years, and ten million years. And he might be a once-returner, a non-returner, or surely a stream-enterer.

"Let alone ten nights and days, Sakyans. My disciple who dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute for nine nights and days . . . eight nights and days . . . seven nights and days . . . [86] six nights and days ...five nights and days ... four nights and days ... three nights and days ... two nights and days ... one night and day, practicing as I instruct him, might experience exclusively happiness for a hundred years, ten thousand years, a hundred thousand years, and ten million years. And he might be a oncereturner, a non-returner, or surely a stream-enterer.

"It is your misfortune and loss, Sakyans! When life is endangered by sorrow and death, you observe the uposatha complete in eight factors [only] sometimes, and sometimes you don't."

"From today on, Bhante, we will observe the uposatha complete in eight factors."

# 47 (7) Mahāli

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then Mahāli the Licchavi approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, what is the cause and condition for the doing of bad kamma, for the occurrence of bad kamma?"2052

"Mahāli, (1) greed is a cause and condition for the doing of bad kamma, for the occurrence of bad kamma. (2) Hatred is a cause and condition...(3) Delusion is a cause and condition ...(4) Careless attention is a cause [87] and condition ... (5) A wrongly directed mind is a cause and condition for the doing of bad kamma, for the occurrence of bad kamma. This is the cause and condition for the doing of bad kamma, for the occurrence of bad kamma."

"Bhante, what is the cause and condition for the doing of good kamma, for the occurrence of good kamma?"

"Mahāli, (6) non-greed is a cause and condition for the doing of good kamma, for the occurrence of good kamma. (7) Nonhatred is a cause and condition...(8) Non-delusion is a cause and condition ...(9) Careful attention is a cause and condition ...(10) A rightly directed mind is a cause and condition for the doing of good kamma, for the occurrence of good kamma. This is the cause and condition for the doing of good kamma, for the occurrence of good kamma.

"If, Mahāli, these ten qualities did not exist in the world, unrighteous conduct, conduct contrary to the Dhamma, and righteous conduct, conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, would not be seen. But because these ten qualities exist in the world, unrighteous conduct, conduct contrary to the Dhamma, and righteous conduct, conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, are seen."

## 48 (8) Things

"Bhikkhus, there are these ten things that one who has gone forth should often reflect upon. What ten?

(1) "One who has gone forth should often reflect: 'I have entered upon a classless condition. [^2053]

(2) "One who has gone forth should often reflect: 'My living is dependent upon others. [^2054] [88]
(3) "One who has gone forth should often reflect: 'My deportment should be different. [^2055]

(4) "One who has gone forth should often reflect: 'Do I reproach myself in regard to virtuous behavior? [^2056]

(5) "One who has gone forth should often reflect: 'Do my wise fellow monks, having investigated, reproach me in regard to virtuous behavior?'

(6) "One who has gone forth should often reflect: 'I must be parted and separated from everyone and everything dear and agreeable to me. [^2057]

(7) "One who has gone forth should often reflect: 'I am the owner of my kamma, the heir of my kamma; I have kamma as my origin, kamma as my relative, kamma as my resort; I will be the heir of whatever kamma, good or bad, that I do.'

(8) "One who has gone forth should often reflect: 'How am I spending my nights and days?'

(9) "One who has gone forth should often reflect: 'Do I take delight in empty huts?'

(10) "One who has gone forth should often reflect: 'Have I attained any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, so that in my last days, when I am questioned by my fellow monks, I will not be embarrassed?'

"These, bhikkhus, are the ten things that one who has gone forth should often reflect upon."

49 (9) Subsisting through the Body

"Bhikkhus, these ten things subsist through the body. What ten? Cold, heat, hunger, thirst, defecation, urination, bodily restraint, verbal restraint, restraint in one's livelihood, and the formative activity of existence that leads to renewed existence. [^2058] These ten things subsist through the body."

# 50 (10) Arguments

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park: Now on that occasion, [89] after their meal, on returning from their alms round, a number of bhikkhus assembled in the assembly hall and were sitting together when they took to arguing and quarreling and fell into a dispute, stabbing each other with piercing words.

Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion
and went to the assembly hall, where he sat down on the prepared seat. The Blessed One then addressed the bhikkhus:

"Bhikkhus, what discussion were you engaged in just now as you were sitting together here? What was the conversation that was underway?"

"Here, Bhante, after our meal, on returning from our alms round, we assembled in the assembly hall and were sitting together when we took to arguing and quarreling and fell into a dispute, stabbing each other with piercing words."

"Bhikkhus, it is not suitable for you clansmen who have gone forth out of faith from the household life into homelessness to take to arguing and quarreling and to fall into a dispute, stabbing each other with piercing words.

"There are, bhikkhus, these ten principles of cordiality that create affection and respect and conduce to cohesiveness, to non-dispute, to concord, and to unity. [^3399] What ten?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. Since a bhikkhu is virtuous . . . this is a principle of cordiality that creates affection and respect and conduces to cohesiveness, to non-dispute, to concord, and to unity.

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and accumulates what he has learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life-such teachings as these he has learned much of, retained in mind, recited verbally, [90] investigated mentally, and penetrated well by view. Since a bhikkhu has learned much . . . this is a principle of cordiality that creates affection and respect and conduces . . . to unity.

(3) "Again, a bhikkhu has good friends, good companions, good comrades. Since a bhikkhu has good friends . . . this is a principle of cordiality that creates affection and respect and conduces . . . to unity.

(4) "Again, a bhikkhu is easy to correct and possesses qualities that make him easy to correct; he is patient and receives instruction respectfully. Since a bhikkhu is easy to correct . . .
this is a principle of cordiality that creates affection and respect and conduces . . . to unity.

(5) "Again, a bhikkhu is skillful and diligent in attending to the diverse chores that are to be done for his fellow monks; he possesses appropriate investigation there, and he is able to carry out and arrange everything properly. Since a bhikkhu is skillful and diligent...this is a principle of cordiality that creates affection and respect and conduces ... to unity.

(6) "Again, a bhikkhu loves the Dhamma and is pleasing in his assertions, filled with a lofty joy pertaining to the Dhamma and discipline. Since a bhikkhu loves the Dhamma . . . this is a principle of cordiality that creates affection and respect and conduces . . . to unity.

(7) "Again, a bhikkhu has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities. Since a bhikkhu has aroused energy ... [91]...this is a principle of cordiality that creates affection and respect and conduces ... to unity.

(8) "Again, a bhikkhu is content with any kind of robe, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick. Since a bhikkhu is content with any kind of robe ... this is a principle of cordiality that creates affection and respect and conduces ... to unity.

(9) "Again, a bhikkhu is mindful, possessing supreme mindfulness and alertness, one who remembers and recollects what was done and said long ago. Since a bhikkhu is mindful ... this is a principle of cordiality that creates affection and respect and conduces . . . to unity.

(10) "Again, a bhikkhu is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. Since a bhikkhu is wise . . . this is a principle of cordiality that creates affection and respect and conduces ... to unity.

"These, bhikkhus, are the ten principles of cordiality that create affection and respect and conduce to cohesiveness, to non-dispute, to concord, and to unity." [92]

# The Second Fifty

## I. One's Own Mind

## 51 (1) One's Own Mind

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who is not skilled in the ways of others' minds [should train]: 'I will be skilled in the ways of my own mind.' It is in this way that you should train yourselves.

"And how is a bhikkhu skilled in the ways of his own mind? It is just as if a woman or a man-young, youthful, and fond of ornaments-would look at her or his own facial reflection in a clean bright mirror or in a bowl of clear water. If they see any dust or blemish there, they will make an effort to remove it. But if they do not see any dust or blemish there, they will be glad about it; and their wish fulfilled, they will think, 'How fortunate that I'm clean! [^2060] So too, self-examination is very helpful for a bhikkhu [to grow] in wholesome qualities.

"[One should ask oneself:] (1) 'Am I often given to longing [93] or without longing? (2) Am I often given to ill will or without ill will? (3) Am I often overcome by dullness and drowsiness or free from dullness and drowsiness? (4) Am I often restless or calm? (5) Am I often plagued by doubt or free from doubt? (6) Am I often angry or without anger? (7) Is my mind often defiled or undefiled? (8) Is my body often agitated or unagitated? (9) Am I often lazy or energetic? (10) Am I often unconcentrated or concentrated? [^2061]

"If, by such self-examination, a bhikkhu knows: 'I am often given to longing, given to ill will, overcome by dullness and drowsiness, restless, plagued by doubt, angry, defiled in mind, agitated in body, lazy, and unconcentrated,' he should put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to abandon those same bad unwholesome qualities. Just as one whose clothes or head had caught fire would put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear com-
prehension to extinguish [the fire on] his clothes or head, so too that bhikkhu should put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to abandon those same bad unwholesome qualities. [94]

"But if, by such self-examination, a bhikkhu knows: 'I am often without longing, without ill will, free from dullness and drowsiness, calm, free from doubt, without anger, undefiled in mind, unagitated in body, energetic, and concentrated,' he should base himself on those same wholesome qualities and make a further effort to reach the destruction of the taints."

# 52 (2) Säriputta

There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend!" those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:

[Identical with 10:51, but spoken by Sāriputta.] [95-96]

## 53 (3) Standstill

"Bhikkhus, I do not praise even a standstill in wholesome qualities, much less decline. I praise only growth in wholesome qualities, not a standstill or deterioration. [^2062].

"And how is there deterioration-not a standstill or growthin wholesome qualities? Here, a bhikkhu has a certain degree of faith, virtuous behavior, learning, renunciation, wisdom, and discernment. Those qualities of his do not remain the same or increase. This, I say, is deterioration rather than a standstill or growth in wholesome qualities. Thus there is deteriorationnot a standstill or growth-in wholesome qualities.

"And how is there a standstill-not deterioration or growthin wholesome qualities? Here, a bhikkhu has a certain degree of faith, virtuous behavior, learning, renunciation, wisdom, and discernment. Those qualities of his do not deteriorate or increase. This, I say, is a standstill rather than deterioration or growth in wholesome qualities. Thus there is a standstill-not deterioration or growth-in wholesome qualities.

"And how is there growth-not a standstill or deteriorationin wholesome qualities? Here, a bhikkhu has a certain degree of faith, virtuous behavior, learning, renunciation, wisdom, and
discernment. Those qualities of his do not remain the same or deteriorate. This, I say, is growth rather than a standstill or deterioration in wholesome qualities. Thus there is growth-not a standstill or deterioration-in wholesome qualities.

"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who is not skilled in the ways of others' minds [should train]: 'I will be skilled in the ways of my own mind.' ... [97-98] ... [as in 10:51 down to:] ... But if, by such self-examination, a bhikkhu knows: 'I am often without longing ... and concentrated,' then he should base himself on those same wholesome qualities and make a further effort to reach the destruction of the taints."

# 54 (4) Serenity

"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who is not skilled in the ways of others' minds [should train]: 'I will be skilled in the ways of my own mind.' It is in this way that you should train yourselves.

"And how is a bhikkhu skilled in the ways of his own mind? It is just as if a woman or a man-young, youthful, and fond of ornaments-would look at her or his own facial reflection in a clean bright mirror or in a bowl of clear water. If they see any dust or blemish there, they will make an effort to remove it. But if they do not see any dust or blemish there, they will be glad about it, [99] and their wish fulfilled, they will think, 'How fortunate for me that I'm clean!'

"So too, bhikkhus, self-examination is very helpful for a bhikkhu [to grow] in wholesome qualities: [^2063] 'Do I gain internal serenity of mind or not? Do I gain the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena or not?'

(1) "If, by such self-examination, a bhikkhu knows: 'I gain internal serenity of mind but not the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena,' he should base himself on internal serenity of mind and make an effort to gain the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena. Then, some time later, he gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena.

(2) "But if, by such self-examination, he knows: 'I gain the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena but not internal serenity of mind,' he should base himself on the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena and make an effort to gain internal serenity of mind. Then, some time later, he gains both the
higher wisdom of insight into phenomena and internal serenity of mind.

(3) "But if, by such self-examination, he knows: 'I gain neither internal serenity of mind nor the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena,' he should put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to obtain both those wholesome qualities. Just as one whose clothes or head had caught fire would put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to extinguish [the fire on] his clothes or head, so that bhikkhu should put forth extraordinary desire, [100] effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to obtain both those wholesome qualities. Then, some time later, he gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena.

(4) "But if, by such self-examination, he knows: 'I gain both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena,' he should base himself on those same wholesome qualities and make a further effort to reach the destruction of the taints.

"Robes, I say, are twofold: to be used and those not to be used. [^2064] Almsfood too, I say, is twofold: that to be used and that not to be used. Lodgings too, I say, are twofold: those to be used and those not to be used. Villages or towns too, I say, are twofold: those to be resorted to and those not to be resorted to. Countries or regions too, I say, are twofold: those to be resorted to and those not to be resorted to. Persons too, I say, are twofold: those to be associated with and those not to be associated with.

(5) "When it was said: 'Robes, I say, are twofold: those to be used and those not to be used,' for what reason was this said? If one knows of a robe: 'When I use this robe, unwholesome qualities increase in me and wholesome qualities decline,' one should not use such a robe. But if one knows of a robe: 'When I use this robe, unwholesome qualities decline in me and wholesome qualities increase,' one should use such a robe. When it was said: 'Robes, I say, are twofold: to be used and not to be used,' it is because of this that this was said.

(6) "When it was said: 'Almsfood too, I say, is twofold: that to
be used and that not to be used,' for what reason was this said? If one knows of some almsfood: 'When I use this almsfood, unwholesome qualities increase in me and wholesome [101] qualities decline,' one should not use such almsfood. But if one knows of some almsfood: 'When I use this almsfood, unwholesome qualities decline in me and wholesome qualities increase,' one should use such almsfood. When it was said: 'Almsfood too, I say, is twofold: that to be used and that not to be used,' it is because of this that this was said.

(7) "When it was said: 'Lodgings too, I say, are twofold: those to be used and those not to be used,' for what reason was this said? If one knows of a lodging: 'When I use this lodging, unwholesome qualities increase in me and wholesome qualities decline,' one should not use such a lodging. But if one knows of a lodging: 'When I use this lodging, unwholesome qualities decline in me and wholesome qualities increase,' one should use such a lodging. When it was said: 'Lodgings too, I say, are twofold: those to be used and those not to be used,' it is because of this that this was said.

(8) "When it was said: 'Villages or towns too, I say, are twofold: those to be resorted to and those not to be resorted to,' for what reason was this said? If one knows of a village or town: 'When I resort to this village or town, unwholesome qualities increase in me and wholesome qualities decline,' one should not resort to such a village or town. But if one knows of a village or town: 'When I resort to this village or town, unwholesome qualities decline in me and wholesome qualities increase,' one should resort to such a village or town. When it was said: 'Villages or towns too, I say, are twofold: those to be resorted to and those not to be resorted to,' it is because of this that this was said.

(9) "When it was said: 'Countries or regions too, I say, are twofold: those to be resorted to and those not to be resorted to,' for what reason was this said? If one knows of a country or region: 'When I resort to this country or region, unwholesome qualities increase in me [102] and wholesome qualities decline,' one should not resort to such a country or region. But if one knows of a country or region: 'When I resort to this country or region, unwholesome qualities decline in me and wholesome qualities increase,' one should resort to such a country or
region. When it was said: 'Countries or regions too, I say, are twofold: those to be resorted to and those not to be resorted to,' it is because of this that this was said."

(10) "When it was said: 'Persons too, I say, are twofold: those to be associated with and those not to be associated with,' for what reason was this said? If one knows of a person: 'When I associate with this person, unwholesome qualities increase in me and wholesome qualities decline,' one should not associate with such a person. But if one knows of a person: 'When I associate with this person, unwholesome qualities decline in me and wholesome qualities increase,' one should associate with such a person. When it was said: 'Persons too, I say, are twofold: those to be associated with and those not to be associated with,' it is because of this that this was said."

# 55 (5) Decline

There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend!" those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:

"Friends, it is said: 'A person subject to decline, a person subject to decline.' In what way has the Blessed One said that a person is subject to decline, and in what way that a person is not subject to decline?"

"We would come from far away, friend, to learn the meaning of this statement from the Venerable Sāriputta. It would be good if he would clear up the meaning of this statement: [103] Having heard it from him, the bhikkhus will retain it in mind."

"Well then, friends, listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, friend," those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:

"In what way, friends, has the Blessed One said that a person is subject to decline? Here, a bhikkhu does not get to hear a teaching he has not heard before, forgets those teachings he has already heard, does not bring to mind those teachings with which he is already familiar, and does not understand what he has not understood. It is in this way that the Blessed One has said a person is subject to decline. [^2065]

"And in what way, friends, has the Blessed One said that a
person is not subject to decline? Here, a bhikkhu gets to hear a teaching he has not heard before, does not forget those teachings he has already heard, brings to mind those teachings with which he is already familiar, and understands what he has not understood. It is in this way that the Blessed One has said a person is not subject to decline.

"Friends, a bhikkhu who is not skilled in the ways of others' minds [should train]: 'I will be skilled in the ways of my own mind.' It is in this way that you should train yourselves.

"And how, friends, is a bhikkhu skilled in the ways of his own mind? It is just as if a woman or a man-young, youthful, and fond of ornaments-would look at her or his own facial reflection in a clean and bright mirror or in a bowl of clear water. If they see any dust or blemish there, they will make an effort to remove it. But if they do not see any dust or blemish there, they will be glad about it; [104] and their wish fulfilled, they will think, 'How fortunate for me that I'm clean!' So too, selfexamination is very helpful for a bhikkhu [to grow] in wholesome qualities.

"[One should ask oneself:] (1) 'Am I often without longing? Does this quality exist in me or not? (2) Am I often without ill will? Does this quality exist in me or not? (3) Am I often free from dullness and drowsiness? Does this quality exist in me or not? (4) Am I often calm? Does this quality exist in me or not? (5) Am I often free from doubt? Does this quality exist in me or not? (6) Am I often without anger? Does this quality exist in me or not? (7) Is my mind often undefiled? Does this quality exist in me or not? (8) Do I gain internal joy of the Dhamma? Does this quality exist in me or not? (9) Do I gain internal serenity of mind? Does this quality exist in me or not? (10) Do I gain the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena? Does this quality exist in me or not?'

"If, by such self-examination, a bhikkhu does not see any of these wholesome qualities present in himself, then he should put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to obtain those wholesome qualities. Just as one whose clothes or head had caught fire would put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to extinguish [the fire on] his clothes or head, so that bhikkhu should put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal,
enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to obtain those wholesome qualities.

"But if, by such self-examination, a bhikkhu sees some wholesome qualities present in himself but not others, [105] he should base himself on those wholesome qualities that he sees in himself and put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal; enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to obtain those wholesome qualities that he does not see in himself. Just as one whose clothes or head had caught fire would put forth extraordinary desire ...to extinguish [the fire on] his clothes or head, so that bhikkhu should base himself on the wholesome qualities that he sees in himself and put forth extraordinary desire ...to obtain those wholesome qualities that he does not see in himself.

"But if, by such self-examination, a bhikkhu sees all these wholesome qualities present in himself, he should base himself on those same wholesome qualities and make a further effort to reach the destruction of the taints."

# 56 (6) Perceptions (1)

"Bhikkhus, these ten perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are of great fruit and benefit, culminating in the deathless, having the deathless as their consummation. [^2066] What ten? (1) The perception of unattractiveness, (2) the perception of death, (3) the perception of the repulsiveness of food, (4) the perception of non-delight in the entire world, (5) the perception of impermanence, (6) the perception of suffering in the impermanent, (7) the perception of non-self in what is suffering, (8) the perception of abandoning, (9) the perception of dispassion, and (10) the perception of cessation. These ten perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are of great fruit and benefit, culminating in the deathless, having the deathless as their consummation." [106]

## 57 (7) Perceptions (2)

"Bhikkhus, these ten perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are of great fruit and benefit, culminating in the deathless, having the deathless as their consummation. What ten? (1) The perception of impermanence, (2) the perception of non-self, (3) the perception of death, (4) the perception of the repulsiveness of food, (5) the perception of non-delight in the
entire world, (6) the perception of a skeleton, (7) the perception of a worm-infested corpse, (8) the perception of a livid corpse, (9) the perception of a fissured corpse, and (10) the perception of a bloated corpse. [^2067] These ten perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are of great fruit and benefit, culminating in the deathless, having the deathless as their consummation."

# 58 (8) Roots

"Bhikkhus, wanderers of other sects may ask you: (1) 'In what, friends, are all things rooted? (2) Through what do they come into being? (3) From what do they originate? (4) Upon what do they converge? (5) By what are they headed? (6) What exercises authority over them? (7) What is their supervisor? (8) What is their core? (9) In what do they culminate? (10) What is their consummation?' If you are asked thus, how would you answer them? [^2068]

"Bhante, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the Blessed One, take recourse in the Blessed One. It would be good if the Blessed One would clear up the meaning of this statement. Having heard it from him, the bhikkhus will retain it in mind."

"Then listen, bhikkhus, and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, if wanderers of other sects should ask you: 'What, friends, are all things rooted in? ... [107] ... What is their consummation?' you should answer them as follows.

"Friends, (1) all things are rooted in desire. (2) They come into being through attention. (3) They originate from contact. (4) They converge upon feeling. (5) They are headed by concentration. (6) Mindfulness exercises authority over them. (7) Wisdom is their supervisor. (8) Liberation is their core. (9) They culminate in the deathless. (10) Their consummation is nibbāna. [^2069]

"If you are asked thus, bhikkhus, it is in such a way that you should answer those wanderers of other sects."

## 59 (9) Going Forth

"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'Our minds will be strengthened in accordance with [the spirit of]
our going forth, and arisen bad unwholesome qualities will not obsess our minds. [^2070] (1) Our minds will be strengthened in the perception of impermanence. (2) Our minds will be strengthened in the perception of non-self. (3) Our minds will be strengthened in the perception of unattractiveness. (4) Our minds will be strengthened in the perception of danger. (5) We will know the even and uneven ways of the world, [^2071] and our minds will be strengthened in this perception. (6) We will know the coming into being and extermination of the world, [^2072] and our minds will be strengthened in this perception. (7) We will know the origination and passing away of the world, and our minds will be strengthened in this perception. (8) Our minds will be strengthened in the perception of abandoning. (9) Our minds will be strengthened in the perception of dispassion. (10) Our minds will be strengthened in the perception of cessation. [^2073] [108] It is in such a way that you should you train yourselves.

"When a bhikkhu's mind has been strengthened in accordance with [the spirit of] his going forth, and arisen bad unwholesome qualities do not obsess his mind-when his mind has been strengthened in the perception of impermanence . . . when his mind has been' strengthened in the perception of cessation-one of two fruits is to be expected for him: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue remaining, the state of non-returning."

# 60 (10) Girimananda

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Now on that occasion the Venerable Girimānanda was sick, afflicted, and gravely ill. [^2074] Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, the Venerable Girimānanda is sick, afflicted, and gravely ill. It would be good if the Blessed One would visit him out of compassion."

"If, Ānanda, you visit the bhikkhu Girimānanda and speak to him about ten perceptions, it is possible that on hearing about them his affliction will immediately subside. What are the ten? [109]

"(1) The perception of impermanence, (2) the perception of
non-self, (3) the perception of unattractiveness, (4) the perception of danger, (5) the perception of abandoning, (6) the perception of dispassion, (7) the perception of cessation, (8) the perception of non-delight in the entire world, (9) the perception of impermanence in all conditioned phenomena, and (10) mindfulness of breathing.

(1) "And what, Ānanda, is the perception of impermanence? Here, having gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'Form is impermanent, feeling is impermanent, perception is impermanent, volitional activities are impermanent, consciousness is impermanent.' Thus he dwells contemplating impermanence in these five aggregates subject to clinging. This is called the perception of impermanence.

(2) "And what, Ānanda, is the perception of non-self? Here, having gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'The eye is non-self, forms are nonself; the ear is non-self, sounds are non-self; the nose is non-self, odors are non-self; the tongue is non-self, tastes are non-self; the body is non-self, tactile objects are non-self; the mind is non-self, mental phenomena are non-self.' Thus he dwells contemplating non-self in these six internal and external sense bases. This is called the perception of non-self.

(3) "And what, Ānanda, is the perception of unattractiveness? Here, a bhikkhu reviews this very body upward from the soles of the feet and downward from the tips of the hairs, enclosed in skin, as full of many kinds of impurities: 'There are in this body hair of the head, hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach, excrement, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, fluid of the joints, urine.' Thus he dwells contemplating unattractiveness in this body. This is called the perception of unattractiveness.

(4) "And what, Ānanda, is the perception of danger? Here, having gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'This body is the source of much pain [110] and danger; for all sorts of afflictions arise in this body, that is, eye-disease, disease of the inner ear, nose-disease, tonguedisease, body-disease, head-disease, disease of the external ear, mouth-disease, tooth-disease, [^2075] cough, asthma, catarrh,
pyrexia, fever, stomach ache, fainting, dysentery, gripes, cholera, leprosy, boils, eczema, tuberculosis, epilepsy, ringworm, itch, scab, chickenpox, scabies, hemorrhage, diabetes, hemorrhoids, cancer, fistula; illnesses originating from bile, phlegm, wind, or their combination; illnesses produced by change of climate; illnesses produced by careless behavior; illnesses produced by assault; or illnesses produced as the result of kamma; and cold, heat, hunger, thirst, defecation, and urination.' Thus he dwells contemplating danger in this body. This is called the perception of danger.

(5) "And what, Ānanda, is the perception of abandoning? Here, a bhikkhu does not tolerate an arisen sensual thought; he abandons it, dispels it, terminates it, and obliterates it. He does not tolerate an arisen thought of ill will ... an arisen thought of harming . . .bad unwholesome states whenever they arise; he abandons them, dispels them, terminates them, and obliterates them. This is called the perception of abandoning.

(6) "And what, Ānanda, is the perception of dispassion? Here, having gone to the forest, to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, the stilling of all activities, the relinquishment of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, dispassion, nibbāna.' This is called the perception of dispassion. [^2076]

(7) "And what, Ānanda, is the perception of cessation? Here, having gone to the forest, to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'This is peaceful, [111] this is sublime, that is, the stilling of all activities, the relinquishment of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, cessation, nibbāna.' This is called the perception of cessation.

(8) "And what, Ānanda, is the perception of non-delight in the entire world? Here, a bhikkhu refrains from [^2077] any engagement and clinging, mental standpoints, adherences, and underlying tendencies in regard to the world, abandoning them without clinging to them. This is called the perception of non-delight in the entire world.

(9) "And what, Ānanda, is the perception of impermanence in all conditioned phenomena? Here, a bhikkhu is repelled, humiliated, and disgusted by all conditioned phenomena. This is called the perception of impermanence in all conditioned phenomena. [^2078]
(10) "And what, Ānanda, is mindfulness of breathing? Here, a bhikkhu, having gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, sits down. Having folded his legs crosswise, straightened his body, and established mindfulness in front of him, just mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out.

"Breathing in long, he knows: 'I breathe in long'; or breathing out long, he knows: 'I breathe out long.' Breathing in short, he knows: 'I breathe in short'; or breathing out short, he knows: 'I breathe out short.' He trains thus: 'Experiencing the whole body, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Experiencing the whole body, I will breathe out.' He trains thus: 'Tranquilizing the bodily activity, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Tranquilizing the bodily activity, I will breathe out.'

"He trains thus: 'Experiencing rapture, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Experiencing rapture, I will breathe out.' He trains thus: 'Experiencing happiness, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Experiencing happiness, I will breathe out.' He trains thus: 'Experiencing the mental activity, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Experiencing the mental activity, I will breathe out.' He trains thus: 'Tranquilizing the mental activity, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Tranquilizing the mental activity, I will breathe out. [^2079]

"He trains thus: 'Experiencing the mind, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Experiencing the mind, I will breathe out.' [112] He trains thus: 'Gladdening the mind, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Gladdening the mind, I will breathe out.' He trains thus: 'Concentrating the mind, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Concentrating the mind, I will breathe out.' He trains thus: 'Liberating the mind, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Liberating the mind, I will breathe out. [^2080]

"He trains thus: 'Contemplating impermanence, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Contemplating impermanence, I will breathe out.' He trains thus: 'Contemplating fading away, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Contemplating fading away, I will breathe out.' He trains thus: 'Contemplating cessation, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Contemplating cessation, I will breathe out.' He trains thus: 'Contemplating relinquishment, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Contemplating relinquishment, I will breathe out.'

"This is called mindfulness of breathing.
"If, Ānanda, you visit the bhikkhu Girimānanda and speak to him about these ten perceptions, it is possible that on hearing about them he will immediately recover from his affliction."

Then, when the Venerable Ānanda had learned these ten perceptions from the Blessed One, he went to the Venerable Girimānanda and spoke to him about them. When the Venerable Girimānanda heard about these ten perceptions, his affliction immediately subsided. The Venerable Girimānanda recovered from that affliction, and that is how he was cured of his affliction. [113]

# II. PAIRS

61 (1) Ignorance

"Bhikkhus, this is said: 'A first point of ignorance, bhikkhus, is not seen such that before this there was no ignorance and afterward it came into being. [^2981] Still, ignorance is seen to have a specific condition.

"I say, bhikkhus, that ignorance has a nutriment; [^2082] it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for ignorance? It should be said: the five hindrances. The five hindrances, too, I say, have a nutriment; they are not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for the five hindrances? It should be said: the three kinds of misconduct. The three kinds of misconduct, too, I say, have a nutriment; they are not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for the three kinds of misconduct? It should be said: non-restraint of the sense faculties. Nonrestraint of the sense faculties, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for nonrestraint of the sense faculties? It should be said: lack of mindfulness and clear comprehension. Lack of mindfulness and clear comprehension, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for lack of mindfulness and clear comprehension? It should be said: careless attention. Careless attention, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for careless attention? It should be said: lack of faith. Lack of faith, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for lack of faith? It should be said: not hearing the good Dhamma. Not hearing the good Dhamma, too, I say, has a nutriment; it
is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for not hearing the good Dhamma? It should be said: not associating with good persons. [^3893]

"Thus not associating with good persons, becoming full, fills up not hearing the good Dhamma. Not hearing the good Dhamma, becoming full, fills up lack of faith. Lack of faith, becoming full, fills up careless attention. Careless attention, becoming full, fills up lack of mindfulness and clear comprehension. Lack of mindfulness and clear comprehension, becoming full, [114] fills up non-restraint of the sense faculties. Non-restraint of the sense faculties, becoming full, fills up the three kinds of misconduct. The three kinds of misconduct, becoming full, fill up the five hindrances. The five hindrances, becoming full, fill up ignorance. Thus there is nutriment for ignorance, and in this way it becomes full.

"Just as, when it is raining and the rain pours down in thick droplets on a mountaintop, the water flows down along the slope and fills the clefts, gullies, and creeks; these, becoming full, fill up the pools; these, becoming full, fill up the lakes; these, becoming full, fill up the streams; these, becoming full, fill up the rivers; and these, becoming full, fill up the great ocean; thus there is nutriment for the great ocean, and in this way it becomes full. So too, not associating with good persons, becoming full, fills up not hearing the good Dhamma.... The five hindrances, becoming full, fill up ignorance. Thus there is nutriment for ignorance, and in this way it becomes full.

"I say, bhikkhus, that (1) true knowledge and liberation have a nutriment; they are not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for true knowledge and liberation? It should be said: (2) the seven factors of enlightenment. The seven factors of enlightenment, too, I say, have a nutriment; they are not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for the seven factors of enlightenment? It should'be said: (3) the four establishments of mindfulness. The four establishments of mindfulness, too, I say, have a nutriment; they are not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for the four establishments of mindfulness? It should be said: (4) the three kinds of good conduct. [115] The three kinds of good conduct, too, I say, have a nutriment; they are not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for the three kinds of good conduct? It should be said: (5) restraint
of the sense faculties. Restraint of the sense faculties, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for restraint of the sense faculties? It should be said: (6) mindfulness and clear comprehension. Mindfulness and clear comprehension, too, I say, have a nutriment; they are not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for mindfulness and clear comprehension? It should be said: (7) careful attention. Careful attention, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for careful attention? It should be said: (8) faith. Faith, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And, what is the nutriment for faith? It should be said: (9) hearing the good Dhamma. Hearing the good Dhamma, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for hearing the good Dhamma? It should be said: (10) associating with good persons.

"Thus associating with good persons, becoming full; fills up hearing the good Dhamma. Hearing the good Dhamma, becoming full, fills up faith. Faith, becoming full, fills up careful attention. Careful attention, becoming full, fills up mindfulness and clear comprehension. Mindfulness and clear comprehension, becoming full, fill up restraint of the sense faculties. Restraint of the sense faculties, becoming full, fills up the three kinds of good conduct. The three kinds of good conduct, becoming full, fill up the four establishments of mindfulness. The four establishments of mindfulness, becoming full, fill up the seven factors of enlightenment. The seven factors of enlightenment, becoming full, fill up true knowledge and liberation. Thus there is nutriment for true knowledge and liberation, and in this way they become full.

"Just as, when it is raining and the rain pours down in thick droplets on a mountaintop, the water flows down along the slope and fills the clefts, gullies, and creeks; these, becoming full, fill up the pools; these, becoming full, fill up the lakes; these, becoming full, fill up the streams; these, becoming full, fill up the rivers; and these, becoming full, [116] fill up the great ocean; thus there is nutriment for the great ocean, and in this way it becomes full. So too, associating with good persons, becoming full, fills up hearing the good Dhamma... The seven factors of enlightenment, becoming full, fill up true knowledge
and liberation. Thus there is nutriment for true knowledge and liberation, and in this way they become full."

# 62 (2) Craving

"Bhikkhus, it is said: 'A first point of craving for existence, bhikkhus, is not seen such that before this there was no craving for existence and afterward it came into being.' Still, craving for existence is seen to have a specific condition.

"I say, bhikkhus, that craving for existence has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for craving for existence? It should be said: ignorance. Ignorance, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for ignorance? It should be said: the five hindrances ...[as in 10:61] [117]... And what is the nutriment for not hearing the good Dhamma? It should be said: not associating with good persons.

"Thus not associating with good persons, becoming full, fills up not hearing the good Dhamma.... The five hindrances, becoming full, fill up ignorance. Ignorance, becoming full, fills up craving for existence. Thus there is nutriment for craving for existence, and in this way it becomes full.

"Just as, when it is raining and the rain pours down in thick droplets on a mountaintop, the water flows down along the slope ...[118] ... and the rivers, becoming full, fill up the great ocean; thus there is nutriment for the great ocean, and in this way it becomes full. So too, not associating with good persons, becoming full, fills up not hearing the good Dhamma . . . and ignorance, becoming full, fills up craving for existence. Thus there is nutriment for craving for existence, and in this way it becomes full.

"I say, bhikkhus, that (1) true knowledge and liberation have a nutriment; they are not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for true knowledge and liberation? It should be said: (2) the seven factors of enlightenment. . . . Hearing the good Dhamma, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for hearing the good Dhamma? It should be said: (10) associating with good persons.

"Thus associating with good persons, becoming full, fills up hearing the good Dhamma....[119] The seven factors of enlightenment, becoming full, fill up true knowledge and liberation.

Thus there is nutriment for true knowledge and liberation, and in this way they become full.

"Just as, when it is raining and the rain pours down in thick droplets on a mountain top, the water flows down along the slope . . . and the rivers, becoming full, fill up the great ocean; thus there is nutriment for the great ocean, and in this way it becomes full. So too, associating with good persons, becoming full, fills up hearing the good Dhamma. . . . The seven factors of enlightenment, becoming full, fill up true knowledge and liberation. Thus there is nutriment for true knowledge and liberation, and in this way they become full."

# 63 (3) Certainty

"Bhikkhus, all those who have reached certainty about me are. accomplished in view. Of those accomplished in view, five gain the goal here in this world; [^2084] five gain the goal having left this world.

"Who are the five that gain the goal here in this world? [120] The seven-times-at-most attainer, the family-to-family attainer, the one-seed attainer, [^2085] the once-returner, and one who, in this very life, is an arahant. These five gain the goal in this world.

"Who are the five that gain the goal having left this world? The attainer of nibbāna in the interval, the attainer of nibbāna upon landing, the attainer of nibbāna without exertion, the attainer of nibbāna through exertion, and one bound upstream, heading toward the Akaniṭtha realm. [^2086] These five gain the goal having left this world.

"All those, bhikkhus, who have reached certainty about me are accomplished in view. Of those accomplished in view, the former five gain the goal here in this world; the latter five gain the goal having left this world."

## 64 (4) Unwavering

"Bhikkhus, all those who have unwavering confidence in me are stream-enterers. [^2087] Of those stream-enterers, five gain the goal here in this world; five gain the goal having left this world.

"Who are the five that gain the goal here in this world? The seven-times-at-most attainer, the family-to-family attainer, the one-seed attainer, the once-returner, and one who, in this very life, is an arahant. These five gain the goal here in this world.
"Who are the five that gain the goal having left this world?

"All those, bhikkhus, who have unwavering confidence in me are stream-enterers. Of those stream-enterers, the former five gain the goal here in this world; the latter five gain the goal having left this world."

65 (5) Happiness (1).

On one occasion the Venerable Sāriputta was dwelling among the Magadhans at Nālakagāmaka. Then the wanderer Sāmaṇ̣akāni [121] approached the Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Sāriputta:

"Friend Sāriputta, what is happiness? What is suffering?"

"Rebirth, friend, is suffering. No rebirth is happiness. When there is rebirth, this suffering is to be expected: cold, heat, hunger, thirst, defecation, and urination; being afflicted by fire, sticks, or knives; and relatives and friends get together and scold one. When there is rebirth, this suffering is to be expected.

"When there is no rebirth, this happiness is to be expected: no cold, no heat, no hunger, no thirst, no defecation, and no urination; no being afflicted by fire, sticks, or knives; and relatives and friends don't get together and scold one. When there is no rebirth, this happiness is to be expected."

66 (6) Happiness (2)

On one occasion the VenerableSāriputta was dwelling among the Magadhans at Nālakagāmaka. Then the wanderer Sāmaṇ̣̣akāni approached the Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side [122] and said to the Venerable Sāriputta:

"Friend Sāriputta, what is happiness in this Dhamma and discipline, and what is suffering?"

"Dissatisfaction, friend, is suffering in this Dhamma and dis-
cipline. Enjoyment is happiness. When there is dissatisfaction, this suffering is to be expected. (1) When walking, one does not find happiness or comfort. (2) When standing still ... (3) When sitting ... (4) When lying down ... (5) When in the village ... (6) When in the forest ... (7) When at the foot of a tree ... (8) When in an empty hut ... (9) When in the open air ... (10) When amid the bhikkhus, one does not find happiness or comfort. When there is dissatisfaction, this suffering is to be expected.

"When there is enjoyment, this happiness is to be expected. (1) When walking, one finds happiness and comfort. (2) When standing still ... (3) When sitting ... (4) When lying down ... (5) When in the village ... (6) When in the forest ... (7) When at the foot of a tree ... (8) When in an empty hut ... (9) When in the open air ... (10) When amid the bhikkhus, one finds happiness or comfort. When there is enjoyment, this happiness is to be expected."

# 67 (7) Nalakapāna (1)

On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Sangha of bhikkhus when he reached the Kosalan town named Nalakapāna. There at Nalakapāna the Blessed One dwelled in a Judas tree grove. Now on that occasion, on the day of the uposatha, the Blessed One was sitting surrounded by the Sangha of bhikkhus. Having instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened the Sangha of bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk for much of the night, and having surveyed the utterly silent Sangha of bhikkhus, the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Sāriputta: "The Sangha of bhikkhus is free from dullness and drowsiness, Sāriputta. Give a [123] Dhamma talk to the bhikkhus. My back is aching, so I will stretch it."

"Yes, Bhante," the Venerable Sāriputta replied.

Then the Blessed One folded his outer robe in four and lay down on his right side in the lion's posture, with one foot overlapping the other, mindful and clearly comprehending, after noting in his mind the idea of rising. The Venerable Sāriputta then addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend!" those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:

"Friends, for one who does not have faith in [cultivating]
wholesome qualities, who does not have a sense of moral shame ... who does not have moral dread ... who does not have energy ... who does not have wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, whether night or day comes, only deterioration and not growth in wholesome qualities is to be expected. Just as, during the dark fortnight, whether night or day comes, the moon only deteriorates in beauty, roundness, and brightness, in diameter and circumference, so too, for one who does not have faith... wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, whether night or day comes, only deterioration and not growth in wholesome qualities is to be expected.

(1) "'A person without faith,' friends: this is a case of decline. (2) 'A morally shameless person' ...(3) 'A morally reckless person' ...(4) 'A lazy person' ...(5) 'An unwise person' ...(6) 'An angry person' ...(7) 'A hostile person' ...(8) 'A person of evil desires' ...(9) 'A person with bad friends' ...(10) 'A person who holds wrong view': this is a case of decline.

"Friends, for one who has faith in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, for one who has a sense of moral shame ...for one who has moral dread ... for one who has energy ...[124] for one who has wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, whether night or day comes, only growth and not deterioration in wholesome qualities is to be expected. Just as, during the bright fortnight, whether night or day comes, the moon only increases in beauty, roundness, and brightness, in diameter and circumference, so too, for one who has faith ... wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, whether night or day comes, only growth and not deterioration in wholesome qualities is to be expected.

(1) "'A person with faith,' friends: this is a case of non-decline. (2) 'A person with a sense of moral shame' ...(3) 'A person with moral dread' ...(4) 'An energetic person' ...(5) 'A wise person' ...(6) 'A person without anger' ...(7) 'A person without hostility' ... (8) 'A person without evil desires' ... (9) 'A person with good friends' ... (10) 'A person who holds right view': this is a case of non-decline."

Then the Blessed One got up and addressed the Venerable Sāriputta: "Good, good, Sāriputta! Sāriputta, for one who does not have faith in [cultivating] wholesome qualities ... [the Buddha here repeats Sāriputta's entire discourse:] [125] ... (10) 'A person who holds right view': this is a case of non-decline."

68 (8) Nalakapāna (2)

[Opening as in 10:67, down to:] [126]

The Venerable Sāriputta then addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend!" those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:

"Friends, for one (1) who does not have faith in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, (2) who does not have a sense of moral shame ... (3) who does not have moral dread ... (4) who does not have energy ...(5) who does not have wisdom ...(6) who does not lend an ear ...(7) who does not retain the Dhamma in mind ... (8) who does not examine the meaning ... (9) who does not practice in accordance with the Dhamma ...(10) who is not heedful in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, whether night or day comes, only deterioration and not growth in wholesome qualities is to be expected. Just as, during the dark fortnight, whether night or day comes, the moon only deteriorates in beauty, roundness, and brightness, in diameter and circumference, so too, for one who does not have faith in [cultivating] wholesome qualities ... for one who is not heedful in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, whether night or day comes, only deterioration and not growth in wholesome qualities is to be expected.

"Friends, for one (1) who has faith in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, (2) who has a sense of moral shame . . (3) who has moral dread ... (4) who has energy ...(5) who has wisdom ... (6) who lends an ear ... (7) who retains the Dhamma in mind ...(8) who examines the meaning ...(9) who practices in accordance with the Dhamma ... (10) who is heedful [cultivating] wholesome qualities, whether night or day comes, only growth and not deterioration in wholesome qualities is to be expected. Just as, [127] during the bright fortnight, whether night or day comes, the moon only increases in beauty, roundness, and brightness, in diameter and circumference, so too, for one who has faith in [cultivating] wholesome qualities ... heedfulness in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, whether night or day comes, only growth and not deterioration in wholesome qualities is to be expected."

Then the Blessed One got up and addressed the Venerable Sāriputta: "Good, good, Sāriputta! Sāriputta, for one who does not have faith in [cultivating] wholesome qualities ... [the

Buddha here repeats Sāriputta's entire discourse down to:|[128] ... whether night or day comes, only growth and not deterioration in wholesome qualities is to be expected."

69 (9) Topics of Discussion (1)

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇ̣ika's Park. Now on that occasion, after their meal, on returning from their alms round, a number of bhikkhus had assembled in the assembly hall and were sitting together engaging in various kinds of pointless talk, that is: talk about kings, thieves, and ministers of state; talk about armies, perils, and wars; talk about food, drink, garments, and beds; talk about garlands and scents; talk about relatives, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and talk about heroes; street talk and talk by the well; talk about the departed; miscellaneous talk; speculation about the world and the sea; talk about becoming this or that.

Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and went to the assembly hall, where he sat down on the prepared seat. The Blessed One then addressed the bhikkhus:

"Bhikkhus, what discussion were you engaged in just now as you were sitting together here? What was the conversation that was underway?"

"Here, Bhante, after our meal, on returning from our alms round, we assembled in the assembly hall and were sitting together engaging in various kinds of pointless talk, that is: talk about kings, thieves, and ministers of state ... talk about becoming this or that."

"Bhikkhus, it is not suitable for you, [129] clansmen who have gone forth from the household life into homelessness out of faith, to engage in various kinds of pointless talk, that is: talk about kings, thieves, and ministers of state ... talk about becoming this or that.

"There are, bhikkhus, these ten topics of discussion. What ten? Talk on fewness of desires, on contentment, on solitude, on not being bound up with others, on arousing energy, on virtuous behavior, on concentration, on wisdom, on liberation, on knowledge and vision of liberation. These are the ten topics of discussion.

"If, bhikkhus, you engage in discussion on any of these ten
topics, your splendor might surpass even the splendor of the sun and moon, as powerful and mighty as they are, how much more then that of the wanderers of other sects!"

70 (10) Topics of Discussion (2)

[^2088]

"Bhikkhus, there are these ten grounds for praise. What ten? [130]

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is himself of few desires and speaks to the bhikkhus on fewness of desires. This is a ground for praise: 'The bhikkhu is himself of few desires and speaks to the bhikkhus on fewness of desires.'

(6) "He is himself accomplished in virtuous behavior and speaks to the bhikkhus on accomplishment in virtuous behavior. This is a ground for praise: 'The bhikkhu is himself accomplished in virtuous behavior....

(7) "He is himself accomplished in concentration and speaks to the bhikkhus on accomplishment in concentration. This is a ground for praise: 'The bhikkhu is himself accomplished in concentration....'

(10) "He is himself accomplished in the knowledge and vision of liberation and speaks to the bhikkhus on accomplishment in the knowledge and vision of liberation. This is a ground for praise: 'The bhikkhu is himself accomplished in the knowledge and vision of liberation and speaks to the bhikkhus on accomplishment in the knowledge and vision of liberation.'

"These, bhikkhus, are the ten grounds for praise." [131]

On one occasion the Blessed. One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, be observant of virtuous behavior and observant of the Pātimokkha. Dwell restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken them, train in the training rules.

(1) "If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I be pleasing and agreeable to my fellow monks, respected and esteemed by them,' let him fulfill virtuous behavior, be devoted to internal serenity of mind, not neglect the jhānas, be possessed of insight, and resort to empty huts.

(2) "If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I gain robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick,' let him fulfill virtuous behavior... and resort to empty huts.

(3) "If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May the services of those whose robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick I use be of great fruit and benefit to them,' let him fulfill virtuous behavior... and resort to empty huts.

(4) "If a bhikkhu should wish: [132] 'When my deceased relatives and family members, after passing away, remember me
with confidence in their minds, may this be of great fruit and benefit to them,' let him fulfill virtuous behavior ... and resort to empty huts.

(5) "If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I be content with any kind of robe, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick,' let him fulfill virtuous behavior . . . and resort to empty huts.

(6) "If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I patiently endiure cold and heat; hunger and thirst; contact with flies, mosquitoes, wind, the burning sun, and serpents; and rude and offensive ways of speech. May I be able to bear up with arisen bodily feelings that are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, harrowing, disagreeable, sapping one's vitality,' let him fulfill virtuous behavior ... and resort to empty huts.

(7) "If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I become one who vanquishes discontent and delight, and may discontent and delight not vanquish me. May I overcome discontent and delight whenever they arise,' let him fulfill virtuous behavior . . . and resort to empty huts.

(8) "If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I become one who vanquishes fear and terror, and may fear and terror not vanquish me. May I overcome fear and terror whenever they arise,' let him fulfill virtuous behavior . . . and resort to empty huts.

(9) "If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life,' let him fulfill virtuous behavior... and resort to empty huts.

(10) "If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I, with the destruction of the taints, realize for myself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, [133] and having entered upon it, dwell in it,' let him fulfill virtuous behavior, be devoted to internal serenity of mind, not neglect the jhānas, be possessed of insight, and resort to empty huts.

"When it was said: 'Bhikkhus, be observant of virtuous behavior and observant of the Pātimokkha; dwell restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults; having undertaken them, train in the training rules,' it is because of this that this was said."

# 72 (2) Thorns

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood together with a number of very well-known elder disciples: the Venerable Cāla, the Venerable Upacāla, the Venerable Kakkata, the Venerable Katimbha, the Venerable Kata, the Venerable Kațissanga, and other very well-known elder disciples.

Now on that occasion a number of very well-known Licchavis had entered the Great Wood in order to see the Blessed One, and as they followed one another in their finest carriages they made an uproar and a racket. It then occurred to those venerable ones: "A number of very well-known Licchavis have entered the Great Wood in order to see the Blessed One, and as they follow one another in their finest carriages they are making an uproar and a racket. Now the Blessed One has called noise a thorn to the jhānas. Let us go to the Gosinga Sal Woods. [134] There we can dwell at ease, without noise and without any crowds." Then those venerable ones went to the Gosinga Sal Woods, where they dwelt at ease, without noise and crowds.

Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, where is Cāla? Where is Upacāla? Where is Kakkata? Where is Katimbha? Where is Kata? Where is Kațissanga? Where have those elder disciples gone?"

"Bhante, it occurred to those venerable ones: 'A number of very well-known Licchavis . . . are making an uproar and a racket. . . . Let us go to the Gosinga Sal Woods, where we can dwell at ease, without noise and crowds.' So they went to the Gosinga Sal Woods, where they dwell at ease, without noise and crowds."

"Good, good, bhikkhus! Those great disciples spoke rightly when they said that I have called noise a thorn to the jhānas. There are, bhikkhus, these ten thorns. What ten? (1) Delight in company is a thorn to one who delights in solitude. (2) Pursuit of an attractive object is a thorn to one intent on meditation on the mark of the unattractive. (3) An unsuitable show is a thorn to one guarding the doors of the sense faculties. (4) Keeping company with women is a thorn to the celibate life. [135] (5) Noise is a thorn to the first jhāna. (6) Thought and examination are a thorn to the second jhāna. (7) Rapture is a thorn to the
third jhāna. (8) In-and-out breathing is a thorn to the fourth jhāna. (9) Perception and feeling are a thorn to the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling. (10) Lust is a thorn, hatred is a thorn, and delusion is a thorn. Dwell thornless, bhikkhus! Dwell without thorns! The arahants are thornless. The arahants are without thorns. The arahants are thornless and without thorns."

# 73 (3) Wished For

"Bhikkhus, there are these ten things that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world. What ten? (1) Wealth is wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world. (2) Beauty ... (3) Health ... (4) Virtuous behavior ... (5) Celibacy ... (6) Friends ... (7) Learning ... (8) Wisdom ... (9) Good qualities ... (10) The heavens are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world. [136] These are the ten things that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world.

"There are ten [other] things, bhikkhus, that are obstructions to these ten things that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world. (1) Indolence and lack of initiative are obstructions to [the acquisition of] wealth. (2) Not adorning and beautifying oneself are obstructions to beauty. (3) Doing what is unbeneficial is an obstruction to health. (4) Bad friendship is an obstruction to virtuous behavior. (5) Nonrestraint of the sense faculties is an obstruction to celibacy. (6) Duplicity is an obstruction to friendships. (7) Non-recitation is an obstruction to learning. (8) Unwillingness to listen and not asking questions are obstructions to wisdom. (9) Not applying oneself and lack of reflection are obstructions to good qualities. (10) Wrong practice is an obstruction to the heavens. These are the ten [other] things that are obstructions to those ten things that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world.

"There are ten [other] things, bhikkhus, that are nutriments for these ten things that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world. (1) Diligence and initiative are nutriments for [the acquisition of] wealth. (2) Adorning and beautifying oneself are nutriments for beauty. (3) Doing what
is beneficial is a nutriment for health. (4) Good friendship is a nutriment for virtuous behavior. (5) Restraint of the sense facultics is a nutriment for celibacy. (6) Sincerity is a nutriment for friendships. (7) Recitation is a nutriment for learning. (8) Willingness to listen and asking questions are nutriments for wisdom. (9) Applying oneself and reflection are nutriments for good qualities. (10) Right practice is a nutriment for the heavens. These are the ten [other] things that are nutriments for those ten things that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world." [137]

# 74 (4) Growth [^2090]

"Bhikkhus, growing in ten ways, a noble disciple grows by a noble growth, and he absorbs the essence and the best of this life. What ten? (1) He grows in fields and land; (2) in wealth and grain; (3) in wives and children; (4) in slaves, workers, and servants; (5) in livestock; (6)-(10) in faith, virtuous behavior, learning, generosity, and wisdom. Growing in these ten ways, a noble disciple grows by a noble growth, and he absorbs the essence and the best of this life."

One who grows here in wealth and grain, in children, wives, and livestock, is wealthy and famous, honored by relatives, friends, and royalty.

Such a discerning good manwho grows here in faith and virtuous behavior, in wisdom, generosity, and learninggrows in both ways in this life.

## 75 (5) Migasāla [^3091]

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Then, in the morning, the Venerable Ānanda dressed, took his bowl and robe, and went to the house of the female lay follower Migasālā, where he sat down on the seat prepared for him. Then the female lay disciple Migasālā approached the Venerable Ānanda, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:

"Bhante Ānanda, just how should this [138] teaching of the

Blessed One be understood, where one who is celibate and one who is not celibate both have exactly the same destination in their future life? My father Purāna was celibate, living apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the common person's practice. When he died, the Blessed One declared: 'He attained to the state of a once-returner and has been reborn in the Tusita group [of devas].' My paternal uncle Isidatta [^2092] was not celibate but lived a contented married life. When he died, the Blessed One also declared: 'He attained to the state of a once-returner and has been reborn in the Tusita group [of devas].' Bhante Ānanda, just how should this teaching of the Blessed One be understood, where one who is celibate and one who is not celibate both have exactly the same destination in their future life?"

"It was just in this way, sister, that the Blessed One declared it."

Then, when the Venerable Ārianda had received almsfood at Migasālā's house, he rose from his seat and departed. After his meal, on returning from his alms round, he went to the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: "Here, Bhante, in the morning, I dressed, took my bowl and robe, and went to the house of the female lay follower Migasāla....[139] [all as above, down to]... When she asked me this, I replied: 'It was just in this way, sister, that the Blessed One declared it."

[The Blessed One said:] "Who, indeed, is the female lay follower Migasālā, a foolish, incompetent woman with a woman's intellect? And who are those [who have] the knowledge of other persons as superior and inferior? [^2093]

"There are, Ānanda, these ten types of persons found existing in the world. What ten?

(1) "Here, Ānanda, there is one person who is immoral and does not understand as it really is that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, where that immorality of his ceases without remainder. [^2094] And he has not listened [to the teachings], become learned [in them], penetrated [them] by view, and he does not attain temporary liberation. With the breakup of the body, after death, he heads for deterioration, not for distinction; he is one going to deterioration, not to distinction.

(2) "Then, Ānanda, there is one person who is immoral yet understands as it really is that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, [140] where that immorality of his ceases without
remainder. And he has listened [to the teachings], become learned [in them], penetrated [them] by view, and he attains temporary liberation. With the breakup of the body, after death, he heads for distinction, not for deterioration; he is one going to distinction, not to deterioration.

"Ānanda, those who are judgmental will pass such judgment on them: 'This one has the same qualities as the other. Why should one be inferior and the other superior?' That [judgment] of theirs will indeed lead to their harm and suffering for a long time.

"Between them, Ānanda, the person who is immoral, and who understands as it really is that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, where that immorality of his ceases without remainder; who has listened [to the teachings]; become learned [in them], penetrated [them] by view, and who attains temporary liberation, surpasses and excels the other person. For what reason? Because the Dhamma-stream carries him along. But who can know this difference except the Tathāgata?

"Therefore, Ānanda, do not be judgmental regarding people. Do not pass judgment on people. Those who pass judgment on people harm themselves. I alone, or one like me, may pass judgment on people. [141]

(3) "Then, Ānanda, there is one person who is virtuous yet does not understand as it really is that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, where that virtuous behavior of his ceases without remainder. And he has not listened [to the teachings]... he does not attain temporary liberation. With the breakup of the body, after death, he heads for deterioration, not for distinction; he is one going to deterioration, not to distinction.

(4) "Then, Ānanda, there is one person who is virtuous and understands as it really is that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, where that virtuous behavior of his ceases without remainder. And he has listened [to the teachings] . . . and he attains temporary liberation. With the breakup of the body, after death, he heads for distinction, not for deterioration; he is one going to distinction, not to deterioration.

"Ānanda, those who are judgmental will pass such judgment on them . . I alone, or one like me, may pass judgment on people.

(5) "Then, Ānanda, there is one person who is strongly prone
to lust and does not understand as it really is that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, where that lust of his ceases without remainder. And he has not listened [to the teachings]...he does not attain temporary liberation. With the breakup of the body, after death, he heads for deterioration, not for distinction; he is one going to deterioration, not to distinction.

(6) "Then, Ānanda, there is one person who is strongly prone to lust yet understands as it really is that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, where that lust of his ceases without remainder. And he has listened [to the teachings] . . . and he attains temporary liberation. [142] With the breakup of the body, after death, he heads for distinction, not for deterioration; he is one going to distinction, not to deterioration:

"Ānanda, those who are judgmental will pass such judgment on them. . . I alone, or one like me, may pass judgment on people.

(7) "Then, Ā nanda, there is one person who is prone to anger and does not understand as it really is that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, where that anger of his ceases without remainder. And he has not listened [to the teachings]...he does not attain temporary liberation. With the breakup of the body, after death, he heads for deterioration, not for distinction; he is one going to deterioration, not to distinction.

(8) "Then, Ānanda, there is one person who is prone to anger yet understands as it really is that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, where that anger of his ceases without remainder. And he has listened [to the teachings] . . . he attains temporary liberation. With the breakup of the body, after death, he heads for distinction, not for deterioration; he is one going to distinction, not to deterioration.

"Ānanda, those who are judgmental will pass such judgment on them. . . I alone, or one like me, may pass judgment on people.

(9) "Then, Ānanda, there is one person who is restless and does not understand as it really is that liberation of mind liberation by wisdom, where that restlessness of his ceases without remainder. And he has not listened [to the teachings]...he does not attain temporary liberation. With the breakup of the body, after death, he heads for deterioration, not for distinction; he is one going to deterioration, not to distinction.
(10) "Then, Ānanda, there is one person who is restless yet understands as it really is that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, where that restlessness of his ceases without remainder. And he has listened [to the teachings], become learned [in them], penetrated [them] by view, [143] and he attains temporary liberation. With the breakup of the body, after death, he heads for distinction, not for deterioration; he is one going to distinction, not to deterioration.

"Ānanda, those who are judgmental will pass such judgment on them: 'This one has the same qualities as the other. Why should one be inferior and the other superior?' That [judgment] of theirs will indeed lead to their harm and suffering for a long time.

"Between them, Ānanda, the person who is restless; and who understands as it really is that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, where that restlessness of his ceases without remainder; who has listened [to the teachings], become learned [in them], penetrated [them] by view, and who attains temporary liberation, surpasses and excels the other person. For what reason? Because the Dhamma-stream carries him along. But who can know this difference except the Tathāgata?

"Therefore, Ānanda, do not be judgmental regarding people. Do not pass judgment on people. Those who pass judgment on people harm themselves. I alone, or one like me, may pass judgment on people.

"Who, indeed, is the female lay follower Migasālā, a foolish, incompetent woman with a woman's intellect? And who are those [who have] the knowledge of other persons as superior and inferior?

"These are the ten types of persons found existing in the world.

"Ānanda, if Isidatta had possessed the same kind of virtuous behavior that Purāna had, Purāna could not have even known his destination. [144] And if Purāna had possessed the same kind of wisdom that Isidatta had, Isidatta could not have even known his destination. In this way, Ānanda, these two persons were each deficient in one respect."

# IV. The Elders

81 (1) Bāhuna

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Campā on a bank of the Gaggārā Lotus Pond. Then the Venerable Bāhuna approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, from how many things is the Tathāgata released, detached, and emancipated, that he dwells with a mind free from boundaries?" [152]

"Bāhuna, it is because the Tathāgata is released, detached, and emancipated from ten things that he dwells with a mind free from boundaries. What ten? (1) It is because the Tathāgata is released, detached, and emancipated from form that he dwells with a mind free from boundaries. (2)-(5) It is because the Tathāgata is released, detached, and emancipated from feeling . . perception . . . volitional activities . . consciousness that he dwells with a mind free from boundaries. (6)-(10) It is because the Tathāgata is released, detached, and emancipated from birth ... old age . . . death . . . suffering . . . defilements that he dwells with a mind free from boundaries.

"Just as a blue, red, or white lotus flower, though born in the water and grown up in the water, rises up above the water and stands unsoiled by the water, [^2100] even so, Bāhuna, it is because
the Tathāgata is released, detached, and emancipated from these ten things that he dwells with a mind free from boundaries."

# 82 (2) Ānanda

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

(1) "It is impossible, Ānanda, that a bhikkhu without faith will achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline. (2) It is impossible that an immoral bhikkhu...

(8) ... a bhikkhu who is not content ... (9) ... a bhikkhu of evil desires ... (10) ... a bhikkhu who holds wrong view will achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline. It is impossible that a bhikkhu who possesses these ten qualities will achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline.

(1) "It is possible, Ānanda, that a bhikkhu endowed with faith will achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline. (2) It is possible that a virtuous bhikkhu ... (3) ... a bhikkhu of much learning ... (4) ... a bhikkhu who is easy to correct ... (5) ... a bhikkhu who has good friends ... (6) ... an energetic bhikkhu ... (7) ... a mindful bhikkhu ... [154] (8) ... a contented bhikkhu ... (9) ... a bhikkhu of few desires ... (10) ... a bhikkhu who holds right view will achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline. It is possible that a bhikkhu who possesses these ten qualities will achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline."

83 (3) Punniya [^2101]

Then the Venerable Punniya approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, why is it that at times the Tathāgata is disposed to teach the Dhamma and at times is not disposed [to teach]?"

(1) "When, Punniya, a bhikkhu is endowed with faith but does not approach him, the Tathāgata is not disposed to teach the Dhamma. (2) But when a bhikkhu is endowed with faith and approaches him, the Tathāgata is disposed to teach.

(3) "When, Punniya, a bhikkhu is endowed with faith and
approaches him, but he does not attend on him ... (4) When he attends on him but does not ask questions ... (5) When he asks questions but does not listen to the Dhamma with eager ears... (6) When he listens to the Dhamma with eager ears, but having heard it, does not retain it in mind ... (7) When, having heard it, he retains it in mind but does not examine the meaning of the teachings that have been retained in mind ... (8) When he examines the meaning of the teachings that have been retained in mind but does not [155] understand the meaning and the Dhamma and then practice in accordance with the Dhamma... (9) When he understands the meaning and the Dhamma and then practices in accordance with the Dhamma, but he is not a good speaker with a good delivery, one gifted with speech that is polished, clear, articulate, expressive of the meaning ... (10) When he is a good speaker with a good delivery, one gifted with speech that is polished, clear, articulate, expressive of the meaning, but he does not instruct, encourage, inspire, and gladden his fellow monks, the Tathāgata is not disposed to teach the Dhamma.

"But, Punniya, (1) when a bhikkhu is endowed with faith, (2) approaches [the Tathāgata], (3) attends on [the Tathāgata], (4) asks questions, and (5) listens to the Dhamma with eager ears; and (6) having heard the Dhamma, he retains it in mind, (7) examines the meaning of the teachings he has retained in mind, and (8) understands the meaning and the Dhamma and then practices in accordance with the Dhamma; and (9) he is a good speaker with a good delivery, one gifted with speech that is polished, clear, articulate, expressive of the meaning; and (10) he instructs, encourages, inspires, and gladdens his fellow monks, the Tathāgata is disposed to teach the Dhamma. When, Punniya, one possesses these ten qualities, the Tathāgata is entirely disposed to teach the Dhamma."

# 84 (4) Declaration

There the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend," those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this:

"Here, friends, a bhikkhu declares final knowledge thus: 'I understand: "Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming
back to any state of being." The Tathāgata [156] or his disciple who is a jhāna-attainer-skilled in attainment, skilled in others' minds, skilled in the ways of others' minds-questions him, interrogates him, and cross-examines him. When he is being questioned, interrogated, and cross-examined by the Tathāgata or his disciple, he comes to an impasse and is flustered. He meets with calamity, meets with disaster, meets with calamity and disaster.

"The Tathāgata or his disciple who is a jhāna-attainer . . . encompasses his mind with his own mind and considers: 'Why does this venerable one declare final knowledge thus: "I understand: 'Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.'"?' The Tathāgata or his disciple, having encompassed his mind with his own mind, understands:

(1) "This venerable one is prone to anger and his mind is often obsessed by anger. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, obsession by anger is a case of decline.

(2) "'This venerable one is hostile and his mind is often obsessed by hostility. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, obsession by hostility is a case of decline.

(3) "'This venerable one is prone to denigration and his mind is often obsessed by denigration. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, obsession by denigration is a case of decline.

(4) "'This venerable one is insolent and his mind is often obsessed by insolence. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, obsession by insolence is a case of decline.

(5) "'This venerable one is envious and his mind is often obsessed by envy. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, obsession by envy is a case of decline.

(6) "'This venerable one is misery and his mind is often obsessed by miserliness. [157] But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, obsession by miserliness is a case of decline.

(7) "'This venerable one is crafty and his mind is often obsessed by craftiness. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, obsession by craftiness is a case of decline.
(8) "This venerable one is deceitful and his mind is often obsessed by deceitfulness. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, obsession by deceitfulness is a case of decline.

(9) "'This venerable one has evil desires and his mind is often obsessed by desire. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, obsession by desire is a case of decline.

(10) "When there is something further to be done, [^2102] this venerable one comes to a stop along the way on account of some lower achievement of distinction. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, coming to a stop along the way is a case of decline.'

"Truly, friends, it is impossible for a bhikkhu who has not abandoned these ten things to achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline. But it is possible for a bhikkhu who has abandoned these ten things to achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline."

# 85 (5) The Boaster

On one occasion the Venerable Mahācunda was dwelling among the Cetis at Sahajāti. There the Venerable Mahācunda addressed the bhikkhus:

"Friends, bhikkhüs!"

"Friend!" those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Mahācunda said this:

"Here, friends, a bhikkhu is a boaster, one who brags about achievements: 'I attain and emerge from the first jhāna. I attain and emerge from the second jhāna . . . the third jhāna . . . the fourth jhāna ... [158] . . . the base of the infinity of space . . the base of the infinity of consciousness ... the base of nothingness ... the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. I attain and emerge from the cessation of feeling and perception.' The Tathāgata or his disciple who is a jhāna-attainer-skilled in attainment, skilled in others' minds, skilled in the ways of others' minds-questions him, interrogates him, and crossexamines him. When he is being questioned, interrogated, and cross-examined by the Tathāgata or by his disciple, he comes to an impasse and is flustered. He meets with calamity, meets with disaster, meets with calamity and disaster.
"The Tathāgata or his disciple who is a jhāna-attainer . . . encompasses his mind with his own mind and considers: 'Why is this venerable one a boaster, one who brags about achievements: "I attain and emerge from the first jhāna ... I attain and emerge from the cessation of feeling and perception"?' The Tathāgata or his disciple, having encompassed his mind with his own mind, understands:

(1) "'For a long time this venerable one's conduct has been broken, flawed, blemished, and blotched, and he does not consistently observe and follow virtuous behavior. This venerable one is immoral. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, immorality is a case of decline.

(2) "'This venerable one is without faith. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, lack of faith is a case of decline.

(3) "'This venerable one is of little learning and without proper conduct. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, little learning is a case of decline. [159]

(4) "'This venerable one is difficult to correct. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, being difficult to correct is a case of decline.

(5) "'This venerable one has bad friends. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, bad friendship is a case of decline.

(6) "'This venerable one is lazy. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, laziness is a case of decline.

(7) "'This venerable one is muddle-minded. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, muddlemindedness is a case of decline.

(8) "'This venerable one is a deeèver. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, deceitfulness is a case of decline.

(9) "'This venerable one is difficult to support. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, being difficult to support is a case of decline.

(10) "'This venerable one is unwise. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, lack of wisdom is a case of decline.'

"Suppose, friends, that one man would say to his companion:
'Whenever you need money for anything, my friend, just ask me and I'll give it to you.' When the companion has need of money, he says to his friend: 'I need money, friend. Give me some.' The other says: 'In that case, friend, dig here.' He digs there but doesn't find anything. He then says: 'You lied to me, friend, you spoke falsely when you told me to dig here.' The other says: 'I didn't lie to you, friend, I didn't speak falsely. Rather, dig there.' He digs there as well but doesn't find anything. Again, he says: 'You lied to me, friend, you spoke falsely when you told me to dig there.' The other says: 'I didn't lie to you, friend, I didn't speak falsely. [160] Rather, dig there.' He digs there as well but doesn't find anything. He then says: 'You lied to me, friend, you spoke falsely when you told me to dig there. [^2103] The other says: 'I didn't lie to you, friend, I didn't speak falsely. I was insane, out of my mind.'

"So too, friends, a bhikkhu is a boaster, one who brags about achievements: 'I attain and emerge from the first jhāna.'... [all as above down to:] [161]... (10) 'This venerable one is unwise. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, lack of wisdom is a case of decline.'

"Truly, friends, it is impossible for a bhikkhu who has not abandoned these ten things to achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline. But it is possible for a bhikkhu who has abandoned these ten things to achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline."

# 86 (6) Final Knowledge

On one occasion the Venerable Mahākassapa was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. There the Venerable [162] Mahākassapa addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend," those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Mahākassapa said this:

"Here, friends, a bhikkhu declares final knowledge thus: 'I understand: "Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being."' The Tathāgata or his disciple who is a jhāna-attainer-skilled in attainment, skilled in others' minds, skilled in the ways of others' minds-questions him, interrogates him, and cross-examines him. When he is being
questioned, interrogated, and cross-examined by the Tathāgata or his disciple, he comes to an impasse and is flustered. He meets with calamity, meets with disaster, meets with calamity and disaster.

"The Tathāgata or his disciple who is a jhāna-attainer . . . encompasses his mind with his own mind and considers: 'Why does this venerable one declare final knowledge thus: "I understand: 'Destroyed is birth . . . there is no more coming back to any state of being"'?' The Tathāgata or his disciple, having encompassed his mind with his own mind, understands: 'This venerable one overestimates himself, imagines that his estimate of himself is valid, thinks that he has attained what he has not attained, accomplished what he has not accomplished, and achieved what he has not achieved, and by overestimation of himself he declares final knowledge thus: "I understand: 'Destroyed is birth . . . there is no more coming back to any state of being.'"

"The Tathāgata or his disciple who is a jhāna-attainer . . . encompasses his mind with his own mind and considers: 'Why does this venerable one overestimate himself and imagine that his estimate of himself is valid; why does he think that he has attained what he has not attained, accomplished what he has not accomplished, and achieved what he has not achieved; and why, by overestimation of himself, does he declare final knowledge thus: "I understand: 'Destroyed is [163] birth . . . there is no more coming back to any state of being"'?'

"The Tathāgata or his disciple who is a jhāna-attainer ... having encompassed his mind with his own mind, understands: 'This venerable one has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and accumulates what he has learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life-such teachings as these he has learned much of, retained in mind, recited verbally, investigated mentally, and penetrated well by view. Therefore this venerable one overestimates himself and imagines that his estimate of himself is valid; he thinks that he has attained what he has not attained, accomplished what he has not accomplished, and achieved what he has not achieved; and by overestimation of himself he declares final knowledge
thus: "I understand: 'Destroyed is birth . . . there is no more coming back to any state of being.'"

"The Tathāgata or his disciple who is a jhāna-attainer ... having encompassed his mind with his own mind, understands:

(1) "'This venerable one is full of longing and his mind is often obsessed by longing. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, obsession by longing is a case of decline.

(2) "'This venerable one is full of ill will and his mind is often obsessed by ill will. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, obsession by ill will is a case of decline.

(3) "'This venerable one is given to dullness and drowsiness and his mind is often obsessed by dullness and drowsiness. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, obsession by dullness and drowsiness is a case of decline.

(4) "'This venerable one is restless and his mind is often obsessed by restlessness. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, obsession by restlessness is a case of decline.

(5) "'This venerable one is given to doubt and his mind is often obsessed by doubt. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, obsession by doubt is a case of decline.

(6) "'This venerable one delights in work, takes delight in work, is devoted to delight in work. [164] But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, delight in work is a case of decline.

(7) "'This venerable one delights in talk, takes delight in talk, is devoted to delight in talk. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, delight in talk is a case of decline.

(8) "'This venerable one delights in sleep, takes delight in sleep, is devoted to delight in sleep. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, delight in sleep is a case of decline.

(9) "'This venerable one delights in company, takes delight in company, is devoted to delight in company. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, delight in company is a case of decline.
(10) "When there is something further to be done, [^2104] this venerable one comes to a stop along the way on account of some lower achievement of distinction. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, coming to a stop along the way is a case of decline.'

"Truly, friends, it is impossible for a bhikkhu who has not abandoned these ten things to achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline. But it is possible for a bhikkhu who has abandoned these ten things to achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline."

# 87 (7) Disciplinary Issues

There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus with reference to the bhikkhu Kalandaka: [^2105] "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied.

The Blessed One said this:

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is a maker of disciplinary issues and he does not speak in praise of the settlement of disciplinary issues. When a bhikkhu is a maker of disciplinary issues and does not speak in praise of the settlement of disciplinary issues, this is a quality that does not lead to affection, respect, esteem, accord, or unity. [^2106][165]

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu does not desire training and he does not speak in praise of undertaking the training. When a bhikkhu does not desire training ... this, too, is a quality that does not lead to ... unity.

(3) "Again, a bhikkhu has evil desires and he does not speak in praise of the removal of desire. When a bhikkhu has evil desires ... this, too, is a quality that does not lead to ... unity.

(4) "Again, a bhikkhu is prone to anger and he does not speak in praise of the removal of anger. When a bhikkhu is prone to anger ... this, too, is a quality that does not lead to ... unity.

(5) "Again, a bhikkhu is one who denigrates [others] and he does not speak in praise of the removal of denigration. When a bhikkhu is one who denigrates ... this, too, is a quality that does not lead to ... unity.

(6) "Again, a bhikkhu is crafty and he does not speak in praise of the removal of craftiness. When a bhikkhu is crafty . . this, too, is a quality that does not lead to ... unity.

(7) "Again, a bhikkhu is deceitful and he does not speak
in praise of the removal of deceitfulness. When a bhikkhu is deceitful ... this, too, is a quality that does not lead to ... unity. [166]

(8) "Again, a bhikkhu is not inclined to pay attention to teachings and he does not speak in praise of paying attention to teachings. When a bhikkhu is not inclined to pay attention to teachings . . . this, too, is a quality that does not lead to . . . unity.

(9) "Again, a bhikkhu is not inclined to seclusion and he does not speak in praise of seclusion. When a bhikkhu is not inclined to seclusion ... this, too, is a quality that does not lead to . . . unity.

(10) "Again, a bhikkhu does not show hospitality to his fellow monks and he does not speak in praise of one who shows hospitality. When a bhikkhu does not show hospitality to his fellow monks and he does not speak in praise of one who shows hospitality, this, too, is a quality that does not lead to affection, respect, esteem, accord, or unity.

"Although such a bhikkhu might wish: 'Oh, if only my fellow monks would honor, respect, esteem, and venerate me!' yet his fellow monks do not honor, respect, esteem, and venerate him. For what reason? Because his wise fellow monks see that he has not abandoned those bad unwholesome qualities.

"Suppose a wild colt would wish: 'Oh, if only people would assign me a thoroughbred's place, feed me a thoroughbred's food, and give me a thoroughbred's grooming!' yet people do not assign him a thoroughbred's place, feed him a thoroughbred's food, and give him a thoroughbred's grooming. [167] For what reason? Because wise people see that he has not abandoned his tricks, ploys, gambits, and wiles. So too, although such a bhikkhu might wish: 'Oh, if only my fellow monks would honor, respect, esteem, and venerate me!' yet his fellow monks do not honor, respect, esteem, and venerate him. For what reason? Because his wise fellow monks see that he has not abandoned those bad unwholesome qualities.

(1) "But a bhikkhu is not a maker of disciplinary issues and he speaks in praise of the settlement of disciplinary issues. When a bhikkhu is not a maker of disciplinary issues and speaks in praise of the settlement of disciplinary issues, this is a quality that leads to affection, respect, esteem, accord, and unity.
(2) "Again, a bhikkhu desires training and he speaks in praise of undertaking the training. When a bhikkhu desires training this, too, is a quality that leads to ... unity.

(3) "Again, a bhikkhu has few desires and he speaks in praise of the removal of desire. When a bhikkhu has few desires ... this, too, is a quality that leads to ... unity.

(4) "Again, a bhikkhu is not prone to anger and he speaks in praise of the removal of anger. When a bhikkhu is not prone to anger...this, too, is a quality that leads to ... unity.

(5) "Again, a bhikkhu is not one who denigrates [others] and he speaks in praise of the removal of denigration. When a bhikkhu is not one who denigrates [others] ... this, too, is a quality that leads to ... unity. [168]

(6) "Again, a bhikkhu is not crafty and he speaks in praise of the removal of craftiness. When a bhikkhu is not crafty ... this, too, is a quality that leads to ... unity.

(7) "Again, a bhikkhu is not deceitful and he speaks in praise of the removal of deceitfulness. When a bhikkhu is not deceitful this, too, is a quality that leads to ... unity.

(8) "Again, a bhikkhu is inclined to attend to teachings and he speaks in praise of attending to teachings. When a bhikkhu is inclined to attend to teachings ... this, too, is a quality that leads to ... unity.

(9) "Again, a bhikkhu is inclined to seclusion and he speaks in praise of seclusion. When a bhikkhu is inclined to seclusion this, too, is a quality that leads to ... unity.

(10) "Again, a bhikkhu shows hospitality to his fellow monks and he speaks in praise of one who shows hospitality. When a bhikkhu shows hospitality to his fellow monks and he speaks in praise of one who shows hospitality, this, too, is a quality that leads to affection, respect, esteem, accord, and unity.

"Although such a bhikkhu might not wish: 'Oh, if only my fellow monks would honor, respect, esteem, and venerate me!' yet his fellow monks honor, respect, esteem, and venerate him. For what reason? Because his wise fellow monks see that he has abandoned those bad unwholesome qualities.

"Suppose an excellent thoroughbred horse would not wish: 'Oh, if only people would assign me a thoroughbred's place, feed me a thoroughbred's food, and give me a thoroughbred's grooming!' yet people assign him a thoroughbred's place, feed
him a thoroughbred's food, [169] and give him a thoroughbred's grooming. For what reason? Because wise people see that he has abandoned his tricks, ploys, gambits, and wiles. So too, although such a bhikkhu might not wish: 'Oh, if only my fellow monks would honor, respect, esteem, and venerate me!' yet his fellow monks honor, respect, esteem, and venerate him. For what reason? Because his wise fellow monks see that he has abandoned those bad unwholesome qualities."

88 (8) One Who Insults [^2107]

"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is one who insults and disparages his fellow monks, a reviler of the noble ones, it is impossible and inconceivable that he will not incur at least one of these ten disasters. What ten? (1) He does not achieve what he has not yet achieved. (2) He falls away from what he has achieved. (3) His good qualities are not polished. [^2108] (4) He overestimates his good qualities, or (5) leads the spiritual life dissatisfied, or (6) commits a certain defiled offense, or (7) contracts a severe illness, or (8) goes mad and becomes mentally deranged. (9) He dies confused. (10) With the breakup of the body; after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. When a bhikkhu is one who insults and disparages his fellow monks, a reviler of the noble ones, it is impossible and inconceivable that he will not incur at least one of these ten disasters." [170]

89 (9) Kokālika [^2109]

Then the bhikkhu Kokālika approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: "Bhante, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have evil desires and have come under the control of evil desires."

[The Blessed One replied:] "Do not say so, Kokālika! Do notsay so, Kokālika! [^2110] Place confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, Kokālika. Sāriputta and Moggallāna are well behaved."

A second time the bhikkhu Kokālika said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, although I consider the Blessed One worthy of faith and trust, [I still say that] Sāriputta and Moggallāna have evil desires and have come under the control of evil desires."

"Do not say so, Kokālika!... Sāriputta and Moggallāna are well behaved."

A third time the bhikkhu Kokālika said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, although I consider the Blessed One worthy of faith and trust, [I still say that] Sāriputta and Moggallāna have evil desires and have come under the control of evil desires."

"Do not say so, Kokālika! Do not say so, Kokālika! Place confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, Kokālika. Sāriputta and Moggallāna are well behaved."

Then the bhikkhu Kokālika rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated the Blessed One keeping the right side toward him, and departed. Not long after the bhikkhu Kokālika had left, his entire body became covered with boils the size of mustard seeds. These then grew to the size of mung beans; then to the size of chickpeas; then to the size of jujube pits; then to the size of jujube fruits; then to the size of myrobalans; then to the size of unripe belli fruits; [^2111] then to the size of ripe belli fruits. When they had grown to the size of ripe belli fruits, they burst open, [171] exuding pus and blood. He then just lay on banana leaves like a fish that had swallowed poison.

Then the independent brahmā Tudu approached the bhikkhu Kokālika, [^2112] stood in the air, and said to him: "Place confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, Kokālika. Sāriputta and Moggallāna are well behaved."

"Who are you, friend?"

"I am the independent brahmā Tudu."

"Didn't the Blessed One declare you to be a non-returner, friend? Then why have you come back here? See how much wrong you have done. [^2113]

Then the independent brahmā Tudu addressed the bhikkhu Kokālika in verse:

"When a person has taken birth an axe is born inside his mouth with which the fool cuts himself by uttering wrongful speech.

"He who praises one deserving blame [^2114] or blames one deserving praise casts with his mouth an unlucky throw by which he finds no happiness.
"Slight is the unlucky throw at dice that results in the loss of one's wealth, [the loss] of all, oneself included; much worse is this unlucky throw of harboring hate against the holy ones.

"For a hundred thousand and thirty-six nirabbudas, plus five abbudas, [^2115] the slanderer of noble ones goes to hell, having defamed them with evil speech and mind." [172]

Then the bhikkhu Kokālika died on account of that illness, and because of his resentment against Sāriputta and Moggallāna, after death he was reborn in the red-lotus hell. [^2116]

Then, when the night had advanced, Brahmā Sahampati, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta's Grove, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and said to him: "Bhante, the bhikkhu Kokālika has died, and because of his resentment against Sāriputta and Moggallāna, after death he has been reborn in the red-lotus hell." This is what Brahmā Sahampati said. He then paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and disappeared right there.

Then, when the night had passed, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, last night, when the night had advanced, Brahmā Sahampati approached me and said to me ...[as above]... He then paid homage to me, circumambulated me keeping the right side toward me, and disappeared right there."

When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "How long, Bhante, is the life span in the red-lotus hell?"2117

"The life span in the red-lotus hell is long, bhikkhu. It is not easy to count it and say it is so many [173] years, or so many hundreds of years, or so many thousands of years, or so many hundreds of thousands of years."

"Then is it possible, Bhante, to give a simile?"

"It is, bhikkhu," the Blessed One said. "Suppose there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty measures of sesamum seed. At the end of every hundred years a man would remove one seed from it. In this manner the Kosalan cartload of twenty measures of
sesamum seed might be depleted and eliminated more quickly than (1) a life in a single abbuda hell would go by. (2) One life in the nirabbuda hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the abbuda hell; (3) one life in the ababa hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the nirabbuda hell; (4) one life in the ahaha hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the ababa hell; (5) one life in the atata hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the ahaha hell; (6) one life in the water-lily hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the atata hell; (7) one life in the sweet-fragrance hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the water-lily hell; (8) one life in the blue-lotus hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the sweet-fragrance hell; (9) one life in the white-lotus hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the blue-lotus hell; and (10) one life in the red-lotus hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the white-lotus hell. Now, because he harbored resentment against Sāriputta and Moggallāna, the bhikkhu Kokālika has been reborn in the red-lotus hell."

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this: [174]

[The four verses are identical with those just above.]

90 (10) Powers [^2118]

Then the Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Sāriputta, when a bhikkhu's taints have been destroyed, how many powers does he possess by reason of which he can claim [to have attained] the destruction of the taints: 'My taints have been destroyed'?"

"Bhante, when a bhikkhu's taints have been destroyed, he possesses ten powers by reason of which he can claim [to have attained] the destruction of the taints: 'My taints have been destroyed.' What ten?

(1) "Here, Bhante, a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has clearly seen all conditioned phenomena as they really are with correct wisdom as impermanent. [175] This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed on the basis of which he claims [to have attained] the destruction of the taints: 'My taints have been destroyed.'

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has clearly seen sensual pleasures as they really are with correct wisdom as
similar to a charcoal pit. This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed...

(3) "Again, the mind of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed slants, slopes, and inclines to seclusion; it is withdrawn, delights in renunciation, and is entirely finished with all things that are a basis for the taints. This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed...

(4) "Again, a bhikkhu with taints' destroyed has developed and well developed the four establishments of mindfulness: This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed...

(5)-(10) "Again, a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has developed and well developed the four right strivings ... the four bases for psychic potency ... the five spiritual faculties . . . the five powers [176] . . . the seven factors of enlightenment . . . the noble eightfold path. This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed on the basis of which he claims [to have attained] the destruction of the taints: 'My taints have been destroyed.'

"Bhante, when a bhikkhu's taints have been destroyed, he possesses these ten powers by reason of which he can claim [to have attained] the destruction of the taints: 'My taints have been destroyed.'"

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Then the householder Anāthapindika approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him: [177]

# [Conclusion]

"These, householder, are the ten kinds of persons who enjoy sensual pleasures found existing in the world. Of these ten, [182] the foremost, the best, the preeminent, the supreme, and the finest is the one enjoying sensual pleasures who seeks wealth righteously, without violence, and having obtained it, makes himself happy and pleased; and shares the wealth and does meritorious deeds; and uses that wealth without being. tied to it, infatuated with it, and blindly absorbed in it, seeing the danger in it and understanding the escape. Just as from a cow comes milk, from milk curd, from curd butter, from butter ghee, and from ghee comes cream-of-ghee, which is reckoned the foremost of all these, so too, of these ten kinds of persons who enjoy sensual pleasures, the foremost, the best, the preeminent, the supreme, and the finest is the one who seeks wealth righteously, without violence, and having obtained it, makes himself happy and pleased; and shares the wealth and does meritorious deeds; and uses that wealth without being tied to it, infatuated with it, and blindly absorbed in it, seeing the danger in it and understanding the escape."

92 (2) Enmity [^2122]

Then the householder Anāthapindika approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Householder, when a noble disciple has eliminated five perils and enmities, possesses the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and thoroughly penetrated with wisdom the noble method, he might, if he so wished, declare of himself: 'I am one finished with hell, the animal realm, and the sphere of afflicted spirits; finished with the plane of misery, the bad destination, the lower world; I am a stream-enterer, no longer subject to [rebirth in] the lower world, fixed in destiny, heading for enlightenment.'

"What are the five perils and enmities that have been eliminated? [183] (1) Householder, one who destroys life, with the destruction of life as condition, creates peril and enmity pertaining to the present life and peril and enmity pertaining to future lives, and he also experiences mental pain and dejection. One who abstains from the destruction of life does not create such peril and enmity pertaining to the present life or such peril and enmity pertaining to future lives, nor does he experience mental pain and dejection. For one who abstains from the destruction of life, that peril and enmity has thus been eliminated.

(2) "One who takes what is not given...(3) One who engages in sexual misconduct...(4) One who speaks falsely...(5) One who indulges in liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, with indulgence in liquor, wine, and intoxicants as condition, creates peril and enmity pertaining to the present life and peril and enmity pertaining to future lives, and he also experiences mental pain and dejection. One who abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, does not create such peril and enmity pertaining to the present life or such peril and enmity pertaining to future lives, nor does he experience mental pain and dejection. For one who abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, that peril and enmity has thus been eliminated.

"These are the five perils and enmities that have been eliminated.

" "And what are the four factors of stream-entry that he possesses? (6) Here, householder, a noble disciple possesses
unwavering confidence in the Buddha thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' (7) He possesses unwavering confidence in the Dhamma thus: 'The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.' (8) He possesses unwavering confidence in the Sangha thus: 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is practicing the good way, practicing the straight way, practicing the true way, practicing the proper way; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals-this Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.' (9) He possesses the virtuous behavior loved by the noble ones, [184] unbroken, flawless, unblemished, unblotched, freeing, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading to concentration. These are the four factors of stream-entry that he possesses.

"And what is the noble method that he has clearly seen and thoroughly penetrated with wisdom? [^2123] (10) Here, householder, the noble disciple reflects thus: 'When this exists, that comes to be; with the arising of this, that arises. When this does not exist, that does not come to be; with the cessation of this, that ceases. That is, with ignorance as condition, volitional activities [come to be]; with volitional activities as condition, consciousness; with consciousness as condition, name-and-form; with name-and-form as condition, the six sense bases; with the six sense bases as condition, contact; with contact as condition, feeling; with feeling as condition, craving; with craving as condition, clinging; with clinging as condition, existence; with existence as condition, birth; with birth as condition, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish come to be. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.

"But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional activities; with the cessation of volitional activities, cessation of consciousness; with the cessation of consciousness, cessation of name-and-form; with the cessation of name-and-form, cessation of the six sense
bases; with the cessation of the six sense bases, cessation of contact; with the cessation of contact, cessation of feeling; with the cessation of feeling, cessation of craving; with the cessation of craving, cessation of clinging; with the cessation of clinging, cessation of existence; with the cessation of existence, cessation of birth; with the cessation of birth, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish cease. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.'

"This is the noble method that he has clearly seen and thoroughly penetrated with wisdom.

"Householder, when a noble disciple has eliminated these five perils and enmities, and he possesses these four factors of stream-entry, and he has clearly seen and thoroughly penetrated with wisdom this noble method, he might, if he so wished, declare of himself: 'I am one finished with hell, the animal realm, and the sphere of afflicted spirits; finished with the plane of misery, the bad destination, the lower world; I am a stream-enterer, no longer subject to [rebirth in] the lower world, fixed in destiny, heading for enlightenment.'" [185]

# 93 (3) View

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Then the householder Anāthapindika left Sāvatthī in the middle of the day in order to see the Blessed One. It then occurred to him: "It is not the proper time to see the Blessed One, who is in seclusion, nor to see the esteemed bhikkhus, who are also in seclusion. Let me go to the park of the wanderers of other sects."

Then the householder Anāthapindika went to the park of the wanderers of other sects. Now on that occasion the wanderers of other sects had assembled and were making an uproar as they loudly and boisterously sat discussing various pointless topics. The wanderers saw the householder Anāthapindika coming in the distance and silenced one another: "Sirs, be quiet. Sirs, do not make any noise. Here comes the householder Anāthapindika, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, one among the ascetic Gotama's white-robed lay disciples who reside in Sāvatthī. Now these venerable ones are fond of quiet, disciplined in quiet, and speak in praise of quiet. Perhaps if he finds that our assembly is quiet, he will think to approach us." Then those wanderers of other sects became silent.

Then the householder Anāthapindika approached those wanderers and exchanged greetings with them. When they had concluded their greetings [186] and cordial talk, he sat down to one side. The wanderers then said to him:

"Tell us, householder, what is the ascetic Gotama's view?"

"Bhante, I don't know the Blessed One's view in its entirety."

"So, householder, you say you don't know the ascetic Gotama's view in its entirety. Then tell us, what is the bhikkhus' view?"

"Bhante, I also don't know the bhikkhus' view in its entirety."

"So, householder, you say you don't know the ascetic Gotama's view in its entirety and you also don't know the bhikkhus' view in its entirety. Then tell us, what is your view?"

"It isn't hard for me to explain my view, Bhante. But first explain your own views. Afterward it won't be hard for me to explain my view."

When this was said, one wanderer said to the householder Anāthapindika: (1) "'The world is eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong': such is my view, householder." (2) Another wanderer said: "'The world is non-eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong': such is my view, householder." (3)-(4) Still another said: "'The world is finite' ... 'The world is infinite' ... (5)-(6) 'The soul and the body are the same' ... 'The soul is one thing, the body another' ... (7)-(10) 'The Tathāgata exists after death'... 'The Tathāgata does not exist after death'... 'The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death' . . 'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death'; this alone is true, anything else is wrong: such is my view, householder. [^2124]

When this was said, the householder Anāthapindika said to those wanderers: "Bhante, this venerable one said thus: "The world is eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wriag": such is my view, [187] householder.' This view of is as arisen because of his own careless attention or conditioner by someone else's utterance. Now this view has come into being and is conditioned, a product of volition, dependently originated. But whatever has come into being and is conditioned, a product of volition, dependently originated; is impermanent. Whatever is impermanent is suffering. It is just suffering that he is attached to and holds to.
"Bhante, this [other] venerable one said thus: "The world is non-eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong": such is my view, householder.' This view of his has also arisen because of his own careless attention or conditioned by someone else's utterance. Now this view has come into being and is conditioned, a product of volition, dependently originated. But whatever has come into being and is conditioned, a product of volition, dependently originated, is impermanent. Whatever is impermanent is suffering. It is just suffering that he is attached to and holds to.

"Bhante, this venerable one said thus: "The world is finite". ..."The world is infinite" ..."The soul and the body are the same" ..."The soul is one thing, the body another" ..."The Tathāgata exists after death" ..."The Tathāgata does not exist after death" ..."The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death" ..."The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death"; this alone is true, anything else is wrong: such is my view, householder.' This view of his has also arisen because of his own careless attention or conditioned by someone else's utterance. Now this view has come into being and is conditioned, a product of volition, dependently originated. But whatever has come into being and is conditioned, a product of volition, dependently originated, is impermanent. Whatever is impermanent is suffering. It is just suffering that he is attached to and holds to." [188]

When this was said, those wanderers said to the householder Anāthapindika: "We have each explained our own views, householder. Now tell us your view."

"Bhante, whatever has come into being and is conditioned, a product of volition, dependently originated, is impermanent. Whatever is impermanent is suffering. Whatever is suffering is not mine; I am not this; this is not my self. That is my view."

"Householder, whatever has come into being and is conditioned, a product of volition, dependently originated, is impermanent. Whatever is impermanent is suffering. It is just suffering that you are attached to and hold to."

"Bhante, whatever has come into being and is conditioned, a product of volition, dependently originated, is impermanent. Whatever is impermanent is suffering. Having clearly seen what is suffering as it really is with correct wisdom thus: 'This
is not mine; I am not this; this is not my self,' I understand as it really is the superior escape from it."

When this was said, those wanderers sat silenced, disconcerted, hunched over, downcast, glum, and speechless. Then the householder Anāthapindika, having understood that those wanderers [sat] silenced . . . and speechless, rose from his seat and went to the Blessed One. He paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side, and reported to the Blessed One his entire conversation with those wanderers.

[The Blessed One said:] "Good, good, householder! It is in such a way that those hollow men should from time to time be thoroughly refuted with reasoned argument. [^2125] Then the Blessed One instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened the householder Anāthapindika with a Dhamma talk. Then, when the householder Anāthapindika had been instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened by the Blessed One with a Dhamma talk, [189] he rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed.

Then, not long after the householder Anāthapindika had left, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, if any bhikkhu, even one ordained for a hundred years in this Dhamma and discipline, would thoroughly refute with reasoned argument the wanderers of other sects, he would refute them just as the householder Anāthapindika has done."

# 94 (4) Vajjiyamāhita

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Campā on a bank of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. Then the householder Vajjiyamāhita left Campā in the middle of the day to see the Blessed One. It then occurred to him: "It is not the proper time to see the Blessed One, who is in seclusion, nor to see the esteemed bhikkhus, who are also in seclusion. Let me go to the park of the wanderers of other sects."

Then the householder Vajjiyamāhita went to the park of the wanderers of other sects ... [all as in 10:93] [190] ...

Then the householder Vajjiyamāhita approached those wanderers and exchanged greetings with them. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side. The wanderers then said to him:
"Is it true, householder, as it is said, that the ascetic Gotama criticizes all austerities and that he unreservedly condemns and reproves all who live a harsh and austere life?"

"No, Bhante, the Blessed One does not criticize all austerities and he does not unreservedly condemn and reprove all who live a harsh and austere life. The Blessed One criticizes what deserves criticism and praises what is praiseworthy. By criticizing what deserves criticism and praising what is praiseworthy, the Blessed One speaks on the basis of distinctions; he does not speak about such matters one-sidedly." [^2126]

When this was said, a wanderer said to the householder Vajjiyamāhita: "Wait a moment, householder! That ascetic Gotama whom you are praising is an abolitionist who refrains from making definite declarations."

"I will deal with that point, too, Bhante. The Blessed One has validly declared: 'This is wholesome' and: 'This is unwholesome.' Thus, when he declares what is wholesome and what is unwholesome, the Blessed One makes definite declarations. He is not an abolitionist who refrains from making definite declarations."

When this was said, those wanderers [191] sat silenced, disconcerted, hunched over, downcast, glum, and speechless. Then the householder Vajjiyamāhita, having understood that those wanderers [sat] silenced ... and speechless, rose from his seat and went to the Blessed One. He paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side, and reported to the Blessed One his entire conversation with those wanderers of other sects.

[The Blessed One said:] "Good, good, householder! It is in such a way that those hollow men should from time to time be thoroughly refuted with reasoned argument."

(1)-(2) "I do not say, householder, of every kind of austerity that it should be practiced; nor do I say of every kind of austerity that it should not be practiced. (3)-(4) I do not say of every observance that it should be undertaken; nor do I say of every observance that it should not be undertaken. (5)-(6) I do not say that one should strive in every way; nor do I say that one should not strive in any way. (7)-(8) I do not say that one should make every kind of relinquishment; nor do I say that one should not make any kind of relinquishment. (9)-(10) I do not say that one should attain every kind of liberation; nor do I say that one should not attain any kind of liberation.
(1)-(2) "If, householder, when one practices a particular austerity, unwholesome qualities increase and wholesome qualities decline, then, I say, one should not practice such austerity. But if, when one practices a particular austerity, unwholesome qualities decline and wholesome [192] qualities increase, then, I say, one should practice such austerity.

(3)-(4) "If, householder, when one undertakes a particular observance, unwholesome qualities increase and wholesome qualities decline, then, I say, one should not undertake such an observance. But if, when one undertakes a particular observance, unwholesome qualities decline and wholesome qualities increase, then, I say, one should undertake such an observance.

(5)-(6) "If, householder, when one strives in a particular way, unwholesome qualities increase and wholesome qualities decline, then, I say, one should not strive in such a way. But if, when one strives in a particular way, unwholesome qualities decline and wholesome qualities increase, then, I say, one should strive in such a way.

(7)-(8) "If, householder, when one relinquishes something, unwholesome qualities increase and wholesome qualities decline, then, I say, one should not make such a relinquishment. But if, when one relinquishes something, unwholesome qualities decline and wholesome qualities increase, then, I say, one should make such a relinquishment.

(9)-(10) "If, householder, when one attains a particular liberation, unwholesome qualities increase and wholesome qualities decline, then, I say, one should not attain such a liberation. But if, when one attains a particular liberation, unwholesome qualities decline and wholesome qualities increase, then, I say, one should attain such a liberation."

Then, when the householder Vajjiyamāhita had been instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened by the Blessed One with a Dhamma talk, he rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed.

Then, not long after the householder Vajjiyamāhita had left, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, if an: bhikkhu, even one who has long had little dust in his eycs regarding this Dhamma and discipline, would thoroughly refute with reasoned argument the wanderers of other sects,
he would refute them in just such a way as the householder Vajjiyamāhita has done." [193]

# 95 (5) Uttiya

Then the wanderer Uttiya approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

(1) "How is it, Master Gotama, is the world eternal? Is this alone true and anything else wrong?"

"Uttiya, I have not declared: 'The world is eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong.'"

(2) "Then, Master Gotama, is the world not eternal? Is this alone true and anything else wrong?"

"Uttiya, I also have not declared: 'The world is not eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong.'"

(3)-(4) "How is it then, Master Gotama, is the world finite? . . . Is the world infinite? . . (5)-(6) Are the soul and the body the same? ...Is the soul one thing, the body another? ... (7)-(10) Does the Tathāgata exist after death? ... Does the Tathāgata not exist after death? . . Does the Tathāgata both exist and not exist after death? . . . Does the Tathāgata neither exist nor not exist after death? Is this alone true and anything else wrong?"

"Uttiya, I also have not declared: 'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death; this alone is true, anything else is wrong."'2127

"When I asked you: 'How is it, Master Gotama, is the world eternal? Is this alone true and anything else wrong?' you said: 'Uttiya, I have not declared: "The world is eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong."' But when I asked you: 'Then, Master Gotama, is the world not eternal? Is this alone true and anything else wrong?' you said: 'Uttiya, I also have not declared: "The world is not eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong."' When I asked you: 'How is it then, Master Gotama, is the world finite? . . Does the Tathāgata neither exist nor not exist after death? Is this alone true and anything else wrong?' [194] you said: 'Uttiya, I also have not declared: "The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death; this alone is true, anything else is wrong."' What, then, has Master Gotama declared?"

"Through direct knowledge, Uttiya, I teach the Dhamma to
my disciples for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and dejection, for the achievement of the method, for the realization of nibbāna."

"But when Master Gotama, through direct knowledge, teaches the Dhamma to his disciples for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and dejection, for the achievement of the method, for the realization of nibbāna, will the entire world be thereby emancipated, or half the world, or a third of the world?"

When this was asked, the Blessed One remained silent. Then it occurred to the Venerable Ānanda: "The wanderer Uttiya had better not adopt the evil view: 'When I ask the ascetic Gotama the most elevated question of all, he falters and does not answer. [^2128] It must be that he is unable to do so.' This would lead to the wanderer Uttiya's harm and suffering for a long time."

Then the Venerable Ananda said to the wanderer Uttiya: "Well then, friend Uttiya, I will give you a simile. Some intelligent people here understand the meaning of what is said by means of a simile. Suppose a king had a frontier city with strong ramparts, walls, and arches, and with a single gate. The gatekeeper posted there would be wise, competent, and intelligent; one who keeps out strangers [195] and admits acquaintances. While he is walking along the path that encircles the city he would not see a cleft or an opening in the walls even big enough for a cat to slip through. He might not know how many living beings enter or leave the city, but he could be sure that whatever large living beings enter or leave the city all enter and leave through that gate. So too, friend Uttiya, the Tathāgata has no concern whether the entire world will be emancipated, or half the world, or a third of the world. But he can be sure that all those who have been emancipated, or who are being emancipated, or who will be emancipated from the world first abandon the five hindrances, corruptions of the mind that weaken wisdom, and then, with their minds well established in the four establishments of mindfulness, develop correctly the seven factors of enlightenment. It is in this way that they have been emancipated or are being emancipated or will be emancipated from the world.

"Friend Uttiya, you asked the Blessed One from a different
angle the same question that you had already asked him. [^2129] Therefore the Blessed One did not answer you." [196]

96 (6) Kokanada [^2130]

On one occasion the Venerable Ānanda was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Park. Then, as the night was receding, the Venerable Ānanda rose and went to the hot springs to bathe. Having bathed in the hot springs and come back out, he stood in one robe drying his limbs. The wanderer Kokanada, too, rose as the night was receding and went to the hot springs to bathe. He saw the Venerable Ananda from a distance and said to him:

"Who is here, friend?"

"I am a bhikkhu, friend."

"From which group of bhikkhus, friend?"

"From the ascetics following the Sakyan son."

"If you could take the time to answer my question, I would like to ask you about a certain point."

"You may ask, friend. When I hear your question, I'll know [whether I can answer it]."

"How is it, sir, do you hold the view: (1) 'The world is eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong'?"

"I don't hold such a view, friend."

"Then do you hold the view: (2) 'The world is not eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong'?"

"I don't hold such a view, friend."

"Do you hold the view: (3)-(4) 'The world is finite'... 'The world is infinite'...(5)-(6) 'The soul and the body are the same' ... 'The soul is one thing, the body another'...(7)-(10) 'The Tathāgata exists after death'...'The Tathāgata does not exist after death'...'The Tathāgata both exists and [197] does not exist after death'...'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death; this alone is true, anything else is wrong'?"

"I don't hold such a view, friend."

"Could it then be that you do not know and see?"

"It isn't the case, friend, that I do not know and see. I know and see."

"When I asked you: 'How is it, sir, do you hold the view: "The world is eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong"?' you said: 'I don't hold'such a view, friend.' But when I asked
you: 'Then do you hold the view: "The world is not eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong"?' you said: 'I don't hold such a view, friend.' When I asked you: 'Do you hold the view: "The world is finite" . . "The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death; this alone is true, anything else is wrong"?' you said: 'I don't hold such a view, friend.' Then when I asked you: 'Could it then be that you do not know and see?' you said: 'It isn't the case, friend, that I do not know and see. I know and see.' How, friend, should the meaning of this statement be understood?"

"'The world is eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong,' friend: this is a speculative view. 'The world is not eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong': this is a speculative view. 'The world is finite' . . 'The world is infinite' . . 'The soul and the body are the same' . . 'The soul is one thing, the body another' . . 'The Tathāgata exists after death' . . 'The Tathāgata does not exist after death' . . 'The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death' . . 'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death; this alone is true, [198] anything else is wrong': this is a speculative view.

"To the extent, friend, that there is a speculative view, a basis for views, [^2131] a foundation for views, obsession with views, the origination of views, and the uprooting of views, I know and see this. When I know and see this, why should I say: 'I do not know and see.' I know, friend, I see."

"What is your name? And how are you known by your fellow monks?"

"My name is Ānanda, and my fellow monks know me as Ānanda."

"Indeed, I did not realize that I was consulting the great teacher, the Venerable Ānanda! If I had realized that this was the Venerable Ānanda, I wouldn't have spoken so much. Let the Venerable Ānanda please pardon me."

# 97 (7) Worthy of Gifts

"Bhikkhus, possessing ten qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What ten?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the

Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them.

(2) "He has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and accumulates what he has learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning [199] and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life-such teachings as these he has learned much of, retained in mind, recited verbally, investigated mentally, and penetrated well by view.

(3) "He has good friends, good companions, good comrades.

(4) "He holds right view and has a correct perspective.

(5) "He wields the various kinds of psychic potency: having been one, he becomes many; having been many, he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he goes unhindered through a wall, through a rampart, through a mountain as though through space; he dives in and out of the earth as though it were water; he walks on water without sinking as though it were earth; seated cross-legged, he travels in space like a bird; with his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; he exercises mastery with the body as far as the brahmā world.

(6) "With the divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the human, he hears both kinds of sounds, the divine and human, those that are far as well as near.

(7) "He understands the minds of other beings and persons, having encompassed them with his own mind. He understands a mind with lust as a mind with lust, and a mind without lust as a mind without lust; a mind with hatred as a mind with hatred, and a mind without hatred as a mind without hatred; a mind with delusion as a mind, with delusion, and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion; a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted; an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted; a surpassable mind as surpassable and an unsurpassable mind as unsurpassable; a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated; a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated. [^2153]

(8) "He recollects his manifold past abodes, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, [200] five births, ten births,
twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many eons of world-dissolution, many eons of world-evolution, many eons of world-dissolution and world-evolution thus: 'There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere, and there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn here.' Thus he recollects his manifold past abodes with their aspects and details.

(9) "With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma thus: 'These beings who engaged in misconduct by body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong view, and undertook kamma based on wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; but these beings who engaged in good conduct by body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right view, and undertook kamma based on right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.' Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma.

(10) "With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. [201]

"Possessing these ten qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

# 98 (8) An Elder

"Bhikkhus, possessing ten qualities, an elder bhikkhu dwells at ease in whatever quarter he-lives: What ten? (1) An elder is
of long-standing, long gone forth. (2) He is virtuous. . . . Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. (3) He has learned much . . . and penetrated well by view. (4) Both Pätimokkhas have been well transmitted to him in detail, well analyzed, well mastered, well determined in terms of the rules and their detailed explication. (5) He is skilled in the origination and settlement of disciplinary issues. (6) He loves the Dhamma and is pleasing in his assertions, filled with a lofty joy pertaining to the Dhamma and discipline. (7) He is content with any kind of robe, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick. (8) He is graceful when going forward and returning, and also well restrained when sitting among the houses. (9) He gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life. (10) With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. Possessing these ten qualities, an elder bhikkhu dwells at ease in whatever quarter he lives."

# 99 (9) Upāli

Then the Venerable Upāli approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, [202] and said: "Bhante, I wish to resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves."

"Remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves are hard to endure, Upāli. Solitude is hard to undertake and hard to delight in. When he is alone, the woods steal the mind of a bhikkhu who does not gain concentration. It can be expected that one who says 'I do not gain concentration, yet I will resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves' will either sink or float away. [^2133]

"Suppose, Upāli, there was a large lake, and a bull elephant seven or eight cubits in size would come along. He might think: 'Let me enter this lake and playfully wash my ears and back. I will bathe and drink, come out, and set off wherever I want.' He then enters the lake and playfully washes his ears and back. He bathes and drinks, comes out, and sets off wherever he wants. How so? Because his large body finds a footing in the depths.

"Then a hare or a cat comes along. It might think: 'How is a
bull elephant different from myself? I'll enter this lake and playfully wash my ears and back. [203] I will bathe and drink, come out, and set off wherever I want.' Then, without reflecting, it hastily enters the deep lake. It can be expected that it will either sink or float away. Why so? Because its small body does not find a footing in the depths. So too, it can be expected that one who would say: 'I do not gain concentration, yet I will resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves,' will either sink or float away.

"Suppose, Upāli, à young infant boy, lying on his back, would play with his own urine and feces. What do you think, isn't that a completely foolish type of amusement?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"Sometime later, when that boy grows up and his faculties mature, he would play the games that are typical for boysgames with toy plows, stick games, somersaults, games with pinwheels, games with measures made of leaves, games with toy chariots, games with toy bows. What do you think, isn't this amusement more excellent and sublime than the former kind?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"At a still later time, as that boy continues to grow up and his faculties mature still more, he enjoys himself furnished and endowed with the five objects of sensual pleasure: with forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensual pleasure, tantalizing; with sounds cognizable by the ear . . . with odors cognizable by the nose . . . with tastes cognizable by the tongue . . . with tactile objects cognizable by the body [204] that are wished for, desired, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensual pleasure, tantalizing. What do you think, isn't this amusement more excellent and sublime than the former kind?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"Here, Upāli, the Tathāgata arises in the world, [^2134] an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One. Having realized with his own direct knowledge this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, with
its devas and humans, he makes it known to others. He teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; he reveals the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life.

"A householder or householder's son or one born in some other clan hears this Dhamma. He then acquires faith in the Tathāgata and considers thus: 'Household life is crowded and dusty; life gone forth is wide open. It is not easy, while living at home, to lead the spiritual life that is utterly perfect and pure as a polished conch shell. Suppose I shave off my hair and beard, put on ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness.' On a later occasion, having abandoned a small or a large fortune, having abandoned a small or a large circle of relatives, he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness:

"Having thus gone forth and possessing the bhikkhus' training and way of life, having abandoned the destruction of life, he abstains from the destruction of life; with the rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious and kindly, he dwells compassionate toward all living beings. Having abandoned taking what is not given, he abstains from taking what is not given; he takes only what is given, expects only what is given, and dwells honestly without thoughts of theft. Having abandoned sexual activity, he observes celibacy, [205] living apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the common person's practice.

"Having abandoned false speech, he abstains from false speech; he speaks truth, adheres to truth; he is trustworthy and reliable, no deceiver of the world. Having abandoned divisive speech, he abstains from divisive speech; he does not repeat elsewhere what he has heard here in order to divide [those people] from these, nor does he repeat to these what he has heard elsewhere in order to divide [these people] from those; thus he is one who reunites those who are divided, a promoter of unity, who enjoys concord, rejoices in concord, delights in concord, a speaker of words that promote concord. Having abandoned harsh speech, he abstains from harsh speech; he speaks words that are gentle, pleasing to the ear, lovable, words that go to the heart, courteous words that are desired by many people and agreeable to many people. Having abandoned idle chatter, he abstains from idle chatter; he speaks at a proper time,
speaks what is fact, speaks on what is beneficial, speaks on the Dhamma and the discipline; at the proper time he speaks words that are worth recording, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.

"He abstains from injuring seeds and plants. He eats once a day, abstaining from eating at night and outside the proper time. He abstains from dancing, singing, instrumental music, and unsuitable shows. He abstains from adorning and beautifying himself by wearing garlands and applying scents and unguents. He abstains from high and large beds. He abstains from accepting gold and silver, raw grain, raw meat, women and girls, men and women slaves, goats and sheep, fowl and pigs, elephants, cattle, horses, and mares, fields and land. He abstains from going on errands and running messages; from buying and selling; from cheating with weights, metals, and measures; [206] from accepting bribes, deceiving, defrauding, and trickery. He abstains from wounding, murdering, binding, brigandage, plunder, and violence.

"He is content with robes to protect his body and almsfood to maintain his stomach, and wherever he goes he sets out taking only these with him. Just as a bird, wherever it goes, flies with its wings as its only burden, so too, a bhikkhu is content with robes to protect his body and almsfood to maintain his stomach, and wherever he goes he sets out taking only these with him. Possessing this aggregate of noble virtuous behavior, he experiences blameless bliss within himself.

"Having seen a form with the eye, he does not grasp at its marks and features. Since, if he left the eye faculty unrestrained, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him, he practices restraint over it; he guards the eye faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. Having heard a sound with the ear ... Having smelled an odor with the nose ... Having tasted a taste with the tongue . . . Having felt a tactile object with the body... Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, he does not grasp at its marks and features. Since, if he left the mind faculty unrestrained, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him, he practices restraint over it; he guards the mind faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty. Possessing this noble restraint of the faculties, he experiences unsullied bliss within himself.

"He acts with clear comprehension when going forward
and returning; he acts with clear comprehension when looking ahead and looking away; he acts with clear comprehension when bending and stretching his limbs; he acts with clear comprehension when wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl; he acts with clear comprehension when eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting; he acts with clear comprehension when defecating and urinating; he acts with clear comprehension when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and keeping silent.

"Possessing this aggregate of noble virtuous behavior, and this [207] noble restraint of the faculties, and this noble mindfulness and clear comprehension, he resorts to a secluded lodging: the forest, the root of a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a jungle thicket, an open space, a heap of straw.

"Having gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree; or to an empty hut, he sits down, folding his legs crosswise, straightening his body, and establishing mindfulness in front of him. Having abandoned longing for the world, he dwells with a mind free from longing; he purifies his mind from longing. Having abandoned ill will and hatred, he dwells with a mind free from ill will, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings; he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred. Having abandoned dullness and drowsiness, he dwells free from dullness and drowsiness, percipient of light, mindful and clearly comprehending; he purifies his mind from dullness and drowsiness. Having abandoned restlessness and remorse, he dwells without agitation, with a mind inwardly peaceful; he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorse. Having abandoned doubt, he dwells having gone beyond doubt, unperplexed about wholesome qualities; he purifies his mind from doubt.

(1) "Having thus abandoned these five hindrances, defilements of the mind, qualities that weaken wisdom, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters upon and dwells in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. What do you think, isn't this dwelling more excellent and sublime than those that precede it?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"It is when they see this quality within themselves that my
disciples resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves. But they still haven't attained their own goal. [^2135]

(2) "Again, Upāli, with the subsiding of thought and examination, the bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna. . . . What do you think, isn't this dwelling more excellent and sublime than those that precede it?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"It is when they see this quality, too, within themselves [208] that my disciples resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves. But they still haven't attained their own goal.

(3) "Again, Upāli, with the fading away as well of rapture. . . he enters and dwells in the third jhāna. . . What do you think, isn't this dwelling more excellent and sublime than those that precede it?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"It is when they see this quality, too, within themselves that my disciples resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves. But they still haven't attained their own goal.

(4) "Again, Upāli, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain . . . he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna. . . What do you think, isn't this dwelling more excellent and sublime than those that precede it?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"It is when they see this quality, too, within themselves that my disciples resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves. But they still haven't attained their own goal.

(5) "Again, Upāli, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, [perceiving] 'space is infinite,' the bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of space. What do you think, isn't this dwelling more excellent and sublime than those that precede it?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"It is when they see this quality, too, within themselves that my disciples resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves. But they still haven't attained their own goal.

(6) "Again, Upāli, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of space, [perceiving] 'consciousness is infinite,' he enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of consciousness.

What do you think, isn't this dwelling more excellent and sublime than those that precede it?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"It is when they see this quality, too, within themselves that my disciples resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves. But they still haven't attained their own goal.

(7) "Again, Upāli, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of consciousness, [perceiving] 'there is nothing,' he enters and dwells in the base of nothingness. What do you think, Upāli, isn't this dwelling more excellent and sublime than those that precede it?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"It is when they see this quality, too, within themselves that my disciples resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves. But they still haven't attained their own goal.

(8) "Again, Upāli, by completely surmounting the base of nothingness, [perceiving] 'this is peaceful, this is sublime,' [209] he enters and dwells in the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception. What do you think, isn't this dwelling more excellent and sublime than those that precede it?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"It is when they see this quality, too, within themselves that my disciples resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves. But they still haven't attained their own goal.

(9) "Again, Upāli, by completely surmounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, he enters and dwells in the cessation of perception and feeling. (10) And having seen with wisdom, his taints are utterly destroyed. What do you think, isn't this dwelling more excellent and sublime than those that precede it?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"It is when they see this quality, too, within themselves that my disciples resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves. And they dwell having attained their own goal. [^2136]

"Come, Upāli, dwell within the Sangha. While you dwell within the Sangha you will be at ease. [^2137]

100 (10) Incapable

"Bhikkhus; without having abandoned these ten things, one is incapable of realizing arahantship. What ten? Lust, hatred,
delusion, anger, hostility, denigration, insolence, envy, miserliness, and conceit. Without having abandoned these ten things, one is incapable of realizing arahantship.

"Bhikkhus, having abandoned these ten things, one is capable of realizing arahantship. What ten? Lust ... conceit. Having abandoned these ten things, one is capable of realizing arahantship." [210]

# The Third Fifty

## I. An Ascetic's Perceptions

## 101 (1) An Ascetic's Perceptions

"Bhikkhus, when these three ascetic perceptions [^2138] are developed and cultivated, they fulfill seven things. What three?

(1) "I have entered upon a classless condition; (2) my living is dependent upon others; (3) my deportment should be different.' When these three perceptions of an ascetic are developed and cultivated, they fulfill seven things. What seven?

(4) "One consistently acts and behaves in accord with virtuous behavior. (5) One is without longing, (6) without ill will, (7) and without arrogance. (8) One is desirous of training. [211] (9) One uses the requisites for maintaining one's life with an awareness of their purpose. (10) One is energetic. When, bhikkhus, these three perceptions of an ascetic are developed and cultivated, they fulfill these seven things."

## 102 (2) Factors of Enlightenment

"Bhikkhus, when these seven factors of enlightenment are developed and cultivated, they fulfill the three true knowledges. What seven?

(1) "The enlightenment factor of mindfulness, (2) the enlightenment factor of discrimination of phenomena, (3) the enlightenment factor of energy, (4) the enlightenment factor of rapture, (5) the enlightenment factor of tranquility, (6) the enlightenment factor of concentration, and (7) the enlightenment factor of equanimity. When these seven factors of enlightenment are developed and cultivated, they fulfill the three true knowledges. What three?
(8) "Here, a bhikkhu recollects his manifold past abodes, tha is, one birth, two births... Thus he recollects his manifold pas abodes with their aspects and details. [^2139]

(9) "With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human ... he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma.

(10) "With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.

"When, bhikkhus, these seven factors of enlightenment are developed and cultivated, they fulfill these three true knowledges."

# 103 (3) The Wrong Course

"Bhikkhus, in dependence on the wrong course there is failure, not success. And how is it that in dependence on the wrong course there is failure, not success?

(1) "For one of wrong view, (2) wrong intention originates. For one of wrong intention, (3) wrong speech originates. For one of wrong speech, [212] (4) wrong action originates. For one of wrong action, (5) wrong livelihood originates. For one of wrong livelihood, (6) wrong effort originates. For one of wrong effort, (7) wrong mindfulness originates. For one of wrong mindfulness, (8) wrong concentration originates. For one of wrong concentration, (9) wrong knowledge originates. For one of wrong knowledge, (10) wrong liberation originates. [^2140] In this way, in dependence on the wrong course, there is failure, not success.

"In dependence on the right course, there is success, not failure. And how is it that in dependence on the right course, there is success, not failure?

(1) "For one of right view, (2) right intention originates. For one of right intention, (3) right speech originates. For one of right speech, (4) right action originates. For one of right action, (5) right livelihood originates. For one of right livelihood, (6) right effort originates. For one of right effort, (7) right mindfulness originates. For one of right mindfulness, (8) right concentration originates. For one of right concentration, (9) right knowledge originates. For one of right knowledge, (10) right liberation originates. [^2141] In this way, in dependence on the right course, there is success, not failure."

104 (4) A Seed [^2142]

"Bhikkhus, for a person of wrong view, wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, wrong concentration, wrong knowledge, and wrong liberation, whatever bodily kamma, verbal kamma, and mental kamma he instigates and undertakes in accordance with that view, and whatever his volition, yearning, inclination, and volitional activities, all lead to what is unwished for, undesired, and disagreeable, to harm and suffering. For what reason? Because the view is bad.

"Suppose, bhikkhus, a seed of neem, bitter cucumber, or bitter gourd were planted in moist soil. [213] Whatever nutrients it would take up from the soil and from the water would all lead to its bitter, pungent, and disagreeable flavor. For what reason? Because the seed is bad. So too, for a person of wrong view ... and wrong liberation, whatever bodily kamma, verbal kamma, and mental kamma he instigates and undertakes in accordance with that view, and whatever his volition, yearning, inclination, and volitional activities, all lead to what is unwished for, undesired, and disagreeable, to harm and suffering. For what reason? Because the view is bad.

"Bhikkhus, for a person of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration, right knowledge, and right liberation, whatever bodily kamma, verbal kamma, and mental kamma he instigates and undertakes in accordance with that view, and whatever his volition, yearning, inclination, and volitional activities, all lead to what is wished for, desired, and agreeable, to well-being and happiness. For what reason? Because the view is good.

"Suppose, bhikkhus, a seed of sugar cane, hill rice, or grape were planted in moist soil. Whatever nutrients it would take up from the soil and from the water would all lead to its agreeable, sweet, and delectable flavor. For what reason? Because the seed is good. So too, for a person of right view ...[214]... and right liberation, whatever bodily kamma, verbal kamma, and mental kamma he instigates and undertakes in accordance with that view, and whatever his volition, yearning, inclination, and volitional activities, all lead to what is wished for, desired, and agreeable, to well-being and happiness. For what reason? Because the view is good."

"Bhikkhus, there is a country in the south named Dhovana [^2146] ['Washing'], where there is food, drink, victuals, comestibles, refreshments, tonics, dancing, singing, and music. There is this 'Washing,' bhikkhus; that I do not deny. Yet this 'Washing' is low, common, for worldlings, ignoble, unbeneficial; it does not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to nibbāna:

"But I will teach, bhikkhus, a noble washing that leads exclusively to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to nibbāria.

## 111 (11) One Beyond Training (1)

Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:

"It is said, Bhante, 'one beyond training, one beyond training.' In what way, Bhante, is a bhikkhu one beyond training?"2147

"Here, bhikkhu, a bhikkhu possesses (1) the right view of one beyond training. He possesses (2) the right intention...(3) the

# 115 (3) Non-Dhamma (3)

"Bhikkhus, what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma should be understood, and what is harmful and what is beneficial should also be understood. Having understood what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma, and also what is harmful and what is beneficial, one should practice in accordance with the Dhamma and with what is beneficial." [225]

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One rose from his seat and entered his dwelling. [^2149] Then,
soon after the Blessed One had left, the bhikkhus considered: "Friends, the Blessed One taught this brief synopsis: 'Bhikkhus, what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma should be understood . . . one should practice in accordance with the Dhamma and with what is beneficial.' Then he rose from his seat and entered his dwelling without expounding its meaning in detail. Now who will expound its meaning in detail?" Then it occurred to them: "The Venerable Ānanda is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his wise fellow monks; he is capable of expounding the detailed meaning of this brief synopsis. Let us approach the Venerable Ānanda and ask him the meaning of this. We will retain it in mind as he explains it to us."

Then those bhikkhus approached the Venerable Ānanda and exchanged greetings with him, after which they sat down to one side and said: "Friend Ānanda, the Blessed One taught this brief synopsis. . . . Then he rose from his seat and entered his dwelling without expounding the meaning in detail. Soon after he left, we considered: 'Friends, the Blessed One [226] taught this brief synopsis....[all as above down to:] ...Let us approach the Venerable Ānanda and ask him the meaning of this. We will retain it in mind as he explains it to us.' Let the Venerable Ānanda expound it to us."

[The Venerable Ānanda replied:] "Friends, it is as though a man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood, would pass over the root and trunk of a great tree possessed of heartwood, thinking that heartwood should be sought among the branches and foliage. And so it is with you. When you were face to face with the Teacher you passed by the Blessed One, thinking to ask me about the meaning. For, friends, knowing, the Blessed One knows; seeing, he sees; he has become vision, he has become knowledge, he has become the Dhamma, he has become Brahmā; he is the expounder, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the giver of the deathless, the lord of the Dhamma, the Tathāgata. That was the time when you should have approached the Blessed One [227] and asked him about the meaning. You should have retained it in mind as he would have explained it to you."

"Surely, friend Ānanda, knowing, the Blessed One knows; seeing, he sees; he has become vision . . . the Tathāgata. That was the time when we should have approached the Blessed

One and asked him about the meaning, and we should have retained it in mind as he would have explained it to us. Yet the Venerable Ānanda is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his wise fellow monks. He is capable of expounding the detailed meaning of this synopsis. Let the Venerable Ānanda expound it without finding it troublesome."

"Then listen, friends, and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, friend," those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Ānanda said this:

"Friends, the Blessed One taught this brief synopsis without expounding the detailed meaning: 'Bhikkhus, what is nonDhamma and what is the Dhamma should be understood, and what is harmful and what is beneficial should also be understood. Having understood what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma, and also what is harmful and what is beneficial, one should practice in accordance with the Dhamma and with what is beneficial.' Now what, friends, is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma? And what is harmful and what is beneficial?

(1) "Wrong view, friends, is non-Dhamma; right view is the Dhamma. The numerous bad unwholesome qualities that originate with wrong view as condition: these are harmful. The numerous wholesome qualities that reach fulfillment by development with right view as condition: these are beneficial.

(2)-(9) "Wrong intention is non-Dhamma; right intention is the Dhamma...Wrong speech is non-Dhamma; right speech [228] is the Dhamma...Wrong action is non-Dhamma; right action is the Dhamma...Wrong livelihood is non-Dhamma; right livelihood is the Dhamma . .

(10) "Wrong liberation is non-Dhamma; right liberation is the Dhamma. The numerous bad unwholesome qualities that originate with wrong liberation as condition: these are harmful. The numerous wholesome qualities that reach fulfillment by development with right liberation as condition: these are beneficial.

"Friends, it is in this way that I understand the detailed mean-
ing of the Blessed One's brief synopsis. Now, if you wish, you may go to the Blessed One himself and ask him about the meaning of this. You should retain it in mind as the Blessed One explains it to you."

"Yes, friend," those bhikkhus replied, and having delighted and rejoiced in the Venerable Ānanda's statement, they rose from their seats and went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to him, they sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, the Blessed One taught this synopsis...[they here relate all that had taken place, adding:] [229]...Then, Bhante, we approached the Venerable Ānanda and asked him about the meaning. The Venerable Ā nanda expounded the meaning to us in these ways, in these terms and phrases."

"Good, good, bhikkhus! Ānanda is wise. Ānanda has great wisdom. If you had approached me and asked me the meaning of this, I would have explained it to you in the same way as Ananda: Such is the meaning of this, and so you should retain it in mind."

# 116 (4) Ajita [^2150]

Then the wanderer Ajita approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side [230] and said to the Blessed One:

"Master Gotama, I have a fellow ascetic named Pandita. [^2151] He has thought out five hundred arguments [^2152] by which those of other sects, when rebutted, know: 'We've been rebutted.'"

Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Do you remember, bhikkhus, Pandita's cases?"

"This is the time for it, Blessed One! This is the time for it, Fortunate One! Having heard this from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will retain in mind whatever the Blessed One says."

"Well then, bhikkhus, listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Here, someone refutes and disproves a doctrine contrary to the Dhamma with a doctrine contrary to the Dhamma. In this way, he delights an assembly contrary to the Dhamma. For this reason, the assembly contrary to the Dhamma becomes loud
and boisterous, exclaiming: 'He is truly wise, sir! He is truly wise, sir! [^2153]

"Someone refutes and disproves a doctrine that accords with the Dhamma by means of a doctrine contrary to the Dhamma. In this way, he delights an assembly contrary to the Dhamma. For this reason, the assembly contrary to the Dhamma becomes loud and boisterous, exclaiming: 'He is truly wise, sir! He is truly wise, sir!'

"Someone refutes and disproves both a doctrine that accords with the Dhamma and a doctrine contrary to the Dhamma by means of a doctrine contrary to the Dhamma. In this way, he delights an assembly contrary to the Dhamma. For this reason, the assembly contrary to the Dhamma becomes loud and boisterous, exclaiming: 'He is truly wise, sir! He is truly wise, sir! [^2154]

["Someone refutes and disproves both a doctrine that accords with the Dhamma and a doctrine contrary to the Dhamma by means of a doctrine that accords with the Dhamma.

"Bhikkhus, what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma should be understood, and what is harmful and what is beneficial should be understood. Having understood what is nonDhamma and what is the Dhamma, and what is harmful and what is beneficial, one should practice in accordance with the Dhamma and with what is beneficial....

[The sutta continues exactly as in 10:114, ending:]

"When it was said: 'Bhikkhus, what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma should be understood, and what is harmful and what is beneficial should be understood. Having understood what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma, [232] and what is harmful and what is beneficial, one should practice in
accordance with the Dhamma and with what is beneficial,' it is with reference to this that this was said."

# 117 (5) Sangärava

Then the brahmin Sangārava approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

"Master Gotama, what is the near shore? What is the far shore?"

"Brahmin, (1) wrong view is the near shore, right view the far shore. (2) Wrong intention is the near shore, right intention the far shore. (3) Wrong speech is the near shore, right speech the far shore. (4) Wrong action is the near shore, right action the far shore. (5) Wrong livelihood is the near shore, right livelihood the far shore. (6) Wrong effort is the near shore, right effort the far shore. (7) Wrong mindfulness is the near shore, right mindfulness the far shore. (8) Wrong concentration is the near shore, right concentration the far shore. (9) Wrong knowledge is the near shore, right knowledge the far shore. (10) Wrong liberation is the near shore, right liberation the far shore. The one, brahmin, is the near shore, the other the far shore."

Few are those people [^2156]

who go beyond.

The rest merely run

along the [near] shore.

When the Dhamma is rightly expounded those people who practice accordingly are the ones who will go beyond the realm of Death so hard to cross.

Having left the dark qualities behind, a wise person should develop the bright ones. Having come from home into homelessness, where it is hard to take delight-

There in seclusion one should seek delight, having left behind sensual pleasures.

Owning nothing, the wise person should cleanse himself of mental defilements. [233]

Those whose minds are rightly well developed in the enlightenment factors, who through non-clinging find delight in the relinquishment of grasping:

luminous, with taints destroyed, they are the quenched ones in the world. [^2157]

# 118 (6) Near

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you the near shore and the far shore: Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"What, bhikkhus, is the near shore, and what is the far shore? (1) Wrong view, bhikkhus, is the near shore, right view the far shore ... (10) Wrong liberation is the near shore, right liberation the far shore. The one, bhikkhus, is the near shore, the other the far shore."

[The verses attached are identical with those of the preceding sutta.]

## 119 (7) Paccorohanī (1)

Now on that occasion, on the uposatha day, the brahmin Jāṇussonī stood to one side not far from the Blessed One, with his head washed, wearing a new pair of linen clothes, holding a handful of wet [234] kusa grass. The Blessed One saw him standing there and said to him:

"Why is it, brahmin, that on the uposatha day you stand to one side with your head washed, wearing a new pair of linen clothes, holding a handful of wet kusa grass? What is happening today with the brahmin clan?"

"Today, Master Gotama, is the brahmin clan's paccorohani festival. [^2158]

"But how do the brahmins observe the paccorohani festival?"

"Here, Master Gotama, on the uposatha day, the brahmins wash their heads and put on a pair of new linen clothes. They then smear the ground with wet cow dung, cover this with green kusa grass, and lie down between the boundary and the
fire house. In the course of the night, they get up three times, and with reverential salutation pay homage to the fire: 'We descend in honor of the revered one. We descend in honor of the revered one. [^2159] They offer abundant ghee, oil, and butter to the fire. When the night has passed, they offer excellent food of various kinds to brahmins. It is in this way, Master Gotama, that the brahmins observe the paccorohanī festival."

"The paccorohanī festival in the Noble One's discipline, brahmin, is quite different from the paccorohanī festival of the brahmins."

"But how, Master Gotama, is the paccorohanī festival observed in the Noble One's discipline? It would be good if Master Gotama would teach me the Dhamma by explaining how the paccorohanī festival is observed in the Noble One's discipline."

"Well then, brahmin, listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, sir," the brahmin Jānussonī replied. The Blessed One said this: [235]

(1) "Here, brahmin, the noble disciple reflects thus: 'The result of wrong view is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong view; he descends from wrong view.

(2) "... The result of wrong intention is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong intention; he descends from wrong intention.

(3) "... The result of wrong speech is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong speech; he descends from wrong speech.

(4) "... The result of wrong action is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong action; he descends from wrong action.

(5) "... The result of wrong livelihood is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong livelihood; he descends from wrong livelihood.

(6) "... The result of wrong effort is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong effort; he descends from wrong effort.

(7) "... The result of wrong mindfulness is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong mindfulness; he descends from wrong mindfulness.
(8) "... The result of wrong concentration is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong concentration; he descends from wrong concentration.

(9) "... The result of wrong knowledge is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong knowledge; he descends from wrong knowledge.

(10) "... The result of wrong liberation is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong liberation; he descends from wrong liberation.

"It is in this way, brahmin, that the paccorohanī festival is observed in the Noble One's discipline."

"The puccorohanī festival in the Noble One's discipline, Master Gotama, is quite different from the paccorohanī festival of the brahmins. And the paccorohan festival of the brahmins is not worth a sixteenth part of the paccorohan festival in the Noble One's discipline. [236]

"Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the darkness so those with good eyesight can see forms. I now go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

# 120 (8) Paccorohanī (2)

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you the noble paccorohanī festival. Listen....

"And what, bhikkhus, is the noble paccorohanī festival? (1) Here, the noble disciple reflects thus: 'The result of wrong view is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong view; he descends from wrong view. (2) 'The result of wrong intention...(3) ... wrong speech... (4) ... wrong action... (5) ... wrong livelihood ...

# 121 (9) Forerunner

"Bhikkhus, just as the dawn is the forerunner and precursor of the sunrise, so right view is the forerunner and precursor of wholesome qualities. For one of right view, right intention originates.

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you what is good and what is bad. Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"And what, bhikkhus, is bad? Wrong view, wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, wrong concentration, wrong knowledge, and wrong liberation. This is called bad.

"And what, bhikkhus, is good? [241] Right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration, right knowledge, and right liberation. This is called good."

## II. JANUSSONI

167 (1) Paccorohanī (1) [^2162]

Now on that occasion, on the uposatha day, the brahmin Jāṇussonī stood to one side not far from the Blessed One, with
his head washed, wearing a new pair of linen clothes, holding a handful of wet kusa grass. The Blessed One saw him standing there and said to him:

"Why is it, brahmin, that on the uposatha day you stand to one side with your head washed, wearing a new pair of linen clothes, holding a handful of wet kusa grass? What is happening today with the brahmin clan?"

"Today, Master Gotama, is the brahmin clan's paccorohanī festival." [250]

"But how, brahmin, do the brahmins observe the paccorohanī festival?"

"Here, Master Gotama, on the uposatha day, the brahmins wash their heads and put on a pair of new linen clothes. They then smear the ground with wet cow dung, cover this with green kusa grass, and lie down between the boundary and the fire house. In the course of the night, they get up three times, and with reverential salutation pay homage to the fire: 'We descend in honor of the revered one. We descend in honor of the revered one.' They offer abundant ghee, oil, and butter to the fire. When the night has passed, they offer excellent food of various kinds to brahmins. It is in this way, Master Gotama, that the brahmins observe the paccorohanī festival."

"The paccorohanī festival in the Noble One's discipline, brahmin, is quite different from the paccorohanī festival of the brahmins."

"But how, Master Gotama, is the paccorohanī festival observed in the Noble One's discipline? It would be good if Master Gotama would teach me the Dhamma by explaining how the paccorohanī festival is observed in the Noble One's discipline."

"Well then, brahmin, listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, sir," the brahmin Jānussonī replied. The Blessed One said this:

(1) "Here, brahmin, the noble disciple reflects thus: 'The result of the destruction of life is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons the destruction of life; he descends from the destruction of life.

(2) "... The result of taking what is not given is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons taking what is not given; he descends from taking what is not given.
(3) ". . .' The result of sexual misconduct is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons sexual misconduct; he descends from sexual misconduct.

(4) ". . . The result of false speech is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' [251] Having reflected thus, he abandons false speech; he descends from false speech.

(5) ". . . The result of divisive speech is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons divisive speech; he descends from divisive speech.

(6) "... The result of harsh speech is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons harsh speech; he descends from harsh speech.

(7) "... The result of idle chatter is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons idle chatter; he descends from idle chatter.

(8) "... The result of longing is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons longing; he descends from longing.

(9) "... The result of ill will is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons ill will; he descends from ill will.

(10) "... The result of wrong view is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong view; he descends from wrong view.

"It is in this way, brahmin, that the paccorohanī festival is observed in the Noble One's discipline.".

"The paccorohanī festival in the Noble One's discipline, Master Gotama, is quite different from the paccorohanī festival of the brahmins. And the paccorohanī festival of the brahmins is not worth a sixteenth part of the paccorohanī festival in the Noble One's discipline.

"Excellent, Master Gotama! . . [as in 10:119] . . . Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

# 168 (2) Paccorohanī (2)

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you the noble paccorohanī festival. Listen. . .

"And what, bhikkhus, is the noble paccorohanī festival? [252] (1) Here, the noble disciple reflects thus: 'The result of the destruction of life is bad both in this present life and in future
lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons the destruction of life; he descends from the destruction of life. (2) 'The result of taking what is not given . . (3) . . sexual misconduct . . (4) . . . false speech... (5) ...divisive speech ...(6) ... harsh speech ... (7) ...idle chatter... (8) ...longing ... (9) ...ill will ... (10) ... wrong view is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong view; he descends from wrong view. This is called the noble paccorohanī festival."

169 (3) Sangärava [^2163].

Then the brahmin Sangārava approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

"Master Gotama, what is the near shore? What is the far shore?"

"Brahmin, (1) the destruction of life is the near shore, abstention from the destruction of life the far shore. (2) Taking what is not given is the near shore, abstention from taking what is not given the far shore. (3) Sexual misconduct is the near shore, abstention from sexual misconduct the far shore. (4) False speech is the near shore, abstention from false speech the far shore. (5) Divisive speech is the near shore, abstention from divisive speech the far shore. (6) Harsh speech is the near shore, abstention from harsh speech the far shore. (7) Idle chatter is the near shore, abstention from idle chatter the far shore. (8) Longing is the near shore, non-longing the far shore. (9) Ill will is the near shore, good will the far shore. (10) Wrong view is the near shore, right view the far shore. The one, brahmin, is the near shore, the other the far shore." [253]

Few are those people who go beyond.

The rest merely run along the [near] shore.

When the Dhamma is rightly expounded those people who practice accordingly are the ones who will go beyond the realm of Death so hard to cross.

Having left the dark qualities behind, a wise person should develop the bright ones. Having come from home into homelessness, where it is hard to take delight-

There in seclusion one should seek delight, having left behind sensual pleasures. Owning nothing, the wise person should cleanse himself of mental defilements,

Those whose minds are rightly well developed in the enlightenment factors, who through non-clinging find delight in the relinquishment of grasping:

luminous, with taints destroyed, they are the quenched ones in the world.

170 (4) The Near Shore

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you the near shore and the far shore. Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"What, bhikkhus, is the near shore, and what is the far shore? (1) The destruction of life, bhikkhus, is the near shore, abstention from the destruction of life the far shore.... (10) Wrong view is the near shore, right view the far shore. The one, bhikkhus; is the near shore, the other the far shore." [254]

[The verses attached are identical with those of the preceding sutta.]

171 (5) Non-Dhamma (1) [^2164]

"Bhikkhus, what is non-Dhamma and harmful should be understood, and what is the Dhamma and beneficial should also be understood. Having understood what is non-Dhamma and harmful, and also what is the Dhamma and beneficial, one should practice in accordance with the Dhamma and with what is beneficial.

"And what, bhikkhus, is non-Dhamma and harmful? The destruction of life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech, divisive speech, harsh speech, idle chatter,
longing, ill will, and wrong view. This is what is said to be non-Dhamma and harmful.

"And what, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma and beneficial? Abstention from the destruction of life, abstention from taking what is not given, abstention from sexual misconduct, abstention from false speech, abstention from divisive speech, abstention from harsh speech, abstention from idle chatter, non-longing, good will, and right view. This is what is said to be the Dhamma and beneficial.

"When it was said: 'Bhikkhus, what is non-Dhamma and harmful should be understood, and what is the Dhamma and beneficial should also be understood. Having understood what is non-Dhamma and harmful, and also what is the Dhamma and beneficial, one should practice in accordance with the Dhamma and with what is beneficial,' it is with reference to this that this was said." [255]

# 172 (6) Non-Dhamma (2)

"Bhikkhus, what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma should be understood, and what is harmful and what is beneficial should also be understood. Having understood what is non-Dhammä and what is the Dhamma, and also what is harmful and what is beneficial, one should practice in accordance with the Dhamma and with what is beneficial."

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One rose from his seat and entered his dwelling. Then, soon after the Blessed One had left, the bhikkhus considered: "Friends, the Blessed One taught this brief synopsis: 'Bhikkhus, what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma should be understood . . . one should practice in accordance with the Dhamma and with what is beneficial.' Then he rose from his seat and entered his dwelling without expounding its meaning in detail. Now who will expound its meaning in detail?' Then it occurred to them: "The Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his wise fellow monks; he is capable of expounding the detailed meaning of this brief synopsis. Let us approach the Venerable Mahākaccāna and ask him the meaning of this. We will retain it in mind as he explains it to us."

Then those bhikkhus approached the Venerable Mahākaccāna
and exchanged greetings with him, after which they sat down to one side and said: "Friend Mahākaccāna, the Blessed One taught this brief synopsis....[256]...Then he rose from his seat and entered his dwelling without expounding the meaning in detail. Soon after he left, we considered: 'Friends, the Blessed One taught this brief synopsis. . . [all as above down to:] . . . Let us approach the Venerable Mahākaccāna and ask him the meaning of this. We will retain it in mind as he explains it to us.' Let the Venerable Mahākaccāna expound it to us."

[The Venerable Mahākaccāna replied:] "Friends, it is as though a man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood, would pass over the root and trunk of a great tree possessed of heartwood, thinking that heartwood should be sought among the branches and foliage. And so it is with you. When you were face to face with the Teacher you passed by the Blessed One, thinking to ask me about the meaning. For, friends, knowing, the Blessed One knows; seeing, he sees; he has become vision, he has become knowledge, he has become the Dhamma, he has become Brahmā; he is the expounder, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the giver of the deathless, the lord of the Dhamma, the Tathāgata. That was the time when you [257] should have approached the Blessed One and asked him about the meaning. You should have retained it in mind as he would have explained it to you."

"Surely, friend Kaccāna, knowing, the Blessed One knows; seeing, he sees; he has become vision ... the Tathāgata. That was the time when we should have approached the Blessed One and asked him about the meaning, and we should have retained it in mind as he would have explained it to us. Yet the Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his wise fellow monks. He is capable of expounding the detailed meaning of this synopsis. Let the Venerable Mahākaccāna expound it without finding it troublesome."

"Then listen, friends, and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, friend," those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Mahākaccāna said this:

"Friends, the Blessed One taught this brief synopsis without expounding the detailed meaning: 'Bhikkhus, what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma should be understood, and what is harmful and what is beneficial should also
be understood. Having understood what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma, and also what is harmful and what is beneficial, one should practice in accordance with the Dhamma and with what is beneficial.' Now what, friends, is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma? And what is harmful and what is beneficial?

(1) "The destruction of life, friends, is non-Dhamma; abstention from the destruction of life is the Dhamma: The numerous bad unwholesome qualities that originate with the destruction of life as condition: these are harmful. The numerous wholesome qualities that reach fulfillment by development with abstention from the destruction of life as condition: these are beneficial.

(2) "Taking what is not given is non-Dhamma; abstention from taking what is not given is the Dhamma.

The numerous wholesome qualities that reach fulfillment by development with abstention from idle chatter as condition: these are beneficial.

(8) "Longing is non-Dhamma; non-longing is the Dhamma. The numerous bad unwholesome qualities that originate with longing as condition: these are harmful. The numerous wholesome qualities that reach fulfillment by development with nonlonging as condition: these are beneficial.

(9) "Ill will is non-Dhamma; good will is the Dhamma. The numerous bad unwholesome qualities that originate with ill will as condition: these are harmful. The numerous wholesome qualities that reach fulfillment by development with good will as condition: these are beneficial.

(10) "Wrong view is non-Dhamma; right view is the Dhamma. The numerous bad unwholesome qualities that originate with wrong view as condition: these are harmful. The numerous wholesome qualities that reach fulfillment by development with right view as condition: these are beneficial.

"Friends, [259] it is in this way that I understand the detailed meaning of the Blessed One's brief synopsis. Now, if you wish, you may go to the Blessed One himself and ask him about the meaning of this. You should retain it in mind as the Blessed One explains it to you."

"Yes, friend," those bhikkhus replied, and having delighted and rejoiced in the Venerable Mahākaccāna's statement, they rose from their seats and went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to him, they sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, the Blessed One taught this synopsis.... [260] [they here relate all that had taken place, adding:] ... Then, Bhante, we approached the Venerable Mahākaccāna and asked him about the meaning. The Venerable Mahākaccāna expounded the meaning to us in these ways, in these terms and phrases."
"Good, good, bhikkhus! Mahākaccāna is wise. Mahākaccāna has great wisdom. If you had approached me and asked me the meaning of this, I would have explained it to you in the same way as Mahākaccāna. Such is the meaning of this, and so you should retain it in mind."

# 173 (7) Non-Dhamma (3)

"Bhikkhus, what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma should be understood, and what is harmful and what is beneficial should also be understood. Having understood what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma, and also what is harmful and what is beneficial, one should practice in accordance with the Dhamma and with what is beneficial:

"And what, bhikkhus, is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma? And what is harmful and what is beneficial?

(1) "The destruction of life is non-Dhamma; abstention from the destruction of life is the Dhamma. The numerous bad unwholesome qualities that originate with the destruction of life as condition: these are harmful.

# 174 (8) Causes of Kamma

"Bhikkhus, the destruction of life, I say, is threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Taking what is not given, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Sexual misconduct, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. False speech, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Divisive speech, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Harsh speech, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Idle chatter, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Longing, [262] I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Ill will, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Wrong view, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion.

"Thus, bhikkhus, greed is a source and origin of kamma; hatred is a source and origin of kamma; delusion is a source and origin of kamma. With the destruction of greed, a source of kamma is extinguished. With the destruction of hatred, a source of kamma is extinguished. With the destruction of delusion, a source of kamma is extinguished."

## 175 (9) Avoidance

"Bhikkhus, this Dhamma offers a means of avoidance. It does not lack a means of avoidance. And how does this Dhamma offer a means of avoidance and not lack a means of avoidance?

(1) "One who destroys life has abstention from the destruction of life as the means to avoid it. (2) One who takes what is not given has abstention from taking what is not given as the means to avoid it. (3) One who engages in sexual misconduct has abstention from sexual misconduct as the means to avoid it. (4) One who speaks falsely has abstention from false speech as the means to avoid it. (5) One who speaks divisively has
abstention from divisive speech as the means to avoid it. (6) One who speaks harshly has abstention from harsh speech as the means to avoid it. (7) One who indulges in idle chatter has abstention from idle chatter as the means to avoid it. (8) One full of longing has non-longing as the means to avoid it. (9) One full of ill will has good will as the means to avoid it. (10) One who holds wrong view has right view as the means to avoid it.

"It is in this way, bhikkhus, that this Dhamma offers a means of avoidance and does not lack a means of avoidance." [263]

# 176 (10) Cunda

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Pāvā in the mango grove of Cunda, the smith's son. [^2165] Then Cunda, the smith's son, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Cunda, whose rites of purity [^2166] do you prefer?"

"Bhante, I prefer the rites of purity prescribed by the brahmins of the west who carry around waterpots, wear garlands of water plants, tend the sacred fire, and immerse themselves in water."

"And how, Cunda, do the brahmins of the west prescribe their rites of purity?"

"Here, Bhante, the brahmins of the west enjoin a disciple thus: 'Come, good man, having gotten up early, you should stroke the ground from your bed. If you don't stroke the ground, you should stroke wet cow dung. If you don't stroke wet cow dung, you should stroke green grass. If you don't stroke green grass, you should tend the sacred fire. If you don't tend the sacred fire, you should pay homage to the sun with reverential salutation. If you don't pay homage to the sun with reverential salutation, you should immerse yourself in water three times including the evening.' It is in this way that the brahmins of the west prescribe their rites of purity. It is their rites of purity that I prefer."

"Cunda, purification in the Noble One's discipline is quite different from the rites of purity prescribed by the brahmins of the west who carry around waterpots, wear garlands of water plants, tend the sacred fire, and immerse themselves in water." [264]

"But how, Bhante, does purification come about in the Noble

One's discipline? It would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in a way that explains how purification comes about in the Noble One's discipline."

"Well then, Cunda, listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," Cunda, the smith's son, replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Impurity by body, Cunda, is threefold. Impurity by speech is fourfold. Impurity by mind is threefold.

"And how, Cunda, is impurity by body threefold?

(1) "Here, someone destroys life. He is murderous, bloodyhanded, given to blows and violence, merciless to living beings.

(2) "He takes what is not given. He steals the wealth and property of others in the village or forest.

(3) "He engages in sexual misconduct. He has sexual relations with women who are protected by their mother, father, mother and father, brother, sister, or relatives; who are protected by their Dhamma; who have a husband; whose violation entails a penalty; or even with one already engaged. [^2167]

"It is in this way that impurity by body is threefold.

"And how, Cunda, is impurity by speech fourfold?

(4) "Here, someone speaks falsehood. If he is summoned to a council, to an assembly, to his relatives' presence, to his guild, or to the court, and questioned as a witness thus: 'So, good man, tell what you know,' then, not knowing, he says, 'I know,' or knowing, he says, 'I do not know'; not seeing, he says, 'I see,' or seeing, he says, 'I do not see.' Thus [265] he consciously speaks falsehood for his own ends, or for another's ends, or for some trifling worldly end.

(5) "He speaks divisively. Having heard something here, he repeats it elsewhere in order to divide [those people] from these; or having heard something elsewhere, he repeats it to these people in order to divide [them] from those. Thus he is one who divides those who are united, a creator of divisions, one who enjoys factions, rejoices in factions, delights in factions, a speaker of words that create factions.

(6) "He speaks harshly. He utters such words as are rough, hard, hurtful to others, offensive to others, bordering on anger, unconducive to concentration.

(7) "He indulges in idle chatter. He speaks at an improper
time, speaks falsely, speaks what is unbeneficial, speaks contrary to the Dhamma and the discipline; at an improper time he speaks such words as are worthless, unreasonable, rambling, and unbeneficial.

"It is in this way that impurity by speech is fourfold.

"And how, Cunda, is impurity by mind threefold?

(8) "Here, someone is full of longing. He longs for the wealth and property of others thus: 'Oh, may what belongs to another be mine!'

(9) "He has a mind of ill will and intentions of hate thus: 'May these beings be slain, slaughtered, [^2168] cut off, destroyed, or annihilated!'

(10) "He holds wrong view and has an incorrect perspective thus: 'There is nothing given, nothing sacrificed, nothing offered; there is no fruit or result of good and bad actions; there is no this world, no other world; there is no mother, no father; there are no beings spontaneously reborn; there are in the world no ascetics and brahmins of right conduct and right practice who, having realized this world and the other world for themselves by direct knowledge, make them known to others.'

"It is in this way that impurity by mind is threefold. [266]

"These, Cunda, are the ten courses of unwholesome kamma. If one engages in these ten courses of unwholesome kamma, then, if one gets up early and strokes the ground from one's bed, one is impure, and if one doesn't stroke the ground, one is impure. If one strokes wet cow dung, one is impure, and if one doesn't stroke wet cow dung, one is impure. If one strokes green grass, one is impure, and if one doesn't stroke green grass, one is impure. If one tends the sacred fire, one is impure, and if one doesn't tend the sacred fire, one is impure. If one pays homage to the sun with reverential salutation, one is impure, and if one doesn't pay homage to the sun with reverential salutation, one is impure. If one immerses oneself in water three times including the evening, one is impure, and if one doesn't immerse oneself in water three times including the evening, one is impure. For what reason? Because these ten courses of unwholesome kamma are themselves impure and defiling. It is because people engage in these ten courses of unwholesome kamma that hell, the animal realm, the sphere of afflicted spirits, and other bad destinations are seen.
"Purity by body, Cunda, is threefold. Purity by speech is fourfold. Purity by mind is threefold.

"And how, Cunda, is purity by body threefold?

(1) "Here, someone, having abandoned the destruction of life, abstains from the destruction of life. With the rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious and kindly, he dwells compassionate toward all living beings.

(2) "Having abandoned the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what is not given. He does not steal the wealth and property of others in the village or in the forest.

(3) "Having abandoned sexual misconduct, he abstains from sexual misconduct. He does not have sexual relations with women who are protected by their mother, father, mother and father, brother, sister, or relatives; who are protected by their Dhamma; who have a husband; whose violation entails a penalty; [267] or even with one already engaged.

"It is in this way that purity by body is threefold.

"And how, Cunda, is purity by speech fourfold?

(4) "Here, someone, having abandoned false speech, abstains from false speech. If he is summoned to a council, to an assembly, to his relatives' presence, to his guild, or to the court, and questioned as a witness thus: 'So, good man, tell what you know,' then, not knowing, he says, 'I do not know,' or knowing, he says, 'I know'; not seeing, he says, 'I do not see,' or seeing, he says, 'I see.' Thus he does not consciously speak falsehood for his own ends, or for another's ends, or for some trifling worldly end.

(5) "Having abandoned divisive speech, he abstains from divisive speech. Having heard something here, he does not repeat it elsewhere in order to divide [those people] from these; or having heard something elsewhere, he does not repeat it to these people in order to divide [them] from'those. Thus he is one who reunites those who are divided, a promoter of unity, who enjoys concord, rejoices in concord, delights in concord, a speaker of words that promote concord.

(6) "Having abandoned harsh speech, he abstains from harsh speech. He speaks such words as are gentle, pleasing to the ear, and lovable, as go to the heart, are courteous, desired by many, and agreeable to many.

(7) "Having abandoned idle chatter, he abstains from idle
chatter. He speaks at a proper time, speaks truth, speaks what is beneficial, speaks on the Dhamma and the discipline; at a proper time he speaks such words as are worth recording, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.

"It is in this way that purity by speech is fourfold.

"And how, Cunda, is purity by mind threefold?

(8) "Here, someone is without longing. He does not long for the wealth and property of others thus: 'Oh, may what belongs to another be mine!'

(9) "He is of good will and his intentions are free of hate thus: 'May these beings live happily, free from enmity, affliction, and anxiety!'

(10) "He holds right view [268] and has a correct perspective thus: 'There is what is given, sacrificed, and offered; there is fruit and result of good and bad actions; there is this world and the other world; there is mother and father; there are beings. spontaneously reborn; there are in the world ascetics and brahmins of right conduct and right practice who, having realized this world and the other world for themselves by direct knowledge, make them known to others.'

"It is in this way that purity by mind is threefold."

"These, Cunda, are the ten courses of wholesome kamma. If one engages in these ten courses of wholesome kamma, then, if one gets up early and strokes the ground from one's bed, one is pure, and if one doesn't stroke the ground, one is pure. If one strokes wet cow dung, one is pure, and if one doesn't stroke wet cow dung, one is pure. If one strokes green grass, one is pure, and if one doesn't stroke green grass, one is pure. If one tends the sacred fire, one is pure, and if one doesn't tend the sacred fire, one is pure. If one pays homage to the sun with reverential salutation, one is pure, and if one doesn't pay homage to the sun with reverential salutation; one is pure. If one immerses oneself in water three times including the evening, one is pure, and if one doesn't immerse oneself in water three times including the evening, one is pure. For what reason? Because these ten courses of wholesome kamma are themselves pure and purifying. It is because people engage in these ten courses of wholesome kamma that the devas, human beings, and other good destinations are seen."

When this was said, Cunda, the smith's son, said to the Blessed One: "Excellent, Bhante! . . . Let the Blessed One accept
me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life." [269]

# 177 (11) Jannussonī

Then the brahmin Jāṇussonī approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

"Master Gotama, we brahmins give gifts and perform the memorial rites for the dead [^2169] with the thought: 'Let our gift be of benefit to our departed relatives and family members. Let our departed relatives and family members partake of our gift.' Can our gift, Master Gotama, actually be of benefit to our departed relatives and family members? Can our departed relatives and family members actually partake of our gift?"

"On a right occasion, brahmin, it can be of benefit, not on a wrong occasion."

"But, Master Gotama, what is a right occasion and what is a wrong occasion?"

"Here, brahmin, someone destroys life, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, speaks falsehood, speaks divisively, 'speaks harshly, indulges in idle chatter; he is full of longing, has a mind of ill will, and holds wrong view. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in hell. [^2170] He sustains himself and subsists there on the food of the hell-beings. This is a wrong occasion, when the gift is not of benefit to one living there.

"Someone else destroys life . . . and holds wrong view. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the animal realm. He sustains himself and subsists there on the food of animals. This, too, is a wrong occasion, when the gift is not of benefit to one living there.

"Still another abstains from the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, from divisive [270] speech, from harsh speech, from idle chatter; he is without longing, of good will, and holds right view. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with human beings. He sustains himself and subsists there on the food of human beings. This, too, is a wrong occasion, when the gift is not of benefit to one living there.

"Still another abstains from the destruction of life . . . and
holds right view. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with the devas. He sustains himself and subsists there on the food of devas. This, too, is a wrong occasion, when the gift is not of benefit to one living there.

"Still another destroys life . . . and holds wrong view. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the sphere of afflicted spirits. He sustains himself and subsists there on the food of afflicted spirits, or else he sustains himself there on what his friends, companions, relatives, or family members in this world offer to him. This is a right occasion, when the gift is of benefit to one living there."

"But, Master Gotama, who partakes of the gift if that deceased relative or family member has not been reborn in that place?"

"Other departed relatives or family members who have been reborn [^2171] in that place partake of the gift."

"But, Master Gotama, who partakes of the gift if neither that deceased relative or family member nor any others have been reborn in that place?"

"Over this long stretch of time [in samsāra], brahmin, it is impossible and inconceivable for that place to be devoid of [271] one's departed relatives and family members. Further, for the donor too it is not fruitless."

"Does Master Gotama posit [the value of giving] even on the wrong occasion?"2172

"Brahmin, I posit [the value of giving] even on the wrong occasion.

"Here, brahmin, someone destroys life, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, speaks falsehood, speaks divisively, speaks harshly, indulges in idle chatter; he is full of longing, has a mind of ill will, and holds wrong view. He gives an ascetic or a brahmin food and drink; clothing and a vehicle; garlands, scents, and unguents; bedding, dwellings, and lighting. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with elephants. There he gains food and drink, garlands and various ornaments.

"Since he here destroyed life ... and held wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with elephants. But since he gave an ascetic or a brahmin food and drink ... he there gains food and drink, garlands and various ornaments.
"Someone else destroys life . . . and holds wrong view. He gives an ascetic or a brahmin food and drink . . . and lighting. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with horses . . . cattle . . . dogs. There he gains food and drink, garlands and various ornaments.

"Since he here destroyed life . . . [272] . . . and held wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with horses . . . cattle . . . dogs. But since he gave an ascetic or a brahmin food and drink . . . he there gains food and drink, garlands and various ornaments.

"Still another abstains from the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, from divisive speech, from harsh speech, from idle chatter; he is without longing, of good will, and holds right view. He gives an ascetic or a brahmin food and drink; clothing and a vehicle; garlands, scents; and unguients; bedding, dwellings, and lighting. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with human beings. There he gains the five objects of human sensual pleasure.

"Since he here abstained from the destruction of life . . . and held right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with human beings. And since he gave an ascetic or a brahmin food and drink . . . he there gains the five objects of human sensual pleasure.

"Still another abstains from the destruction of life . . . and holds right view. He gives an ascetic or a brahmin food and drink ... and lighting. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with the devas. There [273] he gains the five objects of celestial sensual pleasure.

"Since he here abstained from the destruction of life . . . and held right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with the devas. And since he gave an ascetic or a brahmin food and drink . . . he there gains the five objects of celestial sensual pleasure. [That is why I said:] 'Further, for the donor too it is not fruitless."

"It's astounding and amazing, Master Gotama, that there is reason to give gifts and perform the memorial rites for the dead, since for the donor too it is not fruitless."

"So it is, brahmin! So it is, brahmin! For the donor too it is not fruitless."
"Excellent, Master Gotama! . . . Let Master Gotama accept me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

# III. GOOD [^2173]

178 (1) Good

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you what is good and what is bad. Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, [274] Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"And what, bhikkhus, is bad? The destruction of life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech, divisive speech, harsh speech, idle chatter, longing, ill will, and wrong view. This is called bad.

"And what, bhikkhus, is good? Abstention from the destruction of life, abstention from taking what is not given, abstention from sexual misconduct, abstention from false speech, abstention from divisive speech, abstention from harsh speech, abstention from idle chatter, non-longing, good will, and right view.

## V. Another Chapter on Persons [^2174]

199 (1) Associate With

"Bhikkhus, one should not associate with a person who possesses ten qualities. What ten? He destroys life, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, speaks falsehood, speaks divisively, speaks harshly, indulges in idle chatter; he is full of longing, has a mind of ill will, and holds wrong view. One should not associate with a person who possesses these ten qualities.

# An Extra Fifty

## I. The Deed-Born Body

211 (1) Hell (1)

"Bhikkhus, possessing ten qualities, one is deposited in hell as if brought there. What ten?

(1) "Here, someone destroys life; he is murderous, bloodyhanded, given to blows and violence, merciless to living beings.

(2) "He takes what is not given; he steals the wealth and property of others in the village or forest.

(3) "He engages in sexual misconduct; he has sexual relations
with women who are protected by their mother, father, mother and father, brother, sister, or relatives; who are protected by their Dhamma; who have a husband; whose violation entails a penalty; or even with one already engaged.

(9) "He has a mind of ill will and intentions of hate thus: 'May these beings be slain, slaughtered, cut off, destroyed, or annihilated!'

(10) "He holds wrong view and has an incorrect perspective thus: 'There is nothing given, nothing sacrificed, nothing offered; there is no fruit or result of good and bad actions; there is no this world, no other world; there is no mother, no father; there are no beings spontaneously reborn; there are in the world no ascetics and brahmins of right conduct and right practice who, having realized this world and the other world for themselves by direct knowledge, make them known to others.'

One possessing these ten qualities is deposited in heaven as if brought there."

# 216 (6) Creeping

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you an exposition of the Dhamma on creeping. [^2177] Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"And what, bhikkhus, is that exposition of the Dhamma on creeping? Bhikkhus, beings are the owners of their kamma, the heirs of their kamma; they have kamma as their origin, kamma as their relative, kamma as their resort; whatever kamma they do, good or bad, they are its heirs. [289]

(1) "Here, someone destroys life; he is murderous, bloody-. handed, given to blows and violence, merciless to living beings. He creeps along by body, speech, and mind. [^2178] His bodily kamma is crooked; his verbal kamma is crooked; his mental kamma is crooked. His destination is crooked; his rebirth is crooked. But for one with a crooked destination and rebirth, I say, there is one of two destinations: either the exclusively painful hells or a species of creeping animal. And what are the species of creeping animals? The snake, the scorpion, the centipede, the mongoose, the cat, the mouse, and the owl, [^2179] or any other animals that creep away when they see people. Thus a being is reborn from a being; one is reborn through one's deeds. When one has been reborn, contacts affect one. It is in this way, I say, that beings are the heirs of their kamma.

(2) "Someone takes what is not given ... (3) . . . engages in sexual misconduct . . (4) . . speaks falsehood . . (5) . . . speaks divisively . . (6) . . . speaks harshly . . (7) . . . indulges in idle chatter... (8) ... is full of longing ... (9) ... has a mind of ill will and intentions of hate ... (10) ... holds wrong view and has an incorrect perspective thus: 'There is nothing given ... there are in the world no ascetics and brahmins of right conduct and right practice who, having realized this world and the other
world for themselves by direct knowledge, make them known to others.' He creeps along by body, speech, and mind. His bodily kamma is crooked . . . His destination is crooked; [290] his rebirth is crooked. . . Thus a being is reborn from a being; one is reborn through one's deeds. When one has been reborn, contacts affect one. It is in this way, I say, that beings are the heirs of their kamma.

"Bhikkhus, beings are the owners of their kamma, the heirs of their kamma; they have kamma as their origin, kamma as their relative, kamma as their resort; whatever kamma they do, good or bad, they are its heirs.

(1) "Here, having abandoned the destruction of life, someone abstains from the destruction of life; with the rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious and kindly, he dwells compassionate toward all living beings. He does not creep along by body, speech, and mind. His bodily kamma is straight; his verbal kamma is straight; his mental kamma is straight. His destination is straight; his rebirth is straight. But for one with a straight destination and rebirth, I say, there is one of two destinations: either the exclusively pleasant heavens or eminent families, such as those of affluent khattiyas, affluent brahmins, or affluent householders, [families that are] rich, with great wealth and property, abundant gold and silver, abundant treasures and belongings, abundant wealth and grain. Thus a being is reborn from a being; one is reborn through one's deeds. When one has been reborn, contacts affect one. It is in this way, I say, that beings are the heirs of their kamma.

(2) "Having abandoned the taking of what is not given, someone abstains from taking what is not given...(3)...abstains from sexual misconduct . . . [291] (4) . . . abstains from false speech . . . (5) ...abstains from divisive speech ...(6)...abstains from harsh speech ...(7) . . . abstains from idle chatter . . (8) . . . is without longing ... (9) . . . is of good will ... (10) ... holds right view and has a correct perspective thus: 'There is what is given ... there are in the world ascetics and brahmins of right conduct and right practice who, having realized this world and the other world for themselves by direct knowledge, make them known to others.' He does not creep along by body, speech, and mind. His bodily kamma is straight . . . His destination is straight; his rebirth is straight. . . . Thus a being is reborn from a being; one is reborn through one's deeds. When one has been reborn,
contacts affect one. It is in this way, I say, that beings are the heirs of their kamma.

"Bhikkhus, beings are the owners of their kamma, the heirs of their kamma; they have kamma as their origin, kamma as their relative, kamma as their resort; whatever kamma they do, good or bad, they are its heirs.

"This, bhikkhus, is that exposition of the Dhamma on creeping." [292]

# 217 (7) Volitional (1)

"Bhikkhus, I do not say that there is a termination of volitional kamma [^2180] that has been done and accumulated so long as one has not experienced [its results], and that may be in this very life, or in the [next] rebirth, or on some subsequent occasion. But I do not say that there is making an end of suffering so long as one has not experienced [the results of] volitional kamma that has been done and accumulated. [^2181]

"As to this, bhikkhus, there is a threefold corruption and failure of bodily kamma, [^2182] arisen from unwholesome volition, having a painful outcome and result; a fourfold corruption and failure of verbal kamma, arisen from unwholesome volition, having a painful outcome and result; and a threefold corruption and failure of mental kamma, arisen from unwholesome volition, having a painful outcome and result.

"And how, bhikkhus, is there a threefold corruption and failure of bodily kamma, arisen from unwholesome volition, having a painful outcome and result?

(1) "Here, someone destroys life. He is murderous, bloodyhanded, given to blows and violence, merciless to living beings.

(2) "He takes what is not given. He steals the wealth and property of others in the village or forest.

(3) "He engages in sexual misconduct. He has sexual relations with women who are protected by their mother, father, mother and father, brother, sister, or relatives; who are protected by their Dhamma; who have a husband; whose violation entails a penalty; or even with one already engaged.

"It is in this way that there is a threefold corruption and failure of bodily kamma, arisen from unwholesome volition, having a painful outcome and result.

"And how, bhikkhus, is there a fourfold corruption and
failure of verbal kamma, arisen from unwholesome volition, having a painful outcome and result? [293]

(4) "Here, someone speaks falsehood. If he is summoned to a council, to an assembly, to his relatives' presence, to his guild, or to the court, and questioned as a witness thus: 'So, good man, tell what you know,' then, not knowing, he says, 'I know,' or knowing, he says, 'I do not know'; not seeing, he says, 'I see,' or seeing, he says, 'I do not see.' Thus he consciously speaks falsehood for his own ends, or for another's ends, or for some trifling worldly end.

(5) "He speaks divisively. Having heard something here, he repeats it elsewhere in order to divide [those people] from these; or having heard something elsewhere, he repeats it to these people in order to divide [them] from those. Thus he is one who divides those who are united, a creator of divisions, one who enjoys factions, rejoices in factions, delights in factions; a speaker of words that create factions.

(6) "He speaks harshly. He utters such words as are rough, hard, hurtful to others, offensive to others, bordering on anger, unconducive to concentration.

(7) "He indulges in idle chatter. He speaks at an improper time, speaks falsely, speaks what is unbeneficial, speaks contrary to the Dhamma and the discipline; at an improper time he speaks such words as are worthless, unreasonable, rambling, and unbeneficial.

"It is in this way that there is a fourfold corruption and failure of verbal kamma, arisen from unwholesome volition, having a painful outcome and result.

"And how, bhikkhus, is there a threefold corruption and failure of mental kamma, arisen from unwholesome volition, having a painful outcome and result?

(8) "Here, someone is full of longing. He longs for the wealth and property of others thus: 'Oh, may what belongs to another be mine!'

(9) "He has a mind of ill will and intentions of hate thus: 'May these beings be slain, slaughtered, cut off, destroyed, or annihilated!"

(10) "He holds wrong view and has an incorrect perspective thus: 'There is nothing given, nothing sacrificed, nothing offered; there is no fruit or result of good and bad actions; there
: no this world, no other world; there is no mother, no father; rere are no beings spontaneously reborn; [294] there are in re world no ascetics and brahmins of right conduct and right ractice who, having realized this world and the other world sr themselves by direct knowledge, make them known to thers.'

"It is in this way that there is a threefold corruption and failre of mental kamma, arisen from unwholesome volition, havig a painful outcome and result.

"It is, bhikkhus, because of the threefold corruption and failre of bodily kamma, arisen from unwholesome volition, that rith the breakup of the body, after death, beings are reborn in re plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, 1 hell; or it is because of the fourfold corruption and failure of erbal kamma, arisen from unwholesome volition, that with re breakup of the body, after death, beings are reborn in the lane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in ell; or it is because of the threefold corruption and failure of iental kamma, arisen from unwholesome volition, that with re breakup of the body, after death, beings are reborn in the lane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in ell.

# 220 (10) Conduct Contrary to the Dhamma

Then a certain brahmin approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had exchanged greetings and cordial talk; he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

"Master Gotama, why is it that some beings here, with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell?"

"It is, brahmin, because of unrighteous conduct, conduct contrary to the Dhamma, that some beings here, with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.

"It is, brahmin, because of righteous conduct, conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, that some beings here, with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world."

"I do not understand in detail the meaning of Master Gotama's statement that he has spoken in brief. Please let Master Gotama teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might understand the meaning in detail."

"Well then, brahmin, listen and attend closely. I will speak."
"Yes, sir," that brahmin replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Brahmin, unrighteous conduct, conduct contrary to the Dhamma, is threefold by way of the body, fourfold by way of speech, and threefold by way of the mind.

"And how, brahmin, is unrighteous conduct, conduct contrary to the Dhamma, threefold by way of the body? . . [here and below, the explanations are as in 10:217]... It is in this way that unrighteous conduct, conduct contrary to the Dhamma, is threefold by way of the mind.
