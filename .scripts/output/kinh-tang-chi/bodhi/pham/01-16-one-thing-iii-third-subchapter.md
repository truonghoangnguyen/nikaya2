Who is that one person? It is one who holds wrong view and has an incorrect perspective. He draws many people away from the good Dhamma and establishes them in a bad Dhamma. This is that one person who arises in the world for the harm of many people, the unhappiness of many people, for the ruin, harm, and suffering of many people, of devas and human beings. [^173]

in the world for the harm, suffering, calamity, and disaster of many beings." [34]
