## I. Obsession of the Mind

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Vènerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, I do not see even one other form that so obsesses the mind [^17] of a man as the form of a woman. The form of a woman obsesses the mind of a man."
