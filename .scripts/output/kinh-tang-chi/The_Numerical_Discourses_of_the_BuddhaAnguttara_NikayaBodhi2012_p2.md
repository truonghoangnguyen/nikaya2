5 (5) Wealth in Brief

"Bhikkhus, there are these seven kinds of wealth. What seven? The wealth of faith, the wealth of virtuous behavior, the wealth of moral shame, the wealth of moral dread, the wealth of learning, the wealth of generosity, and the wealth of wisdom. [5] These are the seven kinds of wealth."

The wealth of faith, the wealth of virtuous behavior, the wealth of moral shame and moral dread, the wealth of learning and generosity, with wisdom, the seventh kind of wealth:

when one has these seven kinds of wealth, whether a woman or a man, they say that one is not poor, that one's life is not lived in vain.

Therefore an intelligent person, remembering the Buddhas' teaching, should be intent on faith and virtuous behawic confidence and vision of the Dhamma.

# 6 (6) Wealth in Detail

"Bhikkhus, there are these seven kinds of wealth. What seven? The wealth of faith, the wealth of virtuous behavior, the wealth of moral shame, the wealth of moral dread, the wealth of learning, the wealth of generosity, and the wealth of wisdom.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the wealth of faith? Here, a noble disciple is endowed with faith. He places faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant... the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' This is called the wealth of faith.

(2) "And what is the wealth of virtuous behavior? Here, a noble disciple abstains from the destruction of life, abstains from taking what is not given, abstains from sexual misconduct, abstains from false speech, abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. This is called the wealth of virtuous behavior.

(3) "And what is the wealth of moral shame? Here, a noble disciple has a sense of moral shame; he is ashamed of bodily, ver-
bal, and mental misconduct; he is ashamed of acquiring bad, unwholesome qualities. This is called the wealth of moral shame.

(4) "And what is the wealth of moral dread? Here, a noble disciple dreads wrongdoing; he dreads bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct; he dreads acquiring bad, unwholesome qualities. This is called the wealth of moral dread.

(5) "And what is the wealth of learning? [6] Here, a noble disciple has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and accumulates what he has learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life-such teachings as these he has learned much of, retained in mind, recited verbally, mentally investigated, and penetrated well by view. This is called the wealth of learning.

(6) "And what is the wealth of generosity? Here, a noble disciple dwells at home with a heart devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in relinquishment, one devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing. This is called the wealth of generosity.

(7) "And what is the wealth of wisdom? Here, a noble disciple is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. This is called the wealth of wisdom.

"These, bhikkhus, are the seven kinds of wealth."

[The verses are identical with those of 7:5.]

# 7 (7) Ugga

Then Ugga the king's chief minister approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:

"It's astounding and amazing, Bhante, how Migāra of Rohana is so rich, with such great wealth and property."

"But how [7] rich is Migāra of Rohana? How much wealth and property does he have?"

"He has a hundred thousand units of minted gold, ${ }^{1456}$ not to mention silver."

"There is that kind of wealth, Ugga; this I don't deny. But that kind of wealth can be taken away by fire, water, kings, thieves, and displeasing heirs. However, Ugga, these seven kinds of
wealth cannot be taken away by fire, water, kings, thieves, and displeasing heirs. What seven? The wealth of faith, the wealth of virtuous behavior, the wealth of moral shame, the wealth of moral dread, the wealth of learning, the wealth of generosity, and the wealth of wisdom. These seven kinds of wealth cannot be taken away by fire, water, kings, thieves, and displeasing heirs."

[The verses are identical with those of 7:5.]

# 8 (8) Fetters

"Bhikkhus, there are these seven fetters. ${ }^{1457}$ What seven? The fetter of compliance, ${ }^{1458}$ the fetter of aversion, the fetter of views, the fetter of doubt, the fetter of conceit, the fetter of lust for existence, and the fetter of ignorance. These are the seven fetters."

## 9 (9) Abandoning

"Bhikkhus, the spiritual life is lived to abandon and eradicate seven fetters. What seven? [8] The fetter of compliance, the fetter of aversion, the fetter of views, the fetter of doubt, the fetter of conceit, the fetter of lust for existence, and the fetter of ignorance. The spiritual life is lived to abandon and eradicate these seven fetters.

"When a bhikkhu has abandoned the fetter of compliance, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising; when he has abandoned the fetter of aversion... the fetter of views . . . the fetter of doubt . . . the fetter of conceit . . . the fetter of lust for existence . . . the fetter of ignorance, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising, he is then called a bhikkhu who has cut off craving, stripped off the fetter, and by completely breaking through conceit, has made an end of suffering."

## 10 (10) Miserliness

"Bhikkhus, there are these seven fetters. What seven? The fetter of compliance, the fetter of aversion, the fetter of views, the fetter of doubt, the fetter of conceit, the fetter of envy, and the fetter of miserliness. ${ }^{1459}$ These are the seven fetters." [9]

# II. Underlying Tendencies

11 (1) Underlying Tendencies (1)

"Bhikkhus, there are these seven underlying tendencies. What seven? The underlying tendency to sensual lust, the underlying tendency to aversion, the underlying tendency to views, the underlying tendency to doubt, the underlying tendency to conceit, the underlying tendency to lust for existence, and the underlying tendency to ignorance. These are the seven underlying tendencies."

## 12 (2) Underlying Tendencies (2)

"Bhikkhus, the spiritual life is lived to abandon and eradicate the seven underlying tendencies. What seven? The underlying tendency to sensual lust, the underlying tendency to aversion, the underlying tendency to views, the underlying tendency to doubt, the underlying tendency to conceit, the underlying tendency to lust for existence, and the underlying tendency to ignorance. The spiritual life is lived to abandon and eradicate these seven underlying tendencies.

"When a bhikkhu has abandoned the underlying tendency to sensual lust, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising; when he has abandoned the underlying tendency to aversion... the underlying tendency to views ... the underlying tendency to doubt . . . the underlying tendency to conceit . . . the underlying tendency to lust for existence ... the underlying tendency to ignorance, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising, he is then called a bhikkhu without underlying tendencies, ${ }^{1460}$ one who has cut off craving, stripped off the fetter, and by completely breaking through conceit, has made an end of suffering." [10]

## 13 (3) Families

"Bhikkhus, possessing seven factors, a family that has not yet been approached is not worth approaching, or one that has been approached is not worth sitting with. ${ }^{1461}$ What seven? (1) They do not rise up in an agreeable way. ${ }^{1462}$ (2) They do not pay homage in an agreeable way. (3) They do not offer a seat in an agreeable way. (4) They hide what they have from one. (5) Even
when they have much, they give little. (6) Even when they have excellent things, they give coarse things. (7) They give without respect, not respectfully. Possessing these seven factors, a family that has not yet been approached is not worth approaching, or one that has been approached is not worth sitting with.

"Bhikkhus, possessing seven factors, a family that has not yet been approached is worth approaching or one that has been approached is worth sitting with. What seven? (1) They rise up in an agreeable way. (2) They pay homage in an agreeable way. (3) They offer a seat in an agreeable way. (4) They do not hide what they have from one. (5) When they have much, they give much. (6) When they have excellent things; they give excellent things. (7) They give respectfully, not without respect. Possessing these seven factors, a family that has not yet been approached is worth approaching, or one that has been approached is worth sitting with."

# 14 (4) Persons

"Bhikkhus, these seven persons are worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What seven? The one liberated in both respects, the one liberated by wisdom, the body witness, the one attained to view, the one liberated by faith, the Dhamma follower, and the faith follower. [11] These seven persons are worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. ${ }^{1463}$

## 15 (5) Similar to Those in Water

"Bhikkhus, there are these seven kinds of persons found existing in the world similar to those in water. What seven? (1) Here, some person has gone under once and remains under. (2) Some person has risen up and then goes under. (3) Some person has risen up and stays there. (4) Some person has risen up, sees clearly, and looks around. (5) Some person has risen up and crosses over. (6) Some person has risen up and gained a firm foothold. (7) Some person has risen up, crossed over, and gone beyond, a brahmin who stands on high ground. ${ }^{1464}$

(1) "And how, bhikkhus, is a person one who has gone under once and remains under? Here, some person possesses exclu-
sively black, unwholesome qualities. In this way a person is one who has gone under once and remains under.

(2) "And how is a person one who has risen up and then goes under? Here, some person has risen up, [thinking]: 'Good is faith in [cultivating] wholesome qualities; good is a sense of moral shame in [cultivating] wholesome qualities; good is moral dread in [cultivating] wholesome qualities; good is energy in [cultivating] wholesome qualities; good is wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities.' However, his faith does not become stable or grow but rather diminishes. His sense of moral shame . . . moral dread . . . energy . . . wisdom does not become stable or grow but rather diminishes. In this way a person is one who has risen up and then goes under.

(3) "And how is a person one who has risen up and stays put? [12] Here, some person has risen up, [thinking]: 'Good is faith in [cultivating] wholesome qualities . . . good is wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities.' His faith neither diminishes nor grows; it just stays put. His sense of moral shame ... his moral dread... his energy ... his wisdom neither diminishes nor grows; it just stays put. In this way a person is one who has risen up and stays put.

(4) "And how is a person one who has risen up, sees clearly, and looks around? Here, some person has risen up, [thinking]: 'Good is faith in [cultivating] wholesome qualities . . . good is wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities.' With the utter destruction of three fetters, this person is a stream-enterer, no longer subject to [rebirth in] the lower world, fixed in destiny, heading for enlightenment. It is in this way that a person is one who has risen up, sees clearly, and looks around.

(5) "And how is a person one who has risen up and is crossing over? Here, some person has risen up, [thinking]: 'Good is faith in [cultivating] wholesome qualities . . . good is wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities.' With the utter destruction of three fetters and with the diminishing of greed, hatred, and delusion, this person is a once-returner who, after coming back to this world only one more time, will make an end of suffering. It is in this way that a person is one who has risen up and is crossing over.

(6) "And how is a person one who has risen up and attained a firm foothold? Here, some person has risen up, [thinking]:
'Good is faith in [cultivating] wholesome qualities... good is wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities.' With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, he is of spontaneous birth, due to attain final nibbāna there without returning from that world. It is in this way that a person is one who has risen up and gained a firm foothold.

(7) "And how is a person one who has risen up, crossed over, and gone beyond, a brahmin who stands on high ground? [13] Here, some person has risen up, [thinking]: 'Good is faith in [cultivating] wholesome qualities; good is a sense of moral shame in [cultivating] wholesome qualities; good is moral dread in [cultivating] wholesome qualities; good is energy in [cultivating] wholesome qualities; good is wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities.' With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. It is in this way that a person is one who has risen up, crossed over, and gone beyond, a brahmin who stands on high ground.

"These, bhikkhus, are the seven kinds of persons found existing in the world similar to those in water."

# 16 (6) Impermanence

"Bhikkhus, there are these seven kinds of persons who are worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What seven?

(1) "Here, bhikkhus, some person dwells contemplating impermanence in all conditioned phenomena, perceiving impermanence, experiencing impermanence, constantly, continuously, and uninterruptedly focusing on it with the mind, fathoming it with wisdom. With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. This is the first kind of person worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world.

(2) "Again, some person dwells contemplating impermanence in all conditioned phenomena, perceiving imperma-
nence, experiencing impermanence, constantly, continuously, and uninterruptedly focusing on it with the mind, fathoming it with wisdom. For him the exhaustion of the taints and the exhaustion of life occur simultaneously. ${ }^{1465}$ This is the second kind of person worthy of gifts....

(3) "Again, bhikkhus, some person dwells contemplating impermanence in all conditioned phenomena, perceiving impermanence, experiencing impermanence, constantly, continuously, and uninterruptedly focusing on it with the mind, fathoming it with wisdom. With [14] the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, he becomes an attainer of nibbāna in the interval. ${ }^{1466}$ This is the third kind of person worthy of gifts....

(4) "... With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, he becomes an attainer of nibbāna upon landing. ${ }^{1467}$ This is the fourth kind of person worthy of gifts....

(5) "... With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, he becomes an attainer of nibbāna without exertion. ${ }^{1468}$ This is the fifth kind of person worthy of gifts....

(6) "... With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, he becomes an attainer of nibbāna through exertion. This is the sixth kind of person worthy of gifts....

(7) "Again, bhikkhus, some person dwells contemplating impermanence in all conditioned phenomena, perceiving impermanence, experiencing impermanence, constantly, continuously, and uninterruptedly focusing on it with the mind, fathoming it with wisdom. With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, he becomes one bound upstream; heading toward the Akaniṭtha realm. ${ }^{1469}$ This is the seventh kind of person worthy of gifts....

"These, bhikkhus, are the seven kinds of persons who are worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation; an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

# 17 (7) Suffering

"Bhikkhus, there are these seven kinds of persons who are worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What seven?

(1) "Here, bhikkhus, some person dwells contemplating
suffering in all conditioned phenomena, perceiving suffering, experiencing suffering, constantly, continuously, and uninterruptedly focusing on it with the mind, fathoming it with wisdom. With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. This is the first kind of person worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

[The rest as in 7:16, but based on contemplating suffering in all conditioned phenomena.]

18 (8) Non-Self ${ }^{1470}$

"Bhikkhus, there are these seven kinds of persons who are worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What seven?

(1) "Here, bhikkhus, some person dwells contemplating non-self in all phenomena, ${ }^{1471}$ perceiving non-self, experiencing non-self, constantly, continuously, and uninterruptedly focusing on it with the mind, fathoming it with wisdom. With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. This is the first kind of person worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

[The rest as in 7:16, but based on contemplating non-self in all phenomena.]

"Here, bhikkhus, some person dwells contemplating the happiness in nibbāna, perceiving such happiness, experiencing such happiness, constantly, continuously, and uninterruptedly focusing on it with the mind, fathoming it with wisdom. With the desiruction of the taints, he has realized for himself
with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. This is the first kind of person worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

[The rest as in 7:16, but based on contemplating the happiness in nibbāna.] [15]

20 (10) Bases for [Being] "Ten-less"

"Bhikkhus, there are these seven bases for [being] 'ten-less. ${ }^{1472}$ What seven?

"Here, (1) a bhikkhu has a keen desire to undertake the training and does not lose his fondness for undertaking the training in the future. (2) He has a strong desire to attend to the Dhamma and does not lose his fondness for attending to the Dhamma in the future. (3) He has a strong desire to remove vain wishes and does not lose his fondness for removing vain wishes in the future. ${ }^{1473}$ (4) He has a strong desire for seclusion and does not lose his fondness for seclusion in the future.

(7) He has a strong desire to penetrate by view and does not lose his fondness for penetrating by view in the future. These are the seven bases for [being] 'ten-less.'"

# III. The Vajji Seven

## 21 (1) Sārandada

[16] Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī at the Sārandada Shrine. Then a number of Licchavis approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One said this to them:

"I will teach you, Licchavis, seven principles of non-decline. Listen and attend closely. I will speak."1474

"Yes, Bhante," those Licchavis replied. The Blessed One said this:

"And what, Licchavis, are the seven principles of nondecline?
(1) "Licchavis, as long as the Vajjis assemble often and hold frequent assemblies, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(2) "As long as the Vajjis assemble in harmony, adjourn in harmony, and conduct the affairs of the Vajjis in harmony, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(3) "As long as the Vajjis do not decree anything that has not been decreed or abolish anything that has already been decreed but undertake and follow the ancient Vajji principles as they have been decreed, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(4) "As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Vajji elders and think they should be heeded, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(5) "As long as the Vajjis do not abduct women and girls from their families and force them to live with them, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(6) "As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate their traditional shrines, both those within [the city] ${ }^{1475}$ and those outside, [17] and do not neglect the righteous oblations as given and done to them in the past, ${ }^{1476}$ only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(7) "As long as the Vajjis provide righteous protection, shelter, and guard for arahants, [with the intention]: 'How can those arahants who have not yet come here come to our realm, and how can those arahants who have already come dwell at ease here?' only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

"Licchavis, as long as these seven principles of non-decline continue among the Vajjis, and the Vajjis are seen [established] in them, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline."

# 22 (2) Vassakāra ${ }^{1477}$

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Now on that occasion King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha wished to wage war against the Vajjis. He said thus: "As powerful and mighty as these Vajjis are, I will annihilate them, destroy them, bring calamity and disaster upon them."

Then King Ajātasattu addressed the chief minister of Magadha, the brahmin Vassakāra: "Come, brahmin, go to the

Blessed One and in my name pay homage to him with your head at his feet. Inquire whether he is fit and healthy, agile and strong, and feeling at ease. Say: 'Bhante, King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha pays homage to the Blessed One with his head at your feet. He inquires whether you are fit and healthy, agile and strong, and feeling at ease.' Then say thus: 'Bhante, King Ajātasattu wishes to wage war against the Vajjis. He says thus: "As powerful and mighty as these Vajjis are, I will annihilate them, destroy them, bring calamity and disaster upon [18] them."' Learn well how the Blessed One answers you and report it to me, for Tathāgatas do not speak falsely."

"Yes, sir," the brahmin Vassakāra replied. Then he rose from his seat and went to the Blessed One. He exchanged greetings with the Blessed One, and when they had exchanged greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said:

"Master Gotama, King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha pays homage to the Blessed One with his head at your feet. He inquires whether you are fit and healthy, agile and strong, and feeling at ease. Master Gotama, King Ajātasattu wishes to wage war against the Vajjis. He says thus: 'As powerful and mighty as these Vajjis are, I will annihilate them, destroy them, bring calamity and disaster upon them.'"

Now on that occasion the Venerable Ānanda was standing behind the Blessed One fanning him. The Blessed One then addressed the Venerable Ānanda:

(1) "Ānanda, have you heard whether the Vajjis are assembling often and holding frequent assemblies?"

"I have heard, Bhante, that they do so."

"Ānanda, as long as the Vajjis assemble often and hold frequent assemblies, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(2) "Have you heard, Ānanda, whether the Vajjis are assembling in harmony, adjourning their meetings in harmony, and conducting the affairs of the Vajjis in harmony?"

"I have heard, Bhante, that they do so."

"Ānanda, as long as the Vajjis assemble in harmony, [19] adjourn in harmony, and conduct the affairs of the Vajjis in harmony, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(3) "Have you heard, Ānanda, whether the Vajjis do not decree anything that has not been decreed and do not abolish
anything that has already been decreed, but undertake and follow the ancient Vajji principles as they have been decreed?"

"I have heard, Bhante, that they do so."

"Ānanda, as long as the Vajjis do not decree anything that has not been decreed or abolish anything that has already been decreed but undertake and follow the ancient Vajji principles as they have been decreed, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(4) "Have you heard, Ānanda, whether the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Vajji elders and think they should be heeded?"

"I have heard, Bhante, that they do so."

"Ānanda, as long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Vajji elders and think they should be heeded, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(5) "Have you heard, Ānanda, whether the Vajjis do not abduct women and girls from their families and force them to live with them?"

"I have heard, Bhante, that they don't."

"Ānanda, as long as the Vajjis do not abduct women and girls from their families and force them to live with them, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(6) "Have you heard, Ānanda, whether the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate their traditional shrines, both those within [the city] and those outside, and do not neglect the righteous oblations as given and done to them in the past?"

"I have heard, Bhante, that they do so."

"Ānanda, as long as the Vajjis [20] honor, respect, esteem, and venerate their traditional shrines, both those within [the city] and those outside, and do not neglect the righteous oblations as given and done to them in the past, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(7) "Have you heard, Ānanda, whether the Vajjis provide righteous protection, shelter, and guard for arahants, [with the intention]: 'How can those arahants who have not yet come here come to our realm, and how can those arahants who have already come dwell at ease here?""

"I have heard, Bhante, that they do so."

"Ānanda, as long as the Vajjis provide righteous protection, shelter, and guard for arahants, [with the intention]: 'How can those arahants who have not yet come here come to our
realm, and how can those arahants who have already come dwell at ease here?' only growth is to be expected for them, not decline."

Then the Blessed One addressed the brahmin Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha: "On one occasion, brahmin, I was dwelling at Vesālī at the Sārandada Shrine. There I taught the Vajjis these seven principles of non-decline. As long as these seven principles of non-decline continue among the Vajjis, and the Vajjis are seen [established] in them, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline."

When this was said, the brahmin Vassakāra said this to the Blessed One: "If, Master Gotama, the Vajjis were to observe even one among these principles of non-decline, only growth would be expected for them, not decline. What can be said if they observe all seven? King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha, Master Gotama, cannot take the Vajjis by war, except [21] through treachery or internal dissension. And now, Master Gotama, we must be going. We are busy and have much to do."

"You may go, brahmin, at your own convenience."

Then the brahmin Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One's words, rose from his seat and left.

# 23 (3) Non-Decline (1)

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you seven principles of non-decline. Listen and attend closely. I will speak."1478

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"And what, bhikkhus, are the seven principles of nondecline?

(1) "As long as the bhikkhus assemble often and hold frequent assemblies, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(2) "As long as the bhikkhus assemble in harmony, adjourn in harmony, and conduct the affairs of the Sangha in harmony, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(5) "As long as the bhikkhus do not come under the control of arisen craving that leads to renewed existence, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(6) "As long as the bhikkhus are intent on forest lodgings, [22] only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

(7) "As long as the bhikkhus each individually establish mindfulness [with the intention]: 'How can well-behaved fellow monks who have not yet come here come, and how can well-behaved fellow monks who are already here dwell at ease?' only growth is to be expected for them, not decline.

"Bhikkhus, as long as these seven principles of non-decline continue among the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus are seen [established] in them, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline."

# 24 (4) Non-Decline (2)

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you seven principles of non-decline. Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"And what, bhikkhus, are the seven principles of nondecline?

(1) "As long as the bhikkhus do not delight in work, do not take delight in work, are not devoted to delight in work, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline. (2) As long as the bhikkhus do not delight in talk... (3) ... do not delight in sleep ... (4) ... do not delight in company ...

"Bhikkhus, as long as these seven principles of non-decline continue among the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus are seen [established] in them, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline."

# 25 (5) Non-Decline (3)

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you seven principles of non-decline. Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this: [23]

"And what, bhikkhus, are the seven principles of nondecline?

(1) "As long as the bhikkhus are endowed with faith, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline. (2) As long as they have a sense of moral shame...(3)...have moral dread...(4) ... are learned...(5) ... are energetic...(6) ... are mindful...

"Bhikkhus, as long as these seven principles of non-decline continue among the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus are seen [established] in them, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline."

## 26 (6) Non-Decline (4)

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you seven principles of non-decline. Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"And what, bhikkhus, are the seven principles of nondecline? (1) As long as the bhikkhus develop the enlightenment factor of mindfulness, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline. (2) As long as they develop the enlightenment factor of discrimination of phenomena... (3) ... the enlightenment factor of energy ... (4) ... the enlightenment factor of rapture ...

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you seven principles of non-decline. Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

(2) As long as they develop the perception of non-self ... (3) ... the perception of unattractiveness... (4) ... the perception of danger... (5) ... the perception of abandoning ...

"Bhikkhus, as long as these seven principles of non-decline continue among the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus are seen [established] in them, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline."

## 28 (8) A Trainee

"Bhikkhus, these seven qualities lead to the decline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee. What seven? Delight in work, delight in talk, delight in sleep, delight in company, not guarding the doors of the sense faculties, lack of moderation in eating; and when there are matters pertaining to the Sangha that are [to be dealt with] in the Sangha, the bhikkhu who is a trainee does not reflect thus: ${ }^{1481}$ "There are in the Sangha elders of long standing, long gone forth, responsible, who will take responsibility for that [work].' He himself undertakes them. ${ }^{1482}$ These seven qualities lead to the decline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee.

"Bhikkhus, these seven qualities lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee. What seven? [25] Not taking delight in work, not taking delight in talk, not taking delight in sleep, not taking delight in company, guarding the doors of the sense faculties, moderation in eating; and when there are matters pertaining to the Sangha that are [to be dealt with] in the Sangha, the bhikkhu who is a trainee reflects thus: 'There are in the Sangha elders of long standing, long gone forth, respon-
sible, who will take responsibility for that [work].' He does not himself undertake them. These seven qualities lead to the nondecline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee."

# 29 (9) Decline

"Bhikkhus, these seven things lead to the decline of a lay follower. What seven? (1) He stops seeing bhikkhus; (2) he neglects listening to the good Dhamma; (3) he does not train in the higher virtuous behavior; (4) he is full of suspicion toward bhikkhus, whether they be elders, newly ordained, or of middle standing; (5) he listens to the Dhamma with a mind bent on criticism, seeking to find faults with it; (6) he seeks a person worthy of offerings among outsiders; (7) he first does [meritorious] deeds there. ${ }^{1483}$ These seven things lead to the decline of a lay follower.

## IV. Deities

## 32 (1) Heedfulness ${ }^{1486}$

Then, when the night had advanced, a certain deity of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta's Grove, [28] approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and said to the Blessed One:
"Bhante, there are these seven qualities that lead to the nondecline of a bhikkhu. What seven? Reverence for the Teacher, reverence for the Dhamma, reverence for the Sangha, reverence for the training, reverence for concentration, reverence for heedfulness, and reverence for hospitality. These seven qualities lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu."

This is what that deity said. The Teacher agreed. Then that deity, [thinking]: "The Teacher agrees with me," paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and disappeared right there.

Then, when the night had passed, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Last night, bhikkhus, when the night had advanced, a certain deity of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta's Grove, approached me, paid homage to me, stood to one side, and said to me: 'Bhante, there are these seven qualities that lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu. What seven? Reverence for the Teacher... and reverence for hospitality. These seven qualities lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu.' This is what that deity said. Then that deity paid homage to me, circumambulated me keeping the right side toward me, and disappeared right there."

Respectful toward the Teacher, respectful toward the Dhamma, deeply revering the Sangha, respectful toward concentration, ardent, deeply respectful toward the training; respectful toward heedfulness, holding hospitality in reverence: this bhikkhu cannot fall away, but is close to nibbāna.

# 33 (2) Moral Shame ${ }^{1487}$

"Last night, bhikkhus, when the night had advanced, a certain deity of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta's Grove, [29] approached me, paid homage to me, stood to one side, and said to me: 'Bhante, there are these seven qualities that lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu. What seven? Reverence for the Teacher, reverence for the Dhamma, reverence for the Sangha, reverence for the training, reverence for concentration,
reverence for a sense of moral shame, and reverence for moral dread. These seven qualities lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu.' This is what that deity said. Then the deity paid homage to me, circumambulated me keeping the right side toward me, and disappeared right there."

Respectful toward the Teacher, respectful toward the Dhamma, deeply revering the Sangha, respectful toward concentration, ardent, deeply respectful toward the training; endowed with moral shame and moral dread, deferential and reverential: such a one cannot fall away but is close to nibbāna.

# 34 (3) Easy to Correct (1)

"Last night, bhikkhus, when the night had advanced, a certain deity of sturning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta's Grove, approached me, paid homage to me, stood to one side, and said to me: 'Bhante, there are these seven qualities that lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu. What seven? Reverence for the Teacher, reverence for the Dhamma, reverence for the Sangha, reverence for the training, reverence for concentration, being easy to correct, and good friendship. These seven qualities lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu.' This is what that deity said. Then the deity paid homage to me, circumambulated me keeping the right side toward me, and disappeared right there."

Respectful toward the Teacher, respectful toward the Dhamma, deeply revering the Sangha, respectful toward concentration, ardent, deeply respectful toward the training; cultivating good friends, being easy to correct; deferential and reverential: such a one cannot fall away but is close to nibbāna. [30]

35 (4) Easy to Correct (2) ${ }^{1488}$

"Last night, bhikkhus, when the night had advanced, a certain deity of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta's Grove, approached me, paid homage to me, stood to one side, and said to me: 'Bhante, there are these seven qualities that lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu.

These seven qualities lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu.' This is what that deity said. Then the deity paid homage to me, circumambulated me keeping the right side toward me, and disappeared right there."

When this was said, the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Blessed One:

"Bhante, I understand in detail the meaning of this statement that the Blessed One has spoken in brief to be as follows. Here, a bhikkhu himself reveres the Teacher and speaks in praise of reverence for the Teacher; he encourages other bhikkhus who do not revere the Teacher to develop reverence for the Teacher and, at the proper time, genuinely and truthfully, he speaks praise of those bhikkhus who revere the Teacher. He himself reveres the Dhamma . . . reveres the Sangha . . . reveres the training ... reveres concentration... is easy to correct... has good friends and speaks in praise of good friendship; he encourages other bhikkhus who do not have good friends to find good friends and, at the proper time, genuinely and truthfully, he speaks praise of those bhikkhus who have good friends. It is in such a way, Bhante, that I understand in detail the meaning of this statement that the Blessed One has spoken in brief."

[The Blessed One said:] "Good, good, Sāriputta! It is good that you understand in detail the meaning of this statement that I have spoken in brief in such a way."

[The Buddha here repeats the whole statement of Sāriputta, ending:] [31]

"It is in such a way, Sāriputta, that the meaning of this statement that I spoke in brief should be understood in detail."

36 (5) A Friend (1) ${ }^{1489}$

"Bhikkhus, one should associate with a friend who possesses seven factors. What seven? (1) He gives what is hard to give.
(2) He does what is hard to do. (3) He patiently endures what is hard to endure. (4) He reveals his secrets to you. (5) He preserves your secrets. (6) He does not forsake you when you are in trouble. (7) He does not roughly despise you. ${ }^{1490}$ One should associate with a friend who possesses these seven factors."

A friend gives what is hard to give, and he does what is hard to do.

He forgives you your harsh words and endures what is hard to endure.

He tells you his secrets, yet he preserves your secrets.

He does not forsake you in difficulties, nor does he roughly despise you.

The person here in whom

these qualities are found is a friend.

One desiring a friend

should resort to such a person. [32]

# 37 (6) A Friend (2)

"Bhikkhus, one should associate with a bhikkhu friend who possesses seven qualities; one should resort to him and attend on him even if he dismisses you. What seven? (1) He is pleasing and agreeable; (2) he is respected and (3) esteemed; (4) he is a speaker; ${ }^{1491}$ (5) he patiently endures being spoken to; (6) he gives deep talks; and (7) he does not enjoin one to do what is wrong."

He is dear, respected, and esteemed, a speaker and one who endures speech;

he gives deep talks and does not enjoin one to do what is wrong.

The person here in whom

these qualities are found is a friend, benevolent and compassionate.

Even if one is dismissed by him, one desiring a friend

should resort to such a person.

38 (7) Analytical Knowledges (1)

"Bhikkhus, when he possesses seven qualities, a bhikkhu might soon realize for himself with direct knowledge the four analytical knowledges and acquire mastery over them. ${ }^{1492}$ What seven?

"Here, (1) a bhikkhu understands as it really is: 'This is mental sluggishness in me. ${ }^{1493}$ (2) Or when the mind is constricted internally, he understands as it really is: 'My mind is constricted internally.' (3) Or when his mind is distracted externally, he understands as it really is: 'My mind is distracted externally. ${ }^{1494}$ (4) He knows feelings as they arise, as they remain present, as they disappear; (5) he knows perceptions as they arise, as they remain present, [33] as they disappear; (6) he knows thoughts as they arise, as they remain present, as they disappear. ${ }^{1495}$ (7) Then, among qualities suitable and unsuitable, inferior and superior, dark and bright along with their counterparts, he has grasped the mark well, attended to it well, reflected upon it well, and penetrated it well with wisdom. ${ }^{1496}$ When he possesses these seven qualities, a bhikkhu might soon realize for himself with direct knowledge the four analytical knowledges and acquire mastery over them."

39 (8) Analytical Knowledges (2) ${ }^{1497}$

"Bhikkhus, when he possessed seven qualities, Sāriputta realized for himself with direct knowledge the four analytical knowledges and acquired mastery over them. What seven?

"Here, (1) Sāriputta understood as it really is: 'This is mental sluggishness in me. ${ }^{1498}$ (2) Or when the mind was constricted internally, he understood as it really is: 'My mind is constricted internally.' (3) Or when his mind was distracted externally, he understood as it really is: 'My mind is distracted externally.'

(7) Then, among qualities suitable and unsuitable, inferior and superior, dark and bright along with their counterparts, he took up the mark well, attended to it well, reflected upon it well, and penetrated it well with wisdom. When he possessed these seven qualities, Sāriputta realized for
himself with direct knowledge the four analytical knowledges and acquired mastery over them." [34]

40 (9) Mastery (1)

"Bhikkhus, possessing seven qualities, a bhikkhu exercises mastery over his mind and is not a servant of his mind. What seven? Here, (1) a bhikkhu is skilled in concentration, (2) skilled in the attainment of concentration, (3) skilled in the duration of concentration, (4) skilled in emergence from concentration, (5) skilled in fitness for concentration, (6) skilled in the area of concentration, and (7) skilled in resolution regarding concentration. ${ }^{1499}$ Possessing these seven qualities, a bhikkhu exercises mastery over his mind, and is not a servant of his mind."

Possessing these seven qualities, Sāriputta exercises mastery over his mind and is not a servant of his mind."

42 (11) Bases for [Being] "Ten-less" (1)

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Then, in the morning, the Venerable Sāriputta dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Sāvatthī for alms. It then occurred to him: [35] "It is still too early to walk for alms in Sāvatthī. Let me go to the park of the wanderers of other sects."

Then the Venerable Sāriputta went to the park of the wanderers of other sects. He exchanged greetings with those wanderers and, when they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, sat down to one side. Now on that occasion those wanderers had assembled and were sitting together when this conversation arose among them: "Friends, anyone at all who lives the complete and purified spiritual life for twelve years is fit to be called a bhikkhu who is 'ten-less.'"

Then the Venerable Sāriputta neither delighted in nor rejected the statement of those wanderers, but rose from his seat and left, [thinking]: "I shall find out what the Blessed One has to say about this statement."

Then, when the Venerable Sāriputta had walked for alms in Sāvatthī, after his meal, on returning from his alms round, he approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. [He here reports verbatim the entire course of events and asks:] [36] "Is it possible, Bhante, in this Dhamma and discipline to describe a bhikkhu as 'ten-less' by the mere counting of years?"

"In this Dhamma and discipline, Sāriputta, it isn't possible to describe a bhikkhu as 'ten-less' by the mere counting of years. There are, Sāriputta, these seven bases for [being] 'ten-less' that I have proclaimed after realizing them for myself with direct knowledge. ${ }^{1501}$ What seven? Here, (1) a bhikkhu has a keen desire to undertake the training and does not lose his fondness for undertaking the training in the future. (2) He has a strong desire to attend to the Dhamma and does not lose his fondness for attending to the Dhamma in the future. (3) He has a strong desire to remove vain wishes and does not lose his fondness for removing vain wishes in the future. (4) He has a strong desire for seclusion and does not lose his fondness for seclusion in the future. (5) He has a strong desire to arouse energy and does not lose his fondness for arousing energy in the future. (6) He has a strong desire for mindfulness and alertness and does not lose his fondness for mindfulness and alertness in the future. (7) He has a strong desire to penetrate by view and does not lose his fondness for penetrating by view in the future. These are the seven bases for [being] 'ten-less' that I have proclaimed after realizing them for myself with direct knowledge.

"Sāriputta, if a bhikkhu possesses these seven bases for [being] 'ten-less,' then, if he lives the complete and pure spiritual life for twelve years, he is fit to be called 'ten-less.' If, too, he lives the complete and pure spiritual life for twenty-four years, he is [37] fit to be called 'ten-less.' If, too, he lives the complete and pure spiritual life for thirty-six years, he is fit to be called 'ten-less.' If, too, he lives the complete and pure spiritual life for forty-eight years, he is fit to be called 'ten-less.'"

43 (12) Bases for [Being] "Ten-less" (2)

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambi in Ghosita's Park. Then, in the morning, the Venerable Ānanda dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Kosambi for alms. It then occurred to him: "It is still too early to walk for alms in Kosambi. Let me go to the park of the wanderers of other sects."

Then the Venerable Ānanda went to the park of the wanderers of other sects... [as in 7:42, substituting Ānanda for Säriputta and Kọsambī for Sāvatthī] [38] . . "Is it possible, Bhante, in this Dhamma and discipline to describe a bhikkhu as 'ten-less' by the mere counting of years?"

"In this Dhamma and discipline, Ānanda, it isn't possible to describe a bhikkhu as 'ten-less' by the mere counting of years. There are, Ānanda, these seven bases for [being] 'ten-less' that I have proclaimed after realizing them for myself with direct knowledge. What seven? Here, a bhikkhu has (1) faith, (2) a sense of moral shame, (3) moral dread; (4) he is learned, (5) energetic, (6) mindful, and (7) wise. These are the seven bases for [being] 'ten-less' that I have proclaimed after realizing them for myself with direct knowledge. [39]

"Ānanda, if a bhikkhu possesses these seven bases for [being] 'ten-less,' then, if he lives the complete and pure spiritual life for twelve years, he is fit to be called 'ten-less.' If, too, he lives the complete and pure spiritual life for twenty-four years, he is fit to be called 'ten-less.' If, too, he lives the complete and pure spiritual life for thirty-six years, he is fit to be called 'ten-less.' If, too, he lives the complete and pure spiritual life for forty-eight years, he is fit to be called 'ten-less.'"

# V. The Great Sacrifice

44 (1) Stations

"Bhikkhus, there are these seven stations for consciousness. ${ }^{1502}$ What seven?

(1) "There are, bhikkhus, beings that are different in body and different in perception, such as humans, some devas, and some in the lower world. This is the first station for consciousness. ${ }^{1503}[40]$

(2) "There are beings that are different in body but identical in perception, such-as-the-devas-of-Brahmā's company that are
reborn through the first [jhāna]. This is the second station for consciousness. ${ }^{1504}$

(3) "There are beings that are identical in body but different in perception, such as the 'devas of streaming radiance. This is the third station for consciousness. ${ }^{1505}$

(4) "There are beings that are identical in body and identical in perception, such as the devas of refulgent glory. This is the fourth station for consciousness. ${ }^{1506}$

(5) "There are beings that, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, [perceiving] 'space is infinite,' belong to the base of the infinity of space. This is the fifth station for consciousness.

(6) "There are beings that, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of space, [perceiving] 'consciousness is infinite,' belong to the base of the infinity of consciousness. This is the sixth station for consciousness.

(7) "There are beings that, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of consciousness, [perceiving] 'there is nothing,' belong to the base of nothingness. This is the seventh station for consciousness.

"These, bhikkhus, are the seven stations for consciousness." ${ }^{1507}$

# 45 (2) Accessories

"There are, bhikkhus, these seven accessories of concentration. What seven? Right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, and right mindfulness. One-pointedness of mind equipped with these seven factors is called noble right concentration 'with its supports' and 'with its accessories." ${ }^{\prime 1508}$ [41]

## 46 (3) Fires

"Bhikkhus, there are these seven fires. What seven? The fire of lust, the fire of hatred, the fire of delusion, the fire of those worthy of gifts, the householder's fire, the fire of those worthy of offerings, the wood fire. These are the seven fires."1509

## 47 (4) Sacrifice

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇ̣ika's Park. Now on that occasion the
brahmin Uggatasarīra had made arrangements for a great sacrifice. Five hundred bulls had been led to the post ${ }^{1510}$ for the sacrifice. Five hundred bullocks ... Five hundred heifers... Five hundred goats... Five hundred rams had been led to the post for the sacrifice.

Then the brahmin Uggatasarīra approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

"I have heard, Master Gotama, that the kindling of the sacrificial fire and the raising of the sacrificial post are of great fruit and benefit."

"I too, brahmin, have heard this."

A second time ... A third time the brahmin Uggatasarīra said to the Blessed One: "I have heard, Master Gotama, that the kindling of the sacrificial fire and the raising of the sacrificial post are of great fruit and benefit."

"I too, brahmin, have heard this."

"Then [42] Master Gotama and I are in complete and total agreement."

When this was said, the Venerable Ānanda said to the brahmin Uggatasarīra: "Brahmin, Tathāgatas should not be asked thus: 'I have heard, Master Gotama, that the kindling of the sacrificial fire and the raising of the sacrificial post are of great fruit and benefit.' Tathāgatas should be asked: 'Bhante, I want to kindle the sacrificial fire and raise the sacrificial post. Let the Blessed One exhort me and instruct me in a way that will lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time.'"

Then the brahmin Uggatasarīra said to the Blessed One: "Master Gotama, I want to kindle the sacrificial fire and raise the sacrificial post. Let Master Gotama exhort me and instruct me in a way that will lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time."

"Brahmin, one kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, raises three knives that are unwholesome and have suffering as their outcome and result. What three? The bodily knife, the verbal knife, and the mental knife.

"Brahmin, one kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, arouses such a thought
as this: 'Let so many bulls be slain in sacrifice! Let so many bullocks . . . so many heifers . . . so many goats . . . so many rams be slain in sacrifice!' Though he [thinks], 'Let me do merit,' he does demerit. Though he [thinks], 'Let me do what is wholesome,' he does what is unwholesome. Though he [thinks], 'Let me seek the path to a good destination,' he seeks the path to a bad destination. One kindling the sacrificial fire and [43] raising the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, raises this first knife, the mental one, which is unwholesome and has suffering as its outcome and result.

"Again, brahmin, one kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, utters such speech as this: 'Let so many bulls be slain in sacrifice! Let so many bullocks . . . so many heifers . . . so many goats . . . so many rams be slain in sacrifice!' Though he [thinks], 'Let me do merit,' he does demerit. Though he [thinks], 'Let me do what is wholesome,' he does what is unwholesome. Though he [thinks], 'Let me seek the path to a good destination,' he seeks the path to a bad destination. One kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, raises this second knife, the verbal one, which is unwholesome and has suffering as its outcome and result.

"Again, brahmin, one kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, first undertakes the preparations to slay the bulls in sacrifice. He first undertakes the preparations to slay the bullocks in sacrifice . . . to slay the heifers in sacrifice ... to slay the goats in sacrifice ... to slay the rams in sacrifice. Though he [thinks], 'Let me do merit,' he does demerit. Though he [thinks], 'Let me do what is wholesome,' he does what is unwholesome. Though he [thinks], 'Let me seek the path to a good destination,' he seeks the path to a bad destination. One kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, raises this third knife, the bodily one, which is unwholesome and has suffering as its outcome and result.

"Brahmin, one kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, raises these three knives that are unwholesome and have suffering as their outcome and result.

(1)-(3) "There are, brahmin, these three fires that should be
abandoned and avoided and should not be cultivated. What three? [44] The fire of lust, the fire of hatred, and the fire of delusion.

(1) "And why should the fire of lust be abandoned and avoided and not be cultivated? One excited by lust, overcome by lust, with mind obsessed by it, engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. As a consequence, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. Therefore this fire of lust should be abandoned and avoided and should not be cultivated.

(2)-(3) "And why should the fire of hatred ... the fire of delusion be abandoned and avoided and not be cultivated? One who is deluded, overcome by delusion, with mind obsessed by it, engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. As a consequence, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. Therefore this fire of delusion should be abandoned and avoided and should not be cultivated.

"These are the three fires that should be abandoned and avoided and should not be cultivated.

(4)-(6) "There are, brahmin, these three fires that should be properly and happily maintained, having honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated them. What three? [45] The fire of those worthy of gifts, the householder's fire, and the fire of those worthy of offerings.

(4) "And what is the fire of those worthy of gifts? One's mother and father are called the fire of those worthy of gifts. For what reason? Because it is from them that one has originated and come to be. ${ }^{1511}$ Therefore, this fire of those worthy of gifts should be properly and happily maintained, having honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated it.

(5) "And what is the householder's fire? One's children, wife, slaves, servants, and workers are called the householder's fire. Therefore, this householder's fire should be properly and happily maintained, having honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated it.

(6) "And what is the fire of those worthy of offerings? Those ascetics and brahmins who refrain from intoxication and heedlessness, who are settled in patience and mildness, who tame
themselves, calm themselves, and train themselves for nibbāna are called the fire of those worthy of offerings. Therefore, this fire of those worthy of offerings should be properly and happily maintained, having honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated it.

"These, brahmin, are the three fires that should be properly and happily maintained, having honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated them.

(7) "But, brahmin, this wood fire should at certain times be ignited, at certain times be looked upon with equanimity, at certain times be extinguished, and at certain times be put aside."

When this was said, the brahmin Uggatasarīra said to the Blessed One: "Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent, Master Gotama! . . [as in 6:38] . . . Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today [46] has gone for refuge for life. Master Gotama, I set free the five hundred bulls and allow them to live. I set free the five hundred bullocks and allow them to live. I set free the five hundred heifers and allow them to live. I set free the five hundred goats and allow them to live. I set free the five hundred rams and allow them to live. Let them eat green grass, drink cool water, and enjoy a cool breeze."

# 48 (5) Perceptions (1)

"Bhikkhus, these seven perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are of great fruit and benefit, culminating in the deathless, having the deathless as their consummation. What seven? The perception of unattractiveness, the perception of death, the perception of the repulsiveness of food, the perception of nondelight in the entire world, the perception of impermanence, the perception of suffering in the impermanent, and the perception of non-self in what is suffering. These seven perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are of great fruit and benefit, culminating in the deathless, having the deathless as their consummation."

"Bhikkhus, these seven perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are of great fruit and benefit, culminating in the deathless, having the deathless as their consummation. What seven? The perception of unattractiveness, the perception of death, the

"When a bhikkhu often dwells with a mind accustomed to the perception of unattractiveness, his mind shrinks away from sexual intercourse, [47] turns back from it, rolls away from it, and is not drawn toward it, and either equanimity or revulsion becomes settled in him. Just as a cock's feather or a strip of sinew, thrown into a fire, shrinks away from it, turns back from it, rolls away from it, and is not drawn toward it, so it is in regard to sexual intercourse when a bhikkhu often dwells with a mind accustomed to the perception of unattractiveness.

"If, when a bhikkhu often dwells with a mind accustomed to the perception of unattractiveness, his mind inclines to sexual intercourse, or if he does not turn away from it, ${ }^{1512}$ he should understand: 'I have not developed the perception of unattractiveness; there is no distinction between my earlier condition and my present one; ${ }^{1513}$ I have not attained the fruit of development.'

# 50 (7) Sexual Intercourse

Then the brahmin Jānussonī approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him ... and said to him:

"Does Master Gotama also claim to be one who lives the celibate life?"1515

"If, brahmin, one could rightly say of anyone: 'He lives the
complete and pure celibate life-unbroken, flawless, unblemished, unblotched,' it is precisely of me that one might say this. For I live the complete and pure celibate life-unbroken, flawless, unblemished, unblotched."

"But what, Master Gotama, is a breach, flaw, blemish, and blotch of the celibate life?"

(1) "Here, brahmin, some ascetic or brahmin, claiming to be perfectly celibate, does not actually engage in intercourse with women. But he consents to being rubbed, massaged, bathed, and kneaded by them. He relishes this, desires it, and finds satisfaction in it. This is a breach, flaw, blemish, and blotch of the celibate life. He is called one who lives an impure celibate life, one who is fettered by the bond of sexuality. He is not freed from birth, from old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish; he is not freed from suffering, I say. [55]

(2) "Again, some ascetic or brahmin, claiming to be perfectly celibate, does not actually engage in intercourse with women; nor does he consent to being rubbed, massaged, bathed, and kneaded by them. But he jokes with women, plays with them, and amuses himself with them....

(3) "... he does not joke with women, play with them, and amuse himself with them ... but he gazes and stares straight into their eyes....

(4) "... he does not gaze and stare straight into women's eyes ... but he listens to their voices behind a wall or through a rampart as they laugh, talk, sing, or weep....

(5) "... he does not listen to the voices of women behind a wall or through a rampart as they laugh, talk, sing, or weep ... but he recollects laughing, talking, and playing with them in the past....

(6) "... he does not recollect laughing, talking, and playing with women in the past... but he looks at a householder or a householder's son enjoying himself furnished and endowed with the five objects of sensual pleasure....

(7) "... he does not look at a householder or a householder's son enjoying himself furnished and endowed with the five objects of sensual pleasure, but he lives the spiritual life aspiring for [rebirth in] a certain order of devas, [thinking]: 'By this virtuous behavior, observance, austerity, or spiritual life I will
be a deva or one [in the retinue] of the devas.' He relishes this, desires it, and finds satisfaction in it. This, too, is a breach, flaw, blemish, and blotch of the celibate life. I Ie is called [56] one who lives an impure celibate life, one who is fettered by the bond of sexuality. He is not freed from birth, from old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish; he is not freed from suffering, I say.

"So long, brahmin, as I saw that I had not abandoned one or another of these seven bonds of sexuality, I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in the world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans. But when I did not see even one of these seven bonds of sexuality that I had not abandoned, then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with... its devas and humans:

"The knowledge and vision arose in me: 'Unshakable is my liberation of mind; this is my last birth; now there is no more renewed existence.'"

When this was said, the brahmin Jānussonī said to the Blessed One: "Excellent, Master Gotama!... Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life." [57]

# 51 (8) Union

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you a Dhamma exposition on union and disengagement. ${ }^{1516}$ Listen. . . .

"And what is that Dhamma exposition on union and disengagement?

"A woman, bhikkhus, attends internally to her feminine faculty, her feminine comportment, her feminine appearance, her feminine aspect, her feminine desire, her feminine voice, her feminine ornamentation. ${ }^{1517}$ She becomes excited by these and takes delight in them. Excited by them, taking delight in them, she attends externally to [a man's] masculine faculty, his masculine comportment, his masculine appearance, his masculine aspect, his masculine desire, his masculine voice, his masculine ornamentation. She becomes excited by these and takes delight in them. Excited by them, taking delight in them, she desires union externally, and she also desires the pleasure and joy that
arise on account of such union. Beings who are delighted with their femininity enter upon union with men. It is in this way that a woman does not transcend her femininity.

"A man, bhikkhus, attends internally to his masculine faculty, his masculine comportment, his masculine appearance, his masculine aspect, his masculine desire, his masculine voice, his masculine ornamentation. He becomes excited by these and takes delight in them. Excited by them, taking delight in them, he attends externally to [a woman's] feminine faculty, her feminine comportment, her feminine appearance, her feminine aspect, her feminine desire, her feminine voice, her feminine ornamentation. He becomes excited by these and takes delight in them. Excited by them, taking delight in them, he desires union externally, and he also desires the pleasure and joy that arise on account of such union. Beings who are delighted with their masculinity enter upon union with women. [58] It is in this way that a man does not transcend his masculinity.

"This is how union comes about. And how does disengagement come about?

"A woman, bhikkhus, does not attend internally to her feminine faculty . . . to her feminine ornamentation. She does not become excited by these or take delight in them. Not excited by them, not taking delight in them, she does not attend externally to [a man's] masculine faculty . . . his masculine ornamentation. She does not become excited by these or take delight in them. Not excited by them, not taking delight in them, she does not desire union externally, nor does she desire the pleasure and joy that arise on account of such union. Beings who are not delighted with their femininity become disengaged from men. It is in this way that a woman transcends her femininity.

"A man, bhikkhus, does not attend internally to his masculine faculty ... his masculine ornamentation. He does not become excited by these or take delight in them. Not excited by them, not taking delight in them, he does not attend externally to [a woman's] feminine faculty . . . her feminine ornamentation. He does not become excited by these or take delight in them. Not excited by them, not taking delight in them, he does not desire union externally, nor does he desire the pleasure and joy that arise on account of such union. Beings who are not delighted with their masculinity become disengaged from women. It is in this way [59] that a man transcends his masculinity.
"This is how disengagement comes about.

"This, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma exposition on union and disengagement."

# 52 (9) Giving

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Campā on a bank of the Gaggārā Lotus Pond. Then a number of lay followers from Campā approached the Venerable Sāriputta, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante Sāriputta, it has been a long time since we heard a Dhamma talk from the Blessed One. It would be good, Bhante, if we could get to hear a Dhamma talk from him."

"In that case, friends, you should come on the uposatha day. Perhaps then you might get to hear a Dhamma talk from the Blessed One."

"Yes, Bhante," those lay followers replied. Then, having risen from their seats, they paid homage to the Venerable Sāriputta, circumambulated him keeping their right sides toward him, and departed.

Then, on the uposatha day, those lay followers from Campā approached the Venerable Sāriputta, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. Then the Venerable Sāriputta, along with those lay followers, went to the Blessed One. They paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side, and the Venerable Sāriputta said to him: [60]

"Could it be the case, Bhante, that a gift given by someone here is not of great fruit and benefit? And could it be the case that a gift given by someone here is of great fruit and benefit?"

"It could be the case, Sāriputta, that a gift given by someone here is not of great fruit and benefit. And it could be the case that a gift given by someone here is of great fruit and benefit."

"Bhante, why is it that one gift is not of great fruit and benefit while the other is?"

(1) "Here, Sāriputta, someone gives a gift with expectations, with a bound mind, looking for rewards; he gives a gift, [thinking]: 'Having passed away, I will make use of this.' He gives that gift to an ascetic or a brahmin: food and drink; clothing and vehicles; garlands, scents, and unguents; bedding, dwellings, and lighting. What do you think, Sāriputta? Might someone give such a gift?"

"Yes, Bhante."
"In that case, Sāriputta, he gives a gift with expectations, with a bound mind, looking for rewards; he gives a gift, [thinking]: 'Having passed away, I will make use of this.' Having given such a gift, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with the devas [ruled by] the four great kings. [61] Having exhausted that kamma, psychic potency, glory, and authority, he comes back and returns to this state of being.

(2) "But, Sāriputta, someone does not give a gift with expectations, with a bound mind, looking for rewards; he does not give a gift, [thinking]: 'Having passed away, I will make use of this.' Rather, he gives a gift, [thinking]: 'Giving is good.'...

(3) "He does not give a gift, [thinking]: 'Giving is good,' but rather he gives a gift, [thinking]: 'Giving was practiced before by my father and forefathers; I should not abandon this ancient family custom.'...

(4) "He does not give a gift, [thinking]: 'Giving was practiced before . . I should not abandon this ancient family custom,' but rather he gives a gift, [thinking]: 'I cook; these people do not cook. It isn't right that I who cook should not give to those who do not cook.'...

(5) "He does not give a gift, [thinking]: 'I cook . . . to those who. do not cook,' but rather he gives a gift, [thinking]: 'Just as the. seers of old-that is, Aṭthaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Āngirasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāsetṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu-held those great sacrifices, so I will share a gift.'... ${ }^{1518}$

(6) "He does not give a gift, [thinking]: 'Just as the seers of old ... held those great sacrifices, so I will [62] share a gift,' but rather he gives a gift, [thinking]: 'When I am giving a gift my mind becomes placid, and elation and joy arise.'...

(7) "He does not give a gift, [thinking]: 'When I am giving a gift my mind becomes placid, and elation and joy arise,' but rather he gives a gift, [thinking]: 'It's an ornament of the mind, an accessory of the mind. ${ }^{1519}$ He gives that gift to an ascetic or a brahmin: food and drink; clothing and vehicles; garlands, scents, and unguents; bedding, dwellings, and lighting. What do you think, Sāriputta? Might someone give such a gift?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"In that case, Sāriputta, he does not give a gift with expectations, with a bound mind, looking for rewards; he does not give
a gift, [thinking]: 'Having passed away, I will make use of this.' He does not give a gift, [thinking]: 'Giving is good.' He does not give a gift, [thinking]: 'Giving was practiced before by my father and forefathers; I should not abandon this ancient family custom.' He does not give a gift, [thinking]: 'I cook; these people do not cook. It isn't right that I who cook should not give to those who do not cook.' He does not give a gift, [thinking]: 'Just as the seers of old ... held those great sacrifices, so I will share a gift.' He does not give a gift, [thinking]: 'When I am giving a gift my mind becomes placid, and elation and joy arise.' But rather, he gives a gift, [thinking]: 'It's an ornament of the mind, an accessory of the mind.' Having given such a gift, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with the devas of Brahmā's company. [63] Having exhausted that kamma, psychic potency, glory, and authority, he does not come back and return to this state of being.

"This, Säriputta, is the reason why a gift given by someone here is not of great fruit and benefit. And this is the reason why a gift given by someone here is of great fruit and benefit."

# 53 (10) Nandamätā

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Venerable Sāriputta and the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna were wandering on tour in Dakkhiṇāgiri together with a large Sangha of bhikkhus. Now on that occasion the female lay follower Velukaṇtakī Nandamātā, ${ }^{1520}$ having risen as the night was receding, chanted the Pārāyana.

Now on that occasion the great [deva] king Vessavana was traveling from north to south on some business. He heard the female lay follower Nandamātā chanting the Pārāyana and stood waiting until the end of her recitation. When the female lay follower Nandamātā had finished, she fell silent. Having understood that the female lay follower Nandamātā had finished her recitation, the great [deva] king Vessavana applauded: "Good, sister! Good, sister!"

"Who is that, my dear?"

"I am your brother, the great [deva] king Vessavaṇa, sister."

"Good, my dear! Then let the Dhamma exposition that I just recited be my guest's gift to you." ${ }^{1521}$
"Good, sister! And let this too [64] be your guest's gift to me: Tomorrow, before they have eaten breakfast, the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna will come to Velukantaka. You should serve them and dedicate the offering to me. That will be your guest's gift to me."

Then when the night had passed the female lay follower Nandamātā had various kinds of delicious food prepared in her own residence. Then, before they had eaten breakfast, the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna arrived in Velukantaka.

Then the female lay follower Nandamātā addressed a man: "Come, good man. Go to the monastery and announce the time to the Sangha of bhikkhus, saying: 'It is time, Bhante, the meal is ready at Lady Nandamātā's residence.'" The man replied: "Yes, madam," and he went to the monastery and delivered his message. Then the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna dressed, took their bowls and robes, and went to the residence of the female lay follower Nandamātā, where they sat down in the seats that had been prepared.

Then, with her own hands, the female lay follower Nandamātā served and satisfied with various kinds of delicious food the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna. When the Venerable Sāriputta had finished eating and had put away his bowl, she sat down to one side and the Venerable Sāriputta asked her:

"But who, Nandamātā, told you that the Sangha of bhikkhus would be approaching?"

(1) "Here, Bhante, having risen as the night was receding, I chanted the Pārāyana. . . [65] [She here relates, in the first person, the entire incident narrated above, ending with Vessavana's words: "And this will be your guest's gift to me."] . . . Bhante, let whatever merit I may have gained by this act of giving be dedicated to the happiness of the great [deva] king Vessavana."

"It's astounding and amazing, ${ }^{1522}$ Nandamātā, that you can converse ${ }^{1523}$ directly with such a powerful and influential young deva as the great [deva] king Vessavana."

(2) "Bhante, that is not the only astounding and amazing quality of mine. There is another. I had only one son, a dear and beloved boy named Nanda. The rulers seized and abducted him on some pretext and executed him. Bhante, when that boy was

"It's astounding and amazing, Nandamātā, that you can purify even the arising of a thought." ${ }^{1526}$

(3) "Bhante, that is not [66] the only astounding and amazing quality of mine. There is still another. When my husband died, he was reborn in the yakkha realm. ${ }^{1527}$ He appeared to me in his previous bodily form, but I don't recall any alteration of my mind."

"It's astounding and amazing, Nandamātā, that you can purify even the arising of a thought."

(4) "Bhante, that is not the only astounding and amazing quality of mine. There is still another. I was given to my young husband in marriage when I was a young girl, but I don't recall ever transgressing against him even in thought, much less by deed."

"It's astounding and amazing, Nandamātā, that you can purify even the arising of a thought."

(5) "Bhante, that is not the only astounding and amazing quality of mine. There is still another. Since I declared myself a lay follower, I don't recall ever intentionally transgressing any training rule."

"It's astounding and amazing, Nandamātā!"

(6) "Bhante, that is not the only astounding and amazing quality of mine. There is still another. For as much as I want, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, I enter and dwell in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. With the subsiding of thought and examination, I enter and dwell in the second jhāna, which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration, without thought and examination. With the fading away as well of rapture, I dwell equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, I experience pleasure [67] with the body; I enter and dwell in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: 'He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.' With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, I enter and dwell in the fourth jhāna, neither
painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity."

"It's astounding and amazing, Nandamātā!"

(7) "Bhante, that is not the only astounding and amazing quality of mine. There is still another. Of the five lower fetters taught by the Blessed One, I don't see any that I haven't abandoned. ${ }^{1528}$

"It's astounding and amazing, Nandamātā!"

Then the Venerable Sāriputta instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened Nandamātā with a Dhamma talk, after which he rose from his seat and departed.

# The Second Fifty

## I. UNDECLARED

## 54 (1) Undeclared

Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, [68] sat down to one side, and said: "Bhante, why is it that doubt does not arise in the instructed noble disciple about the undeclared points?"1529

"With the cessation of views, bhikkhu, doubt does not arise in the instructed noble disciple about the undeclared points.

(1) "'The Tathāgata exists after death': this is an involvement with views; 'The Tathāgata does not exist' after death': this is an involvement with views; 'The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death': this is an involvement with views; 'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death': this is an involvement with views.

"Bhikkhu, the uninstructed worldling does not understand views, their origin, their cessation, and the way leading to their cessation. For him, that view increases. He is not freed from birth, from old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish; he is not freed from suffering, I say.

"But the instructed noble disciple understands views, their origin, their cessation, and the way leading to their cessation. For him, that view ceases. He is freed from birth, from old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish; he is freed from suffering, I say.
"Knowing thus, seeing thus, the instructed noble disciple does not declare: 'The Tathāgata exists after death'; or: 'The Tathāgata does not exist after death'; or: 'The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death'; or: 'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.' Knowing thus, seeing thus, the instructed noble disciple does not make declarations regarding the undeclared points.

"Knowing thus, bhikkhu, seeing thus, the instructed noble. disciple does not tremble, does not shake, ${ }^{1530}$ does not vacillate, and does not become terrified regarding the undeclared points.

(2) "'The Tathāgata exists after death': this is an involvement with craving...(3)... this is [69] an involvement with perception... (4) ...something conceived ... (5) ... a proliferation...

"Bhikkhu, this is why doubt does not arise in the instructed noble disciple about the undeclared points."

# 55 (2) Destinations of Persons

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you seven destinations of persons and attainment of nibbāna through non-clinging. Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"And what, bhikkhus, are the seven destinations of persons? ${ }^{1531}$

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is practicing thus: 'It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be; it will not be mine. ${ }^{1532}$ I am abandoning what exists, what has come to be.' He obtains equanimity. He is not attached to existence; he is not attached to origination. He sees with correct wisdom: 'There is a higher state that is peaceful, ${ }^{1533}$ yet he has not totally realized that state. He has not totally abandoned the underlying tendency to conceit; he has not totally abandoned the underlying tendency to lust for existence; he has not totally abandoned ignorance. ${ }^{1534}$ With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna in the interval. ${ }^{1535}$

"For example, when an iron bowl has been heated all day and is struck, a chip might fly off and be extinguished. So too, a bhikkhu is practicing thus...[71]... he has not totally abandoned ignorance. With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna in the interval. ${ }^{1536}$

(2) "Then a bhikkhu is practicing thus: 'It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be; it will not be mine. I am abandoning what exists, what has come to be.' He obtains equanimity. He is not attached to existence; he is not attached to origination. He sees with correct wisdom: 'There is a higher state that is peaceful,' yet he has not totally realized that state. He has not totally abandoned the underlying tendency to conceit; he has not totally abandoned the underlying tendency to lust for existence; he has not totally abandoned ignorance. With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna in the interval.

"For example, when an iron bowl has been heated all day and is struck, a chip might fly off, rise up, and be extinguished. So
too, a bhikkhu is practicing thus.... With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna in the interval.

(3) "Then a bhikkhu is practicing thus: 'It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be; it will not be mine....'... With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna in the interval:

"For example, when an iron bowl has been heated all day and is struck, a chip might fly off, rise up, and be extinguished just before it lands on the ground. So too, a bhikkhu is practicing thus....[72]... With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna in the interval.

(4) "Then a bhikkhu is practicing thus: 'It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be; it will not be mine....'... With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna upon landing. ${ }^{1537}$

"For example, when an iron bowl has been heated all day and is struck, a chip might be produced and fly up, and upon landing on the ground it would be extinguished. So too, a bhikkhu is practicing thus. . . . With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna upon landing.

(5) "Then a bhikkhu is practicing thus: 'It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be; it will not be mine....'... With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna without exertion.

"For example, when an iron bowl has been heated all day and is struck, a chip might fly off, rise up, and fall on a small pile of straw or sticks. There it would produce a fire and smoke, but when it has exhausted that small pile of straw or sticks, if it gets no more fuel, it would be extinguished. So too, a bhikkhu is practicing thus. . . . With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna without exertion. ${ }^{1538}[73]$

(6) "Then a bhikkhu is practicing thus: 'It might not be; and it might not be mine. It will not be; it will not be mine....'.. With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna through exertion.

"For example, when an iron bowl has been heated all day and is struck, a chip might fly off, rise up, and then fall upon a wide pile of straw or sticks. There it would produce a fire and smoke,
but when it has exhausted that wide pile of straw or sticks, if it gets no more fuel, it would be extinguished. So too, a bhikkhu is practicing thus. . . . With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna through exertion.

(7) "Then a bhikkhu is practicing thus: 'It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be; it will not be mine. I am abandoning what exists, what has come to be.' He obtains equanimity. He is not attached to existence; he is not attached to origination. He sees with correct wisdom: 'There is a higher state that is peaceful,' yet he has not totally realized that state. He has not totally abandoned the underlying tendency to conceit; he has not totally abandoned the underlying tendency to lust for existence; he has not totally abandoned ignorance. With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes one bound upstream, heading toward the Akaniṭtha realm. ${ }^{1539}$

"For example, when an iron bowl has been heated all day and is struck, a chip might fly off, rise up, and then fall upon a large pile of straw or sticks. There it would produce a fire and smoke, and when it has exhausted that large [74] pile of straw or sticks, it would burn up a woods or a grove until it reaches the edge of a field, the edge of a road, the edge of a stone mountain, the edge of water, or some delightful piece of land, and then, if it gets no more fuel, it would be extinguished. So too, a bhikkhu is practicing thus. . . . With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes one bound upstream, heading toward the Akaniṭtha realm.

"These, bhikkhus, are the seven destinations of persons.

"And what, bhikkhus, is attainment of nibbāna through nonclinging? Here, a bhikkhu is practicing thus: 'It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be; it will not be mine. I am abandoning what exists, what has come to be.' He obtains equanimity. He is not attached to existence; he is not attached to origination. He sees with correct wisdom: 'There is a higher state that is peaceful,' and he has totally realized that state. He has totally abandoned the underlying tendency to conceit; he has totally abandoned the underlying tendency to lust for existence; he has totally abandoned ignorance. With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. This is -called-attainment of nibbāna through non-clinging.
"These, bhikkhus, are the seven destinations of persons and attainment of nibbāna through non-clinging."

# 56 (3) Tissa

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Then, when the night had advanced, two deities of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Vulture [75] Peak, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and 'stood to one side. One deity then said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, these bhikkhunīs are liberated."

The other said: "Bhante, these bhikkhunis are well liberated without residue remaining. ${ }^{\prime \prime 1540}$.

This is what those deities said. The Teacher agreed. Then, [thinking]: "The Teacher has agreed," they paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and disappeared right there.

Then, when the night had passed, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Last night, bhikkhus, when the night had advanced, two deities of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Vulture Peak, approached me, paid homage to me, and stood to one side. One deity then said to me: 'Bhante, these bhikkhunis are liberated.' And the other said: 'Bhante, these bhikkhunis are well liberated without residue remaining.' This is what those deities said, after which they paid homage to me, circumambulated me keeping the right side toward me, and disappeared right there."

Now on that occasion the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was sitting not far from the Blessed One. Then it occurred to the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna: "Which devas know one who has a residue remaining as 'one with a residue remaining' and one who has no residue remaining as 'one without residue remaining'?"

Now at that time a bhikkhu named Tissa had recently died and been reborn in a certain brahmā world. There too they knew him as "the brahmā Tissa, powerful and mighty." Then, just as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna disappeared from Mount Vulture Peak and reappeared in that brahmā world. Having seen the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna coming in the distance, the brahmā Tissa [76] said to him:
"Come, respected Moggallāna! Welcome, respected Moggallāna! It has been long since you took the opportunity to come here. Sit down, respected Moggallāna. This seat has been prepared." The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna sat down on the prepared seat. The brahmā Tissa then paid homage to the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna and sat down to one side. The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna then said to him:

"Which devas, Tissa, know one who has a residue remaining as 'one with a residue remaining' and 'one who has no residue remaining as 'one without residue remaining'?"

"The devas of Brahmā's company have such knowledge, respected Moggallāna."

"Do all the devas of Brahmā's company have such knowledge, Tissa?"

"Not all, respected Moggallāna. Those devas of Brahmā's company who are content with a brahmā's life span, a brahmā's beauty, a brahmā's happiness, a brahmā's glory, a brahmā's authority, and who do not understand as it really is an escape higher than this, do not have such knowledge.

"But those devas of Brahmā's company who are not content with a brahmā's life span, a brahmā's beauty, a brahmā's happiness, a brahmā's glory, a brahmā's authority, and who [77] understand as it really is an escape higher than this, know one who has a residue remaining as 'one with a residue remaining' and one who has no residue remaining as 'one without residue remaining. ${ }^{1541}$

(1) "Here, respected Moggallāna, when a bhikkhu is liberated in both respects, those devas know him thus: 'This venerable one is liberated in both respects. As long as his body stands devas and humans will see him, but with the breakup of the body, devas and humans will see him no more.' It is in this way that those devas know one who has a residue remaining as 'one with a residue remaining' and one who has no residue remaining as 'one without residue remaining.'

(2) "Then, when a bhikkhu is liberated by wisdom, those devas know him thus: 'This venerable one is liberated by wisdom. As long as his body stands devas and humans will see him, but with the breakup of the body devas and humans will see him no more.' It is in this way, too, that those devas know one who has a residue remaining.
(3) "Then, when a bhikkhu is a body witness, those devas know him thus: 'This venerable one is a body witness. If this venerable one resorts to congenial lodgings, relies on good friends, and harmonizes the spiritual faculties, perhaps he will realize for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having entered upon it, dwell in it.' It is in this way, too, that those devas know one who has a residue remaining....

(4) "Then, when a bhikkhu is one attained to view ... (5) one liberated by faith ... (6) a Dhamma follower, those devas know him thus: 'This venerable one [78] is a Dhamma follower. If this venerable one resorts to congenial lodgings, relies on good friends, and harmonizes the spiritual faculties, perhaps he will realize for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having entered upon it, dwell in it.' It is in this way, too, that those devas know one who has a residue remaining as 'one with a residue remaining' and one who has no residue remaining as 'one without residue remaining.'

Then, having delighted and rejoiced in the words of the brahmā Tissa; just as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna disappeared from the brahmā world and reappeared on Vulture Peak. He approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and reported to the Blessed One his entire conversation with the brahmā Tissa.

[The Blessed One said:] "But, Moggallāna, didn't the brahmā Tissa teach you about the seventh person, the one who dwells in the markless?"1542

"It is the time for this, Blessed One! It is the time for this, Fortunate One! The Blessed One should teach about the seventh person, the one who dwells in the markless. Having heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will retain it in mind."

"Then listen, Moggallāna, and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna replied. The Blessed One said this:

(7) "Here, Moggallāna, through non-attention to all marks, a
bhikkhu enters and dwells in the markless mental concentration. Those devas know him thus: 'Through non-attention to all marks, this venerable one enters and dwells in the markless mental concentration. If this venerable one resorts to congenial lodgings, relies on good friends, and harmonizes the spiritual faculties, perhaps he will realize for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, [79] and having entered upon it, dwell in it.' It is in this way, too, that those devas know one who has a residue remaining as 'one with a residue remaining' and one who has no residue remaining as 'one without residue remaining.'"

# 57 (4) Sîha ${ }^{1543}$

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesälī in the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roof. Then Siha the general approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:

"Is it possible, Bhante, to point out a directly visible fruit of giving?"

"Well then, Sîha, I will question you about this matter. You should answer as you see fit."

(1) "What do you think, Sîha? There might be two persons, one without faith who is miserly, mean, and abusive, and another endowed with faith, a munificent giver who delights in charity. What do you think, Sîha? To whom would the arahants first show compassion: to the one without faith who is miserly, mean, and abusive, or to the one endowed with faith, a munificent giver who delights in charity? ${ }^{\prime 1544}$

"Why, Bhante, would the arahants first show compassion to the person without faith who isimiserly, mean, and abusive? They would first show compassion to the one endowed with faith, a munificent giver who delights in charity."

(2) "What do you think, Sîha? Whom would the arahants approach first: the one without faith who is miserly, mean, and abusive, or [80] the one endowed with faith, a munificent giver who delights in charity?"

"Why, Bhante, would the arahants first approach the person without faith who is miserly, mean, and abusive? They would
first approach the one endowed with faith, a munificent giver who delights in charity."

(3) "What do you think, Sïha? From whom would the arahants first receive alms: from the one without faith who is miserly, mean, and abusive, or from the one endowed with faith, a munificent giver who delights in charity?"

"Why, Bhante, would the arahants first receive alms from the person without faith who is miserly, mean, and abusive? They would first receive alms from the one endowed with faith, a munificent giver who delights in charity."

(4) "What do you think, Siha? To whom would the arahants first teach the Dhamma: to the one without faith who is miserly, mean, and abusive, or to the one endowed with faith, a munificent giver who delights in charity?"

"Why, Bhante, would the arahants first teach the Dhamma to the person without faith who is miserly, mean, and abusive? They would first teach the Dhamma to the one endowed with faith, a munificent giver who delights in charity."

(5) "What do you think, Siha? Which person would acquire a good reputation: the one without faith who is miserly, mean, and abusive, or the one endowed with faith, a munificent giver who delights in charity?"

"How, Bhante, would the person without faith who is miserly, mean, and abusive acquire a good reputation? It is the person endowed with faith, a munificent giver who delights in charity, who would acquire a good reputation."

(6) "What do you think, Siha? Which person would approach any assembly-whether of khattiyas, brahmins, householders, or ascetics-[81] confidently and composed: the one without faith who is miserly, mean, and abusive, or the one endowed with faith, a munificent giver who delights in charity?"

"How, Bhante, could the person without faith, who is miserly, mean, and abusive, approach any assembly-whether of khattiyas, brahmins, householders, or ascetics-confidently and composed? It is the person endowed with faith, a munificent giver who delights in charity, who would approach any assembly . . . confidently and composed."

(7) "What do you think, Siha? With the breakup of the body, after death, which person would be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world: the one without faith who is miserly,
mean, and abusive, or the one endowed with faith, a munificent giver who delights in charity?"

"How, Bhante, could the person without faith who is miserly, mean, and abusive be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world, with the breakup of the body, after death? It is the person endowed with faith, a munificent giver who delights in charity, who would be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world, with the breakup of the body, after death.

"Bhante, I do not go by faith in the Blessed One concerning those six directly visible fruits of giving declared by him. I know them, too. For I am a donor, a munificent giver, and the arahants first show compassion to me. I am a donor, a munificent giver, and the arahants first approach me. I am a donor, a munificent giver, and the'arahants first receive alms from me. I am a donor, a munificent giver, and the arahants first teach the Dhamma to me. I am a donor, a munificent giver, and I have acquired a good reputation: 'Sīha the general is a donor, a sponsor, a supporter of the Sangha.' [82] I am a donor, a munificent giver, and whatever assembly I approach-whether of khattiyas, brahmins, householders, or ascetics-I approach it confidently and composed. I do not go by faith in the Blessed One concerning these six directly visible fruits of giving declared by him. I know them, too. But when the Blessed One tells me: 'Sīha, with the breakup of the body, after death, a donor, a munificent giver, is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world,' I do not know this, and here I go by faith in the Blessed One."

"So it is, Sīha, so it is! With the breakup of the body, after death, a donor, a munificent giver, is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world."

# 58 (5) No Need to Hide

"Bhikkhus, there are these four things that the Tathāgata does not need to hide and three things about which he is irreproachable. ${ }^{1545}$

"What are the four things that the Tathāgata does not need to hide?

(1) "Bhikkhus, the Tathāgata is one whose bodily behavior is purified. There is no bodily misconduct on the part of the Tathāgata that he might need to hide, [thinking]: 'Let others not find this out about me.'
(2) "The Tathāgata is one whose verbal behavior is purified. There is no verbal misconduct on the part of the Tathāgata that he might need to hide, [thinking]: 'Let others not find this out about me.'

(3) "The Tathāgata is one whose mental behavior is purified. There is no mental misconduct on the part of the Tathāgata that he might need to hide, [thinking]: 'Let others not find this out about me.'

(4) "The Tathāgata is one whose livelihood is purified. There is no wrong livelihood on the part of the Tathāgata that he might need to hide, [thinking]: 'Let others not find this out about me.'

"These are the four things that the Tathāgata does not need to hide. And what are the three things about which he is irreproachable? [83]

(5) "The Tathāgata, bhikkhus, is one whose Dhamma is well expounded. In regard to this, I do not see any ground on the basis of which an ascetic, brahmin, deva, Māra, Brahmā, or anyone in the world could reasonably reprove me: 'For such and such reasons, your Dhamma is not well expounded.' Since I do not see any such ground, I dwell secure, fearless, and selfconfident.

(6) "I have well proclaimed to my disciples the practice leading to nibbāna in such a way that, practicing in accordance with it [and reaching] the destruction of the taints, they realize for themselves with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwell in it.

Since I do not see any such ground, I dwell secure, fearless, and self-confident.

taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwell in it. In regard to this, I do not see any ground on the basis of which an ascetic, brahmin, deva, Māra, Brahmā, or anyone in the world could reasonably reprove me: 'For such and such reasons, it is not the case that your assembly consists of many hundreds of disciples who have destroyed the taints and realized for themselves with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwell in it.'

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kimbila in a nicula grove. Then the Venerable Kimbila approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:

"What is the cause and reason why, Bhante, the good Dhamma does not continue long after a Tathāgata has attained final nibbāna?"

"Here, Kimbila, after a Tathāgata has attained final nibbāna, (1) the bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, male lay followers, and female lay followers dwell without reverence and deference toward the Teacher. (2) They dwell without reverence and deference toward the Dhamma. (3) They dwell without reverence and deference toward the Sangha. (4) They dwell without reverence and deference toward the training. (5) They dwell without reverence and deference toward concentration. (6) They dwell without reverence and deference toward heedfulness. (7) They dwell without reverence and deference toward hospitality. This is the cause and reason why the good Dhamma does not continue long after a Tathāgata has attained final nibbāna."

"What is the cause and reason why, Bhante, the good Dhamma continues long after a Tathāgata has attained final nibbāna?"
"Here, Kimbila, after a Tathāgata has attained final nibbāna; (1) the bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, male lay followers, and female lay followers dwell with reverence and deference toward the Teacher.

# 60 (7) Seven Qualities

"Bhikkhus, possessing seven qualities, a bhikkhu can before long, with the destruction of the taints, realize for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwell in it. What seven?

"Here, a bhikkhu is endowed with faith, virtuous, learned, secluded, energetic, mindful, and wise. Possessing these seven qualities, a bhikkhu can before long, with the destruction of the taints, realize for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, can dwell in it."

## 61 (8) Dozing

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Bhaggas at Sumsumāragira, in the deer park at Bhesakalā Grove. Now on that occasion the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was sitting and dozing ${ }^{1546}$ at Kallavālamuttagāma among the Magadhans. With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, the Blessed One saw the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna sitting and dozing. Then, just as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, the Blessed One disappeared from the deer park at Bhesakalā Grove, and reappeared before the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna. The Blessed One sat down on the seat that was prepared for him and said:

"Are you dozing, Moggallāna? Are you dozing, Moggallāna?"
"Yes, Bhante."

(1) "Therefore, Moggallāna, you should not attend to or cultivate the object that you were attending to when you became drowsy. [86] By such means, it is possible that your drowsiness will be abandoned.

(2) "But if you cannot abandon your drowsiness in such a way, you should ponder, examine, and mentally inspect the Dhamma as you have heard it and learned it. By such means, it is possible that your drowsiness will be abandoned.

(3) "But if you cannot abandon your drowsiness in such a way, you should recite in detail the Dhamma as you have heard it and learned it. By such means, it is possible that your drowsiness will be abandoned.

(4) "But if you cannot abandon your drowsiness in such a way, you should pull both ears and rub your limbs with your hands. By such means, it is possible that your drowsiness will be abandoned.

(5) "But if you cannot abandon your drowsiness in such a way, you should get up from your seat, rub your eyes with water, survey all the quarters, and look up at the constellations and stars. By such means, it is possible that your drowsiness will be abandoned.

(6) "But if you cannot abandon your drowsiness in such a way, you should attend to the perception of light; you should undertake the perception of day thus: 'As by day, so at night; as at night, so by day.' Thus, with a mind that is open and uncovered, you should develop a mind imbued with luminosity. By such means, it is possible that your drowsiness will be abandoned. [87]

(7) "But if you cannot abandon your drowsiness in such a way, you should undertake [the exercise of] walking back and forth, perceiving what is behind you and what is in front, with your sense faculties drawn in and your mind collected. By such means, it is possible that your drowsiness will be abandoned.

"But if you cannot abandon your drowsiness in such a way, you should lie down on the right side in the lion's posture, with one foot overlapping the other, mindful and clearly comprehending, after noting in your mind the idea of rising. When you awaken, you should get up quickly, [thinking]: 'I will not be intent on the pleasure of rest, the pleasure of sloth, the plea-
sure of sleep.' It is in this way, Moggallāna, that you should train yourself.

"Therefore, Moggallāna, you should train yourself thus: 'We will not approach families [for alms] with a head swollen with pride.' It is in this way, Moggallāna, that you should train yourself. It may be, Moggallāna, that a bhikkhu approaches families with a head swollen with pride. Now there are chores to be done in the families, and for this reason, when a bhikkhu turns up, people may not pay attention to him. In such a case the bhikkhu might think: 'Who has turned this family against me? It seems these people have now become indifferent toward me.' In this way, through lack of gain one feels humiliated; when feeling humiliated, one becomes restless; when one is restless, one loses one's restraint. The mind of one without restraint is far from concentration.

"Therefore, Moggallāna, you should train yourself thus: 'We will not engage in contentious talk.' It is in this way that you should train yourself. When there is contentious talk, an excess of words can be expected. When there is an excess of words, one becomes restless; when one is restless, one loses one's restraint. The mind of one without restraint is far from concentration.

"Moggallāna, I do not praise bonding with everyone whatsoever, nor [88] do I praise bonding with no one at all. I do not praise bonding with householders and monastics, but I do praise bonding with quiet and noiseless lodgings far from the flurry of people, remote from human habitation, and suitable for seclusion."

When this was said, the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said to the Blessed One: ${ }^{1549}$ "Briefly, Bhante, how is a bhikkhu liberated in the extinction of craving, best among devas and humans: one who has reached the ultimate conclusion, won ultimate security from bondage, lived the ultimate spiritual life, and gained the ultimate consummation?"

"Here, Moggallāna, a bhikkhu has heard: 'Nothing is worth holding to.' When a bhikkhu has heard: 'Nothing is worth holding to,' he directly knows all things. Having directly known all things, he fully understands all things. Having fully understood all things, whatever feeling he feels-whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor pleasant-he dwells contemplating impermanence in those feelings, contemplating fading
away in those feelings, contemplating cessation in those feelings, contemplating relinquishment in those feelings. As he dwells contemplating impermanence . . fading away . . cessation... relinquishment in those feelings, he does not cling to anything in the world. Not clinging, he is not agitated. Being unagitated, he personally attains nibbāna. He understands: 'Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.'

"Briefly, Moggallāna, it is in this way that a bhikkhu is best among devas and humans: one who has reached the ultimate conclusion, won ultimate security from bondage, lived the ultimate spiritual life, and gained the ultimate consummation."

62 (9) Do Not Be Afraid of Merit ${ }^{1550}$

"Bhikkhus, do not be afraid of merit. This is a designation for happiness, [89] that is, merit.

"I recall that for a long time I experienced the desirable, lovely, agreeable result of merit that had been made over a long time. For seven years I developed a mind of loving-kindness. As a consequence, for seven eons of world-dissolution and evolution I did not come back to this world. When the world was dissolving I fared on to the [realm of] streaming radiance. When the world was evolving, I was reborn in an empty mansion of Brahmā. ${ }^{1551}$ There I was Brahmā, ${ }^{1552}$ the Great Brahmā, the vanquisher, the unvanquished, the universal seer, the wielder of mastery. I was Sakka, ruler of the devas, thirty-six times. Many hundreds of times I was a wheel-turning monarch, a righteous king who ruled by the Dhamma, a conqueror whose rule extended to the four boundaries, one who had attained stability in his country, who possessed the seven gems. I had these seven gems, that is: the wheel-gem, the elephant-gem, the horse-gem, the jewel-gem, the woman-gem, the treasurer-gem, and the adviser-gem as the seventh. I had over a thousand sons who were heroes, vigorous, able to crush the armies of their enemies. I reigned after conquering this earth as far as its ocean boundaries, not by force and weapons but by the Dhamma. ${ }^{1553}$

[^0]

[^0]:    "If one seeks happiness, look to the result

    of merit, [the result of] wholesome deeds.

    For seven years, I developed a loving mind, [90]

O bhikkhus, and for seven eons of dissolution and evolution, I did not come back again to this world.

"When the world was dissolving, I fared on to [the realm of] streaming radiance. When the world was evolving, I fared on to an empty Brahmā [mansion].

"Seven times I was Great Brahmā, the wielder of mastery;

thirty-six times I was ruler of the devas, exercising rulership over the devas.

"I was a wheel-turning monarch, the lord of Jambudīpa, ${ }^{1554}$

a head-anointed khattiya, the sovereign among human beings.

"Without force, without weapons, I conquered this earth.

I ruled it by righteousness, without violence, by Dhamma, ${ }^{1559}$ exercising rulership by Dhamma over this sphere of the earth.

"I was born into a rich family, with abundant wealth and property, [a family] endowed with all sense pleasures, and possessing the seven gems.

This is well-taught by the Buddhas, the benefactors of the world:

this is the cause of greatness by which one is called a lord of the earth. ${ }^{1556}$

"I was ${ }^{1557}$ a king bright with splendor, one with abundant wealth and commodities. I was a lord of Jambudīpa, powerful and glorious.

Who; even though of a low birth, would not place trust on hearing this? [91]
"Therefore one desiring the good, aspiring for greatness, should deeply revere the good Dhamma, recollecting the Buddhas' teaching." ${ }^{1556}$

# 63 (10) Wives

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and went to the residence of the householder Anāthapindika, where he sat down on the seat that was prepared for him.

Now on that occasion, people in Anāthapindika's residence were making an uproar and a racket. Then the householder Anāthapindika approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Householder, why are people in your residence making. such an uproar and a racket? One would think it was fishermen at a haul of fish."

"This, Bhante, is my daughter-in-law Sujātā, who is rich and has been brought here from a rich family. She doesn't obey her father-in-law, her mother-in-law, or her husband. She doesn't even honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Blessed One."

Then the Blessed One addressed Sujātā: "Come here, Sujātā."

"Yes, Bhante," she replied. She went to the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to her: [92]

"Sujātā, a man might have seven kinds of wives. What seven? One like a killer, one like a thief, one like a tyrant, one like a mother, one like a sister, one like a friend, and one like a slave. A man might have these seven kinds of wives. Which one are you?"

"Bhante, I do not understand in detail the meaning of this statement that the Blessed One has spoken in brief. Please let the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might understand in detail the meaning of this statement spoken in brief."

"Then listen and attend closely, Sujātā. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," she replied. The Blessed One said this:
"With hateful mind, devoid of sympathy, lusting for others, despising her husband, she seeks to kill the one who bought her with wealth: a wife like this is called a wife and a killer.

"When the woman's husband acquires wealth by toiling at a craft, trade, or farming, she tries to steal it, even if [he earns] but little: a wife like this is called a wife and a thief.

"The lazy glutton, unwilling to work, harsh, fierce, rough in speech, a woman who dominates her own supporters: a wife like this is called a wife and a tyrant. [93]

"One always benevolent and sympathetic, who guards her husband as a mother her son, who protects the wealth he earns: a wife like this is called a wife and a mother.

"She who holds her husband in high regard as younger sister her elder brother, conscientious, following her husband's will: a wife like this is called a wife and a sister.

"One who rejoices when she sees her husband as if seeing a friend after a long absence; well raised, virtuous, devoted to her husband: a wife like this is called a wife and a friend.

"One who remains patient and calm, when threatened with violence by the rod, ${ }^{1599}$ who tolerates her husband with a mind free of hate, patient, submissive to her husband's will: a wife like this is called a wife and a slave.

"The types of wives here called a killer, a thief, and a tyrant, immoral, harsh, disrespectful, with the body's breakup go to hell.
"But the types of wives here called mother, sister, friend, and slave, firm in virtue, long restrained, with the body's breakup go to heaven.

"A man, Sujātā, might have these seven kinds of wives. Now which one are you?" [94]

"Beginning today, Bhante, let the Blessed One consider me a wife who is like a slave."

64 (11) Anger ${ }^{1560}$

"Bhikkhus, there are these seven things that are gratifying and advantageous to an enemy that come upon an angry man or woman. What seven?

(1) "Here, bhikkhus, an enemy wishes for an enemy: 'May he be ugly!' For what reason? An enemy does not delight in the beauty of an enemy. When an angry person is overcome and oppressed by anger, though he may be well bathed, well anointed, with trimmed hair and beard, dressed in white clothes, still, he is ugly. This is the first thing gratifying and advantageous to an enemy that comes upon an angry man or woman.

(2) "Again, an enemy wishes for an enemy: 'May he sleep badly!' For what reason? An enemy does not delight when an enemy sleeps well. When an angry person is overcome and oppressed by anger, though he may sleep on a couch spread with rugs, blankets, and covers, with an excellent covering of antelope hide, with a canopy and red bolsters at both ends, still, he sleeps badly. This is the second thing gratifying and advantageous to an enemy that comes upon an angry man or woman.

(3) "Again, an enemy wishes for an enemy: 'May he not succeed!' For what reason? An enemy does not delight in the success of an enemy. [95] When an angry person is overcome and oppressed by anger, if he gets what is harmful, he thinks: 'I have gotten what is beneficial,' and if he gets what is beneficial, he thinks: 'I have gotten what is harmful.' When, overcome by anger, he gets these things that are diametrically opposed, they lead to his harm and suffering for a long time. This is the third thing gratifying and advantageous to an enemy that comes upon an angry man or woman.

(4) "Again, an enemy wishes for an enemy: 'May he not be
wealthy!' For what reason? An enemy does not delight in the wealth of an enemy. When an angry person is overcome and oppressed by anger, kings appropriate for the royal treasury any wealth he has acquired by energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained. This is the fourth thing gratifying and advantageous to an enemy that comes upon an angry man or woman.

(5) "Again, an enemy wishes for an enemy: 'May he not be famous!' For what reason? An enemy does not delight in the fame of an enemy. When an angry person is overcome and oppressed by anger, he loses whatever fame he had acquired through heedfulness. This is the fifth thing gratifying and advantageous to an enemy that comes upon an angry man or woman.

(6) "Again, an enemy wishes for an enemy: 'May he have no friends!' For what reason? An enemy does not delight in an enemy having friends. When an angry person is overcome and oppressed by anger, his friends and companions, relatives and family members, avoid him from afar. This is the sixth thing gratifying and advantageous to an enemy that comes upon an angry man or woman. [96]

(7) "Again, an enemy wishes for an enemy: 'With the breakup of the body, after death, may he be reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell!' For what reason? An enemy does not delight in an enemy's going to a good destination. When an angry person is overcome and oppressed by anger, he engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. As a consequence, still overcome by anger, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. This is the seventh thing gratifying and advantageous to an enemy that comes upon an angry man or woman.

[^0]

[^0]:    "These are the seven things gratifying and advantageous to an enemy that come upon an angry man or woman."

    The angry person is ugly;

    he also sleeps badly;

    having gained some benefit,

    he takes it to be harmful. ${ }^{1561}$

The angry person, overcome by anger, having slain by body and speech, ${ }^{1562}$ incurs the loss of wealth.

Maddened by anger he acquires a bad reputation. His relatives, friends, and loved ones avoid the angry person.

Anger is a cause of harm; anger stirs up mental turmoil. People do not recognize the peril that has arisen from within.

The angry person doesn't know the good; the angry person doesn't see the Dhamma. There is just blindness and dense gloom when anger overcomes a person. [97]

When an angry person causes damage, whether easily or with difficulty, later, when the anger has vanished, he is tormented as if burnt by fire.

He shows recalcitrance as a fire does a smoky crest.

When his anger spreads outward, people become angry on his account. ${ }^{1563}$

He has no shame or fear of wrong, his speech is not respectful; one overcome by anger has no island [of safety] at all.

I will tell you about the deeds that produce torment.

Listen to them as they are, ${ }^{1564}$

remote from those that are righteous:

An angry person slays his father; an angry person slays his own mother; an angry person slays a brahmin; ${ }^{1565}$ an angry person slays a worldling.

The angry worldling slays his mother, the good woman who gave him life, the one by whom he was nurtured and who showed him this world.

Those beings, like oneself, each hold their self most dear; yet those who are angry kill themselves in various ways ${ }^{1566}$ when they are distraught about diverse matters.

Some kill themselves with a sword; some who are distraught swallow poison; some hang themselves with a rope; some [jump] into a mountain gorge. [98]

Deeds that involve destroying growth ${ }^{1567}$ and deeds that cause their own death: when doing such deeds they do not know that defeat is born of anger.

Thus death's snare hidden in the heart has taken the form of anger.

One should cut it off by self-control, wisdom, energy, and [right] view.

The wise person should eradicate this one unwholesome [quality]. ${ }^{1568}$

In such a way one should train in the Dhamma: do not yield to recalcitrance.

Free from anger, their misery gone, free from delusion, ${ }^{1569}$ no longer avid, tamed, having abandoned anger, the taintless ones attain nibbāna. ${ }^{1570}$ [99]

# II. The Great Chapter

65 (1) Moral Shame ${ }^{1571}$

"Bhikkhus, (1) when there is no sense of moral shame and moral dread, for one deficient in a sense of moral shame and moral dread, (2) restraint of the sense faculties lacks its proximate cause. When there is no restraint of the sense faculties, for one deficient in restraint of the sense faculties, (3) virtuous behavior lacks its proximate cause. When there is no virtuous behavior, for one deficient in virtuous behavior, (4) right concentration lacks its proximate cause. When there is no right concentration, for one deficient in right concentration, (5) the knowledge and vision of things as they really are lacks its proximate cause. When there is no knowledge and vision of things as they really are, for one deficient in the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, (6) disenchantment and dispassion lack their proximate cause. When there is no disenchantment and dispassion, for one deficient in disenchantment and dispassion, (7) the knowledge and vision of liberation lacks its proximate cause.

"Suppose there is a tree deficient in branches and foliage. Then its shoots do not grow to fullness; also its bark, softwood, and heartwood do not grow to fullness. So too, when there is no sense of moral shame and moral dread, for one deficient in a sense of moral shame and moral dread, restraint of the sense faculties lacks its proximate cause. When there is no restraint of the sense faculties . . . the knowledge and vision of liberation lacks its proximate cause.

"Bhikkhus, (1) when there is a sense of moral shame and moral dread, for one possessing a sense of moral shame and moral dread, (2) restraint of the sense faculties possesses its proximate cause. When there is restraint of the sense faculties, for one who exercises restraint of the sense faculties, (3) virtuous behavior possesses its proximate cause. When there is virtuous behavior, for one whose behavior is virtuous, (4) right concentration possesses its proximate cause. When there is right concentration, for one possessing right concentration, (5) the knowledge and vision of things as they really are possesses its proximate cause. When there is the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, for one possessing the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, (6) disenchantment and
dispassion possess their proximate cause. When there is disenchantment and dispassion, for one possessing disenchantment and dispassion, (7) the knowledge and vision of liberation possesses its proximate cause.

"Suppose there is a tree possessing branches and foliage. Then its shoots grow to fullness; also its bark, softwood, and heartwood grow to fullness. So too, when there is a sense of moral shame and moral dread, for one possessing a sense of moral shame and moral dread, restraint of the sense faculties possesses its proximate cause. When there is restraint of the sense faculties ... the knowledge and vision of liberation possesses its proximate cause." [100]

# 66 (2) Seven Suns

On one occasion ${ }^{1572}$ the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in Ambapālī's Grove. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, conditioned phenomena are impermanent; conditioned phenomena are unstable; conditioned phenomena are unreliable. It is enough to become disenchanted with all conditioned phenomena, enough to become dispassionate toward them, enough to be liberated from them.

"Bhikkhus, Sineru, the king of mountains, is 84,000 yojanas in length and 84,000 yojanas in width; it is submerged 84,000 yojanas in the great ocean and rises up 84,000 yojanas above the great ocean. ${ }^{1573}$

(1) "There comes a time, bhikkhus, when rain does not fall for many years, for many hundreds of years, for many thousands of years, for many hundreds of thousands of years. When rain does not fall, seed life and vegetation, medicinal plants, grasses, and giant trees of the forest wither and dry up and no longer exist. So impermanent are conditioned phenomena, so unstable, so unreliable. It is enough to become disenchanted with all conditioned phenomena, enough to become dispassionate toward them, enough to be liberated from them.

(2) "There comes a time when, after a long time, a second sun appears. With the appearance of the second sun, the small rivers and lakes dry up and evaporate and no longer [101] exist.

So impermanent are conditioned phenomena. . . It is enough to be liberated from them.

(3) "There comes a time when, after a long time, a third sun appears. With the appearance of the third sun, the great rivers the Ganges, the Yamunā, the Aciravatī, the Sarabhū, and the Mahī-dry up and evaporate and no longer exist. So impermanent are conditioned phenomena. . . It is enough to be liberated from them.

(4) "There comes a time when, after a long time, a fourth sun appears. With the appearance of the fourth sun, the great lakes from which those great rivers originate-Anotatta, Sihapapāta, Rathakāra, Kaṇṇamuṇ̣a, Kuṇāla, Chaddanta, and Mandākinī-dry up and evaporate and no longer exist. So impermanent are conditioned phenomena.... It is enough to be liberated from them.

(5) "There comes a time when, after a long time, a fifth sun appears. With the appearance of the fifth sun, the waters in the great ocean sink by a hundred yojanas, two hundred yojanas... three hundred yojanas...seven hundred yojanas. The water left in the great ocean stands at the height of seven palm trees, at the height of six palm trees... five palm trees... four palm trees... three palm trees...two palm trees [102]... a mere palm tree. The water left in the great ocean stands at the height of seven fathoms...six fathoms... five fathoms... four fathoms... three fathoms... two fathoms... a fathom... half a fathom... up to the waist . . . up to the knees . . . up to the ankles. Just as, in the autumn, when thick drops of rain are pouring down, the waters stand in the hoof prints of cattle here and there, so the waters left in the great ocean will stand here and there [in pools] the size of the hoof prints of cattle. With the appearance of the fifth sun, the water left in the great ocean is not enough even to reach the joints of one's fingers. So impermanent are conditioned phenomena. . . It is enough to be liberated from them.

(6) "There comes a time when, after a long time, a sixth sun appears. With the appearance of the sixth sun, this great earth and Sineru, the king of mountains, smoke, fume, and smolder. Just as a potter's fire, when kindled, first smokes, fumes, and smolders, so with the appearance of the sixth sun, this great earth and Sineru, the king of mountains, smoke, fume, and
smolder. So impermanent are conditioned phenomena.... It is enough to be liberated from them.

(7) "There comes a time when, after a long time; a seventh sun appears. [103] With the appearance of the seventh sun, this great earth and Sineru, the king of mountains, burst into flames, blaze up brightly, and become one mass of flame. As the great earth and Sineru are blazing and burning, the flame, cast up by the wind, rises even to the brahmā world. As Sineru is blazing and burning, as it is undergoing destruction and being overcome by a great mass of heat, mountain peaks of a hundred yojanas disintegrate; mountain peaks of two hundred yojanas . . . three hundred yojanas . . . four hundred yojanas . . . five hundred yojanas disintegrate.

"When this great earth and Sineru, the king of mountains, are blazing and burning, neither ashes nor soot are seen. Just as, when ghee or oil are blazing and burning, neither ashes nor soot are seen, so it is when this great earth and Sineru, the king of mountains, are blazing and burning. So impermanent are conditioned phenomena, so unstable, so unreliable. It is enough to become disenchanted with all conditioned phenomena, enough to become dispassionate toward them, enough to be liberated from them.

"Bhikkhus, who except those who have seen the truth ${ }^{1574}$ would think or believe: ${ }^{1575}$ 'This great earth and Sineru, the king of mountains, will burn up, be destroyed, and will no longer exist'?

"In the past, bhikkhus, there was a teacher named Sunetta, the founder of a spiritual sect, one without lust for sensual pleasures. ${ }^{1576}$ The teacher Sunetta [104] had many hundreds of disciples to whom he taught a Dhamma for companionship with the brahmā world. When he was teaching, those who understood his teaching completely were, with the breakup of the body, after death, reborn in a good destination, in the brahmā world. But of those who did not understand his teaching completely, some were reborn in companionship with the devas who control what is created by others; ${ }^{1577}$ some in companionship with the devas who delight in creation; some in companionship with the Tusita devas; some in companionship with the Yāma devas; some in companionship with the Tāvatimsa devas; some in companionship with the devas [ruled by] the four great kings.

Some were reborn in companionship with affluent khattiyas; some in companionship with affluent brahmins; some in companionship with affluent householders.

"Then, bhikkhus, it occurred to the teacher Sunetta: 'It isn't fitting that I should have exactly the same future destination as my disciples. Let me develop loving-kindness further. Then for seven years the teacher Sunetta developed a mind of lovingkindness. As a consequence, for seven eons of world-dissolution and evolution he did not come back to this world. When the world was dissolving, [105] he moved on to the [realm of] streaming radiance. When the world was evolving, he was reborn in an empty mansion of Brahmā. ${ }^{1578}$

"There he was Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the vanquisher, the unvanquished, the universal seer, the wielder of mastery. He was Sakka, ruler of the devas, thirty-six times. Many hundreds of times he was a wheel-turning monarch, a righteous king who ruled by the Dhamma, a conqueror whose rule extended to the four boundaries, one who had attained stability in his country, who possessed the seven gems. He had over a thousand sons who were heroes, vigorous, able to crush the armies of their enemies. He reigned after he had conquered this earth as far as its ocean boundaries, not by force and weapons but by the Dhamma.

"Bhikkhus, though he had such a long life span and continued on for such a long time, the teacher Sunetta was still not freed from birth, from old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish. He was not freed from suffering, I say. For what reason? Because he did not understand and penetrate four things. What four? Noble virtuous behavior, noble concentration, noble wisdom, and noble liberation.

"Noble virtuous behavior, bhikkhus, has been understood and penetrated. Noble concentration has been understood and penetrated. Noble wisdom has been understood and penetrated. Noble liberation has been understood and penetrated. Craving for existence has been cut off; the conduit to existence has been destroyed; now there is no more renewed existence." ${ }^{1579}$ [106]

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:

"Virtuous behavior, concentration, wisdom, and unsurpassed liberation:
these things the illustrious Gotama understood by himself.

"Having directly known these things, the Buddha taught the Dhamma to the bhikkhus. The Teacher, the end-maker of suffering, the One with Vision, has attained nibbāna."

# 67 (3) Simile of the Fortress

"Bhikkhus, when a king's frontier fortress is well provided with seven appurtenances of a fortress and readily gains, without trouble or difficulty, four kinds of food, it can be called a king's frontier fortress that cannot be assailed by external foes and enemies.

"What are the seven kinds of appurtenances of a fortress with which it is well provided?

(1) "Here, bhikkhus, in the king's frontier fortress the pillar has a deep base and is securely planted, immobile, unshakable. A king's frontier fortress is well provided with this first appurtenance for protecting its inhabitants and for warding off outsiders.

(2) "Again, in the king's frontier fortress the moat is dug deep and wide. A king's frontier fortress is well provided with this second appurtenance for protecting its inhabitants and for warding off outsiders. [107]

(3) "Again, in the king's frontier fortress the patrol path is high and wide. A king's frontier fortress is well provided with this third appurtenance for protecting its inhabitants and for warding off outsiders.

(4) "Again, in the king's frontier fortress many weapons are stored, both missiles and hand weapons. ${ }^{1580}$ A king's frontier fortress is well provided with this fourth appurtenance for protecting its inhabitants and for warding off outsiders.

(5) "Again, in the king's frontier fortress many kinds of troops reside, that is, elephant troops, cavalry, charioteers, archers, standard bearers, camp marshals, food servers, ugga-caste warriors, front-line commandoes, great-bull warriors, attack soldiers, shield-bearing soldiers, domestic-slave soldiers. ${ }^{1581}$ A king's frontier fortress is well provided with this fifth appurtenance for protecting its inhabitants and for warding off outsiders.

(6) "Again, in the king's frontier fortress the gatekeeper is
wise, competent, and intelligent, one who keeps out strangers and admits acquaintances. A king's frontier fortress is well provided with this sixth appurtenance for protecting its inhabitants and for warding off outsiders.

(7) "Again, in the king's frontier fortress the rampart is high and wide, covered over by a coat of plaster. A king's frontier fortress is well provided with this seventh appurtenance for protecting its inhabitants and for warding off outsiders. [108]

"It is well provided with these seven kinds of appurtenances. And what are the four kinds of food that it readily gains, without trouble or difficulty?

(1) "Here, bhikkhus, in the king's frontier fortress much grass, firewood, and water are stored up for the delight, relief, ${ }^{1582}$ and ease of its inhabitants and for warding off outsiders.

(2) "Again, in the king's frontier fortress much rice and barley are stored up for the delight, relief, and ease of its inhabitants and for warding off outsiders.

(3) "Again, in the king's frontier fortress many foodstuffssesame, green gram, and beans ${ }^{1583}$-are stored up for the delight, relief, and ease of its inhabitants and for warding off outsiders.

(4) "Again, in the king's frontier fortress many medicamentsghee, butter, oil, honey, molasses, and salt-are stored up for the delight, relief, and ease of its inhabitants and for warding off outsiders.

"These are the four foods that it readily gains, without trouble or difficulty.

"When, bhikkhus, a king's frontier fortress is well provided with these seven appurtenances of a fortress, and when it readily gains, without trouble or difficulty, these four kinds of food, it can be said that the king's frontier fortress cannot be assailed by external foes and enemies.

"So too, bhikkhus, when a noble disciple possesses seven good qualities, and [109] when he gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life, he is then called a noble disciple who cannot be assailed by Māra, who cannot be assailed by the Evil One.

"What are the seven good qualities that he possesses?

(1) "Just as, bhikkhus, the pillar in the king's frontier fortress
has a deep base and is securely planted, immobile and unshakable, for the purpose of protecting its inhabitants and for warding off outsiders, so too the noble disciple is endowed with faith. He places faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' With faith as his pillar, the noble disciple abandons the unwholesome and develops the wholesome, abandons what is blameworthy and develops what is blameless, and maintains himself in purity. He possesses this first good quality.

(2) "Just as the moat in the king's frontier fortress is dug deep and wide for the purpose of protecting its inhabitants and for warding off outsiders, so too a noble disciple has a sense of moral shame; he is ashamed of bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct; he is ashamed of acquiring bad unwholesome qualities. With a sense of moral shame as the moat, the noble disciple abandons the unwholesome and develops the wholesome, abandons what is blameworthy and develops what is blameless, and maintains himself in purity. He possesses this second good quality.

(3) "Just as the patrol path in the king's frontier fortress is high and wide for the purpose of protecting its inhabitants and for warding off outsiders, so too a noble disciple dreads wrongdoing; he dreads bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct; he dreads acquiring bad unwholesome qualities. With moral dread as the patrol path, the noble disciple abandons the unwholesome and develops [110] the wholesome, abandons what is blameworthy and develops what is blameless, and maintains himself in purity. He possesses this third good quality.

(4) "Just as many weapons, both missiles and hand weapons, are stored in the king's frontier fortress for the purpose of protecting its inhabitants and for warding off outsiders, so too a noble disciple has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and accumulates what he has learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life-such teachings as these he has learned much of, retained in mind, recited
verbally, mentally investigated, and penetrated well by view. With learning as his weaponry, the noble disciple abandons the unwholesome and develops the wholesome, abandons what is blameworthy and develops what is blameless, and maintains himself in purity. He possesses this fourth good quality.

(5) "Just as many kinds of troops reside in the king's frontier fortress, that is, elephant troops . . domestic-slave soldiers, for protecting its inhabitants and for warding off outsiders, so too a noble disciple has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities. With energy as his troops, the noble disciple abandons the unwholesome and develops the wholesome, abandons what is blameworthy and develops what is blameless, and maintains himself in purity. He possesses this fifth good quality.

(6) "Just as the gatekeeper in the king's frontier fortress is wise, competent, and intelligent, one who keeps out strangers and admits acquaintances, for protecting its inhabitants and for warding off outsiders, [111] so too a noble disciple is mindful, possessing supreme mindfulness and alertness, one who remembers and recollects what was done and said long ago. With mindfulness as his gatekeeper, the noble disciple abandons the unwholesome and develops the wholesome, abandons what is blameworthy and develops what is blameless, and maintains himself in purity. He possesses this sixth good quality.

(7) "Just as the rampart in the king's frontier fortress is high and wide, covered over by a coat of plaster, for protecting its inhabitants and for warding off outsiders, so too a noble disciple is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. With wisdom as his coat of plaster, the noble disciple abandons the unwholesome and develops the wholesome, abandons what is blameworthy and develops what is blameless, and maintains himself in purity. He possesses this seventh good quality.

"He possesses these seven good qualities. ${ }^{1584}$

"And what are the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life, which he gains at will, without trouble or difficulty?
(1) "Just as, bhikkhus, much grass, firewood, and water are stored up in the king's frontier fortress for the delight, relief, and comfort of its inhabitants and for warding off outsiders, so too, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a noble disciple enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination-for his own delight, relief, and comfort, and for entering upon nibbāna.

(2) "Just as [112] much rice and barley are stored up in the king's frontier fortress for the delight, relief, and comfort of its inhabitants and for warding off outsiders, so too, with the subsiding of thought and examination, a noble disciple enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration, without thought and examination-for his own delight, relief, and comfort, and for entering upon nibbāna.

(3) "Just as many foodstuffs-sesame, green gram, and beans-are stored up in the king's frontier fortress for the delight, relief, and comfort of its inhabitants and for warding off outsiders, so too, with the fading away as well of rapture, a noble disciple dwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, he experiences pleasure with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: 'He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily'-for his own delight, relief, and comfort, and for entering upon nibbāna.

(4) "Just as many medicaments-ghee, butter, oil, honey, molasses, and salt-are stored up in the king's frontier fortress for the delight, relief, and comfort of its inhabitants and for warding off outsiders, so too, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, a noble disciple enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity-for his own delight, relief, and comfort, and for entering upon nibbāna.

"These are the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life, which he gains at will, without trouble or difficulty. [113]

"When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple possesses these seven good qualities, and when he gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, these four jhānas that constitute the higher mind
and are pleasant dwellings in this very life, he is then called a noble disciple who cannot be assailed by Māra, who cannot be assailed by the Evil One."

# 68 (4) One Who Knows the Dhamma

"Bhikkhus, possessing seven qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What seven? Here, a bhikkhu is one who knows the Dhamma, who knows the meaning, who knows himself, who knows moderation, who knows the proper time, who knows the assembly, and who knows the superior and inferior kinds of persons.

(1) "And how is a bhikkhu one who knows the Dhamma? Here, a bhikkhu knows the Dhamma: the discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, marvelous accounts, and questions-and-answers. If a bhikkhu did not know the Dhamma-the discourses . . . questions-and-answers-he would not be called 'one who knows the Dhamma.' But because he knows the Dhamma-the discourses... questions-and-answers-he is called 'one who knows the Dhamma.' Thus he is one who knows the Dhamma.

(2) "And how is a bhikkhu one who knows the meaning? Here, a bhikkhu knows the meaning of this and that statement thus: 'This is the meaning of this statement; this is the meaning of that statement.' If a bhikkhu did not know the meaning of this and that statement thus ... he would not be called 'one who knows the meaning.' But because he knows the meaning of this and that statement thus: 'This is the meaning of this statement; [114] this is the meaning of that statement,' he is called 'one who knows the meaning.' Thus he is one who knows the Dhamma and one who knows the meaning.

(3) "And how is a bhikkhu one who knows himself? Here, a bhikkhu knows himself thus: 'I have so much faith, virtuous behavior, learning, generosity, wisdom, and discernment.' If a bhikkhu did not know himself thus: 'I have so much faith . . . and discernment,' he would not be called 'one who knows himself.' But because he knows himself thus: 'I have so much faith . . . and discernment,' he is called 'one who knows himself.' Thus he is one who knows the Dhamma, one who knows the meaning, and one who knows himself.
(4) "And how is a bhikkhu one who knows moderation? Here, a bhikkhu knows moderation in accepting robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick. If a bhikkhu did not know moderation in accepting robes... and provisions for the sick, he would not be called 'one who knows moderation.' But because he knows moderation in accepting robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick, he is called 'one who knows moderation.' Thus he is one who knows the Dhamma, one who knows the meaning, one who knows himself, and one who knows moderation.

(5) "And how is a bhikkhu one who knows the proper time? Here, a bhikkhu knows the proper time thus: 'This is the time for learning, this is the time for questioning, this is the time for exertion, this is the time for seclusion.' If a bhikkhu did not know the proper time-'This is the time for learning ... this is the time for seclusion'-he would not be called 'one who knows: the proper time.' But because he knows the proper time-'This is the time for learning ... this is the time for seclusion'-he is called 'one who knows the proper time.' Thus he is one who knows the Dhamma, one who knows the meaning, one who knows himself; one who knows moderation, and one who knows the proper time.

(6) "And how is a bhikkhu one who knows the assembly? Here, a bhikkhu knows the assembly: 'This is an assembly of khattiyas, this is an assembly of brahmins, this is an assembly of householders, this is an assembly of ascetics. Among these, one should approach [this assembly] in such a way; [115] one should stop in such a way; one should act in such a way; one should sit down in such a way; one should speak in such a way; one should remain silent in such a way.' If a bhikkhu did not know the assembly: 'This is an assembly of khattiyas . . . of ascetics. Among these, one should approach [this assembly] in such a way ... one should remain silent in such a way'-he would not be called 'one who knows the assembly.' But because he knows the assembly-'This is an assembly of khattiyas . . . of ascetics. Among these, one should approach [this assembly] in such a way ... one should remain silent in such a way'-he is called 'one who knows the assembly.' Thus he is one who knows the Dhamma, one who knows the meaning, one who knows himself, one who knows moderation, one who knows the proper time, and one who knows the assembly.
(7) "And how is a bhikkhu one who knows the superior and inferior kinds of persons? Here, a bhikkhu understands persons in terms of pairs. ${ }^{1585}$

(i) "Two persons: one wants to see the noble ones; one does not want to see the noble ones. The person who does not want to see the noble ones is in that respect blameworthy; the person who wants to see the noble ones is in that respect praiseworthy.

(ii) "Two persons who want to see the noble ones: one wants to hear the good Dhamma; one does not want to hear the good Dhamma. The person who does not want to hear the good Dhamma is in that respect blameworthy; the person who wants to hear the good Dhamma is in that respect praiseworthy.

(iii) "Two persons who want to hear the good Dhamma: one listens to the Dhamma with eager ears; one does not listen to the Dhamma with eager ears. The person who does not listen to the Dhamma with eager ears is in that respect blameworthy; the person [1:16] who listens to the Dhamma with eager ears is in that respect praiseworthy.

(iv) "Two persons who listen to the Dhamma with eager ears: one, having heard the Dhamma, retains it in mind; one, having heard the Dhamma, does not retain it in mind. The person who, having heard the Dhamma, does not retain it in mind is in that respect blameworthy; the person who, having heard the Dhamma, retains it in mind is in that respect praiseworthy.

(v) "Two persons who, having heard the Dhamma, retain it in mind: one examines the meaning of the teachings that have been retained in mind; one does not examine the meaning of the teachings that have been retained in mind. The person who does not examine the meaning of the teachings that have been retained in mind is in that respect blameworthy; the person who examines the meaning of the teachings that have been retained in mind is in that respect praiseworthy.

(vi) "Two persons who examine the meaning of the teachings that have been retained in mind: one has understood the meaning and the Dhamma and then practices in accordance with the Dhamma; one has not understood the meaning and the Dhamma and does not practice in accordance with the Dhamma. The person who has not understood the meaning and the Dhamma and does not practice in accordance with the Dhamma is in that respect blameworthy; the person who has understood the meaning and the Dhamma and then
practices in accordance with the Dhamma is in that respect praiseworthy.

(vii) "Two persons who have understood the meaning and the Dhamma and then practice in accordance with the Dhamma: one is practicing for his own welfare but not for the welfare of others; one is practicing for his own welfare and for the welfare of others. The person who is practicing for his own welfare but not for the welfare of others is in that respect blameworthy; the person who is practicing for his own welfare and for the welfare of others is in that respect praiseworthy.

"It is in this way that a bhikkhu understands persons in terms of pairs. It is in this way that a bhikkhu is one who knows the superior and inferior kinds of persons. [117]

"Possessing these seven qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

# 69 (5) Pāricchattaka

(1) "Bhikkhus, when the foliage of the Tāvatimsa devas' pāricchattaka coral tree has turned yellow, ${ }^{1586}$ the Tāvatimsa devas are elated, [thinking]: 'The foliage of the päricchattaka coral tree now has turned yellow. Now it won't be long before its foliage will fall.'

(2) "When the foliage of the Tāvatimsa devas' pāricchattaka coral tree has fallen, the Tāvatimsa devas are elated, [thinking]: 'The foliage of the päricchattaka coral tree now has fallen. Now it won't be long before its floral initiation occurs. ${ }^{1587}$

(3) "When the Tāvatimsa devas' päricchattaka coral tree has had its floral initiation, the Tāvatimsa devas are elated, [thinking]: 'The päricchattaka coral tree now has had its floral initiation. Now it won't be long before its floral differentiation occurs. ${ }^{1588}$

(4) "When the Tāvatimsa devas' päricchattaka coral tree has had its floral differentiation, the Tāvatimsa devas are elated, [thinking]: 'The päricchattaka coral tree now has had its floral differentiation. Now it won't be long before its bud formation occurs. ${ }^{1599}$

(5) "When the Tāvatimsa devas' päricchattaka coral tree has had its bud formation, the Tāvatimsa devas are elated, [thinking]: 'The päricchattaka coral tree now has had its bud formation. Now it won't be long before [118] its bud burst occurs. ${ }^{1590}$
(6) "When the Tāvatimsa devas' pāricchattaka coral tree has had its bud burst, the Tāvatimsa devas are elated, [thinking]: 'The päricchattaka coral tree now has had its bud burst. Now it won't be long before it fully blossoms. ${ }^{1591}$

(7) "When the Tāvatimsa devas' päricchattaka coral tree has fully blossomed, the Tāvatimsa devas are elated, and they spend four celestial months at the foot of the päricchattaka coral tree enjoying themselves furnished and endowed with the five objects of sensual pleasure. When the päricchattaka coral tree has fully blossomed, a radiance suffuses the area fifty yojanas all around and a fragrance is carried along with the wind for a hundred yojanas. This is the majesty of the päricchattaka coral tree.

(1) "So too, bhikkhus, when a noble disciple intends to go forth from the household life into homelessness, on that occasion he is one whose foliage has turned yellow, like the Tāvatimsa devas' päricchattaka coral tree. ${ }^{1592}$

(2) "When a noble disciple has shaved off his hair and beard, put on ochre robes, and gone forth from the household life into homelessness, on that occasion he is one whose foliage has fallen, like the Tāvatimsa devas' päricchattaka coral tree.

(3) "When, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a noble disciple enters and dwells in the first jhāna . . on that occasion his floral initiation has occurred, like the Tāvatimsa devas' päricchattaka coral tree.

(4) "When, with the subsiding of thought and examination, a noble disciple enters and dwells in the second jhāna... on that occasion his floral differentiation has occurred, like the Tāvatimsa devas' päricchattaka coral tree.

(5) "When, [119] with the fading away as well of rapture, a noble disciple . . . enters and dwells in the third jhāna . . . on that occasion his bud formation has occurred, like the Tāvatimsa devas' päricchattaka coral tree.

(6) "When, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, a noble disciple enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna... on that occasion his buds have burst open, like the Tāvatimsa devas' päricchattaka coral tree.

(7) "When, with the destruction of the taints, a noble disciple has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and hav-
ing entered upon it, dwells in it, on that occasion he has fully blossomed, like the Tāvatimsa devas' päricchattaka coral tree.

"On that occasion, bhikkhus, the earth-dwelling devas raise a cry: 'This Venerable So-and-So, the pupil of that Venerable One, went forth from the household life into homelessness from such and such a village or town, and now, with the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwèlls in it.' Having heard the cry of the earth-dwelling devas, the devas [ruled by] the four great kings raise a cry.... Having heard the cry of the devas [ruled by] the four great kings, the Tāvatimsa devas . . . the Yāma devas . . . the Tusita devas . . . the devas who delight in creation... the devas who control what is created by others... the devas of Brahmā's company raise a cry: 'This Venerable So-and-So . . . has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it.' Thus [120] at that moment, at that instant, at that second, the cry spreads as far as the brahma world. ${ }^{1593}$ This is the spiritual majesty of a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed."

# 70 (6) Honor

Then, when the Venerable Sāriputta was alone in seclusion, the following course of thought arose in his mind: "What should a bhikkhu honor, respect, and dwell in dependence on so that he might abandon the unwholesome and develop the wholesome?"

It then occurred to him: "(1) A bhikkhu should honor, respect, and dwell in dependence on the Teacher so that he might abandon the unwholesome and develop the wholesome. (2) He should honor, respect, and dwell in dependence on the Dhamma . . (3) . . . the Sangha . . (4) . . . the training . . (5) . . concentration . . (6) . . . heedfulness . . (7) . . . hospitality so that he might abandon the unwholesome and develop the wholesome."

Then it occurred to the Venerable Sāriputta: "These qualities have been purified and cleansed in me. Let me go to the Blessed One and report them to him. Thus these qualities will be purified in me and will be more widely known as purified. ${ }^{1594}$

Suppose a man would find a gold nugget, purified and cleansed. It might occur to him: 'This golden nugget of mine is purified and cleansed. Let me go and show it to the goldsmiths. Then, when this golden nugget of mine has been shown to the goldsmiths, it will be purified and will be more widely known as purified.' So too these qualities have been purified and cleansed in me. Let me go to the Blessed One and report them to him. Thus these qualities will be purified in me and will be more widely known as purified."

Then, [121] in the evening, the Venerable Sāriputta emerged from seclusion and approached the Blessed One. He paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side, and said:

"Here, Bhantè, when I was alone in seclusion, the following course of thought arose in my mind ... [He here relates the entire course of thought stated above, down to:] ...Thus these qualities will be purified in me [122] and will be more widely known as purified."

"Good, good, Sāriputta! A bhikkhu should honor, respect, and dwell in dependence on the Teacher so that he might abandon the unwholesome and develop the wholesome. He should honor, respect, and dwell in dependence on the Dhamma . . . the Sangha... the training . . . concentration . . . heedfulness . . . hospitality so that he might abandon the unwholesome and develop the wholesome."

When this was said, the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, I understand in detail thus the meaning of this statement that the Blessed One has spoken in brief.

"It is impossible, Bhante, that a bhikkhu who lacks reverence for the Teacher could have reverence for the Dhamma. The bhikkhu who (1) lacks reverence for the Teacher (2) also lacks reverence for the Dhamma.

"It is impossible, Bhante, that a bhikkhu who lacks reverence for the Teacher and the Dhamma could have reverence for the Sangha. The bhikkhu who lacks reverence for the Teacher and the Dhamma (3) also lacks reverence for the Sangha.

"It is impossible, Bhante, that a bhikkhu who lacks reverence for the Teacher, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, the training, concentration, and heedfulness could have reverence for hospitality. The bhikkhu who lacks reverence for the Teacher, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, the training, concentration, and heedfulness (7) also lacks reverence for hospitality.

"It is in such a way, Bhante, that I understand in detail the meaning of this statement that the Blessed One has spoken in brief."

"Good, good, Sāriputta! It is good that you understand in detail the meaning of this statement that I have spoken in brief in such a way. Indeed, Sāriputta, it is impossible that a bhikkhu who lacks reverence for the Teacher could have reverence for the Dhamma.... [The Buddha here repeats the entire elaboration by Sāriputta.] [125]... The bhikkhu who has reverence for the Teacher, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, the training, concentration, and heedfulness also has reverence for hospitality.

"It is in such a way, Sāriputta, that the meaning of this statement that I spoke in brief should be understood in detail."

# 71 (7) Development ${ }^{1595}$

"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is not intent on development, even though he forms the wish: 'May my mind be liberated from the taints by non-clinging!' yet his mind is not liberated from the taints by non-clinging. For what reason? Because he lacks development. Lacks development of what? (1) Of the four establishments of mindfulness, (2) the four right strivings, (3) the four bases for psychic potency, (4) the five spiritual faculties, (5) the five powers, (6) the seven factors of enlightenment, and (7) the noble eightfold path.

"Suppose there was a hen with eight, ten, or twelve eggs that she had not properly covered, incubated, and nurtured. [126] Even though she might form the wish: 'May my chicks pierce their shells with the points of their claws or beaks and hatch safely!' yet the chicks are incapable of doing so. For what reason? Because the hen had not properly covered, incubated, and nurtured her eggs.

"So too, when a bhikkhu is not intent on development, even though he forms the wish: 'May my mind be liberated from the taints by non-clinging!' yet his mind is not liberated from the taints by non-clinging. For what reason? Because he lacks
development. Lacks development of what? Of the four establishments of mindfulness . . . the noble eightfold path.

"When, bhikkhus, a carpenter or a carpenter's apprentice sees the impressions of his fingers and his thumb on the handle of his adze, he does not know: 'I have worn away so much of the adze handle today, so much yesterday, so much earlier'; but when it has worn away, he knows that it has worn away. So too, when a bhikkhu is intent on development, even though he does not know: 'I have worn away so much of the taints today, so much yesterday, so much earlier,' yet when they are worn away, he knows that they are worn away.

"Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a seafaring shipbound together by lashings that had been worn away in the water for six months. It would be hauled up on dry land during the cold season and its lashings would be further attacked by wind and sun. Inundated by rain from a rain cloud, the lashings would readily deteriorate and rot away. So too, when a bhikkhu is intent on development, his fetters readily collapse and rot away." [128]

72 (8) Fire

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was walking on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Sangha of bhikkhus. Then, while traveling along the highway, in a certain spot the Blessed One saw a great mass of fire burning, blazing, and glowing. He left the highway, sat down on the seat prepared for him at the foot of a tree, and addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, do you see that great mass of fire burning, blazing, and glowing?"

"Yes, Bhante."

(1) "What do you think, bhikkhus? Which is better, to embrace that great mass of fire, burning, blazing, and glowing, and sit down or lie down next to it, or to embrace a girl with soft and tender hands and feet-whether from a khattiya, brahmin, or householder clan-and sit down or lie down next to her?"

"It would be far better, Bhante, to embrace a girl with soft and tender hands and feet-whether from a khattiya, brahmin, or householder clan-and sit down or lie down next to her. It would be painful to embrace that great mass of fire, burning, blazing, and glowing, and sit down or lie down next to it."

"I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you that for an immoral man of bad character-one of impure and suspect behavior, secretive in his actions, not an ascetic though claiming to be one, not a celibate though claiming to be one, inwardly rotten, corrupt, depraved-it would be far better to embrace that great mass of fire, burning, blazing, and glowing, and sit down or lie down next to it. For what reason? Because on that account [129] he might undergo death or deadly pain, but for that reason he would not, with the breakup of the body, after death, be reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. But when that immoral man . . . embraces a girl with soft and tender hands and feet-whether from a khattiya, brahmin, or householder clan-and sits down or lies down next to her, this leads to his harm and suffering for a long time. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.

"It would be far better, Bhante, for one to accept the homage of affluent khattiyas, brahmins, or householders.

For what reason? Because on that account he might undergo death or deadly pain, but for that reason he would not, with the breakup of the body, after death, be reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.

With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.

(3) "What do you think, bhikkhus? Which is better, for a strong man to strike one in the breast with a sharp spear smeared with oil, or for one to accept reverential salutations from affluent khattiyas, brahmins, or householders?"

"It would be far better, Bhante, for one to accept reverential salutations from affluent khattiyas, brahmins, or householders. It would be painful if a strong man were to strike one in the breast with a sharp spear smeared with oil."

(4) "What do you think, bhikkhus? Which is better, for a strong man to wrap a hot iron sheet-burning, [131] blazing, and glowing-around one's body, or for one to use a robe given out of faith by affluent khattiyas, brahmins, or householders?"

(6) "What do you think, bhikkhus? Which is better, for a strong man to grab one by the head or shoulders [133] and force one to sit or lie down on a hot iron bed or chair-burning, blazing, and glowing-or for one to use a bed and chair given out of faith by affluent khattiyas, brahmins, or householders?"

(7) "What do you think, bhikkhus? Which is better, for a strong man to grab one, turn one upside down, and throw one into a hot copper cauldron-burning, blazing, and glowingand while one is boiling there in a swirl of froth, one sometimes rises, sometimes sinks, and sometimes is swept across, or for one to use a dwelling given out of faith by affluent khattiyas, [134] brahmins, or householders?"

"It would be far better, Bhante, for one to use a dwelling

"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'When we use robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick, these services that [others] provide for us will be of great fruit and benefit to them, and this going forth of ours will not be barren, but fruitful and fertile.' Thus should you train yourselves. Considering your own good, bhikkhus, it is enough to strive for the goal with heedfulness; considering the good of others, [135] it is enough to strive for the goal with heedfulness; considering the good of both, it is enough to strive for the goal with heedfulness."1597

This is what the Blessed One said. Now while this exposition was being spoken, sixty bhikkhus vomited hot blood. Sixty bhikkhus gave up the training and returned to the lower life, "saying: "It is difficult to do, Blessed One, very difficult to do." And the minds of sixty bhikkhus were liberated from the taints by non-clinging. ${ }^{1598}$

73 (9) Sunetta

(1) "Bhikkhus, in the past there was a teacher named Sunetta, the founder of a spiritual sect, one without lust for sensual pleasures. ${ }^{1599}$ The teacher Sunetta had many hundreds of disciples to whom he taught a Dhamma for companionship with the brahmā world. When he was teaching such a Dhamma, those who did not place confidence in him were, with the breakup of the body, after death, reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; but those who placed confidence in him were reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.

"In the past, bhikkhus, (2) there was a teacher named Mūgapakkha... (3) there was a teacher named Aranemi... (4) there was a teacher named Kuddāla... (5) there was a teacher named Hatthipāla... (6) there was a teacher named Jotipāla... (7) there was a teacher named Araka, the founder of a spiritual sect, one without lust for sensual pleasures. The teacher Araka had many hundreds of disciples to whom he taught a Dhamma for companionship with the brahmā world. When he [136] was teaching such a Dhamma, those who did not place confidence in him were, with the breakup of the body, after death, reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; but those who placed confidence in him were reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.

"What do you think, bhikkhus? These seven teachers were founders of spiritual sects, men without lust for sensual pleasures who had retinues of many hundreds of disciples. If, with a mind of hatred, one had insulted and reviled them and their communities of disciples, wouldn't one have generated much demerit?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"If, with a mind of hatred, one had insulted and reviled these six teachers together with their communities of disciples, one would have generated much demerit. But if, with a mind of hatred, one reviles and abuses a single person accomplished in view, one generates even more demerit. For what reason? I say, bhikkhus, there is no injury against outsiders like that against [your] fellow monks. ${ }^{1600}$ Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will not let hatred toward our fellow monks arise in our minds.' Thus, bhikkhus, should you train yourselves."

74 (10) Araka

"Bhikkhus, in the past there was a teacher named Araka, the founder of a spiritual sect, one without lust for sensual pleasures. The teacher Araka had many hundreds of disciples to whom he taught such a Dhamma as this: 'Brahmins, short is the life of human beings, limited and fleeting; it has much suffering, much misery. One should wisely understand this. [137] One should do what is wholesome and lead the spiritual life; for none who are born can escape death.

(1) "'Just as a drop of dew on the tip of a blade of grass will quickly vanish at sunrise and will not last lorig, so too, brahmins, human life is like a drop of dew. It is limited and fleeting; it has much suffering, much misery. One should wisely understand this. One should do what is wholesome and lead the spiritual life; for none who are born can escape death.

(2) "'Just as, when thick drops of rain are pouring down, a water bubble will quickly vanish and will not last long, so too, brahmins, human life is like a water bubble. It is limited . . . for none who are born can escape death.

(3) "Just as a line drawn on water with a stick will quickly vanish and will not last long, so too, brahmins, human life is like a line drawn on water with a stick. It is limited . . . for none who are born can escape death.

(4) "'Just as a river flowing down from a mountain, going a long distance, with a swift current, carrying along much flotsam, will not stand still for a moment, an instant, a second, but will rush on, swirl, and flow forward, so too, brahmins, human life is like a mountain stream. It is limited ... for none who are born can escape death.

(5) "'Just as a strong man might form a lump of spittle at the tip of his tongue and spit it out without difficulty, so too, brahmins, human life is like a lump of spittle. It is limited . . . for none who are born can escape death.

(6) "'Just as [138] a piece of meat thrown into an iron pan heated all day will quickly vanish and will not last long, so too, brahmins, human life is like this piece of meat. It is limited . . . for none who are born can escape death.

(7) "'Just as, when a cow to be slaughtered is being led to the slaughterhouse, whatever leg she lifts, she is close to slaughter, close to death, so too, brahmins, human life is like a cow doomed to slaughter. It is limited and fleeting; it has much
suffering, much misery. One should wisely understand this. One should do what is wholesome and lead the spiritual life; for none who are born can escape death.'

"But at that time, bhikkhus, the human life span was 60,000 years, and girls were marriageable at the age of five hundred. At that time, people had but six afflictions: cold, heat, hunger, thirst, excrement, and urine. Though people had such long life spans and lived so long, and though their afflictions were so few, still, the teacher Araka gave his disciples such a teaching: 'Brahmins, short is the life of human beings . . . for none who are born can escape death.'

"But nowadays, bhikkhus, one could rightly say: 'Short is the life of human beings, limited and fleeting; it has much suffering, much misery. One should wisely understand this. One should do what is wholesome and lead the spiritual life; for none who are born can escape death.' For today one who lives long lives for a hundred years or a little more. And when living for a hundred years, one lives just for three hundred seasons: a hundred winters, a hundred summers, and a hundred. rains. When living for three hundred seasons, one lives just for twelve hundred months: four hundred [139] winter months, four hundred summer months, and four hundred months of the rains. When living for twelve hundred months, one lives just for twenty-four hundred fortnights: eight hundred fortnights of winter, eight hundred fortnights of summer, and eight hundred fortnights of the rains.

"And when living for twenty-four hundred fortnights, one lives just for 36,000 nights: 12,000 nights of winter, 12,000 nights of summer, and 12,000 nights of the rains. ${ }^{1601}$ And when living for 36,000 nights, one eats just 72,000 meals: 24,000 meals in winter, 24,000 in summer, and 24,000 in the rains. And this includes the taking of mother's milk and the [times when there are] obstacles to meals. These are the obstacles to meals: one who is angry ${ }^{1602}$ does not eat a meal, one in pain does not eat a meal, one who is ill does not eat a meal, one observing the uposatha does not eat a meal, and when not obtaining [food] one does not eat a meal.

"Thus, bhikkhus, for a human being with a life span of a hundred years, I have reckoned his life span, the limit of his life span, the number of seasons, years, months, and fortnights [in his life]; the number of his nights, days, ${ }^{1603}$ and meals, and
the obstacles to meals. Whatever, bhikkhus, should be done by a compassionate teacher out of compassion for his disciples, seeking their welfare, that I have done for you. These are the feet of trees, these are empty huts. Meditate, bhikkhus, do not be heedless. Do not have cause to regret it later. This is our instruction to you." [140]

# 83 (9) The Teaching

Then the Venerable Upāli approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: "Bhante, it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that, having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One; I might dwell alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute."

"Upāli, those things which you might know thus: 'These things do not lead exclusively to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to nibbāna,' you should definitely recognize: 'This is not the Dhamma; this is not the discipline; this is not the teaching of the Teacher.' But those things which you might know thus: 'These things lead exclusively to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to nibbāna,' you should definitely recognize: 'This is the Dhamma; this is the discipline; this is the teaching of the Teacher.'"

## Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One

## The First Fifty

## I: LOVING-KINDNESS

## 1 (1) Loving-Kindness

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, when the liberation of the mind by lovingkindness has been pursued, developed, and cultivated, made a vehicle and basis, carried out, consolidated, and properly undertaken, eight benefits are to be expected. What eight?

(1) "One sleeps well; (2) one awakens happily; (3) one does not have bad dreams; (4) one is pleasing to human beings; (5) one is pleasing to spirits; ${ }^{1615}$ (6) deities protect one; (7) fire, poison, and weapons do not injure one; and (8) if one does not penetrate further, one moves on to the brahmā world.

"When, bhikkhus, the liberation of the mind by lovingkindness has been pursued, developed, and cultivated, made a vehicle and basis, carried out, consolidated, and properly undertaken, these eight benefits are to be expected."

For one who, ever mindful, develops

measureless loving-kindness,

the fetters thin out as he sees

the destruction of the acquisitions. [151]

If, with a mind free from hate, one arouses love toward just one being, one thereby becomes good.

Compassionate in mind toward all beings, ${ }^{1616}$ the noble one generates abundant merit.

Those royal sages who conquered the earth with its multitudes of beings traveled around performing sacrifices: the horse sacrifice, ${ }^{1617}$ the person sacrifice, sammāpāsa, vājapcyya, niraggala. ${ }^{1618}$

All these are not worth a sixteenth part of a well-developed loving mind, just as the hosts of stars ${ }^{1619}$ cannot match a sixteenth part of the moon's radiance.

One who does not kill or enjoin killing, who does not conquer or enjoin conquest, one who has loving-kindness toward all beings ${ }^{1620}$

harbors no enmity toward anyone.

# 2 (2) Wisdom

"Bhikkhus, there are these eight causes and conditions that lead to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life ${ }^{1621}$ when it has not been obtained and to its increase, maturation, and fulfillment by development after it has been obtained. What eight?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu lives in dependence on the Teacher or on a certain fellow monk in the position of a teacher, toward whom he has set up a keen sense of moral shame and moral dread, affection and reverence. This is the first cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life when it has not been obtained and to its increase, maturation, and fulfillment by development after it has been obtained. [152]

(2) "As he is living in dependence on the Teacher or on a certain fellow monk in the position of a teacher, toward whom he has set up a keen sense of moral shame and moral dread, affection and reverence, he approaches them from time to time
and inquires: 'How is this, Bhante? What is the meaning of this?' Those venerable ones then disclose to him what has not been disclosed, clear up what is obscure, and dispel his perplexity about numerous perplexing points. This is the second cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life....

(3) "Having heard that Dhamma, he resorts to two kinds of withdrawal: withdrawal in body and withdrawal in mind. This is the third cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life....

(4) "He is virtúous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. This is the fourth cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life....

(5) "He has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and accumulates what he has learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life-such teachings as these he has learned much of, retained in mind, recited verbally, mentally investigated, and penetrated well by view. This is the fifth cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life.... [153]

(6) "He has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities. This is the sixth cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life....

(7) "In the midst of the Sangha, he does not engage in rambling and pointless talk. Either he himself speaks on the Dhamma, or he requests someone else to do so, or he adopts noble silence. ${ }^{1622}$ This is the seventh cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life....

(8) "He dwells contemplating arising and vanishing in the five aggregates subject to clinging: 'Such is form, such its origin, such its passing away; such is feeling...such is perception...such are volitional activities...such is consciousness, such its origin, such its passing away.' This is the eighth cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental
to the spiritual life when it has not been obtained and to its increase, maturation, and fulfillment by development after it has been obtained.

(1) "His fellow monks esteem him thus: 'This venerable one lives in dependence on the Teacher or on a certain fellow monk in the position of a teacher, toward whom he has set up a keen sense of moral shame and moral dread, affection and reverence. This venerable one surely knows and sees.' This quality leads to affection, respect, esteem, accord, and unity. ${ }^{1623}$

(2) "'As this venerable one is living in dependence on the Teacher or on a certain fellow monk in the position of a teacher ... [154] . . . those venerable ones . . . dispel his perplexity about numerous perplexing points. This venerable one surely knows and sees.' This quality, too, leads to affection, respect, esteem, accord, and unity.

(3) "'Having heard that Dhamma, this venerable one resorts to two kinds of withdrawal: withdrawal in body and withdrawal in mind. This venerable one surely knows and sees.' This quality, too, leads to affection, respect, esteem, accord, and unity.

(4) "'This venerable one is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha . . . he trains in them. This venerable one surely knows and sees.' This quality, too, leads to affection, respect, esteem, accord, and unity.

(5) "'This venerable one has learned much . . . and penetrated well by view. This venerable one surely knows and sees.' This quality, too, leads to affection, respect, esteem, accord, and unity.

(6) "'This venerable one has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities... not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities. This venerable one surely knows and sees.' This quality, too, leads to affection, respect, esteem, accord, and unity. [155]

(7) "'In the midst of the Sangha, this venerable one does not engage in rambling and pointless talk... or he adopts noble silence. This venerable one surely knows and sees.' This quality, too, leads to affection, respect, esteem, accord, and unity.

(8) "'This venerable one dwells contemplating arising and vanishing in the five aggregates subject to clinging. . . This venerable one surely knows and sees.' This quality, too, leads to affection, respect, esteem, accord, and unity.
"These, bhikkhus, are the eight causes and conditions that lead to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life when it has not been obtained and to its increase, maturation, and fulfillment by development after it has been obtained."

# 3 (3) Pleasing (1) ${ }^{1624}$

"Bhikkhus, possessing eight qualities, a bhikkhu is displeasing and disagreeable to his fellow monks and is neither respected nor esteemed by them. What eight? Here, (1) a bhikkhu praises those who are displeasing and (2) criticizes those who are pleasing; (3) he is desirous of gains and (4) honor; (5) he is morally shameless and (6) morally reckless; (7) he has evil desires and (8) holds wrong view. Possessing these eight qualities, a bhikkhu is displeasing and disagreeable to his fellow monks and is neither respected nor esteemed by them.

"Bhikkhus, possessing eight qualities, a bhikkhu is pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and is respected and esteemed by them. What eight? [156] Here, (1) a bhikkhu does not praise those who are displeasing or (2) criticize those who are pleasing; (3) he is not desirous of gains or (4) honor; (5) he has a sense of moral shame and (6) moral dread; (7) he has few desires and (8) holds right view. Possessing these eight qualities, a bhikkhu is pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and is respected and esteemed by them."

## 4 (4) Pleasing (2)

"Bhikkhus, possessing eight qualities, a bhikkhu is displeasing and disagreeable to his fellow monks and is neither respected nor esteemed by them. What eight? Here, a bhikkhu is (1) desirous of gains, (2) honor, and (3) reputation; (4) he does not know the proper time and (5) does not know moderation; (6) he is impure; ${ }^{1625}$ (7) he speaks much; and (8) he insults and reviles his fellow monks. Possessing these eight qualities, a bhikkhu is displeasing and disagreeable to his fellow monks and is neither respected nor esteemed by them.

"Bhikkhus, possessing eight qualities, a bhikkhu is pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and is respected and esteemed by them. What eight? Here, a bhikkhu is (1) not desirous of gains, (2) honor, and (3) reputation; (4) he is one who knows the proper time and (5) who knows moderation; (6) he is pure; (7) he does not speak much; and (8) he does not insult and revile
his fellow monks. Possessing these eight qualities, a bhikkhu is pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and is respected and esteemed by them."

5 (5) World (1)

"Bhikkhus, these eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and the world revolves around these eight worldly conditions. What eight? [157] Gain and loss, disrepute and fame, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain. These eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and the world revolves around these eight worldly conditions."

Gain and loss, disrepute and fame, blame and praise, pleasure and pain: these conditions that people meet are impermanent, transient, and subject to change.

A wise and mindful person knows them and sees that they are subject to change. Desirable conditions don't excite his mind nor is he repelled by undesirable conditions.

He has dispelled attraction and repulsion; they are gone and no longer present.

Having known the dustless, sorrowless state, he understands rightly and has transcended existence.

6 (6) World (2)

"Bhikkhus, these eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and the world revolves around these eight worldly conditions. What eight? Gain and loss, disrepute and fame, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain. These eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and the world revolves around these eight worldly conditions.

"Bhikkhus, an uninstructed worldling meets gain and loss, disrepute and fame, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain. An instructed noble disciple also meets gain and loss, disrepute and fame, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain. What [158] is the distinction, the disparity, the difference between an instructed noble disciple and an uninstructed worldling with regard to this?"
"Bhante, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the Blessed One, take recourse in the Blessed One. It would be good if the Blessed One would clear up the meaning of this statement. Having heard it from him, the bhikkhus will retain it in mind."

"Then listen, bhikkhus, and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"(1) Bhikkhus, when an uninstructed worldling meets with gain, he does not reflect thus: 'This gain that I have met is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change.' He does not understand it as it really is. (2) When he meets with loss... (3) ... fame ...(4) ...disrepute ... (5) ...blame ... (6) ... praise ... (7) ... pleasure ... (8) ... pain, he does not reflect thus: 'This pain that I have met is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change.' He does not understand it as it really is.

"Gain obsesses his mind, and loss obsesses his mind. Fame obsesses his mind, and disrepute obsesses his mind. Blame obsesses his mind, and praise obsesses his mind. Pleasure obsesses his mind, and pain obsesses his mind. He is attracted to gain and repelled by loss. He is attracted to fame and repelled by disrepute. He is attracted to praise and repelled by blame. He is attracted to pleasure and repelled by pain. Thus involved with attraction and repulsion, he is not freed from birth, from old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish; he is not freed from suffering, I say.

"But, bhikkhus, (1) when an instructed noble disciple meets with gain, he reflects thus: 'This gain that I have met is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change.' He thus understands it as it really is. (2) When he meets with loss ... (3) ... fame ... (4) ... [159] disrepute ... (5) ...blame ... (6) ... praise ... (7) ... pleasure ... (8) ... pain, he reflects thus: 'This pain that I have met is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change.' He thusis: : 'erstands it as it really is.

"Gain does not obsess his mind, and loss does not obyess his mind. Fame does not obsess his mind, and disrepute does not obsess his mind. Blame does not obsess his mind, and praise does not obsess his mind. Pleasure does not obsess his mind, and pain does not obsess his mind. He is not attracted to gain or repelled by loss. He is not attracted to fame or repelled by disrepute. He is not attracted to praise or repelled by blame.

He is not attracted to pleasure or repelled by pain. Having thus discarded attraction and repulsion, he is freed from birth, from old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish; he is freed from suffering, I say.

"This, bhikkhus, is the distinction, the disparity, the difference between an instructed noble disciple and an uninstructed worldling."

[The verses are identical with those of 8:5.] [160]

# 7 (7) Devadatta's Failing

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak not long after Devadatta had left. ${ }^{1626}$ There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus with reference to Devadatta:

"Bhikkhus; it is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to review his own failings. It is good for him from time to time to review the failings of others. It is good for him from time to time to review his own achievements. It is good for him from time to time to review the achievements of others. Because he was overcome and obsessed by eight bad conditions, Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for an eon, unredeemable. What eight? .

"(1) Because he was overcome and obsessed by gain, Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for an eon, unredeemable. (2) Because he was overcome and obsessed by loss... (3) ... by fame . . (4) . . by disrepute ... (5) . . by honor . . (6) . . by lack of honor . . (7) . . by evil desires... (8) . . by bad friendship, Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for an eon, unredeemable. Because he was overcome and obsessed by these eight bad conditions, Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, andi he will remain there for an eon, unredeemable.

"It is good for a bhikkhu to overcome gain whenever it arises. It is good for him to overcome loss whenever it arises . . . to overcome fame . . . disrepute . . . honor [161] . . lack of honor . . evil desires ... bad friendship whenever it arises.

"And for what reason should a bhikkhu overcome gain whenever it arises? For what reason should he overcome loss... fame . . . disrepute . . . honor . . . lack of honor . . . evil
desires...bad friendship whenever it arises? Those taints, distressful and feverish, that might arise in one who has not overcome arisen gain do not occur in one who has overcome it. Those taints, distressful and feverish, that might arise in one who has not overcome arisen loss . . . arisen fame . . . arisen disrepute . . . arisen honor... arisen lack of honor . . . arisen evil desires . . . arisen bad friendship do not occur in one who has overcome it. For this reason a bhikkhu should overcome gain whenever it arises. He should overcome loss . . . fame . . . disrepute . . . honor . . . lack of honor . . . evil desires . . .bad friendship whenever it arises.

"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will overcome gain whenever it arises. We will overcome loss . . . fame . . . disrepute . . . honor . . lack of honor . . evil desires . . .bad friendship whenever it arises.' It is in such a way. that you should train yourselves." [162]

# 8 (8) Uttara on Failing

On one occasion the Venerable Uttara was dwelling at Mahisavatthiu, in Dhavajālikā on Mount Sañkheyya. There the Venerable Uttara addressed the bhikkhus....

"Friends, it is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to review his own failings. It is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to review the failings of others. It is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to review his own achievements. It is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to review the achievements of others."

Now on that occasion the great [deva] king Vessavana was traveling from north to south on some business. He heard the Venerable Uttara at Mahisavatthu, in Dhavajālikā on Mount Sankheyya, teaching the Dhamma to the bhikkhus thus: 'Friends, it is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to review his own failings . . . the failings of others . . . his own achievements... the achievements of others.' Then, just as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, Vessavaṇa disappeared from Mount Sañkheyya and reappeared aṃong the Tāvatimsa devas.

He approached Sakka, ruler of the devas, and said to him: "Respected sir, you should know that the Venerable Uttara, at Mahisavatthu, [163] in Dhavajālikā on Mount Sañkheyya, has been teaching the Dhamma to the bhikkhus thus: 'Friends, it is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to review his own
failings . . . the failings of others . . . his own achievements . . . the achievements of others.'"

Then, just as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, Sakka disappeared from among the Tāvatimsa devas and reappeared at Mahisavatthu, in Dhavajālikā on Mount Sankheyya, in front of the Venerable Uttara. He approached the Venerable Uttara, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and said to him:

"Is it true, Bhante, as is said, that you have been teaching the Dhamma to the bhikkhus thus: 'Friends, it is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to review his own failings . . . the failings of others . . . his own achievements . . . the achievements of others'?"

"Yes, ruler of the devas."

"But, Bhante, was this your own discernment, or was it the word of the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One?"

"Well then, ruler of the devas, I will give you a simile; even by means of a simile, some intelligent people understand the meaning of what has been said. Suppose not far from a village or town there was a great heap of grain, and a large crowd of people were to take away grain with carrying-poles, baskets, hip-sacks, [164] and their cupped hands. If someone were to approach that large crowd of people and ask them: 'Where did you get this grain?' what should they say?"

"Bhante, those people should say: 'We got it from that great heap of grain.'"

"So too, ruler of the devas, whatever is well spoken is all the word of the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. I myself and others derive our good words from him."163"

"It's astounding and amazing, Bhante, how well you stated this: 'Whatever is well spoken is all the word of the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. I myself and others derive our good words from him.'

"On one occasion, Bhante Uttara, the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha, on Mount Vulture Peak, not long after Devadatta had left. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus with reference to Devadatta: 'Bhikkhus, it is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to review his own failings. . . [Sakka here cites
the Buddha's entire discourse of 8:7, down to:] [165-66]... It is in such a way, bhikkhus, that you should train yourselves. ${ }^{1628}$

"Bhante Uttara, this exposition of the Dhamma has not been promulgated anywhere among the four human assemblies: that is, among bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, male lay followers, and female lay followers. ${ }^{1629}$ Bhante, learn this exposition of the Dhamma, master this exposition of the Dhamma, and retain this exposition of the Dhamma in mind. This exposition of the Dhamma is beneficial; it pertains to the fundamentals of the spiritual life."

# 9 (9) Nanda

"Bhikkhus, (1) one speaking rightly would say of Nanda that he is a clansman, (2) that he is strong, (3) that he is graceful, and (4) that he is strongly prone to lust. ${ }^{1630}$ How else could Nanda lead the complete and pure spiritual life unless (5) he guarded the doors of the sense faculties, (6) observed moderation in eating, (7) was intent on wakefulness, and (8) possessed mindfulness and clear comprehension?

"Bhikkhus, this is how Nanda guards the doors of the sense faculties: [167] If he needs to look to the east, he does so after he has fully considered the matter and clearly comprehends it thus: 'When I look to the east, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection will not flow in upon me.' If he needs to look to the west... to the north... to the south... to look up ... to look down... to survey the intermediate directions, he does so after he has fully considered the matter and clearly comprehends it thus: 'When I look to the intermediate directions, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection will not flow in upon me.' That is how Nanda guards the doors of the sense faculties.

"This is how Nanda observes moderation in eating: Here, reflecting carefully, Nanda consumes food neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness, but only for the support and maintenance of this body, for avoiding harm, and for assisting the spiritual life, considering: 'Thus I shall terminate the old feeling and not arouse a new feeling, and I shall be healthy and blameless and dwell at ease.' That is how Nanda observes moderation in eating.

"This is how Nanda is intent on wakefulness: [168] During
the day, while walking back and forth and sitting, Nanda purifies his mind of obstructive qualities. In the first watch of the night, while walking back and forth and sitting, he purifies his mind of obstructive qualities. In the middle watch of the night he lies down on the right side in the lion's posture, with one foot overlapping the other, mindful and clearly comprehending, after noting in his mind the idea of rising. After rising, in the last watch of the night, while walking back and forth and sitting, he purifies his mind of obstructive qualities. That is how Nanda is intent on wakefulness.

"This is Nanda's mindfulness and clear comprehension: Nanda knows feelings as they arise, as they remain present, as they disappear; he knows perceptions as they arise, as they remain present, as they disappear; he knows thoughts as they arise, as they remain present, as they disappear. ${ }^{1631}$ That is Nanda's mindfulness and clear comprehension.

"How else, bhikkhus, could Nanda lead the complete and pure spiritual life unless he guarded the doors of the sense faculties, observed moderation in eating, was intent on wakefulness, and possessed mindfulness and clear comprehension?"

# 10 (10) Trash

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Campā on a bank of the Gaggārā Lotus Pond. Now on that occasion bhikkhus were reproving a bhikkhu for an offense. When being reproved, that bhikkhu answered evasively, diverted the discussion to an irrelevant subject, and displayed anger, hatred, and resentment. ${ }^{1632}$ Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: [169] "Bhikkhus, eject this person! Bhikkhus, eject this person! ${ }^{1633}$ This person should be banished. Why should another's son vex you? ${ }^{1634}$

"Here, bhikkhus, so long as the bhikkhus do not see his offense, a certain person has the same manner (1) of going forward and (2) returning, (3) of looking ahead and (4) looking aside, (5) of bending and (6) stretching his limbs, and (7) of wearing his robes and (8) carrying his outer robe and bowl as the good bhikkhus. ${ }^{1635}$ When, however, they see his offense, they know him as a corruption among ascetics, just chaff and trash among ascetics. Then they expel him. For what reason? So that he doesn't corrupt the good bhikkhus.
"Suppose that when a field of barley is growing, some blighted barley would appear that would be just chaff and trash among the barley. As long as its head has not come forth, its roots would be just like those of the other [crops], the good barley; its stem would be just like that of the other [crops], the good barley; its leaves would be just like those of the other [crops], the good barley. When, however, its head comes forth, they know it as blighted barley, just chaff [170] and trash among the barley. Then they pull it up by the root and cast it out from the barley field. For what reason? So that it doesn't spoil the good barley.

"So too, so long as the bhikkhus do not see his offense, a certain person here has the same manner of going forward . . . and carrying his outer robe and bowl as the good bhikkhus. When, however, they see his offense, they know him as a corruption among ascetics, just chaff and trash among ascetics. Then they expel him. For what reason? So that he doesn't corrupt the good bhikkhus.

"Suppose that when a large heap of grain is being winnowed, the grains that are firm and pithy form a pile on one side, and the wind blows the spoiled grains and chaff to another side. Then the owners take a broom and sweep them even further away. For what reason? So that they don't spoil the good grain.

"So too, so long as the bhikkhus do not see his offense, a certain person here has the same manner of going forward . . . and carrying his outer robe and bowl as the others, the good bhikkhus. When, however, the bhikkhus see his offense, they know him as [171] a corruption among ascetics, just chaff and trash among ascetics. Then they expel him. For what reason? So that he doesn't corrupt the good bhikkhus.

"Suppose a man needs a gutter for a well. He would take a sharp axe and enter the woods. He would strike a number of trees with the blade of his axe. ${ }^{1636}$ When so struck, the firm and pithy trees would give off a dull sound, but those that are inwardly rotten, corrupt, and decayed would give off a hollow sound. The man would cut this tree down at its foot, cut off the crown, thoroughly clean it out, and use it as a gutter for a well.

"So too, bhikkhus, so long as the bhikkhus do not see his offense, a certain person here has the same manner of going
forward and returning, of looking ahead and looking aside, of bending and stretching his limbs, of wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl, as the good bhikkhus. When, however, the bhikkhus see his offense, they know him as a corruption among ascétics, just chaff and trash among ascetics. Then they expel him. For what reason? So that he doesn't corrupt the good bhikkhus." [172]

By living together with him, know him as an angry person with evil desires; a denigrator, obstinate, and insolent, envious, miserly, and deceptive.

He speaks to people just like an ascetic, [addressing them] with a calm voice, but secretly he does evil deeds, holds pernicious views, and lacks respect.

Though he is devious, a speaker of lies, you should know him as he truly is; then you should all meet in harmony and firmly drive him away.

Get rid of the trash!

Remove the depraved fellows!

Sweep the chaff away, non-ascetics who think themselves ascetics!

Having banished those of evil desires, of bad conduct and resort, dwell in communion, ever mindful, the pure with the pure;

then, in harmony, alert, you will make an end of suffering.

# II. The Great Chapter

11 (1) Verañja

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Verañja at the foot of Naleru's neem tree. ${ }^{1637}$ Then
a brahmin of Verañja [173] approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When he had concluded his greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

"I have heard, Master Gotama: 'The ascetic Gotama does not pay homage to brahmins who are old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage; nor does he stand up for them or offer them a seat.' This is indeed true, for Master Gotama does not pay homage to brahmins who are old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage; nor does he stand up for them or offer them a seat. This is not proper, Master Gotama."1638

"Brahmin, in the world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, I do not see one to whom I should pay homage, or for whom I should stand up, or whom I should offer a seat. For if the Tathāgata should pay homage to anyone, or stand up for him, or offer him a seat, even that person's head would split."

(1) "Master Gotama lacks taste."1639

"There is, brahmin, a way in which one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama lacks taste.' The Tathāgata has abandoned his taste for forms, sounds, odors, tastes, and tactile objects; he has cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising. It is in this way that one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama lacks taste.' But you did not speak with reference to this." [174]

(2) "Master Gotama is not convivial."1640

"There is, brahmin, a way in which one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is not convivial.' The Tathāgata has abandoned conviviality with forms, sounds, odors, tastes, and tactile objects; he has cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising. It is in this way that one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is not convivial.' But you did not speak with reference to this."

(3) "Master Gotama is a proponent of non-doing."1641

"There is, brahmin, a way in which one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is a proponent of non-doing.' For I assert the non-doing of bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct;

I assert the non-doing of the numerous kinds of bad unwholesome deeds. It is in this way that one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is a proponent of non-doing.' But you did not speak with reference to this."

(4) "Master Gotama is an annihilationist." ${ }^{1642}$

"There is, brahmin, a way in which one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is an annihilationist.' For I assert the annihilation of lust, hatred, and delusion; I assert the annihilation of the numerous kinds of bad unwholesome qualities. It is in this way that one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is an annihilationist.' But you did not speak with reference to this."

(5) "Master Gotama is a repeller." ${ }^{1643}$

"There is, brahmin, a way in which one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is a repeller.' For I am repelled by bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct; I am repelled by the acquisition of the numerous kinds of bad unwholesome [175]. qualities. It is in this way that one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is a repeller.' But you did not speak with reference to this."

(6) "Master Gotama is an abolitionist." ${ }^{1644}$

"There is, brahmin, a way in which one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is an abolitionist.' For I teach the Dhamma for the abolition of lust, hatred, and delusion; I teach the Dhamma for the abolition of the numerous kinds of bad unwholesome qualities. It is in this way that one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotamá is an abolitionist.' But you did not speak with reference to this."

(7) "Master Gotama is a tormentor." ${ }^{1645}$

"There is, brahmin, a way in which one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is a tormentor.' For I assert that bad unwholesome qualities-bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct-are to be burned up. I say that someone is a tormentor when he has abandoned the bad unwholesome qualities that are to be burned up; when he has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so that they are no more subject to future arising. The Tathāgata has abandoned the bad unwholesome qualities that are to be burned up; he has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so that they are no more subject to future arising. It is
in this way that one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is a tormentor.' But you did not speak with reference to this."

(8) "Master Gotama is retiring."1646

"There is, brahmin, a way in which one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is retiring.' For I say that someone is retiring when he has abandoned the production of renewed existence, the future bed of the womb; when he has cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it [176] so that it is no more subject to future arising. The Tathāgata has abandoned the production of renewed existence, the future bed of the womb; he has cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising. It is in this way that one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is retiring.' But you did not speak with reference to this.

"Suppose, brahmin, there was a hen with eight, ten, or twelve eggs that she had properly covered, incubated, and nurtured. Should the first among those chicks to pierce its shell with the points of its claws or beak and safely hatch be called the eldest or the youngest?"

"It should be called the eldest, Master Gotama. So it is the eldest among them."

"So too, brahmin, in a population immersed in ignorance, become like an egg, completely enveloped, ${ }^{1647}$ I have pierced the eggshell of ignorance. I am the sole person in the world who has awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment. So I am the eldest, the best in the world.

"My energy, brahmin, was aroused without slackening; my mindfulness was established without confusion; my body was tranquil without disturbance; my mind was concentrated and one-pointed. Secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, I entered and dwelled in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. With the subsiding of thought and examination, I entered and dwelled in the second jhāna, which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration, without thought and examination. [177] With the fading away as well of rapture, I dwelled equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, I experienced pleasure with the body; I entered and dwelled in the third jhāna of which
the noble ones declare: 'He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.' With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, I entered and dwelled in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity.

"When my mind was thus concentrated, purified, cleansed, unblemished, rid of defilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of the recollection of past abodes. ${ }^{16+8}$ I recollected my manifold past abodes, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many eons of world-dissolution, many eons of world-evolution, many eons of world-dissolution and world-evolution thus: 'There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere, and there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn here.' Thus I recollected my manifold past abodes with their aspects and details.

"This, brahmin, was the first true knowledge attained by me in the first watch of the night. Ignorance was dispelled, true knowledge had arisen; darkness was dispelled, light had arisen, as happens when one dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute. This, brahmin, was my first breaking out, like that of the chick breaking out of the eggshell. [178]

"When my mind was thus concentrated, purified, cleansed, unblemished, rid of defilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings. With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, I saw beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and I understood how beings fare in accordance with their kamma thus: 'These beings who engaged in misconduct by body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong view, and undertook kamma based on wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad
destination, in the lower world, in hell; but these beings who engaged in good conduct by body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right view, and undertook kamma based on right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in a good destination, in the heavenly world.' Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, I saw beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and I understood how beings fare in accordance with their kamma.

"This, brahmin, was the second true knowledge attained by me in the middle watch of the night. Ignorance was dispelled, true knowledge had arisen; darkness was dispelled, light had arisen, as happens when one dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute. This, brahmin, was my second breaking out, like that of the chick breaking out of the eggshell.

"When my mind was thus concentrated, purified, cleansed, unblemished, rid of defilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of the destruction of the taints. I understood as it really is: 'This is suffering'; I understood as it really is: 'This is the origin of suffering'; I understood as it really is: 'This is the cessation of suffering'; I understood as it really is: 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' I understood as it really is: 'These are the taints'; [179] I understood as it really is: 'This is the origin of the taints'; I understood as it really is: 'This is the cessation of the taints'; I understood as it really is: 'This is the way leading to the cessation of the taints.'

"When I knew and saw thus, my mind was liberated from the taint of sensuality, from the taint of existence, and from the taint of ignorance. ${ }^{1649}$ When it was liberated there came the knowledge: '[It's] liberated.' I directly knew: 'Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.'

"This, brahmin, was the third true knowledge attained by me in the last watch of the night. Ignorance was dispelled, true knowledge had arisen; darkness was dispelled, light had arisen, as happens when one dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute. This, brahmin, was my third breaking out, like that of the chick breaking out of the eggshell."

When this was said, the brahmin of Verañja said to the Blessed One: "Master Gotama is the eldest! Master Gotama is the best! Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the darkness so those with good eyesight can see forms. I now go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

# 12 (2) Sîha

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesälī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Now on that occasion, a number of well-known Licchavis had assembled in the meeting hall and were sitting together speaking in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. [180] On that occasion Sîha the general, a disciple of the Niganthas, was sitting in that assembly. It then occurred to him: "Doubtlessly, he must be a Blessed One, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One. For a number of these well-known Licchavis have assembled in the meeting hall and are sitting together speaking in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. Let me go see that Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One."

Then Sîha went to the Nigantha Nātaputta and said to him: "Bhante, I wish to go see the ascetic Gotama."

"Since you are a proponent of deeds, Sîha, why go see the ascetic Gotama, a proponent of non-doing? For the ascetic Gotama is a proponent of non-doing who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of non-doing and thereby guides his disciples. ${ }^{11850}$

Then Sîha's determination to go see the Blessed One subsided.

On a second occasion, a number of well-known Licchavis had assembled in the meeting hall and were sitting together speaking in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha.... [All as above, except this is now said to occur "on a second occasion."] [181]... On a second occasion, Sîha's determination to go see the Blessed One subsided.

On a third occasion, a number of well-known Licchavis had assembled in the meeting hall and were sitting together speaking in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. It then occurred to Siha: "Doubtlessly, he must be a Blessed One, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One. For a number of these well-known Licchavis have assembled in the meeting hall and are sitting together speaking in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. What can the Niganthas do to me whether or not I obtain their permission? Without having obtained the permission of the Niganthas, let me go see that Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. ${ }^{\prime 1651}$

Then, with five hundred chariots, Sitha the general set out from Vesālī in the middle of the day in order to see the Blessed One. He went by carriage as far as the ground was suitable for a carriage, and then dismounted from his carriage and entered the monastery grounds on foot. He approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"I have heard this, Bhante: 'The ascetic Gotama is a proponent of non-doing [182] who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of non-doing and thereby guides his disciples.' Do those who speak thus state what has been said by the Blessed One and not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact? Do they explain in accordance with the Dhamma so that they would not incur any reasonable criticism or ground for censure? ${ }^{1652}$ For we do not want to misrepresent the Blessed One."

(1) "There is, Sīha, a way in which one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is a proponent of non-doing who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of non-doing and thereby guides his disciples. ${ }^{1653}$

(2) "There is a way in which one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is a proponent of deeds who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of deeds and thereby guides his disciples.'

(3) "There is a way in which one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is an annihilationist who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of annihilation and thereby guides his disciples.'

(4) "There is a way in which one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is a repeller who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of repulsion and thereby guides his disciples.'
(5) "There is a way in which one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is an abolitionist who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of abolition and thereby guides his disciples.'

(6) "There is a way in which one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is a tormentor who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of torment and thereby guides his disciples.'

(7) "There is a way in which one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is retiring, one who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of retiring and thereby guides his disciples.'

(8) "There is a way in which one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is a consoler ${ }^{1654}$ who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of consolation and thereby guides his disciples.'

(1) "And in what way, Sîha, could one rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is a proponent of non-doing [183] who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of non-doing and thereby guides his disciples'? For I assert the non-doing of bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct; I assert the non-doing of the numerous kinds of bad unwholesome deeds. It is in this way that one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is a proponent of nondoing who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of non-doing and thereby guides his disciples.'

(2) "And in what way could one rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is a proponent of deeds who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of deeds and thereby guides his disciples'? For I assert good bodily, verbal, and mental conduct; I assert the doing of the numerous kinds of wholesome deeds. It is in this way that one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is a proponent of deeds who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of deeds and thereby guides his disciples.'

(3) "And in what way could one rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is an annihilationist who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of annihilation and thereby guides his disciples'? For I assert the annihilation of lust, hatred, and delusion; I assert the annihilation of the numerous kinds of bad unwholesome qualities. It is in this way that one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is an annihilationist who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of annihilation and thereby guides his disciples.'

(4) "And in what way could one rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is a repeller who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of repulsion and thereby guides his disciples'? For I am repelled
by bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct; I am repelled by the acquisition of the numerous kinds of bad unwholesome qualities. It is in this way that one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is a repeller who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of repulsion and thereby guides his disciples.'

(5) "And in what way could one rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is an abolitionist who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of abolition and thereby guides his disciples'? For I teach the Dhamma for the abolition of lust, hatred, and delusion; [184] I teach the Dhamma for the abolition of the numerous kinds of bad unwholesome qualities. It is in this way that one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is an abolitionist who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of abolition and thereby guides his disciples.'

(6) "And in what way could one rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is a tormentor who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of tormenting and thereby guides his disciples'? For I assert that bad unwholesome qualities-bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct-are to be burned up. I say that someone is a tormentor when he has abandoned the bad unwholesome qualities that are to be burned up; when he has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so that they are no more subject to future arising. The Tathāgata has abandoned the bad unwholesome qualities that are to be burned up; he has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so that they are no more subject to future arising. It is in this way that one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is a tormentor who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of tormenting and thereby guides his disciples.'

(7) "And in what way could one rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is retiring, one who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of retiring and thereby guides his disciples'? For I say that someone is retiring when he has abandoned the production of renewed existence, the future bed of the womb; when he has cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising. The Tathāgata has abandoned the production of renewed existence, the future bed of the womb; he has cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising. It is in this way that one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic

Gotama is retiring, one who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of retiring and thereby guides his disciples.'

(8) "And in what way could one rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is a consoler, one who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of consolation and thereby guides his disciples'? For I [185] am a consoler with the supreme consolation; I teach the Dhamma for the sake of consolation and thereby guide my disciples. It is in this way that one could rightly say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama is a consoler, one who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of consolation and thereby guides his disciples. ${ }^{\prime 11655}$

When this was said, Sitha the general said to the Blessed One: "Excellent, Bhante! Excellent, Bhante! . . . Let the Blessed One accept me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

"Make an investigation, Sīha! It is good for such well-known people like yourself to make an investigation."1656

"Bhante, I am even more satisfied and pleased with the Blessed One for telling me: 'Make an investigation, Sīha! It is good for such well-known people like yourself to make an investigation.' For if the members of other sects were to gain me as their disciple, they would carry a banner all over Vesālī announcing: 'Sīha the general has become our disciple.' But the Blessed One rather tells me: 'Make an investigation, Sīha! It is good for such well-known people like yourself to make an investigation.' So for the second time, Bhante, I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. Let the Blessed One accept me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

"Sīha, your family has long been a fountain of support for the Niganthas; hence you should consider continuing to give alms to them when they approach you."

"Bhante, I am even more satisfied and pleased with the Blessed One for telling me: 'Sīha, your family has long been a fountain of support for the Niganthas; hence you should consider continuing to give alms to them when they approach you.' For I have heard: 'The ascetic Gotama says thus: [186] "Alms should be given only to me, not to others; alms should be given only to my disciples, not to the disciples of others. Only what is given to me is very fruitful, not what is given to others; only what is given to my disciples is very fruitful, not what is given
to the disciples of others." ${ }^{\prime 1657}$ Yet the Blessed One encourages me to give to the Nigan thas, too. We'll know the right time for this. So for the third time, Bhante, I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. Let the Blessed One accept me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

Then the Blessed One gave Sîha the general a progressive discourse, that is, a talk on giving, virtuous behavior, and heaven; he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensual pleasures and the benefit of renunciation. When the Blessed One knew that Sîha's mind was pliant, softened, rid of hindrances, uplifted, and confident, he revealed that Dhamma teaching special to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Then, just as a clean cloth rid of dark spots would readily absorb dye, so too, while Sîha the general sat in that same seat, there arose in him the dust-free, stainless Dhamma-eye: 'Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.' Sîha the general became one who had seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, fathomed the Dhamma, crossed over doubt, gotten rid of bewilderment, attained selfconfidence, and become independent of others in the teaching of the Teacher. He then said to the Blessed One:

"Bhante, please let the Blessed One [187] together with the Sangha of bhikkhus accept tomorrow's meal from me."

The Blessed One consented by silence. Having understood that the Blessed One had consented, Sîha rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed. Then Sîha addressed a man: "Go, good man, find some meat ready for sale."

Then, when the night had passed, Sîha the general had various kinds of excellent foods prepared in his own residence, after which he had the time announced to the Blessed One: "It is time, Bhante, the meal is ready."

Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, went to Sîha's residence along with the Sangha of bhikkhus, and sat down on the seat prepared for him. Now on that occasion a number of Niganthas [went] from street to street and from square to square in Vesālî, thrashing their arms about and crying out: "Today Sîha the general has slain a plump animal to prepare a meal for the ascetic Gotama! The ascetic

Gotama knowingly uses meat [obtained from an animal killed] especially for his sake, the act being done on his account."

Then a man approached Sīha the general and whispered into his ear: "Sir, you should know that a number of Niganthas [are going] from street to street and from square to square in Vesālī, thrashing their arms about and crying out: 'Today Siha the general has slain a plump animal to prepare a meal for the ascetic Gotama! The ascetic Gotama knowingly uses meat [obtained from an animal killed] especially for his sake, [188] a deed done on his account.'"

"Enough, good man. For a long time those venerable ones have wanted to discredit the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. They will never stop ${ }^{1658}$ misrepresenting the Blessed One with what is untrue, baseless, false, and contrary to fact, and we would never intentionally deprive a living being of life, even for the sake of our life."1659

Then, with his own hands, Sīha the general served and satisfied the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with the various kinds of excellent food. Then, when the Blessed One had finished eating and had put away his bowl, Sīha sat down to one side. Then the Blessed One instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened Sīha with a Dhamma talk, after which he rose from his seat and departed.

# 13 (3) Thoroughbred

"Bhikkhus, possessing eight factors, a king's excellent thoroughbred horse is worthy of a king, an accessory of a king, and reckoned as a factor of kingship. What eight?

"Here, (1) a king's excellent thoroughbred horse is well born on both sides, maternal and paternal; he is born in whatever area other excellent thoroughbred horses are born. (2) He respectfully eats whatever food they give him, whether moist or dry, without scattering it. (3) He is repelled by sitting down or lying down near feces or urine. (4) He is mild ${ }^{1660}$ [189] and pleasant to live with, and he does not agitate other horses. (5) He reveals his tricks, ploys, gambits, and wiles as they really are to his trainer so that his trainer can make an effort to stamp them out of him. (6) He carries loads, determined: 'Whether or not the other horses carry loads, I myself will carry them.' (7) When moving, he moves only along a straight path. (8) He is strong, and he shows his strength right up until the end of his
life. Possessing these eight factors, a king's excellent thoroughbred horse is worthy of a king, an accessory of a king, and reckoned as a factor of kingship.

"So too, bhikkhus, possessing eight qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts ... an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What eight?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. (2) He respectfully eats whatever food they give him, whether coarse or excellent, without being annoyed. (3) He is repelled by bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct; he is repelled by the acquisition of the numerous kinds of bad unwholesome qualities. (4) He is mild and pleasant to live with, and he does not agitate other bhikkhus. (5) He reveals his tricks, [190] ploys, gambits, and wiles as they really are to the Teacher or to his wise fellow monks so that they can make an effort to stamp them out of him. (6) He is one who takes up the training, determined: 'Whether or not other bhikkhus train, I will train.' (7) When moving, he moves only along a straight path. In this connection, this is the straight path: right view ... right concentration. (8) He has aroused energy thus: 'Willingly, let only my skin, sinews, and bones remain, and let the flesh and blood dry up in my body, but I will not relax my energy so long as I have not attained what can be attained by manly strength, energy, and exertion. ${ }^{1661}$ Possessing these eight qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts ... an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

# 14 (4) Wild Colts

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you the eight kinds of wild colts and the eight faults of a horse, and I will teach you the eight kinds of persons who are like wild colts and the eight faults of a person. Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"And what, bhikkhus, are the eight kinds of wild colts and the eight faults of a horse?

(1) "Here, when a wild colt is told: 'Go forward!' and is being spurred and incited by its trainer, it backs up [191] and spins the chariot around behind it. ${ }^{1662}$ There is such a kind of wild colt here. This is the first fault of a horse.
(2) "Again, when a wild colt is told: 'Go forward!' and is being spurred and incited by its trainer, it leaps back and [thereby] damages the rail and breaks the triple rod. ${ }^{1663}$ There is such a kind of wild colt here. This is the second fault of a horse.

(3) "Again, when a wild colt is told: 'Go forward!' and is being spurred and incited by its trainer, it loosens its thigh from the chariot pole and crushes the chariot pole. ${ }^{1664}$ There is such a kind of wild colt here. This is the third fault of a horse.

(4) "Again, when a wild colt is told: 'Go forward!' and is being spurred and incited by its trainer, it takes a wrong path and leads the chariot off the track. There is such a kind of wild colt here. This is the fourth fault of a horse.

(5) "Again, when a wild colt is told: 'Go forward!' and is being spurred and incited by its trainer, it leaps up with the front of its body and chums the air with its front feet. There is such a kind of wild colt here. This is the fifth fault of a horse.

(6) "Again, when a wild colt is told: 'Go forward!' and is being spurred and incited by its trainer, it does not heed its trainer or the goad ${ }^{1665}$ but destroys the mouthbit with its teeth [192] and sets out wherever it wishes. There is such a kind of wild colt here. This is the sixth fault of a horse.

(7) "Again, when a wild colt is told: 'Go forward!' and is being spurred and incited by its trainer, it does not go forward or turn back but stands right there as still as a post. There is such a kind of wild colt here. This is the seventh fault of a horse.

(8) "Again, when a wild colt is told: 'Go forward!' and is being spurred and incited by its trainer, it tucks in its front legs and its back legs and sits down right there on all four legs. There is such a kind of wild colt here. This is the eighth fault of a horse.

"These are the eight kinds of wild colts and the eight faults of a horse.

"And what, bhikkhus, are the eight kinds of persons who are like wild colts and the eight faults of a person?

(1) "Here, when the bhikkhus are reproving a bhikkhu for an offense, he exonerates himself by reason of lack of memory, saying: 'I don't remember [committing such an offense].' I say this person is similar to the wild colt that, when told: 'Go forward!' and when spurred and incited by its trainer, backs up and spins the chariot around behind it. There is such a kind of person here like a wild colt. This is the first fault of a person.
(2) "Again, when the bhikkhus are reproving a bhikkhu for an offense, [193] he castigates the reprover himself: 'What right does an incompetent fool like you have to speak? Do you really think you have something to say?' I say this person is similar to the wild colt that, when told: 'Go forward!' and when spurred and incited by its trainer, leaps back and [thereby] damages the rail and breaks the triple pole. There is such a kind of person here like a wild colt. This is the second fault of a person.

(3) "Again, when the bhikkhus are reproving a bhikkhu for an offense, he attributes an offense to the reprover himself, saying: 'You have committed such and such an offense. Make amends for it first.' I say this person is similar to the wild colt that, when told: 'Go forward!' and when spurred and incited by its trainer, loosens its thigh from the chariot pole and crushes the chariot pole. There is such a kind of person here like a wild colt. This is the third fault of a person.

(4) "Again, when the bhikkhus are reproving a bhikkhu for an offense, he answers evasively, diverts the discussion to an irrelevant subject, and displays anger, hatred, and bitterness. I say this person is similar to the wild colt that, when told: 'Go forward!' and when spurred and incited by its trainer, takes a wrong path and leads the chariot off the track. There is such a kind of person here like a wild colt. This is the fourth fault of a person.

(5) "Again, when the bhikkhus are reproving a bhikkhu for an offense, he speaks while waving his arms about in the midst of the Sangha. I say this person is similar to [194] the wild colt that, when told: 'Go forward!' and when spurred and incited by its trainer, leaps up with the front of its body and churns the air with its front feet. There is such a kind of person here like a wild colt. This is the fifth fault of a person.

(6) "Again, when the bhikkhus are reproving a bhikkhu for an offense, he does not heed the Sangha or his reprover but sets out wherever he wishes while still bearing his offense. I say this person is similar to the wild colt that, when told: 'Go forward!' and when spurred and incited by its trainer, does not heed its trainer or the goad but destroys the mouthbit with its teeth and sets out wherever it wishes. There is such a kind of person here like a wild colt. This is the sixth fault of a person.

(7) "Again, when the bhikkhus are reproving a bhikkhu for
an offense, he does not say, 'I committed an offense,' nor does he say, 'I did not commit an offense,' but he vexes the Sangha by keeping silent. I say this person is similar to the wild colt that, when told: 'Go forward!' and when spurred and incited by its trainer, does not go forward or turn back but stands right there as still as a post. There is such a kind of person here like a wild colt. This is the seventh fault of a person.

(8) "Again, when the bhikkhus are reproving a bhikkhu for an offense, he says: [195] 'Why are you making such a fuss about me? Now I'll reject the training and return to the lower life.' He then rejects the training, returns to the lower life, and declares: 'Now you can be satisfied!' I say this person is similar to the wild colt that, when told: 'Go forward!' and when spurred and incited by its trainer, tucks in its front legs and its back legs and sits down right there on all four legs. There is such a kind of person here like a wild colt. This is the eighth fault of a person.

"These, bhikkhus, are the eight kinds' of persons who are like wild colts and the eight faults of a person."

# 15 (5) Stains

"Bhikkhus, there are these eight stains. What eight? (1) Nonrecitation is the stain of the hymns. (2) The stain of houses is lack of upkeep. ${ }^{1666}$ (3) The stain of beauty is laziness. (4) Heedlessness is the stain of a guard. (5) A woman's stain is misconduct. (6) Miserliness is a donor's stain. (7) Bad unwholesome qualities are stains in this world and the next. (8) A stain graver than this is ignorance, the very worst of stains. These, bhikkhus, are the eight stains."

Non-recitation is the stain of the hymns; ${ }^{1667}$

the stain of houses is lack of upkeep;

the stain of beauty is laziness,

heedlessness is the stain of a guard.

A woman's stain is misconduct, miserliness is a donor's stain;

bad unwholesome qualities are stains

in this world and the next.

A stain graver than these

is ignorance, the worst of stains. [196]

16 (6) Mission

"Bhikkhus, possessing eight qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of going on a mission. What eight?

"Here, (1)-(2) a bhikkhu is one who listens and makes others listen; (3)-(4) he is one who learns well and makes others learn; (5)-(6) he is one who understands and communicates well; (7) he is skilled in [knowing] what is relevant and what irrelevant; and (8) he does not foment quarrels. Possessing these eight qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of going on a mission.

"Bhikkhus, possessing eight qualities, Sāriputta is worthy of going on a mission. What eight?

"Here, Sāriputta is one who listens and who makes others listen... he does not foment quarrels. Possessing these eight qualities, Sāriputta is worthy of going on a mission."

One who does not tremble when he arrives at an assembly with fierce debaters; who does not omit words or conceal his message;

who speaks without hesitation, and does not waver when asked a question;

a bhikkhu like this is worthy of going on a mission.

# 17 (7) Bondage (1)

"Bhikkhus, a woman binds a man in eight ways. What eight? A woman binds a man by her form... by her smile ... by her speech... by singing [197]... by weeping... by her appearance ... by a present ${ }^{1668} \ldots$. by her touch. ${ }^{1669}$ A woman binds a man in these eight ways. Those beings are thoroughly bound who are bound by touch."1670

18 (8) Bondage (2)

"Bhikkhus, a man binds a woman in eight ways. What eight? A man binds a woman by his form... by his smile ... by his speech . . . by singing . . . by weeping . . . by his appearance . . . by a present . . . by his touch. A man binds a woman in these eight ways. Those beings are thoroughly bound who are bound by touch."

# 19 (9) Pahärāda

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Verañjā at the foot of Naleru's neem tree. Then Pahärāda, ruler of the asuras, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. The Blessed One then said to him: [198]

"Pahārāda, do the asuras take delight in the great ocean?"

"Bhante, the asuras do take delight in the great ocean."

"But, Pahārāda, how many astounding and amazing qualities do the asuras see in the great ocean because of which they take delight in it?"

"The asuras see eight astounding and amazing qualities in the great ocean because of which they take delight in it. What eight?

(1) "The great ocean, Bhante, slants, slopes, and inclines gradually, not dropping off abruptly. ${ }^{1671}$ This is the first astounding and amazing quality that the asuras see in the great ocean because of which they take delight in it.

(2) "Again, the great ocean is stable and does not overflow its boundaries. This is the second astounding and amazing quality that the asuras see in the great ocean....

(3) "Again, the great ocean does not associate with a corpse, but quickly carries it to the coast and washes it ashore. This is the third astounding and amazing quality that the asuras see in the great ocean....

(4) "Again, when the great rivers-the Ganges, the Yamunā, the Aciravati, the Sarabhū, and the Mahī-reach the great ocean, they give up their former rames and designations [199] and are simply called the great ocean. This is the fourth astounding and amazing quality that the asuras see in the great ocean....

(5) "Again, whatever streams in the world flow into the great ocean and however much rain falls into it from the sky, neither a decrease nor a filling up can be seen in the great ocean. This is the fifth astounding and amazing quality that the asuras see in the great ocean....

(6) "Again, the great ocean has but one taste, the taste of salt. This is the sixth astounding and amazing quality that the asuras see in the great ocean....

(7) "Again, the great ocean contains many precious substances, numerous precious substances such as pearls, gems, lapis lazuli, conch, quartz, coral, silver, gold, rubies, and cats-
eye. This [200] is the seventh astounding and amazing quality that the asuras see in the great ocean....

(8) "Again, the great ocean is the abode of great beings such as timis, timingalas, timirapingalas, asuras, nāgas, and gandhabbas. ${ }^{1672}$ There are in the great ocean beings with bodies one hundred yojanas long, two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, and five hundred yojanas long. This is the eighth astounding and amazing quality that the asuras see in the great ocean because of which they take delight in it.

"These, Bhante, are the eight astounding and amazing qualities that the asuras see in the great ocean because of which they take delight in it. But do the bhikkhus take delight in this Dhamma and discipline?"

"Pahārāda, the bhikkhus do take delight in this Dhamma and discipline."

"But, Bhante, how many astounding and amazing qualities do the bhikkhus see in this Dhamma and discipline because of which they take delight in it?"

"The bhikkhus see eight astounding and amazing qualities in this Dhamma and discipline because of which they take delight in it. What eight?

(1) "Just as, Pahārāda, the great ocean slants, slopes, and inclines gradually, not dropping off abruptly, [201] so too, in this Dhamma and discipline penetration to final knowledge occurs by gradual training, gradual activity, and gradual practice, not abruptly. ${ }^{1673}$ This is the first astounding and amazing quality that the bhikkhus see in this Dhamma and discipline because of which they take delight in it.

(2) "Just as the great ocean is stable and does not overflow its boundaries, so too, when I have prescribed a training rule for my disciples, they will not transgress it even for life's sake. This is the second astounding and amazing quality that the bhikkhus see in this Dhamma and discipline....

(3) "Just as the great ocean does not associate with a corpse, but quickly carries it to the coast and washes it ashore, so too, the Sangha does not associate with a person who is immoral, of bad character, impure, of suspect behavior, secretive in his actions, not an ascetic though claiming to be one, not a celibate though claiming to be one, inwardly rotten, corrupt, depraved; rather, it quickly assembles and expels him. Even though he
is seated in the midst of the Sangha of bhikkhus, yet he is far from the Sangha and the Sangha is far from him. [202] This is the third astounding and amazing quality that the bhikkhus see in this Dhamma and discipline....

(4) "Just as, when the great rivers ... reach the great ocean, they give up their former names and designations and are simply called the great ocean, so too, when members of the four social classes-khattiyas, brahmins, vessas, and suddas-go forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, they give up their former names and clans and are simply called ascetics following the Sakyan son. This is the fourth astounding and amazing quality that the bhikkhus see in this Dhamma and discipline....

(5) "Just as, whatever streams in the world flow into the great ocean and however much rain falls into it from the sky, neither a decrease nor a filling up can be seen in the great ocean, so too, even if many bhikkhus attain final nibbāna by way of the nibbāna element without residue remaining, neither a decrease nor a filling up can be seen in the nibbāna element. ${ }^{1674}$ [203] This is the fifth astounding and amazing quality that the bhikkhus see in this Dhamma and discipline....

(6) "Just as the great ocean has but one taste, the taste of salt, so too, this Dhamma and discipline has but one taste, the taste of liberation. This is the sixth astounding and amazing quality that the bhikkhus see in this Dhamma and discipline....

(7) "Just as the great ocean contains many precious substances, numerous precious substances such as pearls...catseye, so too, this Dhamma and discipline contains many precious substances, numerous precious substances: the four establishments of mindfulness, the four right strivings, the four bases for psychic potency, the five spiritual faculties, the five powers, the seven factors of enlightenment, the noble eightfold path. This is the seventh astounding and amazing quality that the bhikkhus see in this Dhamma and discipline....

(8) "Just as the great ocean is the abode of great beings such as timis ... [204] ... gandhabbas; and as there are in the great ocean beings with bodies one hundred yojanas long... five hundred yojanas long, so too this Dhamma and discipline is the abode of great beings: the stream-enterer, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of stream-entry; the once-returner,
the one practicing for realization of the fruit of once-returning; the non-returner, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of non-returning; the arahant, the one practicing for arahantship. This is the eighth astounding and amazing quality that the bhikkhus see in this Dhamma and discipline because of which they take delight in it.

"These, Pahärāda, are the eight astounding and amazing qualities that the bhikkhus see in this Dhamma and discipline because of which they take delight in it."

20 (10) Uposatha ${ }^{1675}$

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Migāramātā's Mansion in the Eastern Park. Now on that occasion, on the day of the uposatha, the Blessed One was sitting surrounded by the Sangha of bhikkhus. Then, as the night advanced, when the first watch passed, the Venerable Ānanda rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, reverently saluted the Blessed One, and said to him: "Bhante, the night has advanced; the first watch has passed; the Sangha of bhikkhus has been sitting for a long time. Let the Blessed One recite the Pātimokkha to the bhikkhus." When this was said, the Blessed One was silent. [205]

As the night advanced [still further], when the middle watch passed, the Venerable Ananda rose from his seat a second time, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, reverently saluted the Blessed One, and said to him: "Bhante, the night has advanced [still further]; the middle watch has passed; the Sangha of bhikkhus has been sitting for a long time. Bhante, let the Blessed One recite the Pātimokkha to the bhikkhus." A second time the Blessed One was silent.

As the night advanced [still further], when the last watch passed, when dawn arrived and a rosy tint appeared on the horizon, the Venerable Ānanda rose from his seat a third time, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, reverently saluted the Blessed One, and said to him: "Bhante, the night has advanced [still further]; the last watch has passed; dawn has arrived and a rosy tint has appeared on the horizon; the Sangha of bhikkhus has been sitting for a long time. Let the Blessed One recite the Pātimokkha to the bhikkhus."

"This assembly, Ānanda, is impure."

Then it occurred to the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna: "What person was the Blessed One referring to when he said: 'This assembly, Ānanda, is impure'?" Then the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna fixed his attention on the entire Sangha of bhikkhus, encompassing their minds with his own mind. He then saw that person sitting in the midst of the Sangha of bhikkhus: one who was immoral, of bad character, impure, of suspect behavior, secretive in his actions, not an ascetic though claiming to be one, not a celibate though claiming to be one, inwardly rotten, corrupt, depraved. Having seen him, he rose from his seat, went up to that person, and said to him: "Get up, friend. The Blessed One has seen you. You cannot live in communion with the bhikkhus." When this was said, that person remained silent.

A second time : . . A third time the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said to that person: [206] "Get up, friend. The Blessed One has seen you. You cannot live in communion with the bhikkhus." A third time that person remained silent.

Then the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna grabbed that person by the arm, evicted him through the outer gatehouse, and bolted the door. Then he returned to the Blessed One and said to him: "I have evicted that person, Bhante. The assembly is pure. Let the Blessed One recite the Pātimokkha to the bhikkhus."

"It's astounding and amazing, Moggallāna, how that hollow man waited ${ }^{1676}$ until he was grabbed by the arm." Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Now, bhikkhus, you yourselves should conduct the uposatha and recite the Pātimokkha. From today onward, I will no longer do so. It is impossible and inconceivable that the Tathāgata could conduct the uposatha and recite the Pātimokkha in an impure assembly.

"The asuras, bhikkhus, see these eight astounding and amazing qualities in the great ocean because of which they take delight in it. What eight?

(1) "The great ocean, bhikkhus, slants, slopes, and inclines gradually, not dropping off abruptly. This is the first astounding and amazing quality that the asuras see in the great ocean because of which they take delight in it....

[All as in 8:19, but addressed to the bhikkhus.]

(8) "Again, the great ocean is the abode of great beings... [207]...five hundred yojanas long. This is the eighth astound-
ing and amazing quality that the asuras see in the great ocean because of which they take delight in it.

"These, bhikkhus, are the eight astounding and amazing qualities that the asuras see in the great ocean because of which they take delight in it. So too, the bhikkhus see eight astounding and amazing qualities in this Dhamma and discipline because of which they take delight in it. What eight?

(1) "Just as, bhikkhus, the great ocean slants, slopes, and inclines gradually, not dropping off abruptly, so too, in this Dhamma and discipline penetration to final knowledge occurs by gradual training, gradual activity, and gradual practice, not abruptly. This is the first astounding and amazing quality that the bhikkhus see in this Dhamma and discipline because of which they take delight in it.

[All as in 8:19, but addressed to the bhikkhus.]

(8) "Just as the great ocean is the abode of great beings ... five hundred yojanas [208] long, so too, this Dhamma and discipline is the abode of great beings: the stream-enterer, the one practicing for the realization of the fruit of stream-entry ... the arahant, the one practicing for arahantship. This is the eighth astounding and amazing quality that the bhikkhus see in this Dhamma and discipline because of which they take delight in it.

"These, bhikkhus, are the eight astounding and amazing qualities that the bhikkhus see in this Dhamma and discipline because of which they take delight in it."

# III. HOUSEHOLDERS

21 (1) Ugga (1)

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, you should remember the householder Ugga of Vesālī as one who possesses eight astounding and amazing qualities." ${ }^{1677}$ [209] This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One rose from his seat and entered his dwelling.

Then, in the morning, a certain bhikkhu dressed, took his
bowl and robe, and went to the residence of the householder Ugga of Vesälī. When he arrived, he sat down on the seat that was prepared for him. Then the householder Ugga of Vesālī approached that bhikkhu, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The bhikkhu then said to him:

"Householder, the Blessed One declared that you possess eight astounding and amazing qualities. What are they?"

"I don't know, Bhante, what eight astounding and amazing qualities the Blessed One declared that I possess. However, there are found in me eight astounding and amazing qualities. Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, householder," the bhikkhu replied. The householder Ugga of Vesālī said this:

(1) "When, Bhante, Ifirst saw the Blessed One in the distance, as soon as I saw him my mind acquired confidence in him. This is the first astounding and amazing quality found in me.

(2) "With a confident mind, I attended on the Blessed One. The Blessed One then gave me a progressive discourse, that is, a talk on giving, virtuous behavior, and heaven; he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensual pleasures and the benefit of renunciation. When the Blessed One knew that my mind was pliant, softened, rid of hindrances, uplifted, and confident, he [210] revealed that Dhamma teaching special to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Then, just as a clean cloth rid of dark spots would readily absorb dye, so too, while I sat in that same seat, the dustfree, stainless Dhamma-eye arose in me: 'Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.' I saw the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, fathomed the Dhamma, crossed over doubt, got rid of bewilderment, attained self-confidence, and became independent of others in the teaching of the Teacher. Right there I went for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and undertook the training rules with celibacy as the fifth. ${ }^{1678}$ This is the second astounding and amazing quality found in me.

(3) "I had four young wives. I then went to them and said: 'Sisters, I have undertaken the training rules with celibacy as the fifth. If you want, you can enjoy wealth right here and do merits, or go back to your own family circle, or inform me if you want me to give you over to another man.' My eldest wife then said to me: 'Young sir, give me to such and such a man.' I sent for
that man, and with my left hand I took my wife, with my right hand I took the ceremonial vase, and I gave her to that man. But even while giving away my young wife, I don't recall that any alteration took place in my mind. This is the third astounding and amazing quality found in me. [211]

(4) "My family is wealthy but the wealth is shared unreservedly with virtuous people of good character. This is the fourth astounding and amazing quality found in me.

(5) "Whenever I attend on a bhikkhu, I attend on him respectfully, not without respect. This is the fifth astounding and amazing quality found in me.

(6) "If that venerable one teaches me the Dhamma, I listen to it respectfully, not without respect. If he doesn't teach me the Dhamma, then I teach him the Dhamma. This is the sixth astounding and amazing quality found in me.

(7) "It isn't unusual for deities to come and report to me: 'Householder, the Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One.' I then say to those deities: 'Whether you say so or not, the Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One.' Still, I do not recall any mental exultation arising because deities come to me or because I converse with deities. This is the seventh astounding and amazing quality found in me.

(8) "Of the five lower fetters taught by the Blessed One, I don't see any that I haven't abandoned. ${ }^{1679}$ This is the eighth astounding and amazing quality found in me. [212]

"These, Bhante, are eight astounding and amazing qualities found in me. But I don't know what eight astounding and amazing qualities the Blessed One declared that I possess."

Then that bhikkhu, having received almsfood at the residence of the householder Ugga of Vesālī, rose from his seat and departed. After his meal, on returning from his alms round, he approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and reported to him the entire conversation he had had with the householder Ugga of Vesālī.

[The Blessed One said:] "Good, good, bhikkhuf I had declared that the householder Ugga of Vesālī possesses the same eight astounding and amazing qualities that he rightly explained to you. You should remember the householder Ugga of Vesālī as one who possesses these eight astounding and amazing qualities."

22 (2) Ugga (2)

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Vajjis at Hatthigāma. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus....

"Bhikkhus, you should remember the householder Ugga of Hatthigama as one who possesses eight astounding and amazing qualities." This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One rose from his seat and entered his dwelling.

Then, in the morning, a certain bhikkhu dressed, took his bowl and robe, and went to the residence of the householder Ugga of Hatthigāma. When he arrived, he sat down on the seat that was prepared for him. Then the householder Ugga of Hatthigāma approached that bhikkhu, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The bhikkhu then said to him: [213]

"Householder, the Blessed One declared that you possess. eight astounding and amazing qualities. What are they?"

"I don't know, Bhante, what eight astounding and amazing qualities the Blessed One. declared that I possess. However, there are found in me eight astounding and amazing qualities. Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, householder," the bhikkhu replied. The householder Ugga of Hatthigāma said this:

(1) "Bhante, I was carousing in the Nāga Grove when I first saw the Blessed One in the distance. As soon as I saw him my mind acquired confidence in him and my drunkenness vanished. This is the first astounding and amazing quality found in me.

(2) "With a confident mind, I attended on the Blessed One. The Blessed One then gave me a progressive discourse....[as in 8:21]... Right there [214] I went for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and undertook the training rules with celibacy as the fifth. This is the second astounding and amazing quality found in me.

(3) "I had four young wives. I then went to them... [as in 8:21]... But even while giving away my young wife, I don't recall that any alteration took place in my mind. This is the third astounding and amazing quality found in me.

(4)."My family is wealthy but the wealth is shared unreservedly with virtuous people of good character. This is the fourth astounding and amazing quality found in me. [215]
(5) "Whenever I attend on a bhikkhu, I attend on him respectfully, not without respect. If that venerable one teaches me the Dhamma, I listen to it respectfully, not without respect. If he doesn't teach me the Dhamma, then I teach him the Dhamma. This is the fifth astounding and amazing quality found in me.

(6) "It isn't unusual that when the Sangha has been invited by me [for a meal], deities come and report to me: 'That bhikkhu, householder, is liberated in both respects. That one is liberated by wisdom. That one is a body witness. That one is attained to view. That one is liberated by faith. That one is a Dhamma follower. That one is a faith follower. That one is virtuous, of good character. That one is immoral, of bad character.' Still, when I am serving the Sangha, I do not recall thinking: 'Let me give this one little, let me give that one a lot.' Rather, I give with an equal mind. This is the sixth astounding and amazing quality found in me.

(7) "It isn't unusual for deities to come and report to me: "Householder, the Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One.' I then say to those deities: 'Whether you deities say so or not, the Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One.' Still, I do not recall any mental exultation arising because deities come to me or because I converse with deities. This is the seventh astounding and amazing quality found in me. [216]

(8) "If I were to pass away before the Blessed One, it wouldn't be surprising if the Blessed One would declare of me: 'There is no fetter bound by which the householder Ugga of Hatthigama might return to this world. ${ }^{1680}$ This is the eighth astounding and amazing quality found in me.

"These, Bhante, are eight astounding and amazing qualities found in me. But I don't know what eight astounding and amazing qualities the Blessed One declared that I possess."

Then that bhikkhu, having received almsfood at the residence of the householder Ugga of Hatthigāma, rose from his seat and departed. After his meal, on returning from his alms round, he approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and reported to him the entire conversation he had had with the householder Ugga of Hatthigāma.

[The Blessed One said:] "Good, good, bhikkhu! I had declared that the householder Ugga of Hatthigāma possesses these same eight astounding and amazing qualities that he rightly explained to you. You should remember the householder Ugga
of Hatthigāma as one who possesses these eight astounding and amazing qualities."

# 23 (3) Hatthaka (1)

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Alavi at the Aggalava Shrine. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus....[217]

"Bhikkhus, you should remember Hatthaka of Alavi as one who possesses seven astounding and amazing qualities. What seven? (1) Hatthaka of Alavi is endowed with faith. (2) He is virtuous, and (3) has a sense of moral shame and (4) moral dread. (5) He is learned, (6) generous, and (7) wise. You should remember Hatthaka of Alavi as one who possesses these seven astounding and amazing qualities." This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One rose from his seat and entered his dwelling.

Then, in the morning, a certain bhikkhu dressed, took his bowl and robe, and went to the residence of Hatthaka of Alavi. When he arrived, he sat down on the seat that was prepared for him. Then Hatthaka of Alavi approached the bhikkhu, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The bhikkhu then said to him:

"Friend, ${ }^{1681}$ the Blessed One declared that you possess seven astounding and amazing qualities. What seven? 'Bhikkhus, Hatthaka of Alavi is endowed with faith. He is virtuous and has a sense of moral shame and moral dread. He is learned, generous, and wise.' The Blessed One declared that you possess these seven astounding and amazing qualities."

"I hope, Bhante, that no white-robed layman was present?"

"No, friend. No white-robed layman was present."

"That's good, Bhante."

Then that bhikkhu, having received almsfood at the residence of Hatthaka of Alavi, rose from his seat and departed. After his meal, on returning from his alms round, he approached the Blessed One, [218] paid homage to him, sat down to one side, [and reported to him all that had happened]. ${ }^{1682}$

[The Blessed One said:] "Good, good, bhikkhu! That clansman has few desires, since he does not want his inner wholesome qualities to be known by others. Therefore, bhikkhu, you should remember Hatthaka of Alavi as one who possesses this
eighth astounding and amazing quality, that is, (8) fewness of desires."

# 24 (4) Hatthaka (2)

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Alavi at the Aggalava Shrine. Then Hatthaka of Alavi, accompanied by five hundred lay followers, [219] approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Your retinue is large, Hatthaka. How do you sustain this large retinue?"

"I do so, Bhante, by the four means of sustaining a favorable relationship taught by the Blessed One. ${ }^{1683}$ When I know: 'This one is to be sustained by a gift,' I sustain him by a gift. When I know: 'This one is to be sustained by endearing speech,' I sustain him by endearing speech. When I know: 'This one is to be sustained by beneficial conduct,' I sustain him by beneficent conduct. When I know: 'This one is to be sustained by impartiality,' I sustain him by impartiality. There is wealth in my family, Bhante. They don't think they should listen to me as if I were poor. ${ }^{\prime 1684}$

"Good, good, Hatthaka! This is the method by which you can sustain a large retinue. For all those in the past who sustained a large retinue did so by these same four means of sustaining a favorable relationship. All those in the future who will sustain a large retinue will do so by these same four means of sustaining a favorable relationship. And all those at present who sustain a large retinue do so by these same four means of sustaining a favorable relationship."

Then, after the Blessed One had instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened Hatthaka of Alavi with a Dhamma talk, Hatthaka rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, [220] and departed.

Then, not long after Hatthaka of Alavi had left, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, you should remember Hatthaka of Alavi as one who possesses eight astounding and amazing qualities. What eight? (1) He is endowed with faith. (2) He is virtuous, and (3) has a sense of moral shame and (4) moral dread. (5) He is learned, (6) generous, and (7) wise. (8)

He has few desires. You should remember Hatthaka of $\bar{A} l a v i$ as one who possesses these eight astounding and amazing qualities."

# 25 (5) Mahānāma

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Park. Then Mahānāma the Sakyan approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"In what way, Bhante, is one a lay follower?"

"When, Mahānāma, one has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, in that way one is a lay follower."

"In what way, Bhante, is a lay follower virtuous?"

"When, Mahānāma, a lay follower abstains from the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, in that way a lay follower is virtuous."

"In what way, Bhante, is a lay follower practicing for his own welfare but not for the welfare of others?" [221]

(1) "When, Mahānāma, a lay follower is himself accomplished in faith but does not encourage others to accomplish faith; (2) when he is himself accomplished in virtuous behavior but does not encourage others to accomplish virtuous behavior; (3) when he is himself accomplished in generosity but does not encourage others to accomplish generosity; (4) when he himself wants to see bhikkhus but does not encourage others to see bhikkhus; (5) when he himself wants to hear the good Dhamma but does not encourage others to hear the good Dhamma; (6) when he himself retains in mind the teachings he has heard but does not encourage others to retain the teachings in mind; (7) when he himself examines the meaning of the teachings that have been retained in mind but does not encourage others to examine their meaning; (8) when he himself has understood the meaning and the Dhamma and practices in accordance with the Dhamma, but does not encourage others to do so: it is in this way, Mahānāma, that a lay follower. is practicing for his own welfare but not for the welfare of others.
"In what way, Bhante, is a lay follower practicing for his own welfare and for the welfare of others?"

(1) "When, Mahānāma, a lay follower is himself accomplished in faith and also encourages others to accomplish faith; (2) when he is himself accomplished in virtuous behavior and also encourages others to accomplish virtuous behavior; (3) when he is himself accomplished in generosity and also encourages others to accomplish generosity; (4) when he himself wants to see bhikkhus and also encourages others to see bhikkhus; (5) when he himself wants to hear the good Dhamma and also encourages others to hear the good Dhamma; (6) when he himself retains in mind the teachings he has heard and also encourages others to retain the teachings in mind; (7) when he himself examines the meaning of the teachings that have been retained in mind and also encourages others to examine their meaning; (8) when he himself understands the meaning [222] and the Dhamma and then practices in accordance with the Dhamma, and also encourages others to practice in accordance with the Dhamma: it is in this way, Mahānāma, that a lay follower is practicing for his own welfare and also for the welfare of others."

# 26 (6) Jivaka

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in Jīvaka's mango grove. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: ${ }^{1685}$

"In what way, Bhante, is one a lay follower?"

[The rest as in 8:25.] [223]

## 27 (7) Powers (1)

"Bhikkhus, there are these eight powers. What eight? (1) The power of children is weeping; (2) the power of women is anger; (3) the power of thieves is a weapon; (4) the power of kings is sovereignty; (5) the power of fools is to complain; (6) the power of the wise is to deliberate; ${ }^{1686}$ (7) the power of the learned is reflection; (8) the power of ascetics and brahmins is patience. These are the eight powers."

28 (8) Powers (2)

Then the Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One.... The Blessed One then said to him: [224]

"Sāriputta, when a bhikkhu's taints have been destroyed, how many powers does he possess by reason of which he can claim: 'My taints have been destroyed'?"

"Bhante, when a bhikkhu's taints have been destroyed, he possesses eight powers by reason of which he can claim: 'My taints have been destroyed.' What eight?

(1) "Here, Bhante, a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has clearly seen all conditioned phenomena as they really are with correct wisdom as impermanent. This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed on the basis of which he can claim: 'My taints have been destroyed.'

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has clearly seen sensual pleasures as they really are with correct wisdom as similar to a charcoal pit. This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed....

(3) "Again, the mind of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed slants, slopes, and inclines to seclusion; it is withdrawn, ${ }^{1667}$ delighting in renunciation, and is entirely finished with all things that are a basis for the taints. This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed....

(4) "Again, a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has developed and well developed the four establishments of mindfulness. Since [225] that is so, this is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed....

(5)-(8) "Again, a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has developed and well developed the four bases for psychic potency . . . the five spiritual faculties . . . the seven factors of enlightenment... the noble eightfold path. This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed on the basis of which he can claim: 'My taints have been destroyed.'

"Bhante, when a bhikkhu's taints have been destroyed, he possesses these eight powers on the basis of which he can claim: 'My taints have been destroyed.'"

# 29 (9) Inopportune Moments

"Bhikkhus, the uninstructed worldling says: 'The world has gained the opportunity! The world has gained the opportunity! ${ }^{1688}$ but he does not know what is an opportunity and what
is not an opportunity. There are, bhikkhus, these eight inopportune moments that are not right occasions for living the spiritual life. What eight?

(1) "Here, a Tathāgata has arisen in the world, an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, an Enlightened One, a Blessed One, and the Dhamma leading to peace, nibbāna, and enlightenment is taught as proclaimed by a Fortunate One. But a person has been reborn in hell. This is the first inopportune moment that is not the right occasion for living the spiritual life. [226]

(2) "Again, a Tathāgata has arisen in the world... and the Dhamma leading to peace, nibbāna, and enlightenment is taught as proclaimed by a Fortunate One. But a person has been reborn in the animal realm. This is the second inopportune moment that is not the right occasion for living the spiritual life.

(3) "Again, a Tathāgata has arisen in the world... and the Dhamma leading to peace, nibbāna, and enlightenment is taught as proclaimed by a Fortunate One. But a person has been reborn in the sphere of afflicted spirits. This is the third inopportune moment that is not the right occasion for living the spiritual life.

(4) "Again, a Tathāgata has arisen in the world... and the Dhamma leading to peace, nibbāna, and enlightenment is taught as proclaimed by a Fortunate One. But a person has been reborn in a certain order of long-lived devas. ${ }^{1689}$ This is the fourth inopportune moment that is not the right occasion for living the spiritual life.

(5) "Again, a Tathāgata has arisen in the world... and the Dhamma leading to peace, nibbāna, and enlightenment is taught as proclaimed by a Fortunate One. But a person has been reborn in the outlying provinces among the uncouth foreigners, [a place] to which bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, male lay followers, and female lay followers do not travel. This is the fifth inopportune moment that is not the right occasion for living the spiritual life.

(6) "Again, a Tathāgata has arisen in the world... and the Dhamma leading to peace, nibbāna, and enlightenment is taught as proclaimed by a Fortunate One. A person has been reborn in the central provinces, but he holds wrong view and
has a distorted perspective: 'There is nothing given, nothing sacrificed, nothing offered; there is no fruit or result of good and bad actions; there is no this world, no other world; there is no mother, no father; there are no beings spontaneously reborn; there are in the world no ascetics and brahmins of right conduct and right practice who, having realized this world and the other world for themselves by direct knowledge, make them known to others.' This is the sixth inopportune moment that is not the right occasion for living the spiritual life.

(7) "Again, a Tathāgata has arisen in the world... and the Dhamma leading to peace, nibbāna, and enlightenment is taught as proclaimed by a Fortunate One. A person has been reborn in the central provinces, but he is unwise, stupid, obtuse, unable to understand the meaning of what has been well stated and badly stated. This is the seventh inopportune moment that is not the right occasion for living the spiritual life.

(8) "Again, a Tathāgata has not arisen in the world . . . and the Dhamma [227] leading to peace, nibbāna, and enlightenment is not taught as proclaimed by a Fortunate One. But a person has been reborn in the central provinces, and he is wise, intelligent, astute, able to understand the meaning of what has been well stated and badly stated. This is the eighth inopportune moment that is not the right occasion for living the spiritual life.

"These are the eight inopportune moments that are not the right occasions for living the spiritual life.

"There is, bhikkhus, one unique opportune moment that is the right occasion for living the spiritual life. What is it? Here, a Tathāgata has arisen in the world, an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, an Enlightened One, a Blessed One, and the Dhamma leading to peace, nibbāna, and enlightenment is taught as proclaimed by a Fortunate One. And a person has been reborn in the central provinces, and he is wise, intelligent, astute, able to understand the meaning of what has been well stated and badly stated. This, bhikkhus, is the one unique opportune moment that is the right occasion for living the spiritual life."

Having obtained the human state when the good Dhamma has been well proclaimed,
those who do not seize the moment have let the right moment slip by.

For many inopportune times are spoken of, occasions obstructive to the path; for it is only sometimes, on occasion, that Tathāgatas arise in the world.

If one has directly encountered them, [fortune] rarely gained in the world, if one has obtained the human state, and the good Dhamma is being taught, for a person desiring his own good, this is incentive enough to strive. [228]

How can one understand the good Dhamma, so that the moment won't slip by? For those who miss the moment grieve when they are reborn in hell.

One here who has failed to obtain the fixed course of the good Dhamma, ${ }^{1590}$ will come to regret it for a long time like a merchant who has missed a profit.

A person hindered by ignorance who has failed in the good Dhamma will long experience wandering on in [the round of] birth and death.

But those who gain the human state when the good Dhamma is well proclaimed, have accomplished the Teacher's word, or will do so, or are doing so now.

Those who have practiced the path, proclaimed by the Tathāgata, have penetrated the right moment in the world the unsurpassed spiritual life.

You should dwell without leakages, guarded, ever-mindful in the restraints taught by the One with Vision, the Kinsman of the Sun.

Having cut off all underlying tendencies that follow one drifting in Māra's domain, ${ }^{1691}$ those who attain the destruction of the taints, though in the world, have gone beyond.

# 30 (10) Anuruddha

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Bhaggas in Sumsumāragira in the deer park at Bhesakalā Grove. Now on that occasion the Venerable Anuruddha dwelled among the Cetis in the eastern bamboo park. While the Venerable Anuruddha was alone in seclusion, a course of thought arose in his mind thus: ${ }^{1692}$

(1) "This Dhamma is for one with few desires, not for one with strong desires. (2) This [229] Dhamma is for one who is content, not for one who is discontent. (3) This Dhamma is for one who resorts to solitude, not for one who delights in company. (4) This Dhamma is for one who is energetic, not for one who is lazy. (5) This Dhamma is for one with mindfulness established, not for one who is muddle-minded. (6) This Dhamma is for one who is concentrated, not for one who is unconcentrated. (7) This Dhamma is for one who is wise, not for one who is unwise."

The Blessed One knew with his own mind the course of thought in the Venerable Anuruddha's mind. Then, just as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, the Blessed One disappeared from among the Bhaggas at Sumsumāragira, in the deer park at Bhesakalā Grove, and reappeared before the Venerable Anuruddha among the Cetis in the eastern bamboo park. The Blessed One sat down on the seat prepared for him. The Venerable Anuruddha then paid homage to him and sat down to one side, and the Blessed One said to him: "Good, good, Anuruddha! It is good that you have reflected on these thoughts of a great person, namely: 'This Dhamma is for one with few desires, not for one with strong desires.... This Dhamma is for one who is wise, not for one who is unwise.' Therefore, Anuruddha, also reflect on this
eighth thought of a great person: (8) 'This Dhamma is for one who delights in non-proliferation, who takes delight in nonproliferation, not for one who delights in proliferation, who takes delight in proliferation. ${ }^{1693}$

"When, Anuruddha, you reflect on these eight thoughts of a great person, then, as much as you wish, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, [230] you will enter and dwell in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination.

"When you reflect on these eight thoughts of a great person, then, as much as you wish, with the subsiding of thought and examination, you will enter and dwell in the second jhāna, which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration, without thought and examination.

"When you reflect on these eight thoughts of a great person, then, as much as you wish, with the fading away as well of rapture, you will dwell equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, experience pleasure with the body; you will enter and dwell in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: 'He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.'

"When you reflect on these eight thoughts of a great person, then, as much as you wish, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and sadness, you will enter and dwell in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity.

"When, Anuruddha, you reflect upon these eight thoughts of a great person and gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, these four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life, then, while you dwell contentedly, your rag-robe will seem to you as a chest full of variously colored garments seems to a householder or a householder's son; and it will serve for your delight, relief, and ease, and for entering upon nibbāna. [231]

"When you reflect upon these eight thoughts of a great person and gain at will ... these four jhānas... then, while you dwell contentedly, your scraps of almsfood will seem to you as a dish of rice cleaned of black grains and served with many
gravies and curries seems to a householder or a householder's son; and they will serve for your delight, relief, and ease, and for entering upon nibbāna.

"When you reflect upon these eight thoughts of a great person and gain at will ... these four jhānas ... then, while you dwell contentedly, your dwelling place at the foot of a tree will seem to you as a house with a peaked roof, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with bolts fastened and shutters closed, seems to a householder or a householder's son; and it will serve for your delight, relief, and ease, and for entering upon nibbāna.

"When you reflect upon those eight thoughts of a great person and gain at will ... these four jhānas ... then, while you dwell contentedly, your bed and seat made of straw will seem to you as a couch spread with rugs, blankets, and covers, with an excellent covering of antelope hide, with a canopy above and red bolsters at both ends, seems to a householder or a householder's son; and it will serve for your delight, relief, and ease, and for entering upon nibbāna. [232]

"When you reflect upon these eight thoughts of a great person and gain at will ... these four jhānas ... then, while you dwell contentedly, your medicine of fermented cow's urine will seem to you as various medicaments of ghee, butter, oil, honey, and molasses seem to a householder or a householder's son; and it will serve for your delight, relief, and ease, and for entering upon nibbāna.

"Therefore, Anuruddha, you should also spend the next rains residence right here among the Cetis in the eastern bamboo park."

"Yes, Bhante," the Venerable Anuruddha replied.

Then, having exhorted the Venerable Anuruddha, just as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, the Blessed One disappeared before the Venerable Anuruddha among the Cetis in the eastern bamboo park and reappeared among the Bhaggas at Sumsumāragira, in the deer park at Bhesakalā Grove. He then sat down on the seat prepared for him and addressed the bhikkhus: "I will teach you, bhikkhus, the eight thoughts of a great person. Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:
"And what, bhikkhus, are the eight thoughts of a great person? (1) This Dhamma is for one with few desires, not for one with strong desires. (2) This Dhamma is for one who is content, not for one who is discontent. (3) This Dhamma is for one who resorts to solitude, not for one who delights in company. (4) This Dhamma is for one who is energetic, not for one who is lazy. (5) This Dhamma is for one with mindfulness established, not for one who is muddle-minded. (6) This Dhamma is for one who is concentrated, not for one who is unconcentrated. (7) This Dhamma is for one who is wise, [233] not for one who is unwise. (8) This Dhamma is for one who delights in non-proliferation, who takes delight in non-proliferation, not for one who delights in proliferation, who takes delight in proliferation:

(1) "When it was said: 'This Dhamma is for one with few desires, not for one with strong desires,' with reference to what was this said? Here, when a bhikkhu is one with few desires, he does not desire: 'Let people know me to be one with few desires.' When he is content, he does not desire: 'Let people know me to be one who is content.' When he resorts to solitude, he does not desire: 'Let people know me to be one who resorts to solitude.' When he is energetic, he does not desire: 'Let people know me to be energetic.' When he is mindful, he does not desire: 'Let people know me to be mindful.' When he is concentrated, he does not desire: 'Let people know me to be concentrated.' When he is wise, he does not desire: 'Let people know me to be wise.' When he delights in non-proliferation, he does not desire: 'Let people know me to be one who delights in non-proliferation.' When it was said: 'This Dhamma is for one with few desires, not for one with strong desires,' it is with reference to this that this was said.

(2) "When it was said: 'This Dhamma is for one who is content, not for one who is discontent,' with reference to what was this said? Here, a bhikkhu is content with any kind of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick. When it was said: 'This Dhamma is for one who is content, not for one who is discontent,' it is with reference to this that this was said.

(3) "When it was said: 'This Dhamma is for one who resorts to solitude, not for one who delights in company,' with reference to what was this said? Here, when a bhikkhu resorts to solitude,
bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, male lay followers, female lay followers, kings, royal ministers, heads of other sects, and disciples belonging to other sects approach him. In each case, with a mind that slants, slopes, and inclines to seclusion, withdrawn, ${ }^{1694}$ delighting in renunciation, he gives them a talk invariably concerned with dismissing them. [234] When it was said: 'This Dhamma is for one who resorts to solitude, not for one who delights in company,' it is with reference to this that this was said.

(4) "When it was said: 'This Dhamma is for one who is energetic, not for one who is lazy,' with reference to what was this said? Here, a bhikkhu has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities. When it was said: 'This Dhamma is for one who is energetic, not for one who is lazy,' it is with reference to this that this was said.

(5) "When it was said: 'This Dhamma is for one with mindfulness established, not for one who is muddle-minded,' with reference to what was this said? Here, a bhikkhu is mindful, possessing supreme mindfulness and alertness, one who remembers and recollects what was done and said long ago. When it was said: 'This Dhamma is for one with mindfulness established, not for one who is muddle-minded,' it is with reference to this that this was said.

(6) "When it was said: 'This Dhamma is for one who is concentrated, not for one who is unconcentrated,' with reference to what was this said? Here, secluded from sensual pleasures . . . a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna. When it was said: 'This Dhamma is for one who is concentrated, not for one who is unconcentrated,' it is with reference to this that this was said.

(7) "When it was said: 'This Dhamma is for one who is wise, not for one who is unwise,' with reference to what was this said? Here, a bhikkhu is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. When it was said: 'This Dhamma is for one who is wise, not for one who is unwise,' it is with reference to this that this was said. [235]

(8) "When it was said: 'This Dhamma is for one who delights in non-proliferation, who takes delight in non-proliferation, not for one who delights in proliferation, who takes delight in proliferation,' with reference to what was this said? Here, a bhik-
khu's mind launches out upon the cessation of proliferation, becomes placid, settles down, and is liberated in it. When it was said: "This Dhamma is for one who delights in non-proliferation, who takes delight in non-proliferation, not for one who delights in proliferation, who takes delight in proliferation,' it is with reference to this that this was said."

Then the Venerable Anuruddha spent the next rains residence right there among the Cetis in the eastern bamboo park. Dwelling alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute, in no long time the Venerable Anuruddha realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having entered upon it, he dwelled in it. He directly knew: "Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being." And the Venerable Anuruddha became one of the arahants.

On that occasion, when he had attained arahantship, the Venerable Anúruddha spoke these verses: ${ }^{1695}$

"Having understood my thoughts, the unsurpassed teacher in the world came to me by psychic potency in a mind-made body.

"He taught me more than my thoughts contained: the Buddha, delighting in non-proliferation, instructed me in non-proliferation.

"Having learned his Dhamma, I delighted in his teaching.

I have gained the three true knowledges;

the Buddha's teaching has been done." [236]

# IV. Giving

## 31 (1) Giving (1)

"Bhikkhus, there are these eight gifts. ${ }^{1696}$ What eight? (1) Having insulted [the recipient], one gives a gift. ${ }^{1697}$ (2) One gives a gift from fear. (3) One gives a gift, [thinking]: 'He gave to me.' (4)

One gives a gift, [thinking]: 'He will give to me.' (5) One gives a gift, [thinking]: 'Giving is good.' (6) One gives a gift, [thinking]: 'I cook; these people do not cook. It isn't right that I who cook should not give to those who do not cook.' (7) One gives a gift, [thinking]: 'Because I have given this gift, I will gain a good reputation.' (8) One gives a gift for the purpose of ornamenting the mind, equipping the mind."1698

# 32 (2) Giving (2) ${ }^{1699}$

Faith, moral shame, and wholesome giving are qualities pursued by the good person; for this, they say, is the divine path by which one goes to the world of the devas.

## 33 (3) Grounds

"Bhikkhus, there are these eight grounds for giving. ${ }^{1700}$ What eight? (1) One gives a gift from desire. (2) One gives a gift from hatred. (3) One gives a gift from delusion. (4) One gives a gift from fear. ${ }^{1701}$ (5) One gives a gift, [thinking]: 'Giving was practiced before by my father and forefathers; I should not abandon this ancient family custom.' (6) One gives a gift, [thinking]: 'Having given this gift, with the breakup of the body, after death, I will be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.' (7) One gives a gift, [thinking]: 'When I am giving this gift my mind becomes placid, [237] and elation and joy arise.' (8) One gives a gift for the purpose of ornamenting the mind, equipping the mind. These are the eight grounds for giving."

## 34 (4) The Field

"Bhikkhus, a seed sown in a field that possesses eight factors does not bring forth abundant fruits, its [fruits] are not delectable, and it does not yield a profit. What eight factors?

"Here, (1) the field has mounds and ditches; (2) it contains stones and gravel; (3) it is salty; (4) it is not decply furrowed; (5) it does not have inlets [for the water to enter]; (6) it does not have outlets [for excess water to flow out]; (7) it does not have irrigation channels; and (8) it does not have boundaries. A seed sown in a field that possesses these eight factors does not bring forth abundant fruits, its [fruits] are not delectable, and it does not yield a profit.
"So too, bhikkhus, a gift given to ascetics and brahmins who possess eight factors is not of great fruit and benefit, and it is not very brilliant or pervasive. What eight factors? Here, the ascetics and brahmins are of wrong view, wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong concentration. A gift given to ascetics and brahmins who possess these eight factors is not of great fruit and benefit, and it is not very brilliant or pervasive.

"Bhikkhus, a seed sown in a field that possesses eight factors brings forth abundant fruits, its [fruits] are delectable, and it yields a profit. What eight factors?

"Here, (1) the field does not have mounds and ditches; (2) it does not contain stones and gravel; (3) it is not salty; (4) it is deeply [238] furrowed; (5) it has inlets [for the water to enter]; (6) it has outlets [for excess water to flow out]; (7) it has irrigation channels; and (8) it has boundaries. A seed sown in a field that possesses these eight factors brings forth abundant fruits, its [fruits] are delectable, and it yields a profit.

"So too, bhikkhus, a gift given to ascetics and brahmins who possess eight factors is of great fruit and benefit, and it is extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive. What eight factors? Here, the ascetics and brahmins are of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. A gift given to ascetics and brahmins who possess these eight factors is of great fruit and benefit, and it is extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive."

When the field is excellent, and the seed sown is excellent, and there is an excellent supply of rain, the yield of grain is excellent. ${ }^{1702}$

Its health is excellent;

its growth [too] is excellent;

its maturation is excellent;

its fruit truly is excellent.

So too when one gives excellent food to those accomplished in virtuous behavior, it arrives at several kinds of excellence, for what one has done is excellent.

Therefore if one desires excellence let a person here be accomplished; one should resort to those accomplished in wisdom; thus one's own accomplishments flourish.

One accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, having gained accomplishment of mind, performs action that is accomplished and accomplishes the good.

Having known the world as it is, one should attain accomplishment in view. One accomplished in mind advances by relying on accomplishment in the path. [239]

Having rubbed off all stains, having attained nibbāna, one is then freed from all sufferings: this is total accomplishment.

35 (5) Rebirth on Account of Giving

"Bhikkhus, there are these eight kinds of rebirth on account of giving. What eight?

(1) "Here, someone gives a gift to an ascetic or a brahmin: food and drink; clothing and vehicles; garlands, scents, and unguents; bedding, dwellings, and lighting. Whatever he gives, he expects something in return. He sees affluent khattiyas, affluent brahmins, or affluent householders enjoying themselves furnished and endowed with the five objects of sensual pleasure. It occurs to him: 'Oh, with the breakup of the body, after death, may I be reborn in companionship with affluent khattiyas, affluent brahmins, or affluent householders!' He sets his mind on this, fixes his mind on this, and develops this state of mind. That aspiration of his, ${ }^{1703}$ resolved on what is inferior, ${ }^{1704}$ not developed higher, leads to rebirth there. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with affluent khattiyas, affluent brahmins, or affluent householders-and that is for one who is virtuous, I say, not for one who is immoral. The heart's wish of one who is virtuous succeeds because of his purity.
(2) "Someone else gives a gift to an ascetic or a brahmin: food and drink . . . and lighting. Whatever he gives, he expects something in return. He has heard: 'The devas [ruled by] the four great kings [240] are long-lived, beautiful, and abound in happiness.' It occurs to him: 'Oh, with the breakup of the body, after death, may I be reborn in companionship with the devas [ruled by] the four great kings!' He sets his mind on this, fixes his mind on this, and develops this state of mind. That aspiration of his, resolved on what is inferior, not developed higher, leads to rebirth there. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with the devas [ruled by] the four great kings-and that is for one who is virtuous, I say, not for one who is immoral. The heart's wish of one who is virtuous succeeds because of his purity.

(3)-(7) "Someone else gives a gift to an ascetic or a brahmin: food and drink . . . and lighting. Whatever he gives, he expects something in return. He has heard: 'The Tâvatimsa devas . . . the Yâma devas . . . the Tusita devas . . . the devas who delight in creation... the devas who control what is created by others are long-lived, beautiful, and abound in happiness.' It occurs to him: 'Oh, with the breakup of the body, after death, may I be reborn in companionship with the devas who control what is created by others!' He sets his mind on this, fixes his mind on this, and develops this state of mind. That aspiration of his, resolved on what is inferior, not developed higher, leads to rebirth there. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with the devas who control what is created by others-and that is for one who is virtuous, I say, not for one who is immoral. The heart's wish of one who is virtuous succeeds because of his purity.

(8) "Someone else gives a gift to an ascetic or a brahmin: food and drink ... and lighting. Whatever he gives, he expects something in return. He has heard: 'The devas of Brahmā's company [241] are long-lived, beautiful, and abound in happiness.' It occurs to him: 'Oh, with the breakup of the body, after death, may I be reborn in companionship with the devas of Brahmā's company!' He sets his mind on this, fixes his mind on this, and develops this state of mind. That aspiration of his, resolved on what is inferior, not developed higher, leads to rebirth there. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with the
devas of Brahmā's company-and that is for one who is virtuous, I say, not for one who is immoral; for one without lust, not for one with lust. ${ }^{1705}$ The heart's wish of one who is virtuous succeeds because of his purity.

"These, bhikkhus, are the eight kinds of rebirth on account of giving."

# 36 (6) Activity

"Bhikkhus, there are these three bases of meritorious activity. What three? The basis of meritorious activity consisting in giving; the basis of meritorious activity consisting in virtuous behavior; and the basis of meritorious activity consisting in meditative development.

(1) "Here, bhikkhus, someone has practiced the basis of meritorious activity consisting in giving to a limited extent; he has practiced the basis of meritorious activity consisting in virtuous behavior to a limited extent; but he has not undertaken the basis of meritorious activity consisting in meditative development. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn among humans in an unfavorable condition.

(2) "Someone else has practiced the basis of meritorious activity consisting in giving to a middling extent; he has practiced the basis of meritorious activity consisting in virtuous behavior to a middling extent; but he has not undertaken the basis of meritorious activity consisting in meditative development. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn among humans in a favorable condition.

(3) "Someone else has practiced the basis of meritorious activity consisting in giving to a superior extent; he has practiced the basis of meritorious activity consisting in virtuous behavior [242] to a superior extent; but he has not undertaken the basis of meritorious activity consisting in meditative development. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with the devas [ruled by] the four great kings. There the four great kings, who had practiced superlatively the basis of meritorious activity consisting in giving and the basis of meritorious activity consisting in virtuous behavior surpass the devas [ruled by] the four great kings in teri respects: in celestial life span, celestial beauty, celestial happiness, celestial glory, and celestial authority; and in celestial forms, sounds, odors, tastes, and tactile objects.
(4) "Someone else has practiced the basis of meritorious activity consisting in giving to a superior extent; he has practiced the basis of meritorious activity consisting in virtuous behavior to a superior extent; but he has not undertaken the basis of meritorious activity consisting in meditative development. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with the Tāvatimsa devas. There Sakka, ruler of the devas, who had practiced superlatively the basis of meritorious activity consisting in giving and the basis of meritorious activity consisting in virtuous behavior, surpasses the Tāvatimsa devas in ten respects: in celestial life span . . . and tactile objects.

(5) "Someone else has practiced the basis of meritorious activity consisting in giving to a superior extent; he has practiced the basis of meritorious activity consisting in virtuous behavior to a superior extent; but he has not undertaken the basis of meritorious activity consisting in meditative development. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with the Yāma devas. There the young deva Suyāma, who had practiced superlatively the basis of meritorious activity consisting in giving and the basis of meritorious activity consisting in virtuous behavior, surpasses the Yāma devas in ten respects: in celestial life span . . . and tactile objects.

(6) "Someone else has practiced the basis of meritorious activity consisting in giving to a superior extent; he has practiced the basis of meritorious activity consisting in virtuous behavior to a superior extent; but he has not undertaken the basis of meritorious activity consisting in meditative development. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with the Tusita devas. [243] There the young deva Santusita, who had practiced superlatively the basis of meritorious activity consisting in giving and the basis of meritorious activity consisting in virtuous behavior, surpasses the Tusita devas in ten respects: in celestial life span... and tactile objects.

(7) "Someone else has practiced the basis of meritorious activity consisting in giving to a superior extent; he has practiced the basis of meritorious activity consisting in virtuous behavior to a superior extent; but he has not undertaken the basis of meritorious activity consisting in meditative development. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with the devas who delight in creation. There the young deva Sunimmita, who had practiced superlatively the basis of
meritorious activity consisting in giving and the basis of meritorious activity consisting in virtuous behavior, surpasses the devas who delight in creation in ten respects: in celestial life span ... and tactile objects.

(8) "Someone else has practiced the basis of meritorious activity consisting in giving to a superior extent; he has practiced the basis of meritorious activity consisting in virtuous behavior to a superior extent; but he has not undertaken the basis of meritorious activity consisting in meditative development. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with the devas who control what is created by others. There the young deva Vasavatti, who had practiced superlatively the basis of meritorious activity consisting in giving and the basis of meritorious activity consisting in virtuous behavior, surpasses the devas who control what is created by others in ten respects: in celestial life span, celestial beauty, celestial happiness, celestial glory, and celestial authority; and in celestial forms, sounds, odors, tastes, and tactile objects.

"These, bhikkhus, are the three bases of meritorious activity."

# 37 (7) The Good Person's Gifts

"Bhikkhus, there are these eight gifts of a good person. ${ }^{1706}$ What eight? [244] (1) He gives what is pure; (2) he gives what is excellent; (3) he gives a timely gift; (4) he gives what is allowable; (5) he gives after investigation; (6) he gives often; (7) while giving he settles his mind in confidence; and (8) having given, he is elated. These are the eight gifts of a good person."

He gives what is pure and excellent, allowable drinks and food at the proper time; he gives gifts often to fertile fields of merit, to those who lead the spiritual life.

He does not feel regret, having given away many material things.

Those with deep insight praise

the gifts given in this way.

Having thus practiced charity

with a mind freely generous,
one intelligent and wise, rich in faith, is reborn in a pleasant, unafflicted world.

38 (8) The Good Person ${ }^{1707}$

"Bhikkhus, when a good person is born in a family, it is for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people. It is for the good, welfare, and happiness of (1) his mother and father, (2) his wife and children, (3) his slaves, workers, and servants, (4) his friends and companions, (5) his departed ancestors, (6) the king, (7) the deities, and (8) ascetics and brahmins. Just as a great rain cloud, nurturing all the crops, appears for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people, so too, when a good person is born in a family, it is for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people. It is for the good, welfare, and happiness of his mother and father...[245]... ascetics and brahmins."

The wise person, dwelling at home, truly lives for the good of many.

Day and night diligent toward

his mother, father, and ancestors, ${ }^{1708}$

he venerates them in accordance with the Dhamma, recollecting what they did [for him] in the past. ${ }^{1709}$

Firm in faith, the pious man, having known their good qualities, ${ }^{1710}$ venerates the homeless renouncers, the mendicants who lead the spiritual life. ${ }^{1711}$

Beneficial to the king and the devas, beneficial to his relatives and friends, indeed, beneficial to all, well established in the good Dhamma, he has removed the stain of miserliness and fares on to an auspicious world.

39 (9) Streams

"Bhikkhus, there are these eight streams of merit, streams of the wholesome, nutriments of happiness-heavenly, ripening in happiness, conducive to heaven-that lead to what is wished for, desired, and agreeable, to one's welfare and happiness. ${ }^{1712}$ What eight?
(1) "Here, a noble disciple has gone for refuge to the Buddha. This is the first stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, nutriment of happiness-heavenly, ripening in happiness, conducive to heaven-that leads to what is wished for, desired, and agreeable, to one's welfare and happiness.

(2) "Again, a noble disciple has gone for refuge to the Dhamma. This is the second stream of merit . . . that leads to what is wished for, desired, and agreeable, to one's welfare and happiness.

(3) "Again, a noble disciple has gone for refuge to the Sangha. This is the third stream of merit . . . that leads to what is wished for, desired, and agreeable, to one's welfare and happiness. [246]

"There are, bhikkhus, these five gifts, great gifts, primal, of long standing, traditional, ancient, unadulterated and never before adulterated, which are not being adulterated and will not be adulterated, not repudiated by wise ascetics and brahmins. What five?

(4) "Here, a noble disciple, having abandoned the destruction of life, abstains from the destruction of life. By abstaining from the destruction of life, the noble disciple gives to an immeasurable number of beings freedom from fear, enmity, and affliction. He himself in turn enjoys immeasurable freedom from fear, enmity, and affliction. This is the first gift, a great gift, primal, of long standing, traditional, ancient, unadulterated and never before adulterated, which is not being adulterated and will not be adulterated, not repudiated by wise ascetics and brahmins. This is the fourth stream of merit... that leads to what is wished for, desired, and agreeable, to one's welfare and happiness.

(5)-(8) "Again, a noble disciple, having abandoned the taking of what is not given, abstains from taking what is not given . . . abstains from sexual misconduct . . . abstains from false speech . . . abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. By abstaining from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, the noble disciple gives to an immeasurable number of beings freedom from fear, enmity, and affliction. I Ie himself in turn enjoys immeasurable freedom from fear, enmity, and affliction. This is the fifth gift, a great gift, primal, of long standing, traditional, ancient, unadulterated and never before adulterated, which is not-being adulterated
and will not be adulterated, not repudiated by wise ascetics and brahmins. This is the eighth stream of merit [247] . . that leads to what is wished for, desired, and agreeable, to one's welfare and happiness.

"These, bhikkhus, are the eight streams of merit, streams of the wholesome, nutriments of happiness-heavenly, ripening in happiness, conducive to heaven-that lead to what is wished for, desired, and agreeable, to one's welfare and happiness."

# 40 (10) Conducive

(1) "Bhikkhus, the destruction of life, repeatedly pursued, developed, and cultivated, is conducive to hell, to the animal realm, and to the sphere of afflicted spirits; for one reborn as a human being the destruction of life at minimum conduces to a short life span.

(2) "Taking what is not given, repeatedly pursued, developed, and cultivated, is conducive to hell, to the animal realm, and to the sphere of afflicted spirits; for one reborn as a human being taking what is not given at minimum conduces to loss of wealth.

(3) "Sexual misconduct, repeatedly pursued, developed, and cultivated, is conducive to hell, to the animal realm, and to the sphere of afflicted spirits; for one reborn as a human being sexual misconduct at minimum conduces to enmity and rivalry.

(4) "False speech, repeatedly pursued, developed, and cultivated, is conducive to hell, to the animal realm, and to the sphere of afflicted spirits; for one reborn as a human being false speech at minimum conduces to false accusations.

(5) "Divisive speech, repeatedly pursued, developed, and cultivated, is conducive to hell, to the animal realm, and to the sphere of afflicted spirits; for one reborn as a human being divisive speech at minimum conduces to being divided from one's friends. [248]

(6) "Harsh speech, repeatedly pursued, developed, and cultivated, is conducive to hell, to the animal realm, and to the sphere of afflicted spirits; for one reborn as a human being harsh speech at minimum conduces to disagreeable sounds.

(7) "Idle chatter, repeatedly pursued, developed, and cultivated, is conducive to hell, to the animal realm, and to the sphere of afflicted spirits; for one reborn as a human being idle chatter at minimum conduces to others distrusting one's words.
(8) "Drinking liquor and wine, repeatedly pursued, developed, and cultivated, is conducive to hell, to the animal realm, and to the sphere of afflicted spirits; for one reborn as a human being drinking liquor and wine at minimum conduces to madness."

# V. UPOSATHA

## 41 (1) In Brief

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, observed complete in eight factors, the uposatha is of great fruit and benefit, extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive. And how is the uposatha observed complete in eight factors, so that it is of great fruit and benefit, extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive? ${ }^{1733}$ [249]

(1) "Here, bhikkhus, a noble disciple reflects thus: 'As long as they live the arahants abandon and abstain from the destruction of life; with the rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious and kindly, they dwell compassionate toward all living beings. Today, for this night and day, I too shall abandon and abstain from the destruction of life; with the rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious and kindly, I too shall dwell compassionate toward all living beings. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.' This is the first factor it possesses.

(2) "'As long as they live the arahants abandon and abstain from taking what is not given; they take only what is given, expect only what is given, and dwell honestly without thoughts of theft. Today, for this night and day, I too shall abandon and abstain from taking what is not given; I shall accept only what is given, expect only what is given, and dwell honestly without thoughts of theft. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.' This is the second factor it possesses.

(3) "'As long as they live the arahants abandon sexual activity and observe celibacy, living apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the common person's practice. Today, for this night and
day, I too shall abandon sexual activity and observe celibacy, living apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the common person's practice. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.' This is the third factor it possesses.

(4) "'As long as they live the arahants abandon and abstain from false speech; they speak truth, adhere to truth; they are trustworthy and reliable, no deceivers of the world. Today, for this night and day, I too shall abandon and abstain from false speech; [250] I shall speak truth, adhere to truth; I shall be trustworthy and reliable, no deceiver of the world. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.' This is the fourth factor it possesses.

(5) "'As long as they live the arahants abandon and abstain from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Today, for this night and day, I too shall abandon and abstain from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.' This is the fifth factor it possesses.

(6) "'As long as they live the arahants eat once a day, abstaining from eating at night and from food outside the proper time. Today, for this night and day, I too shall eat once a day, abstaining from eating at night and from food outside the proper time. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.' This is the sixth factor it possesses.

(7) "'As long as they live the arahants abstain from dancing, singing, instrumental music, and unsuitable shows, and from adorning and beautifying themselves by wearing garlands and applying scents and unguents. Today, for this night and day, I too shall abstain from dancing, singing, instrumental music, and unsuitable shows, and from adorning and beautifying myself by wearing garlands and applying scents and unguents. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.' This is the seventh factor it possesses.

(8) "'As long as they live the arahants abandon and abstain from the use of high and luxurious beds; they lie down on a low resting place, either a small bed or a straw mat. Today, for this night and day, I too shall abandon and abstain from the use of high and luxurious beds; I shall lie down on a low resting place, either a small bed or a straw mat. I shall imitate the arahants
in this respect [251] and the uposatha will be observed by me.' This is the eighth factor it possesses.

"It is in this way, bhikkhus, that the uposatha is observed complete in eight factors, so that it is of great fruit and benefit, extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive."

# 42 (2) In Detail

"Bhikkhus, observed complete in eight factors, the uposatha is of great fruit and benefit, extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive. And how is the uposatha observed complete in eight factors, so that it is of great fruit and benefit, extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive?

(1) "Here, bhikkhus; a noble disciple reflects thus: 'As long as they live the arahants abandon and abstain from the destruction of life; with the rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious and kindly, they dwell compassionate toward all living beings. Today, for this night and day, I too shall abandon and abstain from the destruction of life; with the rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious and kindly, I too shall dwell compassionate toward all living beings. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.' This is the first factor it possesses...

[As in 8:41 down to:]...

(8) "'As long as they live the arahants abandon and abstain from the use of high and luxurious beds; they lie down on a low resting place, either a small bed or a straw mat. Today, for this night and day, I too shall abandon and abstain from the use of high and luxurious beds; I shall lie down on a low resting place, either a small bed or a straw mat. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.' This is the eighth factor it possesses.

"It is in this way, bhikkhus, that the uposatha is_observed complete in eight factors, so that it is of great fruit and benerit, extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive. [252]

"To what extent is it of great fruit and benefir? To what extent is it extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive? Suppose one were to exercise sovereignty and kingship over these sixteen great countries abounding in the seven precious substances, that is, [the countries of] the Angans, the Magadhans, the Kāsis, the Kosalans, the Vajjis, the Mallas, the Cetis, the Vangas, the Kurus, the Pañcālas, the Macchas, the Sūrasenas, the Assakas,
the Avantis, the Gandhärans, and the Kambojans: this would not be worth a sixteenth part of the uposatha observance complete in those eight factors. For what reason? Because human kingship is poor compared to celestial happiness.

"For the devas [ruled by] the four great kings, a single night and day is equivalent to fifty human years; thirty such days make up a month, and twelve such months make up a year. The life span of those devas is five hundred such celestial years. It is possible, bhikkhus, for a woman or man who observes the uposatha complete in these eight factors; with the breakup of the body, after death, to be reborn in companionship with the devas [ruled by] the four great kings. It was with reference to this that I said human kingship is poor compared to celestial happiness.

"For the Tāvatimsa devas, a single night and day is equivalent to a hundred human years; thirty such days make up a month, and twelve such months make up a year. The life span of those devas is a thousand such celestial years. [253] It is possible, bhikkhus, for a woman or man who observes the uposatha complete in these eight factors, with the breakup of the body, after death, to be reborn in companionship with the Tāvatimsa devas. It was with reference to this that I said human kingship is poor compared to celestial happiness.

"For the Yāma devas, a single night and day is equivalent to two hundred human years; thirty such days make up a month, and twelve such months make up a year. The life span of those devas is two thousand such celestial years. It is possible, bhikkhus, for a woman or man who observes the uposatha complete in these eight factors, with the breakup of the body, after death, to be reborn in companionship with the Yāma devas. It was with reference to this that I said human kingship is poor compared to celestial happiness.

"For the Tusita devas, a single night and day is equivalent to four hundred human years; thirty such days make up a month, and twelve such months make up a year. The life span of those devas is four thousand such celestial years. It is possible, bhikkhus, for a woman or man who observes the uposatha complete in these eight factors, with the breakup of the body, after death, to be reborn in companionship with the Tusita devas. It was with reference to this that I said human kingship is poor compared to celestial happiness.

"For the devas who delight in creation, a single night and day
is equivalent to eight hundred human years; thirty such days make up a month, and twelve such months make up a year. The life span of those devas is eight thousand such celestial years. It is possible, bhikkhus, for a woman or man [254] who observes the uposatha complete in these eight factors, with the breakup of the body, after death, to be reborn in companionship with the devas who delight in creation. It was with reference to this that I said human kingship is poor compared to celestial happiness.

"For the devas who control what is created by others, a single night and day is equivalent to sixteen hundred human years; thirty such days make up a month, and twelve such months make up a year. The life span of those devas is sixteen thousand such celestial years. It is possible, bhikkhus, for a woman or man who observes the uposatha complete in these eight factors, with the breakup of the body, after death, to be reborn in companionship with the devas who control what is created by others: It was with reference to this that I said human kingship is poor compared to celestial happiness."

One should not kill living beings or take what is not given; ${ }^{1714}$

one should not speak falsehood or drink intoxicants; one should refrain from sexual activity, from unchastity;

one should not eat at night or at an improper time.

One should not wear garlands or apply scents; one should sleep on a [low] bed or a mat on the ground; this, they say, is the eight-factored uposatha proclaimed by the Buddha, who reached the end of suffering.

As far as the sun and moon revolve, shedding light, so beautiful to gaze upon, dispellers of darkness, moving through the firmament, they shine in the sky, brightening up the quarters. [255]

Whatever wealth exists in this sphere-pearls, gems, and excellent beryl, horn gold and mountain gold, and the natural gold called hataka-
those are not worth a sixteenth part of an uposatha complete in the eight factors, just as all the hosts of stars

[do not match] the moon's radiance.

Therefore a virtuous woman or man, having observed the uposatha complete in eight factors and having made merit productive of happiness, blameless goes to a heavenly state.

# 43 (3) Visākha (1)

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Migāramātā's Mansion in the Eastern Park. Then Visākhā Migāramātā approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to her:

"Visākhā, observed complete in eight factors, the uposatha is of great fruit and benefit, extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive. And how is the uposatha observed complete in eight factors, so that it is of great fruit and benefit, extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive?"

[All as in 8:42, including the verses.] [256-258]

## 44 (4) Vāseṭtha

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesāli in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then the male lay follower Vāseṭṭha approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Vāseṭṭha, observed complete in eight factors, the uposatha is of great fruit and benefit, extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive. And how is the uposatha observed complete in eight factors, so that it is of great fruit and benefit, extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive?"

[All as in 8:42, including the verses.]

When this was said, the male lay follower Vāseṭtha said to the Blessed One: [259] "Bhante, if my beloved relatives and family members would observe the uposatha complete in eight factors, that would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time. If all khattiyas would observe the uposatha complete in eight factors, that would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time. If all brahmins ... vessas ... suddas would observe
the uposatha complete in eight factors, that would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time."

"So it is, Vāseṭtha, so it is! If all khattiyas would observe the uposatha complete in eight factors, that would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time. If all brahmins . . . vessas . . . suddas would observe the uposatha complete in eight factors, that would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time. If the world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, would observe the uposatha complete in eight factors, that would lead to the welfare and happiness of the world for a long time. If these great sal trees would observe the uposatha complete in eight factors, that would lead to the welfare and happiness of these great sal trees for a long time, [if they could choose]. ${ }^{1715}$ How much more then for a human being!"

# 45 (5) Bojjhā

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇ̣ika's Park. Then the female lay follower Bojjhā approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to her:

"Bojjhā, observed complete in eight factors, the uposatha is of great fruit and benefit, extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive...." [260]

[All as in 8:42, including the verses.] [261-62]

## 46 (6) Anuruddha

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita's Park. Now on that occasion the Venerable Anuruddha had gone off to pass the day and was in seclusion when a number of agreeable-bodied deities approached him, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and said to him: ${ }^{1716}$

"Bhante Anuruddha, we [263] agreeable-bodied deities exert mastery and exercise control over three things. We immediately acquire whatever color we want. We immediately acquire whatever pleasure we want. And we immediately acquire whatever voice we want. We agreeable-bodied deities exert mastery and exercise control over these three things."

Then the Venerable Anuruddha thought: "May all these deities become blue, of blue complexion, with blue clothes and
blue ornaments." Having known the Venerable Anuruddha's thought, those deities all became blue, of blue complexion, with blue clothes and blue ornaments. Then the Venerable Anuruddha thought: "May all these deities become yellow ... red . . . white, of white complexion, with white clothes and white ornaments." Having known the Venerable Anuruddha's thought, those deities all became white, of white complexion, with white clothes and white ornaments.

Then one of those deities sang, one danced, and one snapped her fingers. Just as, when a musical quintet is well trained and its rhythm well coordinated, ${ }^{1717}$ and it is composed of skilled musicians, its music is exquisite, tantalizing, lovely, captivating, and intoxicating, [264] just so those deities' performance was exquisite, tantalizing, lovely, captivating, and intoxicating. Thereupon the Venerable Anuruddha drew in his sense faculties. Then those deities, [thinking:] "Master Anuruddha is not enjoying [this]," disappeared right on the spot. ${ }^{1718}$

Then, in the evening, the Venerable Anuruddha emerged from seclusion and approached the Blessed One. He paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side, and said to him: "Here, Bhante, I had gone off to pass the day and was in seclusion... [He reports everything that happened down to:] [265]... Then those deities, [thinking:] 'Master Anuruddha is not enjoying [this],' disappeared right on the spot.

"Bhante, how many qualities should a woman possess so that, with the breakup of the body, after death, she is reborn in companionship with the agreeable-bodied deities?"

"If she possesses eight qualities, Anuruddha, a woman, with the breakup of the body, after death, is reborn in companionship with the agreeable-bodied deities. What eight? ${ }^{1719}$

(1) "Here, Anuruddha, to whichever husband her parents give her-doing so out of a desire for her good, seeking her welfare, taking compassion on her, acting out of compassion for her-a woman rises before him and retires after him, undertaking whatever needs to be done, agreeable in her conduct and pleasing in her speech.

(2) "She honors, respects, esteems, and venerates those whom her husband respects--his mother and father, ascetics and brah-mins-and when they arrive she offers them a seat and water.

(3) "She is skillful and diligent in attending to her husband's
domestic chores, whether knitting or weaving; she possesses sound judgment about them in order to carry out and arrange them properly.

(4) "She finds out what her husband's domestic helpers [266]-whether slaves, messengers, or workers-have done and left undone; she finds out the condition of those who are ill; and she distributes to each an appropriate portion of food.

(5) "She guards and protects whatever income her husband brings home-whether money, grain, silver, or gold ${ }^{1720}$-and she is not a spendthrift, thief, wastrel, or squanderer of his earnings.

(6) "She is a female lay follower who has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha.

(7) "She is virtuous, abstaining from the destruction of life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech, and liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness.

(8) "She is generous, one who dwells at home with a heart devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in relinquishment, devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing.

"Possessing these eight qualities, Anuruddha, a woman, with the breakup of the body, after death, is reborn in companionship with the agreeable-bodied deities."

She does not despise her husband, the man who constantly supports her, who ardently and eagerly

always brings her whatever she wants. ${ }^{1721}$

Nor does a good woman scold her husband with speech caused by jealousy; ${ }^{1722}$

the wise woman shows veneration to all those whom her husband reveres.

She rises early, works diligently, manages the domestic help;

she treats her husband in agreeable ways and safeguards the wealth he earns.

The woman who fulfills her duties thus, following her husband's will and wishes,
is reborn among the devas

called "the agreeable ones." [267]

47 (7) Visākhā (2)

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Migāramātā's Mansion in the Eastern Park. Then Visākhā Migāramātā approached the Blessed One.... The Blessed One then said to her:

"Visākhā, possessing eight qualities, a woman, with the breakup of the body, after death, is reborn in companionship with the agreeable-bodied deities. What eight?"

[As in 8:46, including the verses.] [268]

48 (8) Nakula

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Bhaggas in Suṃsumāragira in the deer park at Bhesakalā Grove. Then the housewife Nakulamātā approached the Blessed One. . . The Blessed One then said to her:

"Nakulamātā, possessing eight qualities, a woman, with the breakup of the body, after death, is reborn in companionship with the agreeable-bodied deities. What eight?"

[As in 8:46, including the verses.] [269]

49 (9) The Present World (1) ${ }^{1723}$

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Migāramātā's Mansion in the Eastern Park. Then Visākhā Migāramātā approached the Blessed One.... The Blessed One then said to her:

"Visākhā, possessing four qualities, a woman is heading for victory in the present world and her life in this world succeeds. ${ }^{1724}$ What four? Here, a woman is capable at her work; she manages the domestic help; she behaves agreeably to her husband; and she safeguards his earnings.

(1) "And how, Visākhā, is a woman capable at her work? Here, a woman is skillful and diligent in attending to her husband's domestic chores, whether knitting or weaving; she possesses sound judgment about them in order to carry out and arrange them properly. It is in this way that a woman [270] is capable at her work.

(2) "And how does a woman manage the domestic help?

Here, a woman finds out what her husband's domestic helpers-whether slaves, messengers, or workers-have done and left undone; she finds out the condition of those who are ill; and she distributes to each an appropriate portion of food. It is in this way that a woman manages the domestic help.

(3) "And how does a woman behave agreeably to her husband? Here, a woman would not commit any misdeed that her husband would consider disagreeable, even at the cost of her life. It is in this way that a woman behaves agreeably to her husband.

(4) "And how does a woman safeguard his earnings? Here, a woman guards and protects whatever income her husband brings home-whether money or grain, silver or gold-and she is not a spendthrift, thief, wastrel, or squanderer of his earnings. It is in this way that a woman safeguards his earnings.

"Possessing these four qualities, a woman is heading for victory in the present world and her life in this world succeeds.

"Possessing four [other] qualities, Visākhā, a woman is heading for victory in the other world and her life in the other world succeeds. What four? Here, a woman is accomplished in faith, accomplished in virtuous behavior, accomplished in generosity, and accomplished in wisdom.

(5) "And how, Visākhā, is a woman accomplished in faith? Here, a woman is endowed with faith. She places faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' It is in this way that a woman is accomplished in faith.

(6) "And how is a woman accomplished in virtuous behavior? [271] Here, a woman abstains from the destruction of life . . . from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. It is in this way that a woman is accomplished in virtuous behavior.

(7) "And how is a woman accomplished in generosity? Here, a woman dwells at home with a heart devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in relinquishment, devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing. It is in this way that a woman is accomplished in generosity.
(8) "And how is a woman accomplished in wisdom? Here, a woman is wise; she possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. ${ }^{1725}$ It is in this way that a woman is accomplished in wisdom.

"Possessing these four qualities, Visākhā, a woman is heading for victory in the other world and her life in the other world succeeds."

Capable in attending to her work, managing the domestic help, she treats her husband in agreeable ways and safeguards the wealth he earns.

Rich in faith, possessed of virtue, charitable and devoid of miserliness, she constantly purifies the path that leads to safety in the future life.

They call any woman who has these eight qualities, virtuous, firm in Dhamma, a speaker of truth.

Accomplished in sixteen aspects, ${ }^{1726}$ complete in eight factors, such a virtuous female lay follower is reborn in an agreeable deva world.

50 (10) The Present World (2)

"Bhikkhus, possessing four qualities, a woman is heading for victory in the present world and her life in this world succeeds. What four? [272]

[What follows is identical with 8:49, inclusive of the verses, but addressed to the bhikkhus.] [273-74]

# The Second Fifty

## I. Gotamī

## 51 (1) Gotam ${ }^{1727}$

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Park. ${ }^{1728}$ Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, it would be good if women could obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata." ${ }^{1729}$

"Enough, Gotamī! Do not favor the going forth of women from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata."

A second time... A third time Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, it would be good if women could obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata."

"Enough, Gotamī! Do not favor the going forth of women from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata." ${ }^{1730}$

Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, thinking: "The Blessed One does not allow the going forth of women from the household life into homelessness," miserable and saddened, wept with a tearful face. She then paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed.

Having stayed in Kapilavatthu as long as he wanted, the Blessed One set out on tour toward Vesālī. Wandering on tour, he eventually arrived at Vesāli, where he dwelled in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood.

Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī had her hair cut off, put on ochre robes, and together with a number of Sakyan women, ${ }^{1731}$ [275] set out toward Vesālī. Eventually, she reached Vesālī and [went to] the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then, with her feet swollen and her body covered with dust, miserable and saddened, weeping with a tearful face, she stood outside the entrance. The Venerable Ānanda saw her standing there in such a condition and said to her:

"Gotamī, why are you standing outside the entrance with
your feet swollen and your body covered with dust, miserable and saddened, weeping with a tearful face?".

"I do so, Bhante Ānanda, because the Blessed One does not allow the going forth of women from the household life into homelessness."

"Well then, Gotamī, you wait right here [a moment] ${ }^{1732}$ while I ask the Blessed One to grant women the going forth."

Then the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: "Bhante, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī is standing outside the entrance with her feet swollen and her body covered with dust, miserable and saddened, weeping with a tearful face, because the Blessed One does not allow the going forth of women. Bhante; it would be good if women could obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata."

"Enough, Ānanda! Do not favor the going forth of women from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata."

A second time... A third time the Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, it would be good if women could obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata."

"Enough, Ānanda! Do not favor the going forth of women from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata." [276]

Then it occurred to the Venerable Ānanda: "The Blessed One does not allow the going forth of women from the household life into homelessness. Let me ask the Blessed One for the going forth of women in some other way."

Then the Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, if a woman were to go forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, would it be possible for her to realize the fruit of stream-entry, the fruit of once-returning, the fruit of nonreturning, and the fruit of arahantship?"

"It would be, Ānanda.

"If, Bhante, it would be possible for a woman to realize the fruit of stream-entry, the fruit of once-returning, the fruit of non-returning, and the fruit of arahantship, [and considering
that] Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī had been very helpful to the Blessed One-having been his maternal aunt, wet-nurse, and foster mother who nurtured him with breast milk when his mother died-it would be good if women could obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata."

"If, Ānanda, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī accepts eight principles of respect, ${ }^{1733}$ let that itself be her full ordination. ${ }^{1734}$

(1) "A bhikkhunī who has been ordained for a hundred years should pay homage to a bhikkhu who has been ordained that same day, should rise up for him, reverentially salute him, and behave courteously toward him. This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts. ${ }^{1735}$

(2) "A bhikkhunī should not enter upon the rains in a place where there are no bhikkhus. ${ }^{1736}$ This principle, too, should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.

(3) "Every half-month a bhikkhunī should ask the Sangha of bhikkhus about two things: about [the day] of the uposatha, and about coming for the exhortation. ${ }^{1737}$ [277] This principle, too, should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.

(4) "When a bhikkhunī has observed the rains, she should invite correction before both Sanghas in regard to three things: in regard to anything seen, heard, or suspected. ${ }^{1738}$ This principle, too, should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.

(5) "A bhikkhunī who has committed a grave offense should observe a half-month's penalty period before both Sanghas. ${ }^{1739}$ This principle, too, should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.

(6) "A probationer who has completed two years of training in the six principles should seek full ordination from both Sanghas. ${ }^{1740}$ This principle, too, should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.

(7) "A bhikkhunī must in no way insult or revile a bhikkhu. This principle, too, should be honored, respected, esteemed,
and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.

(8) "From today on, Ānanda, bhikkhunīs are prohibited from admonishing bhikkhus, but bhikkhus are not prohibited from admonishing bhikkhunīs. This principle, too, should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.

"If, Ānanda, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī accepts these eight principles of respect, let that itself be her full ordination. ${ }^{11741}$

Then the Venerable Ānanda, having learned these eight principles of respect from the Blessed One, went to Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī and said to her: "If, Gotamī, you accept eight principles of respect, that itself will be your full ordination:

(1) "A bhikkhunī who has been ordained for a hundred years should pay homage to a bhikkhu who has been ordained that same day, should rise up for him, reverentially salute him, and behave properly toward him. This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts....

(8) "From today bhikkhunīs are prohibited from admonishing bhikkhus, [278] but bhikkhus are not prohibited from admonishing bhikkhunīs. This principle, too, should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.

"If, Gotamī, you accept these eight principles of respect, that itself will be your full ordination."

"Bhante Ānanda, if a woman or a man-young, youthful, and fond of ornaments, with head bathed-obtains a garland of blue lotuses, jasmine flowers, or lilies, ${ }^{1742}$ she or he would accept it with both hands and place it on top of her or his head. In the same way, I accept these eight principles of respect as not to be transgressed as long as life lasts."

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: "Bhante, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī has accepted the eight principles of respect as things not to be transgressed as long as life lasts."

"If, Ānanda, women had not obtained the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, the spiritual life would have been of long duration; the good Dhamma would have stood firm
even for a thousand years. However, Ānanda, because women have gone forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, now the spiritual life will not be of long duration; the good Dhamma will last only five hundred years. ${ }^{1743}$

"Just as, Ānanda, prowling burglars ${ }^{1744}$ easily assail those families that have many women and few men, so in whatever Dhamma and discipline women obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness, that spiritual life does not last long.

"Just as, Ānanda, when a field of hill rice has ripened, [279] if the bleaching disease attacks it, ${ }^{1745}$ that field of hill rice does not last long, so in whatever Dhamma and discipline women obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness, that spiritual life does not last long.

"Just as, Ānanda, when a field of sugar cane has ripened, if the rusting disease attacks it, ${ }^{1746}$ that field of sugar cane does not last long, so in whatever Dhamma and discipline women obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness, that spiritual life does not last long.

"Just as, Ānanda, a man might build a dyke around a large reservoir as a precaution so that the water would not overflow, so too, as a precaution I have prescribed for bhikkhunis the eight principles of respect as things not to be transgressed as long as life lasts." ${ }^{1747}$

# 52 (2) Exhortation

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, how many qualities should a bhikkhu possess to be agreed upon as an exhorter of bhikkhunis?"1748

"Ānanda, a bhikkhu should possess eight qualities to be agreed upon as an exhorter of bhikkhunis. What eight?

(1) "Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu is virtuous. . . [as in 8:2 §4] . . . Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them.

(2) "He has learned much... [as in 8:2 §5]... and penetrated well by view.

(3) "Both Pātimokkhas have been well transmitted to him in
detail, well analyzed, well mastered, well determined in terms of the rules and their detailed explication.

(4) "He is a good speaker with a good delivery; he is gifted with speech that is polished, clear, articulate, expressive of the meaning.

(5) "He is capable [280] of instructing, encouraging, inspiring, and gladdening the Sangha of bhikkhunīs with a Dhamma talk.

(6) "He is pleasing and agreeable to most of the bhikkhunīs.

(7) "He has never before committed a grave offense against a woman wearing the ochre robe who has gone forth under the Blessed One.

(8) "He has seniority of twenty years or more.

"A bhikkhu should possess these eight qualities to be agreed upon as an exhorter of bhikkhunīs."

# 53 (3) Brief ${ }^{1749}$

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and said to him: "Bhante, it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that, having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute."

"Gotamī, those things of which you might know: 'These things lead (1) to passion, not to dispassion; (2) to bondage, not to detachment; (3) to building up, not to dismantling; (4) to strong desires, not to fewness of desires; (5) to non-contentment, not to contentment; (6) to company, not to solitude; (7) to laziness, not to the arousing of energy; (8) to being difficult to support, not to being easy to support,' you should definitely recognize: 'This is not the Dhamma; this is not the discipline; this is not the teaching of the Teacher.' But, Gotamī, those things of which you might know: 'These things lead (1) to dispassion, not to passion; (2) to detachment, not to bondage; (3) to dismantling, not to building up; (4) to fewness of desires, not to strong desires; (5) to contentment, not to non-contentment; (6) to solitude, not [281] to company; (7) to the arousing of energy, not to laziness; (8) to being easy to support, not to being difficult to support,' you should definitely recognize: 'This is the Dhamma; this is the discipline; this is the teaching of the Teacher.'"

54 (4) Dighajäṇu

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Koliyans near the Koliyan town named Kakkarapatta. There the young Koliyan Dighajānu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, we are laymen enjoying sensual pleasures, living at home in a house full of children. We use sandalwood from Kāsi; we wear garlands, scents, and unguents; we receive gold and silver. Let the Blessed One teach us the Dhamma in a way that will lead to our welfare and happiness in this present life and in future lives."

"There are, Byagghapajja, ${ }^{1720}$ these four things that lead to the welfare and happiness of a clansman in this present life. What four? Accomplishment in initiative, accomplishment in protection, good friendship, and balanced living.

(1) "And what is accomplishment in initiative? Here, whatever may be the means by which a clansman earns his livingwhether by farming, trade, raising cattle, archery, government service, or some other craft-he is skillful and diligent; he possesses sound judgment about it in order to carry out and arrange it properly. This is called accomplishment in initiative.

(2) "And what is accomplishment in protection? Here, a clansman sets up protection and guard over the wealth he has [282] acquired by initiative and energy, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained, thinking: 'How can I prevent kings and thieves from taking it, fire from burning it, floods from sweeping it off, and displeasing heirs from taking it?' This is called accomplishment in protection.

(3) "And what is good friendship? Here, in whatever village or town a clansman lives, he associates with householders or their sons-whether young but of mature virtue, or old and of mature virtue-who are accomplished in faith, virtuous behavior, generosity, and wisdom; he converses with them and engages in discussions with them. Insofar as they are accomplished in faith, he emulates them with respect to their accomplishment in faith; insofar as they are accomplished in virtuous behavior, he emulates them with respect to their accomplishment in virtuous behavior; insofar as they are accomplished in generosity, he emulates them with respect to their accomplish-
ment in generosity; insofar as they are accomplished in wisdom, he emulates them with respect to their accomplishment in wisdom. This is called good friendship.

(4) "And what is balanced living? Here, a clansman knows his income and expenditures and leads a balanced life, neither too extravagant nor too frugal, [aware]: 'In this way my income will exceed my expenditures rather than the reverse.' Just as an appraiser or his apprentice, holding up a scale, knows: 'By so much it has dipped down, by so much it has gone up,' so a clansman knows his income and expenditures and leads a balanced life, neither too extravagant nor too frugal, [aware]: 'In this way my income will exceed my expenditures [283] rather than the reverse.'

"If this clansman has a small income but lives luxuriously, others would say of him: 'This clansman eats his wealth just like an eater of figs. ${ }^{1751}$ But if he has a large income but lives sparingly, others would say of him: 'This clansman may even starve himself. ${ }^{1752}$ But it is called balanced living when a clansman knows his income and expenditures and leads a balanced life, neither too extravagant nor too frugal, [aware]: 'In this way my income will exceed my expenditures rather than the reverse.'

"The wealth thus amassed has four sources of dissipation: womanizing, drunkenness, gambling, and bad friendship, bad companionship, bad comradeship. Just as if there were a large reservoir with four inlets and four outlets, and a man would close the inlets and open the outlets, and sufficient rain does not fall, one could expect the water in the reservoir to decrease rather than increase; so the wealth thus amassed has four sources of dissipation: womanizing...bad comradeship:

"The wealth thus amassed has four sources of accretion: one avoids womanizing, drunkenness, and [284] gambling, and cultivates good friendship, good companionship, good comradeship. Just as if there were a large reservoir with four inlets and four outlets, and a man would open the inlets and close the outlets, and sufficient rain falls; one could expect the water in the reservoir to increase rather than decrease, so the wealth amassed has four sources of accretion: one avoids womanizing... and cultivates good friendship.

"These are the four things that lead to the welfare and happiness of a clansman in this very life.
"There are, Byagghapajja, these four [other] things that lead to a clansman's welfare and happiness in future lives. What four? Accomplishment in faith, accomplishment in virtuous behavior, accomplishment in generosity, and accomplishment in wisdom.

(5) "And what is accomplishment in faith? Here, a clansman is endowed with faith. He places faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant...teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' This is called accomplishment in faith.

(6) "And what is accomplishment in virtuous behavior? Here, a clansman abstains from the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. This is called accomplishment in virtuous behavior.

(7) "And what is accomplishment in generosity? Here, a clansman dwells at home with a heart devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in relinquishment, one devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing. This is called accomplishment in generosity.

(8) "And what is accomplishment in wisdom? [285] Here, a clansman is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. This is called accomplishment in wisdom.

"These are the four [other] things that lead to the welfare and happiness of a clansman in future lives."

Enterprising in his occupations, heedful in his arrangements, balanced in his way of living, he safeguards the wealth he earns.

Endowed with faith, accomplished in virtue, charitable and devoid of miserliness, he constantly purifies the path that leads to safety in future lives.

Thus these eight qualities of the faithful seeker of the household life are said by the one who is truly named ${ }^{1753}$
to lead to happiness in both states:

to good and welfare in this very life, and to happiness in future lives.

Thus for those dwelling at home, their generosity and merit increase.

Then the brahmin Ujjaya approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

"Master Gotama, I wish to go abroad. Let Master Gotama teach me the Dhamma about things that would lead to my welfare and happiness in this present life and in future lives."

[What follows is identical with 8:54, inclusive of the four verses, but addressed to the brahmin.] [286-89].

## 56 (6) Peril ${ }^{1254}$

"Bhikkhus, (1) 'peril' is a designation for sensual pleasures. (2) 'Suffering' is a designation for sensual pleasures. (3) 'Disease' is a designation for sensual pleasures. (4) 'A boil' is a designation for sensual pleasures. (5) 'A dart' is a designation for sensual pleasures. (6) 'A tie' is a designation for sensual pleasures. (7) 'A swamp' is a designation for sensual pleasures. (8) 'A womb' is a designation for sensual pleasures.

"And why, bhikkhus, is 'peril' a designation for sensual pleasures? One excited by sensual lust, bound by desire and lust, is not freed from the peril pertaining to this present life [290] or from the peril pertaining to future lives; therefore 'peril' is a designation for sensual pleasures.

"And why is 'suffering' ... 'disease' ... 'a boil' ... 'a dart' ... 'a tie' ...'a swamp' ...'a womb' a designation for sensual pleasures? One excited by sensual lust, bound by desire and lust, is not freed from the womb pertaining to this present life or from the womb pertaining to future lives; ${ }^{1255}$ therefore 'a womb' is a designation for sensual pleasures."

Peril, suffering, and disease, a boil, a dart, and a tie, a swamp and a womb:

these describe the sensual pleasures
to which the worldling is attached.

Being immersed in what is enjoyable, he again goes to the womb.

But when a bhikkhu is ardent and does not neglect clear comprehension, in such a way he transcends this miserable bog;

he surveys this trembling population that has fallen into birth and old age.

# 57 (7) Worthy of Offerings (1)

"Bhikkhus, possessing eight qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What eight?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous. . . . Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them.

(2) "He has learned much . . . and penetrated well by view.

(3) "He has good friends, good companions, good comrades.

(4) "He is one of right view, [291] possessing a right perspective.

(5) "He gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are dwellings in happiness in this very life.

(6) "He recollects his manifold past abodes, that is, one birth, two births ... [as in 8:11] . . . thus he recollects his manifold past abodes with their aspects and details.

(7) "With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human... [as in 8:11]... he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma.:

(8) "With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.

"Possessing these eight qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

58 (8) Worthy of Offerings (2)

"Bhikkhus, possessing eight qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What eight?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous. . . Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them.

(2) "He has learned much . . . and penetrated well by view.

(3) "He has aroused energy; ${ }^{1756}$ he is strong, firm in exertion, and has not cast off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities.

(4) "He is a forest dweller, one who resorts to remote lodgings.

(5) "He has vanquished discontent and delight; he overcame discontent whenever it arose.

(6) "He has vanquished fear and terror; he overcame fear and terror whenever they arose. [292]

(7) "He gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are dwellings in happiness in this very life.

(8) "With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.

"Possessing these eight qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

59 (9) Eight Persons (1)

"Bhikkhus; these eight persons are worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What eight? The stream-enterer, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of stream-entry; the once-returner, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of once-returning; the non-returner, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of non-returning; the arahant, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of arahantship. ${ }^{1757}$ These eight persons, bhikkhus, are worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

The four practicing the way ${ }^{1758}$

and the four established in the fruit:

this is the upright Sangha-

composed in wisdom and virtuous behavior. ${ }^{1759}$

For people intent on sacrifice, for living beings seeking merit, making merit that ripens in the acquisitions, ${ }^{1760}$ what is given to the Sangha bears great fruit.

60 (10) Eight Persons (2)

"Bhikkhus, these eight persons are worthy of gifts ... an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What eight? [293] The stream-enterer, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of stream-entry ... the arahant, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of arahantship. These eight persons, bhikkhus, are worthy of gifts ... an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

The four practicing the way and the four established in the fruit: the eight persons among beings-

this is the foremost Sangha.

For people intent on sacrifice, for living beings seeking merit, making merit that ripens in the acquisitions, what is given here bears great fruit.

61 (1) Desire

"Bhikkhus, there are these eight kinds of persons found existing in the world. What eight?

(1) "Here, when a bhikkhu is dwelling in solitude, living independently, a desire arises in him for gain. He rouses himself, strives, and makes an effort to acquire gain. ${ }^{1761}$ Nevertheless, he fails to acquire gain.

# 63 (3) In Brief

Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that, having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute."

"It is in just this way that some hollow men here make requests of me, but when the Dhamma has been explained, they think only of following me around. ${ }^{1764}$

"Bhante, let the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma in brief. Let the Fortunate One teach me the Dhamma in brief. Perhaps I might come to understand the meaning of the Blessed One's statement; perhaps I might become an heir of the Blessed One's statement."

"In that case, bhikkhu, you should train yourself thus: 'My mind will be firm and well settled internally. Arisen bad unwholesome states will not obsess my mind.' Thus should you train yourself.

(1) "When, bhikkhu, your mind is firm and well settled internally, and arisen bad unwholesome states do not obsess your mind, then you should train yourself thus: [300] 'I will develop and cultivate the liberation of the mind by loving-kindness, make it a vehicle and basis, carry it out, consolidate it, and properly undertake it.' Thus should you train yourself.

"When this concentration has been developed and cultivated by you in this way, then you should develop this concentration with thought and examination; you should develop it without thought but with examination only; you should develop it without thought and examination. You should develop it with rapture; you should develop it without rapture; you should develop it accompanied by comfort; and you should develop it accompanied by equanimity. ${ }^{1765}$

(2)-(4) "When, bhikkhu, this concentration has been developed and well developed by you in this way, then you should train yourself thus: 'I will develop and cultivate the liberation of
the mind by compassion ... the liberation of the mind by altruistic joy ... the liberation of the mind by equanimity, make it a vehicle and basis, carry it out, consolidate it, and properly undertake it.' Thus should you train yourself.

"When this concentration has been developed and cultivated ${ }^{1 / 66}$ by you in this way, then you should develop this concentration with thought and examination; you should develop it without thought but with examination only; you should develop it without thought and examination. You should develop it with rapture; you should develop it without rapture; you should develop it accompanied by comfort; and you should develop it accompanied by equanimity.

(5) "When, bhikkhu, this concentration has been developed and well developed by you in this way, then you should train yourself thus: 'I will dwell contemplating the body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed longing and dejection in regard to the world.' Thus should you train yourself.

"When this concentration has been developed and cultivated by you in this way, then you should develop this concentration with thought and examination; you should develop it without thought but with examination [301] only; you should develop it without thought and examination. You should develop it with rapture; you should develop it without rapture; you should develop it accompanied by comfort; and you should develop it accompanied by equanimity.

(6)-(8) "When, bhikkhu, this concentration has been developed and well developed by you in this way, then you should train yourself thus: 'I will dwell contemplating feelings in feelings... mind in mind... phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed longing and dejection in regard to the world.' Thus should you train yourself.

"When this concentration has been developed and cultivated by you in this way, then you should develop this concentration with thought and examination; you should develop it without thought but with examination only; you should develop it without thought and examination. You should develop it with rapture; you should develop it without rapture; you should develop it accompanied by comfort; and you should develop it accompanied by equanimity.
"When, bhikkhu, this concentration has been developed and well developed by you in this way, then wherever you walk, you will walk at ease; wherever you stand, you will stand at ease; wherever you sit, you will sit at ease; wherever you lie down, you will lie down at ease."

Having received such an exhortation from the Blessed One, that bhikkhu rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed. ${ }^{1767}$ Then, dwelling alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute, in no long time that bhikkhu realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having entered upon it, he dwelled in it. [302] He directly knew: "Destroyed is birth; the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being." And that bhikkhu became one of the arahants.

# 64 (4) Gayä

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Gayä on Gayāsisa. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

(1) "Bhikkhus, before my enlightenment, while I was still a bodhisatta, not yet fully enlightened, I perceived only a light, but I did not see forms. ${ }^{1768}$

(2) "It occurred to me, bhikkhus: 'If I should perceive a light and also see forms, in such a case this knowledge and vision of mine would become even more purified. ${ }^{1769}$ So on a later occasion, as I was dwelling heedful, ardent, and resolute, I perceived a light and also saw forms. Yet I did not associate with those deities, converse with them, and engage in a discussion with them.

(3) "It occurred to me, bhikkhus: 'If I perceive a light and see forms, and also associate with those deities, converse with them, and engage in a discussion with them, in such a case this knowledge and vision of mine would become even more purified.' So on a later occasion, as I was dwelling heedful, ardent, and resolute, I perceived a light and saw forms, and I also associated with those deities, conversed with them, and engaged in
a discussion with them. Yet I did not know about those deities: 'These deities are from this or that order of devas.' [303]

(4) "It occurred to me, bhikkhus: 'If I perceive a light and see forms, and associate with those deities, converse with them, and engage in a discussion with them, and also know about those deities: 'These deities are from this or that order of devas,' in such a case this knowledge and vision of mine would become even more purified.' So on a later occasion, as I was dwelling heedful, ardent, and resolute, I perceived a light and saw forms, and associated with those deities, conversed with them, and engaged in a discussion with them, and I also knew about those deities: 'These deities are from this or that order of devas.' Yet I did not know of those deities: 'After passing away here these deities were reborn there as a result of this kamma.'

(5) "... and I also knew about those deities: 'After passing away here these deities were reborn there as a result of this kamma.' Yet I did not know of those deities: 'As a result of this kamma, these deities subsist on such food and experience such pleasure and pain.'

(6) "... and I also knew about those deities: 'As a result of this kamma, these deities subsist on such food and experience such pleasure and pain.' Yet I did not know of those deities: 'As a result of this kamma, these deities have a life span of such length.'

(7) "... and I also knew about those deities: 'As a result of this kamma, these deities have a life span of such length.' Yet I did not know whether or not I had previously lived together with those deities.

(8) "It occurred to me, bhikkhus: 'If (i) I perceive a light and (ii) see forms; and (iii) I associate with those deities, converse with them, and engage in a discussion with them [304]; and (iv) know about those deities: 'These deities are from this or that order of devas'; and (v) 'After passing away here, these deities were reborn there as a result of this kamma'; and (vi) 'As a result of this kamma, these deities subsist on such food and experience such pleasure and pain'; and (vii) 'As a result of this kamma, these deities have a life span of such length'; and (viii) also know whether or not I had previously lived together with those deities, in such a case this knowledge and vision of mine would become even more purified.'
"So on a later occasion, as I was dwelling heedful, ardent, and resolute: (i) I perceived a light and (ii) saw forms; and (iii) I associated with those deities, conversed with them, and engaged in a discussion with them; and (iv) I also knew about those deities: 'These deities are from this or that order of devas'; and (v) 'After passing away here, these deities were reborn there as a result of this kamma'; and (vi) 'As a result of this kamma, these deities subsist on such food and experience such pleasure and pain'; and (vii) 'As a result of this kamma, these deities have a life span of such length'; and (viii) I also knew whether or not I had previously lived together with those deities. ${ }^{1770}$

"So long, bhikkhus, as my knowledge and vision about the devas with its eight facets was not well purified, I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in. this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans. But when my knowledge and vision about the devas with its eight facets was well purified, then I [305] claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with... its devas and humans. The knowledge and vision arose in me: 'Unshakable is my liberation of mind; this is my last birth; now there is no more renewed existence.'"

# 65 (5) Overcoming

"Bhikkhus, there are these eight bases of overcoming. ${ }^{1771}$ What eight?

(1) "One percipient of forms internally sees forms externally, limited, beautiful or ugly. Having overcome them, he is percipient thus: 'I know, I see.' This is the first basis of overcoming. ${ }^{1772}$

(2) "One percipient of forms internally sees forms externally, measureless, beautiful or ugly. Having overcome them, he is percipient thus: 'I know, I see.' This is the second basis of overcoming. ${ }^{1773}$

(3) "One not percipient of forms internally sees forms externally, limited, beautiful or ugly. Having overcome them, he is percipient thus: 'I know, I see.' This is the third basis of overcoming. ${ }^{1774}$

(4) "One not percipient of forms internally sees forms externally, measureless, beautiful or ugly. Having overcome them,
he is percipient thus: 'I know, I see.' This is the fourth basis of overcoming.

(5) "One not percipient of forms internally sees forms externally, blue ones, blue in color, with a blue hue, with a blue tint. Having overcome them, he is percipient thus: 'I know, I see.' This is the fifth basis of overcoming. ${ }^{1775}$

(6) "One not percipient of forms internally sees forms externally, yellow ones, yellow in color, with a yellow hue, with a yellow tint. Having overcome them, he is percipient thus: 'I know, I see.' This is the sixth basis of overcoming. [306]

(7) "One not percipient of forms internally sees forms externally, red ones, red in color, with a red hue, with a red tint. Having overcome them, he is percipient thus: 'I know, I see.' This is the seventh basis of overcoming.

(8) "One not percipient of forms internally sees forms externally, white ones, white in color, with a white hue, with a white tint. Having overcome them, he is percipient thus: 'I know, I see.' This is the eighth basis of overcoming.

"These, bhikkhus, are the eight bases of overcoming."

66 (6) Emancipations

"Bhikkhus, there are these eight emancipations. ${ }^{1776}$ What eight?

(1) "One possessing form sees forms. This is the first emancipation. ${ }^{1777}$

(2) "One not percipient of forms internally sees forms externally. This is the second emancipation. ${ }^{1778}$

(3) "One is focused only on 'beautiful.' This is the third emancipation. ${ }^{1779}$

(4) "With the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, [perceiving] 'space is infinite,' one enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of space. This is the fourth emancipation.

(5) "By completely surmounting the base of the infinity of space, [perceiving] 'consciousness is infinite,' one enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of consciousness. This is the fifth emancipation.

(6) "By completely surmounting the base of the infinity of consciousness, [perceiving] 'there is nothing,' one enters and dwells in the base of nothingness. This is the sixth emancipation.
(7) "By completely surmounting the base of nothingness, one enters and dwells in the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception. This is the seventh emancipation.

(8) "By completely surmounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, one enters and dwells in the cessation of perception and feeling. ${ }^{1780}$ This is the eighth emancipation.

"These, bhikkhus, are the eight emancipations." [307]

# 67 (7) Declarations (1)

"Bhikkhus, there are these eight ignoble declarations. ${ }^{1781}$ What eight? (1) Saying that one has seen what one has not seen; (2) saying that one has heard what one has not heard; (3) saying that one has sensed what one has not sensed; (4) saying that one has cognized what one has not cognized; (5) saying that one has not seen what one has actually seen; (6) saying that one has not heard what one has actually heard; (7) saying that one has not sensed what one has actually sensed; (8) saying that one has not cognized what one has actually cognized.

These are the eight noble declarations."

## 69 (9) Assemblies ${ }^{1783}$

"Bhikkhus, there are these eight assemblies. What eight? An assembly of khattiyas, an assembly of brahmins, an assembly of householders, an assembly of ascetics, an assembly of the devas [ruled by] the four great kings, an assembly of the Tāvatimsa devas, an assembly of Māra, an assembly of Brahmā.

(1) "Now I recall, bhikkhus, approaching an assembly consisting of many hundreds of khattiyas. I previously sat there, conversed, and held discussions. I appeared just like them,
and my voice became like their voice. I instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened them with a Dhamma talk, and while I was speaking they did not recognize me but thought: 'Who is it that is speaking, a deva or a human being?' Having instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened them with a Dhamma talk, I disappeared, and when I had disappeared they did not recognize me but thought: 'Who was it that has disappeared, a deva or a human being? ${ }^{1784}$ [308]

(2)-(8) "Then I recall, bhikkhus, approaching an assembly consisting of many hundreds of brahmins... an assembly consisting of many hundreds of householders... an assembly consisting of many hundreds of ascetics... an assembly consisting of many hundreds of the devas [ruled by] the four great kings . . . an assembly consisting of many hundreds of the Tāvatimsa devas . . . an assembly consisting of many hundreds under Māra . . . an assembly consisting of many hundreds under Brahmā. I previously sat there, conversed, and held discussions. I appeared just like them, and my voice became like their voice. I instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened them with a Dhamma talk, and while I was speaking they did not recognize me but thought: 'Who is it that is speaking, a deva or a human being?' Having instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened them with a Dhamma talk, I disappeared, and when I had disappeared they did not recognize me but thought: 'Who was it that has disappeared, a deva or a human being?'

"These, bhikkhus, are the eight assemblies."

# 70 (10) Earthquakes ${ }^{1785}$

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Vesālī for alms. When he had walked for alms in Vesālī, after his meal, on returning from his alms round, he addressed the Venerable Ānanda: "Take a sitting cloth, Ānanda. Let us go to the Cāpāla Shrine for the day's dwelling."

"Yes, Bhante," the Venerable Ānanda replied and, having taken a sitting cloth, he followed closely behind the Blessed One. The Blessed One then went to the Cāpāla Shrine, sat down on the seat that was prepared for him, and said to the Venerable Ānanda: [309]
"Delightful is Vesālī, Ānanda, Delightful is the Udena Shrine, delightful the Gotamaka Shrine, delightful the Sattamba Shrine, delightful the Bahuputta Shrine, delightful the Sārandada Shrine, delightful the Cāpāla Shrine. Whoever, Ānanda, has developed and cultivated the four bases for psychic potency, made them a vehicle and basis, carried them out, consolidated them, and properly undertaken them could, if he so wished, live on for an eon or for the remainder of an eon. The Tathāgata, Ānanda, has developed and cultivated the four bases for psychic potency, made them a vehicle and basis, carried them out, consolidated them, and properly undertaken them. If he so wished, the Tathāgata could live on for an eon or for the remainder of an eon. ${ }^{11786}$

But though the Venerable Ānanda was given such an obvious signal by the Blessed One, though he was given such an obvious hint, he was unable to pick up the hint. He did not request the Blessed One: "Bhante, let the Blessed One live on for an eon! Let the Fortunate One live on for an eon, for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans." For his mind was obsessed by Māra. ${ }^{1787}$

A second time... A third time the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ānanda: "Delightful is Vesālī... Delightful is the Udena Shrine... delightful the Cāpāla Shrine. Whoever, Ānanda, has developed and cultivated the four bases for psychic potency ... and properly undertaken them could, if he so wished, live on for an eon or for the remainder of an eon. The Tathāgata, Ānanda, has developed and cultivated the four bases for psychic potency, made them a vehicle and basis, carried them out, consolidated them, and properly undertaken them. If he so wished, the Tathāgata could live on for an eon or for the remainder of an eon."

But again, though the Venerable Ānanda [310] was given such an obvious signal by the Blessed One, though he was given such an obvious hint, he was unable to pick up the hint.... For his mind was obsessed by Māra.

Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ānanda: "You may go, Ānanda, at your own convenience."

"Yes, Bhante," the Venerable Ānanda replied, and he rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated
him keeping the right side toward him, and sat down at the foot of a tree not far from the Blessed One.

Then, not long after the Venerable Ānanda had left, Māra the Evil One said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, let the Blessed One now attain final nibbāna! Let the Fortunate One now attain final nibbāna! Now is the time, Bhante, for the Blessed One's final nibbāna! These words were uttered, Bhante, by the Blessed One: ${ }^{1788}$ 'I will not attain final nibbāna, Evil One, until there are bhikkhu disciples of mine who are competent, disciplined, selfconfident, attained to security from bondage, learned, upholders of the Dhamma, practicing in accordance with the Dhamma, practicing in the proper way, conducting themselves accordingly; who have learned their own teacher's teaching and can explain it, teach it, proclaim it, establish it, disclose it, analyze it, and elucidate it; who can thoroughly refute in reasoned ways the current tenets of others and teach the antidotal Dhamma. ${ }^{1789}$ Now at present the Blessed One has bhikkhú disciples who are competent... and who can teach the antidotal Dhamma. Bhante, let the Blessed One now attain final nibbāna! Let the Fortunate One now attain final nibbāna! Now is the time for the Blessed One's final nibbāna!

"And these words were uttered, Bhante, by the Blessed One: 'I will not attain final nibbāna, Evil One, until there are bhikkhunī disciples of mine who are competent... until there are male lay disciples of mine [311] who are competent . . . until there are female lay disciples of mine who are competent . . . and teach the antidotal Dhamma.' Now at present the Blessed One has bhikkhunī disciples . . . male lay disciples . . female lay disciples who are competent, disciplined, self-confident, attained to security from bondage, learned, upholders of the Dhamma, practicing in accordance with the Dhamma, practicing in the proper way, conducting themselves accordingly; who have learned their own teacher's doctrine and can explain it, teach it, proclaim it, establish it, disclose it, analyze it, and elucidate it; who can thoroughly refute in reasoned ways the current tenets of others and teach the antidotal Dhamma. Bhante, let the Blessed One now attain final nibbāna! Let the Fortunate One now attain final nibbāna! Now is the time for the Blessed One's final nibbāna!

"And these words were uttered, Bhante, by the Blessed One:
'I will not attain final nibbāna, Evil One, until this spiritual life of mine has become successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, well proclaimed among devas and humans.' That spiritual life of the Blessed One has become successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, well proclaimed among devas and humans. Bhante, let the Blessed One now attain final nibbāna! Let the Fortunate One now attain final nibbāna! Now is the time, Bhante, for the Blessed One's final nibbāna!"

[The Blessed One said:] "Be at ease, Evil One. It won't be long before the Tathāgata's final nibbāna takes place. Three months from now the Tathāgata will attain final nibbāna."

Then the Blessed One, at the Cāpāla Shrine, mindful and clearly comprehending, let go his vital force. ${ }^{1790}$ And when the Blessed One had let go his vital force, a great earthquake occurred, frightening and terrifying, and peals of thunder shook the sky.

Then, having understood the meaning of this, the Blessed One on that occasion uttered this inspired utterance: [312]

"Comparing the incomparable and continued existence, the sage let go the force of existence:

Rejoicing internally, concentrated, he broke his own existence like a coat of armor. ${ }^{\text {"1791 }}$

Then it occurred to the Venerable Ānanda: "This earthquake was indeed powerful! This earthquake was indeed very powerful, frightening and terrifying, and peals of thunder shook the sky! What is the cause and condition for a powerful earthquake?"

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: "Bhante, this earthquake was indeed powerful! This earthquake was indeed very powerful, frightening and terrifying, and peals of thunder shook the sky! What, Bhante, is the cause and condition for a powerful earthquake?"

"Ānanda, there are these eight causes and conditions for a powerful earthquake. What eight?

(1) "Ānanda, this great earth is established upon water; the water rests upon wind; the wind blows in space. There comes
a time, Ānanda, when strong winds blow and shake the water. The water, being shaken, shakes the earth. This is the first cause and condition for a powerful earthquake.

(2) "Again, there is an ascetic or brahmin who possesses psychic potency and has attained mastery of mind, or a deity who is very powerful and mighty. He has developed a limited perception of earth and a measureless perception of water. He makes this earth shake, shudder, and tremble. ${ }^{1792}$ This is the second cause and condition for a powerful earthquake.

(3) "Again, when the bodhisatta passes away from the Tusita order and, mindful and clearly comprehending, enters his mother's womb, this [313] earth shakes, shudders, and trembles. This is the third cause and condition for a powerful earthquake.

(4) "Again, when the bodhisatta, mindful and clearly comprehending, emerges from his mother's womb, this earth shakes, shudders, and trembles. This is the fourth cause and condition for a powerful earthquake.

(5) "Again, when the Tathāgata awakens to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment, this earth shakes, shudders, and trembles. This is the fifth cause and condition for a powerful earthquake.

(6) "Again, when the Tathāgata sets in motion the unsurpassed wheel of the Dhamma, this earth shakes, shudders, and trembles. This is the sixth cause and condition for a powerful earthquake.

(7) "Again, when the Tathāgata, mindful and clearly comprehending, lets go his vital force, this earth shakes, shudders, and trembles. This is the seventh cause and condition for a powerful earthquake.

(8) "Again, when the Tathāgata attains final nibbāna by the nibbāna element without residue remaining, this earth shakes, shudders, and trembles. This is the eighth cause and condition for a powerful earthquake.

"These are the eight causes and conditions for a powerful earthquake." [314]

# 73 (3) Mindfulness of Death (1) ${ }^{1793}$

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Nädika in the brick hall. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: [317] "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, mindfulness of death, when developed and cultivated, is of great fruit and benefit, culminating in the deathless, having the deathless as its consummation. But do you, bhikkhus, develop mindfulness of death?"

(1) When this was said, one bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, I develop mindfulness of death."

"But how, bhikkhu, do you develop mindfulness of death?"

"Here, Bhante, I think thus: 'May I live just a night and a day so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching. I could then accomplish much!' It is in this way that I develop mindfulness of death."

(2) Another bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "I too, Bhante, develop mindfulness of death."

"But how, bhikkhu, do you develop mindfulness of death?"

"Here, Bhante, I think: 'May I live just a day so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching. I could then accomplish much!' It is in this way that I develop mindfulness of death."

(3) Still another bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "I too, Bhante, develop mindfulness of death."

"But how, bhikkhu, do you develop mindfulness of death?"

"Here, Bhante, I think: 'May I live just half a day so that I may
attend to the Blessed One's teaching. I could then accomplish much!' It is in this way that I develop mindfulness of death."

(4) Still another bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "I too, Bhante, develop mindfulness of death."

"But how, bhikkhu, do you develop mindfulness of death?"

"Here, Bhante, I think: 'May I live just the time it takes to eat a single alms meal so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching. I could then accomplish much!' It is in this way that I develop mindfulness of death:"

(5) Still another bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "I too, Bhante, develop mindfulness of death."

"But how, bhikkhu, do you develop mindfulness of death?"

"Here, [318] Bhante, I think: 'May I live just the time it takes to eat half an alms meal so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching. I could then accomplish much!' It is in this way that I develop mindfulness of death."

(6) Still another bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "I too, Bhante, develop mindfulness of death."

"But how, bhikkhu, do you develop mindfulness of death?"

"Here, Bhante, I think: 'May I live just the time it takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls of food so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching. I could then accomplish much!' It is in this way that I develop mindfulness of death."

(7) Still another bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "I too, Bhante, develop mindfulness of death."

"But how, bhikkhu, do you develop mindfulness of death?"

"Here, Bhante, I think: 'May I live just the time it takes to chew and swallow a single mouthful of food so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching. I could then accomplish much!' It is in this way that I develop mindfulness of death."

(8) Still another bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "I too, Bhante, develop mindfulness of death."

"But how, bhikkhu, do you develop mindfulness of death?"

"Here, Bhante, I think: 'May I live just the time it takes to breathe out after breathing in, or to breathe in after breathing
out, so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching. I could then accomplish much!' It is in this way that I develop mindfulness of death."

When this was said, the Blessed One said to those bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, (1) the bhikkhu who develops mindfulness of death thus: 'May I live just a night and a day so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching. I could then accomplish much!'; and (2) the one who develops mindfulness of death thus: [319] 'May I live just a day so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching. I could then accomplish much!'; and (3) the one who develops mindfulness of death thus: 'May I live just half a day so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching.

I could then accomplish much!'; and (5) the one who develops mindfulness of death thus: 'May I live just the length of time it takes to eat half an alms meal so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching. I could then accomplish much!'; and (6) the one who develops mindfulness of death thus: 'May I live just the length of time it takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls of food so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching. I could then accomplish much!': these are called bhikkhus who dwell heedlessly. They develop mindfulness of death sluggishly for the destruction of the taints.

"But (7) the bhikkhu who develops mindfulness of death thus: 'May I live just the length of time it takes to chew and swallow a single mouthful of food so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching. I could then accomplish much!'; and (8) the one who develops mindfulness of death thus: 'May I live just the length of time it takes to breathe out after breathing in, or to breathe in after breathing out, so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching. I could then accomplish much!': these are called bhikkhus who dwell heedfully. They develop mindfulness of death keenly for the destruction of the taints.

"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will dwell heedfully. We will develop mindfulness of death keenly for the destruction of the taints.' Thus should you train yourselves." [320]

74 (4) Mindfulness of Death (2) ${ }^{1794}$

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Nädika in the brick hall. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, mindfulness of death, when developed and cultivated, is of great fruit and benefit, culminating in the deathless, having the deathless as its consummation. And how is this so?

"Here, bhikkhus, when day has receded and night has approached, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'I could die on account of many causes. (1) A snake might bite me, or a scorpion or centipede might sting me, and I might thereby die; that would be an obstacle for me. (2) I might stumble and fall down, or (3) my food might disagree with me, or (4) my bile might become agitated, or (5) my phlegm might become agitated, or (6) sharp winds in me might become agitated, or (7) people might attack me, or (8) wild spirits might attack me, and I might die; that would be an obstacle for me.'

"This bhikkhu should reflect thus: 'Do I have any bad unwholesome qualities that have not been abandoned, which might become an obstacle for me if I were to die tonight?' If, upon review, the bhikkhu knows: 'I have bad unwholesome qualities that have not been abandoned, which might become an obstacle for me if I were to die tonight,' then he should put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to abandon those bad unwholesome qualities. Just as one whose clothes or head had caught fire would put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to extinguish [the fire on] his clothes or head, so that bhikkhu [321] should put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to abandon those bad unwholesome qualities.

"But if, upon review, the bhikkhu knows: 'I do not have any bad unwholesome qualities that have not been abandoned, which might become an obstacle for me if I were to die tonight,' then he should dwell in that same rapture and joy, training day and night in wholesome qualities.
"But when night has receded and day has approached, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'I could die on account of many causes. A snake might bite me . . . or wild spirits might attack me, and I might die; that would be an obstacle for me.'

"This bhikkhu should reflect thus: 'Do I have any bad unwholesome qualities that have not been abandoned which might become an obstacle for me if I were to die this day?' If, upon review, the bhikkhu knows: 'I have bad unwholesome qualities that I have not yet abandoned, which might become an obstacle for me if I were to die this day,' then he should put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness; and clear comprehension to abandon those bad unwholesome qualities. Just as one whose clothes or head had caught fire would put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to extinguish [the fire on] his clothes or head, so that bhikkhu should put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to abandon those bad unwholesome qualities.

"It is, bhikkhus, when mindfulness of death is developed and cultivated in this way that it is of great fruit and benefit, culminating in the deathless, having the deathless as its consummation."

# 75 (5) Accomplishments (1)

"Bhikkhus, there are these eight accomplishments. What eight? Accomplishment in initiative, accomplishment in protection, good friendship, balanced living, accomplishment in faith, accomplishment in virtuous behavior, accomplishment in generosity, and accomplishment in wisdom. These are the eight accomplishments."

[Four verses are attached, identical with those of 8:54.]

76 (6) Accomplishments (2)

"Bhikkhus, there are these eight accomplishments. What eight? ${ }^{1795}$ Accomplishment in initiative, accomplishment in
protection, good friendship, balanced living, accomplishment in faith, accomplishment in virtuous behavior, accomplishment in generosity, and accomplishment in wisdom.

(1) "And what is accomplishment in initiative? Here, whatever may be the means by which a clansman earns his livingwhether by farming, trade, raising cattle, archery, government service, or by some other craft [323]-he is skillful and diligent; he possesses sound judgment about it in order to carry out and arrange it properly. This is called accomplishment in initiative.

(2) "And what is accomplishment in protection? Here, a clansman sets up protection and guard over the wealth he has acquired by initiative and energy, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained, thinking: 'How can I prevent kings and thieves from taking it, fire from burning it, floods from sweeping it off; and displeasing heirs from taking it?' This is called accomplishment in protection.

(3) "And what is good friendship? Here, in whatever village or town a clansman lives, he associates with householders or their sons-whether young but of mature virtue, or old and of mature virtue-who are accomplished in faith, virtuous behavior, generosity, and wisdom; he converses with them and engages in discussions with them. Insofar as they are accomplished in faith, he emulates them with respect to their accomplishment in faith; insofar as they are accomplished in virtuous behavior, he emulates them with respect to their accomplishment in virtuous behavior; insofar as they are accomplished in generosity, he emulates them with respect to their accomplishment in generousity; insofar as they are accomplished in wisdom, he emulates them with respect to their accomplishment in wisdom. This is called good friendship.

(4) "And what is balanced living? Here, a clansman knows his income and expenditures and leads a balanced life, neither too extravagant nor too frugal, [aware]: 'In this way my income will exceed my expenditures rather than the reverse.' Just as an appraiser or his apprentice, holding up a scale, knows: 'By so much it has dipped down, [324] by so much it has gone up,' so a clansman knows his income and expenditures and leads a balanced life, neither too extravagant nor too frugal, [aware]:
'In this way my income will exceed my expenditures rather than the reverse.'

"If this clansman has a small income but lives luxuriously, others would say of him: 'This clansman eats his wealth just like an eater of figs.' But if he has a large income but lives sparingly, others would say of him: 'This clansman may even starve himself.' But it is called balanced living when a clansman knows his income and expenditures and leads a balanced life, neither too extravagant nor too frugal, [aware]: 'Thus my income will exceed my expenditures rather than the reverse.'

(5) "And what is accomplishment in faith? Here, a clansman is endowed with faith. He places faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant... teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' This is called accomplishment in faith.

(6) "And what is accomplishment in virtuous behavior? Here, a clansman abstains from the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. This is called accomplishment in virtuous behavior.

(7) "And what is accomplishment in generosity? Here, a clansman dwells at home with a heart devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in relinquishment, one devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing. This is called accomplishment in generosity.

(8) "And what is accomplishment in wisdom? [325] Here, a clansman is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. This is called accomplishment in wisdom.

"These, bhikkhus, are the eight accomplishments."

[The four verses are identical with those in 8:54.]

# 77 (7) Desire

There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend," those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:

"Friends, there are these eight kinds of persons found existing in the world. What eight?"...
[What follows is identical with 8:61, but spoken by Sāriputta.] . . [326-28]

"These are the eight kinds of persons found existing in the world."

# 78 (8) Able

There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"...

(1) "Friends, possessing six qualities, a bhikkhu is able [to benefit] both himself and others. What six?...

[What follows is identical with 8:62, but spoken by Sāriputta.] ... [329-31]

"Possessing these two qualities, a bhikkhu is able [to benefit] others but not himself."

79 (9) Decline ${ }^{1796}$

"Bhikkhus, these eight qualities lead to the decline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee. What eight? Delight in work, delight in talk, delight in sleep, delight in company, not guarding the doors of the sense faculties, lack of moderation in eating, delight in bonding, and delight in proliferation. These eight qualities lead to the decline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee.

"Bhikkhus, these eight qualities lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee. What eight? Not taking delight in work, not taking delight in talk, not taking delight in sleep, not taking delight in company, guarding the doors of the sense faculties, moderation in eating, not taking delight in bonding, and not taking delight in proliferation. These eight qualities lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee." [332]

80 (10) Grounds for Laziness and Arousing Energy

"Bhikkhus, there are these eight grounds for laziness. What eight?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu has to do some work. It occurs to him: 'I have some work to do. While I'm working, my body will become tired. Let me lie down.' He lies down. He does not arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. This is the first ground for laziness.

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu has done some work. It occurs to him: 'I've done some work. Because of the work, my body has
become tired. Let me lie down.' He lies down. He does not arouse energy... for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. This is the second ground for laziness.

(3) "Again, a bhikkhu has to make a trip. It occurs to him: 'I have to make a trip. While traveling, my body will become tired. Let me lie down.' He lies down. He does not arouse energy... for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. This is the third ground for laziness.

(4) "Again, a bhikkhu has made a trip. It occurs to him: 'I've made a trip. While traveling, my body has become tired. Let me lie down.' He lies down. He does not arouse energy ... for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. This is the fourth ground for laziness.

(5) "Again, a bhikkhu has walked for alms in a village or town but has not gotten as much food as he needs, whether coarse or excellent. It occurs to him: [333] 'I've walked for alms in the village or town but didn't get as much food as I need, whether coarse or excellent. My body has become tired and unwieldy. Let me lie down.' He lies down. He does not arouse energy . . . for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. This is the fifth ground for laziness.

(6) "Again, a bhikkhu has walked for alms in a village or town and has gotten as much food as he needs, whether coarse or excellent. It occurs to him: 'I've walked for alms in the village or town and gotten as much food as I need, whether coarse or excellent. My body has become as heavy and unwieldy as a heap of wet beans. Let me lie down.' He lies down. He does not arouse energy . . . for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. This is the sixth ground for laziness.

(7) "Again, a bhikkhu is a little ill. It occurs to him: 'I'm a little ill. I need to lie down. Let me lie down.' He lies down. He does not arouse energy . . . for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. This is the seventh ground for laziness.

(8) "Again, a bhikkhu has recovered from illness. Soon after recovering, it occurs to him: 'I've recovered from illness; I've just recovered from illness. My body is still weak and unwieldy. Let me lie down.' He lies down. He does not arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. This is the eighth ground for laziness.

"These are the eight grounds for laziness. [334]
"Bhikkhus, there are these eight grounds for arousing energy. What eight?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu has some work to do. It occurs to him: 'I have to do some work. While working, it won't be easy for me to attend to the teaching of the Buddhas. Let me in advance arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.' He arouses energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yetunachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. This is the first ground for arousing enérgy.

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu has done some work. It occurs to him: 'I've done some work. While working, it wasn't possible for me to attend to the teaching of the Buddhas. Let me arouse energy....' This is the second ground for arousing energy.

(3) "Again, a bhikkhu has to make a trip. It occurs to him: 'I have to make a trip. While traveling, it won't be easy for me to attend to the teaching of the Buddhas. Let me in advance arouse energy....' This is the third ground for arousing energy.

(4) "Again, a bhikkhu has made a trip. It occurs to him: 'I've made a trip. While traveling, it wasn't possible for me to attend to the teaching of the Buddhas. Let me arouse energy....' This is the fourth ground for arousing energy. [335]

(5) "Again, a bhikkhu has walked for alms in a village or town but has not gotten as much food as he needs, whether coarse or excellent. It occurs to him: 'I've walked for alms in a village or town but didn't get as much food as I need, whether coarse or excellent. My body is light and wieldy. Let me arouse energy....' This is the fifth ground for arousing energy.

(6) "Again, a bhikkhu has walked for alms in a village or town and has gotten as much food as he needs, whether coarse or excellent. It occurs to him: 'I've walked for alms in the village or town and gotten as much food as I need, whether coarse or excellent. My body is strong and wieldy. Let me arouse energy....' This is the sixth ground for arousing energy.

(7) "Again, a bhikkhu is a little ill. It occurs to him: 'I'm a little ill. It's possible that my illness will grow worse. Let me in advance arouse energy....' This is the seventh ground for arousing energy.

(8) "Again, a bhikkhu has recovered from illness. Soon after
recovering, it occurs to him: 'I've recovered from illness, just recovered from illness. It is possible that my illness will return. Let me in advance arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.' He arouses energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yetunrealized. This is the eighth ground for arousing energy.

"These are the eight grounds for arousing energy." [336]

# IV. Mindfulness

81 (1) Mindfulness ${ }^{1797}$

"Bhikkhus, (1) when there is no mindfulness and clear comprehension, for one deficient in mindfulness and clear comprehension, (2) the sense of moral shame and moral dread lack their proximate cause. When there is no sense of moral shame and moral dread, for one deficient in a sense of moral shame and moral dread, (3) restraint of the sense faculties lacks its proximate cause. When there is no restraint of the sense faculties, for one deficient in restraint of the sense faculties, (4) virtuous behavior lacks its proximate cause. When there is no virtuous behavior, for one deficient in virtuous behavior, (5) right concentration lacks its proximate cause. When there is no right concentration, for one deficient in right concentration, (6) the knowledge and vision of things as they really are lacks its proximate cause. When there is no knowledge and vision of things as they really are, for one deficient in the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, (7) disenchantment and dispassion lack their proximate cause. When there is no disenchantment and dispassion, for one deficient in disenchantment and dispassion, (8) the knowledge and vision of liberation lacks its proximate cause.

"Suppose there is a tree deficient in branches and foliage. Then its shoots do not grow to fullness; also its bark, softwood, and heartwood do not grow to fullness. So too, when there is no mindfulness and clear comprehension, for one deficient in mindfulness and clear comprehension, the sense of moral shame and moral dread lack their proximate cause. When there is no sense of moral shame and moral dread . . . the knowledge and vision of liberation lacks its proximate cause.
"Bhikkhus, (1) when there is mindfulness and clear comprehension, for one possessing mindfulness and clear comprehension, (2) the sense of moral shame and moral dread possess their proximate cause. When there is a sense of moral shame and moral dread, for one possessing a sense of moral shame and moral dread, (3) restraint of the sense faculties possesses its proximate cause. When there is restraint of the sense faculties, for one who exercises restraint over the sense faculties, (4) virtuous behavior possesses its proximate cause. When there is virtuous behavior, for one whose behavior is virtuous, (5) right concentration possesses its proximate cause. When there is right concentration, for one possessing right concentration, (6) the knowledge and vision of things as they really, are possesses its proximate cause. When there is the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, for one possessing the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, (7) disenchantment and dispassion possess their proximate cause. [337] When there is disenchantment and dispassion, for one possessing disenchantment and dispassion, (8) the knowledge and vision of liberation possesses its proximate cause.

When there is a sense of moral shame and moral dread ... the knowledge and vision of liberation possesses its proximate cause."

# §2 (2) Punniya

Then the Venerable Punniya approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, why is it that at times the Tathāgata is disposed to teach the Dhamma and at times is not disposed to teach?"1798

(1) "When, Punniya, a bhikkhu is endowed with faith but does not approach him, the Tathāgata is not disposed to teach the Dhamma. (2) But when a bhikkhu is endowed with faith and approaches him, the Tathāgata is disposed to teach.

(3) "When a bhikkhu is endowed with faith and approaches him, but he does not attend on him... (4) When he attends on him but does not ask questions... (5) When he asks questions
but does not listen to the Dhamma with eager ears... (6) When he listens to the Dhamma with eager ears, but having heard it, does not retain it in mind ... (7) When, having heard it, he retains it in mind but does not examine the meaning of the teachings that have been retained in mind... (8) When he examines the meaning of the teachings that have been retained in mind but does not understand the meaning and the Dhamma and then practice in accordance with the Dhamma, the Tathāgata is not disposed to teach the Dhamma.

"But, Punniya, (1) when a bhikkhu is endowed with faith, [338] (2) approaches [the Tathāgata], (3) attends [on the Tathāgata], (4) asks questions, and (5) listens to the Dhamma with eager ears; and (6) having heard the Dhamma, he retains it in mind, (7) examines the meaning of the teachings he has retained in mind, and (8) understands the meaning and the Dhamma and then practices in accordance with the Dhamma, the Tathāgata is disposed to teach the Dhamma. When, Punniya, one possesses these eight qualities, the Tathāgata is entirely disposed to teach the Dhamma."1799

# 83 (3) Rooted

"Bhikkhus, wanderers of other sects may ask you: (1) 'In what, friends, are all things rooted? (2) Through what do they come into being? (3) From what do they originate? ${ }^{1800}$ (4) Upon what do they converge? (5) By what are they headed? (6) What exercises authority over them? (7) What is their supervisor? (8) What is their core?' If you are asked thus, how would you answer them?"

"Bhante, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the Blessed One, take recourse in the Blessed One. It would be good if the Blessed One would clear up the meaning of this statement. Having heard it from him, the bhikkhus will retain it in mind."

"Then listen, bhikkhus, and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, if wanderers of other sects should ask you: 'What, friends, are all things rooted in? . . [339] . . What is their essence?' you should answer them as follows.

"Friends, (1) all things are rooted in desire. (2) They come
into being through attention. (3) They originate from contact. (4) They converge upon feeling. (5) They are headed by concentration. (6) Mindfulness exercises authority over them. (7) Wisdom is their supervisor. (8) Liberation is their core. ${ }^{1801}$

"If you are asked these questions, it is in such a way that you should answer those wanderers of other sects."

# 84 (4) A Thief

"Bhikkhus, possessing eight factors, a master thief quickly gets into trouble and does not last long. What eight? (1) He attacks one who does not attack him. (2) He stéals without leaving anything behind. (3) He kills a woman. (4) He rapes a young girl. (5) He robs a monk. (6) He robs the royal treasury. (7) He does his work in his neighborhood. And (8) he is not skilled in hiding [his plunder]. ${ }^{1892}$ Possessing these eight factors, a master thief quickly gets into trouble and does not last long.

"Bhikkhus, possessing eight factors, a master thief does not quickly get into trouble and lasts long. What eight? (1) He does not attack one who does not attack him. (2) He does not steal without leaving anything behind. (3) He does not kill a woman. (4) He does not rape a young girl. (5) He does not rob a monk. (6) He does not rob the royal treasury. (7) He does not do his work in his neighborhood. And (8) he is skilled in hiding [his plunder]. Possessing these eight factors, a master thief does not quickly get into trouble and lasts long." [340]

## 85 (5) Designations

"Bhikkhus, (1) 'Ascetic' is a designation for the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. (2) 'Brahmin' is a designation for the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. (3) 'Healer'... (4) 'Master of knowledge ${ }^{1803}$... (5) 'One unstained'...(6) 'Stainless one'...(7) 'Knower'...(8) 'Liberated one' is a designation for the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One."

That highest state to be attained by an ascetic, ${ }^{1804}$ by a brahmin who has lived the spiritual life, to be attained by a master of knowledge and a healerthat highest state to be attained by one unstained, by a stainless one who is purified,
to be attained by a knower, by one liberated[over that] I am triumphant in battle;

freed, I free others from bondage.

I am a nāga, supremely tamed, ${ }^{1805}$

one beyond training, attained to nibbāna.

86 (6) Nāgita ${ }^{1806}$

On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Sangha of bhikkhus when he reached the Kosalan brahmin village named Icchānañgala. There the Blessed One dwelled in the Icchānañgala woodland thicket. The brahmin householders of Icchānañgala heard: "It is said that the ascetic Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan family, has arrived at Icchānañgala and is now dwelling [341] in the Icchānañgala woodland thicket. Now a good report about that Master Gotama has circulated thus: 'That Blessed One is an arahant; perfectly enlightened ... [as in 6:42] . . . he reveals a spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure.' Now it is good to see such arahants."

Then, when the night had passed, the brahmin householders of Icchānañgala took abundant food of various kinds and went to the Icchānañgala woodland thicket. They stood outside the entrance making an uproar and a racket. Now on that occasion the Venerable Nāgita was the Blessed One's attendant. The Blessed One then addressed the Venerable Nāgita: "Who is making such an uproar and a racket, Nāgita? One would think it was fishermen at a haul of fish."

"Bhante, these are the brahmin householders of Icchānañgala who have brought abundant food of various kinds. They are standing outside the entrance, [wishing to offer it] to the Blessed One and the Sangha of bhikkhus."

"Let me never come upon fame, Nāgita, and may fame never catch up with me. One who does not gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, this bliss of renunciation, bliss of solitude, bliss of peace, bliss of enlightenment that I gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, might accept that vile pleasure, that slothful pleasure, the pleasure of gain, honor, and praise."

"Let the Blessed One now consent, Bhante, let the Fortunate One consent. This is now the time for the Blessed One to consent. Wherever the Blessed One will go now, the brahmin
householders of town and countryside will incline in the same direction. Just as, [342] when thick drops of rain are pouring down, the water flows down along the slope, so too, wherever the Blessed One will go now, the brahmin householders of town and country will incline in the same direction. For what reason? Because of the Blessed One's virtuous behavior and wisdom."

"Let me never come upon fame, Nāgita, and may fame never catch up with me. One who does not gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, this bliss of renunciation ... might accept that vile pleasure, that slothful pleasure, the pleasure of gain, honor, and praise.

"Even some deities, Nagita, may not gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, this bliss of renunciation, bliss of solitude, bliss of peace, bliss of enlightenment that I gain at will, without trouble or difficulty.

(1) "When, ${ }^{3807}$ Nägita, you come together and meet, intent on companionship, it occurs to me: 'Surely, these venerable ones do not gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, this bliss of renunciation, bliss of solitude, bliss of peace, bliss of enlightenment that I gain at will, without trouble or difficulty; for when they [343] come together and meet, they are intent upon companionship.

(2) "I see, Nägita, bhikkhus laughing and playing by poking one another with the fingers. It then occurs to me: 'Surely, these venerable ones do not gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, this bliss of renunciation . . . which I gain at will, without trouble or difficulty; for these venerable ones laugh and play by poking one another with the fingers.'

(3) "I see, Nägita, bhikkhus who, having eaten as much as they want until their bellies are full, yield to the pleasure of rest, the pleasure of sloth, the pleasure of sleep. It then occurs to me: 'Surely, these venerable ones do not gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, this bliss of renunciation . . . which I gain at will, without trouble or difficulty. For having eaten as much as they want until their bellics are full, they yield to the pleasure of rest, the pleasure of sloth, the pleasure of sleep.'

(4) "I see, Nägita, a bhikkhu dwelling on the outskirts of a village sitting in a state of concentration. It then occurs to me: 'Now amonastery attendant or a novice will return to this venerable one and cause him to fail away from that concentration. ${ }^{1808}$ [344]

For this reason I am not pleased with this bhikkhu's dwelling on the outskirts of a village.

(5) "I see, Nāgita, a forest-dwelling bhikkhu sitting dozing in the forest. It then occurs to me: 'Now this venerable one will dispel this sleepiness and fatigue and attend only to the perception of forest, [a state of] oneness.' For this reason I am pleased with this bhikkhu's dwelling in the forest.

(6) "I see, Nāgita, a forest-dwelling bhikkhu sitting in the forest in an unconcentrated state: It then occurs to me: 'Now this venerable one will concentrate his unconcentrated mind or guard his concentrated mind.' For this reason I am pleased with this bhikkhu's dwelling in the forest.

(7) "I see, Nāgita, a forest-dwelling bhikkhu sitting in the forest in a state of concentration. It then occurs to me: 'Now this venerable one will liberate his unliberated mind or guard his liberated mind.' For this reason I am pleased with this bhikkhu's dwelling in the forest.

(8) "When, Nāgita, I am traveling on a highway and do not see anyone ahead of me or behind me, even if it is just for the purpose of defecating and urinating, on that occasion I am at ease."

# 87 (7) Almsbowi

"Bhikkhus, when a lay follower possesses eight qualities, the Sangha, if it so wishes, may overturn the almsbowl on him. ${ }^{1609}$ What eight? [345] (1) He tries to prevent bhikkhus from acquiring gains; (2) he tries to bring harm to bhikkhus; (3) he tries to prevent bhikkhus from residing [in a certain place]; (4) he insults and reviles bhikkhus; (5) he divides bhikkhus from each other; (6) he speaks dispraise of the Buddha; (7) he speaks dispraise of the Dhamma; (8) he speaks dispraise of the Sangha.

# 90 (10) Behavior

"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu charged with aggravated misconduct ${ }^{1813}$ should behave rightly with respect to eight principles. (1) He should not give full ordination; (2) he should not give dependence; ${ }^{1814}$ (3) he should not have a novice attend upon him; (4) he should not accept an agreement to serve as an exhorter of bhikkhunīs; (5) even if he is agreed upon, he should not exhort bhikkhunīs; (6) he should not accept any agreement [to serve as an officer] in the Sangha; (7) he should not be placed in any chief position; (8) he should not give rehabilitation [in a case] with that root. ${ }^{1815}$ A bhikkhu charged with aggravated misconduct should behave rightly with respect to these eight principles."

## 1 (1) Enlightenment ${ }^{1821}$

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇ̣ika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, wanderers of other sects may ask you: 'What, friends, is the proximate cause for the development of the aids to enlightenment?' If you are asked thus, how would you answer them?"

"Bhante, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the Blessed One, take recourse in the Blessed One. It would be good if the Blessed One would clear up the meaning of this statement. Having heard it from him, the bhikkhus will retain it in mind."

"Then listen, bhikkhus, and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, if wanderers of other sects should ask you: 'What, friends, is the proximate cause for the development of the aids to enlightenment?' you should answer them as follows.
(1) "'Here, friends, a bhikkhu has good friends, good companions, [352] good comrades. This is the first proximate cause for the development of the aids to enlightenment.

(2) "'Again, friends, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. This is the second proximate cause....

(3) "'Again, friends, a bhikkhu gets to hear at will, without trouble or difficulty, talk concerned with the austere life that is conducive to opening up the heart, that is, talk on fewness of desires, on contentment, on solitude, on not getting bound up [with others], on arousing energy, on virtuous behavior, on concentration, on wisdom, on liberation, on the knowledge and vision of liberation. This is the third proximate cause....

(4) "'Again, friends, a bhikkhu has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities. This is the fourth proximate cause....

(5) "'Again, friends, a bhikkhu is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. This is the fifth proximate cause for the development of the aids to enlightenment.'

"When, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu has good friends, good companions, good comrades, it can be expected of him that he will be virtuous, one who dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha ... will train in them.

"When a bhikkhu has good friends, good companions, good comrades, it can be expected of him that he will get to hear at will, without trouble or difficulty, talk concerned with the austere life that is conducive to opening up the heart, that is, talk on fewness of desires... on the knowledge and vision of liberation.

"When a bhikkhu has good friends, good companions, good comrades, it can be expected of him that he will arouse energy [353] for abandoning unwholesome qualities . . . not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities.

"When a bhikkhu has good friends, good companions, good
comrades, it can be expected of him that he will be wise, possessing the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering.

"Having based himself on these five things, the bhikkhu should develop further [another] four things. (6) [The perception of] unattractiveness should be developed to abandon lust. (7) Loving-kindness should be developed to abandon ill will. (8) Mindfulness of breathing should be developed to cut off thoughts. (9) The perception of impermanence should be developed to eradicate the conceit 'I am. ${ }^{1822}$ When one perceives impermanence, the perception of non-self is stabilized. ${ }^{1823}$ One who perceives non-self eradicates the conceit 'I am,' [which is] nibbāna in this very life."

# 2 (2) Support ${ }^{1824}$

Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: "It is said, Bhante: 'Equipped with supports, equipped with supports.' In what way is a bhikkhu equipped with supports?"1825

(1) "If, bhikkhu, supported by faith, a bhikkhu abandons the unwholesome and develops the wholesome, the unwholesome is indeed abandoned by him. (2) If, supported by a sense of moral shame... (3) . . supported by moral dread ... (4) . . supported by energy ... (5) ... supported by wisdom, a bhikkhu abandons the unwholesome and develops the wholesome, that unwholesome is indeed abandoned by him. ${ }^{1826}$ [354] A bhikkhu has abandoned and well abandoned the unwholesome when he has abandoned it by seeing it with noble wisdom. ${ }^{1827}$

"Basing himself on these five things, that bhikkhu should rely on four things. ${ }^{1828}$ What four? Here, (6) having reflected, a bhikkhu uses some things; (7) having reflected, he patiently endures some things; (8) having reflected, he avoids some things; and (9) having reflected, he dispels some things.

"It is in this way, bhikkhu, that a bhikkhu is equipped with supports."

## 3 (3) Meghiya ${ }^{1829}$

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Cālikā on Mount Cālikā. ${ }^{1830}$ Now on that occasion the

Venerable Meghiya was the Blessed One's attendant. Then the Venerable Meghiya approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and said to him: "Bhante, I would like to enter Jantugama for alms."

"You may do so, Meghiya, at your own convenience."

Then, in the morning, the Venerable Meghiya dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Jantugama for alms. When he had walked for alms in Jantugama, after his meal, on returning from his alms round, he went to the bank of the Kimikāā River. As he was walking and wandering around for exercise along the bank of the Kimikāā River, the Venerable Meghiya saw [355] a lovely and delightful mango grove. It occurred to him: "This mango grove is truly lovely and delightful, suitable for the striving of a clansman intent on striving. If the Blessed One permits me, I will come back to this mango grove to strive."

Then the Venerable Meghiya approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: "This morning, Bhante, I dressed, took my bowl and robe, and entered Jantugama for alms.... [All as above, but in the first person.]...I thought: 'This mango grove is truly lovely and delightful, suitable for the striving of a clansman intent on striving. If the Blessed One permits me, I will go back to that mango grove to strive.' So if the Blessed One would permit me, I will go back to that mango grove to strive."

"As we are alone, Meghiya, wait until another bhikkhu comes along."1831

A second time the Venerable Meghiya said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, for the Blessed One there is nothing further to be done and no [need to] increase what has been done. ${ }^{1832}$ But, Bhante, I have something further to be done and [need to] increase what has been done. If the Blessed One would permit me, I will go back to that mango grove to strive."

"As we are alone, Meghiya, wait until another bhikkhu comes along." [356]

A third time the Venerable Meghiya said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, for the Blessed One there is nothing further to be done and no [need to] increase what has been done. But, Bhante, I have something further to be done and [need to] increase what has been done. If the Blessed One would permit me, I will go back to that mango grove to strive:"
"Since you speak of striving, Meghiya, what can I say to you? You may go at your own convenience."

Then the Venerable Meghiya rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and went to the mango grove. He entered and sat down at the foot of a tree to pass the day. Then, while the Venerable Meghiya was dwelling in that mango grove, three kinds of bad unwholesome thoughts frequently occurred to him: sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of harming. It then occurred to him: "This is truly astounding and amazing! I have gone forth out of faith from the household life into homelessness, yet I am still stalked by these three kinds of bad unwholesome thoughts: sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of harming."1833

Then the Venerable Meghiya approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: "Here, Bhante, while I was dwelling in that mango grove, three kinds of bad unwholesome thoughts frequently occurred to me: sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of harming. It then occurred to me: 'This is truly astounding and amazing! I have gone forth out of faith from the household life into homelessness, yet [357] I am still stalked by these three kinds of bad unwholesome thoughts: sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of harming."

"Meghiya, when liberation of mind has not matured, five things lead to its maturation. ${ }^{1834}$ What five?

(1) "Here, Meghiya, a bhikkhu has good friends, good companions, good comrades. When liberation of mind has not matured, this is the first thing that leads to its maturation.

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. When liberation of mind has not matured, this is the second thing that leads to its maturation.

(3) "Again, a bhikkhu gets to hear at will, without trouble or difficulty, talk concerned with the austere life that is conducive to opening up the heart, that is, talk on fewness of desires, on contentment, on solitude, on not getting bound up [with others], on arousing energy, on virtuous behavior, on concentration, on wisdom, on liberation, on the knowledge and vision
of liberation. When liberation of mind has not matured, this is the third thing that leads to its maturation.

(4) "Again, a bhikkhu has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities. When liberation of mind has not matured, this is the fourth thing that leads to its maturation.

(5) "Again, a bhikkhu is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. When liberation of mind has not matured, this is the fifth thing that leads to its maturation.

"When, Meghiya, a bhikkhu has good friends, good companions, good comrades, it can be expected of him that he will be virtuous, one who dwells restrained by the Pattimokkha... [358] . . . will train in them.

"When a bhikkhu has good friends, good companions, good comrades, it can be expected of him that he will get to hear at will, without trouble or difficulty, talk concerned with the austere life that is conducive to opening up the heart, that is, talk on fewness of desires... on the knowledge and vision of liberation.

"When a bhikkhu has good friends, good companions, good comrades, it can be expected of him that he will arouse energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities... not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities.

"When a bhikkhu has good friends, good companions, good comrades, it can be expected of him that he will be wise, possessing the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering.

"Having based himself on these five things, the bhikkhu should develop further [another] four things. (6) [The perception of] unattractiveness should be developed to abandon lust. (7) Loving-kindness should be developed to abandon ill will. (8) Mindfulness of breathing should be developed to cut off thoughts. (9) The perception of impermanence should be developed to eradicate the conceit 'I am.' When one perceives impermanence, the perception of non-self is stabilized. One who perceives non-self eradicates the conceit 'I am,' [which is] -nibbāna-in-this very life."

4 (4) Nandaka ${ }^{1835}$

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇ̣ika's Park. Now on that occasion the Venerable Nandaka was instructing, encouraging, inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk. Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and went to the assembly hall. He stood outside the door waiting for the talk to end. When he knew that the talk was finished, he cleared his throat [359] and tapped on the bolt. The bhikkhus opened the door for him. The Blessed One then entered the assembly hall, sat down on the seat that was prepared for him, and said to the Venerable Nandaka: "You gave the bhikkhus a long exposition of the Dhamma. My back was aching while I stood outside the door waiting for the talk to end."

When this was said, the Venerable Nandaka, feeling embarrassed, said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, I did not know that the Blessed One was standing outside the door. If I had known, I wouldn't have spoken so long."

Then the Blessed One, having understood the Venerable Nandaka's embarrassment, said to him: "Good, good, Nandaka! It is proper for clansmen like you who have gone forth out of faith from the household life into homelessness to sit together for the sake of a Dhamma talk. When you assemble, Nandaka, you should do one of two things: either talk on the Dhamma or maintain noble silence.

(1) "Nandaka, a bhikkhu may be endowed with faith but he is not virtuous; thus he is incomplete with respect to that factor. ${ }^{1836}$ He should fulfill that factor, [thinking]: 'How can I be endowed with faith [360] and also be virtuous?' But when a bhikkhu is endowed with faith and is also virtuous, then he is complete with respect to that factor.

(2) "A bhikkhu may be endowed with faith and virtuous but he does not gain internal serenity of mind; ${ }^{1837}$ thus he is incomplete with respect to that factor. He should fulfill that factor, [thinking]: 'How can I be endowed with faith and virtuous, and also gain internal serenity of mind?' But when a bhikkhu is endowed with faith and is virtuous, and also gains internal serenity of mind, then he is complete with respect to that factor.

(3) "A bhikkhu may be endowed with faith and virtuous, and he may gain internal serenity of mind, but he does not
gain the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena; ${ }^{1838}$ thus he is incomplete with respect to that factor. Just as a four-legged animal with one lame or defective leg would be incomplete with respect to that limb; so too, when a bhikkhu is endowed with faith and is virtuous, and gains internal serenity of mind, but he does not gain the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena, then he is incomplete with respect to that factor. He should fulfill that factor, [thinking]: 'How can I be endowed with faith and virtuous, gain internal serenity of mind, and also gain the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena?'

(4) But when a bhikkhu is (i) endowed with faith and (ii) it virtuous, (iii) and he gains internal serenity of mind and (iv also gains the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena, ther he is complete with respect to that factor."

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the For tunate One rose from his seat and entered his dwelling. Then not long after the Blessed One had left, the Venerable Nandak $\varepsilon$ addressed the bhikkhus: "Just now, friends, before he rose from his seat and entered his dwelling, the Blessed One revealed the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life in four terms: [361: 'Nandaka, a bhikkhu may be endowed with faith but not virtuous. . . [Nandaka here repeats the Buddha's discourse dowr to:] . . . But when a bhikkhu is endowed with faith and is virtuous, and he gains internal serenity of mind and also gains the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena, then he is complete with respect to that factor.'

"There are, friends, these five benefits in timely listening to the Dhamma, in timely discussion on the Dhamma. What five?

(5) "Here, friends, a bhikkhu teaches the bhikkhus the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; he reveals the spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure. In whatever way the bhikkhu teaches the bhikkhus the Dhamma that is good in the beginning... [and] reveals the spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure, in just that way the Teacher becomes pleasing and agreeable to him, respected and esteemed by him. ${ }^{1839}$ This is the first benefit in timely listening to the Dhamma, in timely discussion on the Dhamma.

(6) "Again, a bhikkhu teaches the bhikkhus the Dhamma that
is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; he reveals the spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure. In whatever way the bhikkhu teaches the bhikkhus the Dhamma that is good in the beginning ... [and] reveals the spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure, in just that way, in relation to that Dhamma, he experiences inspiration in the meaning and inspiration in the Dhamma. ${ }^{1840}$ This is the second benefit in timely listening to the Dhamma, in timely discussion on the Dhamma.

(7) "Again, a bhikkhu teaches the bhikkhus the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; he reveals the spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure. In whatever way the bhikkhu teaches the bhikkhus the Dhamma that is good in the beginning... [and] reveals the spiritual life that is perfectly complete and [362] pure, in just that way he sees in that Dhamma a deep and pithy matter after piercing it through with wisdom. ${ }^{1841}$ This is the third benefit in timely listening to the Dhamma, in timely discussion on the Dhamma.

(8) "Again, a bhikkhu teaches the bhikkhus the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; he reveals the spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure. In whatever way the bhikkhu teaches the bhikkhus the Dhamma that is good in the beginning ... [and] reveals the spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure, in just that way his fellow monks esteem him more highly, [thinking]: 'Surely, this venerable has attained or will attain.' This is the fourth benefit in timely listening to the Dhamma, in timely discussion on the Dhamma.

(9) "Again, a bhikkhu teaches the bhikkhus the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; he reveals the spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure. In whatever way the bhikkhu teaches the bhikkhus the Dhamma that is good in the beginning ... [and] reveals the spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure, on hearing that Dhamma those bhikkhus there who are trainees, who have not attained their heart's ideal, who dwell aspiring for the unsurpassed security from bondage, arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of
the as-yet-unrealized. But having heard that Dhamma, those bhikkhus who are arahants, whose taints are destroyed, who have lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached their own goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, and are completely liberated through final knowledge, [363] are devoted simply to a pleasant dwelling in this very life. This is the fifth benefit in timely listening to the Dhamma, in timely discussion on the Dhamma."

"These are the five benefits in timely listening to the Dhamma, in timely discussion on the Dhamma."

# 5 (5) Powers ${ }^{1842}$

"Bhikkhus, there are these four powers. What four? The power of wisdom, the power of energy, the power of blamelessness, and the power of sustaining a favorable relationship.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the power of wisdom? One has clearly seen and explored with wisdom those qualities that are unwholesome and reckoned as unwholesome; those that are wholesome and reckoned as wholesome; those that are blamable and reckoned as blamable; those that are blameless and reckoned as blameless; those that are dark and reckoned as dark; those that are bright and reckoned as bright; those that should not be cultivated and are reckoned as not to be cultivated; those that should be cultivated and are reckoned as to be cultivated; those that are unworthy of the noble ones and reckoned as unworthy of the noble ones; those that are worthy of the noble ones and reckoned as worthy of the noble ones. This is called the power of wisdom.

(2) "And what is the power of energy? One generates desire to abandon those qualities that are unwholesome and reckoned as unwholesome; those that are blamable and reckoned as blamable; those that are dark and reckoned as dark; those that should not be cultivated and are reckoned as not to be cultivated; those that are unworthy of the noble ones and reckoned as unworthy of the noble ones. One makes an effort, arouses energy, applies one's mind, and strives for this. One generates desire to obtain all those qualities that are wholesome and reckoned as wholesome; those that are blameless and reckoned as blameless; those that are bright and reckoned as bright; those that should be cultivated and are reckoned as to be cultivated; [364] those that are
worthy of the noble ones and reckoned as worthy of the noble ones. One makes an effort, arouses energy, applies one's mind, and strives for this. This is called the power of energy.

(3) "And what is the power of blamelessness? Here, a noble disciple engages in blameless bodily, verbal, and mental action. This is called the power of blamelessness.

(4) "And what is the power of sustaining a favorable relationship? There are these four means of sustaining a favorable relationship: giving, endearing speech, beneficent conduct, and impartiality. Among gifts, the best is the gift of the Dhamma. Among types of endearing speech, the best is repeatedly teaching the Dhamma to one who is interested in it and listens with eager ears. Among types of beneficent conduct, the best is when one encourages, settles, and establishes a person without faith in the accomplishment of faith, an immoral person in the accomplishment of virtuous behavior, a miserly person in the accomplishment of generosity, and an unwise person in the accomplishment of wisdom. Among types of impartiality, the best is that a stream-enterer is equal to a stream-enterer, a oncereturner is equal to a once-returner, a non-returner is equal to a non-returner, and an arahant is equal to an arahant. ${ }^{1843}$ This is called the power of sustaining a favorable relationship.

"These, bhikkhus, are the four powers. When a noble disciple possesses these four powers, he has transcended five fears. What five? (5) Fear of [loss of] livelihood, (6) fear of disrepute, (7) fear of timidity in assemblies, [365] (8) fear of death, and (9) fear of a bad destination. The noble disciple reflects thus: 'I am not afraid on account of my livelihood. Why should I be afraid on account of my livelihood? I have the four powers: the power of wisdom, the power of energy, the power of blamelessness, and the power of sustaining a favorable relationship. An unwise person might be afraid on account of his livelihood; a lazy person might be afraid on account of his livelihood; a person who engages in blamable bodily, verbal, and mental action might be afraid on account of his livelihood; a person who does not sustain favorable relationships might be afraid on account of his livelihood.

"I am not afraid of disrepute.... I am not afraid of timidity in assemblies. . . I am not afraid of death. . . I am not afraid of a bad destination. Why should I be afraid of a bad destination? I have
the four powers: the power of wisdom, the power of energy, the power of blamelessness, and the power of sustaining a favorable relationship. An unwise person might be afraid of a bad destination; a lazy person might be afraid of a bad destination; a person who engages in blamable bodily, verbal, and mental action might be afraid of a bad destination; a person who does not sustain favorable relationships might be afraid of a bad destination.'

"When a noble disciple possesses these four powers, he has transcended these five fears."

# 6 (6) Association

There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend!" those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:

"Friends, persons should be understood to be twofold: those to be associated with and those not to be associated with. ${ }^{1844}$ Robes, too, should be understood to be twofold: those to be used and those not to be used. Almsfood . . . Lodgings, too, should be understood to be twofold: those to be used and those not to be used. Villages or towns should be understood to be twofold: those to be resorted to and [366] those not to be resorted to. Countries or regions should be understood to be twofold: those to be resorted to and those not to be resorted to.

(1) "When it was said: 'Persons, friends, should be understood to be twofold: those to be associated with and those not to be associated with,' for what reason was this said? If one knows of a person: 'When I associate with this person, unwholesome qualities increase in me and wholesome qualities decline; and the requisites of life that should be obtained by one gone forthrobes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick-are obtained with difficulty; and the goal of the ascetic life for the sake of which I have gone forth from the household life into homelessness does not reach fulfillment by development for me,' in that case one should depart from that person any time night or day, ${ }^{1845}$ even without taking leave of him. One should not continue to follow him. ${ }^{1846}$

(2) "If one knows of a person: 'When I associate with this person, unwholesome qualities increase in me and wholesome qualities decline; but the requisites of life that should be obtained
by one gone forth-robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick-are obtained without difficulty; but still, the goal of the ascetic life, for the sake of which I have gone forth from the household life into homelessness, does not reach fulfillment by development for me,' in that case, having reflected, one should depart from that person after taking leave of him. ${ }^{1847}$ One should not continue to follow him.

(3) "If one knows of a person: 'When I associate with this person, unwholesome [367] qualities decline in me and wholesome qualities increase; but the requisites of life that should be obtained by one gone forth-robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick-are obtained with difficulty; still, the goal of the ascetic life, for the sake of which I have gone forth from the household life into homelessness, reaches fulfillment by development for me,' in that case, having reflected, one should continue to follow that person.

One should not depart from him even if one is dismissed.

"When it was said: Persons, friends, should be understood to be twofold: those to be associated with and those not to be associated with,' it is because of this that this was said.

(5) "When it was said: 'Robes, friends, should be understood to be twofold: those to be used and those not to be used,' for what reason was this said? If one knows of a robe: 'When I use this robe, unwholesome qualities increase in me and wholesome qualities decline,' one should not use such a robe. But if one knows of a robe: 'When I use this robe, unwholesome qualities decline in me and wholesome qualities increase,' one should use such a robe. [368] When it was said: 'Robes, friends, should be understood to be twofold: those to be used and those not to be used,' it is because of this that this was said.
(6) "When it was said: 'Almsfood, friends, should be understood to be twofold: that to be used and that not to be used,' for what reason was this said? If one knows of some almsfood: 'When I use this almsfood, unwholesome qualities increase in me and wholesome qualities decline,' one should not use such almsfood. But if one knows of some almsfood: 'When I use this almsfood, unwholesome qualities decline in me and wholesome qualities increase,' one should use such almsfood. When it was said: 'Almsfood, friends, should be understood to be twofold: that to be used and that not to be used,' it is because of this that this was said.

(7) "When it was said: 'Lodgings, friends, should be understood to be twofold: those to be used and those not to be used,' for what reason was this said? If one knows of a lodging: 'When I use this lodging, unwholesome qualities increase in me and wholesome qualities decline,' one should not use such a lodging. But if one knows of a lodging: 'When I use this lodging, unwholesome qualities decline in me and wholesome qualities increase,' one should use such a lodging. When it was said: 'Lodgings, friends, should be understood to be twofold: those to be used and those not to be used,' it is because of this that this was said.

(8) "When it was said: 'Villages or towns, friends, should be understood to be twofold: those to be resorted to and those not to be resorted to,' for what reason was this said? If one knows of a village or town: 'When I resort to this village or town, unwholesome qualities increase in me and wholesome qualities decline,' one should not resort to such a village or town. But if one knows of a village or town: 'When I resort to this village [369] or town, unwholesome qualities decline in me and wholesome qualities increase,' one should resort to such a village or town. When it was said: 'Villages or towns, friends, should be understood to be twofold: those to be resorted to and those not to be resorted to,' it is because of this that this was said.

(9) "When it was said: 'Countries or regions, friends, should be understood to be twofold: those to be resorted to and those not to be resorted to,' for what reason was this said? If one knows of a country or region: 'When I resort to this country or region, unwholesome qualities increase in me and wholesome qualities decline,' one should not resort to such a country or

When it was said: 'Countries or regions, friends, should be understood to be twofold: those to be resorted to and those not to be resorted to,' it is because of this that this was said."

# 7 (7) Sutavā

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Then the wanderer Sutavā approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

"Bhante, on one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling right here in Rājagaha, the Mountain Fort. ${ }^{1048}$ At that time, in the presence of the Blessed One, I heard and learned this: 'Sutavā, a bhikkhu who is an arahant-one whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, laid down [370] the burden, reached his own goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, one completely liberated through final knowledge-is incapable of transgression in five cases. He is incapable of intentionally depriving a living being of life; he is incapable of taking by way of theft what is not given; he is incapable of engaging in sexual intercourse; he is incapable of deliberately speaking falsehood; he is incapable of storing things up in order to enjoy sensual pleasures as he did in the past when a layman.' Bhante, did I hear that correctly from the Blessed One, grasp it correctly, attend to it correctly, remember it correctly?"

"Yes, Sutavā, you heard that correctly, grasped it correctly, attended to it correctly, remembered it correctly. In the past, Sutavā, and also now I say thus: 'A bhikkhu who is an arahantone whose taints are destroyed... one completely liberated through final knowledge-is incapable of transgression in nine cases. (1) He is incapable of intentionally depriving a living being of life; (2) he is incapable of taking by way of theft what is not given; (3) he is incapable of engaging in sexual intercourse; (4) he is incapable of deliberately speaking falsehood; (5) he is incapable of storing things up in order to enjoy sensual
pleasures as he did in the past when a layman; (6) he is incapable of rejecting the Buddha; (7) he is incapable of rejecting the Dhamma; (8) he is incapable of rejecting the Sangha; (9) he is incapable of rejecting the training. ${ }^{1819}$ [371] In the past, Sutavā, and also now I say thus: 'A bhikkhu who is an arahant-one whose taints are destroyed... one completely liberated through final knowledge-is incapable of transgression in these nine cases.'"

# 8 (8) Sajjha

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Then the wanderer Sajjha approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

"Bhante, on one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling right here in Rajagaha.... [as in 9:7]... Bhante, did I hear that correctly from the Blessed One, grasp it correctly, attend to it correctly, remember it correctly?" [372]

"Yes, Sajjha, you heard that correctly, grasped it correctly, attended to it correctly, remembered it correctly. In the past, Sajjha, and also now I say thus: 'A bhikkhu who is an arahantone whose taints are destroyed... one completely liberated through final knowledge-is incapable of transgression in nine cases. (1) He is incapable of intentionally depriving a living being of life; (2) he is incapable of taking by way of theft what is not given; (3) he is incapable of engaging in sexual intercourse; (4) he is incapable of deliberately speaking falsehood; (5) he is incapable of storing things up in order to enjoy sensual pleasures as he did in the past when a layman; (6) he is incapable of entering upon a wrong course on account of desire; (7) he is incapable of entering upon a wrong course on account of hatred; (8) he is incapable of entering upon a wrong course on account of delusion; (9) he is incapable of entering upon a wrong course on account of fear.' In the past, Sajjha, and also now I say thus: 'A bhikkhu who is an arahant-one whose taints are destroyed... one completely liberated through final knowledge-is incapable of transgression in these nine cases.'"

9 (9) Persons

"Bhikkhus, there are these nine kinds of persons found existing in the world. What nine? The arahant, the one practicing for arahantship; the non-returner, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of non-returning; the once-returner, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of once-returning; the stream-enterer, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of stream-entry; the worldling. These are the nine kinds of persons found existing in the world." [373]

# 10 (10) Worthy of Gifts

"Bhikkhus, these nine persons are worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What nine? The arahant, the one practicing for arahantship; the non-returner, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of non-returning; the once-returner, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of once-returning; the stream-enterer, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of stream-entry; the clan member. ${ }^{1850}$ These nine persons are worthy of gifts ... an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

## II. The Lion's Roar

## 11 (1) Lion's Roar

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇ̣ika's Park. Then the Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, I have completed the rains residence at Sāvatthī. I want to depart on a tour of the countryside."

"You may go, Sāriputta, at your own convenience."

Then the Venerable Sāriputta rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed. [374] Then, not long after the Venerable Sāriputta had left, a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, the Venerable Sāriputta struck me and then set out on tour without apologizing. ${ }^{11851}$

Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu: "Go,
bhikkhu, in my name call Sāriputta, [telling him]: 'The Teacher is calling you, friend Sāriputta. ${ }^{\prime \prime 1852}$

"Yes, Bhante," that bhikkhu replied. Then he approached the Venerable Sāriputta and said: "The Teacher is calling you, friend Sariputta."

"Yes, friend," the Venerable Sāriputta replied.

Now on that occasion the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna and the Venerable Ānanda took a key and wandered from dwelling to dwelling, [calling out]: "Come forth, venerables! Come forth, venerables! Now the Venerable Sāriputta will roar his lion's roar in the presence of the Blessed One!"

Then the Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One said to him: "Sāriputta, one of your fellow monks has made a complaint about you, [saying]: 'Bhante, the Venerable Sāriputta struck me and then set out on tour without apologizing.'"

(1) "Bhante, one who has not established mindfulness directed to the body in regard to his own body might strike a fellow monk and then set out on tour without apologizing. Just as they throw pure and impure things on the earth-feces, urine, spittle, pus, and blood-yet the earth is not repelled, humiliated, or disgusted because of this; so [375] too, Bhante, I dwell with a mind like the earth, vast, exalted, and measureless, without enmity and ill will.

(2) "Bhante, one who has not established mindfulness directed to the body in regard to his own body might strike a fellow monk and then set out on tour without apologizing. Just as they wash pure and impure things in water-feces, urine, spittle, pus, and blood-yet the water is not repelled, humiliated, or disgusted because of this; so too, Bhante, I dwell with a mind like water, vast, exalted, and measureless, without enmity and ill will.

(3) "Bhante, one who has not established mindfulness directed to the body in regard to his own body might strike a fellow monk and then set out on tour without apologizing. Just as fire burns pure and impure things-feces, urine, spittle, pus, and blood-yet the fire is not repelled, humiliated, or disgusted because of this; so too, Bhante, I dwell with a mind like fire, vast, exalted, and measureless, without enmity and ill will.

(4) "Bhante, one who has not established mindfulness directed
to the body in regard to his own body might strike a fellow monk and then set out on tour without apologizing. Just as air blows upon pure and impure things-feces, urine, spittle, pus, and blood-yet the air is not repelled, humiliated, or disgusted because of this; so too, Bhante, I dwell with a mind like air, vast, exalted, and measureless, without enmity and ill will.

(5) "Bhante, one who has not established mindfulness directed to the body in regard to his own body might strike a fellow monk and then set out on tour without apologizing. [376] Just as a duster wipes off pure and impure things-feces, urine, spittle, pus, and blood-yet the duster is not repelled, humiliated, or disgusted because of this; so too, Bhante, I dwell with a mind like a duster, vast, exalted, and measureless, without enmity and ill will.

(6) "Bhante, one who has not established mindfulness directed to the body in regard to his own body might strike a fellow monk and then set out on tour without apologizing. Just as an outcast boy or girl, clad in rags and holding a vessel, enters a village or town with a humble mind; so too, Bhante, I dwell with a mind like an outcast boy, vast, exalted, and measureless, without enmity and ill will.

(7) "Bhante, one who has not established mindfulness directed to the body in regard to his own body might strike a fellow monk and then set out on tour.without apologizing. Just as a bull with his horns cut, mild, well tamed and well trained, wanders from street to street and from square to square without hurting anyone with its feet or horns; so too, Bhante, I dwell with a mind like that of a bull with horns cut, vast, exalted, and measureless, without enmity and ill will.

(8) "Bhante, one who has not established mindfulness directed to the body in regard to his own body might strike a fellow monk and then set out on tour without apologizing. Just as a woman or a man-young, youthful, and fond of ornaments, with head bathed-would be [377] repelled, humiliated, and disgusted if the carcass of a snake, a dog, or a human being were slung around her or his neck; so too, Bhante, I am repelled, humiliated, and disgusted by this foul body.

(9) "Bhante, one who has not established mindfulness directed to the body in regard to his own body might strike a fellow monk and then set out on tour without apologizing. Just
as a person might carry around a cracked and perforated bowl of liquid fat that oozes and drips; so too, Bhante, I carry around this cracked and perforated body that oozes and drips.

"Bhante, one who has not established mindfulness directed to the body in regard to his own body might strike a fellow monk here and then set out on tour without apologizing."

Then that [accusing] bhikkhu rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, prostrated himself with his head at the Blessed One's feet, and said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, I have committed a transgression in that I so foolishly, stupidly, and unskillfully slandered the Venerable Sāriputta on grounds that are untrue, baseless, and false. Bhante, may the Blessed One accept my transgression seen as a transgression for the sake of future restraint."

"Surely, bhikkhu, you have committed a transgression in that you so foolishly, stupidly, and unskillfully slandered the Venerable Sāriputta on grounds that are untrue, baseless, and false. But since you see your transgression as a transgression and make amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma; we accept it. For it is growth in the Noble One's discipline that one sees one's transgression as a transgression, makes amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma, and undertakes future restraint." [378]

The Blessed One then addressed the Venerable Sāriputta: "Sāriputta, pardon this hollow man before his head splits into seven pieces right there."

"I will pardon this venerable one, Bhante, if this venerable one says to me: 'And let the venerable one pardon me." "1853

# 12 (2) With Residue Remaining

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Then, in the morning, the Venerable Sāriputta dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Sāvatthī for alms. It then occurred to him: "It is still too early to walk for alms in Sāvatthī. Let me go to the park of the wanderers of other sects."1854

Then the Venerable Sāriputta went to the park of the wanderers of other sects. He exchanged greetings with those wanderers and, when they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, sat down to one side. Now on that occasion those wanderers had assembled and were sitting together when this conversation
arose among them: "Friends, anyone who passes away with a residue remaining is not freed from hell, the animal realm, or the sphere of afflicted spirits; he is not freed from the plane of misery, the bad destination, the lower world."

Then the Venerable Sāriputta neither delighted in nor rejected the statement of those wanderers, but rose from his seat and left, [thinking]: "I shall find out what the Blessed One has to say about this statement."

Then, when the Venerable Sāriputta had walked for alms in Sāvatthī, [379] after his meal, on returning from his alms round, he approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. [He here reports verbatim the entire course of events and ends:] "I rose from my seat and left, [thinking]: 'I shall find out what the Blessed One has to say about this statement."

"Who, ${ }^{1855}$ Sāriputta, are those foolish and incompetent wanderers of other sects and who are those that know one with a residue remaining as 'one with a residue remaining' and one without residue remaining as 'one without residue remaining'? ${ }^{1856}$

"These nine persons, Sāriputta, passing away with a residue remaining, are freed from hell, the animal realm, and the sphere of afflicted spirits; freed from the plane of misery, the bad destination, the lower world. What nine? [380]

(1) "Here, Sāriputta, some person fulfills virtuous behavior and concentration but cultivates wisdom only to a moderate extent. ${ }^{1857}$ With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, this person is an attainer of nibbāna in the interval. This is the first person, passing away with a residue remaining, who is freed from hell, the animal realm, and the sphere of afflicted spirits; freed from the plane of misery, the bad destination, the lower world.

(2)-(5) "Again, some person fulfills virtuous behavior and concentration but cultivates wisdom only to a moderate extent. With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, this person is an attainer of nibbāna upon landing... an attainer of nibbāna without exertion... an attainer of nibbāna through exertion . . . one bound upstream, heading toward the Akanittha realm. This is the fifth person, passing away with a residue remaining, who is freed from hell . . . the lower world.

(6) "Again, some person fulfills virtuous behavior but cultivates concentration and wisdom only to a moderate extent.

With the utter destruction of three fetters and with the diminishing of greed, hatred, and delusion, this person is a oncereturner who, after coming back to this world only one more time, makes an end of suffering. This is the sixth person, passing away with a residue remaining, who is freed from hell... the lower world.

(7) "Again, some person fulfills virtuous behavior but cultivates concentration and wisdom only to a moderate extent. With the utter destruction of three fetters, this person is a oneseed attainer who, after being reborn once more as a human being, [381] makes an end of suffering. This is the seventh person, passing away with a residue remaining, who is freed from hell ... the lower world.

(8) "Again, some person fulfills virtuous behavior but cultivates concentration and wisdom only to a moderate extent. With the utter destruction of three fetters, this person is a family-to-family attainer who, after roaming and wandering on among good families two or three times, makes an end of suffering. This is the eighth person, passing away with a residue remaining, who is freed from hell... the lower world.

(9) "Again, some person fulfills virtuous behavior but cultivates concentration and wisdom only to a moderate extent. With the utter destruction of three fetters, this person is a seven-times-at-most attainer who, after roaming and wandering on among devas and humans seven times at most, makes an end of suffering. This is the ninth person, passing away with a residue remaining, who is freed from hell, the animal realm, and the sphere of afflicted spirits; freed from the plane of misery, the bad destination, the lower world.

"Who, Sāriputta, are those foolish and incompetent wanderers of other sects, and who are those that know one with a residue remaining as 'one with a residue remaining' and one without residue remaining as 'one without residue remaining'?

"These nine persons, passing away with a residue remaining, are freed from hell, the animal realm, and the sphere of afflicted spirits; freed from the plane of misery, the bad destination, the lower world. Sāriputta, I had not been disposed to give this Dhamma exposition to the bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, -male lay followers, and female lay followers. For what reason?

I was concerned that on hearing this Dhamma exposition, they might take to the ways of heedlessness. [382] However, I have spoken this Dhamma exposition for the purpose of answering your question. ${ }^{\prime 1858}$

# 13 (3) Kotthita

Then the Venerable Mahākotṭhita approached the Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Sāriputta:

"Now, friend Sāriputta, is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: 'Let kamma [whose result] is to be experienced in this life become kamma [whose result] I am to experience in a future life'?"1859

"Certainly not, friend."

"Then is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: 'Let kamma [whose result] is to be experienced in a future life become kamma [whose result] I am to experience in this life'?".

"Certainly not, friend."

"Now, friend Sāriputta, is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: 'Let kamma [whose result] is to be experienced as pleasant become kamma [whose result] I am to experience as painful?"1860

"Certainly not, friend."

"Then is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: 'Let kamma [whose result] is to be experienced as painful become kamma [whose result] I am to experience as pleasant '?"

"Certainly not, friend."

"Now, friend Sāriputta, is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: 'Let my kamma [whose result] is to be experienced when it has matured become kamma [whose result] I am to experience while it has not matured'?"1861

"Certainly not, friend."

"Then is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: 'Let kamma [whose result] is to be experienced while it has not matured become kamma [whose result] I am to experience when it has matured'?"

"Certainly not, friend."
"Now, friend Sāriputta, is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: 'Let kamma [whose result] is to be experienced copiously become kamma [whose result] I am to experience just slightly'?"

"Certainly not, friend."

"Then [383] is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: 'Let kamma [whose result] is to be experienced just slightly become kamma [whose result] I am to experience copiously'?"

"Certainly not, friend."

"Now, friend Sāriputta, is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: 'Let kamma [whose result] is to be experienced become kamma [whose result] I am not to experience'?"1862

"Certainly not, friend."

"Then is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: 'Let kamma [whose result] is not to be experienced become kamma [whose result] I am to experience'?"

"Certainly not, friend."1863

"Friend Sāriputta, when you are asked: 'Now, friend Sāriputta, is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: "Let kamma [whose result] is to be experienced in this life become kamma [whose result] I am to experience in a future life"?' you say: 'Certainly not, friend.' And when you are asked: 'Then is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: "Let kamma [whose result] is to be experienced in a future life become kamma [whose result] I am to experience in this life"?' you say: 'Certainly not, friend.' ... [384]... When you are asked: 'Now, friend Sāriputta, is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: "Let kamma [whose result] is to be experienced become kamma [whose result] I am not to experience"?' you say: 'Certainly not, friend.' And when you are asked: 'Then is the spiritual life lived under the Blessed One for this purpose: "Let kamma [whose result] is not to be experienced become kamma [whose result] I am to experience"?' you say: 'Certainly not, friend.' Then for what purpose does one live the spiritual life under the Blessed One?"

"One lives the spiritual life under the Blessed One, friend, for the purpose of knowing, seeing, attaining, realizing, and penetrating what one has not known, seen, attained, realized, and penetrated."
"But, friend, what is it that one has not known, seen, attained, realized, and penetrated?"

"'This is suffering,' friend, is what one has not known, seen, attained, realized, and penetrated, and it is for the purpose of knowing, seeing, attaining, realizing, and penetrating this that one lives the spiritual life under the Blessed One. [385] 'This is the origin of suffering'... 'This is the cessation of suffering'... 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering' is what one has not known, seen, attained, realized, and penetrated, and it is for the purpose of knowing, seeing, attaining, realizing, and penetrating this that one lives the spiritual life under the Blessed One. This, friend, is what one has not known, seen, attained, realized, and penetrated, and it is for the purpose of knowing, seeing, attaining, realizing, and penetrating this that one lives the spiritual life under the Blessed One."

# 14 (4) Samiddhi

Then the Venerable Samiddhi approached the Venerable Sāriputta, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Venerable Sariputta then said to him: ${ }^{1864}$

(1) "On what basis, Samiddhi, do intentions and thoughts ${ }^{1865}$ arise in a person?"

"On the basis of name-and-form, Bhante."1866

(2) "Where do they become diversified?"

"In relation to the elements."

(3) "From what do they originate?"

"They originate from contact."

(4) "Upon what do they converge?"

"They converge upon feeling."1867

(5) "By what are they headed?"

"They are headed by concentration."

(6) "What exercises authority over them?"

"Mindfulness exercises authority over them."

(7) "What is their supervisor?"

"Wisdom is their supervisor."

(8) "What is their core?"

"Liberation is their core."1868

(9) "In what do they culminate?"

"They culminate in the deathless."1869

"When you were asked: 'On what basis, Samiddhi, do intentions and thoughts arise in a person?' you said: 'On the basis
of name-and-form, Bhante.' ... [386]... When you were asked: 'In what do they culminate?' you said: 'They culminate in the deathless.' Good, good, Samiddhi! When you were asked such questions, you answered well, but don't become conceited because of that."

# 15 (5) Boil

"Bhikkhus, suppose there was a boil many years old. It would have nine wound orifices, nine natural orifices. ${ }^{1870}$ Whatever would flow out from them would be impure, foul-smelling, and disgusting. Whatever would ooze out from them would be impure, foul-smelling, and disgusting.

"'A boil,' bhikkhus, is a designation for this body consisting of the four great elements, originating from mother and father, built up out of rice and gruel, subject to impermanence, to kneading and abrasion, to breaking apart and dispersal. It has nine wound orifices, nine natural orifices. Whatever flows out from them is impure, foul-smelling, and disgusting. [387] Whatever oozes out from them is impure, foul-smelling, and disgusting. Therefore, bhikkhus, become disenchanted with this body."

## 16 (6) Perceptions

"Bhikkhus, these nine perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are of great fruit and benefit, culminating in the deathless, having the deathless as their consummation. ${ }^{1871}$ What nine? The perception of unattractiveness, the perception of death, the perception of the repulsiveness of food, the perception of nondelight in the entire world, the perception of impermanence, the perception of suffering in the impermanent, the perception of non-self in what is suffering, the perception of abandoning, and the perception of dispassion. These nine perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are of great fruit and benefit, culminating in the deathless, having the deathless as their consummation."

## 17 (7) Families

"Bhikkhus, possessing nine factors, a family that has not yet been approached is not worth approaching, or one that has been approached is not worth sitting with. ${ }^{1872}$ What nine? (1)

They do not rise up in an agreeable way. ${ }^{1873}$ (2) They do not pay homage in an agreeable way. ${ }^{1874}$ (3) They do not offer a seat in an agreeable way. (4) They hide what they have from one. (5) Even when they have much, they give little. (6) Even when they have excellent things, they give coarse things. (7) They give without respect, not respectfully. (8) They do not sit close by to listen to the Dhamma. (9) They do not savor the flavor of one's words: Possessing these nine factors, a family that has not yet been approached is not worth approaching, and one that has been approached is not worth sitting with.

"Bhikkhus, possessing nine factors, a family that has not yet been approached is worth approaching or one that has been approached is worth sitting with. What nine?

(8) They sit close by to listen to the Dhamma. (9) They savor the flavor of one's words. Possessing these nine factors, a family that has not yet been approached is worth approaching, and one that has been approached is worth sitting with."

# 18 (8) Loving-Kindness

"Bhikkhus, when it is observed complete in nine factors, the uposatha is of great fruit and benefit, very brilliant and pervasive. ${ }^{1875}$ And how is the uposatha observed complete in nine factors, so that it is of great fruit and benefit, extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive?

(1) "Here, bhikkhus, a noble disciple reflects thus: 'As long as they live the arahants abandon and abstain from the destruction of life; with the rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious and kindly, they dwell compassionate toward all living beings. Today, for this night and day, I too shall abandon and abstain from the destruction of life; with the rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious and kindly, I too shall dwell compassionate toward all living beings. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.' This is the first factor it possesses.

(2) "'As long as they live the arahants abandon and abstain
from taking what is not given; they take only what is given, expect only what is given, and dwell honestly without thoughts of theft. Today, for this night and day, I too shall abandon and abstain from taking what is not given; I shall accept only what is given, expect only what is given, and dwell honestly without thoughts of theft. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.' This is the second factor it possesses. [389]

(3) "'As long as they live the arahants abandon sexual activity and observe celibacy, living apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the common person's practice. Today, for this night and day, I too shall abandon sexual activity and observe celibacy, living apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the common person's practice. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.' This is the third factor it possesses.

(4) "As long as they live the arahants abandon and abstain from false speech; they speak truth, adhere to truth; they are trustworthy and reliable, no deceivers of the world. Today, for this night and day, I too shall abandon and abstain from false speech; I shall be a speaker of truth, an adherent of truth, trustworthy and reliable, no deceiver of the world. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.' This is the fourth factor it possesses.

(5) "'As long as they live the arahants abandon and abstain from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Today, for this night and day, I too shall abandon and abstain from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.' This is the fifth factor it possesses.

(6) "'As long as they live the arahants eat once a day, abstaining from eating at night and from food outside the proper time. Today, for this night and day, I too shall eat once a day, abstaining from eating at night and from food outside the proper time. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.' This is the sixth factor it possesses.

(7) "'As long as they live the arahants abstain from dancing, singing, instrumental music, and unsuitable shows, and from adorning and beautifying themselves by wearing garlands and applying scents and unguents. Today, for this night and day,

I too shall abstain from dancing, singing, instrumental music, and unsuitable shows, and from adorning and beautifying myself by wearing garlands and applying scents and unguents. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.' This is the seventh factor it possesses.

(8) "'As long as they live the arahants abandon and abstain from the use of high and luxurious beds; they lie down on a low resting place, [390] either a small bed or a straw mat. Today, for this night and day, I too shall abandon and abstain from the use of high and luxurious beds; I shall lie down on a low resting place, either a small bed or a straw mat. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.' This is the eighth factor it possesses:

(9) "Here, a noble disciple dwells pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, likewise the second quarter, the third quarter, and the fourth quarter. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will. This is the ninth factor it possesses.

"It is in this way, bhikkhus, that the uposatha is observed complete in nine factors, so that it is of great fruit and benefit, extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive."

# 19 (9) Deities

"Bhikkhus, last night, when the night had advanced, a number of deities of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta's Grove, approached me, paid homage to me, and stood to one side.

(1) "Those deities then said: 'In the past, Bhante, when we were human beings, monks approached our homes. We rose up for them but did not pay homage to them. Not having fulfilled our duty, full of regret and remorse, we were reborn in an inferior class [of deities].' [391]

(2) "Some other deities approached me and said: 'In the past, Bhante, when we were human beings, monks approached our homes. We rose up for them and paid homage to them, but we did not offer them seats. Not having fulfilled our duty, full of regret and remorse, we were reborn in an inferior class [of deities].'
(3) "Some other deities approached me and said: 'In the past, Bhante, when we were human beings, monks approached our homes.

(8) ... we examined the meaning of the teachings that had been retained in mind but we did not understand the meaning and the Dhamma and then practice in accordance with the Dhamma. Not having fulfilled our duty, full of regret and remorse, we were reborn in an inferior class [of deities].'

(9) "Some other deities approached me and said: 'In the past, Bhante, when we were human beings, monks approached our homes. (i) We rose up for them, (ii) paid homage to them, (iii) offered them seats, and [392] (iv) shared things with them to the best of our ability and capacity. (v) We sat close by to listen to the Dhamma and (vi) listened to it with eager ears; (vii) having heard it, we retained the Dhamma in mind; (viii) we examined the meaning of the teachings that had been retained in mind; and (ix) we understood the meaning and the Dhamma and then practiced in accordance with the Dhamma. Having fulfilled our duty, free of regret and remorse, we were reborn in a superior class [of deities].'

"These are the feet of trees, bhikkhus, these are empty huts. Meditate, bhikkhus, do not be heedless. Do not have cause to regret it later, like those prior deities."

# 20 (10) Velāma

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Then the householder Anāthapindika approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One asked him:

"Are alms given in your family, householder?"

"Alms are given in my family, Bhante, but they consist of broken rice accompanied by rice gruel. ${ }^{\prime 1876}$
"If, householder, one gives alms, coarse or excellent, and one gives disrespectfully, gives inconsiderately, does not give with one's own hand, gives what would be discarded, gives without a view of future consequences, ${ }^{1877}$ then wherever the result of that gift is produced for one, one's mind does not incline toward the enjoyment of superb food, nor toward the enjoyment of superb clothing, nor toward the enjoyment of superb vehicles, nor toward the enjoyment of whatever is superb among the five objects of sensual pleasure. Also, one's [393] children and wives, and one's slaves, servants, and workers, do not want to listen to one, do not lend an ear, and do not apply their minds to understand. For what reason? Just this is the result of actions that are done disrespectfully.

"If, householder, one gives alms, whether coarse or excellent, and one gives respectfully, gives considerately, gives with one's own hand, gives what would not be discarded, gives with a view of future consequences, then wherever the result of that gift is produced for one, one's mind inclines toward the enjoyment of superb food; toward the enjoyment of superb clothing, toward the enjoyment of superb vehicles, toward the enjoyment of whatever is superb among the five objects of sensual pleasure. Also, one's children and wives, and one's slaves, servants, and workers, want to listen to one, lend an ear, and apply their minds to understand. For what reason? Just this is the result of actions that are done respectfully.

"In the past, householder, there was a brahmin named Velāma. He gave such a great alms offering as this: ${ }^{1878}$ (1) eightyfour thousand golden bowls filled with silver; (2) eighty-four thousand silver bowls filled with gold; (3) eighty-four thousand bronze bowls filled with bullion; (4) eighty-four thousand elephants with golden ornaments, golden banners, covered with nets of gold thread; (5) eighty-four thousand chariots with upholstery of lion skins, tiger skins, leopard skins, and saffron-dyed blankets, with golden ornaments, golden banners, covered with nets of gold thread; (6) eighty-four thousand milk cows with jute tethers ${ }^{1879}$ and bronze pails; ${ }^{1880}$ (7) eighty-four thousand maidens adorned with jeweled earrings; (8) eightyfour thousand couches [394] spread with rugs, blankets, and covers, with excellent coverings of antelope hide, with canopies and red bolsters at both ends; (9) eighty-four thousand kūtis ${ }^{1881}$ of cloths made of fine linen, fine silk, fine wool, and fine cotton.

How much more of food and drink, snacks, meals, refreshments, and beverages? ${ }^{1882}$ It seemed to be flowing like rivers.

"You might think, householder: 'He was someone else, the brahmin Velāma who on that occasion gave that great alms offering.' But you should not look at it in such a way. I myself was the brahmin Velāma who on that occasion gave that great alms offering.

"Now, householder, at that alms offering there was no one worthy of offerings, no one who purified the offering. Even more fruitful than the great alms offering that the brahmin Velāma gave would it be to feed-one person accomplished in view. Even more fruitful than the great alms offering that the brahmin Velāma gave, and feeding a hundred persons accomplished in view, would it be to feed one once-returner. Even more fruitful than the great alms. offering that the brahmin Velāma gave, and feeding a hundred once-returners, would it be to feed one non-returner. Even more fruitful than... feeding a hundred non-returners, would it be to feed one arahant. Even more fruitful than...feeding a hundred arahants, would it be to feed one pacekabuddha. [395] Even more fruitful than...feeding a hundred pacekabuddhas, would it be to feed the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One . . . would it be to feed the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha... would it be to build a dwelling dedicated to the Sangha of the four quarters ... would it be for one with a mind of confidence to go for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha... would it be for one with a mind of confidence to undertake the five training rules: to abstain from the destruction of life, to abstain from taking what is not given, to abstain from sexual misconduct, to abstain from false speech, to abstain from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Even more fruitful... would it be to develop a mind of loving-kindness even for the time it takes to pull a cow's udder.

"Even more fruitful, householder, than the great alms offering that the brahmin Velāma gave, and feeding one person accomplished in view, and feeding a hundred persons accomplished in view; and feeding one once-returner, and feeding a hundred once-returners; and feeding one non-returner, and feeding a hundred non-returners; and feeding one arahant, and
feeding a hundred arahants; and feeding one paccekabuddha, and feeding a hundred paccekabuddhas; and feeding the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One; and feeding the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha; and building a dwelling dedicated to the Sangha of the four quarters; and for one with a mind of confidence to go for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha; and for one with a mind of confidence to undertake the five training rules: to abstain from the destruction of life ... to abstain from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness; and for one to develop a mind of loving-kindness even for the time it takes to pull a cow's udder, [396] would it be to develop the perception of impermanence just for the time of a finger snap."1883

# III. AbOÔES OF BEINGS

## 21 (1) Respects.

"Bhikkhus, in three respects the people of Uttarakuru surpass the Tāvatimsa devas and the people of Jambudīpa. ${ }^{1884}$ What three? (1) They are without selfishness and possessiveness; (2) their life span is fixed; and (3) their living conditions are exceptional. ${ }^{1885}$ In these three respects the people of Uttarakuru surpass the Tāvatimsa devas and the people of Jambudīpa.

"In three respects the Tāvatimsa devas surpass the people of Uttarakuru and the people of Jambudīpa. What three? (4) In celestial life span, (5) in celestial beauty, and (5) in celestial happiness. In these three respects the Tāvatimsa devas surpass the people of Uttarakuru and the people of Jambudīpa.

"In three respects the people of Jambudīpa surpass the people of Uttarakuru and the Tāvatimsa devas. What three? (7) They are heroes; (8) they are mindful; and (9) there is the living of the spiritual life here. In these three respects the people of Jambūdīpa surpass the people of Uttarakuru and the Tāvatimsa devas." [397]

## 22 (2) Wild Colts

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you the three kinds of wild colts and the three kinds of persons who are like wild colts; the three kinds of good horses and the three kinds of persons who are like good horses; the three kinds of excellent thoroughbred horses and
the three kinds of excellent thoroughbred persons. ${ }^{1886}$ Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"And what, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of wild colts? (1) Here, one kind of wild colt possesses speed but not beauty or the right proportions. (2) Another kind of wild colt possesses speed and beauty but not the right proportions. (3) And still another kind of wild colt possesses speed, beauty, and the right proportions. These are the three kinds of wild colts.

"And what, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons who are like wild colts? (1) Here, one kind of person who is like a wild colt possesses speed but not beauty or the right proportions. (2) Another kind of person who is like a wild colt possesses speed and beauty but not the right proportions. (3) And still another kind of person who is like a wild colt possesses speed, beauty, and the right proportions.

(1) "And how, bhikkhus, does a person who is like a wild colt possess speed but not beauty or the right proportions? Here, a bhikkhu understands as it really is: 'This is suffering,' and 'This is the origin of suffering,' and 'This is the cessation of suffering,' and 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' [398] This, I say, is his speed. But when asked a question pertaining to the Dhamma or the discipline, he falters and does not answer. This, I say, is his lack of beauty. And he does not gain robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick. This, I say, is his lack of the right proportions. In this way a person who is like a wild colt possesses speed but not beauty or the right proportions.

(2) "And how does a person who is like a wild colt possess speed and beauty but not the right proportions? Here, a bhikkhu understands as it really is:,'This is suffering'... 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' This, I say, is his speed. And when asked a question pertaining to the Dhamma or the discipline, he answers and does not falter. This, I say, is his beauty. But he does not gain robes . . . and provisions for the sick. This, I say, is his lack of the right proportions. In this way a person who is like a wild colt possesses speed and beauty but not the right proportions.

(3) "And how does a person who is like a wild colt possess
speed, beauty, and the right proportions? Here, a bhikkhu understands as it really is: 'This is suffering'...'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' This, I say, is his speed. And when asked a question pertaining to the Dhamma or the discipline, he answers and does not falter. This, I say, is his beauty. [399] And he gains robes... and provisions for the sick. This, I say, is his right proportions. In this way a person who is like a wild colt possesses speed, beauty, and the right proportions. These are the three kinds of persons who are like wild colts.

"And what, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of good horses? (4)-(6) Here, one kind of good horse ... [as above for the wild colts] . . possesses speed, beauty, and the right proportions. These are the three kinds of good horses. ${ }^{1887}$

"And what, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons who are like good horses? (4)-(6) Here, one person who is like a good horse...[as above for the persons who are like wild colts] . . possesses speed, beauty, and the right proportions.

(4)-(6) "And how, bhikkhus, does a person who is like a good horse . . . possess speed, beauty, and the right proportions? Here, with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, a bhikkhu is one of spontaneous birth, due to attain final nibbāna there without ever returning from that world. This, I say, is his speed. And when asked a question pertaining to the Dhamma and the discipline, he answers and does not falter. This, I say, is his beauty. And he gains robes . . . and provisions for the sick. This, I say, is his right proportions. In this way a person who is like a good horse possesses speed, beauty, and the right proportions. These are the three kinds of persons that are like good horses.

"And what, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of excellent thoroughbred horses? (7)-(9) Here, one kind of excellent thoroughbred horse . . [as above for the wild colts] . . possesses speed, beauty, and the right proportions. [400] These are the three kinds of excellent thoroughbred horses.

"And what, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of excellent thoroughbred persons? (7)-(9) Here, one kind of excellent thoroughbred person... [as above for the persons who are like wild colts]... possesses speed, beauty, and the right proportions.

(7)-(9) "And how, bhikkhus, does an excellent thoroughbred
person...possess speed, beauty, and the right proportions? Here, with the destruction of the taints, a bhikkhu has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. This, I say, is his speed. And when asked a question pertaining to the Dhamma and the discipline, he answers and does not falter. This, I say, is his beauty. And he gains robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick. This, I say, is his right proportions. In this way an excellent thoroughbred person possesses speed, beauty, and the right proportions. These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of excellent thoroughbred persons."

# 23 (3) Craving

"I will teach you, bhikkhus, nine things rooted in craving. ${ }^{1888}$ Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"And what are the nine things rooted in craving? (1) In dependence on craving there is seeking. (2) In dependence on seeking there is gain. (3) In dependence on gain there is judgment. (4) In dependence on judgment there is desire and lust. (5) In dependence on desire and lust there is attachment. (6) In dependence on attachment there is possessiveness. (7) In dependence on possessiveness there is miserliness. (8) In dependence on miserliness there is safeguarding. (9) With safeguarding as the foundation originate the taking up of rods [401] and weapons, quarrels, contentions, and disputes, accusations, divisive speech, and false speech, and many [other] bad unwholesome things. These are the nine things rooted in craving."1889

## 24 (4) Beings

"Bhikkhus, there are these nine abodes of beings. What nine? ${ }^{1890}$

(1) "There are, bhikkhus, beings that are different in body and different in perception, such as humans, some devas, and some in the lower world. This is the first abode of beings.

(2) "There are beings that are different in body but identical in perception, such as the devas of Brahmā's company that are reborn through the first [jhāna]. This is the second abode of beings.
(3) "There are beings that are identical in body but different in perception, such as the devas of streaming radiance. This is the third abode of beings.

(4) "There are beings that are identical in body and identical in perception, such as the devas of refulgent glory. This is the fourth abode of beings.

(5) "There are beings that are non-percipient, without experience, such as the devas that are non-percipient. This is the fifth abode of beings.

(6) "There are beings that, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, [perceiving] 'space is infinite,' belong to the base of the infinity of space. This is the sixth abode of beings.

(7) "There are beings that, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of space, [perceiving] 'consciousness is infinite,' belong to the base of the infinity of consciousness. This is the seventh abode of beings.

(8) "There are beings that, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of consciousness, [perceiving] 'there is nothing,' belong to the base of nothingness. This is the eighth abode of beings.

(9) "There are beings that, by completely surmounting the base of nothingness, belong to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. This is the ninth abode of beings.

"These are the nine abodes of beings." [402]

# 25 (5) Wisdom

"Bhikkhus, when the mind of a bhikkhu is well consolidated by wisdom, he is able to assert: 'Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.'

"And how is the mind of a bhikkhu well consolidated by wisdom? (1) His mind is well consolidated by wisdom [when he knows]: 'My mind is without lust.' (2) His mind is well consolidated by wisdom [when he knows]: 'My mind is without hatred.' (3) His mind is well consolidated by wisdom [when he knows]: 'My mind is without delusion.' (4) His mind is well consolidated by wisdom [when he knows]: 'My mind is not subject to infatuation.' (5) His mind is well consolidated by wisdom [when he knows]: 'My mind is not subject to animosity.' (6) His
mind is well consolidated by wisdom [when he knows]: 'My mind is not subject to confusion.' (7) His mind is well consolidated by wisdom [when he knows]: 'My mind is not subject to return to sense-sphere existence.' (8) His mind is well consolidated by wisdom [when he knows]: 'My mind is not subject to return to form-sphere existence.' (9) His mind is well consolidated by wisdom [when he knows]: 'My mind is not subject to return to formless-sphere existence.'

"When, bhikkhus, the mind of a bhikkhu is well consolidated by wisdom, he is able to assert: 'Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.'"

# 26 (6) The Stone Pillar

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Venerable Sāriputta and the Venerable Candikāputta were dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. There the Venerable Candikāputta addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend!" those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Candikāputta said this: "Friends, Devadatta teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus thus: 'When, friends, a bhikkhu's mind is consolidated by mind, ${ }^{1891}$ it is fitting for him to declare: [403] "I understand: Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being." "

Then the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Verierable Candikāputta: "Friend Candikāputta, it is not in such a way that Devadatta teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus. Rather, Devadatta teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus thus: 'When, friends, a bhikkhu's mind is well consolidated by mind, ${ }^{1892}$ it is fitting for him to declare: "I understand: Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being." "

A second time... A third time the Venerable Candikāputta addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, Devadatta teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus thus: 'When, friends, a bhikkhu's mind is consolidated by mind, it is fitting for him to declare: "I understand: Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being."'"

A third time the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Venerable Candikāputta: "Friend Candikāputta, it is not in such a way that Devadatta teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus. Rather, Devadatta teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus thus: 'When, friends, a bhikkhu's mind is well consolidated by mind, it is fitting for him to declare: "I understand: Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being."

"And how, friend, is the mind of a bhikkhu well consolidated by mind? [404] (1) His mind is well consolidated by mind [when he knows]: 'My mind is without lust.' (2) His mind is well consolidated by mind [when he knows]: 'My mind is without hatred.' (3) His mind is well consolidated by mind [when he knows]: 'My mind is without delusion.' (4) His mind is well consolidated by mind [when he knows]: 'My mind is not subject to lust.' (5) His mind is well consolidated by mind [when he knows]: 'My mind is not subject to hatred.' (6) His mind is well consolidated by mind [when he knows]: 'My mind is not subject to delusion.' (7) His mind is well consolidated by mind [when he knows]: 'My mind is not subject to return to sense-sphere existence.' (8) His mind is well consolidated by mind [when he knows]: 'My mind is not subject to return to form-sphere existence.' (9) His mind is well consolidated by mind [when he knows]: 'My mind is not subject to return to formless-sphere existence. ${ }^{1893}$

"When, friend, a bhikkhu is thus perfectly liberated in mind, even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into range of the eye, they do not obsess his mind; his mind is not at all affected. ${ }^{1894}$ It remains steady, attained to imperturbability, and he observes its vanishing. Even if powerful sounds cognizable by the ear come into range of the ear . . Even if powerful odors cognizable by the nose come into range of the nose... Even if powerful tastes cognizable by the tongue come into range of the tongue... Even if powerful tactile objects cognizable by the body come into range of the body ... Even if powerful phenomena cognizable by the mind come into range of the mind, they do not obsess his mind; his mind is not at all affected. It remains steady, attained to imperturbability, and he observes its vanishing.

"Suppose, friend, there was a stone pillar eight meters
long. ${ }^{1895}$ Four meters would be below ground and four meters above ground. If a violent rainstorm should then arrive from the east, it would not shake it or make it quake, [405] wobble, and tremble; ${ }^{1896}$ if a violent rainstorm should then arrive from the west . . . from the north . . . from the south, it would not shake it or make it quake, wobble, and tremble. For what reason? Because the stone pillar is deep in the ground and is securely planted. So too, friend, when a bhikkhu is thus perfectly liberated in mind, even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into range of the eye ... Even if powerful phenomena cognizable by the mind come into range of the mind, they do not obsess his mind; his mind is not at all affected. It remains steady, attained to imperturbability, and he observes its vanishing."

# 27 (7) Enmity (1)

Then the householder Anathapindika approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Householder, when a noble disciple has eliminated five perils and enmities and possesses the four factors of streamentry, he might, if he so wished, declare of himself: 'I am one finished with hell, the animal realm, and the sphere of afflicted spirits; finished with the plane of misery, the bad destination, the lower world; I am a stream-enterer, no longer subject to [rebirth in] the lower world, fixed in destiny, heading for enlightenment. ${ }^{1897}$ [406]

"What are the five perils and enmities that have been eliminated? (1) Householder, one who destroys life, with the destruction of life as condition, creates peril and enmity pertaining to the present life and peril and enmity pertaining to future lives ${ }^{1898}$ and he also experiences mental pain and dejection. One who abstains from the destruction of life does not create such peril and enmity pertaining to the present life or such peril and enmity pertaining to future lives nor does he experience mental pain and dejection. For one who abstains from the destruction of life, that peril and enmity has thus been eliminated.

(2) "One who takes what is not given... (3) who engages in sexual misconduct... (4) who speaks falsely... (5) who indulges in liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, with indulgence in liquor, wine, and intoxicants as condition, creates peril and enmity pertaining to the present life and peril
and enmity pertaining to future lives and he also experiences mental pain and dejection. One who abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, does not create such peril and enmity pertaining to the present life or such peril and enmity pertaining to future lives nor does he experience mental pain and dejection. For one who abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, that peril and enmity has thus been eliminated.

"These are the five perils and enmities that have been eliminated.

"And what are the four factors of stream-entry that he possesses? (6) Here, householder, a noble disciple possesses unwavering confidence in the Buddha thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' (7) He possesses unwavering confidence in the Dhamma thus: 'The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.' (8) He possesses unwavering confidence in the Sangha thus: 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is practicing the good way, practicing the straight way, [407] practicing the true way, practicing the proper way; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals-this Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.' (9) He possesses the virtuous behavior loved by the noble ones, unbroken, flawless, unblemished, unblotched, freeing, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading to concentration. These are the four factors of stream-entry that he possesses.

"Householder, when a noble disciple has eliminated these five perils and enmities and possesses these four factors of stream-entry, he might, if he so wished, declare of himself: 'I am one finished with hell, the animal realm, and the sphere of afflicted spirits; finished with the plane of misery, the bad destination, the lower world; I am a stream-enterer, no longer subject to [rebirth in] the lower world, fixed in destiny, heading for enlightenment.'"

28 (8) Enmity (2)

[Identical with 9:27, but addressed by the Buddha to the bhikkhus.] [408]

29 (9) Resentment (1)

"Bhikkhus, there are these nine grounds for resentment. What nine? (1) [Thinking:] 'He acted for my harm,' one harbors resentment. (2) [Thinking:] 'He is acting for my harm,' one har-. bors resentment. (3) [Thinking:] 'He will act for my harm,' one harbors resentment. (4) [Thinking:] 'He acted for the harm of one pleasing and agreeable to me,' one harbors resentment. (5) [Thinking:] 'He is acting for the harm of one pleasing and agreeable to me,' one harbors resentment. (6) [Thinking:] 'He will act for the harm of one pleasing and agreeable to me,' one harbors resentment. (7) [Thinking:] 'He acted for the benefit of one displeasing and disagreeable to me,' one harbors resentment. (8) [Thinking:] 'He is acting for the benefit of one displeasing and disagreeable to me,' one harbors resentment. (9) [Thinking:] 'He will act for the benefit of one displeasing and disagreeable to me,' one harbors resentment. These, bhikkhus, are the nine grounds for resentment."

30 (10) Resentment (2)

"Bhikkhus, there are these nine ways of removing resentment. What nine? (1) [Thinking:] 'He acted for my harm, but what can be done about it? ${ }^{1899}$ one removes resentment. (2) [Thinking:] 'He is acting for my harm, but what can be done about it?' one removes resentment. (3) [Thinking:] 'He will act for my harm, but what can be done about it?' one removes resentment. (4) [Thinking:] 'He acted for the harm of one who is pleasing and agreeable to me, but what can be done about it?' one removes resentment. (5) [Thinking:] 'He is acting for the harm of one who is pleasing and agreeable to me, but what can be done about it?' one removes resentment. [409] (6) [Thinking:] 'He will act for the harm of one who is pleasing and agreeable to me, but what can be done about it?' one removes resentment (7) [Thinking:] 'He acted for the benefit of one who is displeasing and disagreeable to me, but what can be done about it?' one removes resentment. (8) [Thinking:] 'He is acting for the benefit of one who is displeasing and disagreeable to me, but what
can be done about it?' one removes resentment. (9) [Thinking:] 'He will act for the benefit of one who is displeasing and disagreeable to me, but what can be done about it?' one removes resentment. These, bhikkhus, are the nine ways of removing resentment."

# 31 (11) Progressive Cessation

"Bhikkhus, there are these nine progressive cessations. ${ }^{1900}$ What nine? (1) For one who has attained the first jhāna, sensual perception has ceased. (2) For one who has attained the second jhāna, thought and examination have ceased. (3) For one who has attained the third jhāna, rapture has ceased. (4) For one who has attained the fourth jhāna, in-breathing and out-breathing have ceased. (5) For one who has attained the base of the infinity of space, the perception of form has ceased. ${ }^{1901}$ (6) For one who has attained the base of the infinity of consciousness, the perception pertaining to the base of the infinity of space has ceased. (7) For one who has attained the base of nothingness, the perception pertaining to the base of the infinity of consciousness has ceased. (8) For one who has attained the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, the perception pertaining to the base of nothingness has ceased. (9) For one who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling have ceased. These, bhikkhus, are the nine progressive cessations." [410]

## IV. The Great Chapter

## 32 (1) Dwellings (1)

"Bhikkhus, there are these nine progressive dwellings. ${ }^{1902}$ What nine? (1) Here, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. (2) With the subsiding of thought and examination, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration, without thought and examination. (3) With the fading away as well of rapture, he dwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, he experiences pleasure with the
body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: 'He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.' (4) With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity.

(5) "With the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, [perceiving] 'space is infinite,' a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of space. (6) By completely surmounting the base of the infinity of space, [perceiving] 'consciousness is infinite,' he enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of consciousness. (7) By completely surmounting the base of the infinity of consciousness, [perceiving] 'there is nothing,' he enters and dwells in the base of nothingness. (8) By completely surmounting the base of nothingness, he enters and dwells in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.

"This, bhikkhus, is the attainment of the nine progressive dwellings."

# 34 (3) Nibbāna

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Venerable Sāriputta was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend!" those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:

"Happiness, friends, is this nibbāna. Happiness, friends, is this nibbāna."

When this was said, the Venerable Udāy ${ }^{1908}$ said to the Venerable Sāriputta: [415] "But, friend Sāriputta, what happiness could there be here when nothing is felt here?"

"Just this, friend, is the happiness here, that nothing is felt here.

"There are, friends, these five objects of sensual pleasure. What five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensual pleasure, tantalizing; sounds cognizable by the ear...odors cognizable by the nose ... tastes cognizable by the tongue ... tactile objects cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensual pleasure, tantalizing. These
are the five objects of sensual pleasure. Any pleasure or joy that arises in dependence on these five objects of sensual pleasure is called sensual pleasure.

(1) "Here, friends, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. If, while that bhikkhu is dwelling in this way, perception and attention accompanied by sensuality occur in him, he feels it as an affliction. Just as pain might arise for one feeling pleasure only to afflict him, so too if that perception and attention accompanied by sensuality occur in him, he feels it as an affliction. But the Blessed One has called affliction suffering. In this way it can be understood how nibbāna is happiness. ${ }^{1909}$

(2) "Again, with the subsiding of thought and examination, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna.... If, while that bhikkhu is dwelling in this way, perception and attention accompanied by thought [416] occur in him, he feels it as an affliction. Just as pain might arise for one feeling pleasure only to afflict him, so too if that perception and attention accompanied by thought occur in him, he feels it as an affliction. But the Blessed One has called affliction suffering. In this way, too, it can be understood how nibbāna is happiness.

(3) "Again, with the fading away as well of rapture... he enters and dwells in the third jhāna.... If, while that bhikkhu is dwelling in this way, perception and attention accompanied by rapture occur in him, he feels it as an affliction.... In this way, too, it can be understood how nibbāna is happiness.

(4) "Again, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain... a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna.... If, while that bhikkhu is dwelling in this way, perception and attention accompanied by the pleasure [connected with] equanimity ${ }^{1910}$ occur in him, he feels it as an affliction.... In this way, too, it can be understood how nibbāna is happiness.

(5) "Again, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, [perceiving] 'space is infinite,' a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of space. If, while that bhikkhu is dwelling in this way, perception and attention accompanied by forms
occur in him, he feels it as an affliction. . . [417]... In this way, too, it can be understood how nibbāna is happiness.

(6) "Again, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of space, [perceiving] 'consciousness is infinite,' a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of consciousness. If, while that bhikkhu is dwelling in this way, perception and attention accompanied by the base of the infinity of space occur in him, he feels it as an affliction. . . In this way, too, it can be understood how nibbāna is happiness.

(7) "Again, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of consciousness, [perceiving] 'there is nothing,' a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of nothingness. If, while that bhikkhu is dwelling in this way, perception and attention accompanied by the base of the infinity of consciousness occur in him, he feels it as an affliction. . . In this way, too, it can be understood how nibbāna is happiness.

(8) "Again, by completely surmounting the base of nothingness, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. If, while that bhikkhu is dwelling in this way, perception and attention accompanied by the base of nothingness occur in him, he feels it as an affliction. Just as pain might arise for one feeling pleasure only to afflict him, so too if that perception and attention accompanied by the base of nothingness occur in him, he feels it as an affliction. But the Blessed One has called affliction suffering. In this way, too, it can be understood how nibbāna is happiness. [418]

(9) "Again, by completely surmounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the cessation of perception and feeling, and having seen with wisdom, his taints are utterly destroyed. In this way, too, it can be understood how nibbāna is happiness."

# 35 (4) The Cow

"Suppose, bhikkhus, there were a mountain-dwelling cow that was foolish, incompetent, inexperienced, and unskilled in walking on rough mountains. ${ }^{1911}$ It might occur to her: 'I should go to a region where I have never gone before, eat grass that I have never eaten before, drink water that I have never drunk before.' She would set down a front foot, and while it is not yet firmly planted, lift up a hind foot. She would not go to a region where
she had never gone before, eat grass that she had never eaten before, drink water that she had never drunk before; and she would not return safely to the region where she was staying when it occurred to her: 'I should go to a region where I have never gone before, eat grass that I have never eaten before, drink water that I have never drunk before.' For what reason? Because that mountain-dwelling cow was foolish, incompetent, inexperienced, and unskilled in walking on rough mountains.

"So too, some bhikkhu here is foolish, incompetent, inexperienced, and unskilled, when, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. He does not pursue that object, ${ }^{1912}$ does not develop and cultivate it, does not focus on it well.

"It occurs to him: 'With the subsiding of thought and examination, I should enter and dwell in the second jhāna [419].... But he cannot enter and dwell in the second jhāna.... Then it occurs to him: 'Secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, I should enter and dwell in the first jhāna....' But he cannot enter and dwell in the first jhāna.... This is called a bhikkhui who has dropped away from both, ${ }^{1913}$ fallen away from both. He is just like that mountain-dwelling cow that was foolish, incompetent, inexperienced, and unskilled in walking on rough mountains.

"Suppose, bhikkhus, there were a mountain-dwelling cow that was wise, competent, experienced, and skilled in walking on rough mountains. It might occur to her: 'I should go to a region where I have never gone before, eat grass that I have never eaten before, drink water that I have never drunk before.' When setting down a front foot, she would firmly plant it, and only then lift up a hind foot. She would go to a region where she had never gone before, eat grass that she had never eaten before, drink water that she had never drunk before; and she would return safely to the region where she was staying when it occurred to her: 'I should go to a region where I have never gone before, eat grass that I have never eaten before, drink water that I have never drunk before.' For what reason? Because that mountain-dwelling cow was wise, competent, experienced, and skilled in walking on rough mountains.
(1) "So too, some bhikkhu here is wise, competent, experienced, and skilled when, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna.... He pursues that object, develops and cultivates it, and focuses on it well.

(2) "It occurs to him: 'With the subsiding of thought and examination, I should enter and dwell in the second jhāna....' Not injuring ${ }^{1914}$ the second jhāna, with the subsiding of thought and examination he enters and dwells in the second jhāna.... He pursues that object, develops and cultivates it, and focuses on it well.

(3) "Then it occurs to him: 'With the fading away as well of rapture [420] . . I should enter and dwell in the third jhāna....' Not injuring the third jhāna, with the fading away as well of rapture he enters and dwells in the third jhāna.... He pursues that object, develops and cultivates it, and focuses on it well.

(4) "Then it occurs to him: 'With the abandoning of pleasure and pain...I should enter and dwell in the fourth jhāna....' Not injuring the fourth jhāna, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain... he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna.... He pursues that object, develops and cultivates it, and focuses on it well.

(5) "Then it occurs to him: 'With the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, [perceiving] "space is infinite," I should enter and dwell in the base of the infinity of space.' Not injuring the base of the infinity of space, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms... he enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of space. He pursues that object, develops and cultivates it, and focuses on it well.

(6) "Then it occurs to him; 'With the complete surmounting of the base of the infinity of space, [perceiving] "consciousness is infinite," I should enter and dwell in the base of the infinity of consciousness.' Not injuring the base of the infinity of consciousness, with the complete surmounting of the base of the infinity of space ... he enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of consciousness. He pursues that object, develops and cultivates it, and focuses on it well.

(7) "Then it occurs to him: 'With the complete surmounting
of the base of the infinity of consciousness, [perceiving] "there is nothing," I should enter and dwell in the base of nothingness.' Not injuring the base of nothingness, with the complete surmounting of the base of the infinity of consciousness... he enters and dwells in the base of nothingness. He pursues that object, develops and cultivates it, and focuses on it well.

(8) "Then it occurs to him: 'With the complete surmounting of the base of nothingness, I should enter and dwell in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.' Not injuring the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, with the complete surmounting of the base of nothingness, he enters and dwells in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. He pursues that object, develops and cultivates it, [421] and focuses on it well.

(9) "Then it occurs to him: 'With the complete surmounting of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, I should enter and dwell in the cessation of perception and feeling.' Not injuring the cessation of perception and feeling, with the complete surmounting of the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception, he enters and dwells in the cessation of perception and feeling.

"When, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu enters and emerges from each of these meditative attainments, his mind becomes malleable and wieldy. With the mind malleable and wieldy, his concentration becomes measureless and well developed. With measureless, well-developed concentration, whatever state realizable by direct knowledge he inclines his mind toward to realize by direct knowledge, he is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.

"If he wishes: 'May I wield the various kinds of psychic potency: having been one, may I become many ... [here and below in full as at 6:2]... may I exercise mastery with the body as far as the brahmā world,' he is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.

"If he wishes: 'May I, with the divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the human, hear both kinds of sounds, the divine and human, those that are far as well as near,' he is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.

"If he wishes: 'May I understand the minds of other beings and persons, having encompassed them with my own mind.

May I understand . . . an unliberated mind as unliberated,' he is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.

"If he wishes:'May I recollect my manifold past abodes . . . with their aspects and details,' he is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis. [422]

"If he wishes: 'May I, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, see beings passing away and being reborn... and understand how beings fare in accordance with their kamma,' he is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.

"If he wishes: 'May I, with the destruction of the taints, in this very life enter and dwell in the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, having realized it for myself with direct knowledge,' he is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis."

# 36 (5) Jhāna

(1) "Bhikkhus, I say that the destruction of the taints occurs in dependence on the first jhāna. (2) I say that the destruction of the taints also occurs in dependence on the second jhāna.

mind away from those phenomena and directs it to the deathless element thus: 'This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, the stilling of all activities, the relinquishing of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, nibbāna. ${ }^{1916}$ If he is firm in this, he attains the destruction of the taints. But if he does not attain the destruction of the taints because of that lust for the Dhamma, because of that delight in the Dhamma, ${ }^{1917}$ then, with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, he becomes one of spontaneous birth, due to attain final nibbāna there without ever returning from that world.

"Just as an archer or an archer's apprentice undergoes training on a straw man or a heap of clay, and then at a later time becomes a long-distance shooter, a sharp-shooter, one who splits a great body, ${ }^{1918}$ so too, secluded from sensual pleasures . . . a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna.

# 37 (6) Ānanda

On one occasion the Venerable Ānanda was dwelling at Kosambi in Ghosita's Park. There the Venerable Ānanda addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend!" those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Ānanda said this:

"It's astounding and amazing, friends, that the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, who knows and sees, has discovered the achievement of an opening in the midst of confinement: ${ }^{1922}$ for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and dejection, for the achievement of the method, for the realization of nibbāna. ${ }^{1923}$ (1) The eye itself as well as those forms will actually be present, [427] and yet one will not experience that base. ${ }^{1924}$ (2) The ear itself as well as those sounds will actually be present, and yet one will not experience that base. (3) The nose itself as well as those odors will actually be present, and yet one will not experience that base. (4) The tongue itself as well as those tastes will actually be present, and yet one will not experience that base. (5) The body itself as well as those tactile objects will actually be present, and yet one will not experience that base."

When this was said, the Venerable Udāyī said this to the Venerable Ānanda: "Is it, friend Ānanda, while one is actually percipient or while one is non-percipient that one does not experience that base?"
"It is, friend, while one is actually percipient that one does not experience that base, not while one is non-percipient."

"But, friend, of what is one percipient when one does not experience that base?"

(6) "Here, friend, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, [perceiving] 'space is infinite,' a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of space. When one is thus percipient one does not experience that base.

(7) "Again, friend, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of space, [perceiving] 'consciousness is infinite,' a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of consciousness. When one is thus percipient one does not experience that base.

(8) "Again, friend, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of consciousness, [perceiving] 'there is nothing,' a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of nothingness. When one is thus percipient one does not experience that base. ${ }^{1925}$

"Once, friend, I was dwelling at Sāketa in the deer park at Añjana Grove. Then the bhikkhunī Jaṭilagāhiyā ${ }^{1926}$ [428] approached me, paid homage to me, stood to one side, and said: 'Bhante Ānanda, the concentration that does not lean forward and does not bend back, ${ }^{1927}$ and that is not reined in and checked by forcefully suppressing [the defilements] ${ }^{1928}$-by being liberated, it is steady; by being steady, it is content; by being content, one is not agitated. ${ }^{1929}$ Bhante Ānanda, what did the Blessed One say this concentration has as its fruit? ${ }^{1930}$

(9) "When she asked me this, I replied: 'Sister, the concentration that does not lean forward and does not bend back, and that is not reined in and checked by forcefully suppressing [the defilements]-by being liberated, it is steady; by being steady, it is content; by being content, one is not agitated. The Blessed One said this concentration has final knowledge as its fruit. ${ }^{1931}$ When one is thus percipient too, friend, one does not experience that base."

# 38 (7) The Brahmins

Then two brahmin cosmologists ${ }^{1932}$ approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded
their greetings and cordial talk, they sat down to one side and said to him:

"Master Gotama, Pūraṇa Kassapa claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing and to have all-embracing knowledge and vision: 'Whether I am walking, standing, sleeping, or awake, knowledge and vision are constantly and continuously present to me.' He says thus: 'With infinite knowledge, I dwell knowing and seeing the world to be infinite.' [429] But Niganṭha Nātaputta also claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing and to have all-embracing knowledge and vision: 'Whether I am walking, standing, sleeping, and awake, knowledge and vision are constantly and continuously present to me.' He says thus: 'With infinite knowledge, I dwell knowing and seeing the world to be finite. ${ }^{1933}$ When these two claimants to knowledge make claims that are mutually contradictory, who speaks truthfully and who falsely?"

"Enough, brahmins, let this be: 'When these two claimants to knowledge make claims that are mutually contradictory, who speaks truthfully and who falsely?' I will teach you the Dhamma. Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, sir," those brahmins replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Suppose, brahmins, there were four men standing in the four quarters possessing supreme movement ${ }^{1934}$ and speed and a supreme stride. Their speed was like that of a light arrow easily shot by a firm-bowed archer-one trained, skillful, and experienced ${ }^{1935}$-across the shadow of a palmyra tree. Their stride was such that it could reach from the eastern ocean to the western ocean. Then the person standing in the eastern quarter would say thus: 'I will reach the end of the world by traveling.' Having a life span of a hundred years, living for a huridred years, he might travel for a hundred years without pausing except to eat, drink, chew, and taste, to defecate and urinate, and to dispel fatigue with sleep; yet he would die along the way without having reached the end of the world. ${ }^{1936}$ [430] Then the person standing in the western quarter would say thus:.. the person standing in the northern quarter would say thus... the person standing in the southern quarter would say thus: 'I will reach the end of the world by traveling.' Having a life span of a hundred years, living for a hundred years, he might travel for
a hundred years without pausing except to eat, drink, chew, and taste, to defecate and urinate, and to dispel fatigue with sleep; yet he would die along the way without having reached the end of the world. For what reason? I say, brahmins, that by this kind of running ${ }^{1937}$ one cannot know, see, or reach the end of the world. And yet I say that without having reached the end of the world there is no making an end of suffering.

"These five objects of sensual pleasure, brahmins, are called 'the world' in the Noble One's discipline. What five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensual pleasure, tantalizing; sounds cognizable by the ear . . . odors cognizable by the nose . . . tastes cognizable by the tongue ... tactile objects cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensual pleasure, tantalizing. These five objects of sensual pleasure are called 'the world' in the Noble One's discipline.

(1) "Here, brahmins, secluded from sensual pleasures... a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna. . . This is called a bhikkhu who, having come to the end of the world, dwells at the end of the world. Others say thus of him: 'He, too, is included in the world; he, too, is not yet released from the world.' I also say thus: 'He, too, is included in the world; he, too, is not yet released from the world.' [431]

(2)-(4) "Again, with the subsiding of thought and examination, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna... the third jhāna . . . the fourth jhāna. . . . This is called a bhikkhu who, having come to the end of the world, dwells at the end of the world. Others say thus of him: 'He, too, is included in the world; he, too, is not yet released from the world.' I also say thus: 'He, too, is included in the world; he, too, is not yet released from the world.'

(5) "Again, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, [perceiving] 'space is infinite,' a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of space. This is called a bhikkhu who, having come to the end of the world, dwells at the end of the world. Others say thus of him: 'He, too, is included in the world; he, too, is not yet released from the world.' I also say thus: 'He,
too, is included in the world; he, too, is not yet released from the world.'

(6)-(8) "Again, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of space, [perceiving] 'consciousness is infinite,' a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of consciousness.... By completely surmounting the base of the infinity of consciousness, [perceiving] 'there is nothing,' a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of nothingness.... By completely surmounting the base of nothingness, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. This is called a bhikkhu who, having come to the end of the world, dwells at the end of the world. Others say thus of him: 'He, too, is included in the world; he, too, is not yet released from the world.' I also say thus: 'He, too, is included in the world; he, too, is not yet released from the world.'

(9) "Again, by completely surmounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the cessation of perception and feeling, and having seen with wisdom, his taints are utterly destroyed. This is called a bhikkhu [432] who, having come to the end of the world, dwells at the end of the world, one who has crossed over attachment to the world."

# 39 (8) The Devas

"Bhikkhus, in the past a battle was fought between the devas and the asuras. In that battle, the asuras were victorious and the devas were defeated. Defeated, the devas fled north, pursued by the asuras. Then it occurred to the devas: 'The asuras are still pursuing us. Let's engage them in battle a second time.' A second time the devas fought a battle with the asuras, and a second time the asuras were victorious and the devas were defeated. Defeated, the devas ${ }^{1938}$ fled north, pursued by the asuras. Then it occurred to the devas: 'The asuras are still pursuing us. Let's engage them in battle a third time.' A third time the devas fought a battle with the asuras, and a third time the asuras were victorious and the devas were defeated. Defeated and frightened, the devas entered their city.

"After the devas had entered their city, it occurred to them: 'Now we're [433] secure from danger and the asuras cannot do anything to us.' It also occurred to the asuras: 'Now the
devas are secure from danger and we cannot do anything to them.'

"In the past, bhikkhus, a battle was fought between the devas and the asuras. In that battle, the devas were victorious and the asuras were defeated. Defeated, the asuras fled south, pursued by the devas. Then it occurred to the asuras: 'The devas are still pursuing us. Let's engage them in battle a second time.' A second time the asuras fought a battle with the devas, and a second time the devas were victorious and the asuras were defeated. Defeated, the asuras fled south, pursued by the devas. Then it occurred to the asuras: 'The devas are still pursuing us. Let's engage them in battle a third time.' A third time the asuras fought a battle with the devas, and a third time the devas were victorious and the asuras were defeated. Defeated and frightened, the asuras entered their city.

"After the asuras had entered their city, it occurred to them: 'Now we're secure from danger and the devas cannot do anything to us.' It also occurred to the devas: 'Now the asuras are secure from danger and we cannot do anything to them.'

(1) "So too, bhikkhus, when, secluded from sensual pleasures . . . a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna . . . on that occasion it occurs to the bhikkhu: 'Now I am secure from danger [434] and Māra cannot do anything to me.' It also occurs to Māra the Evil One: 'Now the bhikkhu is secure against danger and I cannot do anything to him.'

(2)-(4) "When, with the subsiding of thought and examination, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna... the third jhāna... the fourth jhāna... on that occasion it occurs to the bhikkhu: 'Now I am secure from danger and Māra cannot do anything to me.' It also occurs to Māra the Evil One: 'Now the bhikkhu is secure from danger and I cannot do anything to him.'

(5) "When, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, [perceiving] 'space is infinite,' a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of space, on that occasion he is called a bhikkhu who has blinded Māra, ${ }^{1939}$ put out Māra's eyes without a trace, ${ }^{1940}$ and gone beyond sight of the Evil One.

(6)-(9) "When, bhikkhus, by completely surmounting the
base of the infinity of space, [perceiving] 'consciousness is infinite,' a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of consciousness. . . . When, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of consciousness, [perceiving] 'there is nothing,' a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of nothingness. . . . When, by completely surmounting the base of nothingness, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception. . . . When, by completely surmounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the cessation of perception and feeling, and having seen with wisdom, his taints are utterly destroyed, on that occasion he is called a bhikkhu who has blinded Māra, put out Māra's eyes, gone beyond sight of the Evil One, and crossed over attachment to the world." [435]

# 40 (9) A Bull Elephant

"Bhikkhus, when a forest-dwelling bull elephant is heading for its feeding ground, and other elephants-males, females, young ones, ${ }^{1941}$ and babies-precede him and break the tops of the grass, the bull elephant is repelled, humiliated, and disgusted with this. When a forest-dwelling bull elephant is heading for its feeding ground, and other elephants-males, females, young ones, and babies-eat the bent and twisted bundle of branches, the bull elephant is repelled, humiliated, and disgusted with this. When a forest-dwelling bull elephant has entered the pool and other elephants-males, females, young ones, and babies-precede him and stir up the water with their trunks, the bull elephant is repelled, humiliated, and disgusted with this. When a forestdwelling bull elephant has emerged from the pool and female elephants go by brushing against his body, the forest-dwelling bull elephant is repelled, humiliated, and disgusted with this.

"On that occasion it occurs to the forest-dwelling bull elephant: 'I am presently dwelling hemmed in by other elephants: males, females, young ones, and babies. I eat grass with the tops broken off, and they eat my bent and twisted bundle of branches. I drink muddy water, and when I have come out from the pool, the female elephants go by brushing against my body. Let me dwell alone, withdrawn from the herd.'

"Some time later he dwells alone, withdrawn from the herd. He then eats grass without the tops broken off; they do not eat
his bent and twisted [436] bundle of branches; he drinks clear water; and when he has come out from the pool, the female elephants do not go by brushing against his body. On that occasion it occurs to the forest-dwelling bull elephant: 'In the past I dwelled hemmed in by other elephants . . . and when I came out from the pool, the female elephants went by brushing against my body. But now I dwell alone, withdrawn from the herd. I eat grass without the tops broken off; they do not eat my bent and twisted bundle of branches; I drink clear water; and when I have come out from the pool, the female elephants do not go by brushing against my body.' Having broken off a bundle of branches with his trunk, having rubbed his body with it, he happily relieves his itches.

"So too, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu dwells hemmed in by bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, male and female lay followers, kings and royal ministers, sectarian teachers and the disciples of sectarian teachers, on that occasion it occurs to him: 'I am presently dwelling hemmed in by bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, male and female lay followers, kings and royal ministers, sectarian teachers and the disciples of sectarian teachers. Let me dwell alone, withdrawn from company.'

"He resorts to a secluded lodging: the forest, [437] the foot of a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a jungle thicket, an open space, a heap of straw. Gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, he sits down, folding his legs crosswise, straightening his body, and establishing mindfulness before him. Having abandoned longing for the world, he dwells with a mind free from longing; he purifies his mind from longing. Having abandoned ill will and hatred, he dwells with a mind free from ill will, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings; he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred. Having abandoned dullness and drowsiness, he dwells free from dullness and drowsiness, percipient of light, mindful and clearly comprehending; he purifies his mind from dullness and drowsiness. Having abandoned restlessness and remorse, he dwells without agitation, with a mind inwardly peaceful; he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorse. Having abandoned doubt, he dwells having gone beyond doubt, unperplexed about wholesome qualities; he purifies his mind from doubt.
(1) "Having thus abandoned these five hindrances, defilemerits of the mind, things that weaken wisdom, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna. . . . Elated, he relieves his itches.

(2)-(4) "With the subsiding of thought and examination, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna... the third jhāna... the fourth jhāna. . . . Elated, he relieves his itches.

(5) "With the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity; [perceiving] 'space is infinite,' a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of space. Elated, he relieves his itches.

(6)-(9) "By completely surmounting the base of the infinity of space, [perceiving] 'consciousness is infinite,' a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of consciousness. . . . By completely surmounting the base of the infinity of consciousness, [perceiving] 'there is nothing,' a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of nothingness. . . . By completely surmounting the base of nothingness, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. . . . By completely surmounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, [438] a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the cessation of perception and feeling, and having seen with wisdom, his taints are utterly destroyed. Elated, he relieves his itches."

# 41 (10) Tapussa

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Mallas near the Mallan town named Uruvelakappa. ${ }^{1942}$ Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Uruvelakappa for alms. When he had walked for alms in Uruvelakappa, after his meal, on returning from his alms round, he addressed the Venerable Ānanda: "You stay right here, Ānanda, while I enter the Great Wood to pass the day."

"Yes, Bhante," the Venerable Ānanda replied. Then the Blessed One entered the Great Wood and sat down to pass the day at the foot of a tree.

Then the householder Tapussa approached the Venerable Ānanda, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:
"Bhante Ānanda, we laymen enjoy sensual pleasures, delight in sensual pleasures, take delight in sensual pleasures, and rejoice in sensual pleasures. Renunciation seems like a precipice to us. I have heard that in this Dhamma and discipline there are very young bhikkhus, whose minds launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, ${ }^{1943}$ seeing ${ }^{1944}$ it as peaceful. Renunciation, Bhante, is the dividing line between the multitude and the bhikkhus in this Dhamma and discipline. ${ }^{1945}$ [439]

"This, householder, is a subject that we should see the Blessed One about. Come, let's go to the Blessed One and report this matter to him. We should retain the Blessed One's explanation in mind."

"Yes, Bhante," the householder Tapussa replied.

Then the Venerable Ānanda, together with the householder Tapussa, went to the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: "Bhante, this householder Tapussa says: 'Bhante Ānanda, we laymen enjoy sensual pleasures... [and] renunciation seems like a precipice to us. . . [But] there are very young bhikkhus whose minds ... [are] liberated in it, seeing it as peaceful. Renunciation, Bhante, is the dividing line between the multitude and the bhikkhus in this Dhamma and discipline.'"

"So it is, Ānanda! So it is, Ānanda! ${ }^{1946}$

(1) "Before my enlightenment, while I was just a bodhisatta, not yet fully enlightened, it occurred to me too: 'Good is renunciation, good is solitude.' Yet my mind did not launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I saw it as peaceful. It occurred to me: 'Why is it that my mind does not launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?' Then it occurred to me: 'I have not seen the danger in sensual pleasures and have not cultivated that [insight]; I have not achieved the benefit in renunciation and have not [440] pursued it. Therefore my mind does not launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful.'

"Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: 'If, having seen the danger in sensual pleasures, I would cultivate that [insight], and if, having achieved the benefit in renunciation, I would pursue it, it is then possible that my mind would launch out upon renuncia-
tion and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I see it as peaceful.' Sometime later, having seen the danger in sensual pleasures, I cultivated that [insight], and having achieved the benefit in renunciation, I pursued it: My mind then launched out upon renunciation and became placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I saw it as peaceful:

"Sometime later, Ānanda, secluded from sensual pleasures... I entered and dwelled in the first jhāna. While I was dwelling in this state, perception and attention accompanied by sensuality occurred in me and I felt it as an affliction. Just as pain might arise for one feeling pleasure only to afflict him, so too, when perception and attention accompanied by sensuality, occurred in me, I felt it as an affliction.

(2) "Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: 'With the subsiding of thought and examination, let me enter and dwell in the second jhāna.'...' Yet my mind did not launch out upon the absence of thought and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I saw it as peaceful. It occurred to me: 'Why is it that my mind does not launch out upon the absence of thought and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?' Then it occurred to me: 'I have not seen the danger in thoughts and have not cultivated that [insight]; I have not achieved the benefit in the absence of thought [441] and have not pursued it. Therefore my mind does not launch out upon the absence of thought and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful.'

"Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: 'If, having seen the danger in thoughts, I would cultivate that [insight], and if, having achieved the benefit in the absence of thought, I would pursue it, it is then possible that my mind would launch out upon the absence of thought and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I see it as peaceful.' Then, sometime later, having seen the danger in thoughts, I cultivated that [insight], and having achieved the benefit in the absence of thought, I pursued it. My mind then launched out upon the absence of thought and became placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I saw it as peaceful.

"Sometime later, ${ }^{1947}$ Ānanda, with the subsiding of thought and examination...I entered and dwelled in the second jhāna.... While I was dwelling in this state, perception and attention
accompanied by thought occurred in me and I felt it as an affliction. Just as pain might arise for one feeling pleasure only to afflict him, so too when that perception and attention accompanied by thought occurred in me, I felt it as an affliction.

(3) "Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: 'With the fading away as well of rapture . . . let me enter and dwell in the third jhāna. . .

It occurred to me: 'Why is it that my mind does not launch out upon the absence of rapture and become placid, settled, [442] and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?' Then it occurred to me: 'I have not seen the danger in rapture and have not cultivated that [insight]; I have not achieved the benefit in the absence of rapture and have not pursued it.

(4) "Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: 'With the abandoning of pleasure and pain...let me enter and dwell in the fourth jhāna....' Yet my mind did not launch out upon the absence of pleasure and pain and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I saw it as peaceful. It occurred to me: 'Why is it that
my mind does not launch out upon the absence of pleasure and pain and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?' Then it occurred to me: 'I have not seen the danger in the pleasure [connected with] equanimity and have not cultivated that [insight]; I have not achieved the benefit in the absence of pleasure and pain and have not pursued it. Therefore my mind does not launch out upon the absence of pleasure and pain and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful.'

"Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: 'If, having seen the danger in the pleasure [connected with] equanimity, [443] I would cultivate that [insight], and if, having achieved the benefit in the absence of pleasure and pain, I would pursue it, it is then possible that my mind would launch out upon the absence of pleasure and pain and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I see it as peaceful.'

Yet my mind did not launch out upon the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I saw it as peaceful. It occurred to me: 'Why is it that my mind does not launch out upon the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?' Then it occurred to me: 'I have not seen the danger in the base of nothingness and have not cultivated that [insight]; I have not achieved the benefit in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception and have not pursued it. Therefore my mind does not launch out upon the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful.'

"Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: 'If, having seen the danger in the base of nothingness, I would cultivate that [insight], and if, having achieved the benefit in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, I would pursue it, it is then possible that my mind would launch out upon the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I see it as peaceful.' [447] Then, sometime later, having seen the danger in the base of nothingness, I cultivated that [insight], and having achieved the benefit in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, I pursued it. My mind
then launched out upon the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception and became placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I saw it as peaceful.

"Sometime-later, Ānanda, by completely surmounting the base of nothingness, I entered and dwelled in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. While I was dwelling in this state, perception and attention accompanied by the base of nothingness occurred in me and I felt it as an affliction. Just as pain might arise for one feeling pleasure only to afflict him, so too, when that perception and attention accompanied by the base of nothingness occurred in me, I felt it as an affliction.

(9) "Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: 'By completely surmounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, let me enter and dwell in the cessation of perception and feeling.' Yet my mind did not launch out upon the cessation of perception and feeling and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I saw it as peaceful. It occurred to me: 'Why is it that my mind does not launch out upon the cessation of perception and feeling and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?' Then it occurred to me: 'I have not seen the danger in the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception and have not cultivated that [insight]; I have not achieved the benefit in the cessation of perception and feeling and have not pursued it. Therefore my mind does not launch out upon the cessation of perception and feeling and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful.'

"Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: 'If, having seen the danger in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, I would cultivate that [insight], and if, having achieved the benefit in the cessation of perception and feeling, I would pursue it, it is then possible that my mind would launch out upon the cessation of perception and feeling and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I see it as peaceful.' Then, sometime later, having seen the danger in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, I cultivated that [insight]; [448] and having achieved the benefit in the cessation of perception and feeling, I pursued it. My mind then launched out upon the cessation of perception and feeling and became placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I saw it as peaceful.

"Sometime later, Ānanda, by completely surmounting the
base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, I entered and dwelled in the cessation of perception and feeling, and having seen with wisdom, my taints were utterly destroyed.

"So long, Ānanda, as I did not attain and emerge from these nine attainments of progressive dwellings in direct order and reverse order, I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans. But when I attained and emerged from these nine attainments of progressive dwellings in direct order and reverse order, then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with... its devas and humans. The knowledge and vision arose in me: 'Unshakable is my liberation of mind; this is my last birth; now there is no more renewed existence.'" [449]

## 42 (1) Confinement

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Venerable Ānanda was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita's Park. Then the Venerable Udāyī approached the Venerable Ānanda and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Ānanda:

"This was said, friend, by the young deva Pañcālacaṇ̣a:

"The sage, the withdrawn chief bull, the Buddha who awakened to jhāna, the One of Broad Wisdom has found the opening amid confinement. ${ }^{1950}$

"What, friend, has the Blessed One spoken of as confinement and what as the achievement of an opening in the midst of confinement? ${ }^{\prime 1951}$

"The Blessed One, friend, has spoken of these five objects of sensual pleasure as confinement. What five?

## Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One

## The First Fifty

## I. BENEFITS

## 1 (1) What Purpose?

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

(1) "Bhante, what is the purpose and benefit of wholesome virtuous behavior?"

(2) "Ānanda, the purpose and benefit of wholesome virtuous behavior is non-regret."

(3) "And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of nonregret?"

"The purpose and benefit of non-regret is joy."

(4) "And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of joy?"

"The purpose and benefit of joy is rapture."

(5) "And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of rapture?"

"The purpose and benefit of rapture is tranquility."

(6) "And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of tranquility?"

"The purpose and benefit of tranquility is pleasure."

(7) "And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of pleasure?"

"The purpose and benefit of pleasure [2] is concentration."
(8) "And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of concentration?"

"The purpose and benefit of concentration is the knowledge and vision of things as they really are."

(9) "And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of the knowledge and vision of things as they really are?"

"The purpose and benefit of the knowledge and vision of things as they really are is disenchantment and dispassion."

(10) "And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of disenchantment and dispassion?"

"The purpose and benefit of disenchantment and dispassion is the knowledge and vision of liberation.

"Thus, Ānandá, (1)-(2) the purpose and benefit of wholesome virtuous behavior is non-regret; (3) the purpose and benefit of non-regret is joy; (4) the purpose and benefit of joy is rapture; (5) the purpose and benefit of rapture is tranquility; (6) the purpose and benefit of tranquility is pleasure; (7) the purpose and benefit of pleasure is concentration; (8) the purpose and benefit of concentration is the knowledge and vision of things as they really are; (9) the purpose and benefit of the knowledge and vision of things as they really are is disenchantment and dispassion; and (10) the purpose and benefit of disenchantment and dispassion is the knowledge and vision of liberation. Thus, Ānanda, wholesome virtuous behavior progressively leads to the foremost."1964

# 2 (2) Volition

(1)-(2) "Bhikkhus, for a virtuous person, one whose behavior is virtuous, no volition need be exerted: 'Let non-regret arise in me.' It is natural ${ }^{1965}$ that non-regret arises in a virtuous person, one whose behavior is virtuous.

(3) "For one without regret no volition need be exerted: 'Let joy arise in me.' It is natural that joy arises in one without regret.

(4) "For one who is joyful no volition need be exerted: 'Let rapture arise in me.' It is natural that rapture arises in one who is joyful. [3]

(5) "For one with a rapturous mind no volition need be exerted: 'Let my body be tranquil.' It is natural that the body of one with a rapturous mind is tranquil.
(6) "For one tranquil in body no volition need be exerted: 'Let me feel pleasure.' It is natural that one tranquil in body feels pleasure.

(7) "For one feeling pleasure no volition need be exerted: 'Let my mind be concentrated.' It is natural that the mind of one feeling pleasure is concentrated.

(8) "For one who is concentrated no volition need be exerted: 'Let me know and see things as they really are.' It is natural that one who is concentrated knows and sees things as they really are.

(9) "For one who knows and sees things as they really are no volition need be exerted: 'Let me be disenchanted and dispassionate.' It is natural that one who knows and sees things as they really are is disenchanted and dispassionate.

(10) "For one who is disenchanted and dispassionate no volition need be exerted: 'Let me realize the knowledge and vision of liberation.' It is natural that one who is disenchanted and dispassionate realizes the knowledge and vision of liberation.

"Thus, bhikkhus, (9)-(10) the knowledge and vision of liberation is the purpose and benefit of disenchantment and dispassion; (8) disenchantment and dispassion are the purpose and benefit of the knowledge and vision of things as they really are; (7) the knowledge and vision of things as they really are is the purpose and benefit of concentration; (6) concentration is the purpose and benefit of pleasure; (5) pleasure is the purpose and benefit of tranquility; (4) tranquility is the purpose and benefit of rapture; (3) rapture is the purpose and benefit of joy; (2) joy is the purpose and benefit of non-regret; and (1) non-regret is the purpose and benefit of virtuous behavior.

"Thus, bhikkhus, one stage [4] flows into the next stage, one stage fills up the next stage, for going from the near shore to the far shore."1966

# 3 (3) Virtuous Behavior ${ }^{1967}$

"Bhikkhus, (1) for an immoral person, for one deficient in virtuous behavior, (2) non-regret lacks its proximate cause. When there is no non-regret, for one deficient in non-regret, (3) joy lacks its proximate cause. When there is no joy, for one deficient in joy, (4) rapture lacks its proximate cause. When there is no rapture, for one deficient in rapture, (5) tranquility lacks
its proximate cause. When there is no tranquility, for one deficient in tranquility, (6) pleasure lacks its proximate cause. When there is no pleasure, for one deficient in pleasure, (7) right concentration lacks its proximate cause. When there is no right concentration, for one deficient in right concentration, (8) the knowledge and vision of things as they really are lacks its proximate cause. When there is no knowledge and vision of things as they really are, for one deficient in the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, (9) disenchantment and dispassion lack their proximate cause. When there is no disenchantment and dispassion, for one deficient in disenchantment and dispassion, (10) the knowledge and vision of liberation lacks its proximate cause.

"Suppose there is a tree deficient in branches and foliage. Then its shoots do not grow to fullness; also its bark, softwood, and heartwood do not grow to fullness. So too, for an immoral person, one deficient in virtuous behavior, non-regret lacks its proximate cause. When there is no non-regret . . . the knowledge and vision of liberation lacks its proximate cause.

"Bhikkhus, (1) for a virtuous person, for one whose behavior is virtuous, (2) non-regret possesses its proximate cause. When there is non-regret, for one possessing non-regret, (3) joy possesses its proximate cause. When there is joy, for one possessing joy, (4) rapture possesses its proximate cause. When there is rapture, for one possessing rapture, (5) tranquility possesses its proximate cause. When there is tranquility, for one possessing tranquility, (6) pleasure possesses its proximate cause. When there is pleasure, for one possessing pleasure, (7) right concentration possesses its proximate cause. [5] When there is right concentration, for one possessing right concentration, (8) the knowledge and vision of things as they really are possesses its proximate cause. When there is the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, for one possessing the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, (9) disenchantment and dispassion possess their proximate cause. When there is disenchantment and dispassion, for one possessing disenchantment and dispassion, (10) the knowledge and vision of liberation possesses its proximate cause.

"Suppose there is a tree possessing branches and foliage. Then its shoots grow to fullness; also its bark, softwood, and
heartwood grow to fullness. So too, for a virtuous person, one whose behavior is virtuous, non-regret possesses its proximate cause. When there is non-regret . . . the knowledge and vision of liberation possesses its proximate cause."

# 4 (4) Proximate Cause

There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus:

[Identical with 10:3, but spoken by Sāriputta.] [6]

## 5 (5) Ananda

There the Venerable Ānanda addressed the bhikkhus:

[Identical with 10:3, but spoken by Ānanda.] [7]

## 6 (6) Concentration

Then the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, could a bhikkhu obtain such a state of concentration that (1) he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth, ${ }^{1988}$ (2) of water in relation to water; (3) of fire in relation to fire; (4) of air in relation to air; (5) of the base of the infinity of space in relation to the base of the infinity of space; (6) of the base of the infinity of consciousness in relation to the base of the infinity of consciousness; (7) of the base of nothingness in relation to the base of nothingness; (8) of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in relation to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; (9) of this world in relation to this world; (10) of the other world in relation to the other world, but he would still be percipient?"

"He could, Ānanda."

"But how, Bhante, could he obtain such a state of concentration?" [8]

"Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu is percipient thus: 'This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, the stilling of all activities, the relinquishing of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, nibbāna. ${ }^{1969}$ It is in this way, Ānanda, that a bhikkhu could obtain such a state of concentration that he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth; of water in relation to water; of fire in relation to fire; of air in relation to air; of the base of the infinity of space in relation to the base of the infinity of space; of the base of the infinity of consciousness in
relation to the base of the infinity of consciousness; of the base of nothingness in relation to the base of nothingness; of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in relation to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; of this world in relation to this world; of the other world in relation to the other world, but he would still be percipient."

# 7 (7) Sāriputta

Then the Venerable Ananda approached the VenerableSāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Sāriputta:

"Friend Sāriputta, could a bhikkhu obtain such a state of concentration that (1) he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth; (2) of water in relation to water; (3) of fire in relation to fire; (4) of air in relation to air; (5) of the base of the infinity of space in relation to the base of the infinity of space; [9] (6) of the base of the infinity of consciousness in relation to the base of the infinity of consciousness; (7) of the base of nothingness in relation to the base of nothingness; (8) of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in relation to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; (9) of this world in relation to this world; (10) of the other world in relation to the other world, but he would still be percipient?"

"He could, friend Ananda."

"But how, friend Sāriputta, could he obtain such a state of concentration?"

"On one occasion, friend Ānanda, I was dwelling right here in Sāvatthī in the Blind Men's Grove. There I attained such a state of concentration that I was not percipient of earth in relation to earth; of water in relation to water; of fire in relation to fire; of air in relation to air; of the base of the infinity of space in relation to the base of the infinity of space; of the base of the infinity of consciousness in relation to the base of the infinity of consciousness; of the base of nothingness in relation to the base of nothingness; of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in relation to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; of this world in relation to this world; of the other world in relation to the other world, but I was still percipient."
"But of what was the Venerable Sāriputta percipient on that occasion?"

"One perception arose and another perception ceased in me: 'The cessation of existence is nibbāna; the cessation of existence is nibbāna. ${ }^{\prime 1970}$ Just as, when a fire of twigs is burning, one flame arises and another flame ceases, so one perception [10] arose and another perception ceased in me: 'The cessation of existence is nibbāna; the cessation of existence is nibbāna.' On that occasion, friend, I was percipient: 'The cessation of existence is nibbāna.'"

# 8 (8) Faith ${ }^{1971}$

(1) "Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu may be endowed with faith but he is not virtuous; thus he is incomplete with respect to that factor. He should fulfill that factor, [thinking]: 'How can I be endowed with faith and also be virtuous?' But when a bhikkhu is endowed with faith and is also virtuous, then he is complete with respect to that factor.

# II. Protector

## 11 (1) Lodging ${ }^{1973}$

"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu who possesses five factors resorts to and uses a lodging that possesses five factors, in no long time, with the destruction of the taints, he might realize for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwell in it.

"And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu possess five factors?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is endowed with faith. He has faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.'

(2) "He is seldom ill or afflicted, possessing an even digestion that is neither too cool nor too hot but moderate and suitable for striving.
(3) "He is honest and open, one who reveals himself as he really is to the Teacher and his wise fellow monks.

(4) "He has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities.

(5) "He is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering.

"It is in this way that a bhikkhu possesses five factors.

"And how does a lodging possess five factors?

(6) "Here, the lodging is neither too far [from a place for alms] nor too close, and it possesses a means for going and returning.

(7) "During the day it is not disturbed by people and at night it is quiet and still.

(8) "There is little contact with flies, mosquitoes, wind, the burning sun, and serpents.

(9) "One dwelling in that lodging can easily obtain robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick.

(10) "In that lodging elder bhikkhus are dwelling who are learned, heirs to the heritage, [16] experts on the Dhamma, experts on the discipline, experts on the outlines. He approaches them from time to time and inquires: 'How is this, Bhante? What is the meaning of this?' Those venerable ones then disclose to him what has not been disclosed, clear up what is obscure, and dispel his perplexity about numerous perplexing points.

"It is in this way that a lodging possesses five factors.

"When a bhikkhu who possesses these five factors resorts to and uses a lodging that possesses these five factors, in no long time, with the destruction of the taints, he might realize for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwell in it."

# 12 (2) Five Factors ${ }^{1974}$

"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who has abandoned five factors and possesses five factors is called, in this Dhamma and discipline, a supreme person who is consummate and has completely lived the spiritual life.

"And how has a bhikkhu abandoned five factors? Here, a
bhikkhu has abandoned sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has abandoned five factors.

"And how does a bhikkhu possess five factors? Here, a bhikkhu possesses the aggregate of virtuous behavior of one beyond training, the aggregate of concentration of one beyond training, the aggregate of wisdom of one beyond training, the aggregate of liberation of one beyond training, and the aggregate of the knowledge and vision of liberation of one beyond training. It is in this way that a bhikkhu possesses five factors.

"When a bhikkhu has abandoned these five factors and possesses these five factors, he is called, in this Dhamma and discipline, a supreme person who is consummate and complete in living the spiritual life."

When sensual desire and ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness, and doubt are totally absent in a bhikkhu; [17] when one like this possesses the virtue and concentration of one beyond training, and [similar] liberation and knowledge; possessing five factors and having removed five factors, he is truly called a consummate one in this Dhamma and discipline.

# 13 (3) Fetters

"Bhikkhus, there are these ten fetters. What ten? The five lower fetters and the five higher fetters. And what are the five lower fetters? Personal-existence view, doubt, wrong grasp of behavior and observances, sensual desire, and ill will. These are the five lower fetters. And what are the five higher fetters? Lust for form, lust for the formless, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. These are the five higher fetters. These, bhikkhus, are the ten fetters."

14 (4) Mental Barrenness ${ }^{1975}$

"Bhikkhus, if any bhikkhu or bhikkhuni has not abandoned five kinds of mental barrenness and eradicated five bondages
of the mind, then, whether night or day comes, only deterioration in wholesome qualities and not growth is to be expected for this person.

"What are the five kinds of mental barrenness that he has not abandoned?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is perplexed about the Teacher, doubts him, is not convinced about him and does not place confidence in him. When a bhikkhu is perplexed about the Teacher, doubts him, is not convinced about him and does not place confidence in him, his mind does not incline to ardor, effort, perseverance, and striving. Since his mind does not incline to ardor ... [18] . . . and striving, this is the first kind of mental barrenness that he has not abandoned.

(3) "Just as all the rafters of a peaked house lean toward the roof peak, slope toward the roof peak, converge upon the roof peak, and the roof peak is declared foremost among them, so too, all wholesome qualities are rooted in heedfulness and converge upon heedfulness and heedfulness is declared foremost among them.

# 19 (9) Abodes of the Noble Ones (1)

"Bhikkhus, there are these ten abodes of the noble ones in which the noble ones of the past, present, or future abide. ${ }^{1981}$ What ten?

"Here, a bhikkhu (1) has abandoned five factors; (2) possesses six factors; (3) has a single guard (4) and four supports; (5) has dispelled personal truths, (6) totally renounced seeking, (7) purified his intentions, (8) tranquilized bodily activity, and become (9) well liberated in mind and (10) well liberated by wisdom. These are the ten abodes of the noble ones in which the noble ones of the past, present, or future abide."

20 (10) Abodes of the Noble Ones (2)

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Kurus near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma. [30] There
the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus. . . . The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, there are these ten abodes of the noble ones in which the noble ones abide in the past, present, or future. What ten?

"Here, a bhikkhu (1) has abandoned five factors; (2) possesses six factors; (3) has a single guard (4) and four supports; (5) has dispelled personal truths, (6) totally renounced seeking, (7) purified his intentions, (8) tranquilized bodily activity, and become (9) well liberated in mind and (10) well liberated by wisdom.

(1) "And how has a bhikkhu abandoned five factors? Here, a bhikkhu has abandoned sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has abandoned five factors.

(2) "And how does a bhikkhu possess six factors? Here, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu is neither joyful nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful and clearly comprehending. Having heard a sound with the ear . . . Having smelled an odor with the nose... Having experienced a taste with the tongue... Having felt a tactile object with the body... Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, a bhikkhu is neither joyful nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful and clearly comprehending. ${ }^{1982}$ It is in this way that a bhikkhu possesses six factors.

(3) "And how does a bhikkhu have a single guard? Here, a bhikkhu possesses a mind guarded by mindfulness. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has a single guard.

(4) "And how does a bhikkhu have four supports? Here, having reflected, a bhikkhu uses some things, patiently endures other things, avoids still other things, and dispels still other things. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has four supports. [31]

(5) "And how has a bhikkhu dispelled personal truths? Here, whatever ordinary personal truths may be held by ordinary ascetics and brahmins-that is, 'The world is eternal' or 'The world is not eternal'; 'The world is finite' or 'The world is infinite'; 'The soul and the body are the same' or 'The soul is one thing and the body another'; 'The Tathāgata exists after death' or 'The Tathāgata does not exist after death' or 'The Tathāgata
both exists and does not exist after death' or 'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death' - a bhikkhu has discarded and dispelled them all, given them up, rejected them, let go of them, abandoned and relinquished them. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has dispelled personal truths.

(6) "And how has a bhikkhu totally renounced seeking? Here, a bhikkhu has abandoned the search for sensual pleasures and the search for existence and has allayed the search for a spiritual life. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has totally renounced seeking.

(7) "And how has a bhikkhu purified his intentions? Here, a bhikkhu has abandoned sensual intention, intention of ill will, and intention of harming. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has purified his intentions.

(8) "And how has a bhikkhu tranquilized bodily activity? Here, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has tranquilized bodily activity.

(9) "And how is a bhikkhu well liberated in mind? Here, a bhikkhu's mind is liberated from lust, hatred, and delusion. It is in this way that a bhikkhu is well liberated in mind.

(10) "And how is a bhikkhu well liberated by wisdom? [32] Here, a bhikkhu understands: 'I have abandoned lust, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising; I have abandoned hatred... abandoned delusion, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising.' It is in this way that a bhikkhu is well liberated by wisdom.

"Bhikkhus, whatever noble ones in the past abided in noble abodes, all abided in these same ten noble abodes. Whatever noble ones in the future will abide in noble abodes, all will abide in these same ten noble abodes. Whatever noble ones at present abide in noble abodes, all abide in these same ten noble abodes.

"These are the ten abodes of the noble ones in which the noble ones abide in the past, present, or future."

# III. The Great Chapter

## 21 (1) The Lion

"Bhikkhus, in the evening the lion, the king of beasts, comes out from his lair, stretches his body, surveys the four quarters all around, [33] and roars his lion's roar three times. Then he sets out in search of game. For what reason? [With the thought:] 'Let me not cause harm to small creatures that might cross my track.'

"The lion,' bhikkhus, is a designation for the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. When the Tathāgata teaches the Dhamma to an assembly, this is his lion's roar.

"Bhikkhus, there are these ten Tathāgata's powers that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he claims the place of the chief bull, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the brahma wheel. ${ }^{1983}$ What ten?

(1) "Here, the Tathāgata understands as it really is the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible. Since the Tathāgata understands as it really is the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible, this is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, on account of which he claims the place of the chief bull, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the brahma wheel.

(2) "Again, the Tathāgata understands as it really is the result of the undertaking of kamma past, future, and present in terms of possibilities and causes. Since the Tathāgata understands as it really is . . . the result of the undertaking of kamma . . . this too is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, on account of which he . . . sets in motion the brahma wheel.

(3) "Again, the Tathāgata understands as it really is the ways leading everywhere. ${ }^{1984}$ Since the Tathāgata understands as it really is the ways leading everywhere, this too is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, on account of which he . . . sets in motion the brahma wheel.

(4) "Again, the Tathāgata [34] understands as it really is the world with its numerous and diverse elements. ${ }^{1985}$ Since the Tathāgata understands as it really is the world with its numerous and diverse elements, this too is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, on account of which ... he sets in motion the brahma wheel.
(5) "Again, the Tathāgata understands as it really is the diversity in the dispositions of beings. ${ }^{1986}$ Since the Tathāgata understands as it really is the diversity in the dispositions of beings, this too is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, on account of which ... he sets in motion the brahma wheel.

(6) "Again, the Tathāgata understands as it really is the superior or inferior condition of the faculties of other beings and persons. ${ }^{1987}$ Since the Tathāgata understands as it really is the superior or inferior condition of the faculties of other beings and persons, this too is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, on account of which ... he sets in motion the brahma wheel.

(7) "Again, the Tathāgata understands as it really is the defilement, the cleansing, and the emergence in regard to the jhānas, emancipations, concentrations, and meditative attainments. Since the Tathāgata understands as it really is the defilement, the cleansing, and the emergence in regard to the jhānas . . . this too is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, on account of which ... he sets in motion the brahma wheel.

(8) "Again, the Tathāgata recollects his manifold past abodes, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty [35] births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many eons of world-dissolution, many eons of worldevolution, many eons of world-dissolution and world-evolution thus: 'There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere, and there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn here.' Thus he recollects his manifold past abodes with their aspects and details. Since the Tathāgata recollects his manifold past abodes . . . with their aspects and details, this too is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, on account of which ... he sets in motion the brahma wheel.

(9) "Again, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, the Tathāgata sees beings passing away and being reborn; inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma thus: 'These beings who
engaged in misconduct by body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong view, and undertook kamma based on wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; but these beings who engaged in good conduct by body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right view, and undertook kamma based on right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.' Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma. [36] Since the Tathāgata... understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma, this too is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, on account of which ... he sets in motion the brahma wheel.

(10) "Again, with the destruction of the taints, the Tathāgata has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. Since the Tathāgata has realized for himself . . . the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom... this too is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, on account of which he claims the place of the chief bull, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the brahma wheel.

"These, bhikkhus, are the ten Tathāgata's powers that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he claims the place of the chief bull, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the brahma wheel."

# 22 (2) Doctrinal Principles

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Ānanda, I claim to be confident about the things that lead to the realization by direct knowledge of the various doctrinal principles, ${ }^{1988}$ [and I am thus able] to teach the Dhamma to various people in various ways such that one who practices accordingly will know of what exists that it exists and of what
does not exist that it does not exist; such that one will know of the inferior that it is inferior and of the sublime that it is sublime; such that one will know of what is surpassable that it is surpassable and of what is unsurpassable that it is unsurpassable; such that [37] it is possible that one will know, see, and realize this just as it is to be known, seen, and realized.

"But among knowledges, Ānanda, this one is unsurpassed, namely, the knowledge of these things and those things as they really are. ${ }^{1989}$ And, I say, there is no other knowledge higher or more excellent than this.

"Bhikkhus, there are things to be abandoned by body, not by speech. There are things to be abandoned by speech, not by body. There are things to be abandoned neither by body nor by speech but by having repeatedly seen with wisdom. ${ }^{1990}$

"And what, bhikkhus, are the things to be abandoned by body, not by speech? Here, a bhikkhu has committed a particular unwholesome deed with the body. His wise fellow monks investigate him and say thus: 'You have committed a particular unwholesome deed with the body. It would really be good if you would abandon bodily misconduct and develop bodily good conduct.' When his wise fellow monks investigate him and speak to him, he abandons bodily misconduct and develops bodily good conduct. These are called things to be abandoned by body, not by speech.

"And what are the things to be abandoned by speech, not by body? Here, a bhikkhu has committed a particular unwholesome deed by speech. His wise fellow monks investigate him and say thus: 'You have committed a particular unwholesome deed by speech. It would really be good if you would abandon
verbal misconduct and develop verbal good conduct.' When his wise fellow monks investigate him and speak to him, he abandons verbal misconduct and develops verbal good conduct. These are called things to be abandoned by speech, not by body.

"And what are the things to be abandoned neither by body nor by speech but by having repeatedly seen with wisdom? Greed is to be abandoned neither by body nor by speech but by having repeatedly seen with wisdom. Hatred . . . Delusion . . . Anger . . . Hostility . . . Denigration . . . Insolence [40] . . . Miserliness is to be abandoned neither by body nor by speech but by having repeatedly seen with wisdom.

"Evil envy, ${ }^{1991}$ bhikkhus, is to be abandoned neither by body nor by speech but by having repeatedly seen with wisdom. And what is evil envy? Here, a householder or householder's son is prospering in wealth or grain, in silver or gold. A slave or dependent might think of him: 'Oh, may this householder or householder's son not prosper in wealth or grain, in silver or gold!' Or else an ascetic or brahmin gains robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick. Another ascetic or brahmin might think of him: 'Oh, may this venerable one not gain robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick!' This is called evil envy. Evil envy is to be abandoned neither by body nor by speech but by having repeatedly seen with wisdom.

"Evil desire, bhikkhus, is to be abandoned neither by body nor by speech but by having repeatedly seen with wisdom. And what is evil desire? Here, one without faith desires: 'Let them know me as one endowed with faith.' An immoral person desires: 'Let them know me as virtuous.' One with little learning desires: 'Let them know me as learned.' One who delights in company desires: 'Let them know me as solitary.' One who is lazy desires: 'Let them know me as energetic.' One who is muddle-minded desires: 'Let them know me as mindful.' One who is unconcentrated desires: 'Let them know me as concentrated.' One who is unwise desires: 'Let them know me as wise.' One whose taints are not destroyed desires: 'Let them know me as one whose taints are destroyed.' [41] This is called evil desire. Evil desire is to be abandoned neither by body nor by speech but by having repeatedly seen with wisdom.

"If, bhikkhus, greed overcomes that bhikkhu and continues
on; if hatred . . . delusion . . . anger . . . hostility . . . denigration . . . insolence . . . miserliness . . . evil envy . . . evil desire overcomes that bhikkhu and continues on, ${ }^{1992}$ he should be understood thus: 'This venerable one does not understand in such a way that he would have no greed; thus greed overcomes him and continues on.

# 24 (4) Cunda

On one occasion the Venerable Mahācunda was dwelling among the Cetis at Sahajāti. There the Venerable Mahācunda addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend!" those [42] bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Mahācunda said this:

"Friends, making a declaration of knowledge, a bhikkhu says: 'I know this Dhamma, I see this Dhamma. ${ }^{1993}$ If, however, greed overcomes that bhikkhu and persists; ${ }^{1994}$ if hatred . . . delusion . . . anger . . . hostility . . . denigration . . . insolence . . . miserliness... evil envy . . . evil desire overcomes that bhikkhu and persists, he should be understood thus: 'This venerable one does not understand in such a way that he would have no greed; thus greed overcomes him and persists.

"Friends, making a deelaration-of-development, a bhikkhu
says: 'I am developed in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom.'

"Friends, making a declaration of knowledge and development, a bhikkhu says: 'I know this Dhamma, I see this Dhamma. I am developed in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom.' If, however, greed overcomes that bhikkhu and persists; if hatred . . evil desire [43] overcomes that bhikkhu and persists, he should be understood thus: 'This venerable one does not understand in such a way that he would have no greed; thus greed overcomes him and persists.

For what reason? Because when he wants to buy something, he cannot pay with money, grain, silver, or gold.

"So too, friends, making a declaration of knowledge and development, a bhikkhu says: 'I know this Dhamma, I see this Dhamma. I am developed in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom.'. If, however, greed overcomes that bhikkhu and persists . . evil desire overcomes that bhikkhu and persists, he should be understood thus: 'This venerable one does not understand in such a way that he would have no greed; thus greed overcomes him and persists.

# 25 (5) Kasinas

"Bhikkhus, there are these ten kasina bases. ${ }^{1995}$ What ten? One person perceives the earth kasina above, below, across, nondual, measureless. ${ }^{1996}$ One person perceives the water kasina . . . the fire kasina . . . the air kasina . . . the blue kasina . . . the yellow kasina . . . the red kasina . . . the white kasina . . . the space kasina . . . the consciousness kasina above, below, across, nondual, measureless.

## 26 (6) Kālī

On one occasion the Venerable Mahākaccāna was dwelling among the people of Avantī on Mount Pavatta at Kuraraghara. Then the female lay follower Kālī of Kuraraghara approached him, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: ${ }^{1997}$

"Bhante, this was said by the Blessed One in 'The Maidens' Questions' ${ }^{1998}$

"'Having conquered the army of the pleasant and agreeable,

meditating alone, I discovered bliss, the attainment of the goal, the peace of the heart.

Therefore I don't form intimate ties with people, nor does intimacy with anyone get a chance with me.' [47]

"How, Bhante, is the meaning of this statement that the Blessed One spoke in brief to be seen in detail?"

"Some ascetics and brahmins; sister, for whom the attainment of the earth kasina is supreme, generated it as their goal. ${ }^{1999}$ The Blessed One directly knew to what extent the attainment of the earth kasina is supreme. Having directly known this, he saw the beginning, ${ }^{2000}$ the danger, and the escape, and he saw the knowledge and vision of the path and the non-path. By seeing the beginning, the danger, and the escape, and by seeing the knowledge and vision of the path and the non-path, he knew the attainment of the goal, the peace of the heart.
"Some ascetics and brahmins, sister, for whom the attainment of the water kasina . . . the fire kasina . . . the air kasina . . . the blue kasina . . . the yellow kasina . . . the red kasina . . . the white kasina . . . the space kasina . . . the consciousness kasina is supreme, generated it as their goal. The Blessed One directly knew to what extent the attainment of the consciousness kasina is supreme. Having directly known this, he saw the beginning, the danger, and the escape, and he saw the knowledge and vision of the path and the non-path. By seeing the beginning, the danger, and the escape, and by seeing the knowledge and vision of the. path and the non-path, he knew the attainment of the goal, the peace of the heart.

"Thus, sister, it is in such a way that the meaning should be seen in detail of this statement that the Blessed One spoke in brief in 'The Maidens' Questions':

"Having conquered the army of the pleasant and agreeable, meditating alone, I discovered bliss, the attainment of the goal, the peace of the heart. [48] Therefore I don't form intimate ties with people, nor does intimacy with anyone succeed in my case.'"

# 27 (7) Great Questions (1).

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇ̣ika's Park. Then, in the morning, a number of bhikkhus dressed, took their bowls and robes, and entered Sāvatthī for alms. Then it occurred to those bhikkhus: "It is still too early to walk for alms in Sāvatthī. Let us go to the park of the wanderers of other sects."

Then those bhikkhus went to the park of the wanderers of other sects. They exchanged greetings with those wanderers and, when they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, sat down to one side. Those wanderers then said to them:

"Friends, the ascetic Gotama teaches the Dhamma to his disciples in such a way as this: 'Come, bhikkhus, directly know all phenomena. ${ }^{2001}$ Dwell having directly known all phenomena. ${ }^{2002}$ We too teach the Dhamma to our disciples in such a way as this: 'Come, friends, directly know all phenomena. Dwell having directly known all phenomena.' What now is the distinction,
the disparity, the difference between the ascetic Gotama's [49] teaching of the Dhamma and our teaching, between his instruction and our instruction?"

Then those bhikkhus neither applauded nor rejected the statement of those wanderers. Without applauding it, without rejecting it, they rose from their seats and left, [thinking]: "We shall find out what the Blessed One has to say about this statement."

Then, when those bhikkhus had walked for alms in Sāvatthī, after their meal, on returning from their alms round, they approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: "Here, Bhante, in the morning, we dressed, took our bowls and robes, and entered Sāvatthī for alms. ... [They here report the entire course of events, down to:] [50] We rose from our seats and left, [thinking]: 'We shall find out what the Blessed One has to say about this statement.'"

"Bhikkhus, when wanderers of other sects speak thus, they should be answered in this way: 'A question about one, a concise statement about one, an explanation of one. ${ }^{203}$ A question about two, a concise statement about two, an explanation of two. A question about three, a concise statement about three, an explanation of three. A question about four, a concise statement about four, an explanation of four.

A question about nine, a concise statement about nine, an explanation of nine. A question about ten, a concise statement about ten, an explanation of ten. If wanderers of other sects were questioned thus, they would not be able to reply and, further, they would meet with distress. For what reason? Because that would not be within their domain. I do not see anyone, bhikkhus, in the world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, who could satisfy the mind with an answer to these questions apart from the Tathāgata or a disciple of the Tathāgata or one who has heard it from them.

(2) "Bhikkhus, as far as sun and moon revolve and light up the quarters with their brightness, so far the thousandfold world system extends. ${ }^{2016}$ In that thousandfold world system there are a thousand moons, a thousand suns, a thousand Sinerus king of mountains, a thousand Jambudīpas, a thousand Aparagoyānas, a thousand Uttarakurus, a thousand Pubbavidehas, and a thousand four great oceans; a thousand four great kings, a thousand [heavens ruled by] the four great kings, a thousand Tāvatimsa [heavens], a thousand Yāma [heavens], a thousand Tusita [heavens], a thousand [heavens] of devas who delight in creation, a thousand [heavens] of devas who control what is
created by others, a thousand brahmā worlds. As far, bhikkhus, as this thousandfold world system extends, Mahābrahmā [60] there ranks as the foremost. But even for Mahābrahmā there is alteration; there is change. Seeing this thus, the instructed noble disciple becomes disenchanted with it; being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate toward the foremost, not to speak of what is inferior.

(3) "There comes a time, bhikkhus, when this world dissolves. When the world is dissolving, beings for the most part migrate to the devas of streaming radiance. ${ }^{2017}$ There they exist mindmade, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the. skies, living in glory, and they remain thus for a very long time. When the world is dissolving, the devas of streaming radiance rank as the foremost. But even for these devas there is alteration; there is change. Seeing this thus, the instructed noble disciple becomes disenchanted with it; being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate toward the foremost, not to speak of what is inferior.

(4) "Bhikkhus, there are these ten kasina bases. ${ }^{2088}$ What ten? One person perceives the earth kasina above, below, across, undivided, measureless. One person perceives the water kasina . . . the fire kasina . . . the air kasina . . . the blue kasina . . . the yellow kasina... the red kasina... the white kasina... the space kasina ... the consciousness kasina above, below, across, undivided, measureless. These are the ten kasina bases. Of these ten kasina bases, this is the foremost, namely, when one per»eives the consciousness kasina above, below, across, undivided, measureless. There are beings who are percipient in such a way. But even for beings who are percipient in such a way there is alteration; there is change. Seeing this thus, [61] bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple becomes disenchanted with it; being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate toward the foremost, not to speak of what is inferior.

(5) "Bhikkhus, there are these eight bases of overcoming. ${ }^{2019}$ What eight?

(i) "One percipient of forms internally sees forms externally, limited, beautiful or ugly. Having overcome them, he is percipient thus: 'I know, I see.' This is the first basis of overcoming.

(ii) "One percipient of forms internally sees forms externally, measureless, beautiful or ugly. Having overcome them,
he is percipient thus: 'I know, I see.' This is the second basis of overcoming.

(iii) "One not percipient of forms internally sees forms externally, limited, beautiful or ugly. Having overcome them, he is percipient thus: 'I know, I see.' This is the third basis of overcoming.

(iv) "One not percipient of forms internally sees forms externally, measureless, beautiful or ugly. Having overcome them, he is percipient thus: 'I know, I see.' This is the fourth basis of overcoming.

(v) "One not percipient of forms internally sees forms externally, blue ones, blue in color, with a blue hue, with a blue tint. Just as the flax flower is blue, blue in color, with a blue hue, with a blue tint, or just as Bārānasī cloth, smoothened on both sides, might be blue, blue in color, with a blue hue, with a blue tint, so too, one not percipient of forms internally sees forms externally, blue ones.... Having overcome them, he is percipient thus: 'I know, I see.' This is the fifth basis of overcoming.

(vi) "One not percipient of forms internally sees forms externally, yellow ones, with a yellow hue, with a yellow tint. Just as the kanikāra flower is yellow, yellow in color, with a yellow hue, with a yellow tint, or just as Bārānasī cloth, [62] smoothened on both sides, might be yellow, yellow in color, with a yellow hue, with a yellow tint, so too, one not percipient of forms internally sees forms externally, yellow ones.... Having overcome them, he is percipient thus: 'I know, I see.' This is the sixth basis of overcoming.

(vii) "One not percipient of forms internally sees forms externally, red ones, with a red hue, with a red tint. Just as the bandhujivaka flower is red, red in color, with a red hue, with a red tint, or just as Bārānasī cloth, smoothened on both sides, might be red, red in color with a red hue, with a red tint, so too, one not percipient of forms internally sees forms externally, red ones. . . . Having overcome them, he is percipient thus: 'I know, I see.' This is the seventh basis of overcoming.

(viii) "One not percipient of forms internally sees forms externally, white ones, white in color, with a white hue, with a white tint. Just as the morning star is white, white in color, with a white hue, with a white tint, or just as Bārānasī cloth, smoothened on both sides, might be white, white in color, with
a white hue, with a white tint, so too, one not percipient of forms internally sees forms externally, white ones.... Having overcome them, he is percipient thus: 'I know, I see.' This is the eighth basis of overcoming.

"These are the eight bases of overcoming. Of these eight bases of overcoming, this is the foremost, namely, that one not percipient of forms internally sees forms externally, white ones, white in color with a white hue, with a white tint, and having overcome them, he is percipient thus: 'I know, I see.' There are beings who are percipient in such a way. But even for beings who are percipient in such a way there is [63] alteration; there is change. Seeing this thus, the instructed noble disciple becomes disenchanted with it; being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate toward the foremost, not to speak of what is inferior.

(6) "Bhikkhus, there are these four modes of practice. ${ }^{2020}$ What four? Practice that is painful with sluggish direct knowledge; practice that is painful with quick direct knowledge; practice that is pleasant with sluggish direct knowledge; and practice that is pleasant with quick direct knowledge. These are the four modes of practice. Of these four modes of practice, this is the foremost, namely, practice that is pleasant with quick direct knowledge. There are beings who practice in such a way. But even for beings who practice in such a way there is alteration; there is change. Seeing this thus, the instructed noble disciple becomes disenchanted with it; being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate toward the foremost, not to speak of what is inferior.

(7) "Bhikkhus, there are these four modes of perception. What four? One person perceives what is limited; another perceives what is exalted; another perceives what is measureless; and still another, [perceiving] 'There is nothing,' perceives the base of nothingness. ${ }^{2021}$ These are the four modes of perception. Of these four modes of perception, this is the foremost, namely, when, [perceiving] 'There is nothing,' one perceives the base of nothingness. There are beings who perceive in such a way. But even for beings who perceive in such a way there is alteration; there is change. Seeing this thus, the instructed noble disciple becomes disenchanted with it; being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate toward the foremost, not to speak of what is inferior.

(8) "Bhikkhus, of the speculative views held by outsiders, this is the foremost, namely: 'I might not be and it might not be
mine; I shall not be, [and] it will not be mine. ${ }^{12032}$ For it can be expected that one who holds such a view will not be unrepelled by existence [64] and will not be repelled by the cessation of existence. ${ }^{2033}$ There are beings who hold such a view. But even for beings who hold such a view there is alteration; there is change. Seeing this thus, the instructed noble disciple becomes disenchanted with it; being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate toward the foremost, not to speak of what is inferior.

(9) "Bhikkhus, there are some ascetics and brahmins who proclaim supreme purification. ${ }^{2024}$ Of those who proclaim supreme purification, this is the foremost, namely, by completely surmounting the base of nothingness, one enters and dwells in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. They teach their Dhamma for the direct knowledge and realization of this. There are beings who assert thus. But even for those who assert thus, there is alteration; there is change. Seeing this thus, the instructed noble disciple becomes disenchanted with it; being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate toward the foremost, not to speak of what is inferior.

(10) "Bhikkhus, there are some ascetics and brahmins who proclaim supreme nibbāna in this very life. ${ }^{2025}$ Of those who proclaim supreme nibbāna in this very life, this is the foremost, namely, emancipation through non-clinging after one has seen as they really are the origin and passing away, the gratification, danger, and escape in regard to the six bases for contact.

"Bhikkhus, though I assert and declare [my teaching] in such a way, some ascetics and brahmins untruthfully, baselessly, falsely, and wrongly misrepresent me, [by saying]: 'The ascetic Gotama does not proclaim the full understanding of sensual pleasures, the full understanding of forms, or the full understanding of feelings.' [65] But, bhikkhus, I do proclaim the full understanding of sensual pleasures, the full understanding of forms, and the full understanding of feelings. In this very life, hungerless, quenched, and cooled, I proclaim final nibbāna through non-clinging. ${ }^{\prime 2026}$

# 30 (10) Kosala (2)

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Now on that occasion King Pasenadi of Kosala had returned from the war front, victorious
in battle, his purpose having been achieved. ${ }^{2027}$ Then King Pasenadi of Kosala set out for the park. He went by carriage as far as the ground was suitable for a carriage, and then he dismounted from his carriage and entered the park on foot. Now, on that occasion a number of bhikkhus were walking back and forth in the open air. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala approached those bhikkhus and asked them:

"Bhante, where is the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One now dwelling? For I wish to see the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One."

"Great king, that is his dwelling with the closed door. Approach it quietly. Without hurrying, enter the porch, clear your throat, and tap on the bolt. The Blessed One will open the door for you."

Then, King Pasenadi of Kosala went quietly up to the dwelling with the closed door. Without hurrying, he entered the porch, cleared his throat, and tapped on the bolt. The Blessed One opened the door.

Then King Pasenadi of Kosala entered the dwelling, prostrated himself with his head at the Blessed One's feet, and covered the Blessed One's feet with kisses and caressed them with his hands, pronouncing his name: "Bhante, I am King Pasenadi of Kosala! Bhante, I am King [66] Pasenadi of Kosala!"2028

"But, great king, what reasons do you have for showing such supreme honor to this body and displaying such an offering of loving-kindness?"

"Bhante, it is out of my gratitude and thankfulness that I show such supreme honor toward the Blessed One and display such an offering of loving-kindness to him.

(1) "For, Bhante, the Blessed One is practicing for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people; he has established many people in the noble method, that is, in the way of the good Dhamma, in the way of the wholesome Dhamma. ${ }^{2029}$ This is one reason I show such supreme honor toward the Blessed One and display such an offering of lovingkindness to him.

(2) "Again, Bhante, the Blessed One is virtuous, of mature behavior, of noble behavior, of wholesome behavior, possessing wholesome behavior. This is another reason I show such supreme honor toward the Blessed One. . .
(3) "Again, Bhante, for a long time the Blessed One has been a forest-dweller who resorts to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves. Since that is [67] so, this is another reason I show such supreme honor toward the Blessed One....

(4) "Again, Bhante, the Blessed One is content with any kind of robe, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick. This is another reason I show such supreme honor toward the Blessed One....

(5) "Again, Bhante, the Blessed One is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. This is another reason I show such supreme honor toward the Blessed One....

(6) "Again, Bhante, the Blessed One gets to hear at will, without trouble or difficulty, talk concerned with the austere life that leads to the elimination [of defilements], that is conducive to opening up the heart, that is, talk on fewness of desires, on contentment, on solitude, on not getting bound up [with others], on arousing energy, on virtuous behavior, on concentration, on wisdom, on liberation, on the knowledge and vision of liberation. This is another reason I show such supreme honor toward the Blessed One....

(7) "Again, Bhante, the Blessed One gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life. [68] This is another reason I show such supreme honor toward the Blessed One....

(8) "Again, Bhante, the Blessed One recollects his manifold past abodes, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many eons of world-dissolution, many eons of world-evolution, many eons of world-dissolution and world-evolution thus: 'There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere, and there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn here.' Thus he recollects his
manifold past abodes with their aspects and details. Since that is so, this is another reason I show such supreme honor toward the Blessed One....

(9) "Again, Bhante, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, the Blessed One sees beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma thus: 'These beings who engaged in misconduct by body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, [69] held wrong view, and undertook kamma based on wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; but these beings who engaged in good conduct by body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right view, and undertook kamma based on right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in a good destination, in the heavenly world.' Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma. Since that is so, this is another reason I show such supreme honor toward the Blessed One....

(10) "Again, Bhante, with the destruction of the taints, the Blessed One has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. Since that is so, this is another reason I show such supreme honor toward the Blessed One and display such an offering of loving-kindness to him.

"And now, Bhante, we must be going. We are busy and have much to do."

"You may go, great king, at your own convenience."

Then King Pasenadi of Kosala rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed. [70]

# IV. UpĀLI

## 31 (1) Upāli

Then the Venerable Upāli approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, on how many grounds has the Tathāgata prescribed the training rules ${ }^{2033}$ for his disciples and recited the Pātimokkha?"

"It is, Upāli, on ten grounds that the Tathāgata has prescribed the training rules for his disciples and recited the Pātimokkha. What ten? (1) For the well-being of the Sangha; (2) for the ease of the Sangha; (3) for keeping recalcitrant persons in check; (4) so that well-behaved bhikkhus can dwell at ease; (5) for the restraint of taints pertaining to this present life; (6) for the dispelling of taints pertaining to future lives; (7) so that those without confidence might gain confidence; and (8) for increasing [the confidence] of those with confidence; (9) for the continuation of the good Dhamma; and (10) for promoting discipline.

"It is on these ten grounds that the Tathāgata has prescribed the training rules for his disciples and recited the Pātimokkha."

## 32 (2) Suspending ${ }^{2031}$

"Bhante, how many reasons are there for suspending the Pātimokkha?"

"There are, Upāli, ten reasons for suspending the Pātimokkha. What ten? (1) One who has committed a päräjika is sitting in that assembly; (2) a discussion about one who has committed a pārā̄ika is underway; ${ }^{2032}$ (3) one not fully ordained is sitting in that assembly; [71] (4) a discussion about one not fully ordained is underway; (5) one who has given up the training is sitting in that assembly; (6) a discussion about one who has given up the training is underway; (7) a eunuch is sitting in that assembly; ${ }^{2033}$ (8) a discussion about a eunuch is underway; (9) a seducer of a bhikkhunī is sitting in that assembly; ${ }^{2034}$ (10) a discussion about a seducer of a bhikkhunī is underway. These are the ten reasons for suspending the Pātimokkha."

## 33 (3) Adjudication

"Bhante, how many qualities should a bhikkhu possess to be agreed upon to adjudicate [in a disciplinary issue]?"2035
"A bhikkhu who possesses ten qualities, Upāli, may be agreed upon to adjudicate [in a disciplinary issue]. What ten? (1) Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. (2) He has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and accumulates what he has learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life-such teachings as thesehe has learned much of, retained in mind, recited verbally, investigated mentally, and penetrated well by view. (3) Both Pātimokkhas have been well transmitted to him in detail, well analyzed, well mastered, well determined in terms of the rules and their detailed explication. (4) He is firm in the discipline, immovable. (5) He is able to convince those on both sides of the issue, to describe matters to them, to persuade them, to demonstrate to them, and to placate them. (6) He is skilled in the origination and [72] settlement of disciplinary issues. (7) He knows what a disciplinary issue is. ${ }^{2036}$ (8) He knows the origin of a disciplinary issue. (9) He knows the cessation of a disciplinary issue. (10) He knows the way leading to the cessation of a disciplinary issue. ${ }^{2077}$ A bhikkhu who possesses these ten qualities may be agreed upon to adjudicate [in a disciplinary issue]."

# 34 (4) Full Ordination

"Bhante, how many qualities should a bhikkhu possess to give full ordination?"

"A bhikkhu who possesses ten qualities, Upāli, may give full ordination. What ten? (1) Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous . . . he trains in them. (2) He has learned much . . . and penetrated well by view. (3) Both Pātimokkhas have been well transmitted to him in detail, well analyzed, well mastered, well determined in terms of the rules and their detailed explication. (4) He is able to look after a patient or to get someone else to look after him. (5) He is able to eliminate one's dissatisfaction or to get someone else to eliminate it. (6) He is able to use the Dhamma to dispel regrets that might arise [in his pupils]. (7) He is able to dissuade them, by way of the Dhamma, from erroneous views that have arisen. (8) He is able to encourage them in the higher virtuous
behavior. (9) He is able to encourage them in the higher mind. (10) He is able to encourage them in the higher wisdom. A bhikkhu who possesses these ten qualities may give full ordination." [73]

# 35 (5) Dependence

"Bhante, how many qualities should a bhikkhu possess to give dependence?"

"A bhikkhu who possesses ten qualities, Upāli, may give dependence. What ten?"...

[The same ten qualities as in the preceding sutta.]

"A bhikkhu who possesses these ten qualities may give dependence."

36 (6) Novice ${ }^{2038}$

"Bhante, how many qualities should a bhikkhu possess to be attended upon by a novice?"

"A bhikkhu who possesses ten qualities, Upāli, may be attended upon by a novice. What ten?"...

[The same ten qualities as in 10:34.]

"A bhikkhu who possesses these ten qualities may beattended upon by a novice."

## 37 (7) Schism (1)

"Bhante, it is said: 'Schism in the Sangha, schism in the Sangha.' How, Bhante, is there schism in the Sangha?"

"Here, Upāli, (1) bhikkhus explain non-Dhamma as Dhamma, (2) and Dhamma as non-Dhamma. (3) They explain non-. discipline as discipline, [74] and (4) discipline as non-discipline. (5) They explain what has not been stated and uttered by the Tathāgata as having been stated and uttered by him, and (6) what has been stated and uttered by the Tathāgata as not having been stated and uttered by him. (7) They explain what has not been practiced by the Tathāgata as having been practiced by him, and (8) what has been practiced by the Tathāgata as not having been practiced by him. (9) They explain what has not been prescribed by the Tathāgata as having been prescribed by him, and (10) what has been prescribed by the Tathāgata as not having been prescribed by him. On these ten grounds they withdraw and go apart. They perform legal acts separately and
recite the Pātimokkha separately. It is in this way, Upāli, that there is schism in the Sangha."

38 (8) Schism (2)

"Bhante, it is said: 'Concord in the Sangha, concord in the Sangha.' How is there concord in the Sangha?"

"Here, Upāli, (1) bhikkhus explain non-Dhamma as nonDhamma, and (2) Dhamma as Dhamma. (3) They explain nondiscipline as non-discipline, and (4) discipline as discipline. (5) They explain what has not been stated and uttered by the Tathāgata as not having been stated and uttered by him, and (6) what has been stated and uttered by the Tathāgata as having been stated and uttered by him. (7) They explain what has not been practiced by the Tathāgata as not having been practiced by him, and (8) what has been practiced by the Tathāgata as having been practiced by him. (9) They explain what has not been prescribed by the Tathāgata as not having been prescribed by him, and (10) what has been prescribed by the Tathāgata as having been prescribed by him. On these ten grounds, they do not withdraw and go apart. They do not perform legal acts separately or recite the Pātimokkha separately. It is in this way, Upāli, that there is concord in the Sangha." [75]

# 39 (9) Ānanda (1)

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, it is said: 'Schism in the Sangha, schism in the Sangha.' How is there schism in the Sangha?"

"Here, Ānanda, (1) bhikkhus explain non-Dhamma as Dhamma ... [as in 10:37] . . . and (10) what has been prescribed by the Tathāgata as not having been prescribed by him. On these ten grounds they withdraw and go apart. They perform legal acts separately and recite the Pātimokkha separately. It is in this way, Ānanda, that there is schism in the Sangha. ${ }^{\prime 2039}$

"But, Bhante, when one causes schism in a harmonious Sangha, what does one generate?"

"One generates evil lasting for an eon, Ānanda. ${ }^{\prime 2040}$

"But, Bhante, what is that evil lasting for an eon?"

"One is tormented in hell for an eon, Ānanda." [76]

One who causes schism in the Sangha is bound for misery,

bound for hell, to abide there for an eon.

Delighting in factions, established in non-Dhamma, he falls away from security from bondage.

Having caused schism in a harmonious Sangha, he is tormented in hell for an eon.

40 (10) Ananda (2)

"Bhante, it is said: 'Concord in the Sangha, concord in the Sangha.' How is there concord in the Sangha?"

"Here, Ānanda, (1) bhikkhus explain non-Dhamma as nonDhamma... [as in 10:38]... and (10) what has been prescribed by the Tathāgata as having been prescribed by him. On these ten grounds they do not withdraw and go apart. They do not perform legal acts separately or recite the Pātimokkha separately. It is in this way, Ānanda, that there is concord in the Sangha." ${ }^{204}$

"But, Bhante, when one reconciles a divided Sangha, what does one generate?"

"One generates divine merit, Ānanda."

"But, Bhante, what is divine merit?"

"One rejoices in heaven for an eon, Ānanda." [77]

Pleasant is concord in the Sangha, and the mutual help ${ }^{2042}$ of those who live in concord. Delighting in concord, established in Dhamma, one does not fall away from security from bondage. Having brought concord to the Sangha, one rejoices in heaven for an eon.

# V. INSULTS

41 (1) Disputes

Then the Venerable Upāli approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, why is it that arguments, quarrels, contention, and disputes arise in the Sangha and bhikkhus do not dwell at ease?"

"Here, Upāli, (1) bhikkhus explain non-Dhamma as Dhamma
... [as in 10:37]... [78]... and (10) what has been prescribed by the Tathāgata as not having been prescribed by him. This, Upāli, is why arguments, quarrels, contention, and disputes arise in the Sangha and bhikkhus do not dwell at ease."

# 42 (2) Roots (1)

"Bhante, how many roots of disputes are there?"

"There are, Upāli, ten roots of disputes. What ten? Here, (1) bhikkhus explain non-Dhamma as Dhamma... [as in 10:37]... and (10) what has been prescribed by the Tathāgata as not having been prescribed by him. These, Upāli, are the ten roots of disputes."

## 43 (3) Roots (2)

"Bhante, how many roots of disputes are there?"

"There are, Upāli, ten roots of disputes. What ten? Here, (1) bhikkhus explain what is no offense as an offense, and (2) what is an offense as no offense. (3) They explain a light offense as a grave offense, and (4) a grave offense as a light offense. (5) They explain a coarse offense as not a coarse offense, and (6) an offense that is not coarse as a coarse offense. (7) They explain a remediable offense as an irremediable offense, and (8) an irremediable offense as a remediable offense. [79] (9) They explain an offense with redress as an offense without redress, and (10) an offense without redress as an offense with redress. ${ }^{2043}$ These, Upāli, are the ten roots of disputes."

## 44 (4) Kusinārā

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kusinārā, in the forest thicket of oblations. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who wishes to reprove another person should examine himself with respect to five things and establish five things in himself before he reproves the other person. ${ }^{2044}$ With respect to what five things should he examine himself?

(1) "Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who wishes to reprove another should examine himself thus: 'Is my bodily behavior pure? Do I possess bodily behavior that is pure, flawless, and irreproach-
able? Does this quality exist in me or not?' If the bhikkhu's bodily behavior is not pure, and he does not possess bodily behavior that is pure, flawless, and irreproachable, there will be those who say to him: 'Please first train yourself bodily.' There will be those who say this to him.

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu who wishes to reprove another should examine himself thus: 'Is my verbal behavior pure? Do I possess verbal behavior that is pure, flawless, and irreproachable? Does this quality exist in me or not?' If the bhikkhu's verbal behavior is not pure, and he does not possess verbal behavior that is pure, flawless, and irreproachable, there will be those who say. to him: 'Please first train yourself verbally.' There will be those who say this to him. [80]

(3) "Again, a bhikkhu who wishes to reprove another should examine himself thus: 'Have I established a mind of lovingkindness without resentment toward my fellow monks? Does this quality exist in me or not?' If the bhikkhu has not established a mind of loving-kindness without resentment toward his fellow monks, there will be those who say to him: 'Please first establish a mind of loving-kindness toward your fellow monks.' There will be those who say this to him.

(4) "Again, a bhikkhu who wishes to reprove another should examine himself thus: 'Am I learned, and do I retain and preserve what I have learned? Have I learned much of those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life? Have I retained them in mind, recited them verbally, mentally investigated them, and penetrated them well by view? Does this quality exist in me or not?' If the bhikkhu is not learned . . . and has not penetrated them well by view, there will be those who say to him: 'Please first learn the heritage.' There will be those who say this to him.

(5) "Again, a bhikkhu who wishes to reprove another should examine himself thus: 'Have both Pātimokkhas been well transmitted to me in detail, well analyzed, well mastered, well determined in terms of the rules and their detailed explication? Does there exist in me this quality or not?' If both Pātimokkhas [81] have not been well transmitted to him in detail . . . in terms of the rules and their detailed explication, and if, when asked: 'Where
did the Blessed One state this?' he is unable to reply, there will be those who say to him: 'Please first learn the discipline.' There will be those who say this to him.

"It is with respect to these five things that he should examine himself.

"And what are the five things that he should establish in himself? [He should consider:] '(6) I will speak at a proper time, not at an improper time; (7) I will speak truthfully, not falsely; (8) I will speak gently, not harshly; (9) I will speak in a beneficial way, not in a harmful way; (10) I will speak with a mind of loving-kindness, not while harboring hatred.' These are the five things that he should establish in himself.

"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who wishes to reprove another person should examine himself with respect to these five things and establish these five things in himself before he reproves the other person."

# 45 (5) Entering

"Bhikkhus, there are these ten dangers in entering the king's inner palace. What ten?

(1) "Here, the king is sitting with his queen. The bhikkhu enters, and either the queen smiles when she sees the bhikkhu or the bhikkhu smiles when he sees the queen. The king thinks: 'Surely, something has gone on between them, or something is about to go on.' This is the first danger in entering the king's inner palace.

(2) "Again, when the king has been busy, engaged with much work, he has had intercourse with one of the women but does not remember this, and because of their relations she has become pregnant. The king thinks: 'No one [82] else has entered here except the monk. Could this be the monk's work?' This is the second danger in entering the king's inner palace.

(3) "Again, a gem has been lost in the king's inner palace. The king thinks: 'No one else has entered here except the monk. Could this be the monk's work?' This is the third danger in entering the king's inner palace.

(4) "Again, the secret deliberations of the king's inner palace have spread to others. ${ }^{2045}$ The king thinks: 'No one else has entered here except the monk. Could this be the monk's work?' This is the fourth danger in entering the king's inner palace.
(5) "Again, in the king's inner palace a father longs for his son, or a son longs for his father. ${ }^{2046}$ They think: 'No one else has entered here except the monk. Could this be the monk's work?' This is the fifth danger in entering the king's inner palace.

(6) "Again, the king promotes someone. Those who are upset by this think: 'The king has close ties with the monk. Could this be the monk's work?' This is the sixth danger in entering the king's inner palace.

(7) "Again, the king demotes someone. Those who are upset by this think: 'The king has close ties with the monk. Could this be the monk's work?' This is the seventh danger in entering the king's inner palace.

(8) "Again, the king dispatches his army at an improper time. Those who are upset by this think: 'The king has close ties with the monk. Could this be the monk's work?' This is the eighth danger in entering the king's inner palace.

(9) "Again, after dispatching his army at a proper time, the king orders it to turn back while en route. Those who are upset by this think: [83] 'The king has close ties with the monk. Could this be the monk's work?' This is the ninth danger in entering the king's inner palace.

(10) "Again, in the king's inner palace there is the trampling of elephants, ${ }^{2047}$ horses, and chariots, as well as tantalizing forms, sounds, odors, tastes, and tactile objects that are not suitable for a monk. This is the tenth danger in entering the king's inner palace.

"These, bhikkhus, are the ten dangers in entering the king's inner palace."

# 46 (6) Sakyans

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Park. Then, on the uposatha day, a number of Sakyan lay followers approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to them:

"Sakyans, do you observe the uposatha complete in eight factors?"2048

"Sometimes we do, Bhante, and sometimes we don't."

"It is your misfortune and loss, Sakyans! When life is endangered by sorrow and death, you observe the uposatha
complete in eight factors [only] sometimes, and sometimes you don't. What do you think, Sakyans? Suppose there was a man here who, without doing anything unwholesome, would earn half a kahäpana daily for his work. [84] Would that suffice for calling him a clever and enterprising man?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"What do you think, Sakyans? Suppose there was a man here who, without doing anything unwholesome, would earn a kahäpana daily for his work. Would that suffice for calling him a clever and enterprising man?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"What do you think, Sakyans? Suppose there was a man here who, without doing anything unwholesome, would earn two kahāpanas ... three ... four ... five ... six ... seven ... eight ... nine . . . ten . . . twenty . . thirty . . forty . . fifty kahāpanas ${ }^{2049}$ daily for his work. Would that suffice for calling him a clever and enterprising man?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"What do you think, Sakyans? If he earns a hundred or a thousand kahāpanas day after day, deposits whatever he gains, and has a life span of a hundred years, living a hundred years, would he acquire a great mass of wealth?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"What do you think, Sakyans? On account of his wealth, because of his wealth, by reason of his wealth, could that man experience exclusively happiness for one night or one day, or for half a night or half a day?"

"No, Bhante. Why not? Because sensual pleasures are impermanent, empty, false, and deceptive."

"However, Sakyans, my disciple who dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute for ten years, practicing as I instruct him, might experience exclusively happiness for a hundred years, ten thousand years, ${ }^{2050}$ [85] a hundred thousand years, and ten million years. ${ }^{2051}$ And he might be a once-returner, a nonreturner, or surely a stream-enterer.

"Let alone ten years, Sakyans. My disciple who dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute for nine years . . . eight years . . . seven years...six years...five years...four years...three years...two years...one year, practicing as I instruct him, might experience
exclusively happiness for a hundred years, ten thousand years, a hundred thousand years, and ten million years. And he might be a once-returner, a non-returner, or surely a stream-enterer.

"Let alone one year, Sakyans. My disciple who dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute for ten months, practicing as I instruct him, might experience exclusively happiness for a hundred years, ten thousand years, a hundred thousand years, and ten million years. And he might be a once-returner, a non-returner, or surely a stream-enterer.

"Let alone ten months, Sakyans. My disciple who dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute for nine months ... eight months ...seven months ... six months ... five months ... four months ... three months ...two months ... one month ... half a month, practicing as I instruct him, might experience exclusively happiness for a hundred years, ten thousand years, a hundred thousand years, and ten million years. And he might be a once-returner, a non-returner, or surely a stream-enterer.

"Let alone half a month, Sakyans. My disciple who dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute for ten nights and days, practicing as I instruct him, might experience exclusively happiness for a hundred years, ten thousand years, a hundred thousand years, and ten million years. And he might be a once-returner, a non-returner, or surely a stream-enterer.

"Let alone ten nights and days, Sakyans. My disciple who dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute for nine nights and days . . . eight nights and days . . . seven nights and days . . . [86] six nights and days ...five nights and days ... four nights and days ... three nights and days ... two nights and days ... one night and day, practicing as I instruct him, might experience exclusively happiness for a hundred years, ten thousand years, a hundred thousand years, and ten million years. And he might be a oncereturner, a non-returner, or surely a stream-enterer.

"It is your misfortune and loss, Sakyans! When life is endangered by sorrow and death, you observe the uposatha complete in eight factors [only] sometimes, and sometimes you don't."

"From today on, Bhante, we will observe the uposatha complete in eight factors."

# 47 (7) Mahāli

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then Mahāli the Licchavi approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, what is the cause and condition for the doing of bad kamma, for the occurrence of bad kamma?"2052

"Mahāli, (1) greed is a cause and condition for the doing of bad kamma, for the occurrence of bad kamma. (2) Hatred is a cause and condition...(3) Delusion is a cause and condition ...(4) Careless attention is a cause [87] and condition ... (5) A wrongly directed mind is a cause and condition for the doing of bad kamma, for the occurrence of bad kamma. This is the cause and condition for the doing of bad kamma, for the occurrence of bad kamma."

"Bhante, what is the cause and condition for the doing of good kamma, for the occurrence of good kamma?"

"Mahāli, (6) non-greed is a cause and condition for the doing of good kamma, for the occurrence of good kamma. (7) Nonhatred is a cause and condition...(8) Non-delusion is a cause and condition ...(9) Careful attention is a cause and condition ...(10) A rightly directed mind is a cause and condition for the doing of good kamma, for the occurrence of good kamma. This is the cause and condition for the doing of good kamma, for the occurrence of good kamma.

"If, Mahāli, these ten qualities did not exist in the world, unrighteous conduct, conduct contrary to the Dhamma, and righteous conduct, conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, would not be seen. But because these ten qualities exist in the world, unrighteous conduct, conduct contrary to the Dhamma, and righteous conduct, conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, are seen."

## 48 (8) Things

"Bhikkhus, there are these ten things that one who has gone forth should often reflect upon. What ten?

(1) "One who has gone forth should often reflect: 'I have entered upon a classless condition. ${ }^{\prime 2053}$

(2) "One who has gone forth should often reflect: 'My living is dependent upon others. ${ }^{\prime 2054}$ [88]
(3) "One who has gone forth should often reflect: 'My deportment should be different. ${ }^{2055}$

(4) "One who has gone forth should often reflect: 'Do I reproach myself in regard to virtuous behavior? ${ }^{2056}$

(5) "One who has gone forth should often reflect: 'Do my wise fellow monks, having investigated, reproach me in regard to virtuous behavior?'

(6) "One who has gone forth should often reflect: 'I must be parted and separated from everyone and everything dear and agreeable to me. ${ }^{2057}$

(7) "One who has gone forth should often reflect: 'I am the owner of my kamma, the heir of my kamma; I have kamma as my origin, kamma as my relative, kamma as my resort; I will be the heir of whatever kamma, good or bad, that I do.'

(8) "One who has gone forth should often reflect: 'How am I spending my nights and days?'

(9) "One who has gone forth should often reflect: 'Do I take delight in empty huts?'

(10) "One who has gone forth should often reflect: 'Have I attained any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, so that in my last days, when I am questioned by my fellow monks, I will not be embarrassed?'

"These, bhikkhus, are the ten things that one who has gone forth should often reflect upon."

49 (9) Subsisting through the Body

"Bhikkhus, these ten things subsist through the body. What ten? Cold, heat, hunger, thirst, defecation, urination, bodily restraint, verbal restraint, restraint in one's livelihood, and the formative activity of existence that leads to renewed existence. ${ }^{2058}$ These ten things subsist through the body."

# 50 (10) Arguments

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park: Now on that occasion, [89] after their meal, on returning from their alms round, a number of bhikkhus assembled in the assembly hall and were sitting together when they took to arguing and quarreling and fell into a dispute, stabbing each other with piercing words.

Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion
and went to the assembly hall, where he sat down on the prepared seat. The Blessed One then addressed the bhikkhus:

"Bhikkhus, what discussion were you engaged in just now as you were sitting together here? What was the conversation that was underway?"

"Here, Bhante, after our meal, on returning from our alms round, we assembled in the assembly hall and were sitting together when we took to arguing and quarreling and fell into a dispute, stabbing each other with piercing words."

"Bhikkhus, it is not suitable for you clansmen who have gone forth out of faith from the household life into homelessness to take to arguing and quarreling and to fall into a dispute, stabbing each other with piercing words.

"There are, bhikkhus, these ten principles of cordiality that create affection and respect and conduce to cohesiveness, to non-dispute, to concord, and to unity. ${ }^{3399}$ What ten?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. Since a bhikkhu is virtuous . . . this is a principle of cordiality that creates affection and respect and conduces to cohesiveness, to non-dispute, to concord, and to unity.

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and accumulates what he has learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life-such teachings as these he has learned much of, retained in mind, recited verbally, [90] investigated mentally, and penetrated well by view. Since a bhikkhu has learned much . . . this is a principle of cordiality that creates affection and respect and conduces . . . to unity.

(3) "Again, a bhikkhu has good friends, good companions, good comrades. Since a bhikkhu has good friends . . . this is a principle of cordiality that creates affection and respect and conduces . . . to unity.

(4) "Again, a bhikkhu is easy to correct and possesses qualities that make him easy to correct; he is patient and receives instruction respectfully. Since a bhikkhu is easy to correct . . .
this is a principle of cordiality that creates affection and respect and conduces . . . to unity.

(5) "Again, a bhikkhu is skillful and diligent in attending to the diverse chores that are to be done for his fellow monks; he possesses appropriate investigation there, and he is able to carry out and arrange everything properly. Since a bhikkhu is skillful and diligent...this is a principle of cordiality that creates affection and respect and conduces ... to unity.

(6) "Again, a bhikkhu loves the Dhamma and is pleasing in his assertions, filled with a lofty joy pertaining to the Dhamma and discipline. Since a bhikkhu loves the Dhamma . . . this is a principle of cordiality that creates affection and respect and conduces . . . to unity.

(7) "Again, a bhikkhu has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities. Since a bhikkhu has aroused energy ... [91]...this is a principle of cordiality that creates affection and respect and conduces ... to unity.

(8) "Again, a bhikkhu is content with any kind of robe, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick. Since a bhikkhu is content with any kind of robe ... this is a principle of cordiality that creates affection and respect and conduces ... to unity.

(9) "Again, a bhikkhu is mindful, possessing supreme mindfulness and alertness, one who remembers and recollects what was done and said long ago. Since a bhikkhu is mindful ... this is a principle of cordiality that creates affection and respect and conduces . . . to unity.

(10) "Again, a bhikkhu is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. Since a bhikkhu is wise . . . this is a principle of cordiality that creates affection and respect and conduces ... to unity.

"These, bhikkhus, are the ten principles of cordiality that create affection and respect and conduce to cohesiveness, to non-dispute, to concord, and to unity." [92]

# The Second Fifty

## I. One's Own Mind

## 51 (1) One's Own Mind

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who is not skilled in the ways of others' minds [should train]: 'I will be skilled in the ways of my own mind.' It is in this way that you should train yourselves.

"And how is a bhikkhu skilled in the ways of his own mind? It is just as if a woman or a man-young, youthful, and fond of ornaments-would look at her or his own facial reflection in a clean bright mirror or in a bowl of clear water. If they see any dust or blemish there, they will make an effort to remove it. But if they do not see any dust or blemish there, they will be glad about it; and their wish fulfilled, they will think, 'How fortunate that I'm clean! ${ }^{\prime 2060}$ So too, self-examination is very helpful for a bhikkhu [to grow] in wholesome qualities.

"[One should ask oneself:] (1) 'Am I often given to longing [93] or without longing? (2) Am I often given to ill will or without ill will? (3) Am I often overcome by dullness and drowsiness or free from dullness and drowsiness? (4) Am I often restless or calm? (5) Am I often plagued by doubt or free from doubt? (6) Am I often angry or without anger? (7) Is my mind often defiled or undefiled? (8) Is my body often agitated or unagitated? (9) Am I often lazy or energetic? (10) Am I often unconcentrated or concentrated? ${ }^{\prime 2061}$

"If, by such self-examination, a bhikkhu knows: 'I am often given to longing, given to ill will, overcome by dullness and drowsiness, restless, plagued by doubt, angry, defiled in mind, agitated in body, lazy, and unconcentrated,' he should put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to abandon those same bad unwholesome qualities. Just as one whose clothes or head had caught fire would put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear com-
prehension to extinguish [the fire on] his clothes or head, so too that bhikkhu should put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to abandon those same bad unwholesome qualities. [94]

"But if, by such self-examination, a bhikkhu knows: 'I am often without longing, without ill will, free from dullness and drowsiness, calm, free from doubt, without anger, undefiled in mind, unagitated in body, energetic, and concentrated,' he should base himself on those same wholesome qualities and make a further effort to reach the destruction of the taints."

# 52 (2) Säriputta

There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend!" those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:

[Identical with 10:51, but spoken by Sāriputta.] [95-96]

## 53 (3) Standstill

"Bhikkhus, I do not praise even a standstill in wholesome qualities, much less decline. I praise only growth in wholesome qualities, not a standstill or deterioration. ${ }^{2062}$.

"And how is there deterioration-not a standstill or growthin wholesome qualities? Here, a bhikkhu has a certain degree of faith, virtuous behavior, learning, renunciation, wisdom, and discernment. Those qualities of his do not remain the same or increase. This, I say, is deterioration rather than a standstill or growth in wholesome qualities. Thus there is deteriorationnot a standstill or growth-in wholesome qualities.

"And how is there a standstill-not deterioration or growthin wholesome qualities? Here, a bhikkhu has a certain degree of faith, virtuous behavior, learning, renunciation, wisdom, and discernment.

"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who is not skilled in the ways of others' minds [should train]: 'I will be skilled in the ways of my own mind.' ... [97-98] ... [as in 10:51 down to:] ... But if, by such self-examination, a bhikkhu knows: 'I am often without longing ... and concentrated,' then he should base himself on those same wholesome qualities and make a further effort to reach the destruction of the taints."

# 54 (4) Serenity

"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who is not skilled in the ways of others' minds [should train]: 'I will be skilled in the ways of my own mind.' It is in this way that you should train yourselves.

"And how is a bhikkhu skilled in the ways of his own mind?

If they see any dust or blemish there, they will make an effort to remove it. But if they do not see any dust or blemish there, they will be glad about it, [99] and their wish fulfilled, they will think, 'How fortunate for me that I'm clean!'

"So too, bhikkhus, self-examination is very helpful for a bhikkhu [to grow] in wholesome qualities: ${ }^{2063}$ 'Do I gain internal serenity of mind or not? Do I gain the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena or not?'

(1) "If, by such self-examination, a bhikkhu knows: 'I gain internal serenity of mind but not the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena,' he should base himself on internal serenity of mind and make an effort to gain the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena. Then, some time later, he gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena.

(2) "But if, by such self-examination, he knows: 'I gain the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena but not internal serenity of mind,' he should base himself on the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena and make an effort to gain internal serenity of mind. Then, some time later, he gains both the
higher wisdom of insight into phenomena and internal serenity of mind.

(3) "But if, by such self-examination, he knows: 'I gain neither internal serenity of mind nor the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena,' he should put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to obtain both those wholesome qualities. Just as one whose clothes or head had caught fire would put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to extinguish [the fire on] his clothes or head, so that bhikkhu should put forth extraordinary desire, [100] effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to obtain both those wholesome qualities. Then, some time later, he gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena.

(4) "But if, by such self-examination, he knows: 'I gain both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena,' he should base himself on those same wholesome qualities and make a further effort to reach the destruction of the taints.

"Robes, I say, are twofold: to be used and those not to be used. ${ }^{2064}$ Almsfood too, I say, is twofold: that to be used and that not to be used. Lodgings too, I say, are twofold: those to be used and those not to be used. Villages or towns too, I say, are twofold: those to be resorted to and those not to be resorted to. Countries or regions too, I say, are twofold: those to be resorted to and those not to be resorted to. Persons too, I say, are twofold: those to be associated with and those not to be associated with.

(5) "When it was said: 'Robes, I say, are twofold: those to be used and those not to be used,' for what reason was this said? If one knows of a robe: 'When I use this robe, unwholesome qualities increase in me and wholesome qualities decline,' one should not use such a robe. But if one knows of a robe: 'When I use this robe, unwholesome qualities decline in me and wholesome qualities increase,' one should use such a robe. When it was said: 'Robes, I say, are twofold: to be used and not to be used,' it is because of this that this was said.

(6) "When it was said: 'Almsfood too, I say, is twofold: that to
be used and that not to be used,' for what reason was this said? If one knows of some almsfood: 'When I use this almsfood, unwholesome qualities increase in me and wholesome [101] qualities decline,' one should not use such almsfood. But if one knows of some almsfood: 'When I use this almsfood, unwholesome qualities decline in me and wholesome qualities increase,' one should use such almsfood.

# 55 (5) Decline

There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend!" those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:

"Friends, it is said: 'A person subject to decline, a person subject to decline.' In what way has the Blessed One said that a person is subject to decline, and in what way that a person is not subject to decline?"

"We would come from far away, friend, to learn the meaning of this statement from the Venerable Sāriputta. It would be good if he would clear up the meaning of this statement: [103] Having heard it from him, the bhikkhus will retain it in mind."

"Well then, friends, listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, friend," those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:

"In what way, friends, has the Blessed One said that a person is subject to decline? Here, a bhikkhu does not get to hear a teaching he has not heard before, forgets those teachings he has already heard, does not bring to mind those teachings with which he is already familiar, and does not understand what he has not understood. It is in this way that the Blessed One has said a person is subject to decline. ${ }^{2065}$

"And in what way, friends, has the Blessed One said that a

"Friends, a bhikkhu who is not skilled in the ways of others' minds [should train]: 'I will be skilled in the ways of my own mind.' It is in this way that you should train yourselves.

"And how, friends, is a bhikkhu skilled in the ways of his own mind? It is just as if a woman or a man-young, youthful, and fond of ornaments-would look at her or his own facial reflection in a clean and bright mirror or in a bowl of clear water. If they see any dust or blemish there, they will make an effort to remove it. But if they do not see any dust or blemish there, they will be glad about it; [104] and their wish fulfilled, they will think, 'How fortunate for me that I'm clean!' So too, selfexamination is very helpful for a bhikkhu [to grow] in wholesome qualities.

"[One should ask oneself:] (1) 'Am I often without longing? Does this quality exist in me or not? (2) Am I often without ill will? Does this quality exist in me or not?

"If, by such self-examination, a bhikkhu does not see any of these wholesome qualities present in himself, then he should put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to obtain those wholesome qualities. Just as one whose clothes or head had caught fire would put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to extinguish [the fire on] his clothes or head, so that bhikkhu should put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal,
enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to obtain those wholesome qualities.

"But if, by such self-examination, a bhikkhu sees some wholesome qualities present in himself but not others, [105] he should base himself on those wholesome qualities that he sees in himself and put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal; enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to obtain those wholesome qualities that he does not see in himself. Just as one whose clothes or head had caught fire would put forth extraordinary desire ...to extinguish [the fire on] his clothes or head, so that bhikkhu should base himself on the wholesome qualities that he sees in himself and put forth extraordinary desire ...to obtain those wholesome qualities that he does not see in himself.

"But if, by such self-examination, a bhikkhu sees all these wholesome qualities present in himself, he should base himself on those same wholesome qualities and make a further effort to reach the destruction of the taints."

# 56 (6) Perceptions (1)

"Bhikkhus, these ten perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are of great fruit and benefit, culminating in the deathless, having the deathless as their consummation. ${ }^{2066}$ What ten? (1) The perception of unattractiveness, (2) the perception of death, (3) the perception of the repulsiveness of food, (4) the perception of non-delight in the entire world, (5) the perception of impermanence, (6) the perception of suffering in the impermanent, (7) the perception of non-self in what is suffering, (8) the perception of abandoning, (9) the perception of dispassion, and (10) the perception of cessation. These ten perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are of great fruit and benefit, culminating in the deathless, having the deathless as their consummation." [106]

## 57 (7) Perceptions (2)

"Bhikkhus, these ten perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are of great fruit and benefit, culminating in the deathless, having the deathless as their consummation. What ten? (1) The perception of impermanence, (2) the perception of non-self, (3) the perception of death, (4) the perception of the repulsiveness of food, (5) the perception of non-delight in the
entire world, (6) the perception of a skeleton, (7) the perception of a worm-infested corpse, (8) the perception of a livid corpse, (9) the perception of a fissured corpse, and (10) the perception of a bloated corpse. ${ }^{2067}$ These ten perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are of great fruit and benefit, culminating in the deathless, having the deathless as their consummation."

# 58 (8) Roots

"Bhikkhus, wanderers of other sects may ask you: (1) 'In what, friends, are all things rooted? (2) Through what do they come into being? (3) From what do they originate? (4) Upon what do they converge? (5) By what are they headed? (6) What exercises authority over them? (7) What is their supervisor? (8) What is their core? (9) In what do they culminate? (10) What is their consummation?' If you are asked thus, how would you answer them? ${ }^{\prime 2068}$

"Bhante, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the Blessed One, take recourse in the Blessed One. It would be good if the Blessed One would clear up the meaning of this statement. Having heard it from him, the bhikkhus will retain it in mind."

"Then listen, bhikkhus, and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, if wanderers of other sects should ask you: 'What, friends, are all things rooted in? ... [107] ... What is their consummation?' you should answer them as follows.

"Friends, (1) all things are rooted in desire. (2) They come into being through attention. (3) They originate from contact. (4) They converge upon feeling. (5) They are headed by concentration. (6) Mindfulness exercises authority over them. (7) Wisdom is their supervisor. (8) Liberation is their core. (9) They culminate in the deathless. (10) Their consummation is nibbāna. ${ }^{\prime 2069}$

"If you are asked thus, bhikkhus, it is in such a way that you should answer those wanderers of other sects."

## 59 (9) Going Forth

"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'Our minds will be strengthened in accordance with [the spirit of]
our going forth, and arisen bad unwholesome qualities will not obsess our minds. ${ }^{2070}$ (1) Our minds will be strengthened in the perception of impermanence. (2) Our minds will be strengthened in the perception of non-self. (3) Our minds will be strengthened in the perception of unattractiveness. (4) Our minds will be strengthened in the perception of danger. (5) We will know the even and uneven ways of the world, ${ }^{2071}$ and our minds will be strengthened in this perception. (6) We will know the coming into being and extermination of the world, ${ }^{2072}$ and our minds will be strengthened in this perception. (7) We will know the origination and passing away of the world, and our minds will be strengthened in this perception. (8) Our minds will be strengthened in the perception of abandoning. (9) Our minds will be strengthened in the perception of dispassion. (10) Our minds will be strengthened in the perception of cessation. ${ }^{2073}$ [108] It is in such a way that you should you train yourselves.

"When a bhikkhu's mind has been strengthened in accordance with [the spirit of] his going forth, and arisen bad unwholesome qualities do not obsess his mind-when his mind has been strengthened in the perception of impermanence . . . when his mind has been' strengthened in the perception of cessation-one of two fruits is to be expected for him: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue remaining, the state of non-returning."

# 60 (10) Girimananda

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Now on that occasion the Venerable Girimānanda was sick, afflicted, and gravely ill. ${ }^{2074}$ Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, the Venerable Girimānanda is sick, afflicted, and gravely ill. It would be good if the Blessed One would visit him out of compassion."

"If, Ānanda, you visit the bhikkhu Girimānanda and speak to him about ten perceptions, it is possible that on hearing about them his affliction will immediately subside. What are the ten? [109]

"(1) The perception of impermanence, (2) the perception of
non-self, (3) the perception of unattractiveness, (4) the perception of danger, (5) the perception of abandoning, (6) the perception of dispassion, (7) the perception of cessation, (8) the perception of non-delight in the entire world, (9) the perception of impermanence in all conditioned phenomena, and (10) mindfulness of breathing.

(1) "And what, Ānanda, is the perception of impermanence? Here, having gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'Form is impermanent, feeling is impermanent, perception is impermanent, volitional activities are impermanent, consciousness is impermanent.' Thus he dwells contemplating impermanence in these five aggregates subject to clinging. This is called the perception of impermanence.

(2) "And what, Ānanda, is the perception of non-self? Here, having gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'The eye is non-self, forms are nonself; the ear is non-self, sounds are non-self; the nose is non-self, odors are non-self; the tongue is non-self, tastes are non-self; the body is non-self, tactile objects are non-self; the mind is non-self, mental phenomena are non-self.' Thus he dwells contemplating non-self in these six internal and external sense bases. This is called the perception of non-self.

(3) "And what, Ānanda, is the perception of unattractiveness? Here, a bhikkhu reviews this very body upward from the soles of the feet and downward from the tips of the hairs, enclosed in skin, as full of many kinds of impurities: 'There are in this body hair of the head, hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach, excrement, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, fluid of the joints, urine.' Thus he dwells contemplating unattractiveness in this body. This is called the perception of unattractiveness.

(4) "And what, Ānanda, is the perception of danger? Here, having gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'This body is the source of much pain [110] and danger; for all sorts of afflictions arise in this body, that is, eye-disease, disease of the inner ear, nose-disease, tonguedisease, body-disease, head-disease, disease of the external ear, mouth-disease, tooth-disease, ${ }^{2075}$ cough, asthma, catarrh,
pyrexia, fever, stomach ache, fainting, dysentery, gripes, cholera, leprosy, boils, eczema, tuberculosis, epilepsy, ringworm, itch, scab, chickenpox, scabies, hemorrhage, diabetes, hemorrhoids, cancer, fistula; illnesses originating from bile, phlegm, wind, or their combination; illnesses produced by change of climate; illnesses produced by careless behavior; illnesses produced by assault; or illnesses produced as the result of kamma; and cold, heat, hunger, thirst, defecation, and urination.' Thus he dwells contemplating danger in this body. This is called the perception of danger.

(5) "And what, Ānanda, is the perception of abandoning? Here, a bhikkhu does not tolerate an arisen sensual thought; he abandons it, dispels it, terminates it, and obliterates it. He does not tolerate an arisen thought of ill will ... an arisen thought of harming . . .bad unwholesome states whenever they arise; he abandons them, dispels them, terminates them, and obliterates them. This is called the perception of abandoning.

(6) "And what, Ānanda, is the perception of dispassion? Here, having gone to the forest, to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, the stilling of all activities, the relinquishment of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, dispassion, nibbāna.' This is called the perception of dispassion. ${ }^{2076}$

(7) "And what, Ānanda, is the perception of cessation? Here, having gone to the forest, to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'This is peaceful, [111] this is sublime, that is, the stilling of all activities, the relinquishment of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, cessation, nibbāna.' This is called the perception of cessation.

(8) "And what, Ānanda, is the perception of non-delight in the entire world? Here, a bhikkhu refrains from ${ }^{2077}$ any engagement and clinging, mental standpoints, adherences, and underlying tendencies in regard to the world, abandoning them without clinging to them. This is called the perception of non-delight in the entire world.

(9) "And what, Ānanda, is the perception of impermanence in all conditioned phenomena? Here, a bhikkhu is repelled, humiliated, and disgusted by all conditioned phenomena. This is called the perception of impermanence in all conditioned phenomena. ${ }^{2078}$
(10) "And what, Ānanda, is mindfulness of breathing? Here, a bhikkhu, having gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, sits down. Having folded his legs crosswise, straightened his body, and established mindfulness in front of him, just mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out.

"Breathing in long, he knows: 'I breathe in long'; or breathing out long, he knows: 'I breathe out long.' Breathing in short, he knows: 'I breathe in short'; or breathing out short, he knows: 'I breathe out short.' He trains thus: 'Experiencing the whole body, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Experiencing the whole body, I will breathe out.' He trains thus: 'Tranquilizing the bodily activity, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Tranquilizing the bodily activity, I will breathe out.'

"He trains thus: 'Experiencing rapture, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Experiencing rapture, I will breathe out.' He trains thus: 'Experiencing happiness, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Experiencing happiness, I will breathe out.' He trains thus: 'Experiencing the mental activity, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Experiencing the mental activity, I will breathe out.' He trains thus: 'Tranquilizing the mental activity, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Tranquilizing the mental activity, I will breathe out. ${ }^{2079}$

"He trains thus: 'Experiencing the mind, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Experiencing the mind, I will breathe out.' [112] He trains thus: 'Gladdening the mind, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Gladdening the mind, I will breathe out.' He trains thus: 'Concentrating the mind, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Concentrating the mind, I will breathe out.' He trains thus: 'Liberating the mind, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Liberating the mind, I will breathe out. ${ }^{2080}$

"He trains thus: 'Contemplating impermanence, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Contemplating impermanence, I will breathe out.' He trains thus: 'Contemplating fading away, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Contemplating fading away, I will breathe out.' He trains thus: 'Contemplating cessation, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Contemplating cessation, I will breathe out.' He trains thus: 'Contemplating relinquishment, I will breathe in'; he trains thus: 'Contemplating relinquishment, I will breathe out.'

"This is called mindfulness of breathing.
"If, Ānanda, you visit the bhikkhu Girimānanda and speak to him about these ten perceptions, it is possible that on hearing about them he will immediately recover from his affliction."

Then, when the Venerable Ānanda had learned these ten perceptions from the Blessed One, he went to the Venerable Girimānanda and spoke to him about them. When the Venerable Girimānanda heard about these ten perceptions, his affliction immediately subsided. The Venerable Girimānanda recovered from that affliction, and that is how he was cured of his affliction. [113]

# II. PAIRS

61 (1) Ignorance

"Bhikkhus, this is said: 'A first point of ignorance, bhikkhus, is not seen such that before this there was no ignorance and afterward it came into being. ${ }^{\prime 2981}$ Still, ignorance is seen to have a specific condition.

"I say, bhikkhus, that ignorance has a nutriment; ${ }^{2082}$ it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for ignorance? It should be said: the five hindrances. The five hindrances, too, I say, have a nutriment; they are not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for the five hindrances? It should be said: the three kinds of misconduct. The three kinds of misconduct, too, I say, have a nutriment; they are not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for the three kinds of misconduct? It should be said: non-restraint of the sense faculties. Nonrestraint of the sense faculties, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for nonrestraint of the sense faculties? It should be said: lack of mindfulness and clear comprehension. Lack of mindfulness and clear comprehension, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for lack of mindfulness and clear comprehension? It should be said: careless attention. Careless attention, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for careless attention? It should be said: lack of faith. Lack of faith, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for lack of faith? It should be said: not hearing the good Dhamma. Not hearing the good Dhamma, too, I say, has a nutriment; it
is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for not hearing the good Dhamma? It should be said: not associating with good persons. ${ }^{3893}$

"Thus not associating with good persons, becoming full, fills up not hearing the good Dhamma. Not hearing the good Dhamma, becoming full, fills up lack of faith. Lack of faith, becoming full, fills up careless attention. Careless attention, becoming full, fills up lack of mindfulness and clear comprehension. Lack of mindfulness and clear comprehension, becoming full, [114] fills up non-restraint of the sense faculties. Non-restraint of the sense faculties, becoming full, fills up the three kinds of misconduct. The three kinds of misconduct, becoming full, fill up the five hindrances. The five hindrances, becoming full, fill up ignorance. Thus there is nutriment for ignorance, and in this way it becomes full.

"Just as, when it is raining and the rain pours down in thick droplets on a mountaintop, the water flows down along the slope and fills the clefts, gullies, and creeks; these, becoming full, fill up the pools; these, becoming full, fill up the lakes; these, becoming full, fill up the streams; these, becoming full, fill up the rivers; and these, becoming full, fill up the great ocean; thus there is nutriment for the great ocean, and in this way it becomes full. So too, not associating with good persons, becoming full, fills up not hearing the good Dhamma.... The five hindrances, becoming full, fill up ignorance. Thus there is nutriment for ignorance, and in this way it becomes full.

"I say, bhikkhus, that (1) true knowledge and liberation have a nutriment; they are not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for true knowledge and liberation? It should be said: (2) the seven factors of enlightenment. The seven factors of enlightenment, too, I say, have a nutriment; they are not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for the seven factors of enlightenment? It should'be said: (3) the four establishments of mindfulness. The four establishments of mindfulness, too, I say, have a nutriment; they are not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for the four establishments of mindfulness? It should be said: (4) the three kinds of good conduct. [115] The three kinds of good conduct, too, I say, have a nutriment; they are not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for the three kinds of good conduct? It should be said: (5) restraint
of the sense faculties. Restraint of the sense faculties, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for restraint of the sense faculties? It should be said: (6) mindfulness and clear comprehension. Mindfulness and clear comprehension, too, I say, have a nutriment; they are not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for mindfulness and clear comprehension? It should be said: (7) careful attention. Careful attention, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for careful attention? It should be said: (8) faith. Faith, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And, what is the nutriment for faith? It should be said: (9) hearing the good Dhamma. Hearing the good Dhamma, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for hearing the good Dhamma? It should be said: (10) associating with good persons.

"Thus associating with good persons, becoming full; fills up hearing the good Dhamma. Hearing the good Dhamma, becoming full, fills up faith. Faith, becoming full, fills up careful attention. Careful attention, becoming full, fills up mindfulness and clear comprehension. Mindfulness and clear comprehension, becoming full, fill up restraint of the sense faculties. Restraint of the sense faculties, becoming full, fills up the three kinds of good conduct. The three kinds of good conduct, becoming full, fill up the four establishments of mindfulness. The four establishments of mindfulness, becoming full, fill up the seven factors of enlightenment. The seven factors of enlightenment, becoming full, fill up true knowledge and liberation. Thus there is nutriment for true knowledge and liberation, and in this way they become full.

"Just as, when it is raining and the rain pours down in thick droplets on a mountaintop, the water flows down along the slope and fills the clefts, gullies, and creeks; these, becoming full, fill up the pools; these, becoming full, fill up the lakes; these, becoming full, fill up the streams; these, becoming full, fill up the rivers; and these, becoming full, [116] fill up the great ocean; thus there is nutriment for the great ocean, and in this way it becomes full.

# 63 (3) Certainty

"Bhikkhus, all those who have reached certainty about me are. accomplished in view. Of those accomplished in view, five gain the goal here in this world; ${ }^{2084}$ five gain the goal having left this world.

"Who are the five that gain the goal here in this world? [120] The seven-times-at-most attainer, the family-to-family attainer, the one-seed attainer, ${ }^{2085}$ the once-returner, and one who, in this very life, is an arahant. These five gain the goal in this world.

"Who are the five that gain the goal having left this world?

"All those, bhikkhus, who have reached certainty about me are accomplished in view. Of those accomplished in view, the former five gain the goal here in this world; the latter five gain the goal having left this world."

## 64 (4) Unwavering

65 (5) Happiness (1).

On one occasion the Venerable Sāriputta was dwelling among the Magadhans at Nālakagāmaka. Then the wanderer Sāmaṇ̣akāni [121] approached the Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Sāriputta:

"Friend Sāriputta, what is happiness? What is suffering?"

"Rebirth, friend, is suffering. No rebirth is happiness. When there is rebirth, this suffering is to be expected: cold, heat, hunger, thirst, defecation, and urination; being afflicted by fire, sticks, or knives; and relatives and friends get together and scold one. When there is rebirth, this suffering is to be expected.

"When there is no rebirth, this happiness is to be expected: no cold, no heat, no hunger, no thirst, no defecation, and no urination; no being afflicted by fire, sticks, or knives; and relatives and friends don't get together and scold one. When there is no rebirth, this happiness is to be expected."

66 (6) Happiness (2)

On one occasion the VenerableSāriputta was dwelling among the Magadhans at Nālakagāmaka. Then the wanderer Sāmaṇ̣̣akāni approached the Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side [122] and said to the Venerable Sāriputta:

"Friend Sāriputta, what is happiness in this Dhamma and discipline, and what is suffering?"

"Dissatisfaction, friend, is suffering in this Dhamma and dis-
cipline. Enjoyment is happiness. When there is dissatisfaction, this suffering is to be expected. (1) When walking, one does not find happiness or comfort. (2) When standing still ... (3) When sitting ... (4) When lying down ... (5) When in the village ... (6) When in the forest ... (7) When at the foot of a tree ... (8) When in an empty hut ... (9) When in the open air ... (10) When amid the bhikkhus, one does not find happiness or comfort. When there is dissatisfaction, this suffering is to be expected.

# 67 (7) Nalakapāna (1)

On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Sangha of bhikkhus when he reached the Kosalan town named Nalakapāna. There at Nalakapāna the Blessed One dwelled in a Judas tree grove. Now on that occasion, on the day of the uposatha, the Blessed One was sitting surrounded by the Sangha of bhikkhus. Having instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened the Sangha of bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk for much of the night, and having surveyed the utterly silent Sangha of bhikkhus, the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Sāriputta: "The Sangha of bhikkhus is free from dullness and drowsiness, Sāriputta. Give a [123] Dhamma talk to the bhikkhus. My back is aching, so I will stretch it."

"Yes, Bhante," the Venerable Sāriputta replied.

Then the Blessed One folded his outer robe in four and lay down on his right side in the lion's posture, with one foot overlapping the other, mindful and clearly comprehending, after noting in his mind the idea of rising. The Venerable Sāriputta then addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend!" those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:

"Friends, for one who does not have faith in [cultivating]
wholesome qualities, who does not have a sense of moral shame ... who does not have moral dread ... who does not have energy ... who does not have wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, whether night or day comes, only deterioration and not growth in wholesome qualities is to be expected. Just as, during the dark fortnight, whether night or day comes, the moon only deteriorates in beauty, roundness, and brightness, in diameter and circumference, so too, for one who does not have faith... wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, whether night or day comes, only deterioration and not growth in wholesome qualities is to be expected.

(1) "'A person without faith,' friends: this is a case of decline. (2) 'A morally shameless person' ...(3) 'A morally reckless person' ...(4) 'A lazy person' ...(5) 'An unwise person' ...(6) 'An angry person' ...(7) 'A hostile person' ...(8) 'A person of evil desires' ...(9) 'A person with bad friends' ...(10) 'A person who holds wrong view': this is a case of decline.

69 (9) Topics of Discussion (1)

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇ̣ika's Park. Now on that occasion, after their meal, on returning from their alms round, a number of bhikkhus had assembled in the assembly hall and were sitting together engaging in various kinds of pointless talk, that is: talk about kings, thieves, and ministers of state; talk about armies, perils, and wars; talk about food, drink, garments, and beds; talk about garlands and scents; talk about relatives, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and talk about heroes; street talk and talk by the well; talk about the departed; miscellaneous talk; speculation about the world and the sea; talk about becoming this or that.

Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and went to the assembly hall, where he sat down on the prepared seat. The Blessed One then addressed the bhikkhus:

"Bhikkhus, what discussion were you engaged in just now as you were sitting together here? What was the conversation that was underway?"

"Here, Bhante, after our meal, on returning from our alms round, we assembled in the assembly hall and were sitting together engaging in various kinds of pointless talk, that is: talk about kings, thieves, and ministers of state ... talk about becoming this or that."

"Bhikkhus, it is not suitable for you, [129] clansmen who have gone forth from the household life into homelessness out of faith, to engage in various kinds of pointless talk, that is: talk about kings, thieves, and ministers of state ... talk about becoming this or that.

"There are, bhikkhus, these ten topics of discussion. What ten? Talk on fewness of desires, on contentment, on solitude, on not being bound up with others, on arousing energy, on virtuous behavior, on concentration, on wisdom, on liberation, on knowledge and vision of liberation. These are the ten topics of discussion.

"If, bhikkhus, you engage in discussion on any of these ten
topics, your splendor might surpass even the splendor of the sun and moon, as powerful and mighty as they are, how much more then that of the wanderers of other sects!"

# III. Wish

On one occasion the Blessed. One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, be observant of virtuous behavior and observant of the Pātimokkha. Dwell restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken them, train in the training rules.

(1) "If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I be pleasing and agreeable to my fellow monks, respected and esteemed by them,' let him fulfill virtuous behavior, be devoted to internal serenity of mind, not neglect the jhānas, be possessed of insight, and resort to empty huts.

(2) "If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I gain robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick,' let him fulfill virtuous behavior... and resort to empty huts.

(3) "If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May the services of those whose robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick I use be of great fruit and benefit to them,' let him fulfill virtuous behavior... and resort to empty huts.

(4) "If a bhikkhu should wish: [132] 'When my deceased relatives and family members, after passing away, remember me
with confidence in their minds, may this be of great fruit and benefit to them,' let him fulfill virtuous behavior ... and resort to empty huts.

(5) "If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I be content with any kind of robe, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick,' let him fulfill virtuous behavior . . . and resort to empty huts.

(6) "If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I patiently endiure cold and heat; hunger and thirst; contact with flies, mosquitoes, wind, the burning sun, and serpents; and rude and offensive ways of speech. May I be able to bear up with arisen bodily feelings that are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, harrowing, disagreeable, sapping one's vitality,' let him fulfill virtuous behavior ... and resort to empty huts.

(7) "If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I become one who vanquishes discontent and delight, and may discontent and delight not vanquish me. May I overcome discontent and delight whenever they arise,' let him fulfill virtuous behavior . . . and resort to empty huts.

(8) "If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I become one who vanquishes fear and terror, and may fear and terror not vanquish me. May I overcome fear and terror whenever they arise,' let him fulfill virtuous behavior . . . and resort to empty huts.

(9) "If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life,' let him fulfill virtuous behavior... and resort to empty huts.

(10) "If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I, with the destruction of the taints, realize for myself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, [133] and having entered upon it, dwell in it,' let him fulfill virtuous behavior, be devoted to internal serenity of mind, not neglect the jhānas, be possessed of insight, and resort to empty huts.

"When it was said: 'Bhikkhus, be observant of virtuous behavior and observant of the Pātimokkha; dwell restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults; having undertaken them, train in the training rules,' it is because of this that this was said."

# 72 (2) Thorns

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood together with a number of very well-known elder disciples: the Venerable Cāla, the Venerable Upacāla, the Venerable Kakkata, the Venerable Katimbha, the Venerable Kata, the Venerable Kațissanga, and other very well-known elder disciples.

Now on that occasion a number of very well-known Licchavis had entered the Great Wood in order to see the Blessed One, and as they followed one another in their finest carriages they made an uproar and a racket. It then occurred to those venerable ones: "A number of very well-known Licchavis have entered the Great Wood in order to see the Blessed One, and as they follow one another in their finest carriages they are making an uproar and a racket. Now the Blessed One has called noise a thorn to the jhānas. Let us go to the Gosinga Sal Woods. [134] There we can dwell at ease, without noise and without any crowds." Then those venerable ones went to the Gosinga Sal Woods, where they dwelt at ease, without noise and crowds.

Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, where is Cāla? Where is Upacāla? Where is Kakkata? Where is Katimbha? Where is Kata? Where is Kațissanga? Where have those elder disciples gone?"

"Bhante, it occurred to those venerable ones: 'A number of very well-known Licchavis . . . are making an uproar and a racket. . . . Let us go to the Gosinga Sal Woods, where we can dwell at ease, without noise and crowds.' So they went to the Gosinga Sal Woods, where they dwell at ease, without noise and crowds."

"Good, good, bhikkhus! Those great disciples spoke rightly when they said that I have called noise a thorn to the jhānas. There are, bhikkhus, these ten thorns. What ten? (1) Delight in company is a thorn to one who delights in solitude. (2) Pursuit of an attractive object is a thorn to one intent on meditation on the mark of the unattractive. (3) An unsuitable show is a thorn to one guarding the doors of the sense faculties. (4) Keeping company with women is a thorn to the celibate life. [135] (5) Noise is a thorn to the first jhāna. (6) Thought and examination are a thorn to the second jhāna. (7) Rapture is a thorn to the
third jhāna. (8) In-and-out breathing is a thorn to the fourth jhāna. (9) Perception and feeling are a thorn to the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling. (10) Lust is a thorn, hatred is a thorn, and delusion is a thorn. Dwell thornless, bhikkhus! Dwell without thorns! The arahants are thornless. The arahants are without thorns. The arahants are thornless and without thorns."

# 73 (3) Wished For

"Bhikkhus, there are these ten things that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world. What ten? (1) Wealth is wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world. (2) Beauty ... (3) Health ... (4) Virtuous behavior ... (5) Celibacy ... (6) Friends ... (7) Learning ... (8) Wisdom ... (9) Good qualities ... (10) The heavens are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world. [136] These are the ten things that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world.

"There are ten [other] things, bhikkhus, that are obstructions to these ten things that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world. (1) Indolence and lack of initiative are obstructions to [the acquisition of] wealth. (2) Not adorning and beautifying oneself are obstructions to beauty. (3) Doing what is unbeneficial is an obstruction to health. (4) Bad friendship is an obstruction to virtuous behavior. (5) Nonrestraint of the sense faculties is an obstruction to celibacy. (6) Duplicity is an obstruction to friendships. (7) Non-recitation is an obstruction to learning. (8) Unwillingness to listen and not asking questions are obstructions to wisdom. (9) Not applying oneself and lack of reflection are obstructions to good qualities. (10) Wrong practice is an obstruction to the heavens. These are the ten [other] things that are obstructions to those ten things that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world.

"There are ten [other] things, bhikkhus, that are nutriments for these ten things that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world. (1) Diligence and initiative are nutriments for [the acquisition of] wealth. (2) Adorning and beautifying oneself are nutriments for beauty. (3) Doing what
is beneficial is a nutriment for health. (4) Good friendship is a nutriment for virtuous behavior. (5) Restraint of the sense facultics is a nutriment for celibacy. (6) Sincerity is a nutriment for friendships. (7) Recitation is a nutriment for learning. (8) Willingness to listen and asking questions are nutriments for wisdom. (9) Applying oneself and reflection are nutriments for good qualities. (10) Right practice is a nutriment for the heavens. These are the ten [other] things that are nutriments for those ten things that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world." [137]

# 74 (4) Growth ${ }^{2090}$

"Bhikkhus, growing in ten ways, a noble disciple grows by a noble growth, and he absorbs the essence and the best of this life. What ten? (1) He grows in fields and land; (2) in wealth and grain; (3) in wives and children; (4) in slaves, workers, and servants; (5) in livestock; (6)-(10) in faith, virtuous behavior, learning, generosity, and wisdom. Growing in these ten ways, a noble disciple grows by a noble growth, and he absorbs the essence and the best of this life."

One who grows here in wealth and grain, in children, wives, and livestock, is wealthy and famous, honored by relatives, friends, and royalty.

Such a discerning good manwho grows here in faith and virtuous behavior, in wisdom, generosity, and learninggrows in both ways in this life.

## 75 (5) Migasāla ${ }^{3091}$

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Then, in the morning, the Venerable Ānanda dressed, took his bowl and robe, and went to the house of the female lay follower Migasālā, where he sat down on the seat prepared for him. Then the female lay disciple Migasālā approached the Venerable Ānanda, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:

"Bhante Ānanda, just how should this [138] teaching of the

Blessed One be understood, where one who is celibate and one who is not celibate both have exactly the same destination in their future life? My father Purāna was celibate, living apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the common person's practice. When he died, the Blessed One declared: 'He attained to the state of a once-returner and has been reborn in the Tusita group [of devas].' My paternal uncle Isidatta ${ }^{2092}$ was not celibate but lived a contented married life. When he died, the Blessed One also declared: 'He attained to the state of a once-returner and has been reborn in the Tusita group [of devas].' Bhante Ānanda, just how should this teaching of the Blessed One be understood, where one who is celibate and one who is not celibate both have exactly the same destination in their future life?"

"It was just in this way, sister, that the Blessed One declared it."

Then, when the Venerable Ārianda had received almsfood at Migasālā's house, he rose from his seat and departed. After his meal, on returning from his alms round, he went to the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: "Here, Bhante, in the morning, I dressed, took my bowl and robe, and went to the house of the female lay follower Migasāla....[139] [all as above, down to]... When she asked me this, I replied: 'It was just in this way, sister, that the Blessed One declared it."

[The Blessed One said:] "Who, indeed, is the female lay follower Migasālā, a foolish, incompetent woman with a woman's intellect? And who are those [who have] the knowledge of other persons as superior and inferior? ${ }^{2093}$

"There are, Ānanda, these ten types of persons found existing in the world. What ten?

(1) "Here, Ānanda, there is one person who is immoral and does not understand as it really is that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, where that immorality of his ceases without remainder. ${ }^{2094}$ And he has not listened [to the teachings], become learned [in them], penetrated [them] by view, and he does not attain temporary liberation. With the breakup of the body, after death, he heads for deterioration, not for distinction; he is one going to deterioration, not to distinction.

(2) "Then, Ānanda, there is one person who is immoral yet understands as it really is that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, [140] where that immorality of his ceases without
remainder. And he has listened [to the teachings], become learned [in them], penetrated [them] by view, and he attains temporary liberation. With the breakup of the body, after death, he heads for distinction, not for deterioration; he is one going to distinction, not to deterioration.

"Ānanda, those who are judgmental will pass such judgment on them: 'This one has the same qualities as the other. Why should one be inferior and the other superior?' That [judgment] of theirs will indeed lead to their harm and suffering for a long time.

"Between them, Ānanda, the person who is immoral, and who understands as it really is that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, where that immorality of his ceases without remainder; who has listened [to the teachings]; become learned [in them], penetrated [them] by view, and who attains temporary liberation, surpasses and excels the other person. For what reason? Because the Dhamma-stream carries him along. But who can know this difference except the Tathāgata?

"Therefore, Ānanda, do not be judgmental regarding people. Do not pass judgment on people. Those who pass judgment on people harm themselves. I alone, or one like me, may pass judgment on people. [141]

# IV. The Elders

81 (1) Bāhuna

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Campā on a bank of the Gaggārā Lotus Pond. Then the Venerable Bāhuna approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, from how many things is the Tathāgata released, detached, and emancipated, that he dwells with a mind free from boundaries?" [152]

"Bāhuna, it is because the Tathāgata is released, detached, and emancipated from ten things that he dwells with a mind free from boundaries. What ten? (1) It is because the Tathāgata is released, detached, and emancipated from form that he dwells with a mind free from boundaries. (2)-(5) It is because the Tathāgata is released, detached, and emancipated from feeling . . perception . . . volitional activities . . consciousness that he dwells with a mind free from boundaries. (6)-(10) It is because the Tathāgata is released, detached, and emancipated from birth ... old age . . . death . . . suffering . . . defilements that he dwells with a mind free from boundaries.

"Just as a blue, red, or white lotus flower, though born in the water and grown up in the water, rises up above the water and stands unsoiled by the water, ${ }^{2100}$ even so, Bāhuna, it is because
the Tathāgata is released, detached, and emancipated from these ten things that he dwells with a mind free from boundaries."

# 82 (2) Ānanda

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

(1) "It is impossible, Ānanda, that a bhikkhu without faith will achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline. (2) It is impossible that an immoral bhikkhu... (3) ...a bhikkhu of little léarning ... (4) ... a bhikkhu who is difficult to correct ...[153] (5) ... a bhikkhu who has bad friends ... (6) ... a lazy bhikkhu ... (7) ... a muddle-minded bhikkhu ...

It is impossible that a bhikkhu who possesses these ten qualities will achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline.

(1) "It is possible, Ānanda, that a bhikkhu endowed with faith will achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline. (2) It is possible that a virtuous bhikkhu ...

83 (3) Punniya ${ }^{2101}$

Then the Venerable Punniya approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, why is it that at times the Tathāgata is disposed to teach the Dhamma and at times is not disposed [to teach]?"

(1) "When, Punniya, a bhikkhu is endowed with faith but does not approach him, the Tathāgata is not disposed to teach the Dhamma. (2) But when a bhikkhu is endowed with faith and approaches him, the Tathāgata is disposed to teach.

(3) "When, Punniya, a bhikkhu is endowed with faith and
approaches him, but he does not attend on him ... (4) When he attends on him but does not ask questions ... (5) When he asks questions but does not listen to the Dhamma with eager ears... (6) When he listens to the Dhamma with eager ears, but having heard it, does not retain it in mind ... (7) When, having heard it, he retains it in mind but does not examine the meaning of the teachings that have been retained in mind ... (8) When he examines the meaning of the teachings that have been retained in mind but does not [155] understand the meaning and the Dhamma and then practice in accordance with the Dhamma... (9) When he understands the meaning and the Dhamma and then practices in accordance with the Dhamma, but he is not a good speaker with a good delivery, one gifted with speech that is polished, clear, articulate, expressive of the meaning ... (10) When he is a good speaker with a good delivery, one gifted with speech that is polished, clear, articulate, expressive of the meaning, but he does not instruct, encourage, inspire, and gladden his fellow monks, the Tathāgata is not disposed to teach the Dhamma.

"But, Punniya, (1) when a bhikkhu is endowed with faith, (2) approaches [the Tathāgata], (3) attends on [the Tathāgata], (4) asks questions, and (5) listens to the Dhamma with eager ears; and (6) having heard the Dhamma, he retains it in mind, (7) examines the meaning of the teachings he has retained in mind, and (8) understands the meaning and the Dhamma and then practices in accordance with the Dhamma; and (9) he is a good speaker with a good delivery, one gifted with speech that is polished, clear, articulate, expressive of the meaning; and (10) he instructs, encourages, inspires, and gladdens his fellow monks, the Tathāgata is disposed to teach the Dhamma. When, Punniya, one possesses these ten qualities, the Tathāgata is entirely disposed to teach the Dhamma."

# 84 (4) Declaration

There the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend," those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this:

"Here, friends, a bhikkhu declares final knowledge thus: 'I understand: "Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming
back to any state of being." The Tathāgata [156] or his disciple who is a jhāna-attainer-skilled in attainment, skilled in others' minds, skilled in the ways of others' minds-questions him, interrogates him, and cross-examines him. When he is being questioned, interrogated, and cross-examined by the Tathāgata or his disciple, he comes to an impasse and is flustered. He meets with calamity, meets with disaster, meets with calamity and disaster.

"The Tathāgata or his disciple who is a jhāna-attainer . . . encompasses his mind with his own mind and considers: 'Why does this venerable one declare final knowledge thus: "I understand: 'Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.'"?' The Tathāgata or his disciple, having encompassed his mind with his own mind, understands:

# 85 (5) The Boaster

On one occasion the Venerable Mahācunda was dwelling among the Cetis at Sahajāti. There the Venerable Mahācunda addressed the bhikkhus:

"Friends, bhikkhüs!"

"Friend!" those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Mahācunda said this:

"Here, friends, a bhikkhu is a boaster, one who brags about achievements: 'I attain and emerge from the first jhāna. I attain and emerge from the second jhāna . . . the third jhāna . . . the fourth jhāna ...

(1) "'For a long time this venerable one's conduct has been broken, flawed, blemished, and blotched, and he does not consistently observe and follow virtuous behavior. This venerable one is immoral. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, immorality is a case of decline.

(10) "'This venerable one is unwise. But in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, lack of wisdom is a case of decline.'

"Suppose, friends, that one man would say to his companion:
'Whenever you need money for anything, my friend, just ask me and I'll give it to you.' When the companion has need of money, he says to his friend: 'I need money, friend. Give me some.' The other says: 'In that case, friend, dig here.' He digs there but doesn't find anything. He then says: 'You lied to me, friend, you spoke falsely when you told me to dig here.' The other says: 'I didn't lie to you, friend, I didn't speak falsely. Rather, dig there.' He digs there as well but doesn't find anything. Again, he says: 'You lied to me, friend, you spoke falsely when you told me to dig there.' The other says: 'I didn't lie to you, friend, I didn't speak falsely. [160] Rather, dig there.' He digs there as well but doesn't find anything.

# 86 (6) Final Knowledge

On one occasion the Venerable Mahākassapa was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. There the Venerable [162] Mahākassapa addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend," those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Mahākassapa said this:

"Here, friends, a bhikkhu declares final knowledge thus: 'I understand: "Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being."' The Tathāgata or his disciple who is a jhāna-attainer-skilled in attainment, skilled in others' minds, skilled in the ways of others' minds-questions him, interrogates him, and cross-examines him. When he is being
questioned, interrogated, and cross-examined by the Tathāgata or his disciple, he comes to an impasse and is flustered. He meets with calamity, meets with disaster, meets with calamity and disaster.

"The Tathāgata or his disciple who is a jhāna-attainer . . . encompasses his mind with his own mind and considers: 'Why does this venerable one declare final knowledge thus: "I understand: 'Destroyed is birth . . . there is no more coming back to any state of being"'?' The Tathāgata or his disciple, having encompassed his mind with his own mind, understands: 'This venerable one overestimates himself, imagines that his estimate of himself is valid, thinks that he has attained what he has not attained, accomplished what he has not accomplished, and achieved what he has not achieved, and by overestimation of himself he declares final knowledge thus: "I understand: 'Destroyed is birth . . . there is no more coming back to any state of being.'"

"The Tathāgata or his disciple who is a jhāna-attainer . . . encompasses his mind with his own mind and considers: 'Why does this venerable one overestimate himself and imagine that his estimate of himself is valid; why does he think that he has attained what he has not attained, accomplished what he has not accomplished, and achieved what he has not achieved; and why, by overestimation of himself, does he declare final knowledge thus: "I understand: 'Destroyed is [163] birth . . . there is no more coming back to any state of being"'?'

"The Tathāgata or his disciple who is a jhāna-attainer ... having encompassed his mind with his own mind, understands: 'This venerable one has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and accumulates what he has learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life-such teachings as these he has learned much of, retained in mind, recited verbally, investigated mentally, and penetrated well by view. Therefore this venerable one overestimates himself and imagines that his estimate of himself is valid; he thinks that he has attained what he has not attained, accomplished what he has not accomplished, and achieved what he has not achieved; and by overestimation of himself he declares final knowledge

# 87 (7) Disciplinary Issues

There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus with reference to the bhikkhu Kalandaka: ${ }^{2105}$ "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied.

The Blessed One said this:

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is a maker of disciplinary issues and he does not speak in praise of the settlement of disciplinary issues. When a bhikkhu is a maker of disciplinary issues and does not speak in praise of the settlement of disciplinary issues, this is a quality that does not lead to affection, respect, esteem, accord, or unity. ${ }^{2106}[165]$

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu does not desire training and he does not speak in praise of undertaking the training. When a bhikkhu does not desire training ... this, too, is a quality that does not lead to ... unity.

(3) "Again, a bhikkhu has evil desires and he does not speak in praise of the removal of desire. When a bhikkhu has evil desires ... this, too, is a quality that does not lead to ... unity.

(4) "Again, a bhikkhu is prone to anger and he does not speak in praise of the removal of anger. When a bhikkhu is prone to anger ... this, too, is a quality that does not lead to ... unity.

(5) "Again, a bhikkhu is one who denigrates [others] and he does not speak in praise of the removal of denigration. When a bhikkhu is one who denigrates ... this, too, is a quality that does not lead to ... unity.

(6) "Again, a bhikkhu is crafty and he does not speak in praise of the removal of craftiness. When a bhikkhu is crafty . . this, too, is a quality that does not lead to ... unity.

When a bhikkhu does not show hospitality to his fellow monks and he does not speak in praise of one who shows hospitality, this, too, is a quality that does not lead to affection, respect, esteem, accord, or unity.

"Although such a bhikkhu might wish: 'Oh, if only my fellow monks would honor, respect, esteem, and venerate me!' yet his fellow monks do not honor, respect, esteem, and venerate him. For what reason? Because his wise fellow monks see that he has not abandoned those bad unwholesome qualities.

"Suppose a wild colt would wish: 'Oh, if only people would assign me a thoroughbred's place, feed me a thoroughbred's food, and give me a thoroughbred's grooming!' yet people do not assign him a thoroughbred's place, feed him a thoroughbred's food, and give him a thoroughbred's grooming. [167] For what reason? Because wise people see that he has not abandoned his tricks, ploys, gambits, and wiles. So too, although such a bhikkhu might wish: 'Oh, if only my fellow monks would honor, respect, esteem, and venerate me!' yet his fellow monks do not honor, respect, esteem, and venerate him. For what reason? Because his wise fellow monks see that he has not abandoned those bad unwholesome qualities.

(1) "But a bhikkhu is not a maker of disciplinary issues and he speaks in praise of the settlement of disciplinary issues. When a bhikkhu is not a maker of disciplinary issues and speaks in praise of the settlement of disciplinary issues, this is a quality that leads to affection, respect, esteem, accord, and unity.
(2) "Again, a bhikkhu desires training and he speaks in praise of undertaking the training. When a bhikkhu desires training this, too, is a quality that leads to ... unity.

"Suppose an excellent thoroughbred horse would not wish: 'Oh, if only people would assign me a thoroughbred's place, feed me a thoroughbred's food, and give me a thoroughbred's grooming!' yet people assign him a thoroughbred's place, feed
him a thoroughbred's food, [169] and give him a thoroughbred's grooming. For what reason? Because wise people see that he has abandoned his tricks, ploys, gambits, and wiles. So too, although such a bhikkhu might not wish: 'Oh, if only my fellow monks would honor, respect, esteem, and venerate me!' yet his fellow monks honor, respect, esteem, and venerate him. For what reason? Because his wise fellow monks see that he has abandoned those bad unwholesome qualities."

88 (8) One Who Insults ${ }^{2107}$

"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is one who insults and disparages his fellow monks, a reviler of the noble ones, it is impossible and inconceivable that he will not incur at least one of these ten disasters. What ten? (1) He does not achieve what he has not yet achieved. (2) He falls away from what he has achieved. (3) His good qualities are not polished. ${ }^{2108}$ (4) He overestimates his good qualities, or (5) leads the spiritual life dissatisfied, or (6) commits a certain defiled offense, or (7) contracts a severe illness, or (8) goes mad and becomes mentally deranged. (9) He dies confused. (10) With the breakup of the body; after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. When a bhikkhu is one who insults and disparages his fellow monks, a reviler of the noble ones, it is impossible and inconceivable that he will not incur at least one of these ten disasters." [170]

89 (9) Kokālika ${ }^{2109}$

Then the bhikkhu Kokālika approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: "Bhante, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have evil desires and have come under the control of evil desires."

[The Blessed One replied:] "Do not say so, Kokālika! Do notsay so, Kokālika! ${ }^{2110}$ Place confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, Kokālika. Sāriputta and Moggallāna are well behaved."

A second time the bhikkhu Kokālika said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, although I consider the Blessed One worthy of faith and trust, [I still say that] Sāriputta and Moggallāna have evil desires and have come under the control of evil desires."

"Do not say so, Kokālika!... Sāriputta and Moggallāna are well behaved."

A third time the bhikkhu Kokālika said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, although I consider the Blessed One worthy of faith and trust, [I still say that] Sāriputta and Moggallāna have evil desires and have come under the control of evil desires."

"Do not say so, Kokālika! Do not say so, Kokālika! Place confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, Kokālika. Sāriputta and Moggallāna are well behaved."

Then the bhikkhu Kokālika rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated the Blessed One keeping the right side toward him, and departed. Not long after the bhikkhu Kokālika had left, his entire body became covered with boils the size of mustard seeds. These then grew to the size of mung beans; then to the size of chickpeas; then to the size of jujube pits; then to the size of jujube fruits; then to the size of myrobalans; then to the size of unripe belli fruits; ${ }^{2111}$ then to the size of ripe belli fruits. When they had grown to the size of ripe belli fruits, they burst open, [171] exuding pus and blood. He then just lay on banana leaves like a fish that had swallowed poison.

Then the independent brahmā Tudu approached the bhikkhu Kokālika, ${ }^{2112}$ stood in the air, and said to him: "Place confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, Kokālika. Sāriputta and Moggallāna are well behaved."

"Who are you, friend?"

"I am the independent brahmā Tudu."

"Didn't the Blessed One declare you to be a non-returner, friend? Then why have you come back here? See how much wrong you have done. ${ }^{\prime 2113}$

Then the independent brahmā Tudu addressed the bhikkhu Kokālika in verse:

"When a person has taken birth an axe is born inside his mouth with which the fool cuts himself by uttering wrongful speech.

"He who praises one deserving blame ${ }^{2114}$ or blames one deserving praise casts with his mouth an unlucky throw by which he finds no happiness.
"Slight is the unlucky throw at dice that results in the loss of one's wealth, [the loss] of all, oneself included; much worse is this unlucky throw of harboring hate against the holy ones.

"For a hundred thousand and thirty-six nirabbudas, plus five abbudas, ${ }^{2115}$ the slanderer of noble ones goes to hell, having defamed them with evil speech and mind." [172]

Then the bhikkhu Kokālika died on account of that illness, and because of his resentment against Sāriputta and Moggallāna, after death he was reborn in the red-lotus hell. ${ }^{2116}$

Then, when the night had advanced, Brahmā Sahampati, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta's Grove, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and said to him: "Bhante, the bhikkhu Kokālika has died, and because of his resentment against Sāriputta and Moggallāna, after death he has been reborn in the red-lotus hell." This is what Brahmā Sahampati said. He then paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and disappeared right there.

Then, when the night had passed, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, last night, when the night had advanced, Brahmā Sahampati approached me and said to me ...[as above]... He then paid homage to me, circumambulated me keeping the right side toward me, and disappeared right there."

When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "How long, Bhante, is the life span in the red-lotus hell?"2117

"The life span in the red-lotus hell is long, bhikkhu. It is not easy to count it and say it is so many [173] years, or so many hundreds of years, or so many thousands of years, or so many hundreds of thousands of years."

"Then is it possible, Bhante, to give a simile?"

"It is, bhikkhu," the Blessed One said. "Suppose there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty measures of sesamum seed. At the end of every hundred years a man would remove one seed from it. In this manner the Kosalan cartload of twenty measures of
sesamum seed might be depleted and eliminated more quickly than (1) a life in a single abbuda hell would go by. (2) One life in the nirabbuda hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the abbuda hell; (3) one life in the ababa hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the nirabbuda hell; (4) one life in the ahaha hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the ababa hell; (5) one life in the atata hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the ahaha hell; (6) one life in the water-lily hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the atata hell; (7) one life in the sweet-fragrance hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the water-lily hell; (8) one life in the blue-lotus hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the sweet-fragrance hell; (9) one life in the white-lotus hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the blue-lotus hell; and (10) one life in the red-lotus hell is the equivalent of twenty lives in the white-lotus hell. Now, because he harbored resentment against Sāriputta and Moggallāna, the bhikkhu Kokālika has been reborn in the red-lotus hell."

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this: [174]

[The four verses are identical with those just above.]

90 (10) Powers ${ }^{2118}$

Then the Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Sāriputta, when a bhikkhu's taints have been destroyed, how many powers does he possess by reason of which he can claim [to have attained] the destruction of the taints: 'My taints have been destroyed'?"

"Bhante, when a bhikkhu's taints have been destroyed, he possesses ten powers by reason of which he can claim [to have attained] the destruction of the taints: 'My taints have been destroyed.' What ten?

(1) "Here, Bhante, a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has clearly seen all conditioned phenomena as they really are with correct wisdom as impermanent. [175] This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed on the basis of which he claims [to have attained] the destruction of the taints: 'My taints have been destroyed.'

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has clearly seen sensual pleasures as they really are with correct wisdom as
similar to a charcoal pit. This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed...

(3) "Again, the mind of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed slants, slopes, and inclines to seclusion; it is withdrawn, delights in renunciation, and is entirely finished with all things that are a basis for the taints. This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed...

(4) "Again, a bhikkhu with taints' destroyed has developed and well developed the four establishments of mindfulness: This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed...

(5)-(10) "Again, a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has developed and well developed the four right strivings ... the four bases for psychic potency ... the five spiritual faculties . . . the five powers [176] . . . the seven factors of enlightenment . . . the noble eightfold path. This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed on the basis of which he claims [to have attained] the destruction of the taints: 'My taints have been destroyed.'

"Bhante, when a bhikkhu's taints have been destroyed, he possesses these ten powers by reason of which he can claim [to have attained] the destruction of the taints: 'My taints have been destroyed.'"

"These, householder, are the ten kinds of persons who enjoy sensual pleasures found existing in the world. Of these ten, [182] the foremost, the best, the preeminent, the supreme, and the finest is the one enjoying sensual pleasures who seeks wealth righteously, without violence, and having obtained it, makes himself happy and pleased; and shares the wealth and does meritorious deeds; and uses that wealth without being. tied to it, infatuated with it, and blindly absorbed in it, seeing the danger in it and understanding the escape. Just as from a cow comes milk, from milk curd, from curd butter, from butter ghee, and from ghee comes cream-of-ghee, which is reckoned the foremost of all these, so too, of these ten kinds of persons who enjoy sensual pleasures, the foremost, the best, the preeminent, the supreme, and the finest is the one who seeks wealth righteously, without violence, and having obtained it, makes himself happy and pleased; and shares the wealth and does meritorious deeds; and uses that wealth without being tied to it, infatuated with it, and blindly absorbed in it, seeing the danger in it and understanding the escape."

92 (2) Enmity ${ }^{2122}$

Then the householder Anāthapindika approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Householder, when a noble disciple has eliminated five perils and enmities, possesses the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and thoroughly penetrated with wisdom the noble method, he might, if he so wished, declare of himself: 'I am one finished with hell, the animal realm, and the sphere of afflicted spirits; finished with the plane of misery, the bad destination, the lower world; I am a stream-enterer, no longer subject to [rebirth in] the lower world, fixed in destiny, heading for enlightenment.'

"What are the five perils and enmities that have been eliminated? [183] (1) Householder, one who destroys life, with the destruction of life as condition, creates peril and enmity pertaining to the present life and peril and enmity pertaining to future lives, and he also experiences mental pain and dejection. One who abstains from the destruction of life does not create such peril and enmity pertaining to the present life or such peril and enmity pertaining to future lives, nor does he experience mental pain and dejection. For one who abstains from the destruction of life, that peril and enmity has thus been eliminated.

(2) "One who takes what is not given...(3) One who engages in sexual misconduct...(4) One who speaks falsely...(5) One who indulges in liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, with indulgence in liquor, wine, and intoxicants as condition, creates peril and enmity pertaining to the present life and peril and enmity pertaining to future lives, and he also experiences mental pain and dejection. One who abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, does not create such peril and enmity pertaining to the present life or such peril and enmity pertaining to future lives, nor does he experience mental pain and dejection. For one who abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, that peril and enmity has thus been eliminated.

"These are the five perils and enmities that have been eliminated.

" "And what are the four factors of stream-entry that he possesses? (6) Here, householder, a noble disciple possesses
unwavering confidence in the Buddha thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' (7) He possesses unwavering confidence in the Dhamma thus: 'The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.' (8) He possesses unwavering confidence in the Sangha thus: 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is practicing the good way, practicing the straight way, practicing the true way, practicing the proper way; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals-this Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.' (9) He possesses the virtuous behavior loved by the noble ones, [184] unbroken, flawless, unblemished, unblotched, freeing, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading to concentration. These are the four factors of stream-entry that he possesses.

"And what is the noble method that he has clearly seen and thoroughly penetrated with wisdom? ${ }^{2123}$ (10) Here, householder, the noble disciple reflects thus: 'When this exists, that comes to be; with the arising of this, that arises. When this does not exist, that does not come to be; with the cessation of this, that ceases. That is, with ignorance as condition, volitional activities [come to be]; with volitional activities as condition, consciousness; with consciousness as condition, name-and-form; with name-and-form as condition, the six sense bases; with the six sense bases as condition, contact; with contact as condition, feeling; with feeling as condition, craving; with craving as condition, clinging; with clinging as condition, existence; with existence as condition, birth; with birth as condition, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish come to be. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.

"But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional activities; with the cessation of volitional activities, cessation of consciousness; with the cessation of consciousness, cessation of name-and-form; with the cessation of name-and-form, cessation of the six sense
bases; with the cessation of the six sense bases, cessation of contact; with the cessation of contact, cessation of feeling; with the cessation of feeling, cessation of craving; with the cessation of craving, cessation of clinging; with the cessation of clinging, cessation of existence; with the cessation of existence, cessation of birth; with the cessation of birth, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish cease. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.'

"This is the noble method that he has clearly seen and thoroughly penetrated with wisdom.

"Householder, when a noble disciple has eliminated these five perils and enmities, and he possesses these four factors of stream-entry, and he has clearly seen and thoroughly penetrated with wisdom this noble method, he might, if he so wished, declare of himself: 'I am one finished with hell, the animal realm, and the sphere of afflicted spirits; finished with the plane of misery, the bad destination, the lower world; I am a stream-enterer, no longer subject to [rebirth in] the lower world, fixed in destiny, heading for enlightenment.'"

# 93 (3) View

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Then the householder Anāthapindika left Sāvatthī in the middle of the day in order to see the Blessed One. It then occurred to him: "It is not the proper time to see the Blessed One, who is in seclusion, nor to see the esteemed bhikkhus, who are also in seclusion. Let me go to the park of the wanderers of other sects."

Then the householder Anāthapindika went to the park of the wanderers of other sects. Now on that occasion the wanderers of other sects had assembled and were making an uproar as they loudly and boisterously sat discussing various pointless topics. The wanderers saw the householder Anāthapindika coming in the distance and silenced one another: "Sirs, be quiet. Sirs, do not make any noise. Here comes the householder Anāthapindika, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, one among the ascetic Gotama's white-robed lay disciples who reside in Sāvatthī. Now these venerable ones are fond of quiet, disciplined in quiet, and speak in praise of quiet. Perhaps if he finds that our assembly is quiet, he will think to approach us." Then those wanderers of other sects became silent.

Then the householder Anāthapindika approached those wanderers and exchanged greetings with them. When they had concluded their greetings [186] and cordial talk, he sat down to one side. The wanderers then said to him:

"Tell us, householder, what is the ascetic Gotama's view?"

"Bhante, I don't know the Blessed One's view in its entirety."

"So, householder, you say you don't know the ascetic Gotama's view in its entirety. Then tell us, what is the bhikkhus' view?"

"Bhante, I also don't know the bhikkhus' view in its entirety."

"So, householder, you say you don't know the ascetic Gotama's view in its entirety and you also don't know the bhikkhus' view in its entirety. Then tell us, what is your view?"

"It isn't hard for me to explain my view, Bhante. But first explain your own views. Afterward it won't be hard for me to explain my view."

When this was said, one wanderer said to the householder Anāthapindika: (1) "'The world is eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong': such is my view, householder." (2) Another wanderer said: "'The world is non-eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong': such is my view, householder." (3)-(4) Still another said: "'The world is finite' ... 'The world is infinite' ... (5)-(6) 'The soul and the body are the same' ... 'The soul is one thing, the body another' ... (7)-(10) 'The Tathāgata exists after death'... 'The Tathāgata does not exist after death'... 'The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death' . . 'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death'; this alone is true, anything else is wrong: such is my view, householder. ${ }^{\prime 2124}$

When this was said, the householder Anāthapindika said to those wanderers: "Bhante, this venerable one said thus: "The world is eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wriag": such is my view, [187] householder.' This view of is as arisen because of his own careless attention or conditioner by someone else's utterance. Now this view has come into being and is conditioned, a product of volition, dependently originated. But whatever has come into being and is conditioned, a product of volition, dependently originated; is impermanent. Whatever is impermanent is suffering. It is just suffering that he is attached to and holds to.
"Bhante, this [other] venerable one said thus: "The world is non-eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong": such is my view, householder.' This view of his has also arisen because of his own careless attention or conditioned by someone else's utterance. Now this view has come into being and is conditioned, a product of volition, dependently originated. But whatever has come into being and is conditioned, a product of volition, dependently originated, is impermanent. Whatever is impermanent is suffering. It is just suffering that he is attached to and holds to.

"Bhante, this venerable one said thus: "The world is finite". ..."The world is infinite" ..."The soul and the body are the same" ..."The soul is one thing, the body another" ..."The Tathāgata exists after death" ..."The Tathāgata does not exist after death" ..."The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death" ..."The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death"; this alone is true, anything else is wrong: such is my view, householder.' This view of his has also arisen because of his own careless attention or conditioned by someone else's utterance. Now this view has come into being and is conditioned, a product of volition, dependently originated. But whatever has come into being and is conditioned, a product of volition, dependently originated, is impermanent. Whatever is impermanent is suffering. It is just suffering that he is attached to and holds to." [188]

When this was said, those wanderers said to the householder Anāthapindika: "We have each explained our own views, householder. Now tell us your view."

"Bhante, whatever has come into being and is conditioned, a product of volition, dependently originated, is impermanent. Whatever is impermanent is suffering. Whatever is suffering is not mine; I am not this; this is not my self. That is my view."

"Householder, whatever has come into being and is conditioned, a product of volition, dependently originated, is impermanent. Whatever is impermanent is suffering. It is just suffering that you are attached to and hold to."

"Bhante, whatever has come into being and is conditioned, a product of volition, dependently originated, is impermanent. Whatever is impermanent is suffering. Having clearly seen what is suffering as it really is with correct wisdom thus: 'This
is not mine; I am not this; this is not my self,' I understand as it really is the superior escape from it."

When this was said, those wanderers sat silenced, disconcerted, hunched over, downcast, glum, and speechless. Then the householder Anāthapindika, having understood that those wanderers [sat] silenced . . . and speechless, rose from his seat and went to the Blessed One. He paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side, and reported to the Blessed One his entire conversation with those wanderers.

[The Blessed One said:] "Good, good, householder! It is in such a way that those hollow men should from time to time be thoroughly refuted with reasoned argument. ${ }^{\prime 2125}$ Then the Blessed One instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened the householder Anāthapindika with a Dhamma talk. Then, when the householder Anāthapindika had been instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened by the Blessed One with a Dhamma talk, [189] he rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed.

Then, not long after the householder Anāthapindika had left, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, if any bhikkhu, even one ordained for a hundred years in this Dhamma and discipline, would thoroughly refute with reasoned argument the wanderers of other sects, he would refute them just as the householder Anāthapindika has done."

# 94 (4) Vajjiyamāhita

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Campā on a bank of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. Then the householder Vajjiyamāhita left Campā in the middle of the day to see the Blessed One. It then occurred to him: "It is not the proper time to see the Blessed One, who is in seclusion, nor to see the esteemed bhikkhus, who are also in seclusion. Let me go to the park of the wanderers of other sects."

Then the householder Vajjiyamāhita went to the park of the wanderers of other sects ... [all as in 10:93] [190] ...

Then the householder Vajjiyamāhita approached those wanderers and exchanged greetings with them. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side. The wanderers then said to him:
"Is it true, householder, as it is said, that the ascetic Gotama criticizes all austerities and that he unreservedly condemns and reproves all who live a harsh and austere life?"

"No, Bhante, the Blessed One does not criticize all austerities and he does not unreservedly condemn and reprove all who live a harsh and austere life. The Blessed One criticizes what deserves criticism and praises what is praiseworthy. By criticizing what deserves criticism and praising what is praiseworthy, the Blessed One speaks on the basis of distinctions; he does not speak about such matters one-sidedly." ${ }^{2126}$

When this was said, a wanderer said to the householder Vajjiyamāhita: "Wait a moment, householder! That ascetic Gotama whom you are praising is an abolitionist who refrains from making definite declarations."

"I will deal with that point, too, Bhante. The Blessed One has validly declared: 'This is wholesome' and: 'This is unwholesome.' Thus, when he declares what is wholesome and what is unwholesome, the Blessed One makes definite declarations. He is not an abolitionist who refrains from making definite declarations."

When this was said, those wanderers [191] sat silenced, disconcerted, hunched over, downcast, glum, and speechless. Then the householder Vajjiyamāhita, having understood that those wanderers [sat] silenced ... and speechless, rose from his seat and went to the Blessed One. He paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side, and reported to the Blessed One his entire conversation with those wanderers of other sects.

[The Blessed One said:] "Good, good, householder! It is in such a way that those hollow men should from time to time be thoroughly refuted with reasoned argument."

(1)-(2) "I do not say, householder, of every kind of austerity that it should be practiced; nor do I say of every kind of austerity that it should not be practiced. (3)-(4) I do not say of every observance that it should be undertaken; nor do I say of every observance that it should not be undertaken. (5)-(6) I do not say that one should strive in every way; nor do I say that one should not strive in any way. (7)-(8) I do not say that one should make every kind of relinquishment; nor do I say that one should not make any kind of relinquishment. (9)-(10) I do not say that one should attain every kind of liberation; nor do I say that one should not attain any kind of liberation.
(1)-(2) "If, householder, when one practices a particular austerity, unwholesome qualities increase and wholesome qualities decline, then, I say, one should not practice such austerity. But if, when one practices a particular austerity, unwholesome qualities decline and wholesome [192] qualities increase, then, I say, one should practice such austerity.

(3)-(4) "If, householder, when one undertakes a particular observance, unwholesome qualities increase and wholesome qualities decline, then, I say, one should not undertake such an observance. But if, when one undertakes a particular observance, unwholesome qualities decline and wholesome qualities increase, then, I say, one should undertake such an observance.

(5)-(6) "If, householder, when one strives in a particular way, unwholesome qualities increase and wholesome qualities decline, then, I say, one should not strive in such a way. But if, when one strives in a particular way, unwholesome qualities decline and wholesome qualities increase, then, I say, one should strive in such a way.

(7)-(8) "If, householder, when one relinquishes something, unwholesome qualities increase and wholesome qualities decline, then, I say, one should not make such a relinquishment. But if, when one relinquishes something, unwholesome qualities decline and wholesome qualities increase, then, I say, one should make such a relinquishment.

(9)-(10) "If, householder, when one attains a particular liberation, unwholesome qualities increase and wholesome qualities decline, then, I say, one should not attain such a liberation. But if, when one attains a particular liberation, unwholesome qualities decline and wholesome qualities increase, then, I say, one should attain such a liberation."

Then, when the householder Vajjiyamāhita had been instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened by the Blessed One with a Dhamma talk, he rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed.

Then, not long after the householder Vajjiyamāhita had left, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, if an: bhikkhu, even one who has long had little dust in his eycs regarding this Dhamma and discipline, would thoroughly refute with reasoned argument the wanderers of other sects,
he would refute them in just such a way as the householder Vajjiyamāhita has done." [193]

# 95 (5) Uttiya

Then the wanderer Uttiya approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

(1) "How is it, Master Gotama, is the world eternal? Is this alone true and anything else wrong?"

"Uttiya, I have not declared: 'The world is eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong.'"

(2) "Then, Master Gotama, is the world not eternal? Is this alone true and anything else wrong?"

"Uttiya, I also have not declared: 'The world is not eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong.'"

(3)-(4) "How is it then, Master Gotama, is the world finite? . . . Is the world infinite? . . (5)-(6) Are the soul and the body the same? ...Is the soul one thing, the body another? ... (7)-(10) Does the Tathāgata exist after death? ... Does the Tathāgata not exist after death? . . Does the Tathāgata both exist and not exist after death? . . . Does the Tathāgata neither exist nor not exist after death? Is this alone true and anything else wrong?"

"Uttiya, I also have not declared: 'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death; this alone is true, anything else is wrong."'2127

"When I asked you: 'How is it, Master Gotama, is the world eternal? Is this alone true and anything else wrong?' you said: 'Uttiya, I have not declared: "The world is eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong."' But when I asked you: 'Then, Master Gotama, is the world not eternal? Is this alone true and anything else wrong?' you said: 'Uttiya, I also have not declared: "The world is not eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong."' When I asked you: 'How is it then, Master Gotama, is the world finite? . . Does the Tathāgata neither exist nor not exist after death? Is this alone true and anything else wrong?' [194] you said: 'Uttiya, I also have not declared: "The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death; this alone is true, anything else is wrong."' What, then, has Master Gotama declared?"

"Through direct knowledge, Uttiya, I teach the Dhamma to
my disciples for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and dejection, for the achievement of the method, for the realization of nibbāna."

"But when Master Gotama, through direct knowledge, teaches the Dhamma to his disciples for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and dejection, for the achievement of the method, for the realization of nibbāna, will the entire world be thereby emancipated, or half the world, or a third of the world?"

When this was asked, the Blessed One remained silent. Then it occurred to the Venerable Ānanda: "The wanderer Uttiya had better not adopt the evil view: 'When I ask the ascetic Gotama the most elevated question of all, he falters and does not answer. ${ }^{2128}$ It must be that he is unable to do so.' This would lead to the wanderer Uttiya's harm and suffering for a long time."

Then the Venerable Ananda said to the wanderer Uttiya: "Well then, friend Uttiya, I will give you a simile. Some intelligent people here understand the meaning of what is said by means of a simile. Suppose a king had a frontier city with strong ramparts, walls, and arches, and with a single gate. The gatekeeper posted there would be wise, competent, and intelligent; one who keeps out strangers [195] and admits acquaintances. While he is walking along the path that encircles the city he would not see a cleft or an opening in the walls even big enough for a cat to slip through. He might not know how many living beings enter or leave the city, but he could be sure that whatever large living beings enter or leave the city all enter and leave through that gate. So too, friend Uttiya, the Tathāgata has no concern whether the entire world will be emancipated, or half the world, or a third of the world. But he can be sure that all those who have been emancipated, or who are being emancipated, or who will be emancipated from the world first abandon the five hindrances, corruptions of the mind that weaken wisdom, and then, with their minds well established in the four establishments of mindfulness, develop correctly the seven factors of enlightenment. It is in this way that they have been emancipated or are being emancipated or will be emancipated from the world.

"Friend Uttiya, you asked the Blessed One from a different
angle the same question that you had already asked him. ${ }^{2129}$ Therefore the Blessed One did not answer you." [196]

96 (6) Kokanada ${ }^{2130}$

On one occasion the Venerable Ānanda was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Park. Then, as the night was receding, the Venerable Ānanda rose and went to the hot springs to bathe. Having bathed in the hot springs and come back out, he stood in one robe drying his limbs. The wanderer Kokanada, too, rose as the night was receding and went to the hot springs to bathe. He saw the Venerable Ananda from a distance and said to him:

"Who is here, friend?"

"I am a bhikkhu, friend."

"From which group of bhikkhus, friend?"

"From the ascetics following the Sakyan son."

"If you could take the time to answer my question, I would like to ask you about a certain point."

"You may ask, friend. When I hear your question, I'll know [whether I can answer it]."

"How is it, sir, do you hold the view: (1) 'The world is eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong'?"

"I don't hold such a view, friend."

"Then do you hold the view: (2) 'The world is not eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong'?"

"I don't hold such a view, friend."

"Do you hold the view: (3)-(4) 'The world is finite'... 'The world is infinite'...(5)-(6) 'The soul and the body are the same' ... 'The soul is one thing, the body another'...(7)-(10) 'The Tathāgata exists after death'...'The Tathāgata does not exist after death'...'The Tathāgata both exists and [197] does not exist after death'...'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death; this alone is true, anything else is wrong'?"

"I don't hold such a view, friend."

"Could it then be that you do not know and see?"

"It isn't the case, friend, that I do not know and see. I know and see."

"When I asked you: 'How is it, sir, do you hold the view: "The world is eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong"?' you said: 'I don't hold'such a view, friend.' But when I asked
you: 'Then do you hold the view: "The world is not eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong"?' you said: 'I don't hold such a view, friend.' When I asked you: 'Do you hold the view: "The world is finite" . . "The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death; this alone is true, anything else is wrong"?' you said: 'I don't hold such a view, friend.' Then when I asked you: 'Could it then be that you do not know and see?' you said: 'It isn't the case, friend, that I do not know and see. I know and see.' How, friend, should the meaning of this statement be understood?"

"'The world is eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong,' friend: this is a speculative view. 'The world is not eternal; this alone is true, anything else is wrong': this is a speculative view. 'The world is finite' . . 'The world is infinite' . . 'The soul and the body are the same' . . 'The soul is one thing, the body another' . . 'The Tathāgata exists after death' . . 'The Tathāgata does not exist after death' . . 'The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death' . . 'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death; this alone is true, [198] anything else is wrong': this is a speculative view.

"To the extent, friend, that there is a speculative view, a basis for views, ${ }^{2131}$ a foundation for views, obsession with views, the origination of views, and the uprooting of views, I know and see this. When I know and see this, why should I say: 'I do not know and see.' I know, friend, I see."

"What is your name? And how are you known by your fellow monks?"

"My name is Ānanda, and my fellow monks know me as Ānanda."

"Indeed, I did not realize that I was consulting the great teacher, the Venerable Ānanda! If I had realized that this was the Venerable Ānanda, I wouldn't have spoken so much. Let the Venerable Ānanda please pardon me."

# 97 (7) Worthy of Gifts

"Bhikkhus, possessing ten qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What ten?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the

Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them.

(2) "He has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and accumulates what he has learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning [199] and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life-such teachings as these he has learned much of, retained in mind, recited verbally, investigated mentally, and penetrated well by view.

(3) "He has good friends, good companions, good comrades.

(4) "He holds right view and has a correct perspective.

(5) "He wields the various kinds of psychic potency: having been one, he becomes many; having been many, he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he goes unhindered through a wall, through a rampart, through a mountain as though through space; he dives in and out of the earth as though it were water; he walks on water without sinking as though it were earth; seated cross-legged, he travels in space like a bird; with his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; he exercises mastery with the body as far as the brahmā world.

(6) "With the divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the human, he hears both kinds of sounds, the divine and human, those that are far as well as near.

(7) "He understands the minds of other beings and persons, having encompassed them with his own mind. He understands a mind with lust as a mind with lust, and a mind without lust as a mind without lust; a mind with hatred as a mind with hatred, and a mind without hatred as a mind without hatred; a mind with delusion as a mind, with delusion, and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion; a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted; an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted; a surpassable mind as surpassable and an unsurpassable mind as unsurpassable; a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated; a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated. ${ }^{2153}$

(8) "He recollects his manifold past abodes, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, [200] five births, ten births,
twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many eons of world-dissolution, many eons of world-evolution, many eons of world-dissolution and world-evolution thus: 'There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere, and there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn here.' Thus he recollects his manifold past abodes with their aspects and details.

(9) "With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma thus: 'These beings who engaged in misconduct by body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong view, and undertook kamma based on wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; but these beings who engaged in good conduct by body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right view, and undertook kamma based on right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.' Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma.

(10) "With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. [201]

"Possessing these ten qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

# 98 (8) An Elder

"Bhikkhus, possessing ten qualities, an elder bhikkhu dwells at ease in whatever quarter he-lives: What ten? (1) An elder is
of long-standing, long gone forth. (2) He is virtuous. . . . Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. (3) He has learned much . . . and penetrated well by view. (4) Both Pätimokkhas have been well transmitted to him in detail, well analyzed, well mastered, well determined in terms of the rules and their detailed explication. (5) He is skilled in the origination and settlement of disciplinary issues. (6) He loves the Dhamma and is pleasing in his assertions, filled with a lofty joy pertaining to the Dhamma and discipline. (7) He is content with any kind of robe, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick. (8) He is graceful when going forward and returning, and also well restrained when sitting among the houses. (9) He gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life. (10) With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. Possessing these ten qualities, an elder bhikkhu dwells at ease in whatever quarter he lives."

# 99 (9) Upāli

Then the Venerable Upāli approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, [202] and said: "Bhante, I wish to resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves."

"Remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves are hard to endure, Upāli. Solitude is hard to undertake and hard to delight in. When he is alone, the woods steal the mind of a bhikkhu who does not gain concentration. It can be expected that one who says 'I do not gain concentration, yet I will resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves' will either sink or float away. ${ }^{2133}$

"Suppose, Upāli, there was a large lake, and a bull elephant seven or eight cubits in size would come along. He might think: 'Let me enter this lake and playfully wash my ears and back. I will bathe and drink, come out, and set off wherever I want.' He then enters the lake and playfully washes his ears and back. He bathes and drinks, comes out, and sets off wherever he wants. How so? Because his large body finds a footing in the depths.

"Then a hare or a cat comes along. It might think: 'How is a
bull elephant different from myself? I'll enter this lake and playfully wash my ears and back. [203] I will bathe and drink, come out, and set off wherever I want.' Then, without reflecting, it hastily enters the deep lake. It can be expected that it will either sink or float away. Why so? Because its small body does not find a footing in the depths. So too, it can be expected that one who would say: 'I do not gain concentration, yet I will resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves,' will either sink or float away.

"Suppose, Upāli, à young infant boy, lying on his back, would play with his own urine and feces. What do you think, isn't that a completely foolish type of amusement?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"Sometime later, when that boy grows up and his faculties mature, he would play the games that are typical for boysgames with toy plows, stick games, somersaults, games with pinwheels, games with measures made of leaves, games with toy chariots, games with toy bows. What do you think, isn't this amusement more excellent and sublime than the former kind?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"At a still later time, as that boy continues to grow up and his faculties mature still more, he enjoys himself furnished and endowed with the five objects of sensual pleasure: with forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensual pleasure, tantalizing; with sounds cognizable by the ear . . . with odors cognizable by the nose . . . with tastes cognizable by the tongue . . . with tactile objects cognizable by the body [204] that are wished for, desired, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensual pleasure, tantalizing. What do you think, isn't this amusement more excellent and sublime than the former kind?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"Here, Upāli, the Tathāgata arises in the world, ${ }^{2134}$ an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One. Having realized with his own direct knowledge this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, with
its devas and humans, he makes it known to others. He teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; he reveals the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life.

"A householder or householder's son or one born in some other clan hears this Dhamma. He then acquires faith in the Tathāgata and considers thus: 'Household life is crowded and dusty; life gone forth is wide open. It is not easy, while living at home, to lead the spiritual life that is utterly perfect and pure as a polished conch shell. Suppose I shave off my hair and beard, put on ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness.' On a later occasion, having abandoned a small or a large fortune, having abandoned a small or a large circle of relatives, he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness:

"Having thus gone forth and possessing the bhikkhus' training and way of life, having abandoned the destruction of life, he abstains from the destruction of life; with the rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious and kindly, he dwells compassionate toward all living beings. Having abandoned taking what is not given, he abstains from taking what is not given; he takes only what is given, expects only what is given, and dwells honestly without thoughts of theft. Having abandoned sexual activity, he observes celibacy, [205] living apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the common person's practice.

"Having abandoned false speech, he abstains from false speech; he speaks truth, adheres to truth; he is trustworthy and reliable, no deceiver of the world. Having abandoned divisive speech, he abstains from divisive speech; he does not repeat elsewhere what he has heard here in order to divide [those people] from these, nor does he repeat to these what he has heard elsewhere in order to divide [these people] from those; thus he is one who reunites those who are divided, a promoter of unity, who enjoys concord, rejoices in concord, delights in concord, a speaker of words that promote concord. Having abandoned harsh speech, he abstains from harsh speech; he speaks words that are gentle, pleasing to the ear, lovable, words that go to the heart, courteous words that are desired by many people and agreeable to many people. Having abandoned idle chatter, he abstains from idle chatter; he speaks at a proper time,
speaks what is fact, speaks on what is beneficial, speaks on the Dhamma and the discipline; at the proper time he speaks words that are worth recording, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.

"He abstains from injuring seeds and plants. He eats once a day, abstaining from eating at night and outside the proper time. He abstains from dancing, singing, instrumental music, and unsuitable shows. He abstains from adorning and beautifying himself by wearing garlands and applying scents and unguents. He abstains from high and large beds. He abstains from accepting gold and silver, raw grain, raw meat, women and girls, men and women slaves, goats and sheep, fowl and pigs, elephants, cattle, horses, and mares, fields and land. He abstains from going on errands and running messages; from buying and selling; from cheating with weights, metals, and measures; [206] from accepting bribes, deceiving, defrauding, and trickery. He abstains from wounding, murdering, binding, brigandage, plunder, and violence.

"He is content with robes to protect his body and almsfood to maintain his stomach, and wherever he goes he sets out taking only these with him. Just as a bird, wherever it goes, flies with its wings as its only burden, so too, a bhikkhu is content with robes to protect his body and almsfood to maintain his stomach, and wherever he goes he sets out taking only these with him. Possessing this aggregate of noble virtuous behavior, he experiences blameless bliss within himself.

"Having seen a form with the eye, he does not grasp at its marks and features. Since, if he left the eye faculty unrestrained, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him, he practices restraint over it; he guards the eye faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. Having heard a sound with the ear ... Having smelled an odor with the nose ... Having tasted a taste with the tongue . . . Having felt a tactile object with the body... Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, he does not grasp at its marks and features. Since, if he left the mind faculty unrestrained, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him, he practices restraint over it; he guards the mind faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty. Possessing this noble restraint of the faculties, he experiences unsullied bliss within himself.

"He acts with clear comprehension when going forward
and returning; he acts with clear comprehension when looking ahead and looking away; he acts with clear comprehension when bending and stretching his limbs; he acts with clear comprehension when wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl; he acts with clear comprehension when eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting; he acts with clear comprehension when defecating and urinating; he acts with clear comprehension when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and keeping silent.

"Possessing this aggregate of noble virtuous behavior, and this [207] noble restraint of the faculties, and this noble mindfulness and clear comprehension, he resorts to a secluded lodging: the forest, the root of a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a jungle thicket, an open space, a heap of straw.

"Having gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree; or to an empty hut, he sits down, folding his legs crosswise, straightening his body, and establishing mindfulness in front of him. Having abandoned longing for the world, he dwells with a mind free from longing; he purifies his mind from longing. Having abandoned ill will and hatred, he dwells with a mind free from ill will, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings; he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred. Having abandoned dullness and drowsiness, he dwells free from dullness and drowsiness, percipient of light, mindful and clearly comprehending; he purifies his mind from dullness and drowsiness. Having abandoned restlessness and remorse, he dwells without agitation, with a mind inwardly peaceful; he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorse. Having abandoned doubt, he dwells having gone beyond doubt, unperplexed about wholesome qualities; he purifies his mind from doubt.

(1) "Having thus abandoned these five hindrances, defilements of the mind, qualities that weaken wisdom, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters upon and dwells in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. What do you think, isn't this dwelling more excellent and sublime than those that precede it?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"It is when they see this quality within themselves that my
disciples resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves. But they still haven't attained their own goal. ${ }^{2135}$

(2) "Again, Upāli, with the subsiding of thought and examination, the bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna. . . . What do you think, isn't this dwelling more excellent and sublime than those that precede it?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"It is when they see this quality, too, within themselves [208] that my disciples resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves. But they still haven't attained their own goal.

After paying homage to him, they sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, the Blessed One taught this synopsis...[they here relate all that had taken place, adding:] [229]...Then, Bhante, we approached the Venerable Ānanda and asked him about the meaning. The Venerable Ā nanda expounded the meaning to us in these ways, in these terms and phrases."

"Good, good, bhikkhus! Ānanda is wise. Ānanda has great wisdom. If you had approached me and asked me the meaning of this, I would have explained it to you in the same way as Ananda: Such is the meaning of this, and so you should retain it in mind."

# 116 (4) Ajita ${ }^{2150}$

Then the wanderer Ajita approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side [230] and said to the Blessed One:

"Master Gotama, I have a fellow ascetic named Pandita. ${ }^{2151} \mathrm{He}$ has thought out five hundred arguments ${ }^{2152}$ by which those of other sects, when rebutted, know: 'We've been rebutted.'"

Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Do you remember, bhikkhus, Pandita's cases?"

"This is the time for it, Blessed One! This is the time for it, Fortunate One! Having heard this from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will retain in mind whatever the Blessed One says."

"Well then, bhikkhus, listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Here, someone refutes and disproves a doctrine contrary to the Dhamma with a doctrine contrary to the Dhamma. In this way, he delights an assembly contrary to the Dhamma. For this reason, the assembly contrary to the Dhamma becomes loud
and boisterous, exclaiming: 'He is truly wise, sir! He is truly wise, sir! ${ }^{\prime 2153}$

"Someone refutes and disproves a doctrine that accords with the Dhamma by means of a doctrine contrary to the Dhamma. In this way, he delights an assembly contrary to the Dhamma. For this reason, the assembly contrary to the Dhamma becomes loud and boisterous, exclaiming: 'He is truly wise, sir! He is truly wise, sir!'

"Someone refutes and disproves both a doctrine that accords with the Dhamma and a doctrine contrary to the Dhamma by means of a doctrine contrary to the Dhamma. In this way, he delights an assembly contrary to the Dhamma. For this reason, the assembly contrary to the Dhamma becomes loud and boisterous, exclaiming: 'He is truly wise, sir!

"Bhikkhus, what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma should be understood, and what is harmful and what is beneficial should be understood. Having understood what is nonDhamma and what is the Dhamma, and what is harmful and what is beneficial, one should practice in accordance with the Dhamma and with what is beneficial....

[The sutta continues exactly as in 10:114, ending:]

"When it was said: 'Bhikkhus, what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma should be understood, and what is harmful and what is beneficial should be understood. Having understood what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma, [232] and what is harmful and what is beneficial, one should practice in
accordance with the Dhamma and with what is beneficial,' it is with reference to this that this was said."

# 117 (5) Sangärava

Then the brahmin Sangārava approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

"Master Gotama, what is the near shore? What is the far shore?"

"Brahmin, (1) wrong view is the near shore, right view the far shore. (2) Wrong intention is the near shore, right intention the far shore. (3) Wrong speech is the near shore, right speech the far shore. (4) Wrong action is the near shore, right action the far shore. (5) Wrong livelihood is the near shore, right livelihood the far shore. (6) Wrong effort is the near shore, right effort the far shore. (7) Wrong mindfulness is the near shore, right mindfulness the far shore. (8) Wrong concentration is the near shore, right concentration the far shore. (9) Wrong knowledge is the near shore, right knowledge the far shore. (10) Wrong liberation is the near shore, right liberation the far shore. The one, brahmin, is the near shore, the other the far shore."

Few are those people ${ }^{2156}$

who go beyond.

The rest merely run

along the [near] shore.

When the Dhamma is rightly expounded those people who practice accordingly are the ones who will go beyond the realm of Death so hard to cross.

Having left the dark qualities behind, a wise person should develop the bright ones. Having come from home into homelessness, where it is hard to take delight-

There in seclusion one should seek delight, having left behind sensual pleasures.

Owning nothing, the wise person should cleanse himself of mental defilements. [233]

Those whose minds are rightly well developed in the enlightenment factors, who through non-clinging find delight in the relinquishment of grasping:

luminous, with taints destroyed, they are the quenched ones in the world. ${ }^{2157}$

# 118 (6) Near

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you the near shore and the far shore: Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"What, bhikkhus, is the near shore, and what is the far shore? (1) Wrong view, bhikkhus, is the near shore, right view the far shore ... (10) Wrong liberation is the near shore, right liberation the far shore. The one, bhikkhus, is the near shore, the other the far shore."

## 119 (7) Paccorohanī (1)

Now on that occasion, on the uposatha day, the brahmin Jāṇussonī stood to one side not far from the Blessed One, with his head washed, wearing a new pair of linen clothes, holding a handful of wet [234] kusa grass. The Blessed One saw him standing there and said to him:

"Why is it, brahmin, that on the uposatha day you stand to one side with your head washed, wearing a new pair of linen clothes, holding a handful of wet kusa grass? What is happening today with the brahmin clan?"

"Today, Master Gotama, is the brahmin clan's paccorohani festival. ${ }^{\prime 2158}$

"But how do the brahmins observe the paccorohani festival?"

"Here, Master Gotama, on the uposatha day, the brahmins wash their heads and put on a pair of new linen clothes. They then smear the ground with wet cow dung, cover this with green kusa grass, and lie down between the boundary and the
fire house. In the course of the night, they get up three times, and with reverential salutation pay homage to the fire: 'We descend in honor of the revered one. We descend in honor of the revered one. ${ }^{\prime 2159}$ They offer abundant ghee, oil, and butter to the fire. When the night has passed, they offer excellent food of various kinds to brahmins. It is in this way, Master Gotama, that the brahmins observe the paccorohan $\bar{\imath}$ festival."

"The paccorohan $\bar{\imath}$ festival in the Noble One's discipline, brahmin, is quite different from the paccorohan $\bar{\imath}$ festival of the brahmins."

"But how, Master Gotama, is the paccorohan $\bar{\imath}$ festival observed in the Noble One's discipline? It would be good if Master Gotama would teach me the Dhamma by explaining how the paccorohan $\bar{\imath}$ festival is observed in the Noble One's discipline."

"Well then, brahmin, listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, sir," the brahmin Jānussonī replied. The Blessed One said this: [235]

(1) "Here, brahmin, the noble disciple reflects thus: 'The result of wrong view is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong view; he descends from wrong view.

(2) "... The result of wrong intention is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong intention; he descends from wrong intention.

(3) "... The result of wrong speech is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong speech; he descends from wrong speech.

(4) "... The result of wrong action is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong action; he descends from wrong action.

(5) "... The result of wrong livelihood is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong livelihood; he descends from wrong livelihood.

(6) "... The result of wrong effort is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong effort; he descends from wrong effort.

(7) "... The result of wrong mindfulness is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong mindfulness; he descends from wrong mindfulness.
(8) "... The result of wrong concentration is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong concentration; he descends from wrong concentration.

(9) "... The result of wrong knowledge is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong knowledge; he descends from wrong knowledge.

(10) "... The result of wrong liberation is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong liberation; he descends from wrong liberation.

"It is in this way, brahmin, that the paccorohan $\bar{\imath}$ festival is observed in the Noble One's discipline."

"The puccorohan $\bar{\imath}$ festival in the Noble One's discipline, Master Gotama, is quite different from the paccorohan $\bar{\imath}$ festival of the brahmins. And the paccorohan festival of the brahmins is not worth a sixteenth part of the paccorohan festival in the Noble One's discipline. [236]

"Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the darkness so those with good eyesight can see forms. I now go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

# 120 (8) Paccorohanī (2)

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you the noble paccorohanī festival. Listen....

"And what, bhikkhus, is the noble paccorohanī festival? (1) Here, the noble disciple reflects thus: 'The result of wrong view is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong view; he descends from wrong view. (2) 'The result of wrong intention...(3) ... wrong speech... (4) ... wrong action... (5) ... wrong livelihood ...

Having
reflected thus, he abandons wrong liberation; he descends from wrong liberation. This is called the noble paccorohani festival."

# 121 (9) Forerunner

"Bhikkhus, just as the dawn is the forerunner and precursor of the sunrise, so right view is the forerunner and precursor of wholesome qualities. For one of right view, right intention originates. For one of right intention, right speech originates. For one of right speech, right action originates. For one of right action, right livelihood originates. For one of right livelihood, right effort originates. For one of right effort, right mindfulness originates. For one of right mindfulness, right concentration [237] originates. For one of right concentration, right knowledge originates. For one of right knowledge, right liberation originates."

## IV. GOOD

134 (1) Good

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you what is good and what is bad. Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"And what, bhikkhus, is bad? Wrong view, wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, wrong concentration, wrong knowledge, and wrong liberation. This is called bad.

"And what, bhikkhus, is good? [241] Right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration, right knowledge, and right liberation. This is called good."

## II. JANUSSONI

167 (1) Paccorohanī (1) ${ }^{2162}$

Now on that occasion, on the uposatha day, the brahmin Jāṇussonī stood to one side not far from the Blessed One, with
his head washed, wearing a new pair of linen clothes, holding a handful of wet kusa grass. The Blessed One saw him standing there and said to him:

"Why is it, brahmin, that on the uposatha day you stand to one side with your head washed, wearing a new pair of linen clothes, holding a handful of wet kusa grass? What is happening today with the brahmin clan?"

"Today, Master Gotama, is the brahmin clan's paccorohanī festival." [250]

"But how, brahmin, do the brahmins observe the paccorohanī festival?"

"Here, Master Gotama, on the uposatha day, the brahmins wash their heads and put on a pair of new linen clothes. They then smear the ground with wet cow dung, cover this with green kusa grass, and lie down between the boundary and the fire house. In the course of the night, they get up three times, and with reverential salutation pay homage to the fire: 'We descend in honor of the revered one. We descend in honor of the revered one.' They offer abundant ghee, oil, and butter to the fire. When the night has passed, they offer excellent food of various kinds to brahmins. It is in this way, Master Gotama, that the brahmins observe the paccorohanī festival."

"The paccorohanī festival in the Noble One's discipline, brahmin, is quite different from the paccorohanī festival of the brahmins."

"But how, Master Gotama, is the paccorohanī festival observed in the Noble One's discipline? It would be good if Master Gotama would teach me the Dhamma by explaining how the paccorohanī festival is observed in the Noble One's discipline."

"Well then, brahmin, listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, sir," the brahmin Jānussonī replied. The Blessed One said this:

(1) "Here, brahmin, the noble disciple reflects thus: 'The result of the destruction of life is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons the destruction of life; he descends from the destruction of life.

(2) "... The result of taking what is not given is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons taking what is not given; he descends from taking what is not given.
(3) ". . .' The result of sexual misconduct is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons sexual misconduct; he descends from sexual misconduct.

(4) ". . . The result of false speech is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' [251] Having reflected thus, he abandons false speech; he descends from false speech.

(5) ". . . The result of divisive speech is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons divisive speech; he descends from divisive speech.

(6) "... The result of harsh speech is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons harsh speech; he descends from harsh speech.

(7) "... The result of idle chatter is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons idle chatter; he descends from idle chatter.

(8) "... The result of longing is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons longing; he descends from longing.

(9) "... The result of ill will is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons ill will; he descends from ill will.

(10) "... The result of wrong view is bad both in this present life and in future lives.' Having reflected thus, he abandons wrong view; he descends from wrong view.

"It is in this way, brahmin, that the paccorohanī festival is observed in the Noble One's discipline.".

"The paccorohanī festival in the Noble One's discipline, Master Gotama, is quite different from the paccorohanī festival of the brahmins. And the paccorohanī festival of the brahmins is not worth a sixteenth part of the paccorohanī festival in the Noble One's discipline.

"Excellent, Master Gotama! . . [as in 10:119] . . . Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

# 168 (2) Paccorohanī (2)

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you the noble paccorohanī festival. Listen. . .

"And what, bhikkhus, is the noble paccorohanī festival? [252] (1) Here, the noble disciple reflects thus: 'The result of the destruction of life is bad both in this present life and in future

169 (3) Sangärava ${ }^{2163}$.

Then the brahmin Sangārava approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

"Master Gotama, what is the near shore? What is the far shore?"

"Brahmin, (1) the destruction of life is the near shore, abstention from the destruction of life the far shore. (2) Taking what is not given is the near shore, abstention from taking what is not given the far shore. (3) Sexual misconduct is the near shore, abstention from sexual misconduct the far shore. (4) False speech is the near shore, abstention from false speech the far shore. (5) Divisive speech is the near shore, abstention from divisive speech the far shore. (6) Harsh speech is the near shore, abstention from harsh speech the far shore. (7) Idle chatter is the near shore, abstention from idle chatter the far shore. (8) Longing is the near shore, non-longing the far shore. (9) Ill will is the near shore, good will the far shore. (10) Wrong view is the near shore, right view the far shore. The one, brahmin, is the near shore, the other the far shore." [253]

Few are those people who go beyond.

The rest merely run along the [near] shore.

When the Dhamma is rightly expounded those people who practice accordingly are the ones who will go beyond the realm of Death so hard to cross.

Having left the dark qualities behind, a wise person should develop the bright ones. Having come from home into homelessness, where it is hard to take delight-

There in seclusion one should seek delight, having left behind sensual pleasures. Owning nothing, the wise person should cleanse himself of mental defilements,

Those whose minds are rightly well developed in the enlightenment factors, who through non-clinging find delight in the relinquishment of grasping:

luminous, with taints destroyed, they are the quenched ones in the world.

170 (4) The Near Shore

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you the near shore and the far shore. Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"What, bhikkhus, is the near shore, and what is the far shore? (1) The destruction of life, bhikkhus, is the near shore, abstention from the destruction of life the far shore.... (10) Wrong view is the near shore, right view the far shore. The one, bhikkhus; is the near shore, the other the far shore." [254]

[The verses attached are identical with those of the preceding sutta.]

171 (5) Non-Dhamma (1) ${ }^{2164}$

"Bhikkhus, what is non-Dhamma and harmful should be understood, and what is the Dhamma and beneficial should also be understood. Having understood what is non-Dhamma and harmful, and also what is the Dhamma and beneficial, one should practice in accordance with the Dhamma and with what is beneficial.

"And what, bhikkhus, is non-Dhamma and harmful? The destruction of life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech, divisive speech, harsh speech, idle chatter,
longing, ill will, and wrong view. This is what is said to be non-Dhamma and harmful.

"And what, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma and beneficial? Abstention from the destruction of life, abstention from taking what is not given, abstention from sexual misconduct, abstention from false speech, abstention from divisive speech, abstention from harsh speech, abstention from idle chatter, non-longing, good will, and right view. This is what is said to be the Dhamma and beneficial.

"When it was said: 'Bhikkhus, what is non-Dhamma and harmful should be understood, and what is the Dhamma and beneficial should also be understood. Having understood what is non-Dhamma and harmful, and also what is the Dhamma and beneficial, one should practice in accordance with the Dhamma and with what is beneficial,' it is with reference to this that this was said." [255]

# 172 (6) Non-Dhamma (2)

"Bhikkhus, what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma should be understood, and what is harmful and what is beneficial should also be understood. Having understood what is non-Dhammä and what is the Dhamma, and also what is harmful and what is beneficial, one should practice in accordance with the Dhamma and with what is beneficial."

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One rose from his seat and entered his dwelling. Then, soon after the Blessed One had left, the bhikkhus considered: "Friends, the Blessed One taught this brief synopsis: 'Bhikkhus, what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma should be understood . . . one should practice in accordance with the Dhamma and with what is beneficial.' Then he rose from his seat and entered his dwelling without expounding its meaning in detail. Now who will expound its meaning in detail?' Then it occurred to them: "The Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his wise fellow monks; he is capable of expounding the detailed meaning of this brief synopsis. Let us approach the Venerable Mahākaccāna and ask him the meaning of this. We will retain it in mind as he explains it to us."

Then those bhikkhus approached the Venerable Mahākaccāna
and exchanged greetings with him, after which they sat down to one side and said: "Friend Mahākaccāna, the Blessed One taught this brief synopsis....[256]...Then he rose from his seat and entered his dwelling without expounding the meaning in detail. Soon after he left, we considered: 'Friends, the Blessed One taught this brief synopsis. . . [all as above down to:] . . . Let us approach the Venerable Mahākaccāna and ask him the meaning of this. We will retain it in mind as he explains it to us.' Let the Venerable Mahākaccāna expound it to us."

[The Venerable Mahākaccāna replied:] "Friends, it is as though a man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood, would pass over the root and trunk of a great tree possessed of heartwood, thinking that heartwood should be sought among the branches and foliage. And so it is with you. When you were face to face with the Teacher you passed by the Blessed One, thinking to ask me about the meaning. For, friends, knowing, the Blessed One knows; seeing, he sees; he has become vision, he has become knowledge, he has become the Dhamma, he has become Brahmā; he is the expounder, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the giver of the deathless, the lord of the Dhamma, the Tathāgata. That was the time when you [257] should have approached the Blessed One and asked him about the meaning. You should have retained it in mind as he would have explained it to you."

"Surely, friend Kaccāna, knowing, the Blessed One knows; seeing, he sees; he has become vision ... the Tathāgata. That was the time when we should have approached the Blessed One and asked him about the meaning, and we should have retained it in mind as he would have explained it to us. Yet the Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his wise fellow monks. He is capable of expounding the detailed meaning of this synopsis. Let the Venerable Mahākaccāna expound it without finding it troublesome."

"Then listen, friends, and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, friend," those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Mahākaccāna said this:

"Friends, the Blessed One taught this brief synopsis without expounding the detailed meaning: 'Bhikkhus, what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma should be understood, and what is harmful and what is beneficial should also
be understood. Having understood what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma, and also what is harmful and what is beneficial, one should practice in accordance with the Dhamma and with what is beneficial.' Now what, friends, is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma? And what is harmful and what is beneficial?

(1) "The destruction of life, friends, is non-Dhamma; abstention from the destruction of life is the Dhamma: The numerous bad unwholesome qualities that originate with the destruction of life as condition: these are harmful. The numerous wholesome qualities that reach fulfillment by development with abstention from the destruction of life as condition: these are beneficial.

(2) "Taking what is not given is non-Dhamma; abstention from taking what is not given is the Dhamma. [258] The numerous bad unwholesome qualities that originate with taking what is not given as condition: these are harmful. The numerous wholesome qualities that reach fulfillment by development with abstention from taking what is not given as condition: these are beneficial.

(3) "Sexual misconduct is non-Dhamma; abstention from sexual misconduct is the Dhamma. The numerous bad unwholesome qualities that originate with sexual misconduct as condition: these are harmful. The numerous wholesome qualities that reach fulfillment by development with abstention from sexual misconduct as condition: these are beneficial.

(4) "False speech is non-Dhamma; abstention from false speech is the Dhamma. The numerous bad unwholesome qualities that originate with false speech as condition: these are harmful. The numerous wholesome qualities that reach fulfillment by development with abstention from false speech as condition: these are beneficial.

(5) "Divisive speech is non-Dhamma; abstention from divisive speech is the Dhamma. The numerous bad unwholesome qualities that originate with divisive speech as condition: these are harmful. The numerous wholesome qualities that reach fulfillment by development with abstention from divisive speech as condition: these are beneficial.

(6) "Harsh speech is non-Dhamma; abstention from harsh speech is the Dhamma. The numerous bad unwholesome
qualities that originate with harsh speech as condition: these are harmful. The numerous wholesome qualities that reach fulfillment by development with abstention from harsh speech as condition: these are beneficial.

(7) "Idle chatter is non-Dhamma; abstention from idle chatter is the Dhamma. The numerous bad unwholesome qualities that originate with idle chatter as condition: these are harmful. The numerous wholesome qualities that reach fulfillment by development with abstention from idle chatter as condition: these are beneficial.

(8) "Longing is non-Dhamma; non-longing is the Dhamma. The numerous bad unwholesome qualities that originate with longing as condition: these are harmful. The numerous wholesome qualities that reach fulfillment by development with nonlonging as condition: these are beneficial.

(9) "Ill will is non-Dhamma; good will is the Dhamma. The numerous bad unwholesome qualities that originate with ill will as condition: these are harmful. The numerous wholesome qualities that reach fulfillment by development with good will as condition: these are beneficial.

(10) "Wrong view is non-Dhamma; right view is the Dhamma. The numerous bad unwholesome qualities that originate with wrong view as condition: these are harmful. The numerous wholesome qualities that reach fulfillment by development with right view as condition: these are beneficial.

"Friends, [259] it is in this way that I understand the detailed meaning of the Blessed One's brief synopsis. Now, if you wish, you may go to the Blessed One himself and ask him about the meaning of this. You should retain it in mind as the Blessed One explains it to you."

"Yes, friend," those bhikkhus replied, and having delighted and rejoiced in the Venerable Mahākaccāna's statement, they rose from their seats and went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to him, they sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, the Blessed One taught this synopsis.... [260] [they here relate all that had taken place, adding:] ... Then, Bhante, we approached the Venerable Mahākaccāna and asked him about the meaning. The Venerable Mahākaccāna expounded the meaning to us in these ways, in these terms and phrases."
"Good, good, bhikkhus! Mahākaccāna is wise. Mahākaccāna has great wisdom. If you had approached me and asked me the meaning of this, I would have explained it to you in the same way as Mahākaccāna. Such is the meaning of this, and so you should retain it in mind."

# 173 (7) Non-Dhamma (3)

"Bhikkhus, what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma should be understood, and what is harmful and what is beneficial should also be understood. Having understood what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma, and also what is harmful and what is beneficial, one should practice in accordance with the Dhamma and with what is beneficial:

"And what, bhikkhus, is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma? And what is harmful and what is beneficial?

(1) "The destruction of life is non-Dhamma; abstention from the destruction of life is the Dhamma. The numerous bad unwholesome qualities that originate with the destruction of life as condition: these are harmful. The numerous wholesome qualities that reach fulfillment by development with abstention from the destruction of life as condition: these are beneficial.

(2) "Taking what is not given is non-Dhamma; abstention from taking what is not given is the Dhamma. . . (3) Sexual misconduct [261] is non-Dhamma; abstention from sexual misconduct is the Dhamma. . . (4) False speech is non-Dhamma; abstention from false speech is the Dhamma. . . (5) Divisive speech is non-Dhamma; abstention from divisive speech is the Dhamma....(6) Harsh speech is non-Dhamma; abstention from harsh speech is the Dhamma....(7) Idle chatter is non-Dhamma; abstention from idle chatter is the Dhamma.... (8) Longing is non-Dhamma; non-longing is the Dhamma....(9) Ill will is nonDhamma; good will is the Dhamma....

(10) "Wrong view is non-Dhamma; right view is the Dhamma. The numerous bad unwholesome qualities that originate with wrong view as condition: these are harmful. The numerous wholesome qualities that reach fulfillment by development with right view as condition: these are beneficial.

"When it was said: 'Bhikkhus, what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma should be understood, and what is harmful and what is beneficial should be understood. Having understood
what is non-Dhamma and what is the Dhamma, and what is harmful and what is beneficial, one should practice in accordance with the Dhamma and with what is beneficial,' it is with reference to this that this was said."

# 174 (8) Causes of Kamma

"Bhikkhus, the destruction of life, I say, is threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Taking what is not given, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Sexual misconduct, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. False speech, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Divisive speech, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Harsh speech, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Idle chatter, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Longing, [262] I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Ill will, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Wrong view, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion.

"Thus, bhikkhus, greed is a source and origin of kamma; hatred is a source and origin of kamma; delusion is a source and origin of kamma. With the destruction of greed, a source of kamma is extinguished. With the destruction of hatred, a source of kamma is extinguished. With the destruction of delusion, a source of kamma is extinguished."

## 175 (9) Avoidance

"Bhikkhus, this Dhamma offers a means of avoidance. It does not lack a means of avoidance. And how does this Dhamma offer a means of avoidance and not lack a means of avoidance?

(1) "One who destroys life has abstention from the destruction of life as the means to avoid it. (2) One who takes what is not given has abstention from taking what is not given as the means to avoid it. (3) One who engages in sexual misconduct has abstention from sexual misconduct as the means to avoid it. (4) One who speaks falsely has abstention from false speech as the means to avoid it. (5) One who speaks divisively has
abstention from divisive speech as the means to avoid it. (6) One who speaks harshly has abstention from harsh speech as the means to avoid it. (7) One who indulges in idle chatter has abstention from idle chatter as the means to avoid it. (8) One full of longing has non-longing as the means to avoid it. (9) One full of ill will has good will as the means to avoid it. (10) One who holds wrong view has right view as the means to avoid it.

"It is in this way, bhikkhus, that this Dhamma offers a means of avoidance and does not lack a means of avoidance." [263]

# 176 (10) Cunda

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Pāvā in the mango grove of Cunda, the smith's son. ${ }^{2165}$ Then Cunda, the smith's son, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Cunda, whose rites of purity ${ }^{2166}$ do you prefer?"

"Bhante, I prefer the rites of purity prescribed by the brahmins of the west who carry around waterpots, wear garlands of water plants, tend the sacred fire, and immerse themselves in water."

"And how, Cunda, do the brahmins of the west prescribe their rites of purity?"

"Here, Bhante, the brahmins of the west enjoin a disciple thus: 'Come, good man, having gotten up early, you should stroke the ground from your bed. If you don't stroke the ground, you should stroke wet cow dung. If you don't stroke wet cow dung, you should stroke green grass. If you don't stroke green grass, you should tend the sacred fire. If you don't tend the sacred fire, you should pay homage to the sun with reverential salutation. If you don't pay homage to the sun with reverential salutation, you should immerse yourself in water three times including the evening.' It is in this way that the brahmins of the west prescribe their rites of purity. It is their rites of purity that I prefer."

"Cunda, purification in the Noble One's discipline is quite different from the rites of purity prescribed by the brahmins of the west who carry around waterpots, wear garlands of water plants, tend the sacred fire, and immerse themselves in water." [264]

"But how, Bhante, does purification come about in the Noble

One's discipline? It would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in a way that explains how purification comes about in the Noble One's discipline."

"Well then, Cunda, listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," Cunda, the smith's son, replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Impurity by body, Cunda, is threefold. Impurity by speech is fourfold. Impurity by mind is threefold.

"And how, Cunda, is impurity by body threefold?

(1) "Here, someone destroys life. He is murderous, bloodyhanded, given to blows and violence, merciless to living beings.

(2) "He takes what is not given. He steals the wealth and property of others in the village or forest.

(3) "He engages in sexual misconduct. He has sexual relations with women who are protected by their mother, father, mother and father, brother, sister, or relatives; who are protected by their Dhamma; who have a husband; whose violation entails a penalty; or even with one already engaged. ${ }^{2167}$

"It is in this way that impurity by body is threefold.

"And how, Cunda, is impurity by speech fourfold?

(4) "Here, someone speaks falsehood. If he is summoned to a council, to an assembly, to his relatives' presence, to his guild, or to the court, and questioned as a witness thus: 'So, good man, tell what you know,' then, not knowing, he says, 'I know,' or knowing, he says, 'I do not know'; not seeing, he says, 'I see,' or seeing, he says, 'I do not see.' Thus [265] he consciously speaks falsehood for his own ends, or for another's ends, or for some trifling worldly end.

(5) "He speaks divisively. Having heard something here, he repeats it elsewhere in order to divide [those people] from these; or having heard something elsewhere, he repeats it to these people in order to divide [them] from those. Thus he is one who divides those who are united, a creator of divisions, one who enjoys factions, rejoices in factions, delights in factions, a speaker of words that create factions.

(6) "He speaks harshly. He utters such words as are rough, hard, hurtful to others, offensive to others, bordering on anger, unconducive to concentration.

(7) "He indulges in idle chatter. He speaks at an improper
time, speaks falsely, speaks what is unbeneficial, speaks contrary to the Dhamma and the discipline; at an improper time he speaks such words as are worthless, unreasonable, rambling, and unbeneficial.

"It is in this way that impurity by speech is fourfold.

"And how, Cunda, is impurity by mind threefold?

(8) "Here, someone is full of longing. He longs for the wealth and property of others thus: 'Oh, may what belongs to another be mine!'

(9) "He has a mind of ill will and intentions of hate thus: 'May these beings be slain, slaughtered, ${ }^{2168}$ cut off, destroyed, or annihilated!'

(10) "He holds wrong view and has an incorrect perspective thus: 'There is nothing given, nothing sacrificed, nothing offered; there is no fruit or result of good and bad actions; there is no this world, no other world; there is no mother, no father; there are no beings spontaneously reborn; there are in the world no ascetics and brahmins of right conduct and right practice who, having realized this world and the other world for themselves by direct knowledge, make them known to others.'

"It is in this way that impurity by mind is threefold. [266]

"These, Cunda, are the ten courses of unwholesome kamma. If one engages in these ten courses of unwholesome kamma, then, if one gets up early and strokes the ground from one's bed, one is impure, and if one doesn't stroke the ground, one is impure. If one strokes wet cow dung, one is impure, and if one doesn't stroke wet cow dung, one is impure. If one strokes green grass, one is impure, and if one doesn't stroke green grass, one is impure. If one tends the sacred fire, one is impure, and if one doesn't tend the sacred fire, one is impure. If one pays homage to the sun with reverential salutation, one is impure, and if one doesn't pay homage to the sun with reverential salutation, one is impure. If one immerses oneself in water three times including the evening, one is impure, and if one doesn't immerse oneself in water three times including the evening, one is impure. For what reason? Because these ten courses of unwholesome kamma are themselves impure and defiling. It is because people engage in these ten courses of unwholesome kamma that hell, the animal realm, the sphere of afflicted spirits, and other bad destinations are seen.
"Purity by body, Cunda, is threefold. Purity by speech is fourfold. Purity by mind is threefold.

"And how, Cunda, is purity by body threefold?

(1) "Here, someone, having abandoned the destruction of life, abstains from the destruction of life. With the rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious and kindly, he dwells compassionate toward all living beings.

(2) "Having abandoned the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what is not given. He does not steal the wealth and property of others in the village or in the forest.

(3) "Having abandoned sexual misconduct, he abstains from sexual misconduct. He does not have sexual relations with women who are protected by their mother, father, mother and father, brother, sister, or relatives; who are protected by their Dhamma; who have a husband; whose violation entails a penalty; [267] or even with one already engaged.

"It is in this way that purity by body is threefold.

"And how, Cunda, is purity by speech fourfold?

(4) "Here, someone, having abandoned false speech, abstains from false speech. If he is summoned to a council, to an assembly, to his relatives' presence, to his guild, or to the court, and questioned as a witness thus: 'So, good man, tell what you know,' then, not knowing, he says, 'I do not know,' or knowing, he says, 'I know'; not seeing, he says, 'I do not see,' or seeing, he says, 'I see.' Thus he does not consciously speak falsehood for his own ends, or for another's ends, or for some trifling worldly end.

(5) "Having abandoned divisive speech, he abstains from divisive speech. Having heard something here, he does not repeat it elsewhere in order to divide [those people] from these; or having heard something elsewhere, he does not repeat it to these people in order to divide [them] from'those. Thus he is one who reunites those who are divided, a promoter of unity, who enjoys concord, rejoices in concord, delights in concord, a speaker of words that promote concord.

(6) "Having abandoned harsh speech, he abstains from harsh speech. He speaks such words as are gentle, pleasing to the ear, and lovable, as go to the heart, are courteous, desired by many, and agreeable to many.

(7) "Having abandoned idle chatter, he abstains from idle
chatter. He speaks at a proper time, speaks truth, speaks what is beneficial, speaks on the Dhamma and the discipline; at a proper time he speaks such words as are worth recording, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.

"It is in this way that purity by speech is fourfold.

"And how, Cunda, is purity by mind threefold?

(8) "Here, someone is without longing. He does not long for the wealth and property of others thus: 'Oh, may what belongs to another be mine!'

(9) "He is of good will and his intentions are free of hate thus: 'May these beings live happily, free from enmity, affliction, and anxiety!'

(10) "He holds right view [268] and has a correct perspective thus: 'There is what is given, sacrificed, and offered; there is fruit and result of good and bad actions; there is this world and the other world; there is mother and father; there are beings. spontaneously reborn; there are in the world ascetics and brahmins of right conduct and right practice who, having realized this world and the other world for themselves by direct knowledge, make them known to others.'

"It is in this way that purity by mind is threefold."

"These, Cunda, are the ten courses of wholesome kamma. If one engages in these ten courses of wholesome kamma, then, if one gets up early and strokes the ground from one's bed, one is pure, and if one doesn't stroke the ground, one is pure. If one strokes wet cow dung, one is pure, and if one doesn't stroke wet cow dung, one is pure. If one strokes green grass, one is pure, and if one doesn't stroke green grass, one is pure. If one tends the sacred fire, one is pure, and if one doesn't tend the sacred fire, one is pure. If one pays homage to the sun with reverential salutation, one is pure, and if one doesn't pay homage to the sun with reverential salutation; one is pure. If one immerses oneself in water three times including the evening, one is pure, and if one doesn't immerse oneself in water three times including the evening, one is pure. For what reason? Because these ten courses of wholesome kamma are themselves pure and purifying. It is because people engage in these ten courses of wholesome kamma that the devas, human beings, and other good destinations are seen."

When this was said, Cunda, the smith's son, said to the Blessed One: "Excellent, Bhante! . . . Let the Blessed One accept
me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life." [269]

# 177 (11) Jannussonī

Then the brahmin Jāṇussonī approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

"Master Gotama, we brahmins give gifts and perform the memorial rites for the dead ${ }^{2169}$ with the thought: 'Let our gift be of benefit to our departed relatives and family members. Let our departed relatives and family members partake of our gift.' Can our gift, Master Gotama, actually be of benefit to our departed relatives and family members? Can our departed relatives and family members actually partake of our gift?"

"On a right occasion, brahmin, it can be of benefit, not on a wrong occasion."

"But, Master Gotama, what is a right occasion and what is a wrong occasion?"

"Here, brahmin, someone destroys life, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, speaks falsehood, speaks divisively, 'speaks harshly, indulges in idle chatter; he is full of longing, has a mind of ill will, and holds wrong view. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in hell. ${ }^{2170}$ He sustains himself and subsists there on the food of the hell-beings. This is a wrong occasion, when the gift is not of benefit to one living there.

"Someone else destroys life . . . and holds wrong view. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the animal realm. He sustains himself and subsists there on the food of animals. This, too, is a wrong occasion, when the gift is not of benefit to one living there.

"Still another abstains from the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, from divisive [270] speech, from harsh speech, from idle chatter; he is without longing, of good will, and holds right view. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with human beings. He sustains himself and subsists there on the food of human beings. This, too, is a wrong occasion, when the gift is not of benefit to one living there.

"Still another abstains from the destruction of life . . . and
holds right view. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with the devas. He sustains himself and subsists there on the food of devas. This, too, is a wrong occasion, when the gift is not of benefit to one living there.

"Still another destroys life . . . and holds wrong view. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the sphere of afflicted spirits. He sustains himself and subsists there on the food of afflicted spirits, or else he sustains himself there on what his friends, companions, relatives, or family members in this world offer to him. This is a right occasion, when the gift is of benefit to one living there."

"But, Master Gotama, who partakes of the gift if that deceased relative or family member has not been reborn in that place?"

"Other departed relatives or family members who have been reborn ${ }^{2171}$ in that place partake of the gift."

"But, Master Gotama, who partakes of the gift if neither that deceased relative or family member nor any others have been reborn in that place?"

"Over this long stretch of time [in samsāra], brahmin, it is impossible and inconceivable for that place to be devoid of [271] one's departed relatives and family members. Further, for the donor too it is not fruitless."

"Does Master Gotama posit [the value of giving] even on the wrong occasion?"2172

"Brahmin, I posit [the value of giving] even on the wrong occasion.

"Here, brahmin, someone destroys life, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, speaks falsehood, speaks divisively, speaks harshly, indulges in idle chatter; he is full of longing, has a mind of ill will, and holds wrong view. He gives an ascetic or a brahmin food and drink; clothing and a vehicle; garlands, scents, and unguents; bedding, dwellings, and lighting. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with elephants. There he gains food and drink, garlands and various ornaments.

"Since he here destroyed life ... and held wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with elephants. But since he gave an ascetic or a brahmin food and drink ... he there gains food and drink, garlands and various ornaments.
"Someone else destroys life . . . and holds wrong view. He gives an ascetic or a brahmin food and drink . . . and lighting. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with horses . . . cattle . . . dogs. There he gains food and drink, garlands and various ornaments.

"Since he here destroyed life . . . [272] . . . and held wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with horses . . . cattle . . . dogs. But since he gave an ascetic or a brahmin food and drink . . . he there gains food and drink, garlands and various ornaments.

"Still another abstains from the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, from divisive speech, from harsh speech, from idle chatter; he is without longing, of good will, and holds right view. He gives an ascetic or a brahmin food and drink; clothing and a vehicle; garlands, scents; and unguients; bedding, dwellings, and lighting. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with human beings. There he gains the five objects of human sensual pleasure.

"Since he here abstained from the destruction of life . . . and held right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with human beings. And since he gave an ascetic or a brahmin food and drink . . . he there gains the five objects of human sensual pleasure.

"Still another abstains from the destruction of life . . . and holds right view. He gives an ascetic or a brahmin food and drink ... and lighting. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with the devas. There [273] he gains the five objects of celestial sensual pleasure.

"Since he here abstained from the destruction of life . . . and held right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with the devas. And since he gave an ascetic or a brahmin food and drink . . . he there gains the five objects of celestial sensual pleasure. [That is why I said:] 'Further, for the donor too it is not fruitless."

"It's astounding and amazing, Master Gotama, that there is reason to give gifts and perform the memorial rites for the dead, since for the donor too it is not fruitless."

"So it is, brahmin! So it is, brahmin! For the donor too it is not fruitless."
"Excellent, Master Gotama! . . . Let Master Gotama accept me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

# III. GOOD ${ }^{2173}$

178 (1) Good

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you what is good and what is bad. Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, [274] Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

211 (1) Hell (1)

"Bhikkhus, possessing ten qualities, one is deposited in hell as if brought there. What ten?

(1) "Here, someone destroys life; he is murderous, bloodyhanded, given to blows and violence, merciless to living beings.

(2) "He takes what is not given; he steals the wealth and property of others in the village or forest.

(3) "He engages in sexual misconduct; he has sexual relations
with women who are protected by their mother, father, mother and father, brother, sister, or relatives; who are protected by their Dhamma; who have a husband; whose violation entails a penalty; or even with one already engaged.

(4) "He speaks falsehood. If he is summoned to a council, to an assembly, to his relatives' presence, to his guild, or to the court, and questioned as a witness thus: 'So, good man, tell what you know,' then, not knowing, he says, 'I know,' or knowing, he says, 'I do not know'; not seeing, he says, 'I see,' or seeing, he says, 'I do not see.' Thus he consciously speaks falsehood for his own ends, or for another's ends, or for some trifling worldly end.

(5) "He speaks divisively. Having heard something here, he repeats it elsewhere in order to divide [those people] from these; or having heard something elsewhere, he repeats it to these people in order to divide [them] from those. Thus he is one who divides those who are united, a creator of divisions, one who enjoys factions, rejoices in factions, delights in factions, a speaker of words that create factions.

(6) "He speaks harshly. He utters such words as are rough, hard, hurtful to others, offensive to others, bordering on anger, unconducive to concentration.

(7) "He indulges in idle chatter. He speaks at an improper time, speaks falsely, speaks what is unbeneficial, speaks contrary to the Dhamma and the discipline; at an improper time he speaks such words as are worthless, unreasonable, rambling, and unbeneficial. [284]

(8) "He is full of longing. He longs for the wealth and property of others thus: 'Oh, may what belongs to another be mine!'

(9) "He has a mind of ill will and intentions of hate thus: 'May these beings be slain, slaughtered, cut off, destroyed, or annihilated!'

(10) "He holds wrong view and has an incorrect perspective thus: 'There is nothing given, nothing sacrificed, nothing offered; there is no fruit or result of good and bad actions; there is no this world, no other world; there is no mother, no father; there are no beings spontaneously reborn; there are in the world no ascetics and brahmins of right conduct and right practice who, having realized this world and the other world for themselves by direct knowledge, make them known to others.'
"One possessing these ten qualities is deposited in hell as if brought there.

"Bhikkhus, one possessing ten qualities is deposited in heaven as if brought there. What ten?

(1) "Here, someone, having abandoned the destruction of life, abstains from the destruction of life. With the rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious and kindly, he dwells compassionate toward all living beings.

(2) "Having abandoned the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what is not given. He does not steal the wealth and property of others in the village or in the forest.

(3) "Having abandoned sexual misconduct, he abstains from sexual misconduct. He does not have sexual relations with women who are protected by their mother, father, mother and father, brother, sister, or relatives; who are protected by their Dhamma; who have a husband; whose violation entails a penalty; or even with one already engaged.

(4) "Having abandoned false speech, he abstains from false speech. If he is summoned to a council, to an assembly, to his relatives' presence, to his guild, or to the court, and questioned as a witness thus: 'So, good man, tell what you know,' then, not knowing, he says, 'I do not know,' or knowing, he says, 'I know'; not seeing, he says, 'I do not see,' or seeing, he says, 'I see.' Thus he does not consciously speak falsehood for his own ends, or for another's ends, or for some trifling worldly end. [285]

(5) "Having abandoned divisive speech, he abstains from divisive speech. Having heard something here, he does not repeat it elsewhere in order to divide [those people] from these; or having heard something elsewhere, he does not repeat it to these people in order to divide [them] from those. Thus he is one who reunites those who are divided, a promoter of unity, who enjoys concord, rejoices in concord, delights in concord, a speaker of words that promote concord.

(6) "Having abandoned harsh speech, he abstains from harsh speech. He speaks such words as are gentle, pleasing to the ear, and lovable, as go to the heart, are courteous, desired by many, and agreeable to many.

(7) "Having abandoned idle chatter, he abstains from idle chatter. He speaks at a proper time, speaks truth, speaks what is beneficial, speaks on the Dhamma and the discipline; at a
proper time he speaks such words as are worth recording, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.

(8) "He is without longing. He does not long for the wealth and property of others thus: 'Oh, may what belongs to another be mine!'

(9) "He is of good will and his intentions are free of hate thus: 'May these beings live happily, free from enmity, affliction, and anxiety!'

(10) "He holds right view and has a correct perspective thus: 'There is what is given, sacrificed, and offered; there is fruit and result of good and bad actions; there is this world and the other world; there is mother and father; there are beings spontaneously reborn; there are in the world ascetics and brahmins of right conduct and right practice who, having realized this world and the other world for themselves by direct knowledge, make them known to others.'

# 216 (6) Creeping

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you an exposition of the Dhamma on creeping. ${ }^{2177}$ Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"And what, bhikkhus, is that exposition of the Dhamma on creeping? Bhikkhus, beings are the owners of their kamma, the heirs of their kamma; they have kamma as their origin, kamma as their relative, kamma as their resort; whatever kamma they do, good or bad, they are its heirs. [289]

(1) "Here, someone destroys life; he is murderous, bloody-. handed, given to blows and violence, merciless to living beings. He creeps along by body, speech, and mind. ${ }^{2178}$ His bodily kamma is crooked; his verbal kamma is crooked; his mental kamma is crooked. His destination is crooked; his rebirth is crooked. But for one with a crooked destination and rebirth, I say, there is one of two destinations: either the exclusively painful hells or a species of creeping animal. And what are the species of creeping animals? The snake, the scorpion, the centipede, the mongoose, the cat, the mouse, and the owl, ${ }^{2179}$ or any other animals that creep away when they see people. Thus a being is reborn from a being; one is reborn through one's deeds. When one has been reborn, contacts affect one. It is in this way, I say, that beings are the heirs of their kamma.

(2) "Someone takes what is not given ... (3) . . . engages in sexual misconduct . . (4) . . speaks falsehood . . (5) . . . speaks divisively . . (6) . . . speaks harshly . . (7) . . . indulges in idle chatter... (8) ... is full of longing ... (9) ... has a mind of ill will and intentions of hate ... (10) ... holds wrong view and has an incorrect perspective thus: 'There is nothing given ... there are in the world no ascetics and brahmins of right conduct and right practice who, having realized this world and the other
world for themselves by direct knowledge, make them known to others.' He creeps along by body, speech, and mind. His bodily kamma is crooked . . . His destination is crooked; [290] his rebirth is crooked. . . Thus a being is reborn from a being; one is reborn through one's deeds. When one has been reborn, contacts affect one. It is in this way, I say, that beings are the heirs of their kamma.

"Bhikkhus, beings are the owners of their kamma, the heirs of their kamma; they have kamma as their origin, kamma as their relative, kamma as their resort; whatever kamma they do, good or bad, they are its heirs.

(1) "Here, having abandoned the destruction of life, someone abstains from the destruction of life; with the rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious and kindly, he dwells compassionate toward all living beings. He does not creep along by body, speech, and mind. His bodily kamma is straight; his verbal kamma is straight; his mental kamma is straight. His destination is straight; his rebirth is straight. But for one with a straight destination and rebirth, I say, there is one of two destinations: either the exclusively pleasant heavens or eminent families, such as those of affluent khattiyas, affluent brahmins, or affluent householders, [families that are] rich, with great wealth and property, abundant gold and silver, abundant treasures and belongings, abundant wealth and grain. Thus a being is reborn from a being; one is reborn through one's deeds. When one has been reborn, contacts affect one. It is in this way, I say, that beings are the heirs of their kamma.

(2) "Having abandoned the taking of what is not given, someone abstains from taking what is not given...(3)...abstains from sexual misconduct . . . [291] (4) . . . abstains from false speech . . . (5) ...abstains from divisive speech ...(6)...abstains from harsh speech ...(7) . . . abstains from idle chatter . . (8) . . . is without longing ... (9) . . . is of good will ... (10) ... holds right view and has a correct perspective thus: 'There is what is given ... there are in the world ascetics and brahmins of right conduct and right practice who, having realized this world and the other world for themselves by direct knowledge, make them known to others.' He does not creep along by body, speech, and mind. His bodily kamma is straight . . . His destination is straight; his rebirth is straight. . . . Thus a being is reborn from a being; one is reborn through one's deeds. When one has been reborn,
contacts affect one. It is in this way, I say, that beings are the heirs of their kamma.

"Bhikkhus, beings are the owners of their kamma, the heirs of their kamma; they have kamma as their origin, kamma as their relative, kamma as their resort; whatever kamma they do, good or bad, they are its heirs.

"This, bhikkhus, is that exposition of the Dhamma on creeping." [292]

# 217 (7) Volitional (1)

But I do not say that there is making an end of suffering so long as one has not experienced [the results of] volitional kamma that has been done and accumulated. ${ }^{2181}$

"As to this, bhikkhus, there is a threefold corruption and failure of bodily kamma, ${ }^{2182}$ arisen from unwholesome volition, having a painful outcome and result; a fourfold corruption and failure of verbal kamma, arisen from unwholesome volition, having a painful outcome and result; and a threefold corruption and failure of mental kamma, arisen from unwholesome volition, having a painful outcome and result.

"This noble disciple, bhikkhus, who is thus devoid of longing, devoid of ill will, unconfused, clearly comprehending, ever mindful, dwells pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with compassion . . . with a mind imbued with altruistic joy ... with a mind imbued with equanimity, likewise the second quarter, the third quarter, and the fourth quarter. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with equanimity, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will.

"What do you think, bhikkhus, if a youth would develop the liberation of mind by equanimity, from his childhood on, would he do a bad deed?"

"No, Bhante."

"No, Bhante. For on what account could suffering affect one who does no bad deed?"

"A woman or a man should develop this liberation of mind by equanimity. A woman or a man cannot take this body with them when they go. Mortals have mind as their core.

When the liberation of mind by equanimity has been developed in this way, it leads to nonreturning for a wise bhikkhu here who does not penetrate to a further liberation."

# 220 (10) Conduct Contrary to the Dhamma

Then a certain brahmin approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had exchanged greetings and cordial talk; he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

"Master Gotama, why is it that some beings here, with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell?"

"It is, brahmin, because of unrighteous conduct, conduct contrary to the Dhamma, that some beings here, with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.

"Master Gotama, why is it that some beings here, [302] with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world?"

"It is, brahmin, because of righteous conduct, conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, that some beings here, with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world."

"I do not understand in detail the meaning of Master Gotama's statement that he has spoken in brief. Please let Master Gotama teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might understand the meaning in detail."

"Well then, brahmin, listen and attend closely. I will speak."
"Yes, sir," that brahmin replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Brahmin, unrighteous conduct, conduct contrary to the Dhamma, is threefold by way of the body, fourfold by way of speech, and threefold by way of the mind.

"And how, brahmin, is unrighteous conduct, conduct contrary to the Dhamma, threefold by way of the body? . . [here and below, the explanations are as in 10:217]... It is in this way that unrighteous conduct, conduct contrary to the Dhamma, is threefold by way of the mind.

"It is, brahmin, because of such unrighteous conduct, conduct contrary to the Dhamma, that some beings here, with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.

"Brahmin, righteous conduct, conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, is threefold by way of the body, fourfold by way of speech, and threefold by way of the mind:

"And how, brahmin, is righteous conduct, conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, threefold by way of the body? . . [303] ...It is in this way that righteous conduct, conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, is threefold by way of the mind.

"It is, brahmin, because of such righteous conduct, conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, that some beings here, with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.

"Excellent, Master Gotama! . . . Let Master Gotama accept me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

# [311] The Book of the Elevens

## Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One

## I. DEPENDENCE

## 1 (1) What Purpose? ${ }^{2199}$

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇ̣ika's Park. Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

(1) "Bhante, what is the purpose and benefit of wholesome virtuous behavior?"

(2) "Ānanda, the purpose and benefit of wholesome virtuous behavior is non-regret."

(3) "And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of nonregret?"

"The purpose and benefit of non-regret is joy."

(4) "And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of joy?"

"The purpose and benefit of joy is rapture."

(5) "And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of rapture?"

"The purpose and benefit of rapture is tranquility."

(6) "And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of tranquility?"

"The purpose and benefit of tranquility is pleasure."

(7) "And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of pleasure?"

"The purpose and benefit of pleasure is concentration."

(8) "And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of concentration?"

"The purpose and benefit of concentration is the knowledge and vision of things as they really are."
(9) "And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of the knowledge and vision of things as they really are?"

"The purpose and benefit of the knowledge and vision of things as they really are is disenchantment."

(10) And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of disenchantment?"

"The purpose and benefit of disenchantment is dispassion." [312]

(11) "And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of dispassion?"

"The purpose and benefit of dispassion is the knowledge and vision of liberation."

"Thus, Ānanda, (1)-(2) the purpose and benefit of wholesome virtuous behavior is non-regret; (3) the purpose and benefit of non-regret is joy; (4) the purpose and benefit of joy is rapture; (5) the purpose and benefit of rapture is tranquility; (6) the purpose and benefit of tranquility is pleasure; (7) the purpose and benefit of pleasure is concentration; (8) the purpose and benefit of concentration is the knowledge and vision of things as they really are; (9) the purpose and benefit of the knowledge and vision of things as they really are is disenchantment; (10) the purpose and benefit of disenchantment is dispassion; and (10) the purpose and benefit of dispassion is the knowledge and vision of liberation. Thus, Ānanda, wholesome virtuous behavior progressively leads to the foremost."

# 2 (2) Volition ${ }^{2200}$

(1)-(2) "Bhikkhus, for a virtuous person, one whose behavior is virtuous, no volition need be exerted: 'Let non-regret arise in me.' It is natural that non-regret arises in one who is virtuous, one whose behavior is virtuous.

(3) "For one without regret no volition need be exerted: 'Let joy arise in me.' It is natural that joy arises in one without regret.

(4) "For one who is joyful no volition need be exerted: 'Let rapture arise in me.' It is natural that rapture arises in one who is joyful.

(5) "For one with a rapturous mind no volition need be exerted: 'Let my body become tranquil.' It is natural that the body of one with a rapturous mind is tranquil.
(6) "For one tranquil in body no volition need be exerted: 'Let me feel pleasure.' It is natural that one tranquil in body feels pleasure.

(7) "For one feeling pleasure no volition need be exerted: 'Let my mind be concentrated.' It is natural that the mind of one feeling pleasure is concentrated.

(8) "For one who is concentrated no volition need be exerted: 'Let me know and see things as they really are.' It is natural [313] that one who is concentrated knows and sees things as they really are.

(9) "For one who knows and sees things as they really are no volition need be exerted: 'Let me be disenchanted.' It is natural that one who knows and sees things as they really are is disenchanted.

(10) "For one who is disenchanted no volition need be exerted: 'Let me become dispassionate.' It is natural that one who is disenchanted becomes dispassionate.

(11) "For one who is dispassionate no volition need be exerted: 'Let me realize the knowledge and vision of liberation.' It is natural that one who is dispassionate realizes the knowledge and vision of liberation.

"Thus, bhikkhus, (11)-(10) the knowledge and vision of liberation is the purpose and benefit of dispassion; (9) dispassion is the purpose and benefit of disenchantment; (8) disenchantment is the purpose and benefit of the knowledge and vision of things as they really are; (7) the knowledge and vision of things as they really are is the purpose and benefit of concentration; (6) concentration is the purpose and benefit of pleasure; (5) pleasure is the purpose and benefit of tranquility; (4) tranquility is the purpose and benefit of rapture; (3) rapture is the purpose and benefit of joy; (2) joy is the purpose and benefit of non-regret; and (1) nonregret is the purpose and benefit of virtuous behavior.

"Thus, bhikkhus, one stage flows into the next stage, one stage fills up the next stage, for going from the near shore to the far shore."

# 3 (3) Proximate Cause (1) ${ }^{2201}$

"Bhikkhus, (1) for an immoral person, for one deficient in virtuous behavior, (2) non-regret lacks its proximate cause. When there is no non-regret, for one deficient in non-regret, (3) joy
lacks its proximate cause. When there is no joy, for one deficient in joy, (4) rapture lacks its proximate cause. When there is no rapture, for one deficient in rapture, (5) tranquility lacks its proximate cause. When there is no tranquility, for one deficient in tranquility, [314] (6) pleasure lacks its proximate cause. When there is no pleasure, for one deficient in pleasure, (7) right concentration lacks its proximate cause. When there is no right concentration, for one deficient in right concentration, (8) the knowledge and vision of things as they really are lacks its proximate cause. When there is no knowledge and vision of things as they really are, for one deficient in the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, (9) disenchantment lacks its proximate cause. When there is no disenchantment, for one deficient in disenchantment, (10) dispassion lacks its proximate cause. When there is no dispassion, for one deficient in dispassion, (11) the knowledge and vision of liberation lacks its proximate cause:

"Suppose there is a tree deficient in branches and foliage. Then its shoots do not grow to fullness; also its bark, softwood, and heartwood do not grow to fullness. So too, for an immoral person, one deficient in virtuous behavior, non-regret lacks its proximate cause. When there is no non-regret... the knowledge and vision of liberation lacks its proximate cause.

"Bhikkhus, (1) for a virtuous person, for one whose behavior is virtuous, (2) non-regret possesses its proximate cause. When there is non-regret, for one possessing non-regret, (3) joy possesses its proximate cause. When there is joy, for one possessing joy, (4) rapture possesses its proximate cause. When there is rapture, for one possessing rapture, (5) tranquility possesses its proximate cause. When there is tranquility, for one possessing tranquility, (6) pleasure possesses its proximate cause. When there is pleasure, for one possessing pleasure, (7) right concentration possesses its proximate cause. When there is right concentration, for one possessing right concentration, (8) the knowledge and vision of things as they really are possesses its proximate cause. When there is the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, for one possessing the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, (9) disenchantment possesses its proximate cause. When there is disenchantment, for one possessing disenchantment, (10) dispassion possesses its
proximate cause. When there is dispassion, for one possessing dispassion, (11) the knowledge and vision of liberation possesses its proximate cause.

"Suppose there is a tree possessing branches and foliage. Then its shoots grow to fullness; also its bark, softwood, and heartwood grow to fullness. So too, for a virtuous person, one whose behavior is virtuous, non-regret possesses its proximate cause. When there is non-regret ... the knowledge and vision of liberation possesses its proximate cause." [315]

# 4 (4) Proximate Cause (2)

There the Venerable Sāriputta addresseci the dükknus:

[Identical with 11:3, but spoken by Säriputta.] [316]

## 5 (5) Proximate Cause (3)

There the Venerable Ānanda addressed the bhikkhus:

[Identical with 11:3, but spoken by Ānanda.] [317]

## 6 (6) Disaster ${ }^{2202}$

"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is one who insults and disparages his fellow monks, a reviler of the noble ones, it is impossible and inconceivable that he will not incur at least one of these eleven disasters. What eleven? (1) He does not achieve what he has not yet achieved. (2) He falls away from what he has achieved. (3) His good qualities are not polished. ${ }^{2203}$ (4) He overestimates his good qualities, or (5) leads the spiritual life dissatisfied, [318] or (6) commits a defiled offense, or (7) gives up the training and reverts to the lower life, (8) or contracts a severe illness, or (9) goes mad and becomes mentally deranged. (10) He dies confused. (11) With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. When a bhikkhu is one who insults and disparages his fellow monks, a reviler of the noble ones, it is impossible and inconceivable that he will not incur at least one of these eleven disasters."

## 7 (7) Perception ${ }^{2204}$

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, could a bhikkhu obtain such a state of concentration
that (1) he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth; (2) of water in relation to water; (3) of fire in relation to fire; (4) of air in relation to air; (5) of the base of the infinity of space in relation to the base of the infinity of space; (6) of the base of the infinity of consciousness in relation to the base of the infinity of consciousness; (7) of the base of nothingness in relation to the base of nothingness; (8) of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in relation to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; (9) of this world in relation to this world; (10) of the other world in relation to the other world; (11) of anything seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, and examined by the mind, but he would still be percipient?"

"He could, Ānanda." [319]

"But how, Bhante, could he obtain such a state of concentration?"

"Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu is percipient thus: 'This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, the stilling of all activities, the relinquishing of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, nibbāna.' It is in this way, Ānanda, that a bhikkhu could obtain such a state of concentration that he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth; of water in relation to water; of fire in relation to fire; of air in relation to air; of the base of the infinity of space in relation to the base of the infinity of space; of the base of the infinity of consciousness in relation to the base of the infinity of consciousness; of the base of nothingness in relation to the base of nothingness; of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in relation to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; of this world in relation to this world; of the other world in relation to the other world; of anything seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, and examined by the mind, but he would still be percipient."

Then the Venerable Ānanda, having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One's statement, got up from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, [320] circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and approached the Venerable Sāriputta. ${ }^{2205}$ He exchanged greetings with the Venerable Sāriputta, and when they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to him:

"Friend Sāriputta, could a bhikkhu obtain such a state of concentration that he would not be percipient of earth in relation
to earth ... of anything seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, and examined by the mind, but he would still be percipient?"

"He could, friend Ānanda."

"But how, friend Sāriputta, could he obtain such a state of concentration?"

"Here, friend Ānanda, a bhikkhu is percipient thus: 'This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, the stilling of all activities, the relinquishing of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, nibbāna.' It is in this way, friend Ānanda, that a bhikkhu could obtain such a state of concentration that he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth... he would not be percipient of anything seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, examined by the mind, but he would still be percipient."

"It's astounding and amazing, friend, that the meaning and the phrasing of both teacher and disciple coincide and agree with each other and do not diverge in regard to the foremost state. ${ }^{2206}$ Just now, friend, I approached the Blessed One [321] and asked him about this matter. The Blessed One answered me in exactly the same terms and phrases that the Venerable Sāriputta used. It's astounding and amazing, friend, that the meaning and the phrasing of both teacher and disciple coincide and agree with each other and do not diverge in regard to the foremost state."

# 8 (8) Attention

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, could a bhikkhu obtain such a state of concentration that he would not attend to the eye and forms, the ear and sounds, the nose and odors, the tongue and tastes, the body and tactile objects; that (1) he would not attend to earth, ${ }^{2207}$ (2) water, (3) fire, (4) or air; (5) he would not attend to the base of the infinity of space, (6) the base of the infinity of consciousness, (7) the base of nothingness, (8) or the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; (9) he would not attend to this world; (10) he would not attend to the other world; (11) he would not attend to anything seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, and examined by the mind, but he would still be attentive?"

"He could, Ānanda." [322]
"But how, Bhante, could he obtain such a state of concentration?"

"Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu would attend thus: 'This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, the stilling of all activities, the relinquishing of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, nibbāna.' It is in this way, Ānanda, that a bhikkhu could obtain such a state of concentration that he would not attend to the eye and forms, the ear and sounds, the nose and odors, the tongue and tastes, the body and tactile objects; that he would not attend to earth, water, fire, or air; he would not attend to the base of the infinity of space, the base of the infinity of consciousness, the base of nothingness, or the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; he would not attend to this world; he would not attend to the other world; he would not attend to anything seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, and examined by the mind, but he would still be attentive."

# 9 (9) Sandha

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Nādika [323] in the brick hall. Then the Venérable Sandha ${ }^{2208}$ approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Meditate like a thoroughbred, Sandha, not like a wild colt. And how does a wild colt meditate? When a wild colt is tied up near the feeding trough he meditates: 'Fodder, fodder!' For what reason? Because when a wild colt is tied up by the feeding trough, he does not ask himself: 'Now what task will my trainer set for me today? What can I do to satisfy him?' Tied up by the feeding trough, he just meditates: 'Fodder, fodder!' So too, Sandha, a person who is like a wild colt, when gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, dwells with a mind obsessed and oppressed by sensual lust, and he does not understand as it really is the escape from arisen sensual lust. Harboring sensual lust within, he meditates, cogitates, ponders, and ruminates. ${ }^{2209} \mathrm{He}$ dwells with a mind obsessed and oppressed by ill will ... by dullness and drowsiness ... by restlessness and remorse ... by doubt, and he does not understand as it really is the escape from arisen doubt. Harboring doubt within, he meditates, cogitates, [324] ponders, and ruminates.
"He meditates (1) in dependence on earth, (2) in dependence on water, (3) in dependence on fire, (4) in dependence on air, (5) in dependence on the base of the infinity of space, (6) in dependence on the base of the infinity of consciousness, (7) in dependence on the base of nothingness, (8) in dependence on the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, (9) in dependence on this world, (10) in dependence on the other world, (11) in dependence on what is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, and examined by the mind. Such is the meditation of a person who is like a wild colt.

"And how, Sandha, does a thoroughbred meditate? When an excellent thoroughbred horse is tied up near the feeding trough he does not meditate: 'Fodder, fodder!' For what reason? Because when an excellent thoroughbred horse is tied up by the feeding trough, he asks himself: 'Now what task will my trainer set for me today? What can I do to satisfy him?' Tied up by the feeding trough, he does not meditate: 'Fodder, fodder!' For that excellent thoroughbred horse regards the application of the goad as a debt, a bond, a loss, and failure. So too, an excellent thoroughbred person, when gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, does not dwell with a mind obsessed and oppressed by sensual lust, and he understands as it really is the escape from arisen sensual lust. He does not dwell with a mind obsessed and oppressed by ill will ... by dullness and drowsiness ... by restlessness and remorse ... by doubt, and he understands as it really is the escape from arisen doubt.

"He does not meditate (1) in dependence on earth, (2) in dependence on water, (3) in dependence on fire, (4) in dependence on air, (5) in dependence on the base of the infinity of space, (6) in dependence on the base of the infinity of consciousness, (7) in dependence on the base of nothingness, (8) in dependence on the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, [325] (9) in dependence on this world, (10) in dependence on the other world, (11) in dependence on what is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, or examined by the mind, and yet he meditates.

"When he meditates in such a way, the devas along with Indra, Brahmā, and Pajāpati worship the excellent thoroughbred person from afar, saying:
"Homage to you, O thoroughbred person!

Homage to you, O supreme person!

We ourselves do not understand

What you meditate in dependence on." ${ }^{\prime 2210}$

When this was said, the Venerable Sandha said to the Blessed One: "But how, Bhante, does an excellent thoroughbred person meditate? If he does not meditate in. dependence on earth ...in dependence on what is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, and examined by the mind, and yet he meditates, just how does he meditate so that the devas . . . worship the excellent thoroughbred person from afar, saying:

"Homage to you, O thoroughbred person!..

What you meditate in dependence on'?"

"Here, Sandha, for an excellent thoroughbred person, the perception of earth has disappeared in relation to earth, ${ }^{2211}$ the perception of water has disappeared in relation to water, the perception of fire has disappeared in relation to fire, the perception of air has disappeared in relation to air, the perception of the base of the infinity of space has disappeared in relation to the base of the infinity of space, the perception of the base of the infinity of consciousness has disappeared in relation to the base of the infinity of consciousness, [326] the perception of the base of nothingness has disappeared in relation to the base of nothingness, the perception of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception has disappeared in relation to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, the perception of this world has disappeared in relation to this world, the perception of the other world has disappeared in relation to the other world; perception has disappeared in relation to whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, and examined by the mind.

"Meditating in.such a way, Sandha, an excellent thoroughbred person does not meditate in dependence on earth, in dependence on water, in dependence on fire, in dependence on air; in dependence on the base of the infinity of space, in dependence on the base of the infinity of consciousness, in dependence on the base of nothingness, in dependence on the
base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, in dependence on this world, in dependence on the other world; in dependence on what is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, or examined by the mind and yet he meditates. ${ }^{2212}$ And as he meditates in such a way, the devas along with Indra, Brahmā, and Pajāpati worship the excellent thoroughbred person from afar, saying:

"Homage to you, O thoroughbred person!

Homage to you, O supreme person!

We ourselves do not understand

What you meditate in dependence on."

10 (10) The Peacock Sanctuary ${ }^{2213}$

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha at the wanderers' park, the peacock sanctuary. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, possessing three qualities, a bhikkhu is best among devas and humans: one who has reached the ultimate conclusion, won ultimate security from bondage, lived the ultimate spiritual life, and gained the ultimate consummation. What three? (1) The aggregate of virtuous behavior of one beyond training, (2) the aggregate of concentration of one beyond training, and (3) the aggregate of wisdom of one beyond training. Possessing these three qualities, a bhikkhu [327] is best among devas and humans: one who has ... gained the ultimate consummation.

"Bhikkhus, possessing another three qualities, a bhikkhu is best among devas and humans: one who has ... gained the ultimate consummation. What three? (4) The wonder of psychic potency, (5) the wonder of mind-reading, and (6) the wonder of instruction. Possessing these three qualities, a bhikkhu is best among devas and humans: one who has ... gained the ultimate consummation.

"Bhikkhus, possessing another three qualities, a bhikkhu is best among devas and humans: one who has ... gained the ultimate consummation. What three? (7) Right view, (8) right knowledge, and (9) right liberation. Possessing these three
qualities, a bhikkhu is best among devas and humans: one who has . . . gained the ultimate consummation.

"Bhikkhus, possessing two qualities, a bhikkhu is best among devas and humans: one who has . . . gained the ultimate consummation. What two? (10) True knowledge and (11) conduct. Possessing these two qualities, a bhikkhu is best among devas and humans: one who has reached the ultimate conclusion, won ultimate security from bondage, lived the ultimate spiritual life, and gained the ultimate consummation.

"Brahmā Sanamkumāra, too, spoke this verse:

"The khattiya is the best among people for those whose standard is the clan, but one accomplished in true knowledge and conduct is best among devas and humans.'

"This verse, bhikkhus, was well recited by Brahmā Sanamkumāra, not badly recited; it was well spoken, not badly spoken; [328] it is beneficial, not harmful, and I approved of it. I too say thus:

"The khattiya is the best among people for those whose standard is the clan, but one accomplished in true knowledge and conduct is best among devas and humans."

# II. RECOLLECTION

11 (1) Mahānāma (1) ${ }^{2214}$

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Park. Now on that occasion a number of bhikkhus were making a robe for the Blessed One, thinking that with his robe completed, at the end of the three months [of the rains residence], the Blessed One would set out wandering. Mahānāma the Sakyan heard about this, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, I have heard: 'A number of bhikkhus are making a robe for the Blessed One, thinking that with his robe completed, at the end of the three months [of the rains residence],
the Blessed One will set out wandering.' Bhante, with all our various engagements, how should we dwell?"2215 [329]

"Good, good, Mahānāma! It is fitting for you clansmen to approach the Tathāgata and ask: 'Bhante, with all our various engagements, how should we dwell?'

(1) "Mahānāma, a person with faith succeeds, not one without faith. (2) An energetic person succeeds, not one who is lazy. (3) One with mindfulness established succeeds, not one who is muddle-minded. (4) One who is concentrated succeeds, not one who is unconcentrated. (5) One who is wise succeeds, not one who is unwise. Having established yourself in these five qualities, you should further develop six things.

(6) "Here, Mahānāma, you should recollect the Tathāgata thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' When a noble disciple recollects the Tathāgata, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight, based on the Tathāgata. A noble disciple whose mind is straight gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is called a noble disciple who dwells in balance amid an unbalanced population, who dwells unafflicted amid an afflicted population. As one who has entered the stream of the Dhamma, he develops recollection of the Buddha.

(7) "Again, Mahānāma, you should recollect the Dhamma thus: 'The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.' When a noble disciple recollects the Dhamma, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, [330] hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight, based on the Dhamma. A noble disciple whose mind is straight gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. When he is joyful, rapture arises.

For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is called a noble disciple who dwells in balance amid an unbalanced population, who dwells unafflicted amid an afflicted population. As one who has entered the stream of the Dhamma, he develops recollection of the Dhamma.

(8) "Again, Mahānāma, you should recollect the Sangha thus: 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is practicing the good way, practicing the straight way, practicing the true way, practicing the proper way; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals-this Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.' When a noble disciple recollects the Sangha, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight, based on the Sangha. A noble disciple whose mind is straight gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is called a noble disciple who dwells in balance amid an unbalanced population, who dwells unafflicted amid an afflicted population. As one who has entered the stream of the Dhamma, he develops recollection of the Sangha.

(9) "Again, Mahānāma, you should recollect your own virtuous behavior as unbroken, flawless, unblemished, unblotched, freeing, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading to concentration. When a noble disciple recollects his virtuous behavior, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or [331] delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight, based on virtuous behavior. A noble disciple whose mind is straight gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is called a noble disciple who dwells in balance
amid an unbalanced population, who dwells unafflicted amid an afflicted population. As one who has entered the stream of the Dhamma, he develops recollection of virtuous behavior.

(10) "Again, Mahānāma, you should recollect your own generosity thus: 'It is truly my good fortune and gain that in a population obsessed by the stain of miserliness, I dwell at home with a mind devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in relinquishment, devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing.' When a noble disciple recollects his generosity, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight, based on generosity. A noble disciple whose mind is straight gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is called a noble disciple who dwells in balance amid an unbalanced population, who dwells unafflicted amid an afflicted population. As one who has entered the stream of the Dhamma, he develops recollection of generosity.

(11) "Again, Mahānāma, you should recollect the deities thus: 'There are devas [ruled by] the four great kings, Tāvatimsa devas, Yāma devas, Tusita devas, devas who delight in creation, devas who control what is created by others, devas of Brahmā's company, and devas still higher than these. There exists in me too such faith as those deities possessed because of which, when they passed away here, [332] they were reborn there; there exists in me too such virtuous behavior...such learning . . . such generosity . . . such wisdom as those deities possessed because of which, when they passed away here, they were reborn there.' When a noble disciple recollects the faith, virtuous behavior, learning, generosity, and wisdom in himself and in those deities, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight, based on the deities. A noble disciple whose mind is straight gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure.

For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is called a noble disciple who dwells in balance amid an unbalanced population, who dwells unafflicted amid an afflicted population. As one who has entered the stream of the Dhamma, he develops recollection of the deities."

[Opening as in 11:11, down to:] [333]

"Having established yourself in these five qualities, Mahānāma, you should further develop six things.

(6) "Here, Mahānāma, you should recollect the Tathāgata thus: 'The Blessed One is . . . the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.'

For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. Mahānāma, you should develop this recollection of the Buddha while walking, standing, sitting, and lying down. You should develop it while engaged in work and while living at home in a house full of children. [334]

(7) "Again, Mahānāma you should recollect the Dhamma... (8) ... the Sangha... (9) ... your own virtuous behavior ... (10) ... your own generosity ... (11) ... the deities thus....

# 13 (3) Nandiya

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Park. Now on that occasion the Blessed One wanted to enter upon the rains residence in Sāvatthī. Nandiya the Sakyan heard about this and it then [335] occurred to him: "I will also enter upon the rains residence in Sāvatthī. ${ }^{3216}$ There I will engage in business and from time to time get to see the Blessed One."

Then the Blessed One entered upon the rains residence in Sāvatthī. Nandiya the Sakyan also entered upon the rains residence in Sāvatthī, where he engaged in business and from time to time got to see the Blessed One. Now on that occasion a number of bhikkhus were making a robe for the Blessed One, thinking that with his robe completed, at the end of the three months [of the rains residence], the Blessed One would set out wandering. Nandiya the Sakyan heard about this, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, I have heard: 'A number of bhikkhus are making a robe for the Blessed One, thinking that with his robe completed, at the end of the three months [of the rains residence], the Blessed One will set out wandering.' Bhante, with all our various engagements, how should we dwell?"

"Good, good, Nandiya! It is fitting for you clansmen to approach the Tathāgata and ask: 'Bhante, with all our various engagements, how should we dwell?'

(1) "Nandiya, a person with faith succeeds, not one without faith. (2) A virtuous person succeeds, not an immoral one. (3) An energetic person succeeds, not one who is lazy. (4) One with mindfulness established succeeds, not one who is muddleminded. (5) One who is concentrated succeeds, not one who is unconcentrated. (6) One who is wise succeeds, not one who is unwise. Having established yourself in these six qualities, you should establish mindfulness internally concerning five things.

(7) "Here, Nandiya, you should recollect the Tathāgata thus: [336] 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One,
the Blessed One.' Thus you should establish mindfulness internally based on the Tathāgata:

(8) "Again, Nandiya, you should recollect the Dhamma thus: 'The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.' Thus you should establish mindfulness internally based on the Dhamma.

(9) "Again, Nandiya, you should recollect good friends thus: 'It is truly my good fortune and gain that I have good friends who take compassion on me, who desire my good, who exhort and instruct me.' Thus you should establish mindfulness internally based on good friends.

(10) "Again, Nandiya, you should recollect your own generosity thus: 'It is truly my good fortune and gain that in a population obsessed by the stain of miserliness, I dwell at home with a mind devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in relinquishment, devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing.' Thus you should establish mindfulness internally based on generosity.

(11) "Again, Nandiya, you should recollect the deities thus: 'Those deities that have been reborn in a mind-made body in companionship with the devas who transcend those subsisting on edible food do not see in themselves anything still to be done or [any need] to increase what has been done. Just as a permanently liberated bhikkhu does not see in himself anything still to be done or [any need] to increase what has been done, ${ }^{2217}$ so it is with those deities that have been reborn in a mind-made body in companionship with the devas who transcend those subsisting on edible food. ${ }^{\prime 2218}$ [337] Thus you should establish mindfulness internally based on the deities.

"Nandiya, a noble disciple who possesses these eleven qualities abandons bad unwholesome qualities and does not take them up. Just as a pot turned upside down does not receive back the water that has been poured out, and just as a fire that has gotten out of control ${ }^{2219}$ advances burning up a dry woodland and does not return to what it has burnt, so too, a noble disciple who possesses these eleven qualities abandons bad unwholesome qualities and does not take them up."

14 (4) Subhūti

Then the Venerable Subhūti together with the bhikkhu Saddha approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to the Venerable Subhūti:

"What is this bhikkhu's name, Subhūti?"

"His name is Saddha, Bhante. He is the son of a male lay follower endowed with faith, ${ }^{2220}$ and he has gone forth from the household life into homelessness out of faith."

"I hope that this son of a male lay follower endowed with faith, the bhikkhu Saddha, who has gone forth from the household life into homelessness out of faith, exhibits the manifestations of faith." ${ }^{2221}$

"This is the time for it, Blessed One! This is the time for it, Fortunate One! The Blessed One should explain the manifestations of faith. Now I will find out whether or not this bhikkhu exhibits the manifestations of faith."

"Then listen, Subhūti, and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," the Venerable Subhūti replied. The Blessed One said this: [338]

(1) "Here, Subhūti, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. This is a manifestation of faith in one endowed with faith.

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and accumulates what he has learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life-such teachings as these he has learned much of, retained in mind, recited verbally, mentally investigated, and penetrated well by view. This, too, is a manifestation of faith in one endowed with faith.

(3) "Again, a bhikkhu has good friends, good companions, good comrades. This, too, is a manifestation of faith in one endowed with faith.

(4) "Again, a bhikkhu is easy to correct and possesses qualities that make him easy to correct; he is patient and receives instruction respectfully. This, too, is a manifestation of faith in one endowed with faith.
(5) "Again, a bhikkhu is skillful and diligent in attending to the diverse chores that are to be done for his fellow monks; he possesses sound judgment about them in order to carry out and arrange them properly. This, too, is a manifestation of faith in one endowed with faith. [339]

(6) "Again, a bhikkhu loves the Dhamma and is pleasing in his assertions, filled with a lofty joy in regard to the Dhamma and discipline. This, too, is a manifestation of faith in one endowed with faith.

(7) "Again, a bhikkhu has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities. This, too, is a manifestation of faith in one endowed with faith.

(8) "Again, a bhikkhu gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life. This, too, is a manifestation of faith in one endowed with faith.

(9) "Again, a bhikkhu recollects his manifold past abodes... [as in 6:2 §4]...Thus he recollects his manifold past abodes with their aspects and details. [340] This, too, is a manifestation of faith in one endowed with faith.

(10) "Again, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, a bhikkhu sees beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate ... [as in 6:2 §5] . . and he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma. This, too, is a manifestation of faith in one endowed with faith.

(11) "Again, with the destruction of the taints, a bhikkhu has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. This, too, is a manifestation of faith in one endowed with faith."

When this was said, the Venerable Subhūti said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, these manifestations of faith in one endowed with faith that the Blessed One has spoken of are seen in this bhikkhu, and he does exhibit them.

(1) "This bhikkhu, Bhante, is virtuous ... [341] he trains in them.

(2) "He has learned much . . . and penetrated well by view.
(3) "He has good friends, good companions, good comrades.

(4) "He is easy to correct and possesses qualities that make him easy to correct; he is patient and receives instruction respectfully:

(5) "He is skillful and diligent . . . in order to carry out and arrange them properly.

(6) "He loves the Dhamma . . . in regard to the Dhamma and discipline.

(7) "He has aroused energy . . . not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities.

(8) "He gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas ... in this very life.

(9) "He recollects his manifold past abodes . . . with their aspects and details.

(10) "He sees beings passing away and being reborn... and he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma.

(11) "With the destruction of the taints, this bhikkhu has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.

"Bhante, these manifestations of faith in one endowed with faith that the Blessed One has spoken of are seen in this bhikkhu, and he does exhibit them."

"Good, good, Subhūti! In that case, Subhūti, you may dwell together with this bhikkhu Saddha, and when you want to see the Tathāgata, you may bring him along." [342]

# 15 (5) Loving-Kindness ${ }^{2222}$

"Bhikkhus, when the liberation of the mind by loving-kindness has been pursued, developed, and cultivated, made a vehicle and basis, carried out, consolidated, and properly undertaken, eleven benefits are to be expected. What eleven?

(1) "One sleeps well; (2) one awakens happily; (3) one does not have bad dreams; (4) one is pleasing to human beings; (5) one is pleasing to spirits; (6) deities protect one; (7) fire, poison, and weapons do not injure one; (8) one's mind quickly becomes concentrated; (9) one's facial complexion is serene; (10) one dies unconfused; and (11) if one does not penetrate further, one fares on to the brahmā world. ${ }^{2223}$
"When, bhikkhus, the liberation of the mind by lovingkindness has been repeatedly pursued, developed, and cultivated, made a vehicle and basis, carried out, consolidated, and properly undertaken, these eleven benefits are to be expected."

16 (6) Dasama ${ }^{2224}$

On one occasion the Venerable Ānanda was living at Beluvagāmaka near Vesālī. Now on that occasion the householder Dasama of Atṭhakanagara ${ }^{2225}$ had arrived at Pātaliputta on a business matter. Then he approached a certain bhikkhu in the Cock's Park and asked him: "Bhante, where is the Venerable Ānanda staying now? I want to see him."

"He is staying at Beluvagāmaka near Vesālī, householder."

When the householder Dasama had completed his business at Pātaliputta, he went to the Venerable Ānanda at Beluvagāmaka near Vesālī. He paid homage to the Venerable Ānanda, sat down to one side, [343] and said to him:

"Bhante Ānanda, is there any one thing properly expounded by the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One who knows and sees, such that if a bhikkhu dwells diligent, ardent, and resolute in it, his unliberated mind is liberated, his undestroyed taints are destroyed, and he attains the as-yetunattained unsurpassed security from bondage?"

"There is, householder."

"And what is it?"

(1) "Here, householder, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. He considers this and understands it thus: 'This first jhāna is constructed and produced by volition. But whatever is constructed and produced by volition is impermanent, subject to cessation.' If he is firm in this, he attains the destruction of the taints. But if he does not attain the destruction of the taints because of that lust for the Dhamma, because of that delight in the Dhamma, ${ }^{2226}$ then, with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, he becomes one of spontaneous birth, due to attain final nibbāna there without ever returning from that world.

"This is one thing properly expounded by the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One who knows and
sees, such that if a bhikkhu dwells in it diligent, ardent, and resolute, his unliberated mind is liberated, his undestroyed taints are destroyed, and he attains the as-yet-unattained unsurpassed security from bondage. [344]

(2) "Again, householder, with the subsiding of thought and examination a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna... (3) ... the third jhāna ... (4) ... the fourth jhāna. . . . He considers this and understands it thus: 'This fourth jhāna is constructed and produced by volition. But whatever is constructed and produced by volition is impermanent, subject to cessation.' If he is firm in this, he attains the destruction of the taints. But if he does not attain the destruction of the taints because of that lust for the Dhamma, because of that delight in the Dhamma, then, with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, he becomes one of spontaneous birth, due to attain final nibbāna there without ever returning from that world.

"This, too, is one thing properly expounded by the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One who knows and sees, such that if a bhikkhu dwells in it ... he attains the as-yet-unattained unsurpassed security from bondage.

(5) "Again, householder, a bhikkhu dwells pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, likewise the second quarter, the third quarter, and the fourth quarter. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will. He considers this and understands it thus: 'This liberation of the mind by loving-kindness is constructed and produced by volition. But whatever is constructed and produced by volition is impermanent, subject to cessation.' If he is firm in this, he attains the destruction of the taints. But if he does not attain the destruction of the taints because of that lust for the Dhamma, because of that delight in the Dhamma, then, with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, he becomes one of spontaneous birth, due to attain final nibbāna there without ever returning from that world.

"This, too, is one thing properly expounded by the Blessed One, [345] the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One who knows and sees, such that if a bhikkhu dwells in it ... he attains the as-yet-unattained unsurpassed security from bondage.

(6) "Again, householder, a bhikkhu dwells pervading one
quarter with a mind imbued with compassion ... (7) . . . with a mind imbued with altruistic joy ... (8) . . . with a mind imbued with equanimity, likewise the second quarter, the third quarter, and the fourth quarter. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with equanimity, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will. He considers this and understands it thus: 'This liberation of the mind by equanimity is constructed and produced by volition. But whatever is constructed and produced by volition is impermanent, subject to cessation.' If he is firm in this, he attains the destruction of the taints. But if he does not attain the destruction of the taints because of that lust for the Dhamma, because of that delight in the Dhamma, then, with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, he becomes one of spontaneous birth, due to attain final nibbāna there without ever returning from that world.

"This, too, is one thing properly expounded by the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One who knows and sees, such that if a bhikkhu dwells in it . . . he attains the as-yet-unattained unsurpassed security from bondage.

(9) "Again, householder, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, [perceiving] 'space is infinite,' a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of space. He considers this and understands it thus: 'This attainment of the base of the infinity of space is constructed and produced by volition. But whatever is constructed and produced by volition is impermanent, subject to cessation.' If he is firm in this, he attains the destruction of the taints. But if he does not [346] attain the destruction of the taints because of that lust for the Dhamma, because of that delight in the Dhamma, then, with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, he becomes one of spontaneous birth, due to attain final nibbāna there without ever returning from that world.

"This, too, is one thing properly expounded by the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One who knows and sees, such that if a bhikkhu dwells in it . . . he attains the as-yet-unattained unsurpassed security from bondage.

(10) "Again, householder, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of space, [perceiving] 'consciousness is infi-
nite,' he enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of consciousness... (11) ... by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of consciousness, [perceiving] 'there is nothing,' he enters and dwells in the base of nothingness. He considers this and understands it thus: 'This attainment of the base of nothingness is constructed and produced by volition. But whatever is constructed and produced by volition is impermanent, subject to cessation.' If he is firm in this, he attains the destruction of the taints. But if he does not attain the destruction of the taints because of that lust for the Dhamma, because of that delight in the Dhamma, then, with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, he becomes one of spontaneous birth, due to attain final nibbāna there without ever returning from that world.

"This, too, is one thing properly expounded by the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One who knows and sees, such that if a bhikkhu dwells in it diligent, ardent, and resolute, his unliberated mind is liberated, his undestroyed taints are destroyed, and he attains the as-yet-unattained unsurpassed security from bondage. ${ }^{\prime 2227}$

When this was said, the householder Dasama of Aṭthakanagara said to the Venerable Ānanda: "Bhante Ānanda, just as if a man seeking one entrance to a hidden treasure all at once found eleven entrances to that treasure, so too, while I was seeking one door to the deathless, I have all at once gotten to hear eleven doors to the deathless. ${ }^{2228}$ Just as if a man had a house with eleven doors [347] and when that house caught on fire, he could flee to safety through any of these eleven doors, so I can flee to safety through any of these eleven doors to the deathless. Bhante, these members of other sects seek a fee for their teachers, so why shouldn't I make an offering to the Venerable Ānanda?"

Then the householder Dasama of Aṭthakanagara assembled the Sangha of bhikkhus from Pātaliputta and Vesālī, and with his own hands he served and satisfied them with various kinds of good food. He presented a pair of cloths to each bhikkhu and a set of three robes to the Venerable Ānanda. And he had a dwelling worth five hundred ${ }^{2229}$ built for the Venerable Ānanda.

# 17 (7) The Cowherd ${ }^{2230}$

"Bhikkhus, possessing eleven factors, a cowherd is incapable of keeping and rearing a herd of cattle. What eleven? Here, (1) a cowherd has no knowledge of form; (2) he is unskilled in
characteristics; (3) he fails to pick out flies' eggs; (4) he fails to dress wounds; (5) he fails to smoke out the sheds; (6) he does not know the watering place; (7) he does not know what it is to have drunk; (8) he does not know the road; (9) he is unskilled in pastures; (10) he milks dry; and (11) he shows no extra veneration to those bulls who are fathers and leaders of the herd. Possessing these eleven factors, a cowherd is incapable of keeping and rearing a herd of cattle.

"So too, bhikkhus, possessing eleven qualities, a bhikkhu is incapable of growth, progress, and fulfillment in this Dhamma and discipline. What eleven? [348] Here, (1) a bhikkhu has no knowledge of form; (2) he is unskilled in characteristics; (3) he fails to pick out flies' eggs; (4) he fails to dress wounds; (5) he fails to smoke out the sheds; (6) he does not know the watering place; (7) he does not know what it is to have drunk; (8) he does not know the road; (9) he is unskilled in pastures; (10) he milks dry; and (11) he shows no extra veneration to those elder bhikkhus of long-standing who have long gone forth, the fathers and leaders of the Sangha.

(1) "And how has a bhikkhu no knowledge of form? Here, a bhikkhu does not understand as it really is: 'All form of whatever kind is the four great elements and the form derived from the four great elements.' It is in this way that a bhikkhu has no knowledge of form.

(2) "And how is a bhikkhu unskilled in characteristics? Here, a bhikkhu does not understand as it really is thus: 'A fool is characterized by his actions; a wise person is characterized by his actions.' It is in this way that a bhikkhu is unskilled in characteristics.

(3) "And how does a bhikkhu fail to pick out flies' eggs? Here, a bhikkhu tolerates an arisen thought of sensual desire; he does not abandon it, dispel it, terminate it, and obliterate it. He tolerates an arisen thought of ill will . . . an arisen thought of harming . . . bad unwholesome states whenever they arise; he does not abandon them, dispel them, terminate them, and obliterate them. It is in this way that a bhikkhu fails to pick out flies' eggs.

(4) "And how does a bhikkhu fail to dress wounds? Here, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu grasps at its marks and features. Even though, when he leaves the eye faculty
unguarded, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him, he does not practice restraint over it; he does not guard the eye faculty; he does not undertake the restraint of the eye faculty. Having heard a sound with the ear ...[349]...Having smelled an odor with the nose ... Having tasted a taste with the tongue...Having felt a tactile object with the body...Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, he grasps at its marks and features. Even though, when he leaves the mind faculty unguarded, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him, he does not practice restraint over it; he does not guard the mind faculty; he does not undertake the restraint of the mind faculty. It is in this way that a bhikkhu fails to dress wounds.

(5) "And how does a bhikkhu fail to smoke out the sheds? Here, a bhikkhu does not teach the Dhamma to others in detail as he has heard it and learned it. It is in this way that a bhikkhu fails to smoke out the sheds.

(6) "And how does a bhikkhu not know the watering place? Here, a bhikkhu does not from time to time approach those bhikkhus who are learned, heirs to the heritage, experts on the Dhamma, experts on the discipline, experts on the outlines, and inquire of them: 'How is this, Bhante? What is the meaning of this?' Those venerable ones do not then disclose to him what has not been disclosed, clear up what is obscure, and dispel his perplexity about numerous perplexing points. It is in this way that a bhikkhu does not know the watering place.

(7) "And how does a bhikkhu not know what it is to have drunk? Here, when the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata is being taught, a bhikkhu does not gain inspiration in the meaning, does not gain inspiration in the Dhamma, does not gain joy connected with the Dhamma. It is in this way that a bhikkhu does not know what it is to have drunk.

(8) "And how does a bhikkhu not know the road? Here, a bhikkhu does not understand the noble eightfold path as it really is. It is in this way that a bhikkhu does not know the road.

(9) "And how is a bhikkhu unskilled in pastures? [350] Here, a bhikkhu does not understand the four establishments of mindfulness as they really are. It is in this way that a bhikkhu is unskilled in pastures. ${ }^{2331}$

(10) "And how does a bhikkhu milk dry? Here, when faithful
householders invite a bhikkhu to take robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick, a bhikkhu accepts without moderation. It is in this way that a bhikkhu milks dry.

(11) "And how does a bhikkhu show no extra veneration to those elder bhikkhus of long-standing who have long gone forth, the fathers and leaders of the Sangha? Here, a bhikkhu does not maintain bodily, verbal, and mental acts of lovingkindness both openly and privately toward those elder bhikkhus of long-standing who have long gone forth, the fathers and leaders of the Sangha. It is in this way that a bhikkhu shows no extra veneration to those elder bhikkhus of long-standing who have long gone forth, the fathers and leaders of the Sangha.

"Possessing these eleven qualities, a bhikkhu is incapable of growth, progress, and fulfillment in this Dhamma and discipline.

"Bhikkhus, possessing eleven factors, a cowherd is capable of keeping and rearing a herd of cattle. What eleven? Here, (1) a cowherd has knowledge of form; (2) he is skilled in characteristics; (3) he picks out flies' eggs; (4) he dresses wounds; (5) he smokes out the sheds; (6) he knows the watering place; (7) he knows what it is to have drunk; (8) he knows the road; (9) he is skilled in pastures; (10) he does not milk dry; and (11) he shows extra veneration to those bulls who are fathers and leaders of the herd. Possessing these eleven factors, a cowherd is capable of keeping and rearing a herd of cattle.

"So too, bhikkhus, possessing eleven qualities, a bhikkhu is capable of growth, progress, and fulfillment in this Dhamma and discipline. What eleven? [351] Here, (1) a bhikkhu has knowledge of form; (2) he is skilled in characteristics; (3) he picks out flies' eggs; (4) he dresses wounds; (5) he smokes out the sheds; (6) he knows the watering place; (7) he knows what it is to have drunk; (8) he knows the road; (9) he is skilled in pastures; (10) he does not milk dry; and (11) he shows extra veneration to those elder bhikkhus of long-standing who have long gone forth, the fathers and leaders of the Sangha.

(3) "And how does a bhikkhu pick out flies' eggs? Here, a bhikkhu does not tolerate an arisen thought of sensual desire; he abandons it, dispels it, terminates it, and obliterates it. He does not tolerate an arisen thought of ill will...an arisen thought of harming ...bad unwholesome states whenever they arise; he abandons them, dispels them, terminates them, and obliterates them. It is in this way that a bhikkhu picks out flies' eggs.

(4) "And how does a bhikkhu dress wounds? Here, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu does not grasp at its marks and features. Since, if he left the eye faculty unrestrained, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him, he practices restraint over it; he guards the eye faculty; he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. Having heard a sound with the ear...Having smelled an odor with the nose... Having tasted a taste with the tongue ... Having felt a tactile object with the body...Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, he does not grasp at its marks and features. Since, if he left the mind faculty unrestrained, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him, [352] he practices restraint over it; he guards the mind faculty; he undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty. It is in this way that a bhikkhu dresses wounds.

(5) "And how does a bhikkhu smoke out the sheds? Here, a bhikkhu teaches the Dhamma to others in detail as he has heard it and learned it. It is in this way that a bhikkhu smokes out the sheds.

(6) "And how does a bhikkhu know the watering place? Here, from time to time a bhikkhu approaches those bhikkhus who are learned, heirs to the heritage, experts on the Dhamma, experts on the discipline, experts on the outlines, and inquires of them: 'How is this, Bhante? What is the meaning of this?' Those venerable ones then disclose to him what has not been disclosed, clear up what is obscure, and dispel his perplexity about numerous perplexing points. It is in this way that a bhikkhu knows the watering place.

(7) "And how does a bhikkhu know what it is to have drunk? Here, when the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the

Tathāgata is being taught, a bhikkhu gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. It is in this way that a bhikkhu knows what it is to have drunk.

(8) "And how does a bhikkhu know the road? Here, a bhikkhu understands the noble eightfold path as it really is. It is in this way that a bhikkhu knows the road.

(9) "And how is a bhikkhu skilled in pastures? Here, a bhikkhu understands the four establishments of mindfulness as they really are. It is in this way that a bhikkhu is skilled in pastures.

(10) "And how does a bhikkhu not milk dry? Here, when faithful householders invite a bhikkhu to take robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick, a bhikkhu is moderate in accepting. [353] It is in this way that a bhikkhu does not milk dry.

"Possessing these eleven qualities, a bhikkhu is capable of growth, progress, and fulfillment in this Dhamma and discipline."

# 18 (8) Concentration (1)

Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: ${ }^{223}$

"Bhante, could a bhikkhu obtain such a state of concentration that (1) he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth; (2) of water in relation to water; (3) of fire in relation to fire; (4) of air in relation to air; (5) of the base of the infinity of space in relation to the base of the infinity of space; (6) of the base of the infinity of consciousness in relation to the base of the infinity of consciousness; (7) of the base of nothingness in relation to the base of nothingness; (8) of the base of neither-perception-nor-
non-perception in relation to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; (9) of this world in relation to this world; (10) of the other world in relation to the other world; (11) of anything seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, and examined by the mind, but he would still be percipient?"

"He could, bhikkhus." [354]

"But how, Bhante, could he obtain such a state of concentration?"

"Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is percipient thus: 'This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, the stilling of all activities, the relinquishing of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, nibbāna.' It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu could obtain such a state of concentration that he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth; of water in relation to water; of fire in relation to fire; of air in relation to air; of the base of the infinity of space in relation to the base of the infinity of space; of the base of the infinity of consciousness in relation to the base of the infinity of consciousness; of the base of nothingness in relation to the base of nothingness; of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in relation to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; of this world in relation to this world; of the other world in relation to the other world; of anything seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, and examined by the mind, but he would still be percipient."

# 19 (9) Concentration (2)

There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, could a bhikkhu obtain such a state of concentration that (1) he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth [355] . . (11) of anything seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, and examined by the mind, but he would still be percipient?"

"Bhante, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the Blessed One, take recourse in the Blessed One. It would be good if the Blessed One would clear up the meaning of this statement. Having heard it from him, the bhikkhus will retain it in mind."
"Then listen, bhikkhus, and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu could obtain such a state of concentration that he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth ... he would not be percipient of anything seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, and examined by the mind, but he would still be percipient."

"But how, Bhante, could he obtain such a state of concentration?"

"Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is percipient thus: 'This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, the stilling of all activities, the relinquishing of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, nibbāna.' It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhú could obtain such a state of concentration that he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth ... [356] ... he would not be percipient of anything seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, and examined by the mind, but he would still be percipient."

20 (10) Concentration (3)

Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, they sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Sāriputta:

"Friend Sāriputta, could a bhikkhu obtain such a state of concentration that (1) he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth ... (11) he would not be percipient of anything seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, and examined by the mind, but he would still be percipient?"

[What follows is identical to 11:18.] [357]

21 (11) Concentration (4)

There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus:

"Friends, could a bhikkhu obtain such a state of concentration that (1) he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth ...(11) he would not be percipient of anything seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, and examined by the mind, but he would still be percipient?"

"We would come from far away, friend, to learn the meaning of this statement from the Venerable Sāriputta. It would be
good if the Venerable Sāriputta would clear up the meaning of this statement. Having heard it from the Venerable Sāriputta, the bhikkhus will retain it in mind."

"Well then, friends, listen and attend closely. [358] I will speak."

"Yes, friend," those bhikkhus replied. The VenerableSāriputta said this:

[What follows is identical to 11:19.] [359]

## NOTES TO THE INTRODUCTION

1 Norman (2006a: 53) writes: "There is no agreement among scholars about the date when writing first came into use in India, but everyone, I think, agrees that during the early period of Buddhism, even if writing were available, all teaching was by oral methods, and the Buddhist scriptures were transmitted orally, as was also the case with the brahmanical texts."

2 For the Samyutta and Anguttara Nikāyas, Kelly uses the number of suttas that I had calculated in Connected Discourses of the Buddha and in the present work, respectively.

3 Kelly surveyed only the older stratum of works in the Khuddaka Nikāya: Khuddakapātha, Dhammapada, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Suttanipāta, Theragāthā, and Therīgāthā.

4 I can see no reason, apart from faulty transmission, for the recollection of generosity to be missing.

5 I have simplified the table to cover only the broad divisions.

6 In AN the threefold template occurs at 3:103-6. It also occurs in MN 13 in relation to sensual pleasures, bodily form, and feeling, and in SN in relation to the four physical elements, the five aggregates, and the six sense bases respectively at 14:31-33, 22:26-28, and $35: 13-18$.

7 In the Abhidhamma and later Pāli texts, views (diṭthi) were added to the asavas as well, thus increasing their number to four.

8 Several suttas subdivide the stream-enterer and the non-returner into subsidiary types, thereby increasing the number of noble ones. See 3:87 for the stream-enterer and 3:88, 7:16, and 7:55 for the non-returner.

9 Kelly (2011: 13) counts nineteen suttas in AN spoken to women. In contrast, according to his reckoning, the other four Nikāyas (including the older stratum of the Khuddaka Nikāya) have a total of only eight suttas spoken to women.

10 In Pāli editions it is customary to attach the word $\bar{a} d i$ to the first term of a series to indicate that the terms to follow conform to
the same pattern accorded the first term. It thus functions in the same way as "and so forth" does in English.

11 Sabbāgamasamvannanamanoratho pūrīto ca me yasmā/ Etāya manorathapūraṃ̄ ti nāmam tato assā.

12 The late Primoz Pecenko reports discovering a manuscript of the old $t \bar{t} k \bar{a}$ on the Anguttara Nikāya in Burma (2009: 23-27). He also says that several other manuscripts of this work are known to exist.

# NOTES TO THE ONES

17 Here and elsewhere I render the Pāli idiom cittam pariyādāya tittthati simply as "[it] obsesses the mind." Literally, it would be rendered "having overcome the mind, [it] remains [there]."

18 Mp: "The bodily odor of a woman is foul (duggandha), but what is intended here is the odor that comes from her body due to ointments, etc."

19 Mp: "The taste of a woman is the taste of her lips, saliva, etc., and the taste of the porridge and rice, etc., she gives to her husband. Many beings meet disaster after receiving sweets from a woman."

20 Mp: "Because of the different inclinations and underlying tendencies of beings, the Buddha mentions each of the [five sense objects] such as forms, saying: 'I do not see anything like this.' When a man esteems form, the form of a woman obsesses and impedes him-binds, captivates, deludes, and confuses him; but not so the other sense objects such as sounds. So too, sound but not form captivates one who esteems sound, etc. For some people, only one sense object obsesses the mind; for others, two objects-or three, four, or five objects-obsess them. Thus these five suttas are expounded because of the five kinds of esteem [for different sense objects]."

21 Mp: "It is not only men who esteem the five sense objects but women too: Therefore the next five suttas are formulated with women as the subject."

22 This series of suttas posits connections between the five hindrances and their principal conditions. In this respect, the suttas are similar to the sections of SN 46:2, V 64-65, and SN 46:51, V 102-3, on the nourishment of the five hindrances. For more on the five hindrances in AN, see 5:23, 5:51, 5:52, 5:193.

23 Subhanimitta. Mp: "The mark of the attractive is an object that is a basis for lust." Mp cites various uses of the word nimitta: as a condition (paccaya), a cause (kärana), concentration (samädhi), and insight (vipassana). Here it means "an agreeable object that is a basis for lust" (rāgatthāniyo itthärammanadhammo). Mp glosses ayoniso manasikaroto with anupayena manasikarontassa ("for one who attends unskillfully") and cites the definition of "careless attention" (ayoniso manasikära) at Vibh 373 (Be §936): "Careless attention is deviant attention, which takes the impermanent to be permanent, suffering to be happiness, what is non-self to be self, and the unattractive to be attractive. Or it is the mental turning, advertence, leaning, consideration, attention [to an object] in a way that runs contrary to the [four noble] truths." It seems to me doubtful that this explanation of ayoniso manasikära will hold for all applications of the term in the Nikāyas. Even in the following sutta, on the arising and increase of ill will, it is questionable that attending carelessly to "the mark of the repulsive" can be subsumed under any of the four distortions in the definition at Vibh 373.

24 Patighanimitta. Mp: "This denotes a disagreeable mark; it is a designation for aversion (repulsion) and for a repulsive object" (anittham nimittaṃ; patighassapi patighassärammanassapi etaṃ adhiwacanam). Interestingly, Mp continues with a citation from "the commentary": "For it is said in the commentary: 'The mark of the repulsive is aversion (repulsion) and a repulsive object'" (vuttampi c'etam atthakathāyam patighampi patighanimittam, patighärammanopi dhammo patighanimittan ti). Mp-t identifies "the commentary" as "the Great Commentary" (mahā atthakathā), one of the ancient Sinhala commentaries that Buddhaghosa used as the source for his own commentaries. These ancient commentaries are no longer extant, but this allusion makes it clear that Buddhaghosa worked with sources and did not write original compositions.

25 These terms are defined at Vibh 352 (Be $\S \S 856-860$ ).

26 Avūpasantacittassa. Mp: "A mind not settled by jhāna or insight."

27 Mp cites Dhs 205 (Be §1167) for a definition of the hindrance of doubt (vicikicchänivaraña) as doubt about the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha, and the training (see too 5:205).

28 This series, 1:16-20, corresponds to SN 46:51 §3, V 105-6, on the "denourishment" or removal of the five hindrances.

29 Mp uses the commentarial scheme of five kinds of abandoning to explain how sensual desire and the other hindrances are abandoned: (1) in a particular respect (tadañgappahāna), through
insight; (2) by suppression (vikkhambhanappahāna), through a meditative attainment; (3) by eradication (samucchedappahāna), through the world-transcending path; (4) by subsiding (pati-passaddhippahāna), through the fruition; and (5) by escape (nissaranappahāna), through nibbāna, "the release from all defilements." Mp says that all five apply here.

Mp identifies the "mark of the unattractive" (asubhanimitta) with the firstjhāna arisen on the basis of any of the ten unattractive objects (dasasu asubhesu uppannam sārammanam pathamajjhānam). This explanation relies on the Vism scheme, which takes the asubha objects to be corpses in stages of decomposition (see Vism 178-93, Ppn 6.1-80). While we do find meditation on decaying corpses in the Nikāyas (see below at 1:480-84), more typically the suttas explain the perception of the unattractive (asubhasañ $\bar{n} \bar{a}$ ) as meditation on the thirty-one components of the body (increased to thirty-two in later works by adding the brain). See, for example, 10:60 §3, on the perception of unattractiveness. This perception occurs among a group of five meditation subjects that culminate in the deathless (5:61), that lead to nibbāna (5:69) and to the destruction of the taints (5:70), and that bring liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom (5:71). At 7:49 §1, the perception of unattractiveness is recommended as the antidote to sexual desire, and at 9:1 $\S 6$ and 9:3 $\S 6$ it is prescribed for the abandoning of lust.

30 In line with the commentary to the Satipatṭhāna Sutta (at Sv III 778-82, Ps I 282-86), Mp enumerates six things that lead to the abandoning of each of the five hindrances. The six that lead to the abandoning of sensual desire are: learning an unattractive object, meditation on an unattractive object, guarding the doors of the sense faculties, moderation in eating, good friendship, and suitable conversation.

31 Mettācetovimutti: Mp: "Loving-kindness pervades all beings with [the wish for] their welfare. Since the mind associated with it is liberated from the opposed states such as the hindrances, it is called liberation of mind (cetovimutti). Specifically, this liberation of mind' is liberated from obsession by ill will. Here, what is intended by 'liberation of mind' is absorption (appana) by three or four jhānas [depending on whether the fourfold or fivefold scheme of jhānas is used]." Mp-t: "[This is said] because there is no thorough liberating [of the mind] by loving-kindness until one attains absorption." At 6:13 $\S 1$ loving-kindness is taught as the escape from ill will. At 9:1 $\S 7$ and 9:3 $\S 7$, it is recommended for abandoning ill will. 8:63 $\S 1$ teaches different approaches to developing the liberation of the mind by loving-kindness, and

8:1 and 11:15 explain, respectively, eight and eleven benefits of mastering the liberation of the mind by loving-kindness. The fourfold scheme of jhānas is typical of the Nikāyas; the fivefold scheme appears in the Abhidhamma by dividing the second jhāna into two: the second with examination but without thought, the third without thought and examination.

32. Mp mentions six things that lead to the abandoning of ill will: learning the meditation on loving-kindness, cultivating meditation on loving-kindness, reviewing ownership of kamma, abundant reflection, good friendship, and suitable conversation. On "reviewing ownership of kamma," Mp says that one should reflect thus: "If you get angry with another person, what can you do? Can you destroy his virtuous behavior, etc.? Didn't you come into this world on account of your own kamma and won't you depart through your own kamma? Getting angry with another person is like taking hold of a hot flameless coal or an iron stake smeared with excrement in order to strike someone. If he gets angry with you, what can he do? Can he destroy your virtuous behavior, etc.? Didn't he come into this world on account of his own kamma and won't he depart through his own kamma? Just like an offering of a cake that is refused, or like a fist full of dust thrown against the wind, his anger will remain with him." For more ways of overcoming anger, see Vism 298-306, Ppn 9:14-39.

33 Arambhadhātu, nikkamadhātu, parakkamadhātu. Mp explains these as three successively more powerful degrees of energy.

34 Mp mentions six other things that lead to the abandoning of dullness and drowsiness: moderation in food, change of posture, the perception of light, living out in the open, good friendship, and suitable conversation. For moderation in food, Mp (in line with other commentaries) suggests that when one still has room for four or five more mouthfuls, one should stop eating and drink water.

35 Vāpasantacittassa. Mp: "A mind pacified by jhāna or by insight."

36 Mp : "Six other things lead to the abandoning of restlessness and remorse: much learning, asking questions, being skilled in the Vinaya, approaching elder monks, good friendship, and suitable conversation."

37 This is an abridgment. SN 46:51 §3, V 106,9-15, says that the "denourishment" of doubt occurs "by giving careful attention to wholesome and unwholesome qualities, blamable and blameless qualities, inferior and superior qualities, dark and bright qualities with their counterparts."

38 Mp : "Six other things lead to the abandoning of doubt: much learning, asking questions, skill in the Vinaya, abundant resolve (that is, trust and faith in the Three Jewels), good friendship, and suitable conversation."

39 Apātubhütam. As I understand it, this statement is saying that the mind's potential has not yet become manifest, has not been tapped and applied.

40 Yathäbhatam nikkhitto. I translate this idiom on the basis of Mp's gloss: yatha äharitvä thapito.

41 Mp : "A mind corrupted by hate" (dosena padutthacittam). This sutta and the following might be seen as prose elaborations of Dhp 1 and 2. Though Dhp 1 and 2 use mano rather than citta, the adjectives are the same: paduttha and pasanna.

42 Mp: "[A mind] placid with faith and confidence" (saddhāpāsadena pasannami).

43 Mp: "Cloudy (āvilena): enveloped by the five hindrances." At 5:193 $\$ 5$ cloudy water is specifically identified with doubt and limpid water with freedom from doubt.

44 Uttarim manussadhammā alamariyañānadassanavisesam. I follow Mp, which treats uttarim manussadhammā as a complex ablative phrase relative to alamariyañānadassanavisesam. Mp says: "Superhuman: superior to the human virtue consisting in the ten courses of wholesome kamma. For this tenfold virtue is called 'human virtue' because it is undertaken by people on their own-even without anyone to encourage them-after they have been stirred at the end of 'the period of swords' (satthantarakappa; see DN III 73,4). The things superior to this are the jhānas, insight, the path, and the fruit. Distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones: the distinction [excellence] consisting in knowledge and vision that is fitting for the noble ones or able to produce the noble state. Knowledge itself is called 'knowledge' in that it knows, and it is called 'vision' in that it sees. This is a designation for the knowledge of the divine eye, insight knowledge, path knowledge, fruition knowledge, and reviewing knowledge."

45 Mp , using the Abhidhamma model of the mind, takes this to refer to the extreme speed with which the mind arises and vanishes. But at Vin I 150,7-14, in a passage on the conditions that entitle a bhikkhu to cut short his rains observance, it is said that if a woman is trying to seduce a bhikkhu at his rains residence, he is entitled to depart after reflecting: "The Blessed One said that the mind is quick to change, and here there is an obstacle to my living the celibate life." In this context, the obvious sense is not that the mind arises and ceases quickly but that one might
suddenly change one's mind, giving up the celibate life to submit to the charms of the woman.

46 Pabhassaram idam bhikkhave cittaṃ. The exact meaning of this statement has been a matter of contention that has spawned conflicting interpretations. Mp identifies the "luminous mind" with the bhavangacitta, an Abhidhamma concept denoting the type of mental event that occurs in the absence of active cognition. It corresponds, very roughly, to the subconscious or unconscious of modern psychology. The word bhavanga means "factor of existence," that is, the factor responsible for maintaining continuous personal identity throughout a given life and from one life to the next. However, the bhavanga is not a persistent state of consciousness, a permanent self. It is a series of momentary acts of mind that alternate with active cognitive processes (cittavithi), sequences of cognition when the mind consciously apprehends an object. Hence the texts sometimes use the expression bhavangasota, "stream of bhavanga," to highlight the fluid nature of this type of mental process. The occurrence of the bhavanga is most evident in deep, dreamless sleep, but it also occurs countless times in waking life between cognitive processes.

The most important events in the cognitive process are the javanacittas, ethically determinate occasions of consciousness that create kamma. The javanas may be either wholesome or unwholesome. It is in the javana phase that the defilements, dormant in the subconscious bhavanga, infiltrate mental activity and defile the mind. For a fuller discussion of the bhavanga, see CMA 122-29, where it is rendered "life-continuum." Harvey (1995: 166-79) has an interesting exploration of the relationship between the bhavanga and what he calls "the brightly shining mind."

Mp explains: "The bhavangacitta is called luminous, that is, pure (parisuddha), because it is without defilements (nirupakkilesatāya). It is defiled by adventitious defilements-by lust, etc.-which arise later [after the bhavanga] at the moment of javana. How? In the way that virtuous, well-behaved parents-or preceptor and teacher-get to be criticized and blamed on account of their undisciplined, badly behaved children or pupils, [as when people say]: 'They don't punish, train, exhort, or instruct their own children or pupils.' Well-behaved parents, or preceptor and teacher, are like the bhavangacitta, while the blame falling on the parents because of their children [or on the preceptor and teacher on account of their pupils] is like the naturally pure bhavangacitta being defiled at the javana moment by the adventitious defilements that arise
in states of mind associated with greed, etc., which cause lust, hatred, and delusion to infect it."

Though I quote Mp in full here, I find this explanation problematic on at least two grounds. The first is that the very concept of the bhavangacitta, and the corresponding notion of the cognitive process, are not found in the Nikayas but first emerge in a later period when the Abhidhamma was taking shape. Even the term bhavanga, though crucial to the Theravāda Abhidhamma system, occurs only in the last book of the Abhidhamma Pitaka, the Pattthāna. It is found much more often in the Abhidhamma commentaries.

The second reason I find Mp's explanation problematic is that the text flatly states "this mind is luminous," without qualification. This suggests that luminosity is intrinsic to the mind itself, and not to a particular type of mental event. Moreover, if the bhavanga is luminous, it should always remain so; it becomes incoherent to speak of it being defiled by the javanas. The simplest interpretation of this statement, so far as I can see, is that luminosity is an innate characteristic of mind, seen in its capacity to illuminate its objective field. This luminosity, though inherent, is functionally blocked because the mind is "defiled by adventitious defilements" (āgantukehi upakkilesehi upakkilittham). The defilements are called "adventitious" because, unlike the luminosity, they are not intrinsic to the mind itself. Of course, as 10:61 and 10:62 assert, there is no "first point" to ignorance and craving (and other defilements). But these defilements can be removed by mental training. With their removal, the mind's intrinsic luminosity emerges-or, more precisely, becomes manifest. The statement just below that the noble disciple understands the mind to be luminous implies that this insight into the intrinsic luminosity of the mind serves as the basis for further mental development, which liberates the mind from the defilements. With the complete removal of defilements, the mind's intrinsic luminosity shines forth unobstructed.

At 3:102, I 257,7 the word pabhassara is used to describe the mind (citta) that has attained concentration (samädhi). It thus seems that it is in deep samädhi that the intrinsic luminosity of the mind emerges, at least temporarily. 5:23, III 16,29-17,2 says explicitly that the mind freed from the five hindrances is luminous (pabhassara) and properly concentrated for the destruction of the taints. See too MN III 243,11-12, where it is equanimity (upekkhā), presumably of the fourth jhāna, that is described as luminous.

47 Cittabhavana natthi. Mp: "There is no stability of mind, no
comprehension of mind" (cittatthiti cittapariggaho natthi). Mp-t: "The development of mind [called] 'stability of mind' (cittatthiti) is the practice through which one can accurately understand defilement of the mind and liberation from it. The development of insight (vipassanäbhāvanā), which occurs based on the stabilization [of the mind] by fully concentrating it on a single object, is what is known as comprehension of the mind (cittassa pariggaha); [this occurs] together with the associated [mental] factors based on that object. It is through this that one can accurately understand the meaning stated."

The Nikāyas often set up a contrast between the "uninstructed worldling" (assutavā puthujjana), the common person of the world who lacks training in the Buddha's teaching, and the instructed noble disciple (sutava ariya sāvaka), who has learned the teaching and undertaken the training. More broadly, a puthujjana is anyone who has not yet reached the path of stream-entry (sotāpatti). An ariyasāvaka is not necessarily a "noble one" in the technical sense, but any disciple, monastic or layperson, who has learned the teaching and earnestly takes up the practice.

48 Mp: "In this sutta powerful insight (balavavipassanā) is discussed; but some say tender insight (tarunavipassanā)." Here, "tender insight" refers to the early stage of knowledge of rise and fall, while "powerful insight" to the mature stage of knowledge of rise and fall and the higher insight knowledges.

49 Mp says that by "pursues a mind of loving-kindness" (mettācittam āsēvati), the text refers to the mere pervasion of all beings with a wish for their well-being. Thus it seems that here "not devoid of jhāna" (arittajjhāno) does not necessarily mean that the monk actually attains one of the four jhānas but that he earnestly engages in meditation. The phrase "does not eat the country's almsfood in vain" means that by practicing meditation, the monk is worthy to receive almsfood from laypeople. He enables the donors to acquire merit and uses the almsfood properly to support the spiritual life.

50 Sabb'ete manopubbangama. Mp interprets this in line with the Abhidhamma doctrine that mind (citta) and its concomitants (cetasikas) occur simultaneously: "These [factors] arise together with mind (mano); they have a single arising, basis, cessation, and object. But because mind is what arouses, produces, generates, and originates them, they are said to have mind as their forerunner." Again, Mp reads this statement through the lens of the Abhidhamma analysis of mind. Understood in line with Dhp 1 and 2, the text probably means simply that before one commits any unwholesome bodily or verbal deed, one first decides to act
in such a way. This gives the statement an ethical rather than a psychological meaning. This interpretation is supported by the next sentence about the mind arising first, followed by the others. The same applies to the wholesome mind and its qualities in the next sutta.

51 Mp cites Vibh 350 (Be §846) for a definition of heedlessness (pamada): "What is heedlessness? Laxity of mind, looseness of mind, in regard to bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, mental misconduct, and the five kinds of sensual pleasures; and disrespect for the cultivation of wholesome qualities without persevering and persisting in this. [It is] looseness of procedure, lack of desire, non-commitment, non-determination, non-devotion, non-pursuit, non-development, and non-cultivation [of wholesome qualities]."

52 Mahicchatā. Mp explains this as "strong greed" (mahālobho) and, for a formal definition, it quotes Vibh 351 (Be $\S 850$ ): "What is strong desire? Lack of contentment, excessive desire with regard to robes, almsfood, dwelling places, medicines, and the five objects of sensual pleasure. Such desire, desirousness, strong desire, lust, passion, mental passion, is called strong desire."

53 Appicchatā. Mp: "Whereas the expression ['fewness of desires'] might be taken to mean that there could be a residue [of desire], the meaning is that there is no residue. For one is not called 'of few desires' if one still has slight desire; it is through the absence of desire, through persistent greedlessness, that one is said to be of few desires."

54 Asantutthitā. Mp: "This is the greed that arises from associating with, resorting to, and attending on discontented persons."

55 Santutthitā. Mp distinguishes three types of contentment: (I) contentment that accords with what one obtains (yathālābhasantosa), being content with any kind of robe (or other requisite) whether of fine or poor quality; (2) contentment that accords with one's ability (yathäbalasantosa), being content with what one obtains but selecting for use those things most congenial to one's health; and (3) contentment with what is appropriate (yathāsāruppasantosa), keeping the most basic gains for oneself and giving away the rest. For a translation of the full passage, see Bodhi 1989: 130-34.

56 Sampajañ̃ami. Here, Mp says only that this is a term for wisdom (pañña). For a fuller treatment of sampajañña according to the commentarial method, see Bodhi 1989: 94-130.

57 On the importance of good friendship (kalyānamittatā) in the spiritual life, see 9:3. See too SN 45:2-3, V 2-4.

58 I follow Ce, which treats this sutta as the eleventh in vagga VIII. Be and Ee both end this vagga with 1:80 and begin the next with

1:81. The Ce arrangement has the advantage of keeping thematically paired suttas together.

59 Ee titles the first part of this vagga, constituted by the first thirtytwo suttas, Catukotika, "Four-Pointed," and the second part, consisting of the last ten suttas, Adhammädi, "Non-Dhamma, Etc."

60 Here, and in all the couplets through 1:113, I read with Ce and Be ekañgampi over Ee ekadhammam pi.

61 Mp : "The ten courses of wholesome kamma are Dhamma; the ten courses of unwholesome kamma are non-Dhamma. So too, the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment-namely, the four establishments of mindfulness, the four right strivings, the four bases of spiritual power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven factors of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold pathare Dhamma; three establishments of mindfulness, three right strivings, three bases of spiritual power, six faculties, six powers, eight factors of enlightenment, and a ninefold path [are nonDhamma.] The four types of clinging; the five hindrances, the seven underlying tendencies, and the eight kinds of wrongness [the opposites of the noble path factors] are non-Dhamma. They teach non-Dhamma as Dhamma when they select one type of non-Dhamma and think, 'We will teach this as Dhamma. In that way our teacher's group will be emancipating, and we will become famous in the world.' By the.Vinaya method, Dhamma is a disciplinary action that should be done according to the claim, after having reprimanded, after having reminded, according to a true base: Non-Dhamma is a disciplinary action done without a claim, without having reprimanded, without having reminded, according to a false base."

62 Mp : "By the sutta method, discipline (vinaya) means restraint, abandoning, reflection, and the removal of lust, hatred, and delusion. Non-discipline (avinaya) means non-restraint, nonabandoning, non-reflection, and the non-removal of lust, hatred, and delusion. By the Vinaya method, discipline is a proper base, motion, announcement, bounded area, and assembly. Nondiscipline is a defective base, motion, announcement, bounded area, and assembly."

63 Mp , in line with other commentaries, explains five kinds of disappearance of the good Dhamma. I summarize: (1) Disappearance of attainment (adhigama-antaradhāna): the gradual disappearance of attainment of the paths, fruits, and auxiliary attainments such as the analytical knowledges (patisambhidā) and direct knowledges (abhiñña). (2) Disappearance of practice (patipatti-antaradhana): the gradual disappearance of the jhānas, insight, paths, and fruits, and even the eventual disappearance of virtuous behavior. (3)

Disappearance of learning (pariyatti-antaradhāna): the gradual disappearance of the Tipitaka, the Buddhist canon. (4) Disappearance of the emblem (linga-antaradhāna): the gradual discarding of the renunciant robes until monastics wear merely a strip of ochre cloth around their necks. (5) Disappearance of the relics (dhātuantaradhāna): at the end of the Buddha Gotama's teaching, his relics all gather at the Bodhi tree at Bodhgaya, replicate the Buddha's bodily form, and vanish in a blaze of glory.

64 Ee titles this vagga. "The Eleventh."

65 Ee titles this vagga "Not an Offense, Etc." By offense (āpatti) is meant a transgression of monastic discipline.

66 Mp : "Five classes of offenses are called light (lahuka) and two are called grave (gāruka, lit. "heavy"). Two are coarse and five are not coarse. Six classes are remediable and one is irremediable. Offenses with redress are the same as those that are remediable; the offenses without redress are the same as those that are irremediable." The two grave classes of offenses are (1) the pārā̄ikas, which entail permanent expulsion from the Sangha, and (2) the sanghādisesas, which require formal meetings of the Sangha and a complex process of rehabilitation. The five light classes are thullaccaya (gross transgression), pācittiya (expiation), pātidesanīya (to be acknowledged), dukkata (misdeed), and dubbhāsita (bad speech). These can be exonerated by confession to another monk. The grave offenses are also called "coarse" (dutthulla); the light ones, not coarse (adutthulla). The pārā̄ikas are "irremediable" (anavasesa) and "without redress" (appatikamma), because they do not allow for expiation; the other six classes are "remediable" (sā̃asesa) and "with redress" (sappatikamma) because they can be cleared by expiation.

67 This sutta, unlike those of the preceding vagga, does not include bahuno janassa. All three editions exclude it, though it is hard to see any reason apart from an old recitation or editorial error.

68 Ce counts here nine separate suttas, one for each epithet. I follow Be and Ee, which group them together as one sutta.

69 Asamasamo. Mp explains this to mean "equal to those without equal," that is, equal to the unequaled Buddhas of the past and the future. But elsewhere samasama means "exactly equal," and thus asamasama should probably be understood to mean simply "without equal." See DN I 123,12, MN I 329,7, MN I 515,24, MN I 516,11 , etc.

70 Dvipadānam aggo. Mp: "The best among human beings and devas."

71 I follow Ce and Be, which take each utterance to be a separate suttaland thus count twelve suttas here. Ee combines them into
one. Since the last sentence recapitulates all the items from "the manifestation of great vision" to "the realization of the fruit of arahantship," it seems this was originally a single sutta. However, to keep my numbering in alignment with Ce and Be , I count each separately.

72 On the "six things unsurpassed" (cha anuttariyäni), see 6:30. On the four analytical knowledges (catasso patisambhidayo), see 4:172. These are discussed in detail at Vibh 293-305 (Be 88718-50) and Vism 440-42, Ppn 14.21-27. Mp explains the "penetration of numerous elements" (anekadhātupativedha) by way of the eighteen elements (six sense objects, six sense faculties, six types of consciousness), and the "penetration of the diversity of elements" (nänädhātupativedha) by way of their different specific natures (nänäsabhävato). In the expression "fruit of true knowledge and liberation" (vijjävimuttiphala), Mp identifies true knowledge (vijjä) with the knowledge of the fruit, and "liberation" (vimutti) with the other factors associated with the fruit. Presumably this means the fruit of arahantship.

73 From here on, Ce and Be designate these divisions simply as -pāli rather than -vagga, e.g., the title of this division is etadaggapāli. Each group of ten (or more) suttas in the division is designated a vagga, named in Ce simply vaggo pathamo, vaggo dutiyo (first chapter, second chapter), etc., and in Be pathamavaggo, dutiyavaggo, etc. However, the major headings (ending in -pāli) are numbered consecutively to the previous divisions called -vagga, which suggests that each can be considered a major vagga comprising several minor vaggas. Thus the present division is numbered XIV (or 14), following the ekapuggalavagga ("One Person Chapter"), which was XIII (or 13). I follow Be and Ce in counting as a separate vagga or subchapter each group of ten (or more) suttas, each sutta being determined by the announcement of a particular disciple as foremost. Ee, in contrast, takes each grouping (subchapter) as one large sutta. Many of the facts and references in my notes to these chapters have been gleaned from DPPN.

74 He was the first to understand the four noble truths at the Buddha's first discourse, and the first to request admission to the Sangha. See SN 56:11, V 423,13-16 and Vin I 11,34-36, 12,15-26.

75 For more detailed biographical accounts of Sāriputta, Mahāmoggallāna, Mahākassapa, Anuruddha, and Mahākaccāna, see Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003, chaps. 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, respectively.

76 By psychic potency (iddhi) is meant the supernormal powers described in 3:60, I 170; 3:101, I 255, and elsewhere.

77 The ascetic practices (dhuta, dhutanga) are often observed by
monks for the sake of fewness of desires, being easy to support, and self-restraint. They include living in the forest, at the foot of a tree, in the open air, or in a charnel ground; using only three robes; wearing "rag-robes" made from pieces of discarded cloth; eating only food obtained on alms round; and sleeping in the sitting posture. See 1:378-81, 5:181-90. The standard thirteen ascetic practices are discussed in Vism chap. 2.

78 The divine eye (dibbacakkhu) is the ability to see objects at remote distances, including distant world systems; to see other realms of existence; and to see beings dying and being reborn in accordance with their kamma.

79 He was the son of Kăligodhā, a senior Sakyan lady, and a close friend of Anuruddha, with whom he went forth. A story about him is in Ud 2:10, 18-20. His verses are at Th 842-65.

80 Born to a wealthy family of Sāvatthī, he was given the sobriquet lakuntaka (dwarf) due to his small stature. His attainment of arahantship is recounted in Ud 7:1, 74. He is praised in Ud 7:2, 74-75; Ud 7:5, 76; and SN 21:6, II 279. His verses are at Th $466-72$.

81 He was the son of the chaplain of King Udena of Kosambi. When he visited Rajagaha and saw the gains that accrued to the bhikkhus, he decided to become a monk. In his early days as a bhikkhu he was gluttonous, but the Buddha taught him to be moderate in eating. He soon attained arahantship with the six direct knowledges. He was rebuked by the Buddha for using his psychic powers to win a sandalwood bowl (Vin II 110-12). He converses with King Udena about sense restraint at SN 35:127, IV 110-13. He is praised in Ud 4:6, 42-43. His verses are at Th $123-24$.

82 A nephew of Aññākoṇdañña, he was from a brahmin family that lived near Kapilavatthu, the Buddha's native city. After he attained arahantship he went to see the Buddha in Sāvatthī. Säriputta met him and they had a discussion on the Dhamma, preserved in MN 24. He was praised by Ānanda for his skill as a teacher at SN 22:83, III 105-6.

83 His story is told at Vism 387-89, Ppn 12.60-66. Because he was born by a roadside (pantha), he was given the name Panthaka. He is praised in Ud 5:10, 61. His verses are at Th 557-66.

84 He was the elder brother of Cullapanthaka, also born by a roadside. Being elder, when his brother was born he was called Mahā (large, great) and his brother Culla (small). His verses are at Th 510-17. Mp says that Cullapanthaka was particularly skilled in concentration and was therefore the foremost in mental transformation (cetovivatta). Mahāpanthaka was particularly skilled in
insight and was therefore foremost in the transformation of perception (sañ̃̃avivațta). Mp-t explains the difference thus: "One skilled in mental transformation is an attainer of the form-sphere jhānas who, in regard to a single object, is able to transform the mind of concentration (samädhicittaṃ) from successively lower jhānas to successively higher ones. One skilled in transformation of perception is skilled in transforming the aforesaid jhānas under the heading of perception, passing beyond the perceptions of form and moving from [the perception] associated with the base of the infinity of space to that associated with the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. Similarly, he is able to transform the mind from the perception of women and men, etc., and from the perception of permanence, etc., toward mere form and formless phenomena and, especially, toward the unconditioned nibbāna. Such a one is accustomed to the contemplation of emptiness (sun̄ñatānupassanābahulo)."

85 He was Anāthapindika's younger brother, who went forth on the day the Jetavana monastery was dedicated to the Buddha. He attained arahantship by developing insight based on the meditation of loving-kindness. Before teaching the Dhamma and when receiving almsfood, he would first enter jhāna through lovingkindness and then emerge. The Buddha explains to him the manifestations of faith at 11:14. His skill in meditation is praised in Ud 6:7, 71. His verse is at Th 1. Subhūti figures prominently in the [Mahāyāna] Prajñāpāramitā sūtras as chief exponent of the perfection of wisdom.

86 He was Sāriputta's youngest brother. Compelled by his mother to marry when still young, he ran away and received ordination. His verses are at Th 646-58.

87 He was from a very wealthy family of Sāvatthī. His conception of the ideal bhikkhu is at MN 32.5, 1213,10-19. He is praised in Ud 5:7, 60. He has his own verse at Th 3.

88 The story of his awakening is at 6:55, told more elaborately at Vin I 179-85, where it leads to the Buddha's granting permission to the bhikkhus to wear sandals. His verses are at Th 632-44.

89 He was from Avantī, the son of Kālī (see 1:267 below) and a pupil of Mahākaccāna. His story is told in Ud 5:6, 57-59. He traveled to Sāvatthī to see the Buddha. The Buddha invited him to spend the night in his cottage and praised him for his recitation of the Atṭhakavagga. His verses are at Th 365-69.

90 He was the son of Suppavāsā, in whose womb he remained for seven years and seven days. He emerged only after his mother made an offering to the Buddha (see Ud 2:8, 15-18, though the infant is identified by name only in the commentary). He went
forth on the day of his birth and became a once-returner just as his hair was being cut. Thereafter he attained arahantship. His verse is at Th 60.

91 The story of his love for the Buddha and his death by suicide is told at SN 22:87, III 119-24.

92 The Buddha's son. His first encounter with his father, when he was seven, is related at Vin I 82,8-31. The Buddha addresses the following discourses to him: MN 61, MN 62, MN 147; SN 18:1-22; SN 22:91-92; SN 35:121 (= MN 147); and Sn 2:11.

93 His story and his discourse on the Dhamma are at MN 82. His verses are at Th $350-54$.

94 Pathaman salakam ganhantanan. This refers to a method of assigning meals by choosing lots. He seldom appears in the Nikāyas but has a verse at Th 15 (=SN 1:5, I 3, ascribed to the Buddha).

95 A whole chapter about him, including his verses, is SN chap. 8. See too Sn 2:12. His verses, Th 1218-88, make up the largest section in the Theragāthā.

96 A younger brother of Sāriputta, he rejoices in his achievements in Ud 4:9, 45-46. An account of his death by snakebite is in SN 35:69, IV 40-41. His verses are at Th 577-86.

97 He is said to have attained arahantship at the age of seven. He was selected by the Sangha to be the appointer of lodgings and assigner of meals but was subsequently calumnied by a group of evil-minded bhikkhus (at Vin III 158-63 and again at Vin III 166-67; see too Vin II 74-80, 124-26). He is maligned by the same group at Vin IV 37-38. The story of his passing away is in Ud 8:9-10, 92-93. He has a single verse at Th 5.

98 He had been a brahmin in five hundred past lives and even after his ordination and attainment of arahantship, by force of habit he still referred to other bhikkhus by the derogatory term vasala. The Buddha exonerated him of wrongdoing (in Ud 3:6, 28-29). His supernormal powers are described at Vin I 206-9; III 67,9-17; III 248-51. He has a single verse at Th 9 (identical with Angulimäla's verse at Th 885).

99 His story is told in Ud 1:10, 6-9. Before he met the Buddha, he had lived as an ascetic, convinced he was an arahant until a benevolent deity disabused him of this notion. He hastened to visit the Buddha in Sāvatthī. Upon receiving the Buddha's teaching he immediately attained arahantship. He was killed by a cow shortly after his attainment. Though he did not receive formal ordination, he is still considered a bhikkhu.

100 He was the son of a woman who became a bhikkhunī while unknowingly pregnant with him. He went forth at the age of seven. He appears in DN 23 and MN 23. His verses are at Th 201-2. Mp says that he was designated foremost among those
of variegated speech (cittakathikannam aggo) because he adorned his Dhamma talks with many similes and reasons.

101 He appears in numerous suttas, usually questioning Sāriputta: MN 43;SN 12:67;SN 22:122;SN 22:127-35;SN 35:232; SN 44:3-6. At SN 35:162-63 he receives instructions directly from the Buddha. On the analytical knowledges (patisambhidā), see 4:172.

102 During the last twenty-five years of the Buddha's life he served as the Buddha's personal attendant. For a biographical account, see Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003, chap. 4. In Th 1027, he claims that he learned 84,000 teachings: 82,000 from the Buddha and 2,000 from the bhikkhus.

103 Mp : "Based on a single passage, grasping 60,000 passages according to the method explained by the Teacher, he knew all the passages. Therefore he was foremost among those with a quick grasp (gatimantänam aggo)."

104 Mp : "His energy in learning the Buddha's words, in recitation, in retention, and in attending upon the Teacher was unequaled by others. Therefore he was foremost among those who are resolute (dhitimantānam aggo)."

105 He was the head of a company of matted-hair fire ascetics whom the Buddha converted early in his ministry. His two younger brothers, Nadikassapa and Gayākassapa, who were also fire ascetics, followed him to discipleship under the Buddha. See Vin I 24-37. His verses are at Th $375-80$.

106 The son of one of Suddhodana's ministers, he had been a childhood playmate of the Buddha. He was sent by Suddhodana to invite the Buddha to return to Kapilavatthu. During this mission he inspired the Sakyans to have faith in the Buddha. His verses are at Th $527-36$.

107 He was swallowed by a fish as a child but miraculously survived. See Vism 379, Ppn 12.27. He became a monk at the age of eighty and attained arahantship in seven days. His conversation with a friend, Acelakassapa, is recorded as MN 124. His verses are at Th $225-27$.

108 He was a brahmin from Sāvatthī. His verses are at Th 165-66.

109 He had been the barber of the Sakyans in Kapilavatthu. He went forth along with Anuruddha and his cousins and became the foremost specialist in monastic discipline. He appears frequently in the Vinaya and in AN at 7:83, 10:31-38, 10:41-43, and 10:99. His verses are at Th $249-51$.

110 A former householder from Sāvatthī, he exhorts the bhikkhunīs at MN 146. In AN, see 3:66 and 9:4. His verses are at Th 279-82.

111 He was the Buddha's half-brother, son of Suddhodana and Mahāpajāpati Gotamī. The story of how he left his fiancée to become a bhikkhu is told in Ud 3:2, 21-24. He is instructed by
the Buddha at SN 21:8 and praised in AN at 8:9. His verses are at Th $157-58$.

112 He was the king of a frontier country who gave up his throne to follow the Buddha. His wife, Anojā, along with her attendants followed him and became a bhikkhuni. He is praised by the Buddha at SN 21:11 and SN 54:7. His verses are at Th 547-56.

113 He was one of the Buddha's attendants prior to Ānanda. He used his mastery over the fire element to subdue a ferocious fire dragon at Amba Ford, near Kosambi. On the instructions of the group of six troublesome bhikkhus, the householders of Kosambī prepared an intoxicating brew called kāpotikā for Sāgata. He drank it and fell down in a drunken stupor. In response, the Buddha laid down the rule against drinking intoxicants (Pācittiya 51); see Vin IV 108-10.

114 The word patibhāneyyaka apparently has a causative sense. Mp says "he was the foremost of the bhikkhus who cause eloquent discourses on the Dhamma to be spoken by the Buddha, those who are a condition for such discourses" (satthu dhammadesanāpatibhānassa paccayabhūtānam patibhānajanakānam bhikkhūnam...aggo). He receives discourses from the Buddha at SN 22:71, SN 23:1-46, and SN 35:76-78.

115 He was one of the sixteen brahmin students who questioned the Buddha in the Pārāyanavāgga. His exchange with the Buddha is at Sn 1116-19. He asks a question of the Buddha at SN 1:34, I 23, and has a verse at Th 207.

116 She was the Buddha's aunt and foster mother. In AN, see 8:51 (= Vin II 253-56) and 8:53 (= Vin II 258-59). Her verses are at Thi 157-62, and the story of her passing away at Ap II 529-43.

117 For a biographical sketch, see Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003: 263-97. She had been a consort of King Bimbisāra, proud of her beauty, but went forth after the Buddha dispelled her vanity. She gives a discourse at SN 44:1 and has verses at Thi 139-44. Along with Uppalavaṇ̣ā, she was one of the two chief bhikkhuni disciples who are held up as models for bhikkhunis in AN in 2:131 and 4:176 $\S 2$ and in SN 17:24.

118 She had been the daughter of a banker of Sāvatthi. Shortly after going forth, she attained arahantship together with the psychic powers. She was raped by a young man but the Buddha declared her faultless because she did not consent to the act. She exchanges words with Māra at SN 5:5, I 131-32. Her verses are at Thi $224-35$.

119 Her story is in Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003: 293-300. Her verses are at Thi $112-16$.

120 She teaches her former husband in MN 44 and has a verse at Thi.12.

121 Also known as Sundarīnandā because of her beauty, she was the Buddha's half-sister and the full sister of Nanda. Her story is in Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003: 282-85. She has verses at Thi $82-86$.

122 Her story is in Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003: 279-82. Her verses are at Thi $102-6$.

123 She was the daughter of a brahmin family of Sāvatthī. Her verses are at Thi $98-101$.

124 Her story is in Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003: 269-73. She had been a wandering ascetic and debater before she met the Buddha. Her verses are at Thi $107-11$.

125 In lay life she had been the wife of Mahākassapa, but by mutual consent their marriage was never consummated. Her verses are at Thi $63-66$.

126 Mp identifies her as Rāhulamātā, the mother of Rāhula; hence she was the Buddha's wife, better known in Buddhist tradition by the name Yasodharā.

127 She is the protagonist in the famous story of the mustard seed. Her biographical sketch is in Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003: 273-78. She has a dialogue with Māra at SN 5:3, I 129-30. Her verses are at Thi $213-23$.

128 She is said to have attained arahantship by giving prominence to the faculty of faith; hence her appointment as foremost of those resolved through faith.

129 Their encounter with the Buddha soon after his enlightenment is related at Vin I 4,1-27. They are said to have been from the Ukkala country. They provided the Buddha with his first meal after his enlightenment and went for refuge to the Buddha and the Dhamma (since the Sangha did not yet exist). Mp explains that the Buddha gave them some hairs from his head, which they brought to their native city and deposited in a cetiya (memorial shrine) that they built to accommodate them.

130 For a detailed account of his life and activities, see Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003, chap. 9.

131 He is the chief figure in SN chap. 41. For a biographical sketch, see Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003: 365-72.

132 Mp says that he was the son of the king of the state of $\bar{A} a v i$. On hearing the Buddha teach he became a non-returner. In AN he engages the Buddha in conversation at 3:35 and, with Citta, is held up as a model lay follower at 2:132 and 4:176 $\boldsymbol{\$} \mathbf{3}$ as well as at SN 17:23, II 235,20-25. He is praised by the Buddha at 8:23 and 8:24. After his rebirth as a deity, he comes to visit the Buddha
at 3:127. The four means of attracting and sustaining others (sangahavatthu) are at 4:32.

133 He was a Sakyan prince, the elder brother of Anuruddha and a cousin of the Buddha. He often engages in discussions with the Buddha and other bhikkhus. In AN he appears in 3:73, 3:126, 6:10, 8:25, 11:11, and 11:12.

134 He is praised by the Buddha in 8:21 and speaks about the agreeable things that he offers in 5:44.

135 From the account in Mp, he seems to be identical with Ugga of Hatthigama, praised by the Buddha in 8:22.

136 Mp relates a story of how Māra came to visit him in the guise of the Buddha to try to shake his confidence. Sūra, however, at once realized the deceit and exposed his visitor as Māra.

137. He was court physician to King Bimbisāra as well as to the Buddha and the Sangha. In AN he appears only in 8:26. The story of his early career and his service to the Buddha is told at Vin I 268-81. On the expression "foremost of those with confidence in persons" (puggalappasannänam aggo), Mp offers merely a word resolution. The intended sense, 1 assume, is that his confidence was based largely on personal confidence in the Buddha rather than on inquiry into the Dhamma.

138 According to Mp, he and his wife Nakulamātā had been the Buddha's parents in five hundred past lives and thus they still regarded him as their son. This, I believe, was what qualified them to be "foremost in trust" (vissāsakānam aggo). In AN they appear together in 4:55 and 6:16. A brief biographical sketch of the couple is given in Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003: 375-78.

139 She offered the bodhisatta his last meal before his enlightenment. Mp identifies her as the mother of Yasa (see Vin I 15-18), but this seems improbable. Sujātā was from Uruvelā, near presentday Bodhgayā, whereas Yasa is said to have been from distant Bārānasī.

140 She was the Buddha's chief female patron. A biographical sketch is in Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003: 247-55. The Buddha gives discourses to her in 3:70, 8:43, 8:47, and 8:49.

141 The servant of Sāmāvatī, she would go to hear the Buddha preach and repeat the discourses to the ladies of the court. The Itivuttaka is said to be the record of these teachings. In 2:133 and at 4:176 $\S 4$ she is held up, along with Velukaṇtakī Nandamātā, as the ideal model for a female lay follower. She is also praised in SN 17:24.

142 Orphaned as a girl, she became the wife of King Udena of Kosambi. Together with the women of the court, she died when her jealous co-wife, Māgandiyā, had the women's quarters set
on fire. The story is in Ud 7:10, 79. Her biographical sketch is in Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003: 285-93.

143 She is probably identical with Velukantakī Nandamātā, who, while held up elsewhere as an ideal laywoman, is not mentioned in this list. Velukanțakī Nandamātā is praised along with Khujjuttara in the suttas cited above in note 141. In 7:53 she speaks about her seven astounding qualities.

144 She was the mother of Sivalī. The story of her long pregnancy is in Ud 2:8, 15-18. The Buddha instructs her about the efficacy of giving food in 4:57.

145 She sliced flesh from her own thigh to feed a sick bhikkhu who needed meat. This caused the Buddha to prohibit the bhikkhus from consuming human flesh, even if willingly given. See Vin I 216-18.

146 Mp says that she was a close friend of Kālī of Kuraraghara. One day, while she was listening to a Dhamma discourse, thieves came to rob her house. She did not show any concern about the robbery but continued listening to the discourse. Her reaction caused the thieves to repent. With her help, they became monks and attained arahantship.

147 She was the wife of Nakulapita. She reveals her virtues in 6:16 and receives a personal discourse from the Buddha in 8:48.

148 A supporter of Mahākaccāna, she converses with him in 10:26. Mp says that she gained trust when she heard two yakkhas (spirits) speaking praise of the Three Jewels while traveling through the sky. She thereupon attained the fruit of stream-entry.

149 Be divides the twenty-eight suttas in this vagga into three subchapters of ten, nine, and nine suttas respectively. Ce, which I follow, treats them all as one vagga named Atṭhänapāli. Many of these utterances are also found in MN 115.12-19, III 64-67.

150 Mp : "One accomplished in view (dithhisampanna) is a noble disciple, a stream-enterer, possessing the view of the path (maggaditthiy $\bar{a}$ sampanna). The worldling, in contrast, can consider the conditioned phenomena of the three planes [the sensory plane, the form plane, and the formless plane] as permanent by way of the eternalist view (sassataditthi)."

151 Mp: "This is said with reference to the obsession with pleasure that occurs by way of the view of self (attaditthirasena), as in those who hold that the self is exclusively blissful and immortal, etc. But, with a mind dissociated from views (dithhivippayuttacittena), a noble disciple afflicted with fever might regard even feces as pleasurable, believing it can allay his fever."

152 Mp : "In the section on self, instead of speaking of a 'conditioned phenomenon' (sañkhāra), the expression 'anything' (kañci
dhanmani) is used; this is for the purpose of including conceptual entities such as the kasinas, etc. (see 1:455-64). Whatever the worldling grasps as permanent, pleasurable, and self, the noble disciple disentangles himself from its grip, considering it as impermanent, suffering, and non-self."

153 The first five are the heinous deeds that bring immediate result (anantariya kamma), necessarily producing rebirth in hell in the next existence. The five are mentioned collectively in 6:94. The six items together are referred to at Sn 233 as "the six things that cannot be done" (cha cābhiṭhānāni abhabbo kātuṃ) by the stream-enterer. Mp: "This here is the intention: 'The condition of a worldling is blameworthy insofar as a worldling can do these deeds that bring immediate results, such as matricide and so forth. But the noble disciple is powerful since he does not do such deeds." Regarding the shedding of a Tathāgata's blood, Mp says that the expression "with a mind of hatred" (padutthacitto) is used to highlight the motive. Devadatta, who wanted to kill the Buddha and take control of the Sangha, wounded the Buddha in a failed assassination attempt and thereby committed an anantariya kamma. But the physician Jivaka, wishing to restore the Buddha's health, cut his skin to extract bad blood; he thereby did a meritorious deed. On schism in the Sangha (sanghabheda), see 10:37, 10:39.

154 This is redundant, since sammā sambuddha means simply "a perfectly enlightened one," but I render the term thus to avoid misunderstanding. Though arahant disciples achieve sambodhi, full enlightenment, and are occasionally spoken of as sambuddha, "enlightened," the designation sammā sambuddha is reserved for the founder, who alone attains anuttara sammā sambodhi, "unsurpassed perfect enlightenment."

155 Mp explains the word "contemporaneously" (apubbam acarimam, lit., "not before, not after") to cover the period from the time a bodhisatta enters his mother's womb until the Buddha's relics disappear. There can be only one Buddha at a time because a Buddha is without a counterpart or peer (see 1:172, 1:174). Thus if two Buddhas were to arise simultaneously, this statement would be invalidated. The issue is also dealt with at Mil 236-39, cited by Mp. Mp says that because no suttas speak of the arising of Buddhas in other world systems, while there are suttas that say Buddhas do not arise elsewhere, it is only in this world system (imasmiṃyeva cakkavale) that they arise. Mp-t cites several suttas that it interprets as excluding the possibility of Buddhas arising elsewhere, but these texts do not seem to be as categorical as the author supposes. Perhaps this argument was intended to counter the idea being advanced in early Mahāyāna sūtras (or
even among other pre-Mahāyāna schools) that Buddhas arise in the world systems of the ten directions. For the early Buddhist view on world systems, see 3:81.

156 A "wheel-turning monarch" (rāja cakkavatī) is an ideal king who conquers the lands of the four directions by his righteousness. In AN he is mentioned in 3:14, 5:131-33, 7:62, and 7:66. For details, see MN 129.33-47, III 172-77.

157 It seems that in the old Nikāyas the idea of aspiring for future Buddhahood is not raised at all. Thus the claim being made here is not that a woman cannot become a perfectly enlightened Buddha in a future life but that a Buddha is always male. The assertion in this sutta need not be read as excluding the possibility that one who is presently a woman could become a Buddha, but this would have to take place in a future life, after she has undergone a change of gender. The statements are no doubt formulated in the context of the Indian culture of the period, which always assigned positions of authority to males. MA 181; a Chinese parallel of MN 115, does not include the section on the inabilities of women. Nevertheless, we do find the declaration that a woman cannot become a Buddha in another Chinese parallel of the sutta, at T XVII 713b20-22. It also occurs in a sūtra quoted in the Abhidharma Mahāvibhāṣā at T XXVI 502b16-18, and in the *Śāriputrābhidharma Śāstra at T XXVIII, 600b10-12. According to such later canonical texts as the Buddhavamasa, if a woman resolves to attain Buddhahood in the presence of a Buddha, her resolution does not succeed (i.e., she does not receive the prediction of future Buddhahood). For the resolution to succeed, the aspirant must be a male who has left the home life. See Bodhi 2007: 251-53. Sakka is the ruler of the devas in the Tāvatimsa heaven.

158 The words in brackets pertain respectively to the two suttas that are abridged in this triad. The same applies to the following two triads.

159 Ce and Be divide this chapter (called Ekadhammapāli) into separate subchapters (called vaggas), as shown, whereas Ee treats the subchapters of Ce and Be as independent vaggas.

160 Mp : "Disenchantment (nibbidā) is dissatisfaction with the round [of rebirths]; dispassion (virāga) is the fading away of the round, or the fading away of such defilements as lust (rāga); cessation (nirodha) is the ceasing of lust, etc., or the ceasing of the round; peace (upasama) is the stilling of defilements; direct knowledge (abhinin $\bar{a}$ ) is directly knowing the three characteristics; enlightenment (sambodha) is awakening to the four truths; and nibbāna is the realization of the non-conditioned nibbāna."

161 Recollection of the Buddha (buddhānussati) is the first of the six
recollections described more fully at 6:10 and elaborated at Vism 197-213, Ppn 7.1-67. Here is Mp (abridged): "Recollection of the Buddha serves two purposes: giving joy to the mind and promoting insight (cittasampahamsanatthañ c'eva vipassanatthañca). How? When a bhikkhu develops a meditation subject like unattractiveness [of the body], his mind may be disturbed, dissatisfied, and joyless. It does not remain on track but roams around like a wild bull. On that occasion, he should put aside his basic meditation subject and recollect the excellent qualities of the Tathāgata. As he recollects the Buddha, his mind becomes placid and free from hindrances. He can then return to his basic meditation object, develop insight, and reach the plane of the noble ones. Thus recollection of the Buddha gives joy to the mind. But one can also use this meditation subject directly for the purpose of developing insight. After recollecting the Buddha, one dissects the act of recollection into the five aggregates and defines them thus: 'These five aggregates are, in brief, the truth of suffering. The craving that produced them is the truth of the origin. The cessation of craving is the truth of cessation; and the practice that understands cessation is the truth of the path.' Thus one has defined the four truths in the preliminary portion [the stage of insight] and one step by step reaches the stage of the noble ones."

162 In Be these nine suttas are combined into one, numbered 297 in Be's cumulative numbering scheme. In Ce and Ee, they are numbered $2-10$ (since these editions number the first sutta in each vagga as " 1 " without cumulative numbering). I follow Be in using a cumulative numbering scheme, but I follow Ce and Ee in counting these suttas separately. Thus my numbering scheme from here on will exceed Be by eight, but without being matched by any corresponding scheme in Ce or Ee. In parentheses I give the sutta number internal to the subchapters, called vaggas, but simply enumerated without proper title.

163 The meditation subjects from recollection of the Dhamma through recollection of the devas are the other five recollections, also discussed in 6:10 882-6 and elaborated at Vism 213-26, Ppn 7.68-118. Mindfulness of breathing (ānāpānassati) is dealt with more fully at 10:60 §10, SN 54:10, V 322-25, and SN 54:13, V 328-33. For the commentarial treatment, see Vism 267-93, Ppn 8.145-244. Mindfulness of death (maranassati) is at 6:19, 6:20, 8:73, and 8:74, elaborated at Vism 229-39, Ppn 8.1-41. Mindfulness directed to the body (käyagatā sati), as the unattractive nature of the body, is at 10:60 83, and elaborated at Vism 239-66, Ppn 8.42-144. Recollection of peace (upasanānussati) occurs only here and is not separately explained but is treated at Vism 293-94,

Ppn 8.245-51; this treatment closely resembles the perception of dispassion and the perception of cessation at 10:60 $\S \S 6-7$.

164 In Ee called vagga XVII and named "Seed" (Bīja).

165 Mp: "This is a designation for the sixty-two wrong views"; see DN 1.1.29-3.31, I 12-39. It seems, though, that the term micchäditthi is used in the Nikāyas solely in relation to three views: moral nihilism, the doctrine of non-doing, and the doctrine of non-causality (natthikavāda, akiriyavāda, ahetukavāda).

166 Mp: "This is a designation for the five kinds of right view." Mp-t: "[The views of] ownership of kamma, jhāna, insight, the path, and the fruit. The knowledge included in the jhana consciousness is the right view of jhana, while insight knowledge is the right view of insight."

167 See 2:125, 10:93.

168 See 2:126, MN 43.13, I 294,1-4.

169 Ce considers this sutta and the next to contain seven suttas each: one each for bodily, verbal, and mental kamma, and for volition, yearning, aspiration, and volitional activities. Thus Ce counts twenty-two suttas for this section, as against ten in Be and Ee.

170 Nimbabtiam vā kosātakibījam vā tittakalābubtjam vā.

171 Asecanakatta. Lit., "not causing surfeit."

172 Ee counts this as vagga XVIII, named "Makkhali."

173 Mp: "Devadatta together with the six [non-Buddhist] teachers and others who are similar." For the views of the six teachers, see DN 2.16-33, I 52-59.

174 Mp: "When a Buddha has not arisen, this is a bodhisatta in the role of a wheel-turning monarch and others who are similar. When a Buddha has arisen, it is a Buddha and his disciples."

175 Makkhali Gosāla was one of the six teachers contemporary with the Buddha. He was the founder (or perhaps just an eminent teacher) of the Ājivakas (or Ājivikas). DN 2.20, I 53-54 ascribes to him the doctrine of non-causality (ahetukavada), according to which there is no cause for the defilement or purification of beings, who have no energy, self-control, or capacity for free choice.

176 Manussakhippam. Mp: "He has arisen in the world like a fish net for people, to prevent them from reaching the path leading to heaven and liberation."

177 Dāyakena mattā jānitabbā no patiggāhakena. Mp: "One should give within measure. One should not give fully, in excess. He [the Buddha] does not say 'one should not give,' but 'one should give a little, moderately.' Why? Because even if one gives fully, in excess, one does not achieve [as the fruit of one's gift] the state of a human being, or a heavenly rebirth, or the attainment
of nibbāna. There is no need for the recipient to be moderate in receiving. Why? Because he does not have to be moderate when things are being given to him fully; he does not practice fewness of wishes based on receiving in moderation."

178 Pațiggāhakena mattā jānitabbā. Mp: "The person receiving should set the limit. How? By taking into account the donor, the item to be given, and one's own capacity. For if the item to be given is plentiful, and the donor wishes to give a little, out of consideration for the donor one should accept a little. If there is only a little to be given, and the donor wishes to give a lot, out of consideration for the item to be given one should accept a little. If the item to be given is plentiful, and the donor wishes to give a lot, out of consideration for one's own capacity one should accept moderately. Having thus known moderation, the recipient fulfills the practice of fewness of wishes. [In this way] those who did not get a share get one, and the gains acquired remain stable. Those without confidence acquire confidence; those with confidence increase in confidence; one becomes an example for the multitude; and one helps the Teaching to continue for a long time."

179 Mp explains that after the Buddha had given a discourse on the rebirth of beings, saying that there are nine persons "freed from hell, the animal realm, and the sphere of afflicted spirits" (see 9:12), he considered: "If the bhikkhus, on hearing this discourse, think: 'We are freed from hell, etc.,' they may think there is no need to strive for the higher paths and fruits. Let me then stir up a sense of urgency in them." Mp glosses the words, "I do not praise even a trifling amount of existence," with: "I do not praise rebirth in any realm of existence even for a short time" (appamattakampi kālaṃ bhave patisandhim na vannayāmi).

180 Ce and Ee count these as four separate suttas, whereas Be combines them into one.

181 Ce gives this vagga the title Jambudīpapeyyālo, the "Jambudīpa Repetition Series." Ee counts this as vagga XIX and names it Appamattakam, "Few." Be simply calls it Catutthavaggo, "The Fourth (Sub-) Chapter."

182 Ce counts fifteen suttas in this first series; Be, by combining the second and third suttas, counts fourteen; Ee counts them all as one sutta.

183 Jambudīpa: the "Rose-Apple Continent," the southern continent in Buddhist geography. The other three continents are Aparagoyana to the west, Uttarakuru to the north, and Pubbavideha to the east. Mp says Jambudīpa is named after the "great rose-apple tree" in the Himalayas, which is a hundred yojanas wide, with branches fifty yojanas long and a trunk fifteen yojanas in diameter.

PED estimates a yojana to be seven miles; SED gives several alternatives but takes nine miles to be the most accurate.

184 The "middle provinçes" (majjhimā janapadā) correspond roughly to the northeastern and north-central states of present-day India. Mp cites Vin I 197,20-29, for an exact specification of its boundaries. It is said that Buddhas, pacekabuddhas, great disciples, etc., are born only here. Everything beyond these bounds is called the "outlying provinces" (paccantima janapadā). That the definitions are flexible is seen in Mp's statement that all of Jambudīpa can also be called the middle region and the other continents the outlying provinces. In Sri Lanka (in the time of the commentators), the Anuradhapura district was considered the middle region and the rest of the country the outlying provinces. On mleccha (the Skt equivalent of Pāli milakkha), SED offers: "a foreigner, barbarian, non-Āryan, man of an outcast race, any person who does not speak Sanskrit and does not conform to the usual Hindu institutions."

185 Mp: "The noble eye of wisdom (ariya paññācakkhu): the path together with insight."

186 Ce and Be ete va sattā bahutarā ye atthamaññāya dhammamaññāya dhammānudhammam na pațipajjanti; Ee ete va sattā bahutarā ye na attham aññāya na dhammaṃ aññāya dhammānudhammaṃ na pațipajjanti. I assume that in Ce and Be the negation na preceding the finite verb is intended to apply distributively to the preceding absolutives. The Ee reading is supported by an older Sri Lankan printed edition.

187 Samvejaniyesu ṭhānesu samvijjanti. Ona sense of urgency (samvega), see 3:128, 4:113. The commentaries enumerate "eight bases of the sense of urgency" (attha samvegavatthūni): birth, old age, illness, death; the suffering in the realms of misery; the suffering rooted in one's samsāric past; the suffering to be encountered in one's samsāric future; and the suffering rooted in the search for nutriment. See Sv III 795,6-9, Ps I 298,24-28, Spk III 163,23-26, Mp II $68,9-12$.

188 Mp: "Based on release (vavassaggārammanam karitvā): release is nibbāna. The meaning is: having made that the object. Gain concentration (labhanti samädhim): they obtain concentration of the path and concentration of the fruit." I am not sure the expression vavassaggārammanam karitvā need be interpreted in the technical sense (employed in the Abhidhamma) of the path and fruition cittas taking nibbāna as their object. The expression is also used in the definition of the concentration faculty at SN 48:9-10 (V 197,14-16, V 198,24-25). It may originally have meant simply a state of samädhi motivated by the aspiration for release. In SN, the noble eightfold path, the seven enlightenment factors, and
five spiritual faculties are often described as vossaggaparimāniṃ, "evolving toward release" or "maturing in release," vossagga and vavassagga being alternative forms of the same word.

189 Mp identifies the "taste of the meaning" (attharasa) with the four fruits, the "taste of the Dhamma" (dhammarasa) with the four paths, and the taste of liberation (vimuttirasa) with the deathless nibbāna (amatanibbāna). See 8:19: "This Dhamma and discipline has but one taste, the taste of liberation" (ayam dhammavinayo ekaraso vimuttiraso). Again, Mp seems to impose on the sutta technical distinctions formulated only in a later period.

190 Ce and Be, which I follow, count thirty suttas in this group. Ee merges them into one.

191 These suttas correspond closely to SN 56:102-31, V 474-77.

192 Ee treats these suttas as the beginning of vagga XX, Jhänavagga, "The Jhāna Chapter." Ce treats them as the fifth subchapter of vagga XVI, designated Sołasapasādakaradhammā, "Sixteen Qualities Engendering Confidence." Be groups them as vagga XVII, named Pasādakaradhammavagga, "Chapter on Qualities Engendering Confidence."

193 The observances in 1:378-381 are ascetic practices (dhutanga) permitted by the Buddha.

194 Ee treats this as a continuation of vagga $X X$. Ce takes it to be the sixth subchapter of vagga XVI, but gives it a separate name, as if it were a new chapter, Accharāsanghātavaggo, "The Finger Snap Chapter." Be counts it as vagga XVIII, called Aparaaccharāsanghātavaggo, "Another Finger Snap Chapter." In Be, vagga VI is "The First Finger Snap Chapter."

195 These are the four jhānas followed by the four divine dwellings (brahmavihāra).

196 These are the four establishments of mindfulness (satipaṭthāna), followed by the other groups in the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment: the four right strivings (sammappadhāna), the four bases for psychic potency (iddhipāda), the five faculties (indriya), the five powers (bala), the seven factors of enlightenment (bojjhanga), and the noble eightfold path (ariya atthangika magga).

197 The Pāli phrase kāye kāyānupassī viharati is usually translated either as I have rendered it here or as "[he] dwells contemplating the body as a body." The question is sometimes raised which of these two is more accurate. I believe that 7:6, IV 13-15, supports my rendering here. We there read ekacco puggalo sabbasainkha $\bar{r} e s u$ anccanupassī viharati, and in the following suttas: sabbasainkhāresu dukkhānupassī viharati, sabbadhammesu anattānupassī viharati, and nibbāne sukhānupassī viharati. These are best rendered: "Some persōn dwells contemplating impermanence in all conditioned
phenomena," "dwells contemplating suffering in all conditioned phenomena," "dwells contemplating non-self in all phenomena," and "dwells contemplating happiness in nibbāna." They could not be rendered: "Some person dwells contemplating impermanence as all conditioned phenomena"..."contemplating happiness as nibbāna." In each case, the word conjoined with anupassit is the aspect that is contemplated, and the word in the locative case is the sphere in relation to which that aspect is contemplated. Analogously, in käye käyänupassī viharati, the käya conjoined with anupassī is the aspect that is contemplated (the "bodiness" of the body) and the locative käye is the domain in relation to which that aspect is contemplated. Strictly speaking käyänupassī does not actually mean "contemplating the body," but "a body-contemplator." Thus a very literal translation of the phrase would be: "He dwells as a body-contemplator in relation to the body." Since such a rendering would sound awkward in English, I fall back on the familiar "contemplating the body in the body." Similar considerations apply to the other three satipaṭthannas.

198 These are the eight bases of overcoming (abhibhāyatana). For explanations, see 8:65 and pp. 1808-9, notes 1771-75.

199 These are the eight emancipations (vimokkha). See 8:66 and pp. $1809-10$, notes $1776-80$.

200 A kasina is an object, often a disk, used as a support for meditation. For example, the earth kasina is a disk of brown clay on which the meditator focuses to obtain an inner perception of earth. For full explanations, see Vism chaps. 4 and 5. Ce adds $\bar{a} l o k a k a s i n a$, the light kasina, which is not in Be and Ee.

201 1:480-84 are five of the ten "foul" or unattractive objects (asubhärammana) discussed at Vism 178-79, Ppn 6.1-11.

202 For clarity's sake, I have slightly expanded the extremely compressed Pāli text.

203 Following this, Ee includes ten more suttas, obtained by taking saddhindriyam bhāveti (and the other four indriya) and saddhābalam bhāveii (and the other four bala) without associating them with a jhāna or brahmavihāra. This is not matched by Ce or Be and is thus likely to be an editorial error.

204 This number agrees with Be. Ee counts this as vagga XXI, Ce as the seventh subchapter of vagga XVI, but separately titled Käyagatāsativaggo, "The Chapter on Mindfulness Directed to the Body."

205 In this sutta and those that follow, käyagatāsati should surely be understood in the broad sense of the Kāyagatāsati Sutta (MN 119), as comprising all meditation exercises based on the body,
rather than in the narrow sense of Vism 240, Ppn 8.44, which restricts it to contemplation of the thirty-two bodily parts.

Mp: "Wholesome qualities that pertain to true knowledge (kusala dhammā ye keci vijjābhägiyā): There are eight kinds of true knowledge: insight knowledge, the mind-made body, and the six kinds of direct knowledge (see, e.g., 3:101, 6:2). The qualities associated with these eight are the things that pertain to true knowledge. Or, if one of the eight is taken to be true knowledge, the others are 'qualities that pertain to true knowledge.'" At 2:31, samatha and vipassanā are said to be the two things that pertain to true knowledge.

206 See above, note 187.

207. Ce and Ee count four separate suttas here, each based on one of the benefits that come from developing mindfulness of the body, whereas Be combines them into one. The use of the conjunction pi after each item seems to corroborate Be, which I follow.

208. Ee counts two suttas here, one based on the non-arising of unarisen unwholesome qualities, the other on the abandoning of arisen unwholesome qualities. Ce and Be, which I follow, take this to be one sutta.

209. Again, Ee counts this as two suttas, but I follow Ce and Be in taking it as one.

210 Here I follow Ce and Ee in taking this passage as five suttas, whereas Be treats it as one. On the seven underlying tendencies (anusaya), see 7:11, 7:12; on the ten fetters (samyojana), See 10:13.

211 Mp glosses paññāpabhedāya with paññāya pabhedagamanatthami. At Paṭis-a III 644,6-7, paññāpabhedakusalo is glossed "skilled in his own infinite distinctions" (attano anantavikappe ...cheko). Its near synonym, pabhinnañāno, is explained as "having knowledge that has attained infinite differentiations" (anantappabhedapattañāno). Mp glosses anupädāparinibbāna with apaccayaparinibbānassa sacchikiriyatthāya, "for the purpose of realizing the non-conditioned final nibbāna."

212 Mp explains "penetration of numerous elements" (anekadhātupativedha) as the penetration of the characteristics (lakkhaña) of the eighteen elements; "penetration of the diversity of elements" (nānādhātupativedha) as penetration of the characteristics of those eighteen elements by way of their diversity (nānäbhāvena); and "analytical knowledge of numerous elements" (anekadhātupatisambhidā) as the knowledge that classifies elements thus: "When this element is prominent, that occurs." MN 115, III 62-63, explains various ways in which a bhikkhu can be called "skilled in elements" (dhātukusala), all of which may be pertinent to the present passage.

213 See SN V 411-12. Mp offers explanations of these terms based on Patis II 189-202.

214 I follow Be, which treats this as a separate vagga. Ee takes it to be a continuation of its vagga XXI. Ce treats it as the eighth subchapter of its vagga XVI.

215 Ce and Ee take each of the twelve matching pairs in this vagga to be separate suttas, thus counting twenty-four suttas. I follow Be, which takes each pair of propositions to be a single sutta and thus counts only twelve suttas.

# NOTES TO THE TWOS

216 Mp gives detailed explanations of all these punishments. I translate only the first few and leave the rest to the reader's imagination. (1) The porridge pot (bilangathälika): they crack open his skull, take up a hot iron ball with tongs, put the ball inside, and boil his brains until they overflow. (2) The polished-shell shave (sañkhamundika): they cut the skin [in the area] bounded by his upper lip, the roots of the ears, and gullet, bind all his head hairs into a knot, tie them around a stick, and pull it up, so that his skin together with his head hairs comes off; then they rub his skull with coarse sand and wash it, until it becomes the color of a conch shell. (3) Rāhu's mouth (rähumukha): they force open his mouth with a spike and burn a lamp inside his mouth, or they dig into his mouth with a spade until the blood flows and fills his mouth. (4) The fiery wreath (jotimalika): they wind an oiled cloth around his entire body and ignite it. (5) The flaming hand (hatthapajjotika): they wind an oiled cloth around his hand and ignite it so that it burns like a lamp.

217 Mp : "Even if a bundle of a thousand [gold pieces] had fallen along the road, he would not steal it thinking to support himself with it, but he would turn it over with his heel and go his way, thinking: 'What need do I have with this?'"

218 Both Ce and Be read pāpako dukkho vipāko here, as against Ee pāpako vipāko.

219 Sabbūpadhipatinissagga. Mp specifies three types of "acquisitions" (upadhi): the five aggregates, the defilements, and volitional activities (khandha, kilesa, abhisankhärā). The relinquishment of these is a synonym for nibbāna. The striving for this is the energy arisen along with insight and the path.

220 The two things that cause torment (dhammā tapanīya) are not expressly stated as such in the text, but it is clear that they are (1) engaging in misconduct, and (2) failing to engage in good
conduct. The same applies, with appropriate changes, to the following sutta.

221 Mp: "By non-contentment in regard to wholesome qualities (asantutthitia kusalesu dhammesu) he shows: 'Not being content merely with jhāna or the luminous mark [of concentration], I aroused the path of arahantship. Until that arose, I was not content. And being dissatisfied in striving, I strove on, standing firm without retreating.' 'Indefatigability' (appativānita) means not turning back, not retreating. By I strove indefatigably, what is meant is this: 'When I was a bodhisatta, I strove on, not retreating, aspiring for omniscience.'"

222 This determination is found elsewhere in the Nikāyas: in AN at 8:13 58, IV 190,8-12; MN 70.27, I 481,1-5; and SN 12:22, II 28,24-28.

223 Mp : "Heedfulness (appamäda) consists in non-separation from mindfulness. Unsurpassed security from bondage (anuttara yogakkhema): by heedfulness he attained not only enlightenment but also unsurpassed security from bondage, consisting in the fruit of arahantship and nibbāna."

224 See SN 12:53, II 86; SN 12:54, II 87; SN 12:57-59, II 89-91.

225 Moral shame (hiri) is disgust at bodily and verbal misconduct; moral dread (ottappa) is moral dread over such misconduct. Moral shame is directed inwardly. It arises from self-respect and induces one to reject wrongdoing based on the sense of one's own inherent dignity. Moral dread has an outward direction. It arises from fear of blame and induces one to reject wrongdoing based on fear of the consequences. For more details, see CMA 86, As 124-25, and Vism 464,31-465,4, Ppn 14.142.

226 Mātucchā is one's maternal aunt; mātulāni, the wife of one's mother's brother. For simplicity's sake I refer to them jointly as "aunts."

227 Vassūpanayikā. The three-month rains residence is observed by monastics during the Indian rainy season. During this period, bhikkhus and bhikkhunis must remain for three months at their chosen place of residence, though they are permitted to leave for up to seven days if there is a suitable reason. The earlier threemonth rains period extends from the day after the full moon of Āsātha (normally occurring in July or early August) to the full moon of Kattika (normally in October or early November). The later three-month rains period begins and ends one month after the earlier one.

228 Here, in contrast to 2:1, both Ce and Be read simply pāpako vipāko, without dukkho.

229 Ce sekhametam balam; Be sekhānametam balam; Ee sekhānam etam balam. Mp: "The power of knowledge of the seven kinds of
trainees." The seven kinds of trainees extend from the person on the path of stream-entry through the person on the path of arahantship. Thus they include all the noble persons except the arahant, who is asekha, "one beyond training."

230 Sankhittena ca vitthārena ca. Mp: "A brief teaching is one expounded briefly by reciting the outline (matika). A detailed teaching is one expounded by elaborating and analyzing the outline (matikaṃ vitthārato vibhajitvā kathitā). But whether or not an outline is set up, a teaching spoken with elaboration and analysis is called a detailed teaching. The brief teaching is spoken for a person with great wisdom, a detailed teaching for a person whose intellect is blunter... Though the entire Tipitaka is a brief teaching, it is here considered a detailed teaching."

231 Mp mentions the four kinds of disciplinary issues: involving a dispute (vivädädhikarana), involving an accusation (anuvädädhikarana), involving an offense (äpattädhikarana), and involving procedure (kiccädhikarana). These are dealt with in detail at Vin II 88-92. Briefly, an issue involving a dispute arises when monks or nuns dispute about the Dhamma and the Vinaya; an issue involving an accusation arises when they accuse another member of committing a transgression; an issue involving an offense arises when a monk or nun who has committed a transgression seeks rehabilitation; and an issue involving procedure deals with the collective procedures of the Sangha. Methods for settling disciplinary issues (adhikaranasamatha) are explained at MN 104.12-20, II 247-50. See too Thā̄nissaro 2007a: 546-61.

232 Aham kho akusalam āpanno kañcideva desam kāyena. Mp: "Here, by 'what is unwholesome' (akusalam), an offense (āpatti) is intended; the meaning is 'I have committed an offense.' 'A particular misdeed' (kañcideva desam): not every offense, but a particular kind of offense; the meaning is 'a certain offense."

233 Suñkadāyakan va bhandasmiṃ. I have elaborated slightly on the terse Pāli expression to bring out the sense. Mp: "A crime is incurred by one importing taxable goods when he avoids the taxation station, and he is the criminal in this case, not the kings or their employees."

234 Mp explains that the two faults on the part of the reproving monk are being overcome by displeasure and reproving the other because of his displeasure. The three faults on the part of the monk being reproved are committing the offense, being displeased, and informing others.

235 Conduct contrary to the Dhamma (adhammacariya) and conduct in accordance with the Dhamma (dhammacariya) are explained briefly in the following sutta. At 10:220 and 10:217 they are
respectively identified with the ten courses of unwholesome kamma and the ten courses of wholesome kamma.

236 Mp explains that the brahmin had approached the Buddha out of pride, intending to find fault with the teaching. The Buddha knew this and understood that the brahmin would benefit only if he were prompted by an ambiguous reply to inquire further. Since the Buddha first stated the cause of rebirth in heaven in the same terms as he stated the cause of rebirth in hell, the brahmin had to admit his perplexity and ask for clarification. This humbled him, opening his mind to understanding.

237 Be divides this sutta into two, whereas Ce and Fe , which I follow, treat the passages on the disappearance and the continuation of the Dhamma as contrasting parts of a single sutta.

238 Dunnikkhittañca padabyañjanam attho ca dunnito.

239 Sunikkhittañca padabyañjanam attho ca sunito.

240 Also at SN 11:24, I 239,26-31, where it is embedded in a story and embellished with a verse.

241 Mp: "The former is exemplified by Sunakkhatta, who said: 'The ascetic Gotama does not have any superhuman qualities' (at MN 12.2, I 68,9-10). The latter is exemplified by a devotee whose faith is destitute of understanding, such as one who misrepresents the Tathägata by claiming: 'The Buddha is entirely world-transcending (buddho nama sabbalokuttaro); all the parts of his body, such as the head hairs, are world-transcending.'" This latter comment seems to be a dig at the Lokottaravädins, a subsect of the Mahāsämghikas that held the Buddhas to be entirely world-transcendent.

242 Ee divides this into two separate suttas by way of the two paragraphs, whereas Ce and Be take it as one.

243 The question of which discourses of the Buddha are of explicit meaning (nitattha) and which require interpretation (heyyattha) became one of the most intensely debated issues in Buddhist hermeneutics. Starting with the early Indian Buddhist schools, the debate continued in such later Mahāyāna sūtras as the Aksayamatinirdeśa and the Samdhinirmocana. The controversy continued even beyond India, in Sri Lanka, China, and Tibet. The Pāli commentaries decide this issue on the basis of the Abhidhamma distinction between ultimate realities and conventional realities.

Mp: "Those suttas that speak of one person (puggia), two persons, etc., require interpretation, for their meaning has to be interpreted in the light of the fact that in the ultimate sense a person does not exist (paramatthato pana puggalo nāma natthi). One who misconceives the suttas that speak about a person, holding
that the person exists in the ultimate sense, explains a discourse whose meaning requires interpretation as one whose meaning is explicit. A sutta whose meaning is explicit is one that explains impermanence, suffering, and non-self; for in this case the meaning is simply impermanence, suffering, and non-self. One who says, 'This discourse requires interpretation,' and interprets it in such a way as to affirm that 'there is the permanent, there is the pleasurable, there is a self,' explains a sutta of explicit meaning as one requiring interpretation." The first criticism here is probably directed against the Puggalavadins, who held the person to be ultimately existent. The latter might have been directed against an early form of the tathāgatagarbha theory, which (in the Mahāyāna Parinirvāna Sūtra) affirmed a permanent, blissful, pure self.

244 Mp interprets "concealed action" (paticchannakamma) simply as a bad deed, explaining that even if a bad deed is not concealed, it is still called a concealed action. However, it seems that confessing one's bad deed and making amends for it would mitigate its negative force. See Dhp 173: "One who has committed a bad deed but covers it up with good illumines this world like the moon freed from a cloud."

245 Ee combines this sutta and the next two into one, whereas Ce and Be keep them separate. I suspect that Ee rightly joins 2:27 and 2:28, two complementary discourses, but errs in including 2:29, which has a different theme. Still, I defer to Ce and Be. Note that 2:26 and 2:29 join into one sutta two contrasting statements about the two types of rebirth respectively resulting from bad and good conduct.

246 Patiggāha. An unusual use of this word. Mp says simply that these two states receive (patigganhanti) the immoral person.

247 Araññavanapatthāni pantāni senāsanāni. I follow Mp, which explains araññavanapatthāni as a dvanda compound: araññāni ca vanapatthāni ca.

248 Pacchimañca janatam anukampamāno. Ps I 129,4-12, commenting on the same expression at MN I 23,35, says: "How does he show compassion for later generations by dwelling in the forest? When young men who have gone forth out of faith see that even the Blessed One-who had nothing more to understand, abandon, develop, and realize-did not neglect dwelling in the forest, they will think that they, too, should dwell in the forest. Thus they will quickly make an end of suffering."

249 Vijjābhāgiyā. See 1:575.

250 For more on the relationship of serenity (samatha) and insight (vipassanā), see 4:92-94 and 4:170.

251 Mp interprets the mind being developed as the "mind of the path" (maggacitta) and the wisdom being developed as the "wisdom of the path" (maggapañ $\tilde{n} \bar{a}$ ). However, it seems to me that the text itself intends "mind" and "wisdom" generically, not specifically as the mind and wisdom of the noble path attainment. The development of the mind through samatha and of wisdom through vipassanā, however, culminate in the "taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom" (anāsavā cetovimutti paññāvimutti), the final goal of the Dhamma. Here, samatha is the condition for liberation of mind and vipassana for liberation by wisdom.

252 I read with Ce and Ee katañca hoti patikatañca atikatañca $\bar{a}$ ti. Be ends at patikatañca $\bar{a} t i$.

253 The operative terms here are kiriyavāda and akiriyavāda. For the Buddhist critique of akiriyavāda, a doctrine that denied the validity of ethical distinctions, see MN 60.13, I 404,21-35; MN 76.10, I 516,3-17. The present sutta seems to be extracted from 8:12 §§1-2.

254 Mp : "The 'trainee' (sekha) refers to the seven trainees [from the one on the path of stream-entry to the one on the path of arahantship]. But the virtuous worldling (stlavantaputhujjana) can also be included under the stream-enterer."

255 Mp has a long preamble to its commentary on this sutta, explaining how throngs of lay devotees from Sāvatthī spontaneously assembled at the Eastern Park to hear Sāriputta speak. The devas, too, realizing that Sāriputta was about to deliver a momentous discourse, arrived from multiple celestial realms and from thousands of world systems to listen. Sarriputta exercised a feat of psychic power such that even those at the back of the crowd, and the devas at the far edge of the world system, could clearly see him and hear his voice.

256 Mp: "The person fettered internally (ajjhattasamyojanam puggalam): The 'internal' (ajjhattam) is sense-sphere existence; the 'external' (bahiddha) is form and formless existence. Desire and lust for 'the internal,' consisting in sense-sphere existence, is called the internal fetter. Desire and lust for 'the external,' consisting in form and formless existence, is called the external fetter. Or, alternatively, the five lower fetters are the internal fetter, and the five higher fetters are the external fetter. The persons being spoken of as internally fettered and externally fettered are not the multitude of ordinary worldly people still attached to the round of existence, but noble disciples-stream-enterers, once-returners, and non-returners-who are distinguished as twofold by way. of their mode of existence."

It is striking that the Chinese parallel MĀ 21 (at T I 448c23-25) interprets these two persons in a way diametrically opposite to the Pāli version: "In this world there are two kinds of people. Which two? The person with an internal fetter, the non-returner, who does not come back to this world. And the person with an external fetter, one who is not a non-returner but comes back to this world" (世䆣有二種人。云何為二。有内結人阿那含。不還此間。有外結人非阿那含。還來此間). The explanations that follow in MĀ 21 are consistent with this opening statement.

257. Mp: "Who returns to this state of being (āgantā itthattam): He returns to this state of the human five aggregates. Or else, he is not reborn in that heavenly realm or in some higher realm; but he comes back to a lower realm. By this factor, what is discussed are the lower two paths and fruits [of stream-entry and oncereturning] attained by a bhikkhu who is a dry-insight meditator using the elements as meditation subject (sukkhavipassakassa dhātukammatṭhānikabhikkhuno)."

258. Mp: "A certain peaceful liberation of mind (aññataram santam cetovimuttim): the fourth jhāna among the eight meditative attainments; for that is peaceful because it stills the opposing defilements, and it is a liberation of mind because it is liberated from those defilements."

259 Mp: "He is reborn in an order of devas among the pure abodes (suddhāvāsa). He does not return to this state of the human five aggregates, nor is he reborn in a lower realm. Either he is reborn in a higher realm or he attains final nibbāna right there. By this factor, what is discussed are the three paths and fruits [up to non-returning] of a bhikkhu working at concentration (samādhikammikassa bhikkhuno)."

260 Mp : "At this point, what is discussed is the stream-enterer's and once-returner's insight [undertaken] to destroy lust for the five objects of sensual pleasure and [to reach] the path of nonreturning (anāgāmimaggavipassanā)."

261 Mp : "By this, what is discussed is the non-returner's insight [undertaken] to destroy lust for existence and [to reach] the path of arahantship (arahattamaggavipassanā)."

262 Mp sees the practice for the destruction of craving (tanhākkhaya) as again referring to the stream-enterer's and once-returner's insight to reach the path of non-returning, and the practice for the destruction of greed (lobhakkhaya) as again referring to the non-returner's insight to reach the path of arahantship. It would be peculiar for such a distinction to be intended here. Since both craving (tanhā) and greed (lobha) can refer to the desire for continued existence (bhavataṇhā, bhavarāga), and since
it seems improbable that, after alluding to the highest realization, Sāriputta would then revert to a lower level, this sentence may simply be continuing the description of one practicing to attain arahantship.

263 Mp : "[Sāriputta] has discussed insight under six headings: (1) the lower two paths and fruits of the dry-insight meditator who uses the elements as his meditation subject; (2) the three paths and fruits of one who works at concentration; (3) the stream-enterer's and once-returner's insight to destroy sensual lust [and reach] the path of non-returning; (4) the non-returner's insight to destroy lust for existence [and reach] the path of arahantship; (5) the stream-enterer's and once-returner's insight for 'the destruction of craving'--that is, craving for sensual pleasure-and to reach the path of non-returning; and (6) the non-returner's insight for 'the destruction of greed'-that is, greed for existence-and [to reach] the path of arahantship. At the conclusion of the discourse, deities numbering hundreds of thousand of kotis (a koți $=$ ten million) attained arahantship, and there was no counting the number of those who became stream-enterers and so forth."

264 Mp explains samacitta to mean "with the same mind," thereby resolving an ambiguity in the Pāli term. Though in Skt the difference between sama $=$ "peace" and sama $=$ "same, equal" would have been clear, in most dialects of Middle Indo-Aryan (including Pāli) the two words would be indistinguishable and thus their meanings could be conflated. Mp construes sama as equivalent to Skt sama, "same, equal": "They are called 'sameminded' because of the similarity in the subtlety of their mind (cittassa sukhumabhāvasamataya samacitta); for they had created their own bodies with minds of similar subtlety (sukhume citta-sarikkhake katva)." Mp gives other explanations of samacitta, but all assume the meaning is "with the same mind." The Chinese parallel (at TI 449b1) reads 等心天 = "same-minded deities," thus agreeing with Mp. This indicates that the original on which the Chinese translation was based either had samacitta in a language that made a distinction between sama and sama, or, if preserved in a language that did not make such a distinction, had been accompanied by an explanation of the term as meaning "sameminded." However, the expressions santindriya and santamānasā toward the end of the sutta, both related to the Skt sama, suggest that the original meaning could have been "peaceful minded," unless ambivalence was deliberate.

265 Anukampam upädāya. Mp: "Not out of compassion for Sāriputta, for on that occasion there was no need to show compassion for the elder [Sāriputta] ... who had already reached the perfection
of a disciple's knowledge. Rather, they ask the Blessed One to go out of compassion for the other devas and humans who had assembled there." Despite the commentary, it may be the case that the devas actually wanted the Buddha to approach Sāriputta for his own sake. Sāriputta probably did not have the supernor. mal ability to see the hosts of devas that had assembled to hear him speak and thus the Buddha had to inform him of this. At Ud 40,28-29, Sāriputta says that he does not even see a mud sprite (mayaṃ pan'etarahi pamsupisācakampi na passāma).

266 Mp: "It was right here (idh'eva): It was in this human world and under this teaching that those deities had developed their minds in such a way that they were reborn in a peaceful form-sphere existence. Having come from there, they have created subtle bodies. While those deities might have reached three paths and fruits in Buddha Kassapa's teaching, because all Buddhas have the same teaching, with the words 'right here' he refers to the teaching as one." The Chinese parallel is more explicit than the Pāli: "It was in the past when they were human beings that those same-minded deities developed such a wholesome mind, such an extremely vast and great mind."

267 Santindriyā bhavissāma santamānasā. As noted in note 264 above, the repeated use of the word santa here and just below suggests that samacitta, in relation to the deities, could have meant "peaceful minded"-this despite the agreement between Mp and the Chinese translation on "same-minded."

268 Kāmarāgäbhinivesavinibandhapaligedhapariyutṭhānajjhosānahetu. I render the compound following Mp's resolution: kāmarāgābhinivesahetu, kāmarāgavinibandhahetu, kāmarāgapaligedhahetu, kāmarāgapariyutṭhānahetu, kāmarāga-ajjhosānahetu. The same applies to the long compound on ditthi.

269 The same charge is leveled against the Buddha himself in 4:22 and 8:11.

270 I follow Ce and Be kāmamajjhāvasati (= kāmaṃ ajjhāvasati), as against Ee kāmamajjhe vasati.

271 Tuṇhībhūtā tuṇhībhūtā va sañghamajjhe sañkasāyanti. Mp: "Sitting silently in the midst of the Sangha, they are unable to open their mouths and utter even a single word, but just sit there as if brooding."

272 Here and below reading with Ce and Ee bhajanti.

273 Reading with Be yena vā pana tenu pakkamanti. Ce and Ee read papatanti, which does not fit as well.

274 See SN 45:24, V 18-19.

275 Nāyaṃ dhammam kusalaṃ. Mp: "The path together with insight."

276 Duggahitehi suttantehi byañjanappatirūpakehi. For -patirūpaka
as meaning "counterfeit, a semblance, of misleading appearance," see such expressions as amitto mittapatirūpako at DN III 185-86; sakkapatirūpako at SN I 230,16; jātarūpappatirūpakaṃ and saddhammappatirūpakam at SN II 224,10-17. Here the compound probably means the same as dunnikkhittam padabyañjanam at 2:20 above. See too 4:160 (II 147,21) and 5:156 (III 178,26). Mp takes dhamma here to mean the text (pāli), commenting: "They exclude the meaning and text of well-acquired discourses and elevate above them the meaning and text of their badly acquired discourses."

277 Be reads here suggahitehi suttantehi byañjanappatirūpakehi (Ee vyañjanapatirūpakehi). Ce, however, which I follow, uses the negative: suggahitehi suttantehi na byañjanapatirūpakehi. Ce may have added $n a$ to convey the required sense, but without it the sentence seems self-contradictory.

278 Here and in the following the text uses etadaggam.

279 As PED notes, Pāli vagga represents two distinct Skt words: varga, meaning "group," such as a group of suttas; and vyagra, the opposite of samagra, "divided" as opposed to "harmonious." Here, the latter vagga is evidently meant.

280 Ditthānugatim āpajjati. Lit., "follow in accord with what is seen (diṭtha)." This does not mean "follow in accord with their view (diṭthi)." Mp: "Doing what was done by their preceptors and teachers, they follow in accord with the practice they have seen."

281 In Pāli the foremost of these (etadaggam) is the assembly of the foremost (aggavatī parisā).

282 Mp : "The four paths and four fruits are discussed by means of the four truths."

283 These are the four wrong motives, mentioned as such at 4:17-20.

284 For the meaning of ukkācita I follow DOP, p. 387, which defines it as "boasting, empty talk," and ukkācitavintta as "trained in empty talk." I use "vain talk" rather than "empty talk," since the talk considered worthy here is precisely talk about emptiness. Vibh 352.(Be 8862) includes ukkācanā in a definition of lapanā, which suggests that ukkācanā is a tool of persuasion. See too Vism 27,1922, Ppn 1.74. In the present sutta ukkācita seems to have a different nuance, perhaps elegant but hollow talk.

285 Also at SN 20:7, II 267,6-15. For "connected with emptiness" (suññatāpatisamyuttā), Mp says: "Like the Connected Discourses on the Unconditioned, disclosing mere phenomena empty of a sentient being" (sattasuññam dhammamattameva pakāsakā asankhatasamyuttasadisā). Since the Asankhatasamyutta (SN
chap. 43) does not speak of "mere phenomena," perhaps Mp actually means the Salāyatanasamyutta (esp. SN 35:85, IV 54).

286 Mp : "That values worldly things (ämisagaru): one that values the four requisites and regards the world-transcending Dhamma as inferior. That values the good Dhamma (saddhammagaru): one that values the nine world-transcending dhammas (the four paths, four fruits, and nibbāna), and regards the four requisites as inferior."

287 The first seven are disciples who have reached the worldtranscending paths and fruits. For formal explanations, see MN. 70.14-21, I 477-79. The latter two are respectively the good person and the bad person who have not reached the path.

288 Be lacks the two sentences beginning respectively, "It is because it is unrighteous" and (below) "It is because it is righteous." They occur in Ce and Ee.

289 Adhikaranaṃ. Mp: "The four kinds of disciplinary issues, disputes and so forth." See p. 1623, note 231 above.

290 Mp : "Because the wheel-turning monarch is mentioned, the phrase, 'out of compassion for the world' (lokānukampāya) is not used." On the wheel-turning monarch (rāja cakkavatī), see p. 1613, note 156 .

291 Pāli thūpa, a memorial mound.

292 Paccekabuddha is defined at Pp 14,16-20 (Be §23), as "a person who, in regard to things not heard before, awakens to the [four noble] truths by himself but does not attain all-knowledge regarding them or mastery over the powers" (ekacco puggalo pubbe ananussutesu dhammesu sāmaṃ saccāni abhīsambujjhati; na ca tattha sabbaññutaṃ pāpunāti, na ca balesu vasībhāvam, ayaṃ vuccati puggalo paccekabuddho).

293 Mp : "The arahant is not terrified because he has abandoned personal-existence view (sakkāyadiṭthiyā pahīnattā); the thoroughbred elephant, because his personal-existence view is very strong (sakkāyadiṭthiyā balavattā)."

294 Kimpurisā, a mythical class of beings in Indian folklore.

295 Mp : "By 'should not correct me,' this is meant: 'He should not give me exhortation or instruction; he should not correct me.'"

296 No ti nam vadeyyam. Mp: "I would then say to him, 'I will not do what you say,' and I would trouble him by not doing what he says."

297 Ubhato vacīsamsāro. The expression is unusual. Mp explains that on both sides the talk continues (samsaramānā) as they verbally attack one another.

298 Ce reads here ajjhattam na avūpasantam hoti, "not unsettled internally," which means in effect that the disturbance is settled; that
is precisely the opposite of what the context requires. Older Sinhala-script editions, referred to in the notes to Ce , read ajjhattaṃ na suvūpasantam hoti, "not well settled internally," which makes better sense. Be and Ee read ajjhattaṃ avūpasantam hoti, supported by the lemma of Mp (Ce and Be). I thus translate on the basis of this reading. Similarly, in the following paragraph, Ce reads ajjhattaṃ avūpasantam hoti, again the opposite of what the context requires. I take as the basis for my rendering there Be and Ee ajjhattaṃ na suvūpasantam hoti.

299. Ce treats this paragraph as a separate sutta. Be and Ee, which I follow, treat the two paragraphs as a single sutta. Unless the two paragraphs are taken in this way, there is no dyad here justifying their inclusion in the Twos.

300. I read with Be pabbajitasukham, as against Ce and Ėe pabbajjāsukham. The contrast between gihi and pabbajita seems more logical than that between gihi and pabbajja.

301. Upadhisukha and nirupadhisukha. On upadhi, see p. 1621, note 219. Mp glosses the former as the happiness of the three planes (sense-sphere, form, and formless planes). It glosses the latter as world-transcending happiness (lokuttarasukha).

302. The contrast is between sämisam sukham, which Mp defines as defiled happiness that leads back to the round [of existence], and nirämisam sukham, undefiled happiness that leads to the end of the round.

303 Mp : "The happiness with rapture (sappitikam sukham) is the happiness of the first and second jhānas. The happiness without rapture (nippitikam sukham) is the happiness of the third and fourth jhānas."

304 Mp. "Pleasurable happiness (sattasukha) is the happiness of the first three jhānas. The happiness of equanimity (upekkhāsukha) is the happiness of the fourth jhāna."

305 Sappitikārammanam sukham and nippitikārammanam sukham. It is doubtful that, in the four Nikāyas, the word ārammana ever means "object of consciousness" in the general sense it has in the Abhidhamma and the commentaries. Its original meaning is closer to "basis" or "support." Occasionally, as in SN 34:5, III 266, the word designates a "meditation object." Over time, the meaning of ārammana must have broadened from "object of meditation" to "object of consciousness" in a general sense, but to my knowledge this development occurred after the period when the Nikāyas were compiled.

306 Mp: "The happiness based on form (rüpärammanaṃ sukham) is that based on the fourth jhana of the form sphere, or any that arises based on form. That based on the formless (arüpärammanaṃ
sukham) is that based on a formless jhāna, or any that arises based on the formless."

307 Mp: "With a basis' means 'with a reason.' The same method applies in the following suttas. For the words 'source,' 'cause,' 'causal activity,' 'condition,' and 'form' are all just synonyms for 'reason'" (Sanimittā ti sakārañā....Nidānam hetu sañkhāro paccayo rüpan ti sabbāni pi hi etāni kāranavevacanan'eva).

308 I follow the arrangement in Be and Ee. Ce does not place this sutta here, but because the key word is sasañkhāra, inserts it below, as the fourth among the suttas on the five aggregates. It seems that the text available to the commentator corresponded with Be, for Mp (both Ce and Be) explains that nimitta, nidāna, hetu, sañkhāra, and paccaya are synonymous.

309 Mp: "Liberation of mind (cetovimutti) is the concentration of the fruit [of arahantship], liberation by wisdom (paññāvimutti) is the wisdom of the fruit." This interpretation assumes that the two are conjoined, as in the expression anāsavam cetovimuttim paññāvimuttim. It is possible, however, for mundane cetovimutti to be attained independently of paññavimutti. For a discussion of the contrast between mundane and world-transcending types of cetovimutti, see MN 43.30-37, I 297-98, and SN 41.7, IV 295-97.

310 Be has these inverted.

311 Yo ca akappiye kappiyasaññī, yo ca kappiye akappiyasaññ. This refers to what is allowable and not allowable according to the rules of monastic discipline.

312 I translate based on Ce and Ee. Be inverts the two clauses, reading: Yo ca āpattiyā anāpattisaññī, yo:ca anāpattiyā āpattisaññī.

313 Here, too, Be inverts the clauses, reading: Yo ca āpattiyā āpattisaññī, yo ca anāpattiyā anāpattisaññī.

314 Here, again, I follow Ce and Ee over Be, which inverts the clauses.

315 Mp glosses $\bar{a} s \bar{a}$ here with $\operatorname{tanh} \bar{a}$.

316 Yo ca laddham laddham vissajjeti. Mp glosses: "He gives to others" (paresam deti). However, I think what is indicated by vissajjeti is not generosity but profligacy.

317 In relation to this and the following sutta, see 1:11, 1:12.

318 For explanations of these types of offenses, here and just below, see p. 1602, note 66.

319 Esā bhikkhave tulā etam pamānam. Mp: "Just as one weighing gold or grain uses a scale, taking that as the standard, the measure, or criterion, so this is the standard and criterion for my bhikkhu disciples, namely, Sāriputta and Moggallāna. It is possible to weigh or measure oneself by aspiring, 'May I be like them in regard to wisdom or psychic potency!' But not in any other way."

320 The two chief bhikkhuni disciples respectively in regard to wisdom and psychic potency. See 1:236, 1:237.

321 See 1:250, 1:251.

322 See 1:260, 1:262. The latter's name is also spelled Velukaṇtakiyā and Velukandaki.

323. Ce divides each statement about the fool and the wise person in 2:134-37 into two suttas, whereas Be and Ee treat them as contrasting parts of a single sutta. Thus where Be and Ee count four suttas here, Ce counts eight. Parallels in later nipatas (3:9, 4:3, 10:225-28) even in Ce support Be and Ee, which I therefore follow.

324. Ce mistakenly numbers the first paragraph of this sutta as 6 within the vagga, thus assigning 6 to two successive suttas. This should be corrected to 7 , and the following sutta numbers in the vagga should all be increased by one.

325. Mp mentions Devadatta in relation to the Tathāgata and Kokālika in relation to the chief disciples (see 10:89; also SN 6:9-10, I 14953; Sn 3:10, pp. 123-31; Vin II 196-200). On the positive side, Mp mentions respectively Ānanda, and the cowherd Nanda and the financier's son.

326 Sacittavodānañca na ca kiñci loke upādiyati. I mirror the text's dissonant mixture of grammatical forms.

327 Sangahā. See 4:32 and pp. 1684-85, note 687.

328 Anukampa. This is the word normally signifying active compassion or empathy, as contrasted with karunā, which usually signifies meditative compassion.

329 Santhāra. Mp explains this as if it meant "a covering" or "a spread," which it does in certain contexts: "The covering with material goods is spreading out by covering [the space] between oneself and others with the four requisites." More likely, however, santhāra here is nearly synonymous with patisanthāra, which occurs in the next sutta. In fact, Mp says that the difference between the two words is a mere prefix.

330 Ātitheyyāni. Mp glosses with āgantukadānāni, "gifts to a guest."

331 Mp: "Skillfulness in [entering] aimeditative attainment (samāpattikusalatā) is facility in entering the attainment after one has understood suitability in food and climate. Skillfulness in emerging from a meditative attainment (samāpattivutthānakusalatā) is skill in emerging at the predetermined time."

332. I here follow Ce and Ee, which count each of the five pairs as a separate sutta; Be counts each group as one sutta.

333. Be and Ce count the following suttas as a separate vagga, but Ee treats them as a continuation of vagga XVI.

334. Again, I follow Ce and Ee in counting each pair of unwholesome (and-belew, wholesome) qualities in this vagga as a separate
sutta, whereas Be counts each group of unwholesome and wholesome qualities as one sutta.

335 Ee counts this as vagga XVII and names it "Reasons" (Atthavasa). Be also treats it as an independent vagga, but Ce takes it as the second subchapter of its vagga XVII.

336 Ce counts ten separate suttas here, but I follow Be and Ee in taking them as one.

337 What follows here are all disciplinary regulations laid down in the Vinaya Pitaka.

338 Ee treats this as a continuation of vagga XVII, Ce and Be as an independent vagga but without a number.

# Notes to the Threes

339 Readings differ among the editions. Ce apadānasobhinī paññā, Be apadānasobhanī pañ̃̃ā, Ee apadāne subhati pañ̃̃ā. Mp: "The meaning is that the fool and the wise person are each known through their conduct" (bālā ca panditā ca attano attano cariten'eva pākaṭa honti ti attho).

340 Bālalakkhaṇāni bālanimittāni bālāpadānāni, Mp: "These are the means of recognition."

341 Ee omits this concluding exhortation in 3:3-7.

342 Mp. "Discordant (ananulomike) means not in conformity with the teaching. Gross 'discordant bodily action' is destroying life, etc.; or [more subtly] worshipping the directions or making offerings to the spirits. Gross 'discordant verbal action' is false speech, etc.; or [more subtly], if one does not wish to give to others, deceiving them by saying one does not have anything to give. Gross 'discordant mental action' is longing, etc.; or [more subtly], explaining a meditation subject incorrectly." Mp illustrates this with the story of the elder mentioned at Vism 296,12-16, Ppn 9.6, who taught a young man to meditate on loving-kindness toward his wife. As a result he was overcome by lust and beat against the walls of his meditation cell all night. I translate ananulomikesu dhammesu in accordance with Mp , but the word dhammesu can also mean "teachings," and it is possible that this was the original intention.

343 The second case, the understanding of the four noble truths, marks the attainment of stream-entry; the third, the destruction of the taints, is the attainment of arahantship.

344 These were all considered low occupations fit only for social outcasts. The candālas were the most despised community. Ce omits nesädukule vä, apparently by oversight, as Mp (both Ce and Be ) glosses it as "a family of deer hunters" (migaluddakānam kule).

345 Ce reads macalappatto; Ee -macalapatto; Be acalappatto. In 4:87 §1 we find samanamacalo, on which see p. 1694, note 778. Here Mp explains: "When the eldest-one due to be anointed but not yet anointed-is still an infant, he does not form any wish to be anointed. But when he reaches the age of sixteen and his beard begins to grow, he is called 'one who has attained the unshaken.' He is able to reign over a large realm, therefore [the Buddha] says 'one who has attained the unshaken.'"

346 Mp glosses dhamma here as "the Dhamma of the ten courses of wholesome kamma" (dasakusalakammapathadhammo). This is certainly too narrow, but it is clear that "Dhamma" here does not mean the Buddha's teaching as such. Rather, it is the universal principle of goodness and truth followed by virtuous people irrespective of their religious convictions. On the basis of this Dhamma the wheel-turning monarch provides righteous (dhammika) protection to all in his realm.

347 Mp : "He sets in motion the wheel just by means of the Dhamma of the ten courses of wholesome kamma." Ce and Be read the verb here as vatteti, but below, in relation to the Buddha, as pavatteti; Ee has pavatteti in relation to both. If vatteti is the original reading, the change in verbs may be intended to suggest that a wheelturning monarch does not initiate the rule of righteousness but continues the heritage of his forefathers, whereas a Buddha sets in motion the wheel of Dhamma previously unknown.

348 Kenaci manussabhūtena paccatthikena panninā. Lit. "by any hostile living being that has become human." Mp: "The deities, it is said, can do whatever they want. Therefore they are not included, but 'human being' is mentioned." This is in contrast with the Buddha, whose wheel cannot be turned back by any beings including the deities.

349 So Ce and Ee. Be gives the king's name as Sacetana.

350 Abhisankhārassa gati. An unusual use of the word abhisankhāra, which in more technical contexts denotes volitional activity that creates kamma. Mp glosses with payogassa gamanam, "the movement of (or due to) the effort."

351 Mp : "As if fixed on an axle: as if an axle had been inserted so that it stood still."

352 Apanṇakapatipadam. Mp gives a series of synonyms: "the unmistaken way, the definite way, the emancipating way, the causal way, the essential way, the exquisite way, the unopposed way, the conducive way, the way in accord with the Dhamma" (aviraddhapatipadam ekamsapatipadam niyyānikapatipadam kāranapatipadam sārapatipadam mandapatipadam apaccanikapatipadam anulomapatipadam dhammānudhammapatipadam). Apannaka, in
a similar sense, is found in AN at 4:71, 4:72, and 10:46. It also occurs as the title of MN 60. In relation to yoni c'assa araddha hoti asavānam khayāya, Mp explains that yoni can mean a section of the aggregates, a cause, or the vagina (khandhakoṭthāsa, kāraṇa, passāvamagga). Here, a cause is intended.

353 At SN 35:239, IV 175,26-30, too, it is said that by these three practices "one has laid the groundwork for the destruction of the taints."

354 Matikadharā. Mp glosses this as "experts on the two outlines" (dvemätikädharā), which Mp-t identifies as the bhikkhu and bhikkhunī mātikās (the Pātimokkhas for monks and nuns) or the mātikās of the Vinaya and Abhidhamma. The mātikās were lists of principles and practices that systematically represent the Dhamma. The mātikādhara are mentioned once in DN, twice in MN (in one sutta), not at all in SN, and twelve times in AN, which suggests that the suttas that refer to them are relatively late, or at least had been modified to accommodate them. On their nature and role, see Warder 1980: 218-24.

355 For formal explanations of these three types, see MN 70.17-19, I 478,4-479,3. All three classes are sekhas ranging from the streamenterer through one on the path to arahantship. As general classes, they differ, not in their position relative to the final goal, but in their dominant spiritual faculty. The body witness (kāyasakkhi) gives prominence to concentration and attains the "peaceful formless emancipations." One attained to view (ditthippatta) gives prominence to wisdom and does not attain the formless emancipations. One liberated by faith (saddhāvimutta) gives prominence to faith and does not attain the formless emancipations. Because these three categories comprise persons standing anywhere from stream-enterer to the path to arahantship, their members cannot be prejudged as superior and inferior merely by falling into a particular class. To make such judgments, one would have to know their standing in terms of the six levels they each comprise. The body witness, on attaining arahantship, becomes "liberated in both respects" (ubhatobhāgavimutta). The other two become "liberated by wisdom" (paññāvimutta). On the two types of arahant, see MN 70.15-16, I 477,24-478,3.

356 In the Pāli, each participant in the discussion repeats the opening statement about the three persons before expressing his own opinion. To avoid redundancy, I have deleted this repetition.

357 Ce has, for this case only, "a person attained to view is an arahant or one practicing for arahantship" (svāssa arahā vā arahattāya patipanno). Be and Ee, consistent with the previous two types, state only that this person is practicing the way to arahantship.

According to the typology of MN 70, a body witness, one liberated by faith, and one attained to view have not completely eliminated their asavas and therefore are not arahants.

Okkamati niyamam kusalesu dhammesu sammattam. This is a technical expression denoting entry upon the world-transcending path. Mp: "The fixed course [consisting in] rightness in wholesome qualities: rightness in wholesome qualities consisting in entry upon the path." Though "rightness in wholesome qualities" sounds redundant, what is intended is the harmony and strength of the wholesome qualities needed to enter the path of stream-entry. For more on this expression in AN, see 5:151-53 and 6:86-88. See too SN 25.1-10, III 225-28, which says that by entering the "fixed course of rightness" (sammattaniyama) one enters the noble plane and becomes either a dhammannusärī or a saddhänusärī.

359 Sabyabajjham käyasañkhāraṃ abhisankharoti, sabyäbajham vacīsañkhāraṃ abhisankharoti, sabyābajjham manosankhāraṃ abhisankharoti. Mp glosses sabyäbajjham, "afflictive," with sadukkham, "with suffering." The "activities" are volitional actions that create kamma.

360 Deva subhakinha. These are the deities in the divine realm corresponding to the third jhāna. See 4:123.

361 Mp: "Those in the lower world referred to here are the afflicted spirits with palaces (vemanikapeta). For at times they experience fortune, at times they experience their [painful] kamma; they undergo mixed pleasure and pain."

362 By understanding the four noble truths, the attainment of streamentry is indicated. The destruction of the taints, just below, marks the attainment of arahantship.

363 Tattha tattha paññāya anuggahessämi. Mp: "One assists with wisdom the aggregate of virtuous behavior in one or another respect by avoiding those things that are uncongenial and unhelpful to virtuous behavior and by cultivating those things that are congenial and helpful [to it]. The same method holds for the aggregates of concentration and wisdom." "Aggregate of virtuous behavior" (stlakkhandha) is spoken of in the sense of the assemblage of factors that constitute virtuous behavior, and so too tor the aggregates of concentration and wisdom.

364 This is the standard definition of false speech among the ten courses of unwholesome kamma, as at 10:176 $\$ 4$ of the unwholesome section. The explanation of "speech like flowers," just below, is the standard definition of truthful speech in the corresponding wholesome section.

365 Reading here dhanam with Ce and B. Ee dhammam is clearly wrong.

366 Mp explains the compound ahañkāramamañkāramānānusayā as "I-making by views, mine-making by craving, and the underlying tendency to conceit. These are the defilements in relation to oneself and others." Mp explains bahiddhā ca sabbanimittesu ("and all external objects") as the five sense objects, the eternalist (and other) views, the person, and Dhamma. It calls this samädhi the fruition attainment of arahantship (arahattaphalasamāpatti).

367 Sn 1048. The Pārāyana, the fifth and final chapter of the Suttanipāta, consists of a framing story and sixteen sections in each of which the Buddha answers the questions of the students of the elder brahmin Bāvāri. Verses from the Pārāyana are cited and explained elsewhere in AN and other Nikāyas, which testifies to its antiquity. It must have existed as an independent work before being incorporated into Sn. The Pārāyana is the subject of an ancient canonical commentary, the Cūlaniddesa, included in the Khuddaka Nikāya.

368 Ee takes this sutta to belong to the preceding one and thus assigns only one number to them. In Ce and Be, which I follow, it is separate. Thus from this point on my numbering exceeds Ee by one.

369 Sn 1106-7.

370 This is an allusion to the abandoning of the five hindrances, of which four are mentioned here.

371 Mp takes this to be the fruit of arahantship based on the fourth jhāna, which is suggested by the line upekkhāsatisamsuddham, echoing the stock formula for the fourth jhāna.

372 There are some differences in the readings: Ce ditthe vā dhamme, upapajje vā, apare vā pariyāye; Be ditthe vā dhamme upapajja vā apare vā pariyāye; Ee ditth' eva dhamme upapajje vā apare vā pariyāye. Mp says: "This is stated to show that the kamma is [of the type] either to be experienced in this present life, or to be experienced following rebirth, or to be experienced in some subsequent existence." For an Abhidhamma explanation of this triad, see CMA 205.

Some scholars have argued from the variant readings that only two alternatives are involved: either in this life or upon rebirth. However, I translate in accordance with the commentarial understanding. While the commentaries may be imposing a later interpretation on more archaic texts that asserted only two ways in which kamma can ripen, as a translator I feel responsible to the text that has been transmitted rather than to theories about a more archaic original. The recognition of a threefold ripening of kamma is not exclusive to the Theravāda school but is also found in the treatises of the Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma system. Definitions of the three types-for example, in
the Abhidharma Mahāvibhāṣā Śāstra at T XXVII 592a22-593b8, and in the Abhidharmakośa at T XXIX 81c10-16-are exactly the same as in the Pāli tradition and thus likely precede the division of the schools.

373 This statement has to be carefully interpreted. For an arahantwho has abandoned greed, hatred, and delusion-kamma created earlier, whether good or bad, is still capable of ripening during the final life. But because there is no more rebirth, with his passing all accumulated kamma from the past becomes defunct. Thus the intention of this statement is not that an arahant's past kamma cannot ripen while the arahant lives, but that it becomes defunct with the arahant's passing; for there will be no further continuum of existence within which its fruits might arise.

Brahmāli writes: "There must be a distinction here between 'non-greed' (alobha) and the situation when 'greed has vanished' (lobhe vigata). The former must refer to the motivation behind a particular action, the latter to the full uprooting of greed, attained only by the non-returner or even the arahant. Only in the light of this distinction does this statement make sense."

374 I read with Ce and Be mohajañ cāpaviddasu, as against Ee's mohajañ cāpi 'viddasu. Mp (both Ce and Be) also reads mohajañ cāpaviddasu, which it resolves into mohajañcāpi aviddasu. It paraphrases the meaning thus: "Whatever kamma the blind, ignorant worldling creates born of greed, hatred, and delusion-whether the kamma so fashioned be little or much-it is to be experienced right here (idh'eva tam vedaniyam), that is, it is to be experienced by the fool here in his very own being (idha sake attabhāveycva); this means that it ripens in his own individual being. There exists no other site [for it] (vatthum aññam na vijjati): there is no other site for the ripening of that kamma; for the kamma done by one person does not ripen in another's being."

375 Tasmā lobham ca dosam ca, mohajam cāpi viddasu. Ee reads the last pāda mohañ cāpi 'viddasu, which is missing a syllable. The text does lack a verb and direct object qualifed by mohajam. Mp supplies these in its paraphrase: "Therefore a wise person does not do that kamma born of greed and so forth" (yo vidu ... tam lobhajadibhedam kammam na karoti). It will be noted that Mp considers lobham and dosam to be truncated forms of lobhajam and dosajam, and I translate accordingly. For the verb, I see jahe of pāda d to implicitly extend up into pädas a and b, thus doing a dual service.

376 See 1:251.

377 Antaratṭhako himapätanasamayo. Mp: "A period of eight days when snow falls. It is the last four days of the month of Māgha and the first four days of Phagguna (roughly in mid-February)."

378 Similar verses are spoken to Anāthapindika at SN 10:8, I 212.

379 A version of this sutta is at MN 130, but with four divine messengers, beginning with birth.

380 Mp : "The old person, the sick one, and the corpse are called 'divine messengers' (devadüta) because they inspire a sense of urgency, as if warning one: 'Now you must go into the presence of death.'"

381 The legendary god of death and the judge of one's future destiny.

382 Reading with Ce dukkhā tibbā khaṭukā vedanā. Be and Ee add a fourth adjective, kharā.

383 I read with Ee te khemappattā sukhitā. Ce te khoppattā sukhitā and Be te appamattā sukhino are both faulty.

384 The eighth of the fortnight is the day of the quarter moon, both waxing and waning. The "four great kings" (catumaharajjāno) are the rulers of the lowest of the six sense-sphere heavenly worlds, the realm closest to the human. We find here a graded sequence: on the eighth, their ministers and assembly members (amaccā: pärisajjä) inspect the world; on the fourteenth (the day before the full moon and new moon), their sons (puttä) inspect the world; and on the fifteenth, the actual full-moon and new-moon days, the four great kings themselves inspect the world.

385 Mp : "When they observe the uposatha, they undertake the uposatha factors eight times per month. Keeping the extra observance days (patijagaranti), in a single fortnight they do so by anticipating and following up (paccuggamanänugamuna) the four uposatha days. Anticipating the uposatha of the fifth, they undertake the uposatha on the fourth; and following up, on the sixth. Anticipating the uposatha of the eighth, they observe it on the seventh; and following up; on the ninth. Anticipating the uposatha of the fourteenth, they observe it on the thirteenth, and following up the uposatha of the fifteenth, they observe the uposatha at the beginning [of the next fortnight]. They do meritorious deeds (puññani karonti) in various ways: by going for refuge, constantly observing the precepts, offering flowers, listening to the Dhamma, offering lights, making dwellings, etc. Having wandered around, [the ministers and assembly members] write down the names of the merit-makers on a golden sheet and present it to the four great kings." For canonical accounts of the uposatha observance, see 3:70 and 8:41, 8:42.

386 I follow Be as against Ce and Ee in the division between this sutta and the next. Ce and Ee take this sentence as the beginning of 3:38 (No. 37 in Ee's scheme) and the second narrative that begins bhütapubbam bhikkhave ("Bhikkhus, once in the past")-several paragraphs below-as a continuation of the sutta. Be, however,
takes the first narrative about Sakka to be a continuation of 3:37, and the second narrative to mark the beginning of 3:38. A Chinese parallel, SĀ 1117 (T II 295c10-296a23), agrees with Be on this but merges into one the two statements about Sakka and the liberated bhikkhu.

387 Pätihāriyapakkha. Mp says that they undertake a continuous uposatha observance for the full three months of the rains (antovasse temāsam); if they cannot manage this, they should observe it for a full month after the rains, between the two invitation days, or at least for a two-week period following the first invitation day. The "invitation" (pavärana) is the occasion, at the end of the rains, when bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs "invite" (paväreti) their fellows to point out any faults in their behavior during the rains. Spk I 307,9-16, commenting on pāthāriyapakkha at SN 10:5, I 208,27, explains the term in a broader sense (see CDB p. 480, note 573).

388 Be treats this sentence as the beginning of 3:38. Strangely, Be titles this "The Second on the Four Great Kings" even though the sutta makes no mention of them.

389 Mp defines paduma as a white lotus (pandarapadumam) and puṇdarika as a red lotus (rattapadumam). SED, however, defines puṇdarīka as "a lotus flower (esp. a white lotus)," adding that the word is used to mean "white" in general. Numerous websites I consulted also define puṇdarika as a white lotus.

390 Kāsi was one of the sixteen great states of India, with its capital at Bārāṇasī.

391 These are the three seasons of northern India: the winter lasts roughly from November to March, the hot season from March to July, and the rainy season from July to November. Mp says that the winter mansion had nine stories, which were low in order to retain heat; the summer mansion had five stories, which were high in order to allow the air to cool; and the rains mansion had seven stories, which were neither high nor low in order to establish a medium temperature.

392 Nippurisehi. Mp says that not only the musicians but all the posts in the palaces were occupied bywomen (itthiyo). Thus for four months another man did not get to see him.

393 Attānamyeva atisitva. Atisitvā is absolutive of atisarati. See DOP sv atisarati.

394 Ee takes this sentence to mark the beginning of a new sutta, 3:39 in its numbering. But Ce and Be , which I follow, treat this passage as a continuation of the sutta that began with the Buddha's recollection of his delicate upbringing. In Ce and Be , this entire sutta is $3: 39$, so that at this point the numbering in all three editions coincides.

395 The third pāda is obscure: yathā dhammā tathā santa. I translate it literally. In explaining the fourth pāda, Mp adds parapuggalam as an object of the verb jigucchanti.

396 Ce and Be read nekkhamme datthu khematam. Ee has nekkhammam datthu khemato as its primary reading but mentions the Ce and Be variants in its notes. Mp (both Ce and Be) uses the Ce and Be reading as the lemma, which it glosses nibbāne khemabhāvam disva, but it then cites the Ee reading as a variant, glossed nibbānam khemato disvā. Thus here Ee has chosen the variant as the primary reading.

397 Mp says that these verses refer to his own, energy as it arose while he was sitting beneath the bodhi tree.

398 In Pāli: attädhipateyyam lokädhipateyyam dhammädhipateyyam. Although Bucknell (2004) does not list a Chinese parallel of this sutta, by chance I recently discovered a parallel cited in the *Śāriputrābhidharmasastra, at T XXVIII 679c22-680a27. While the prose portion there is simpler than that of the Pāli, the two convey essentially the same meaning. Their verses, with the exception of the last, also closely correspond.

399 Na itibhaväbhavahetu. Mp takes the long vowel connecting the two occurrences of bhava to signify repetition, not negation: "Not for the sake of this or that prosperous future state of existence, [wishing]: '[Let me obtain] such an existence [or] such an existence'" (iti bhavo, iti bhavo ti evam āyatim na tassa tassa sampattibhavassa hetu).

400 Attā te purisa jānāti saccam vā yadi vā musā. Mp: "You yourself know, of whatever you do, whether it is of this or that nature. For this reason, it should be understood that, for one who does an evil deed; there is no place in the world that can be called 'hidden.'"

401 The Pāli is obscure here and Mp is not particularly helpful in resolving the difficulty. The Chinese parallel (at $680_{220-21}$, but following the Song, Yuan, Ming reading) has: 言無虛者勝，是則不自毀，若已有緩犯，知而不覆藏。This conveys a somewhat different point, which I would render: "One who says 'It is not false' is better, for then one does not damage oneself. If a transgression exists and one knows it, do not conceal it."

402 The Chinese (at $680_{226-27}$ ) is quite different: 遠離捨六情，減苦不受有，已沒不復邇，永離於生死。I would render: "Having discarded and abandoned the six sense faculties, he ends suffering and does not take [another] existence. Having passed away, he does not come back, being forever freed from birth and death."

403 Mp explains "experiences the meaning" (atthapatisamvedī) as "experiences with knowledge the explanation of the meaning
(or commentary)" (atṭhakatham ñānena patisamvedī) and "experiences the Dhamma" (dhammapatisamivedī) as "experiences the Dhamma of the canonical text" (pälidhammam patisamivedī). This obviously imposes a later distinction on older terms. However, while the two terms are often paired, the precise distinction between attha and dhamma is not clearly drawn in the Nikāyas. In fact, each term is ambivalent and thus their different nuances further complicate their relationship. Attha can signify meaning, benefit, good, and goal; dhamma can signify the teaching, the system of practice, the nature of things, and the truth pointed to by the teaching. Thus the contrast between dhamma and attha can be seen as that between the formulated teaching and its meaning, between the practice and its goal, and between the teaching and the benefit it brings.

404 Mp explains santānam brahmacärinam as referring to those who support their parents (idha pana mātāpitu-upatṭhākā adhippetā), but I see the expression as referring to monastics, either as the recipients of service (upatṭhānam) or of the giving (dānam) mentioned in pāda a. Mp further construes santānam as genitive plural of sant, "good, virtuous" (Mp: uttamatṭhena santānam), but it is more likely to be "peaceful," from Skt sānta. Santānam brahmacärinam is also at SN 1:10, I 5,4, where Spk I 28.2, glosses it with santakilesānam panditānam vā, "those with pacified defilements or wise ones." The Chinese parallel SĀ 995 (at T II 260c29) has 寂靜修梵行， which means that in this transmission santānam came down as Skt sāntānam.

405 Sañkhatassa sañkhatalakkhañāni. Lit. "three conditioned characteristics of the conditioned." And below asañkhatassa asañkhatalakkhanāni, lit. "three unconditioned characteristics of the unconditioned." I render these expressions in the way I have to avoid giving the wrong impression that the characteristics themselves are conditioned or unconditioned. The point, rather, is that they determine as such the conditioned and the unconditioned.

406 I follow Ee in making the statements on the characteristics of the conditioned and the unconditioned two parts of a single sutta. Ce and Be take them to be separate suttas and thus count eleven suttas in this vagga. The uddāna verse includes "sañkhataṃ" but not "asañkhataṃ," which seems to support Ee. At this point, my numbering agrees with Fe but falls behind Be by one (Ce does not number the suttas continuously but begins each vagga with ' 1 '). Interestingly, the Chinese parallel EĀ 22.5 (at TII 607c13-c23) mentions only the characteristics of the conditioned; there is no corresponding section on the characteristics of the unconditioned.

407 Reading with Ce gedham (PED sv gedha'), as against Be and Ee rodham (bank).

408 At SN 1:3, I 2, this verse is spoken by a deity, who is then "corrected" by the Buddha with a verse that bids the "seeker of peace" to "drop the world's bait" (lokämisam pajahe santipekkho).

409 This and the preceding verse are at SN 1:41, I 31.

410. Sanditthiko dhammo.

411 Kukkutasampātikā. Mp: "'Cocks' flying between them' (kukkutasampäto) is cocks' flying from the rooftops in one village to the rooftops in another. When they are so situated, it is said they are 'so close that cocks could fly between them.' There is also the reading kukkutasampädikā ('so close that cocks could walk between them'). 'Cocks' walking between them' (kukkutasampädo) is cocks' going on foot from one village to another. When they are so situated, it is said they are 'so close that cocks could walk between them.'"

412 Tanuttam paññayati. Lit., "the diminution [of human beings] is seen."

413 Gämäpi agämä honti, nigamäpi anigamä honti, nagaräpi anagarä honti, janapadäpi ajanapadä honti. Lit., "villages have become nonvillages, towns have become non-towns, cities have become noncities, and provinces have become non-provinces."

414 Mp : "Illicit lust (adhammaräga): Lust is exclusively contrary to the Dhamma (adhamma), but it is not 'illicit lust' when it arises in relation to one's own possessions. It is only 'illicit lust' when it arises in regard to the possessions of others. Unrighteous greed (visamalobha): Though greed is never actually righteous, greed arisen for an object that belongs to oneself is called righteous greed. The greed arisen for an object belonging to another is called unrighteous greed. Wrong Dhamma (micchädhamma):indulgence in what is not a base." Mp-t: "Indulgence in some base of lust (rāgassa vatthutthanam) other than that considered good by the world's standards."

415 I read with Be, Ee, and Mp (Ce and Be): yakkhā väle amanusse ossajjanti. Ce of AN has manusse for amanusse. Yakkhas are demonic spirits, sometimes depicted as killing human beings and devouring their flesh, but also capable of goodness and even realization of the Dhamma. Mp: "'Yakkhas' are the ruling yakkhas. They release fierce yakkhas on the paths of humans, and when these [yakkhas] get the chance, they deprive the people of their lives" (yakkhā ti yakkhädhipatino. Väle amanusse ossajjantī ti candayakkhe manussapathe vissajjenti, te laddhokäsā mahājanam jīvitakkhayam pāpenti). Though I follow Mp, I wonder if a more original reading of the text would construe the verb
as passive and put all the substantives in nominative plural: yakkha vaḷa amanussa ossajjanti. "Yakkhas-wild, nonhumanare released."

416 Kacci te bhoto gotamassa vuttavādino ca bhavantam gotamam abhütena abbhācikkhanti, dhammassa cānudhammam byākaronti, na ca koci sahadhammiko vādānupāto gārayham ṭhānam āgacchati. So all three editions, but some variants have vädänuvädo in place of vädānupāto. I have discussed the formula in detail in CDB, p. 747, note 72, but I now believe that the Pāli commentaries err in taking vädānupāta (or vädänuvada) to mean "consequence of their assertion." I now take this term to be simply a synonym of gärayham ṭhānam." In support of this change, see 5:5; where sahadhammikā vādānuvādā gārayhā ṭhānā āgacchanti and its opposite, sahadhammikā pāsamsā ṭhānā āgacchanti, occur without reference to any prior assertion.

Chinese parallels to the present sutta support this interpretation. SĀ 95 (at T II 26a11-14), reads: 云何？䋗䉤！作是語者，為實說耶？非為謗毀㗝曋乎？為如說說、如法說耶、法次法說，不為餘人以同法来訶者耶？("How is it? Gotama, does one who says this speak truthfully? Is it the case that he does not misrepresent Gotama? Does he speak in accordance with what was said, in accordance with the Dharma, in line with the Dharma, so that other people cannot criticize him in terms of that same Dharma?"). Another parallel at T II 493b19-21 is similar, with nothing that corresponds to "consequence of an assertion."

417 Mp says that the "holy ones" (sante) are the supreme persons (uttamapurise): Buddhas, pacekabuddhas, and arahants.

418 Sappaññe dhīrasammate. Mp glosses this as if it meant "esteemed, honored, by the learned" (panditehi sammate sambhāvite); but I take dhirasammate to mean "esteemed, honored, as sagely (or wise)."

419 The verse, which also occurs as Dhp 423 a-d, alludes to the three knowledges.

420 Mp : Yañña is "a thing to be given" (deyyadhamma; though this is already covered by the fourth item); saddha (Skt śrāddha), "a meal in memory of the dead" (matakabhattam); thālipāka, "a meal to be.given to excellent persons" (varapurisānam dātabbayuttam bhattam, but according to SED sv sthält, sthālipāka is more specifically a dish of barley or rice boiled in milk offered as an oblation); and deyyadhamma, "anything else that can be given."

421 Anuttaram brahmacariyogadham. Mp: "Nibbāna is 'the unsurpassed culmination of the spiritual life,' the supreme support for the spiritual life, which is the path to arahantship" (arahattamaggasañkhātassa brahmacariyassa anuttaram ogadham uttamapatitṭhābhūtam nibbānam). In MN 44.29, I 304,21-22,
nibbānogadham is used in conjunction with nibbānaparāyanam and nibbānapariyosānam, which suggests that the three terms are synonymous. It-a I 112,11-12, glosses nibbānogadhagāmī (the same phrase as in AN) with nibbänasañkhātaṃ ogadham patiṭtham pāram gacchati ("it goes to the far shore, the support, the culmination consisting in nibbāna"). This explanation, which is consistent with other commentaries, supports my rendering of nibbānogadha here as "culmination in nibbāna" rather than "the plunge into nibbāna," a rendering used by other translators. My rendering of amatogadha in CDB (as at SN 45:139, 46:184, 48:42, 48:44, etc.) as "with the deathless as its ground" is not satisfactory. I am grateful to Vanarata for his comments on this term.

422 Mp : "He did not want to answer Ānanda's question, so he tried to turn the discussion aside with words of praise."

423 Iddhipātihāriyaṃ ādesanāpātihāriyaṃ anusāsanīpātihāriyaṃ. Also at DN 11.3-8, I 212-14.

424 Nimittena ādisati. Mp explains it as if it means an unrelated clue in the environment, but it may be a gesture or facial expression-what we now call "body language"-that reveals to a skilled observer the other person's state of mind.

425 Vitakkavipphārasaddam sutvā. Mp: "Having heard the sound of those muttering while asleep or oblivious, which [sound] arises by the diffusion of thought." I suspect that Mp misses the point. Since the examples in the sutta proceed from the coarser to the subtler, this one should be subtler than its predecessor. I think that what is intended is a subtle sound supposedly emanated by thought but not expressed verbally.

426 This must be referring to one in the second or higher jhānas.

427 Mp gives examples: "Think thoughts of desirelessness, not thoughts of sensuality, etc. Attend to the idea of impermanence, etc., not to permanence, etc. Abandon lust for sensual pleasure and enter a world-transcending path and fruit."

428 Āsajja upanīya vācā bhāsitā. Āsajja usually means "having attacked," but this meaning seems too strong here. Mp merely paraphrases without giving much help: "The words you spoke hit upon my virtues and intrude on the domain of my virtues" (mama guṇe ghaṭtetvā mam'eva guṇānaṃ santikaṃ upānītā vācā bhāsitā). I therefore assume that the words, without being insulting, are considered inappropriate because they are making a personal inquiry.

429 "Sectarian tenets" renders titthāyatanāni, lit. "bases of sects." The word tittha (Skt tīrtha), which originally meant a ford in a river, was used to designate religious teachings, probably in the sense that these teachings provide a "ford" for crossing the stream of defilements and reaching the far shore of liberation (see MN 34,
where this metaphor governs a short discourse). Mp explains that the sects (tittha) are the sixty-two views (see DN 1.1.29-3.29, I 12-39); the founders of the sects (titthakara) are those who formulate those views; and the followers of the sects (titthiya) are those who approve of the views. The great teachers in Jainism are called in Skt tirthankara.

430 Parampi gantvā akiriyāya sanṭhahanti. Mp glosses parạ̣ with paramparā, "lineage": "Even if they have gone to one of the three kinds of lineage, the lineage of teachers, the lineage of beliefs, and the lineage of [one's] individual existences" (ācariyaparamparā ladduhparamparā attabhāvaparamparā ti etesu yamkiñci paramparam gantvā pi). It is hard to see how this has any relevance to the context. Since parạ̣ can also mean "later, further, afterward," it seems the point being conveyed is that these positions, if extended further, eventuate in non-doing. On the basis of this understanding, I render parampigantvā as "taken to their conclusion." Sanṭhahanti is, more literally, "stop at."

431 These are respectively the doctrines of the Jains, the theists, and non-causality, a doctrine elsewhere ascribed to Makkhali Gosāla (see 1:319, 3:137).

432 Mp : "They hold that one experiences feelings exclusively because of kamma created in the past." In this connection, see SN 36:21, IV 230-31, where the Buddha explains eight causes for illness or affliction, only one of which is the ripening of past kamma. Brahmāli writes: "The point here seems to be that each of these unwholesome ways of acting is related to particular feelings, and that those feelings (or experiences) can only be experienced through those acts. It follows that if your kamma is such that you have to experience the feelings connected with those bad acts, then you will have to perform them." The same point, with suitable changes, applies to the following two tenets, that of God's creative activity and non-causality. In each case, agents escape responsibility for their actions.

433 At MN 14.15-19, I 92-93, and MN 101, II 214-28, the Buddha challenges the Niganthas with other arguments against their thesis that all feeling is due to past kamma.

434 Mp : "He has so far shown that these sectarian tenets, when taken to their conclusion, eventuate in non-doing, and are therefore empty and unemancipating, without substance. He now shows that the Dhamma he teaches is substantial and emancipating (sārabhāvañc'eva niyyānikabhāvañca)."

435 For a detailed analysis of the six elements, see MN 140.14-19, III $240-43$.

436 Mp explains manopavicara thus: "The mind's examination of
the eighteen cases, using the 'feet' of thought and examination (vitakkavicārapādehi)." The word "feet" (pāda) is used here because vicara originally meant "traveling around."

437 Mp : "Why does he begin in this way? For ease of understanding. For the Tathāgata wants to explain the revolving of the twelve conditions, so he shows the round by the term 'descent of a [future] embryo' (gabbhassāvakkanti). For when the round has been shown by the descent of a [future] embryo, what follows will be easy to understand. Whose six elements serve as the condition, the mother's or the father's? It is neither, but descent of a [future] embryo occurs conditioned by the six elements of the being taking rebirth." Mp cites MN 38.26, I 265,35-66,6 (see tóo MN 93.18, II 156,30-57,3).

438 This may be a unique instance where the noble truths of the origin and cessation of suffering are explicated by way of the full twelve factors of dependent origination. At SN 12:43, II 72-73, the origination (samudaya) of suffering is explained by way of the links from consciousness through craving; its passing away (atthangama), by way of the cessation of the links from craving through old age and death. In the Chinese parallel, MĀ 13 (at T I 435a24-436a10), the second and third truths are not explained by way of dependent origination but according to the stock formulations as found in SN 56:11, V 421, and elsewhere.

439 Tin'imāni bhikkhave amātāputtikāni bhayāni ti assutavā puthujjano bhāsati. Lit. "There are these three [things] that the uninstructed worldling speaks of as 'without-mother-and-son perils."

440 Tīni samātāputtikāniyeva bhayāni amātāputtikāni bhayānī ti assutavā puthujjario bhāsati. Literally: "There are three with-mother-andson perils that the uninstructed worldling speaks of as 'without-mother-and-son perils." The perils are obviously the great fire, the flood, and the turbulence. Since these initially separate mother and son, one can call them "perils that separate mother and son." But since, in the end, mother and son find one another, one can also call them perils when mother and son reconnect.

441 Mp : "Having shown in a provisional way (pariyayato) the perils that separate mother and son, he now shows in a non-provisional way (nippariyāyena) the perils that separate mother and son."

442 In translating the names of these different types of beds and their appurtenances I have relied on Horner's translation of Vin I 192,14-19 (1951, 4:256-57). She based her renderings on Sp V 1086,1-1087,12, which corresponds to Mp II 292-93.

443 Dibbam uccāsayanamahāsayanaṃ, brahman uccāsayanamahāsayanaṃ, ariyaṃ uccāsayanamahāsayanaṃ.

444 So ce aham, brāhmaṇa, evambhüto cañkemämi, dibbo me eso tasmiṃ
samaye cankamo hoti. Mp says that his walking back and forth is celestial when, having entered the four jhānas, he walks back and forth; and his walking back and forth is celestial when, after emerging from the four jhānas, he walks back and forth. This seems to imply that walking can occur even with the mind in jhāna. This, however, is contradicted by the dominant understanding that jhana is a state of uninterrupted absorption in an object, in which case intentional movements like walking would not be possible. Mp-t explains the first case of Mp (walking after entering the jhānas) to mean that he walks back and forth immediately after emerging from the jhāna, while the second case (walking after emerging) to mean that he walks back and forth after having emerged some time earlier. The same explanation holds for the divine and the noble beds.

445 Mp : "This shows the lust abandoned by the path of arahantship at the site of the great enlightenment. By means of reviewing he refers to the attainment of fruition."

446 Mp explains that he had been commissioned by the wanderers in his own community to take ordination with the bhikkhus, learn the secret of their success (which they believed to be a kind of magic they used to attract followers), and then return and share it with them. After his ordination he concluded that the Pātimokkha was the key to their success. Having learned the Pātimokkha, he returned to the wanderers and reported that he had learned the Dhamma of the Buddha's followers. The background story is similar to that of the Susima Sutta (SN 12:70, II 119-28) but has a different outcome.

447 Ee has an additional line here: mayā kho Sarabha paññayati sāmananaṃ Sakyaputtiyanaṃ dhammo: "Sarabha, the Dhamma of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan son has been seen by me." Be has a variant on this line in parentheses but Ce does not have anything corresponding to it.

448 At MN 35.13-14, I231,27-28, 32-35, it is said: "If anyone, when asked a reasonable question up to the third time by the Tathāgata, still does not answer, his head splits into seven pieces then and there." Here, however, Sarabha fails to answer the Buddha's question after it has been posed three times, yet his head remains intact and no threat is raised against him.

449 This is the first of the Buddha's four kinds of self-confidence (vesārajja), on which see 4:8. The second claim, just below, refers to the second kind of self-confidence, and the third claim to the fourth kind of self-confidence. The third kind of self-confidence is not included here.

450 From the Pāli, it is unclear what the three alternatives are in this
statement. In Ce the disjunctive $v \bar{a}$ occurs only twice in this sentence, suggesting only two alternatives. Ee has three occurrences of va, but tunhibhūto va mañkubhūto va divides two terms that normally belong to a single alternative. Be has only one $v \bar{a}$, which leaves the question of the alternatives even more obscure. I have chosen to separate "he would answer evasively ..." and "display anger, hatred, and bitterness," even though we often find the sequence without a disjunction: aññenaññam pațicarati, bahiddhā katham apanāmeti, kopañca dosañca appaccayañca pātukaroti. In this respect, I have followed the divisions of the Chinese parallel, SA 970, which at TII 250b21-23 does offer three distinct alternatives: 被則遑落說諸外事。或忿恚慢覆。對関不忍。無由能現。或默然抱愧低頭。密自思省: "He would divert the discussion to an outside subject, or (或), overcome by anger and conceit, would unreasonably display hostility and impatience, or (或) would silently harbor shame, his head lowered, privately reflecting."

451 Yassà kho pana te atthāya dhammo desito so na niyyāti takkarassa sammā dükkhakkhayāya ti. Mp. takes yassa atthāya to mean "the purpose for which" the Dhamma is taught, identified as the destruction of lust, etc., and "the Dhamma" to be meditation on unattractiveness, etc. The verb niyyāti means "goes out" (to the complete destruction of suffering). Takkarassa is likely to be a sandhi formation: takkaro assa.

I have been able to track down two Chinese versions of the phrase (there may be more): (1) EĀ 27.6 (T II 645c10-11) reads 諸賢聖出要之法。盡於苦際。欲使不出要者。終無此處 ("It is impossible that this outward-going Dharma of the noble ones does not go out to the complete end of suffering"). (2) EĀ 46.4 (T II 776 c2s777a2) has 我所說法。賢聖得出要者。如實盡於苦際。設有沙門・婆羅門・天・若魔天來欲言未盡苦際者。無此處 ("By this Dharma taught by me the noble ones go out correctly to the complete end of suffering. It is impossible that any ascetic (etc.) could come and say: '[They] have not reached the complete end of suffering'").

452 Here the Chinese of SA 970, at T II 250b2s, has simply "he got up from his seat and left" (從坐起而去) without a supernormal departure.

453 Vācāya sattitodakena sañjambharim akaṃsu. Be and Ee have sannitodakena for Ce sattitodakena. The Chinese counterpart at TII 250cs says simply: "they reproached him and censured him to his face" (面前呵責毀告).

454 Seyyathāpi,āvuso sarabha, ambakamaddari 'phussakaravitan ravissāmi' ti ambakamaddariravitamyeva ravati. Be has ambukasañcārī for Ce and Ee ambakamaddari and purisaka for phussaka. I have taken some liberty in rendering the obscure names of these birds in
order to bring out the sense. $\mathrm{Mp}(\mathrm{Ce})$ glosses ambakamaddari as a small chicken (khuddakakukkuṭikā) and phussaka as a large chicken (mahākukkuta). The Chinese parallel, at T II 250c3, has: "Just as a woman might try to make the sound of a man but only makes the sound of a woman" (譬如女人欲作丈夫愛，發軾即作女愛). Pāli purisakaravitam might be understood as the crying out of a man, and ambaka as a woman, but in the absence of a clear and simple contrast between ambaka and purisa in the same edition, I follow Mp's gloss.

455 Be Kesamiutti. This discourse is best known under the name "The Kālāma Sutta." A Chinese parallel is MĀ 16 (at T1 438b13-439c22). I will note below some of the important ways it-differs from the Pāli version.

456 From the last sentence of the preceding paragraph through this sentence, MĀ 16 reads instead: "Gotama, having heard this, we gave rise to doubt and uncertainty: 'Of these ascetics or brahmins, which [speak] truthfully and which [speak] falsely?'" The Blessed One said: "Kālāmas, do not give rise to doubt and uncertainty. For what reason? Because when there is doubt and uncertainty, there will arise perplexity. Kālāmas, you yourselves do not have pure wisdom with which to know whether there is an afterlife or not. You yourselves do not have pure wisdom about what deeds are transgressions and what deeds are not transgressions."

457 These ten inadequate sources of knowledge may be divided into three categories: (1) The first, comprising the first four criteria, are propositions based on tradition. These include "oral tradition" (anussava), generally understood to refer to the Vedic tradition; "lineage" (paramparā), an unbroken succession of teachings or teachers; "hearsay" (or "report"; itikirā), popular opinion or general consensus; and "a collection of scriptures" (pitakasampadā), a collection of texts regarded as infallible. In the Buddha's day these would have been orally transmitted rather than written. (2) The second set comprises the next four terms referring to four types of reasoning; their differences need not detain us here, but since the Buddha himself often uses reasoning, they must all involve reasoning from hypothetical premises rather than from empirical observation. (3) The third set, consisting of the last two items, contains two types of personal authority: the first, "seeming competence" (bhabbarūpatā), is the personal charisma of the speaker (perhaps including his external qualifications); the second is the authority of the speaker as one's guru (Pāli garu being identical with Skt guru).

MĀ 16 does not have this passage on the ten inadequate sources of knowledge. Instead, the Buddha immediately explains
to the Kālāmas the three unwholesome roots of action and how they lead to moral transgressions. And then he explains the ten courses of wholesome kamma, the explanations being very similar to those found, e.g., at 10:176 (on the threefold purity) and 10:211 (on rebirth in heaven). In MĀ 16, the Buddha does not ask the Kālāmas to judge for themselves but categorically tells them what he himself has known by direct experience. It is possible that MĀ 16 is a normalization of an original Indic text corresponding to the Pāli version, made at a time when the Buddha was widely regarded as an unquestionable authority.

458 According to the Buddha, greed, hatred, and delusion are the three unwholesome roots (akusalamülāni), which underlie all immoral conduct and all defiled states of mind; see 3:69. Since the goal of his own teaching, nibbāna, is the destruction of greed, hatred, and delusion (SN 38:1, IV 251,16-20), the Buddha subtly leads the Kālāmas to affirm his teaching simply by reflecting on their own experience, without any need for him to impose his authority on them.

459 This is certainly counterintuitive, at least on the basis of what is immediately visible, for cases of "bad things happening to good people" are innumerable.

460 Idhahan uibhayen'eva visuddham attānam samanupassami. The exact meaning of "in both respects" is not entirely clear to me. Mp glosses: "Since I do no evil, and it is not done [to me as it is] to one who does [evil]" (yañca pāpạ̣ na karomi, yañca karotopi na karīyati)." However, it seems to me more likely that the two kinds of purification are (1) not doing any evil deeds, and (2) developing a pure mind by practice of the four immeasurable states (loving-kindness, etc.). This seems to be the purport of the Chinese parallel (see next note).

461 The four assurances of MĀ 16 (at T I 439bs-26) are as follows: (1) "If there is this world and the other world, if there are results of good and bad deeds, I acquire the kamma connected with this right view; I uphold it and possess it. With the breakup of the body, after death, I will certainly go to a good state, even to rebirth in the heavenly realm. (2) If this world and the other world do not exist, and there are no results of good and bad deeds, still, even in this present life, I cannot be blamed by others on account of [my conduct], but I will be praised by the wise. However, those of right effort and right view say that there is [this world, the other world, and results of karma]. (3) If anything is done, certainly I do no evil, I think nothing evil. Since I do no evil, how can suffering arise for me? (4) If anything is done, certainly I do no evil. I do not transgress against what is fearful and not fearful in the world. I always have love and compassion for
the whole world. My mind has no belligerence toward sentient beings; it is without stains, joyful and happy."

462 Atthi idam, atthi hīnam, atthi panitam, atthi imassa saññagatassa uttari nissaranam. This is also at MN 7.17, I 38,31-32, where it also follows the four divine abodes. Mp says "there is this" refers to the five aggregates, the truth of suffering; "the inferior" to the truth of the origin; "the superior" to the truth of the path; and "a further escape from whatever is involved with perception" to nibbāna, the truth of cessation.

463. Brahmabhūtena attanā viharati. The whole phrase is also at 4:198, II 206,2-4, and MN 51.5, I 341,11-13. It seems to be a deliberate attempt by the Buddha to co-opt Upanishad terminology for the purposes of his own teaching.

464 These are the four methods of formulating questions; see 4:42. Mp: "(1) A question that should be answered categorically (ekamsavyäkananiya pañha) is, for example, 'Is the eye impermanent?' which should be answered categorically with 'Yes, it is impermanent.' (2) A question that should be answered after making a distinction (vibhajjavyäkaranīya pañha) is, for example, 'Is the impermanent the eye?' which should be answered by making a distinction: 'Not only the eye, but the ear, nose, etc., are also impermanent.' (3) A question that should be answered with a counter-question (paṭipucchāvyākaranīya pañha) is, for example, 'Does the eye have the same nature as the ear?' One should answer this by asking, 'With respect to what?' If they reply, 'With respect to seeing,' one should answer no. If they reply, 'With respect to impermanence,' one should answer yes. (4) A question that should be set aside (thapaniya pañha) is, for example, 'Is the soul the same as the body?' This should be set aside without answering it, saying, 'This has not been declared by the Tathāgata.'" In my opinion, better examples of "a question that should be answered after making a distinction" are the Buddha's response to Subha at MN 99.4, II 197,9-18; his response to the brahmin Ujjaya at 4:39, II 42,14-28; and the householder Vajjiyamāhita's response to the wanderers at 10:94, V 190,14-20.

465 The meaning of these expressions is tar from self-evident. I have therefore relied on Mp, which I translate in full, omitting only a few minor explanations meaningful only in Pāli:

"One does not stand firm in regard to his position and the opposing position (thānāthāne na santhāti): One does not stand firm in regard to what is a reason and what is not a reason. This is the method here: An eternalist is able to refute an annihilationist with a fitting reason. Being refuted by him, the annihilationist thinks, 'Why should I now continue to assert annihilation?' He
then proclaims eternalism; he is unable to remain fixed in his own doctrine. So too, when an annihilationist is able [to refute] the eternalist [and the latter does not stand firm]; and similarly, when an advocate of personalism is able [to refute the emptiness doctrine], and when an advocate of emptiness is able [to refute personalism]. Such is what is meant by saying that he does not stand firm in regard to his position and the opposing position." (Could this mean, rather, that he does not stand firm in regard to what is actually the case and what is not the case, or in regard to what is possible and what is not possible? These are also meanings, respectively, of thāna and atthāna.)

"He does not stand firm in his stratagem (parikappe na santhāti): This is found both in asking the question and in answering it. How? For someone clears his throat, thinking: 'I will ask a question.' The other tells him: 'You will ask this.' Having realized he has been found out, he says: 'T won't ask that, but something else.' The one who is asked a question, too, strokes his chin, thinking: 'I will answer the question.' The other tells him: 'You will answer this.' Having realized he has been found out, he says: 'I won't answer in that way, but in this way.' Such is what is meant by saying that he does not stand firm in his stratagem.

"He does not stand firm in an assertion about what is known (aññatavāde na santhāti): Someone asks a question. The other says: 'The question you asked is agreeable. Where did you learn this?' The other, though he has asked a question in a fitting way, gives rise to doubt because of [his opponent's] statement, thinking: 'Did I ask [about a matter] that isn't problematic?' The one who has been asked the question answers. The other says to him: 'You have answered the question well. Where did you learn this? [You answered] the question as it should be answered.' The other [the respondent], though he has answered in a fitting way, gives rise to doubt because of [his opponent's] statement, thinking: 'Did I answer [about a matter] that isn't problematic?'

"He does not stand firm in the procedure (pattipadāya na santhāti): Not having understood the rule (vattam ajānitva), he asks under circumstances when a question should not be asked. If a question is asked in the courtyard of a memorial shrine (cetiyangana), one should not answer it. So too, [one should not answer] on the way to the alms round; when walking for alms in the village; when sitting in the meeting hall; when sitting and taking porridge or a meal; when sitting after the meal; and when going to the place where one passes the day. However, when one is sitting in one's day quarters, if someone asks permission and then poses
a question, it should be answered; but one should not answer if they do not ask permission. Such is what is meant by: 'Asking a question without having understood the rule, he does not stand firm in the procedure.'"

466 That is, he seizes upon a slight mistake on the other's part as a pretext for criticizing him.

467 Mp: "He directly knows one thing, a wholesome Dhamma, the noble path. He fully understands one thing, the truth of suffering. He abandons one thing, all unwholesome qualities. He realizes one thing, the fruit of arahantship or [the truth of] cessation. By means of knowledge he reaches right liberation, emancipation by the fruit of arahantship."

468 Anariyagunam āsajja. The line is problematic. As printed, it would be translated: "Having attacked ignoble qualities." But guna usually means virtuous qualities. Mp gives an unconvincing explanation: "They give a talk using ignoble qualities to attack qualities." I translate on the supposition that the correct reading of the line should be anariya gunam āsajja, "the ignoble ones assail [good] qualities," A Chinese parallel, MA 119 at T I 609as-b29, closely matches the Pāli in regard to the verses, and the corresponding line ( 609 bis) accords with my interpretation: 非聖毀皆德 ("ignoble, they criticize [each others'] virtues").

469 Dhammatṭhapatisamyuttā yā ariyācaritā kathā. Mp explains dhammatṭhapatisamyuttā thus: "The talk is made by one established in the Dhamma, thus it is established in the Dhamma; and [the talk] is connected with the Dhamma, so it is established in and connected with the Dhamma." Mp thus takes dhammattha to be a compound of dhamme thita. I translate, however, on the assumption that dhammatṭhapatisamyuttā contains a dvanda compound that should be resolved dhammena ca atthena ca patisamyuttā. In explanations of right speech, it is often said that the virtuous person is atthavädi dhamma $v \bar{a} d \bar{\imath}$, "one who speaks what is beneficial (or 'meaningful'), one who speaks on the Dhamma"; see 3:69, I 204,4; 10:176 §7, V 267,22. It is unusual-but not exceptionalto find attha in place of attha with the sense of "meaning" or "benefit"; it would be more unusual to find the termination tha embedded inside a compound and followed by a past participle. The Chinese parallel, which I discovered only after I had made my translation, supports my understanding here. At T I 609bis we read: 有法亦有義諸聖論如是，"talk that has Dhamma and that has meaning: all the talk of the noble ones is like this." The character 義, like Pāli attha, means both "good" and "meaning," and有義 can mean either "beneficial" or "meaningful."

470 I read here with Be anunnatena manasa. as a opinst Ce and Fe
anupädinnena manasā. Mp (both Ce and Be) glosses with anuddhatena cetasa, which supports anunnatena manasa.

471 Mp illustrates how lust is "less blameworthy" with the example of marriage, which, though rooted in sexual desire, is socially accepted and thus less blameworthy in regard to its kammic consequences. But since lust is connected with pleasure, it is hard to remove. Hatred and delusion are both regarded as blamable in society and have serious kammic consequences. Hatred, however, is connected with displeasure, and since beings naturally desire happiness they want to be rid of it: Delusive ideas, if deeply rooted in craving, wrong views, or conceit, will be as hard to remove as lust.

472 Asatā dukkham upadahati. Mp (Ce): "He creates suffering by falsehood, by what is non-existent, having spoken about an unreal fault" (abhütena avijjamānena yaṃ kiñci tassa abhütam dosaṃ vätva dukkham uppädeti). Note that Mp takes asatā to be synonymous with abhütena. In both text and Mp, Be reads uppādayati whereas Ce and Ee have upadahati.

473 Here and below the text mentions three kinds of trees: the sāla, the dhava, and the phandana.

474 The Niganthas are the Jain ascetics, followers of Mahāvira, the best known teacher of Jainism, known in the Nikāyas as the Niganṭha Nātaputta (Nāthaputta, Nātaputta). He was a contemporary of the Buddha and is included among the six rival teachers (see DN 2.16-33, I 52-59). It will be noted how, whenever the Nikāyas discuss the Jains, their tone becomes derisive if not acerbic. The compliments, of course, were returned by the Jains. This can be readily understood from the fact that the Buddhists and Jains originally flourished in the same territories and, as mendicant orders, they must have been in competition for supporters from the same communities.

475 Ye puratthimāya disāya pānā paraṃ yojanasataṃ tesu daṇdaṃ nikkhipāhi. Mp glosses: "Lay down the rod and be nonviolent toward those living beings dwelling in regions farther than a hundred yojanas" (tesu yojanasatato parabhāgesu thitesu sattesu dandam nikkhipa, nikkhittadando hohi). A yojana is between seven and nine miles. Thus the Jains are depicted as saying, "It's only toward beings living far away from you that you should be nonviolent," as if they were permitted to be violent against those living close by. This, it seems, is contrary to the Jain teaching, which enjoins strict nonviolence (ahimsa) in regard to all beings under all conditions. See http://www.jainworld.com/philosophy/ahimsa.asp.

476 Nāhaṃ kvacana, kassaci kiñcanatasmiṃ, na ca mama kvacana, katthaci kiñcanatatthi. Ce, Be, and Ee differ slightly among themselves in
their reading of this formula. I follow Ce here and later at 4:185. The purpose of the formula, according to this text, is to instill an attitude of non-possessiveness, one of the basic Jain virtues. The Buddha also taught this formula-which may have been in circulation among various contemplative communities-using it as a means to eliminate "I-making" and "mine-making." For further discussion of the formula, see p. 1713, note 896.

477 Upakkiliṭthassa visākhe cittassa upakkamena pariyodapanā hoti. Mp: "Why does he say this? Because the uposatha is not very fruitful if one observes it with a defiled mind, but becomes very fruitful if it is observed with a purified mind. He thus makes this statement to introduce the meditation subjects to be used for purifying the mind." What follows here are five of the standard six recollections (cha anussatiyo; see 6:10, etc.). For some reason, the sixth recollection, of generosity (cagannussati), is omitted. The omission would seem, at first blush, to result from a fault in transmission. However, the Chinese parallel, MĀ 202 (at T I 770a16-773a1), also lacks this recollection, which suggests that the omission-whether accidental or deliberate-preceded the split between the Vibhajjavādins (the ancestors of the Theravāda) and the Sarvāstivādins. Interestingly, in MĀ 202 the eight precepts precede the five recollections, while the Pali has the sets in reverse. The sequence of the Chinese version is more consistent with other Buddhist teachings, which treat virtuous conduct as the basis for meditation.

478 Mp : "It is the perfectly enlightened Buddha who is called Brahmā" (brahmā vuccati sammā sambuddho).

479 These are the six sense-sphere heavenly realms. The devas higher than these belong to the form and formless realms.

480 At this point, the Buddha explains the eight precepts undertaken by lay followers on the uposatha days. These appear again in AN at 8:41-45. They correspond closely to the ten precepts of the novice monk, with the seventh and eighth joined and the tenth (abstaining from acceptance of gold and silver, that is, money) omitted.

481 Ekabhattika. This might also have been rendered "eat in one part of the day." Mp: "There are two meal [periods], the morning meal [period] and the evening meal [period]. The morning meal [period] ends at midday; the evening meal [period] extends from midday until the following daybreak. Therefore even those who eat ten times before noon are said to eat once a day."

482 Ce pahütasattaratanānaṃ; Be pahütarattaratanānaṃ; Ee pahütamahāsattaratanānaṃ. Mp (Ce and Be) reads pahütarattaratanānaṃ, but Mp (Ee) has -satta- here. Mp explains: "Possessed of abundant
precious substances consisting in ratta; the meaning is that it is filled with the seven precious substances so that, if the surface of Jambudīpa (the Indian subcontinent) were the size of the surface of a bheri drum, the amount of seven substances would be the size of one's waist." There is thus an ambiguity about whether the original reading had -satta-or -ratta-. Mp-t states that the word ratta is a synonym for precious substance (ratta-saddo ratanapariyāyo), but also says that the reading pahūtasattaratanannam is found in the text. I translate on the basis of the latter reading.

483 Most of these states are located in the Indian subcontinent, but Gandhāra and Kamboja were in the northwest, corresponding to parts of modern Pakistan and Afghanistan.

484 Here begins a cosmological overview of the six sense-sphere heavens.

485 Reading with Be and Ee nabhe pabhāsanti; as against Ce nabhe pabhāsenti, "lighting up the skies."

486 Following Mp, I understand bhadäakam here to be merely a qualification of veluriyam, not a separate type of precious stone.

487 Mp: "Horn gold (singisuvanna) is gold similar [in color] to a cow's horn (gosingāsadisa). Mountain gold (kañcana) is gold found on a mountain. Natural gold (jātarūpa) is gold the color of the Buddha. Hataka is gold removed by ants."

488 Candappabhā, Mp: "A nominative used in a genitive sense, meaning 'to the moon's radiance' (candappabhāya)."

489 I take this sentence to be interrogative in sense though it contains no interrogative particle.

490 The school of Makkhali Gosāla, which taught strict determinism and emphasized extreme austerities.

491 Here and below the plural sugata is used. Thus in this context the word has a wider range than merely the Buddha, its usual application.

492 Attho ca vutto, attā ca anupanito. There is a word play here between attho, "meaning," and attā, "self."

493 Ee is missing the question here.

494 Mp : "Having explained the virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom of the trainee (sekha), he explains the virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom of one beyond training (asekha) by way of the fruit of arahantship: 'The fruition knowledge of one beyond training arises later than the concentration and insight knowledge of a trainee. The concentration of the fruit in one beyond training arises later than the trainee's insight knowledge."

495 The Licchavis were the dominant clan in the Vajji republic, which had its capital at Vesālī.

496 For a satire of Nātaputta's claim to omniscience, see MN 76.2122, II 519,13-33.

497 So purānānaṃ kammānaṃ tapasā byantiāhāvaṃ paññāpeti navānaṃ kammānaṃ akaraṇā setughātam. Mp: "He declares the destruction by austere practice of accumulated kammas (āyāhitakammānam) and the present non-accumulation of any kammas that might have been accumulated. The demolition of the bridge (setughātam) is the demolition of the factor and the demolition of the condition (padaghātam paccayaghātam)." Presumably what is meant is the destruction of kammic accumulations and their condition. SED gives "bond, fetter" as meanings of setu, which seems to fit here.

498 Evam etissā sandițthikāya nijjarāya visuddhiyā samatikkamo hóti. The "wearing away" (nijjarā) of old kamina through austerities is a fundamental Jain concept.

499 So navañca kammam na karoti, purānañca kammam phussa phussa vyantikaroti. Mp. "He does not accumulate new kamma. 'Old kamma' is the kamma accumulated in the past. Having contacted it again and again, he makes it vanish. This means that having contacted the resultant-contact again and again, he destroys that kamma."

500 Mp identifies the three stages of wearing away with the four noble attainments. The description of the bhikkhu in the first "wearing away" as virtuous, according to Mp, indicates the lower two paths and fruits-those of stream-entry and the once-returner-for disciples at these stages are said to have fulfilled virtuous behavior. The description of the bhikkhu in the second "wearing away," as one who attains the four jhānas, indicates the attainment of the third path and fruit, that of the non-returner, described as one who has fulfilled concentration. And the description of the bhikkhu in the third "wearing away" as one who has reached the destruction of the taints indicates the fruit of arahantship, since the arahant has fulfilled wisdom. Mp mentions another interpretation, which holds that all three kinds of "wearing away" are descriptions of arahantship, made from the standpoint of the arahant's virtue, concentration, and wisdom. For the correlation between the three trainings and the four noble attainments, see 3:86.

501 Abbhanumodasi. Lit. "to rejoice along with."

502 Aveccappasäda. Mp: "Unshakable confidence that arises by having experienced, by having known, their virtues." The expression signifies the confidence possessed by a noble person, one who has reached the minimal level of stream-entry.

503 Bhava. What is meant is a concrete state of individual existence in one of the three realms. Nibbāna is called bhavanirodha, the cessation of individual existence.

504 Ayatim punabbhaväbhinibbatti hoti. Mp says that the consciousness that serves as the seed (brija) is the kammically active consciousness (abhisamikhāraviñnānam) co-arisen with the kamma. In calling craving moisture (sneha) a word play is involved. Sneha, in Pali, can mean both moisture and affection; in the latter sense, sneha is sometimes used as a synonym for craving. The rebirth process is described in similar terms at SN 5:9, SN 12:64, SN 22:53, SN 22:54. The "inferior realm" (hin $\bar{a}$ dhātu) is the sensory realm. Similarly, just below, the "middling realm" (majjhima dhātu) is the form realm, and the "superior realm" (panīta dhātu) is the formless realm. The Buddha's path aims at overcoming rebirth in all realms.

505 Cetana patitthitā patthana patiṭthitā. Mp: "The kammic volition and kammic aspiration."

506 Silabbataṃ jivitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ upatṭhānasāraṃ. From the sequence, it is unclear whether upatṭhānasāra is one term parallel to the others or a distributive applying to each of the predecessors. Mp glosses as if the latter is the case, that is, as if it meant the setting up of the former three practices, taking them to be the core or essence of spiritual life: Upatṭhānena sāraṃ 'idaṃ varam idam nitthā' ti evam upatthitan ("Setting them up as the essence, having set them up [with the conviction] that they are excellent, the goal"). The same sequence of terms is at Ud 6:8, 71,29-32. Ud-a 351,9-17, allows both interpretations: either as a distributive or as one additional type of ascetic practice, perhaps the "carrying out" of certain ascetic practices. Collectively, the three (or four) terms represent the extreme of self-mortification; specific practices are described below at 3:156 $\$ 2$ where they are called "the blistering way of practice." The opposite extreme is the view that there is no harm in sensual pleasures, which corresponds to the sensualist practice described at 3:156 $\mathbf{8 1}$. The Buddha's "middle way," at 3:156 $\mathbf{3}$, avoids the two extremes.

507 Ce and Re read devatapi'ssa amanussa. Be does not have amanussa, "the spirits."

508 A shrub from which a fragrant powder is produced.

509 The verse is also at Dhp 54.

510 See SN 6:14, I 155-57. "Conveyed his voice" renders sarena viññapesi, more literally "communicated with his voice."

511 Sāvako so Ananda appareyyā tathāgatā. Mp: "The Buddha said this to indicate: 'Ānanda, why do you say this? He was a disciple established in partial knowledge. But the Tathāgatas, having fulfilled the ten perfections and attained omniscience, are immeasurable. The domain, range, and power of a disciple is one thing, the range of the Buddhas is quite different. It is like comparing a bit of soil in your fingernail with the soil of the great earth.'"

512 Cūlanikā lokadhātu. Mp: "This is the domain of a disciple" (ayam sāvakassa visayo).

513 These are the four continents, located respectively to the south, west, north, and east.

514 Dvisahasst majjhimā lokadhātu. It is necessary to use some such expression rather than "a two-thousandfold middling world system." For the middling world system is not twice the size of a thousandfold minor world system, but a thousand times its size, that is, a thousandfold world system squared. Similarly, just below, a tisahassī mahāsahassī lokadhātu is not three times the size of a minor world system, but a thousand times the size of a thousand-to-the-second-power middling world system, in other words, a thousandfold world system cubed.

515 Could this passage mark a major step toward the apotheosis of the Buddha? In flavor it seems more in keeping with the opening of such Mahāyāna sūtras as the Saddharmapundarīka and the Pañcavisati-prajñāpāramitā than with the Pāli Nikāyas.

516 Mp: "This was the elder Lāludāyī (a troublemaker in the Sangha). It is said that in the past he resented the elder [Ānanda for being appointed] the Buddha's attendant. Therefore, now that he had a chance, at the end of the Buddha's lion's roar, he tries to puncture the elder Ānanda's confidence, as if extinguishing a burning candle, hitting the snout of a stray bull, or turning upside down a vessel full of food."

517 Mp: "The Buddha says this, as if a benevolent man were to say repeatedly to another man tottering at the edge of a precipice, 'Come this way."

518 Ee treats this sutta as part of the preceding one, but Ce and Be treat it as distinct. Thus from the next sutta on, my numbering will be one short of Be and one ahead of Ee.

519 Ce ahampamhā, ahampamhā; Ee, virtually the same, merely resolves the sandhi: aham pi amhä, aham pi amhä. Be's aham pi dammo aham pi dammo seems to be an attempt to make sense of an obscure original. The Sinhala translation repeats the Pāli and adds in parentheses mama de gavayem, mama de gavayem, ("I too am a cow, I too am a cow"). DOP relates amhä to Skt hambhā, "the lowing of a cow, a cow." See SED, sv hambhä, "lowing or bellowing of cattle."

520 Mp: "The knowledge of destruction arises first (khayasmim pathamam ñanam): first the knowledge of the path arises, called the knowledge of destruction because it is the knowledge associated with the path, which is called destruction because it destroys the defilements. Immediately followed by final knowledge (tato añnā
anantara): right after the knowledge of the fourth path arises, the fruit of arahantship arises."

521 Mp: "The knowledge arises (ñannam ve hoti): this is reviewing knowledge" (paccavekkhanañanna); see Vism 676, Ppn 22.19-21.

522 Khuddānukhuddakāni sikkhāpadāni. At DN 16.6.3, II 154,16-17, shortly before his passing, the Buddha permitted the bhikkhus, if they so desired, to abolish these rules. However, in the Vinaya account of the first Buddhist council, the monks were uncertain about which rules were minor and therefore decided to retain them all (Vin II 287,29-288,35). Mp, commenting on the present sutta, says: "The teachers who specialize in the Great Anguttara Nikāya say, 'Apart from the four parajikas (offenses entailing expulsion), all the rest are lesser and minor'" (imé pana añguttaramahänikāyavaḷañjanaka-ācariya 'cattāri pārājikāni ṭhapetvā sesāni sabbānīpi khuddānukhuddakāni').

523 Na hi m'ettha, bhikkhave, abhabbatā vuttā. Mp paraphrases: "Bhikkhus, I have not stated that it is impossible for a noble person to fall into such an offense and to be rehabilitated" (bhikkhave na hi mayā ettha évarūpam āpattim āpajjane ca vutṭhāne ca ariyapuggalassa abhabbatā kathitā).

524 Tāni ādibrahmacariyikāni brahmacariyasāruppāni. Mp: "Those training rules that are fundamental to the spiritual life: these are the four major training rules fundamental to the spiritual life of the path. In conformity with the spiritual life: these same [rules] are in conformity with, fitting for, the spiritual life of the four paths" (ādibrahmacariyikānī ti maggabrahmacariyassa ādibhūtāni cattāri mahāsīlasikkhāpadāni; brahmacariyasāruppāni ti tāni yeva catumaggabrahmacariyassa sāruppāni anucchavikāni).

525 This is the first, and most sluggish, of the three grades of stream-

enterer. The other two follow just below. The Pāli names for the three are, respectively: sattakkhattuparama, kolamkola, and ekabijit.

526 These are five grades of non-returner, presented here from the most sluggish to the most acute. For a fuller discussion, see 7:55.

527 Tam vā pana anabhisambhavam appativijjham. Mp: "If he does not reach and penetrate that arahantship" (tam arahattaṃ apāpunanto appativijjhanto).

528 Mp , commenting on this verse and the previous one, says: "As before, so after: as earlier one trains in the three trainings, so one trains in them afterward; and so for the second line. As below, so above: as one sees the lower part of the body as unattractive, one extends this to the upper part; and inversely for the second
line. As by day, so at night: as one trains in the three trainings by day, so one trains in them at night; and inversely for the second line. Having overcome all quarters by way of the object, with measureless concentration, with the concentration of the path of arahantship."

529 I read with Be and Ee dhïram patipadantagum. Ce has vïram. Mp glosses: "A wise one endowed with wisdom; one who is wise in terms of the aggregates, wise in terms of the sense bases, gone to the end of the practice" (khandhadhira-āyatanadhiravasena dhïram dhitisampannam patipattiyā antam gatam).

530 Mp : "This is the arahant's emancipation of mind, occurring with the ceasing of the final consciousness. It is like the full extinguishing of a lamp. No place where it has gone is discerned; there is only arrival at the indiscernible state (apannattikabhāvūpagamano yeva hoti)."

531 Adhisallikhatev'āyam samano. Mp is not particularly helpful with adhisallikhati, glossing it ativiya sallikkhitam katvā samham șamham katheti. DOP has "is overly scrupulous." The expression also occurs in a similar context at MN I 449,12-13.

532 The sutta itself does not specify a triad, but I assume it is the distinction between elder, middling, and junior bhikkhus that warrants including this sutta in the Threes.

533 The printed version of Ce does not have an uddāna verse for this chapter, so I have used the verse in the electronic version of Ce for sutta titles.

534 Accayikāni. I translate in accordance with the gloss in Mp-t: sigham pavattabbāni, "to be taken care of quickly."

535 Mp: "Solitude with respect to robes (cīvarapaviveka): Separation from defilements arising on account of a robe. The same method with the other two [almsfood and lodgings]."

536 Mp : "This is said with reference to its abandoning by the path of stream-entry."

537 Ee mistakenly prints this sutta as belonging to the preceding one. Ce and Be , which I follow, treat it as independent.

538 Mp explains the dhammacakkhu with reference to the commentarial conception of momentary path experiences as the "eye of the path of stream-entry that comprehends the Dhamma of the four noble truths."

539 This phrase normally denotes the attainment of non-returning. Mp, however, identifies this disciple as a "jhāna non-returner" (jhānānägämī), that is, a stream-enterer or once-returner who also attains jhāna. Though such a practitioner has not yet eliminated the two fetters of sensual desire and ill will, by attaining jhāna he or she is bound to be reborn in the form realm and attain nibbāna there, without taking another rebirth in the sense sphere.

540 A partial synthesis of 2:43 and 2:44.

541 I translate potthako based on Mp's gloss väkamayavattham.

542 Text uses majjhimo, lit. "of middle age."

543 There are two triads in this sutta. Both the immoral and the virtuous monk are distinguished into the junior, the one of middle standing, and the elder, and this distinction forms a triad. Yet under each type, three statements are made-about the monk himself, his effect on those who associate with him, and the merit gained by gifts to him-which also constitute a triad. I indicate the major triad with Arabic numerals and the minor one with small Roman numerals.

544 In Ee, this sentence marks the end of this sutta and the next paragraph the beginning of a new one. I follow Ce and Be, which treat the passage on the cloth from Kassi as a continuation of the same sutta. My numbering will now exceed that of Ee by one.

545 Tassa tam vacanam ādheyyam gacchati gandhakaraṇdake va nam kāsikavattham nikkhipanti: This last sentence is included in Ee, in brackets, but not in Ce or Be. However, Pp 34,37-35,1, on tayo kāsikavatthūpamā puggalā, includes this sentence (but without nikkhipanti). I include it because the simile is a fitting counterpart to the one just above about expelling an immoral elder.

546 The first position, rejected by the Buddha, reads in Pali: Yo, bhikkhave, evam vadeyya, 'yathā yathā 'yam puriso kammam karoti tathā tathā tam patisamvediyati' ti, evam santam, bhikkhave, brahmacariyavāso na hoti, okāso na paññāyati sammā dukkhassa antakiriyaya. And the second, affirmed by him, reads: Yo ca kho, bhikkhave, evam vadeyya, 'yathā yathā vedanīyam ayam puriso kammam karoti tathā tathā 'ssa vipākam patisamvediyati' ti, evam santam, bhikkhave, brahmacariyavāso hoti, okāso paññāyati sammā dukkhassa antakiriyāya.

The exact difference between the two positions is not selfevident. Mp states by way of explanation: "In precisely the same way: If one says, 'One experiences the result of kamma in precisely the same way that one created it,' then, since it isn't possible to prevent the result of kamma once done, one would surely experience the result of whatever kamma one has created. In such a case, there could be no living of the spiritual life: kamma to be experienced upon rebirth, done prior to the development of the path, would necessarily have to be experienced, whether or not one has lived the spiritual life. No opportunity would be seen for completely making an end of suffering: since, in such a case, there is the accumulating of kamma by oneself and the experiencing of its result, therefore an opportunity would not be seen for making an end of the suffering of the round."

The point Mp is trying to make, it seems, is that if one has to
experience the result of every kamma one has created of the type to be experienced upon rebirth, and of every kamma one has created of the type to be experienced in some life subsequent to the next, one would have to continue into the next rebirth, and into indefinite future rebirths, in order to experience those results. In such a case, because those kammas are bound to ripen, one would have to remain in samsāra forever in order to experience their fruits. It is not at all evident from the sutta itself, however, that this is the intended meaning. It seems, rather, that what the sutta is saying is that one need not experience the result of kamma in exactly the same way that one created it (so that, for example, if one killed a person one would not have to be killed in turn). The point, then, is that when one's wholesome and unwholesome kammas ripen, they will have to be experienced, respectively, as pleasant and as painful, even though the quantum of pleasure and pain need not correspond to the moral force of the original action.

547 Mp explains this in terms of the Abhidhamma theory that kamma is created by the seven javunacittas, the karmically active mental events in a cognitive process. The first javana is of the type to be experienced in this present life (ditchadhammavedantya); if it misses the chance to ripen in this life, it becomes defunct (ahosi). The seventh javana is to be experienced after rebirth in the next life (upapajjavedantya), and if it misses the chance to ripen in that life, it becomes defunct. The middle five javanas are to be experienced on some subsequent occasion (aparapariyayavedantya), which means that they can ripen any time after the next life for as long as one continues in samsāra. Since this theory arose long after the compilation of the Nikāyas, it is improbable that it conveys the purport of the present passage. As I explained in note 546, the text seems to be saying simply that when one creates unwholesome kamma, one will experience its result as painful, whether to a strong degree or to a slight degree, but the degree of the result cannot be rigidly correlated with the severity of the original action. The converse holds with wholesome kamma, which is to be experienced as pleasant. It is this variability that allows a person, through the development of the path, to overcome the consequences of grave unwholesome kamma and thereby attain the end of suffering in samsāra. This interpretation seems to be borne out by the examples given in the sutta.

The Chinese parallel, MĀ 11 (at T I 433a12-434a11), does not make a clear distinction between two contrary positions. I read it thus: "The Buddha told the bhikkhus: '[If one says:] "One receives the result of kamma according to the way it has been
done by a person"-in this case, one does not practice the spiritual life and is unable to end suffering. If one says: "One receives the result of kamma according to the way it has been done by a person"-in this case, one practices the spiritual life and is able to end suffering" (世尊告誦比丘。隋人所作乘則受其報。如是。不行梵行不得盡苦。若作是說。隨人所作乘則受其報。如是。修行梵行便得盡

苦). Either there has been a mistake here in the textual transmission of the text, or the point in this version is that, of two people who hold the same view about karma, one does not practice and thus does not make an end to suffering, while the other practices and makes an end to suffering.

548 Paritto appātumo: Mp explains: "He is limited because of the limitation of his virtues (parittaguño). His self (ātuma) is his body (attabhāvo); even though his body may be large, he has a 'mean character' because of the limitation of his virtues." Atuma( $n$ ) is an alternative form of atta( $n$ ) (Skt ātman). Mp identifies it with attabhāva. The Chinese parallel reads the corresponding phrase (occurring at T I 433a2s) as "his life span is very short" (壽命遂短):

549 Text reads appadukkhavihārī, which does not fit the context well. Mp offers an unconvincing resolution of the compound: "He dwells in suffering because of his small evil deed" (appakenapi pāpena dukkhavihārī). The Chinese parallel has nothing corresponding to this against which to check it. I amend the text to read simply dukkhavihārī. It is possible that appa entered via a recitation error based on appamānavihārī just below.

550 Aparitto mahattā (Be: mahatto). Mp (Ce): "He is unlimited because his virtues are not limited; even when his body is small, he has 'a great character' because of the greatness of his virtues" (gunamahantatāya mahattā). Mp takes all these terms to imply that the person being described is an arahant, which is puzzling since, according to the Abhidhamma philosophy that underlies the commentaries, an arahant does not create any kamma at all. Again, the Chinese parallel (at T I 433b11) interprets this by way of the life span: "he has an extremely long life span" (壽命極長).

551 That is, a residue to be experienced in future lives.

552 Be is missing udakamallake here.

553 Kahāpana: The major unit of currency used in northern India during the Buddha's time.

554 Where Ce here reads kathamrūpo and below evarūpo, it is better to read with Be and Ee the accusatives kathamrūpam and evarūpam. These words are to be correlated with the accusative present participle ādiyamānam occurring in the middle of each sentence; they qualify, not the sheep merchant or butcher, but the person who has stolen the sheep. Curiously, in the counterpart on the
rich man, Ce has the right readings kathamrūpam and evarūpam, in agreement with Be and Ee.

555 I follow Ce here: dhamati sandhamati niddhamati. Tam hoti jātarūpam dhantam sandhantam niddhantam, anihitam anikkhittakasāvaṃ. Be has the same up to niddhantam, but it then omits anihitam and reads aniddhantakasāvaṃ where Ce has anikkhittakasāvaṃ. Ee allows a bracketed alternative: dhamati sandhamati [na] niddhamati. Tam hoti jātarūpam dhantam sandhantam aniddhantam, anihitam aninnittakasāvaṃ. An older Sri Lankan edition mentioned in a note to Ce also has aninnitakasāvaṃ.

556 I read with Ce and Be ñātivitakko, as against Ee jātivitakko, "thoughts about [social] class."

557 Anavaññattipatisamyutto vitakko. Lit. "thought connected with not being looked down upon." The Chinese parallel, SĀ 1246 (at T II 341c12-13), has "thought about rebirth in heaven" (生天覺).

558 Dhammavitakka. Mp glosses this as thoughts connected with the ten corruptions of insight (dasa vipassan'upakkilesavitakkā), but it seems this could just as well mean reflections on the teaching or on the meditation subject.

559 Readings differ between nappatipassaddhaladdho and nappatipassaddhiladdho. Discrepancies are found even within the same text. Ee is consistent, reading nappatippassaddhaladdho in the negative sentence and patippassaddhaladdho in the positive counterpart. Be, however, has nappatippassaddhaladdho and patippassaddhiladdho in the respective sentences. To make matters more confusing, Mp (Be) inverts the forms, reading nappatippassaddhiladdho in the lemma of the comment on the negative term, but patippassaddhaladdho in the lemma of the comment on the positive term. Mp (Be), commenting on this sutta, explains nappatippassaddhiladdho as "not gained by the full tranquilizing of defilements" (na kilesapatippassaddhiya laddho) and patippassaddhaladdho as "gained by the full tranquilizing of defilements" (kilesapatippassaddhīya laddho).

Ce reads na patippassaddhiladdho and patippassaddhiladdho in the sutta, but Mp (Ce) has na patippassaddhaladdho and patippassaddhaladdho in the respective lemmas. Moreover, in 5:27 (where only the positive term occurs), Ce and Be have patippassaddhaladdho, as against Ee patippassaddhiladdho. Mp (Ce) here reads patippassaddhiladdho in the lemma, as against Mp (Be) patippassaddhaladdho. Mp says that patippassaddham and patippassaddhi are one in meaning (idam atthato ekam), proposing two resolutions: "It is gained by the full tranquilizing of defilements, or it has gained the full tranquilization of defilements
(kilesapatippassaddhiyā laddhattā kilesapatippassaddhibhāvaṃ vā laddhattā), thus it is patippassaddhiladdho."

560 Ce and Ee sasañkhāraniggayhavāritavato; in place of-vato Be reads the termination as gato. I interpret sasañkhāra as "forceful" (lit. "with exertion"); niggayha as "having suppressed"; vürita as "reined in"; and (following Ce) -vato as "checked." A rendering based on the Be variant might be: "but is reached when [the defilements] are reined in by forcefully suppressing [them]."

561 Ce and Ee na sasañkhāraniggayhavāritavato; Be-gato. SĀ 1246 (atT II 341c21-22) has: "The bhikkhu attains concentration that is not maintained by exertion; he attains the peaceful and sublime, the quiescent happy state, the unified mind, in which all the taints are destroyed" (比丘得諸三昧。不為有行所持。得寂靜勝妙。得息樂道・一心一意・盡諸有漏).

562 Yassa yassa ca abhiñña sacchikarañyassa dhammassa cittam abhininnāmeti abhiñña sacchikiriyāya tatra tatreva sakkhibhabbatami pāpunāti sati sati āyatane. Mp explains the "suitable basis" as "past causes and the presently obtainable jhāna, and other things, which are the basis for the direct knowledges" (pubbahetusainkhatc. cevà idāni ca patiladdhabbe abhiññāpadakajjhānādibhede ca sati sati kārane). The expression occurs at Vism 371,26-33, Ppn 11.122, and is commented upon at Vism-mhṭ (VRI ed. I 429). Vism 376,28378,2, Ppn 12.14-19, explains the basis for the direct knowledges to be the concentrated mind that has acquired eight qualities: namely, it is (1) purified, (2) cleansed, (3) unblemished, (4) rid of defilement, (5) malleable, (6) wieldy, (7) steady, and (8) attained to imperturbability. Alternatively, it says, "concentrated" may be considered the first quality and "steady and attained to imperturbability" jointly constitute the eighth.

563 This begins the standard canonical passage on the six kinds of direct knowledge (abhiñña): The first five are commented on in detail in Vism chaps. 12 and 13.

564 I here follow Ce and Be , which put the liberated mind before the unliberated mind, as against Ee, which inverts them.

565 Ee treats this as a continuation of the preceding sutta, while in Ce and Be , which are clearly correct, it is a different sutta. With the next sutta, my numbering will again exceed Ee's by two.

566 Tīni nimittāni. Mp glosses as "three causes" (tīni kārañāni). The three nimittas are samädhinimitta, paggahanimitta, and upekkhānimitta.

567 In SN, this "template" and the two to follow are applied separately to the four elements (14:31-33, II 169-73), the five aggregates (22:26-28, III 27-31), and the six sense bases (35:13-18, IV $6-13$ ).

568 Ee treats this sutta as a continuation of the preceding one, whereas Ce and Be , which I follow, consider it distinct. Thus my numbering will exceed Ee's by three.

569 Again, Ee treats this sutta as a continuation of the preceding one, whereas Ce and Be , which I follow, count it separately. Thus from the next sutta on my numbering exceeds Ee's by four.

570 Setughāto gitte, setughāto nacce. Mp: "Let there be the demolition of the condition for singing. He shows: 'Abandon singing together with its cause.' The same method with regard to dancing." On setughäto, see above, note 497. Alam vo dhammappamoditānam satam sitam sitamattāya. Mp: "When there is a reason to smile [in rejoicing in the Dhamma], it is proper to smile merely by showing the tips of your teeth simply to show that you are pleased."

571 I here use "deed" for kammanta and "action" for kamma. In this context it seems there is no real difference between the two, the text itself shifting from one to the other as if they were synonymous. "Tainted" renders avassuta, past participle of avassavati, related via the verb savati, "to flow," to the noun āsava.

572 I use one word where the Pāli uses two synonymous terms for death, maranam and kālakiriya.

573 Mp: "This kamma brings the origination-that is, the accumula-tion-of other kamma leading toward the round [of rebirths]."

574 Ee treats this sentence as the end of the sutta and the next sentence as the beginning of a new sutta. Ce and Be , in accordance with the uddāna verse, take this to be a single sutta divided into two parts by way of the unwholesome and wholesome roots.

575 Mp: "This kamma leads to the origination of kammas going toward the end of the round [of rebirths]."

576 Ee again treats this sentence as the end of the sutta and the next as the beginning of a new sutta (no. 110), while Ce and Be , which I follow, take this to be a single sutta divided into two sections. My numbering, from the next sutta on, exceeds Ee's by two.

577 Here-and in the parallel passages below-I follow the Ce reading: . . . tadabhinivajjeti. Tadabhinivajjetvā cetasā abhivirājetvā. Be has tadabhinivatteti. Tadabhinivattetvā cetasā abhinivijjhitvā. Ee has tadabhinivaddheti and tadabhinivadäthetvā, which cannot be correct. However, just below Ee agrees with Ce, as against Be, in reading abhiviräjetvā.

578 Paññāya ativijjha passati. Mp: "One sees having penetrated it with the wisdom of the path together with insight."

579 So kämesu pātavyataṃ āpajjati (Be adds tāya before kämesu, probably representing tāya ditthiyā). Mp: "Indulgence: [the view that] they are to be drunk, to be enjoyed; [he thinks they are] to be enjoyed with a mind without hesitation, just as water is to be drunk by
one who is thirsty" (pivitabbataṃ paribhunjitabbataṃ nirāsañkena cittena pipāsitassa pānīyapivanasadisam paribhunjitabbataṃ). Ps II 371,22-24, commenting on pātabyatam apajjanti at MN I 305.21, says: "He falls into [the view that] one should drink up sensual objects with the defilement of sensuality, that they are to be enjoyed according to one's pleasure" (te vatthukāmesu kilesakāmena pātabyatam pivitabbataṃ, yathāruci paribhunjitabbataṃ āpajjantī ti attho). Pātabba (= pātāvya) occurs as an optative participle of pivati, to drink, at Vin II 208,11. MN 45.2, I 305, ascribes this view to "ascetics and brahmins" who "consort with women wanderers wearing their hair in a topknot."

580 According to the Theravāda Abhidhamma, on passing away from the formless realm, a worldling may be reborn on the same formless plane, on a higher formless plane, or in the sense sphere with a three-rooted rebirth consciousness. This means that they will be reborn either as an intelligent human being or as a deva. Rebirth into the lower planes can occur in later rebirths, but not in the rebirth immediately following the fall from the formless realm. See CMA 226-27.

581 I read with Ce and Ee: yadidam gatiya upapattiya sati. Be omits sati here (and in the next two paragraphs), but includes it in the parallels at 4:123 and 4:125. Mp, commenting on 4:123, explains: "When there is future destination and rebirth, the noble disciple who is a trainee does not descend to a lower rebirth but attains final nibbāna in the same form-sphere existence [or] in a higher realm." The same applies, with the appropriate modification, to those reborn in formless-sphere existence.

Mp-t to 4:123 sheds light on the question how noble disciples can be reborn in the formless realm: "When the Buddha speaks of the life spans of humans and devas, he does not give specific figures for the life span [of those] in the four planes of misery and earth-bound devas. Why not? Because in hell, kamma alone determines [the life span]; one suffers there until one's kamma is exhausted. The same holds for the other planes of misery. Kamma also determines the life span for earth-bound devas. For some reborn there remain there only for a week, some for two weeks, and some for an eon.

"Among humans, some laypeople become stream-enterers and attain the fruit of once-returning, the fruit of non-returning, and even arahantship. Of these, stream-enterers, etc., can remain [in the lay life] their entire lives, but arahants either attain final nibbāna or go forth [into homelessness]. Why? Because arahantship is the most virtuous state and the lay life is inferior. It isn't possible for arahants to sustain the most virtuous state in an inferior condition, so they either attain final nibbāna [i.e., pass
away] or go forth. But when earth-bound devas attain arahantship they remain their entire lives; stream-enterers and oncereturners among the six classes of sense-sphere devas remain. their entire lives. For a non-returner it is suitable to go to a form-sphere existence, and for arahants to attain final nibbāna. Why? Because there is no chance that they might regress. In the form and formless realms, all remain for their entire life spans. Stream-enterers and once-returners reborn in the form realm do not return to this world, but attain final nibbāna there. They are called 'jhāna non-returners.'

"But what determines [rebirth] for those who gain the eight meditative attainments? The jhāna in which they are proficient does, for they are reborn in accordance with whatever they are proficient in. If they are proficient in all, what determines [their rebirth]? The attainment of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, for they are definitely reborn in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. For noble disciples reborn among the nine brahma worlds, rebirth may occur there [in the same plane] or in a higher one, but not in a lower one. But worldlings may be reborn in the same plane, in a higher one, or in a lower one. Noble disciples in the five pure abodes and the four formless planes may be reborn in the same plane or in a higher one. A non-returner reborn in the plane of the first jhāna purifies the nine brahma worlds and attains final nibbāna while dwelling at the peak. Three deva worlds are called the 'best states of existence': the plane of great fruit (vehapphala), Akanittha, and the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. Non-returners reborn in these three states do not go higher, nor lower, but attain final nibbāna right there."

582 Apannako mani. Mp-t says it is a special kind of die with six surfaces, similar to a jewel, used by those devoted to the game of dice (evaṃ chahi talehi samannāgato pāsakakīlāpasutānaṃ manisadiso pāsakaviseso). I use the more familiar plural form rather than the singular "die."

583 The definition of mental purity here replicates the section of the Satipaṭthāna Sutta on contemplation of the five hindrances (DN 22.13, II 300,4-301,24; MN 10.36, I 60,7-36).

584 Again, I rely on the summary verse in Ce (electronic) for titles.

585 Mp : "In the first twenty years after the enlightenment, the Tathāgata often stayed among the deva communities (devakulesuyeva): sometimes at the Cāpāla Shrine, sometimes at the Sārandada, sometimes at the Bahuputta, and sometimes at the Gotamaka. Since he was living at Vesālī at this time, he stayed at the abode of the Gotamaka spirit." Mp explains that this sutta was spoken as a sequel to the Mūlapariyāya Sutta (MN 1). The
background story, told at Ps I 56-59, and translated at Bodhi 2006: 82-86, relates that a group of brahmins had taken ordination under the Buddha and quickly mastered his teachings. Filled with pride on account of their learning, they no longer went to listen to the Dhamma. The Buddha spoke the Mūlapariyāya Sutta to cut down their pride. Unable to understand it, they were humbled and apologized to the Buddha. Sometime later the Buddha spoke this Gotamaka Sutta to guide them to arahantship.

586 Mp-t explains thus: "Through direct knowledge (abhimnaya): He teaches the Dhamma after directly knowing, according to actuality, the Dhamma to be taught, distinguished by way of the wholesome and so forth and by way of the aggregates and so forth; and after directly knowing the method to teach those who are to be guided in accordance with their propensities, tendencies, characters, and dispositions. With a basis (sanidanam): with conditions (sappaccayam), with grounds (sakäranam); having brought forth a reason (hetu), which might be the inclination of those to be guided, a question, or a special incident. Antidotal (sappatihariyam): an antidote is a remedy (patiharana) for lust and so forth. The Dhamma is accompanied by these, so it is 'antidotal.' For the Teacher teaches the Dhamma just by way of the elimination (patisedhanavasen'eva) of lust and so forth."

The term sappatihäriya is problematic. Elsewhere patihärya is used in the sense of a wonder or miracle, as in 3:60 (at I 17072), which speaks of the three "wonders": of psychic potency, thought-reading, and instruction. PED, sv patihärya, sees sappatihäriya as derived from this usage and suggests, in contexts related to the Dhamma, "wonderful, extraordinary, sublime." I find it hard, however, to agree that such a meaning is intended in this context. The verb patiharati means "to strike back," and the causative patihareti "to repel, to avoid." I believe that this sense is relevant both to its use here and in relation to miracles. A miracle "strikes against" the mind's fixed conceptual premises and opens it to the reality of the wondrous. But the Dhamma strikes in a different way. It "strikes against" distorted views and defilements, and thus it is counteractive or antidotal. This interpretation is supported by 8:70 (IV 310-11), where the Buddha states that his disciples "can thoroughly refute in reasoned ways the current tenets of others and teach the sappatihariya Dhamma" (uppannam parappavädam sahadhammena suniggehitam niggahetvä sappatihäriyam dhammaṃ desessanti). Here the sappatihäriya character of the Dhamma must be related, not to miracles, but to its ability to counteract opposed tenets. Thus "antidotal" or "counteractive" would render the sense well.

587 Purānasabrahmacärī. Mp says that they had lived together at

Ālāra Kālāma's hermitage. Ālāra Kālāma was one of the meditation masters under whom the future Buddha trained before his enlightenment. See MN I 163-64.

588 Apparently this is Hatthaka of $\bar{A} l a v i ̄$ (see 1:251), though Mp does not identify him as such.

589 Mp explains dhamm $\bar{a} \ldots$..pavattino as "the Buddha-word that you learned in the past" (pubbe uggahitabuddhavacanam).

590 Mp : "Teachings that he has forgotten because he neglected to recite them."

591 Aviha: One of the five pure abodes (suddhāvāsa) into which only non-returners are reborn.

592 Goyogapilakkhasmiṃ. Mp: "Near the fig tree that had grown up at the place for selling cattle." PED explains pilakkha as a wavyleaved fig tree.

593 Rittassādam bāhirassādam. Mp: "Dissatisfied: lacking the pleasure of the jhānas. [Seeking] gratification outwardly: the gratification of sensual pleasure." The Chinese parallel, SĀ 1081 (T II 283a20283b26) says (at 283a23) that "he had given rise to an unwholesome thought connected with evil craving" (起不善覺，以依感言).

594 Mā kho tvaṃ attānaṃ kaṭuvīyam akāsi. Mp glosses katuvīyaṃ simply as ucchittham, "left over" food, without further explanation. DOP defines the word as "(what is) left over; (what is) polluted, impure."

595 Be āmagandhena; Ce and Ee āmagandhe. See Āmagandha-sutta, Sn 239-52. Mp: "The foul odor consisting in anger."

596 Samvegamāpādi. Mp: "He became a stream-enterer." The suttas normally use a stock formula to indicate attainment of streamentry, but nothing of this formula is found in the present text.

597 Ce reads pāda b aladdhā samamattano; Be aladdhā samathumattano; Ee sammamattano. I prefer the Ce reading. All three editions read the verb in pāda c as pareti, which Mp glosses with gacchati.

598 Nāsayitvāna makkhika. The absolutive is from the verb nāseti, "to destroy."

599 The exact import of this is not clear to me. Perhaps the sense is that women are best kept within the home rather than permitted to go out in public places on their own. The Chinese parallel, EĀ 22.4 (at T II 607b26-607c11), is exactly like the Pāli, though it includes a verse which simply reiterates the same statements as in the prose portion of the sutta.

600 The first two are at 2:47. On "the assembly trained to the limits" (Ce yāvatāvavinitā parisā; Be yāvatāvinitā parisā; Ee yāvatajjhāvinitā parisā), Mp says: "Trained by way of its capacity, meaning an assembly trained after one has known its capacity" (pamānavasena
vinitā, pamānam ñatvā vinitaparisa ti attho). This seems to be a unique occurrence of the expression in the Nikāyas. Mp also recognizes a reading yāvatajjhā, which it explains as "an assembly trained after one has known its inclination" (yāva ajjhasayaa ti attho, ajjhāsayaṃ ñatva vinitaparisa ti vuttam hoti). Vanarata prefers a Burmese variant mentioned in a note in Ee, yāvatajjanivinitā parisā, which he understands to be "an assembly that gives in to training only as long as (yāva) threats are applied."

601 Thitä sā dhātu dhammatṭhitatā dhammaniyāmata. Mp offers only an unhelpful word gloss based on the identification of a dhamma with a thing that bears a real nature (sabhāva): Dhammatṭhitatā ti sabhāvaṭthitatā. Dhammaniyāmatā ti sabhāvaniyāmatā.

602. Mp explains impermanent (anicca) here as non-existent after having come to be (hutvā abhāvatthena); suffering (dukkha) as oppression (sampt!anaṭthena dukkhā); and non-self (anattā) as not subject to the exercise of mastery (avasavattanatthena). In SN 12:20, II 25-27; this same framework is applied to the twelvefold formula of dependent origination.

603 Ce kesakambalo tesam pāvarānam patikittho, as against Be and Ee kesakambalo tesam patikittho. PED defines pavara as "a cloak, a mantle."

604 See 1:319 for another critique of Makkhali Gosāla. The simile of the trap recurs at the end of this sutta.

605. Ee treats this sutta as a continuation of the preceding one, whereas Ce and Be , which I follow, treat it as separate. Thus my numbering will again exceed Ee's by three.

606 Ce and Ee tayo ca assasadasse . . . tayo ca purisasadasse. Lit., "the three kinds of good horses among horses and the three kinds of good horses among men."

607. Ee at I 291-92 combines this sutta and the next two into one, 3:140 in its numbering. Ce and Be count each separately. See 11:10, which merges them into a single sutta supplemented by two additional factors for a total of eleven qualities. From 3:146 on, my numbering exceeds Ee's by five.

608 The one beyond training (asekha) is the arahant.

609. Ee does not number this as a separate vagga but titles it Acelakavagga. Ce counts it as the sixth vagga in the third Fifty, called Patipadāvagga. Be also counts it as the sixth vagga (sixteenth in its total for the Threes), called Acelakavagga, "Chapter on the Naked Ascetic."

610. I base this title on the uddāna verse of Be. Neither Ce nor Be assigns a title to this sutta; neither Ce nor Ee has an uddāna verse.

611 The coarse way of practice (āga!ha patipadā) corresponds to the
extreme of indulgence in sensual pleasure; the blistering way of practice (nijjhämā patipadā), to the extreme of self-mortification. Those are the two extremes that the Buddha rejected in his first discourse (SN 56:11, V 421,4-9).

612 The following list of ascetic practices is also at DN I 166-67; MN I 77-78, 307-8, 342-43.

613 Ee compresses all these into a single sutta numbered 152 . I follow Ce and Be in counting each as a distinct sutta.

614 Ee joins each pair of suttas, respectively on qualities that lead to hell and to heaven; into a single sutta, and thus counts ten suttas (153-62, in its enumeration). Ce and Be, which I follow, enumerate each pair of contrasting suttas separately and thus count twenty suttas.

615 Be and Ee count only one sutta here, 184 and 163 in their respective enumerations. Ce, which I follow, counts 170 suttas.

616 With Be and Ee, I read simply tayo dhammā rather than ime tayo dhamma with Ce .

617 Suññato samädhi, animitto samädhi, appanihito samädhi. Mp says only that "insight is explained by means of them (tīhipi samädhīhi vipasssanā va kathitā)." The three are mentioned as a set at DN III 219,21-22, again without explanation, but Sv III 1003-4 comments: "The explanation is threefold, by way of arrival (āgamanato), by way of quality (sagunato), and by way of object (ärammanato). (1) By way of arrival, (i) one bhikkhu interprets in terms of non-self, sees in terms of non-self, and reaches the path by [contemplation of] non-self; for him, insight is called 'emptiness.' Why? Because of the absence of the defilements responsible for [the idea of] self or non-emptiness: The concentration of the path (maggasamädhi), being reached by insight, is called emptiness; and the concentration of the fruit (phalasamädhi), being reached by the path, is also called emptiness. (ii) Another interprets in terms of impermanence, sees in terms of impermanence, and reaches the path by [contemplation of] impermanence; for him, insight is called 'markless.' Why? Because of the absence of the defilements responsible for marks. The concentration of the path, being reached by insight, is called markless; and the concentration of the fruit, being reached by this path, is also called markless. (iii) Another interprets in terms of suffering, sees in terms of suffering, and reaches the path by [contemplation of] suffering; for him, insight is called 'wishless.' Why? Because of the absence of the defilements responsible for wishes. The concentration of the path, being reached by insight, is called wishless; and the concentration of the fruit, being reached by this path, is also called wishless. (2) By way of quality: The conçentration
of the path is empty because it is empty of lust, etc.; it is markless, because the marks of lust, etc., are absent; and it is wishless because wishes caused by lust, etc., are absent. (3) By way of object: Nibbāna is emptiness because it is empty of lust, etc.; it is markless and wishless, because it is without the marks of lust, etc., and without wishes caused by lust, etc." Vism 657,13-259,10, Ppn 21.66-73, discusses the three "gateways to liberation" (vimuttimukha) under the same three names.

# Notes to the Fours

618 What follows is included in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta, DN 16.4.2-3, II 122-23.

619 Dīghamaddhānaṃ sandhāvitaṃ samsaritam. The "long stretch" of wandering is samsāra, derived from the verb samsarati, seen here in the past participle samsaritam. Mp glosses dīghamaddhānaṃ with cirakālaṃ ("a long time") and explains sandhāvitaṃ as "roamed by going from one state of existence to another" (bhavato bhavam gamanavasena sandhāvitaṃ).

620 Bhavanetti. Mp: "The rope of existence (bhavarajju) is a name for craving. Just as oxen are bound by a rope around the neck, so this leads beings from one existence to another. Therefore it is called the conduit to existence."

621 Cakkhumā parinibbuto. Mp: "He attained nibbāna by the extinction of defilements. This was the first nibbāna, which occurred for him in the vicinity of the bodhi tree. But afterward, between the twin sal trees (at Kusinārā) he attained nibbāna by the nibbāna element without residue remaining."

622 Appatito. Lit., "not fallen," but Mp glosses it more positively with patittho, meaning "established, settled," and says it refers to the stream-enterer and other noble ones; the arahant is "entirely settled" (khināsavo ekantapatittho).

623 The verse is also at Th 63. Th-a I 155: "Done is the task (katam kiccam): The sixteenfold task has been done (that is, each of the four noble paths performs the four tasks of fully understanding suffering, abandoning its origin, realizing its cessation, and developing the path) and there is nothing more to be done. The delightful is delighted in (ratam rammam): The delightful nibbāna, free from all that is conditioned, is delighted in by the noble ones. Happiness is reached by happiness (sukhenanvāgataṃ sukham): The ultimate happiness, nibbāna, is reached by the happiness of fruition attainment; or the happiness of fruition and of nibbāna is arrived at by the happiness of insight and the path through a pleasant mode of practice (on this, see 4:162 §§3-4 below)."

624. These three verses recur at 10:89 with reference to the slanderous bhikkhu Kokālika. The story, including verses, is also at SN 6:9-10, I 149-53, and Sn 3:10, pp. 123-31.

Vicināti mukhena so kalim, kalinā tena sukham na vindati. This could also have been rendered: "The fool collects a disaster with his mouth." Kali means both disaster and the losing throw at dice.

625 Mp : "This disaster is trifling, that is, the loss of wealth at dice along with all that one owns, including oneself." Mp glosses sugatesu, "holy ones," as sammaggatesu puggalesu, "persons who have rightly attained," thus referring to all arahants, not only to the Buddha.

626 Sataṃ sahassānaṃ nirabbudānaṃ/chattiṃsatī pañca ca-ābbudāni. I translate following Mp, which says of the numbers: "A hundred thousand nirabbudas, plus thirty-six more nirabbudas, plus five abbudas" (sataṃ sahassānan ti nirabbudagananāya satasahassam; chattiṃsatī ti aparāni ca chattiṃsati nirabbudāni; pañca cā ti abbudagananāya ca pañca abbudāni). Vānarāta, however, holds that pañca cannot directly qualify abbudānam and therefore he would conjoin sahassānam with chattiṃsatī and pañca as well, making thirty-six thousand additional nirabbudas and five thousand abbudas. Mp, commenting on 10:89, explains the Buddhist numbering scheme as follows: one koti $=$ ten million; a koti of kotis $=$ one pakoti; a koti of pakotis = one kotipakoti; a koti of kotipakotis = one nahuta; a koti of nahutas = one ninnahuta; a koti of ninnahutas $=$ one abbuda; twenty abbudas $=$ one nirabbuda.

627 The verse is also at 3:31 and 4:63, but here dhammacariyaya replaces paricariyaya.

628 In Pāli: anusotagāmī puggalo, patisotagāmī puggalo, thitatio puggalo, timo pärangato thale tiṭthati brähmano.

629 Reading with Be and Ee upagāmino, as against Ce upagähino.

630 Paripuṇnasekho. Mp: "One firm in fulfillment of the training" (sikkhāpāripūriya thito). A trainee (sekha) is one who has entered the irreversible path to liberation but has not yet attained arahantship. The arahant is asekha, "one beyond training."

631 In Pāli: suttan, geyyaṃ, veyyākaranan, gāthā, udānaṃ, itivuttakam, jātakam, abbhutadhammam, vedallam. This is the early ninefold division of the Dhamma, eventually superseded by the arrangement of the texts into the five Nikāyas. See Norman 1983: 15-16; Norman 2006a: 172-73. Mp, in line with other commentaries, gives examples of each genre, not all of which would be approved bymodern scholarship. It is a disputed question whether some items in the list refer to collections that already existed in the Buddha's time or to prototypes on the basis of which the present collections were established. Present scholarly opinion leans

632 I follow Be, which reads tassa sampajjate sutam in pāda d of this verse and nāssa sampajjate sutam, "his learning has not succeeded," in pāda d of the next verse. Ce reads nāssa sampajjate sutam here and tassa sampajjate sutam in the next verse, while Ee has nāssa sampajjate sutam in both places. Mp supports Be by explaining, in relation to this verse: "His learning can be said to have succeeded because this person has used what he has learned to achieve the purpose of learning." And in relation to the next verse, Mp says: "It [his learning] does not succeed because he has not achieved the purpose of learning." The verses are cited at Vism 48, Ppn 1.136, but with differences in readings among the several editions.

633 Mp glosses brahma here as "best, supreme, pure" (settham utiamam visuddham) and identifies brahmacakka with dhammacakka, the wheel of the Dhamma.

634 See 3:64 and p. 1651, note 451.

635 Vanarata writes with regard to pāda c: "I think that patvā is a mistaken adaptation from an original early Pāli puttā, which can be both absolutive and past participle. When Pāli was reshaped, the wrong alternative was chosen. Pattā, being past participle, should have been left unchanged" (personal communication). I read pāda d with Be visāradam vādapathātivattam, a reading shared with older Sinhala manuscripts. Ce has visāradam vādapathātivattinam, which is also plausible, but Ee visāradam vādapathāti vuttam is certainly mistaken.

636 Itthabhāvaññathābhāvam. Mp: "Life here" is this existence (ayam attabhāvo); "life elsewhere" is a future existence (anāgatattabhāvo).

637 Bhavānam. Mp distinguishes kāmayoga as lust connected with the five objects of sensual pleasure and bhavayoga as desire and lust for existence in the form and formless realms.

638 Reading with Ce and Be yogātigā munī, as against Ee yogātigāmino.

639 Also at It $\S 110,115-18$.

640 I read with Ce thīnamiddham uddhaccakukkuccam vicikicchā pahīna hoti (Ee is the same, but with honti), as against Be thīnamiddham vigatam hoti uddhaccakukkuccam vigatam hoti vicikicchā pahīna hoti.

641 "Namuci": a name for Māra, which the commentaries explain as "he does not ( $n a$ ) set free ( $m u c i$ )."

642 Bhaddakam samādhinimittam. The six mentioned here are included among the ten asubha meditation subjects in Vism chap. 6.

643 Rāhu is the asura chief who abducts the sun and moon, obviously representing the solar and lunar eclipses. See SN 2:9-10, I $50-51$.

644 A primeval king, descended from Mahāsammata, son of Upo-satha, and an ancestor of the Sakvana (see DPPN). Mn: "He was
reborn among humans when the life span was immeasurable and enjoyed human sense pleasures for a long time, causing a rain of gold to fall whenever he wanted. In the deva world, during the life spans of thirty-six Indras, he enjoyed excellent sensual pleasures."

645 Mp: "Kinds of exquisiteness [or fineness, delicacy, subtlety]: knowledges that penetrate subtle characteristics" (sokhummänī ti sukhumalakkhaṇapativijjhanakāni ñānāni). The noun sokhumma, from the common adjective sukhuma, is rare and in the Nikāyas appears to occur only here and in a compound at Th 437. Mp's explanation seems to me problematic. I would identify exquisiteness of form with the form perceived in the fourth jhāna, exquisiteness of feeling with the neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling occurring in the fourth jhāna and the formless attainments, exquisiteness of perception with the perception in the base of nothingness, and exquisiteness of volitional activities with the residual volitional activities in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.

646 I read with Ce and Be sa ve sammaddaso bhikkhu. Be's sace for sa ve is clearly a mistake.

647 Bhattuddesika. The bhikkhu responsible for assigning meal offerings and invitations to the other bhikkhus. On his credentials and disqualifications, see 5:272.

648 Be mentions all four motives: chand $\bar{a}$ dos $\bar{a}$ moh $\bar{a}$ ca bhaya gāmino. And in the next verse: na chand $\bar{a}$ na dos $\bar{a}$ na moh $\bar{a}$ na bhaya ca gāmino.

649 SN 6:2, I 138-40, records the incident in direct narrative mode. It includes a fifth factor: the knowledge and vision of liberation. Since it is set at the time of the Buddha's enlightenment, it makes no mention of the Sangha, which arose only after the Buddha began to teach.

650 Ce reads atthakāmena; Be and Ee have attakāmena, "desiring self." In pāda d, the plural of Buddha is in the Pāli, buddhānasāsanaṃ. Possibly the compound is a corruption of buddhānusāsanaṃ, "the Buddha's instruction," which would preserve a singular.

651 The placement of this sutta in the period just after the Buddha's enlightenment seems strange. The words of the brahmins suggest that the Buddha, from a position of authority, participated in regular discussions with brahmins; yet he surely would not have done so before he began his career as a teacher. See 8:11, where a brahmin makes the same charge against the Buddha at a later time when he had already become a successful teacher.

652 I follow Ce in taking the poem to consist of three stanzas of
six pädas each. Be divides it into four stanzas, the first with six pädas, the other three with four pädas.

653 In pāda c, I read with Ce saññato thiradhammesu, as against Be and Ee saññato dhiro dhammesu, "self-controlled and steadfast among phenomena." In this, I follow Vanarata's suggestion (in a personal communication) that the Ce reading "has the merit of both fitting the meter better and supplying a pun (between thira and thera, firm and elder)." This clause corresponds to the jhānas, "factors of firmness" referring to samädhi. Mp glosses "who clearly sees the meaning with wisdom" (paññāyattham vipassati) as seeing the meaning of the four noble truths with the wisdom of the path along with insight. It explains "gone beyond all phenomena" (pāragū sabbadhammānam) as "gone beyond all such phenomena as the five aggregates" and "gone to the consummation of all [good] qualities" by the sixfold going beyond (chabbidhena pāragamanena): with respect to direct knowledge, full understanding, abandoning, development, realization, and meditative attainments. Mp does not explain the repetition of patibhānavā ("discerning") in the verse, which seems peculiar.

654 Also at It §112, 121-23.

655 Mp identifies the world (loka) with the truth of suffering. The four tasks that the Tathāgata has accomplished here correspond to the four tasks regarding the four noble truths-fully understanding the truth of suffering, abandoning the truth of its origin, realizing its cessation, and developing the path-but with "fully awakened" (abhisambuddha) replacing "fully understood" (pariññāta) in regard to the first truth. See SN 56:11, V 422.

656 Mp, like other commentaries, explains the seen (diṭtha) as the visible-form base; the heard (suta) as the sound base; the sensed (muta) as the bases of odor, taste, and tactile sensations; and the cognized (viññatam) as the mental-phenomena base. The three terms "reached, sought after, examined by the mind" (pattam pariyesitam anuvicaritam manasā) are simply elaborations of the cognized. Mp also explains that the suffix-gata, lit. "gone," in the derivation of the word "Tathāgata," means the same as abhisambuddha, "fully awakened to."

657 Ce and Ee have merely parinibbāyati, as against Be anupādisesāya nibbānadhātuyā parinibbāyati, "attains final nibbāna by way of the nibbāna element without residue remaining." The latter reading may have entered Be from It $\S 112,121,21-22$.

658 Sabbam tam tath'eva hoti, no aññathā. Tasmā 'tathāgato' ti vuccati.

659 Yathāvādi tathākārī, yathākārī tathāvādi.... Tasmā 'tathāgato' ti vuccati.

660 Ce has this in brackets. Be and Ee do not have it at all.

661 According to Mp, Kālaka was a wealthy financier and the father-in-law of Anāthapiṇdika's daughter Cūlasubhaddā. At the time of her marriage, he had been a devotee of the naked ascetics and knew nothing about the Buddha or his teaching. Cūlasubhaddā contrived to get him to invite the Buddha and the monks for a meal offering. After the meal, the Buddha gave a discourse that established him in the fruit of stream-entry. Kālaka then built a monastery in his park and donated both monastery and park to the Buddha. One day, when the bhikkhus who were natives of Sāketa were sitting in the meeting hall discussing the Buddha's success in converting Kālaka, the Buddha read their minds and knew they were ready for a discourse that would settle them in arahantship. It would also cause the great earth to quake up to its boundaries. Hence he addressed the bhikkhus.

662 Mp: "By these three terms (jänämi, abbhaññāsiṃ, viditam) the plane of omniscience (sabbaññutabhumi) is indicated." In the history of Buddhism, as well as in modern scholarship, the question whether the Buddha claimed omniscience has been a subject of debate. The Buddha certainly rejected the claim that one could know everything all the time (see MN 71.5, I 482,4-18) as well as the claim that one could know everything simultaneously (see MN 90.8, II 127,28-30). But he also says that to hold that he totally rejects the possibility of omniscience is to misrepresent him (MN 90.5, II 126,31-27,11). Thus it seems to follow that what the Buddha rejected is the possibility of continuous and simultaneous knowledge of everything, but not discrete and intentional knowledge of whatever can be known (which would exclude much of the future, since it is not predetermined).

663 Tam tathägato na upatṭhāsi. Mp: "The Tathāgata did not become subservient to any object at the six sense doors, that is, he did not take it up (na upagañchi) through craving or views. For it is said: 'The Blessed One sees a form with the eye, but he has no desire and lust for it; the Blessed One is fully liberated in mind.... The Blessed One cognizes a phenomenon with the mind, but he has no desire and lust for it; the Blessed One is fully liberated in mind' (see SN 35:232, IV 164-65). By this the plane of arahantship (khināsavabhūmi) is indicated."

664 Tam p'assa tādisameva. Mp: "That too would just be false speech."

665 Tam mam'assa kali. Mp: "That statement would be a fault of mine. With the above three statements, the plane of truth (saccabhumi) is indicated."

666 Mp: "He does not misconceive (na mañatati) visible form by way
of craving, conceit, or views; and so for the other objects. By this passage, the plane of emptiness (suññatäbhūmi) is explained."

667 The word täd $\bar{\imath}$, originally a simple referential term meaning "that one," takes on a special sense when used to designate the Buddha or an arahant. Nidd I 114-15 explains that an arahant is called täd $\bar{\imath}$ because he has transcended preferences, given up (catto) defilements, crossed (tinno) the floods, and has a liberated (mutto) mind.

Mp: "Being ever stable ... is a stable one (tädtyeva tädī): 'Stable' means exactly the same (ekasadisatā). The Tathāgata is the same both in gain and loss; fame and obscurity, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain. . . . By this the plane of the stable one (tädibhūmi) has been explained. As he concluded the teaching with these five planes, on each of the five occasions the earth quaked as testimony."

668 I paraphrase Mp's explanation of this verse: "He would not take even one claim of the speculative theorists (dithigatikā)-who are 'self-constrained' (sayasamvutesu) in the sense that they are constrained or blocked by their conceptions-to be categorical or supreme and trust it, believe it, fall back on it as true or false (evam saccam musā vāpi param uttamam katvā na odaheyya, na saddaheyya, na pattiyāyeyya), thinking: 'This alone is true and anything else is false.'" This explanation nicely connects the verse to the prose line, "the Tathāgata did not become subservient to it."

669 Mp identifies the "dart" as the dart of views (dithisalla). Elsewhere craving is spoken of as the dart, for instance, at MN II 258,27 , and SN I 40,7 ; in still other passages, the dart is sorrow, as at 5:48, 5:50.

670 Samvarattham pahānattham virāgattham nirodhattham. These four aims of the spiritual life, it seems, are the reason for including this sutta in the Fours.

671 Mp glosses nibbānogadhagāminam with nibbānassa antogāminam, "leading into nibbāna."

672 All three editions that I consulted have mahantehi, but I prefer the reading in It $\S 35,28,17$, mahattehi, glossed by It-a I 112,25, mahāātumehi ulārajjhāsayehi, "by the great spirits, by those of lofty disposition."

673 The sutta also occurs as It $\S 108,112-13$. My division of the sutta into four parts is hypothetical, but apart from this no fourfold scheme is apparent.

674 Na me te bhikkhave bhikkhū mämaka. Mp. "They are not bhikkhus of mine; they do not belong to me" (te mayham bhikkhū mama santakā na honti).

675 Pütimuttam. There is a belief in traditional ayurvedic medicine
that cow's urine into which gall nuts have been soaked has potent medicinal properties. But Mp says that any urine counts, "for just as a golden-colored body is called a foul body, so even fresh urine is called putrid urine."

676 Disā na patihaññati. Lit. "The region [or quarter] is not hindered." But disā may be a truncated instrumental, with patihaññati referring to the monk. Thus "he is not hindered by [or 'in'] any quarter."

677 Reading with Ce bhikkhuno, as against Be and Ee sikkhato, "one in training."

678 This is one of the most popular discourses in the Theravāda tradition. In Sri Lanka, during the Anurādhapura period, it was often used as the topic for long sermons crowning a festival; see Rahula 1956: 268-73. Mp explains "noble lineages" (ariyavamsā) as the lineages of the noble ones: all Buddhas, paccekabuddhas, and the Buddha's disciples.

679 Mp explains contentment with each requisite by way of the three kinds of contentment. See p. 1600, note 55.

680 Mp : "Finds delight in development (bhāvanārāmo): He delights in developing the four establishments of mindfulness, the four right strivings, the four bases for psychic potency, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven enlightenment factors, the seven contemplations, the eighteen great insights, the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment, and the thirty-eight meditation objects. Finds delight in abandoning (pahānārāmo): He delights in abandoning the defilements of sensual desire and so forth."

681 Reading with Be and Ee dhiram. Ce has viram in pādas a and b, but dhīro in pādas c and d.

682 Mp says that pāda b explains pāda a. Because discontent is unable to vanquish the steadfast one, cannot overcome him, therefore discontent does not vanquish the steadfast one.

683 Dhammapadāni. Mp: "Portions of Dhamma" (dhammakotthāsā).

684 See p. 1646, note 416.

685 These two wanderers are also mentioned at MN 117.37, III 78,13, and SN 22:62, III 73,3. We do not have more information about them than what is said here.

686 Three of the four "wheels" (cakkāni) are mentioned at Sn 260. The fourth, "relying on good persons," corresponds to "associating with the wise" (panditānañca sevanā) at Sn 259.

687 The word sangaha literally means "inclusion, bringing together, holding together," from prefix sam + gaha, "hold, grasp." The verb from which the noun is derived is sangaṇhāti, from sam, "together," and ganhāti, "to grasp, to hold." The four sangahavatthu are means by which one can attract others and sustain a relationship with them characterized by friendliness and respect.

The four in Pāli are dāna, peyyavajja, atthacariyā, samānattatā. To adequately capture the dual nuance of sangaha two words might have been used, "attract and sustain." PED explains sangaha, in the relevant sense, as "kindliness, sympathy, friendliness, assistance, protection, favour," and takes sangahavatthu to mean "objects (characteristics) of sympathy." SED defines the Skt form sangrahavastu as "element of popularity," and BHSD as "article of attraction, means by which a Buddha or (more often in BHS) a Bodhisattva attracts, draws to himself and to religious life, creatures." Although the four figure prominently in the Mahāyāna sütras, they are already found in the archaic Nikāyas.

Mp: "Some people are to be sustained by a gift, so a gift should be given to them. Others expect endearing speech, so they should be addressed with pleasant words. Beneficent conduct is a talk on increasing goodness; these people should be told, 'You should do this, you shouldn't do that. You should associate with this person, not with that person.' Impartiality is being the same in happiness and suffering. This means sitting together with them, living together, and eating together." In Skt versions of the four factors the fourth is often samanartha (which would be Pāli samānattha), "having a common purpose" or "having shared benefits."

688 "Personal existence" (sakkāya): the five aggregates subject to clinging. See MN 44.2, I 299,8-14; SN 22:105; III 158,3-4.

689. Mp: "'For the most part' (yebhuyyena) is said to make an exception of those devas who are noble disciples. Though they experience urgency of knowledge ( $\bar{n} \bar{a} n a s a m v e g a$ ), no fear at all arises in the arahants, because they have attained what should be attained through careful striving. The other devas, as they attend to impermanence, experience both fear as mental fright (cittutrāsabhaya) and, at the time of strong insight, cognitive fear ( $\bar{n} \bar{a} n a b h a y a$ )." "Cognitive fear" is probably the stage of insight called "knowledge of appearance as fearful" (bhayat'upatṭhānañāna; see Vism $645-47$, Ppn 21.29-34).

690 Mp: "Included in personal existence (sakkāyapariyāpannā): included in the five aggregates. Thus, when the Buddha teaches them the Dhamma stamped with the three characteristics, exposing the faults in the round of existence, cognitive fear enters them."

691 Yāvatā bhikkhave dhammā sañkhatā vā asañkhatā vā. In the Nikāyas, the only dhamma explicitly said to be unconditioned is nibbāna. All other dhammas, mental and material, are conditioned. Thus the best of conditioned dhammas is the noble eightfold path, which leads to the unconditioned.

692 Aggassa dātā. It-a II 111,5-7, explains that the dative-genitive aggassa can be understood to denote either the recipient of the
gift or the item to be given: "A giver to the foremost: a giver to the Three Jewels, which are foremost; or one who generates merit by making a lofty gift of a foremost item" (aggassa ratanattayassa dāta, atha va aggassa deyyadhammassa dānaṃ u!̣̄ram katva tattha puñ̃am pavatteta).

693 Mp says that the noble method (ariyañaya) is the path together with insight, and the "goodness of the Dhamma" (kalyanadhammata) and "the wholesomeness of the Dhamma" (kusaladhammata) are names for it.

694 See p. 1647, note 428.

695 This is one of the thirty-two marks of a great person, said to be the karmic consequence of living for the happiness of many, dispelling fear and terror, providing lawful protection and shelter, and supplying all necessities. See DN 30.1.7, III 147-49.

696 Mp interprets the conversation on both sides as referring to the future: the brahmin asks about the Buddha's future rebirth and the latter replies with respect to his future rebirth. As I read the exchange, however, a subtle word play is involved. The brahmin uses the future bhavissati as a polite way of inquiring about the present, which I render "could you be?" (Bhavissanti is used above in just this way, negatively, in the sentence, na vat'imani manussabhütassa padäni bhavissanti, "These could not be....") But the Buddha uses the future form literally and thus in each case answers, "I will not be" (na bhavissami), referring to his destiny in a future life. Two Chinese parallels, SĀ 101 (at T II 28a19-28b17) and EĀ 38.3 (at T II 717 c18-718a12), render this entire conversation as pertaining to the present. The brahmin asks the Buddha whether he is (陃) a deva, a nāga, etc., a human being, or a nonhuman being, and the Buddha simply denies (䒠) that he is any of these. There is no reference to the future.

697 Gandhabbas are celestial beings sometimes depicted as the musicians of the devas. Yakkhas are fierce spirits noted for their destructiveness.

698 The verb abbaje here is optative of abbajati (Skt avrajati). See DOP sv abbajati.

699 Mp : "At the end of the discourse, the brahmin attained three paths and fruits and, in 12,000 phrases, spoke the praise called 'Dona's Thunder.' When a great commotion erupted after the Buddha's passing, he settled it and distributed the relics" (at DN 16.6.25, II 166).

700 That is, I shall terminate the old discomfort of hunger without creating fresh discomfort by eating to excess.

701 I take dhammam here to represent Skt dhammän, the plural accusative. Such usage is not rare in Pāli verse.

702 The verse is identical with Dhp 32.

703 Patilino. Mp glosses with "hidden, gone into solitude" (nilino ekibhāvaṃ upagato).

704 Panunnapaccekasacco. Mp glosses as "view-truths (ditthisaccāni) called 'personal' because each one holds to them individually, insisting 'This alone is truth, this alone is truth."

705 Reading with Be sabbāni nuṇṇāni honti panuṇṇāni honti cattāni vantāni muttāni pahināni, paṭinissaṭthāni. This is also the Ce and Ee reading of the same passage in 10:20.

706 Mp : "The search for a spiritual life (brahmacariyesanā) consists in the aspiration that occurs thus, 'I will seek out, search for, a spiritual life.' This subsides and is tranquilized by the path of arahantship. But the search for a spiritual life in the form of views (ditthibrahmacariyesanā) subsides with the path of streamentry."

707 Bodily activity (kāyasañkhāra) is elsewhere identified with in-andout breathing, which ceases in the fourth jhāna. See 9:31 84. Also see MN 44.15; I 301,19-21; SN 41:6, IV 293,16-17.

708 Mp : "The tight grasp 'Such is the truth' (iti saccaparāmāso) is the grasping of such conceptions as 'Such is the truth, such is the truth.' Viewpoints (ditythiṭthānā) are simply views, called 'swellings' (samussayā) because of their swelling up (samussitattā), because they rise up and persist."

709 Niccadānaṃ anukulayaññam. Mp explains anukulayañãam as a sacrifice that should be made to maintain the family custom, on the grounds that it was given by one's father and grandfather and so forth. On niccadānaṃ anukulayañãam as superior to animal sacrifice, see especially DN 5.22-23, I 144, which can be regarded almost as an elaboration of the present sutta.

710 My division into four sections is speculative. Apart from this, I do not see any other basis for including this sutta among the Fours.

711 These were Vedic sacrifices.

712 I follow Ce and Be, which put niraggalam in pāda b and include mahāyaññā in pāda c. Ee lacks mahāyaññā, but two Chinese parallels include a compound corresponding to this word: SĀ 89 (at T II 22c:9) has 大會, more literally "great gathering," and SĀ ${ }^{2} 89$ (at T II 404bs) has 大祀, where 祀 means "to sacrifice to the gods or ancestors." Mp explains mahārambhā: "With great tasks, great works; further, they are of 'great violence' because of the extent of the destruction of life."

713 Readings of this enigmatic term vary here and elsewhere across the Nikāyas. Here, Ce has vivattacchaddā, Be vivatacchadā, Ee vivattacchada. The expression often occurs in the stock passage on the two courses open to one with the thirty-two bodily marks of a great man: if he remains at home, he will becomela wheel-turning
king, but if he goes forth into homelessness, he will become a perfectly enlightened Buddha, described as "one in the world who vivatacchado" (variants: vivattacchado, vivattacchaddo, vivattacchaddo). See e.g. DN 3.1.5, I 89,8-9; DN 14.1.31, II 16,8-9; DN 30.1.1, III 142,4; MN 91.5, II 134,28; Sn 106. Though the origins of the term and its exact meaning are problematic, the commentaries consistently analyze and explain it in the same way. Since Mp (on the present sutta) does not offer an explanation, I cite the Digha Nikāya commentary, Sv I 250,34-251,3: "Vivattacchado: Here, having been born into the world, he dwells having entirely removed the covering in the world (loke tam chadanam vivattetvā), in the darkness of defilements covered by seven coverings (chadanehi): lust, hatred, delusion, conceit, views, ignorance, and misconduct."

The old canonical commentary, Cūlaniddesa, commenting on Sn 1147, says: "Vivatacchado: There are five coverings (chudanäni): craving, views, defilements, misconduct, ignorance. Those coverings have been removed (vivatāni) by the Blessed Buddha; they have been dispelled, uprooted, abandoned, eradicated, settled, stilled, burned by the fire of knowledge so that they are unable to arise. Therefore the Buddha is one who has removed the coverings" (Nidd II 251,18-22; VRI ed. 204).

Norman (1991: 71-76) had proposed that the Pāli expression was to be derived from the BHS form vighustasabda and thus meant "one whose name (or fame) had rolled in different directions"or "one of widespread fame." In a later work (2006b: 228-29) he changed his position, stating: "although I was correct to see a connection between the Pāli and Skt words, the direction of the development was in the reverse order, and must represent a hyper-Sanskritisation from vivattacchadda." At Sn 372 and elsewhere he renders this "with deceit removed."

The Chinese translators of the Āgamas must have worked with texts that read vighuṣtasabda or some variant with the same meaning. Thus a parallel of 4:40, SĀ 90 (at T II 404cs) has 名間極遠者, "whose name is heard extremely far away." The parallel of DN 30, MĀ 59 (at T I 493b7-8), reads: 必得如來無所著等正覺名稱流布周聞十方; "he necessarily becomes a Tathāgata, unattached (= arahant), fully enlightened, whose name spreads around and is heard in the ten directions." MĀ 161, the parallel of MN 91, has the same at T I 685b2-4. Though various conjectures might be proposed with respect to the original expression and its meaning, given the difficulty of settling these questions across Buddhist textual traditions, the most expedient course open to me is to translate the term as it has been preserved and interpreted in the Pāli tradition.

714 The readings here vary considerably. Ce and Be have vïivattā kulam gatim, "who have transcended family and destination." Ee has a bahubbīhi compound, vïtivattakālamgatī, with still more variants in the notes. Mp (Be) reads kulam gatim in the lemma, but Mp (Ce) has kālam gatim. My rendering follows Ee. Note that in 5:55, at III 69,10, kālam and gatim are in immediate proximity, which supports the hypothesis that here too we should read kāla-/kālam.

715 I read with Be yaññassa kovidā, as against Ce and Ee puñãassa kovidā, "proficient in merit." Mp (Be) and Mp (Ce) show the same difference in their lemmas and glosses. Two Chinese parallels correspond to Be. SĀ'90 (at T II 23a11) has 佛於邪盛善, "the Buddha who is skilled in sacrifice," and SĀ' 90 (at T II 404cs) 諸佛所稱善祀及祀之道, "this is the good sacrifice and the path of sacrifice praised by the Buddhas."

716 The Pāli reads atthi bhikkhave samādhibhāvarā bhāvitā bahulīkatā ditṭhadhammasukhavihārāya samvattati, lit., "there is, bhikkhus, a development of concentration that, when developed and cultivated, leads to dwelling happily in this very life." Since in English "when developed and cultivated" would be redundant, I have omitted it in favor of more natural English diction. The same applies to each of the other three developments of concentration.

717 Evidently, this refers to the attainment of the jhānas either by one who does not use them to develop insight, or by an arahant, who enters the jhānas simply to dwell at easc. Elsewhere the jhānas are shown to lead to the destruction of the taints. Ce has vuccati in this section but not in the parallel sentences of the next three sections. Ee is just the opposite, omitting vuccati here but including it in the next three sections. Be omits vuccati in all four sections.

718 Mp explains "knowledge and vision" in this context as the divine eye (dibbacakkhuñānadassanassa patilābhāya). Elsewhere it is used to mean insight knowledge or even full enlightenment.

719 Yathā divā tathā rattim, yathā rattim tathā divā. Mp: "As he attends to the perception of light by day, so he attends to it at night; and so in reverse."

720 Mp : "How are feelings known as they arise, etc.? Here, a bhikkhu comprehends the base (vathu, the sense organ) and the object (arammana). By comprehending the base and the object, he knows: 'Thus those feelings have arisen; thus they stand; thus they cease.' The same method applies to perceptions and thoughts."

721 Sn 1048, also cited at 3:33.

722 See 3:67 and p. 1654, note 464

723 Also at SN 2:26, I 61-62.

724 Dalhadhammā. The suffix -dhamma here is a Pāli formation of Skt dhanvan, "having a bow." Hence the gloss by Mp: "Firm-bowed means possessing a bow of the maximum size" (dalhadhanu uttamappamānena dhanunā samannāgato).

725 Dhanuggaho sikkhito katahattho katüpāsano. Mp explains dhanuggaho as a teacher of archery, sikkhito as one who has trained in archery for twelve years, katahattho as one skillful enough to split the tip of a hair even at the distance of an usabha, and katūpasāno as one experienced in shooting arrows who has exhibited his craft. See too p. 1831, note 1935; also see CDB 393, note 181, and CDB 819, note 365.

726 Mp: "The teaching of the good is the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment. The teaching of the bad is the sixty-two speculative views."

727 The sutta is also found at SN 21:7, II 280. No fourfold scheme is apparent, and thus I cannot determine the reason for including it in the Fours.

728 I read with Be and Ee nābhāsamānam jānanti, as against Ce na bhāsamānam jānanti. The context clearly requires the former. The Chinese parallel SĀ 1069 (at T II 277c12) supports this with 若不説法者, "If he does not speak the Dhamma."

729 Saññāvipallāso, cittavipallāso, ditṭthivipallāso. Vipallāsa is from $v i+$ pari + āsa, "turned upside down." These are treated in terms of abandonment and non-abandonment at Patis II 80-81.

730 I read with Ce and Be dukkhe bhikkhave sukhan ti saññāvipallāso, as against Ee adukkhe bhikkhave dukkhan ti saññāvipallāso.

731 I read with Ce and Ee micchäditthigatā, as against Be micchäditthihatā. But I follow the verse divisions of Be rather than of Ce .

732 Mp glosses mahikā with himam, "snow," but PED offers "fog, frost," which seem better.

733 Of the four upakkilesas, the drinking of liquor by bhikkhus is prohibited by Pacittiya 51; sexual intercourse by Pārājika 1; the acceptance of gold and silver (as well as of any other medium of monetary exchange) by Nissaggiya-pācittiya 18. Various kinds of wrong livelihood prohibited to Buddhist monastics are enumerated at DN 2.1.21-27, I 67-69. See too MN 117.29, III 75,11-14.

734 I read with Be asuddha sarajā magā.

735 Here, the four streams of merit are explained in terms of the four requisites: robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines. Mp apparently misses the correct derivation of sovaggika, deriving it from sutthu aggānam rūpādinaṃ dāyakā. The word is properly derived from sagga (Skt svarga), heaven. But Mp to 4:61 gives the correct derivation; see p. 1691, note 746.
${ }^{7} 36$ Appamānam cetosamädhin. Mp: "The concentration of the fruit of arahantship" (arahattaphalasamädhi).

${ }^{7} 37$ Also at SN 55:31, V 391, without verses, and at SN 55:41, V 399 400, with the same verses as those of 4:51.

${ }^{7} 38$ These verses are also at SN 11:14, I 232; SN 55:26, V 384; and SN 55:51, V 405.

${ }^{7} 39$ Chava, lit. a corpse. Mp: "Such a person is called a corpse because he or she is dead through the death of their virtuous qualities."

${ }^{7} 40$ On Nakulapitā and Nakulamātā, see 1:257, 1:266, 6:16.

${ }^{7} 41$ At 1:263 she is designated the foremost among givers of what is excellent.

${ }^{7} 42$ Mp identifies the "world-knowers" (lokavidūna) with the Buddhas.

${ }^{7} 43$ Ee is somewhat misleading here. First, it purictuates wrongly, and then it adds an extra paccupatthito hoti at the end. The punctuation in Ce and Be indicates that the indirect object (the item given) belongs with the preceding paccupatthito, and they both lack paccupatthito hoti at the end. Thus in Ce and Be there is no separate phrase indicating that the lay disciple simply serves the Sangha without mention of an item presented.

${ }^{7} 44$ Saha ñātīhi saha upajjhāyehi. In Buddhist monastic culture, the upajjhäya is the senior monk who presides over one's ordination. Thus the use of the word here, in a non-monastic context, is unusual. Mp explains the word in this passage as if it means friends, "because one's friends should be concerned about one's happiness and suffering (sukhadukkhesu upanijjhayitabbattā)," but this explanation depends on an unconvincing word play. Upajjhāya is not connected to the verb upanijjhāyati (Skt upanidhyāyati), "to think of, to consider," but to ajjheti (Skt adhyeti), "to study, to learn from (a teacher)."

${ }^{7} 45$ Ce and Ee āpāthadaso; Be āpātadaso. Mp (Ce): "He sees whatever comes into range, even a subtle matter that comes into range" (tam tam attham āpātheti tameva passati, sukhumampissa atthajātam āpātham āgacchatiyeva ti attho).

${ }^{7} 46$ Here Mp correctly derives sovaggika from sagga: Saggassa hitā ti tatr'upapattijananato sovaggikā.

${ }^{7} 47$ I have divided this verse and the next in line with the corresponding verses of 5:51. Since Ce was edited by different editors who apparently did not collaborate, the same sets of verses in different volumes are sometimes divided differently. The division used at 5:51, which groups together the several applications of wealth, seems to correspond better to the sense.

${ }^{7} 48$ In Pāli: atthisukha, bhogasukha, ananasukha, anavajjasukha. Mp: "The first is the happiness arisen at the thought, There is (atthi, i.e.,
wealth)'; the second is the happiness arisen in one who enjoys wealth; the third is the happiness arisen at the thought, 'I am without debt'; the fourth is the happiness arisen at the thought, 'I am faultless, blameless.'"

749 Reading with Ce and Ee sare, as against Be parami.

750 Reading with Ce and Ee bhāge, as against Be bhoge.

751 Mp : "He divides the types of happiness into two portions. The first three types make up one portion, the happiness of blamelessness is a portion in its own right. Then he sees with wisdom and knows that the former three types of happiness combined are not worth a sixteenth part of the happiness of blamelessness."

752 An expanded parallel of 3:31. Another parallel is.It 106, 109-11.

753 A separate sutta number is missing in Ee, which thus gives the impression that this sutta is a continuation of the preceding one.

754 The first, it seems, are those who place confidence in a spiritual teacher because of his impressive physical form (rūpa), i.e., his beauty. The second are those whose confidence is based on impressive speech (ghosa, perhaps "voice," a soothing and melodious voice); the third, those whose confidence is based on a teacher's austerity (lūkha; Mp gives as examples using a coarse robe and alms bowl); and the fourth, those who place confidence in a teacher because of his teaching (dhamma). Mp says that one out of 100,000 people base their confidence on the teacher's Dhamma.

755 Reading with Be nābhijananti te janā.

756 Reading with Ce mohena adhamā sattā, as against Be mohena āvutā sattā. Ee mohena adhamasattā is the same in meaning as Ce.

757 I read the second couplet with Be and Ee yathädhammā tathāsantā, na tass'evan ti maññare. Ce reads pāda d: nassevanti na maññare. Mp: "In accordance with their own natures: They are of such a nature that qualities like lust, etc., remain; having become of such a nature. [They] do not think of it in such a way: They do not think of it thus: 'We exist in such a way, we have such a nature'" (yathädhammā tathāsantā ti yathā rāgādayo dhammā thitā, tathā sabhāvā'va hutvā; na tass'evàn ti maññare ti mayam evamsantā evamsabhāvā ti tassa na maññare, na maññantī ti attho).

758 The incident is also recorded at Vin II 109-10.

759 Imāni cattāri ahirājakulāni. Mp: "This is said with reference to those [snakes] whose bite is venomous. For all those with a venomous bite are included in these four royal families of snakes."

760 Be formats this declaration as verse, but I follow Ce and Ee in taking it as prose. This is an asseveration of truth (saccakiriya) and, as such, belongs with the verses, but since no meter is apparent, it is unlikely to be actual verse. The asseveration is commonly
recited by forest monks as a safeguard against snakebites. It is often incorporated into their daily recitation.

761 The sutta, including the verse, is also at SN 17:35, II 241, with an added homily on the danger of gain, honor, and praise. See too Vin II 187-88.

762 I cannot clearly see a reason for including this sutta in the Fours. I can only conjecture that the explanation lies in the four groups of people who swerve from righteousness: kings, royal vassals, brahmins and householders, and the people of the town and countryside. But this omits the natural phenomena, which also have a claim to be included.

763 Adhammikā honti. Mp: "Without performing the tenfold oblation prescribed by the ancient kings, and without assigning punishment in proportion to the crime, they perform excessive oblations and assign excessive punishments." The tenfold oblation (dasabhägabali) is mentioned only here.

764 In support of my translation of brähmanagahapatika as a dvanda compound rather than as a kammadhäraya, "brahmin house-

holders," see It-a II 162,7-9: Brähmanagahapatika ti brähmaña c'eva gahapatika ca. Thapetvā brähmane ye keci agāram ajjhāvasanta idha gahapatika ti veditabba.

765 The omission of dubbala in the VRI edition appears to be an error. The other editions, including the Be printed version, have this word.

766 Sce 3:16.

767 Right view (sammädiṭthi) is the first factor of the noble eightfold path, and the three types of wholesome thought are collectively right intention (sammäsankappa), the second path factor.

768 Ee treats this as the beginning of a new sutta, numbered 4:74, whereas Ce and Be consider this part of 4:73. Mp supports Ce and Be , stating that the simile is brought in to give an example of the bad person's character.

769 Ee treats 4:74 and 4:75 as a single sutta, as against Ce and Be , which take them to be different.

770 What occurs from this point on is also in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta, DN 16.6.5, II 154-55.

771 Acinteyyāni. Mp says only "unsuitable to think about" (cintetum ayuttāni).

772 Mp explains the four as follows: "The domain of the Buddhas (buddhavisaya) is the procedure and spiritual might (pavatti ca änubhāvo ca) of the Buddha's qualities such as the omniscient knowledge and so forth. The domain of one in jhāna (jhänavisaya) is the direct knowledges and jhānas. The result of kamma (kammavipaka) is the result of kamma to be experienced in the present life and so forth. Speculation about the world (lokacintā) is such worldly speculations
as: 'Who made the sun and moon? Who made the earth and the ocean? Who created sentient beings? Who made the mountains, mangoes, palmyras, and coconuts?'"

773 Also at MN 142.9-13, III 256-57.

774 Mp: "They do not sit in council (n'eva sabhāyaṃ nisīdati) in the judgment hall for the purpose of passing judgment. They do not engage in business (na kammantam payajeti), in major work such as agriculture, trade, and so forth. They do not go to Kamboja (na kambojaṃ gacchati): they do not go to the Kamboja country for the purpose of carrying goods. This is the mere heading. The sense is that they do not go to any remote country."

775 The sutta, accompanied by similes and verses, is at SN 3:21, I 93-96; see too Pp 51-52. Mp: "One is in darkness (tamo) because one is conjoined with darkness by being reborn in a low family, and one is heading toward darkness (tamoparāyana) because one is approaching the darkness of hell through bodily misconduct, etc. One is in light (joti) because one is conjoined with light by being reborn in a high family, and one is heading toward light (jotiparāyana) because one is approaching the light of a heavenly rebirth through bodily good conduct, etc."

776 See 3:13. I read with Ce and Be venakule vā nesādakule, as against Ee nesādakule vā venakule.

777 Ce defines these four types with exactly the same explanations given in 4:85. Be and Ee, however, offer no explanations but merely give the headings.

778 Mp resolves samanamacalo into samana-acalo, with $-m$ - a mere conjunct consonant. It identifies this figure with the seven kinds of trainees (sattavidhampi sekham dasseti). On the next two ascetics, Mp says: "The white-lotus ascetic (samanapundarīka) is an ascetic similar to a white lotus (puṇdarika), which has fewer than a hundred petals. By this he shows the dry-insight arahant (sukkhavipassakakhīnāsavaṃ dasseti), called a white-lotus ascetic because his virtues are incomplete, since he lacks the jhānas and direct knowledges. The red-lotus ascetic (samanapaduma) is an ascetic similar to a red lotus (paduma), which has a full hundred petals. By this he shows the arahant liberated in both respects (ubhatobhāgavimuttam khīnāsavaṃ dasseti), called a red-lotus ascetic because his virtues are complete, since he possesses the jhānas and direct knowledges." On the colors of the two kinds of lotus flowers, puṇdarīka and paduma, see p. 1642, note 389. "The delicate ascetic among ascetics" (samanesu samanasukhumālo) is "one with soft mind and body, who experiences exclusively pleasure, free from bodily and mental pain" (muducittasariro kāyikacetasikadukkharahito ekantasukhi).

779 Mp: "Macalappatto ti rañño khattiyassa muddhāvasittassa puttabhāvena ceva puttesu jetthakabhāvena ca na tāva abhisittabhāvena ca abhisekappatti-atthāya aculappatto niccalapatto." The gist is that the eldest son is said to have "attained the unshaken" since he is destined to be a head-anointed king. See too p. 1636, note 345.

780 Anutturam yogakkhemaṃ patthayamāno viharati. Mp: "He dwells aspiring for arahantship."

781 Contrary to Mp, the definition of the white-lotus ascetic here is ambiguous; for the expression "he does not dwell having contacted with the body the eight emancipations" (no ca kho attha vimokkhe käyena phusitvā viharati) could mean either: (1) that he does not attain any of the eight emancipations, which would make him a dry-insight arahant (as Mp asserts); or (2) that he attains some of the eight emancipations but not all, perhaps the three emancipations based on form but not the formless attainments and cessation. In such a case, the meditator would conform to the definition of the arahant liberated by wisdom (paññāvimutia) of whom it is said that he has eliminated the taints but does not attain the peaceful formless attainments (MN 70.16, I477,33-478,1). The commentators hold that the paññavimutta arahant can possess any number among the four jhānas or no jhāna at all; only the latter is a dry-insight arahant. The dry-insight arahant (sukkhavipassakakhināsava) is not explicitly mentioned as such in the Nikāyas but first gains recognition in the commentaries. In any case, the difference in the definitions between the wisdom-liberated arahant and the white-lotus arahant suggests that at some point a shift had taken place in the scale of meditative attainments that was expected of an arahant. While the arahant liberated by wisdom lacks only the formless attainments, the white-lotus arahant, on the interpretation offered by the commentators, lacks the jhānas as well.

The eight emancipations (attha vimokkha), defined at 8:66, are not exactly identical with the four jhānas and four formless attainments. It seems that the first three emancipations correspond to the four jhānas but distinguish them in terms of objects rather than mental factors.

782 Again, there is an ambiguity in the definition of the red-lotus ascetic. To qualify as such, does one have to possess all eight emancipations or is it sufficient to possess several? Given the commentarial explanation, which compares the red-lotus ascetic to a lotus with a full hundred petals, it seems that one would have to possess all eight emancipations. But the commentarial definition of the ubhatobhägavimutta arahant allows one who possesses any of the formless attainments to count as "one liberated in both respects." This, too, might represent a lowering of a more
stringent criterion that would restrict the designation to an arahant possessing all eight emancipations.

783 More literally, "the robe he uses is usually one that he has been asked to accept, seldom one that he has not been asked to accept." And so with the other three requisites.

784 In commenting on sannipätikäni; Mp-t says "produced by a combination of the three-bile and so forth-which are out of balance" (pittädīnam tinnampi visamānam sannipātena jātāni). Spk III 81,22-23, commenting on the same word at SN IV 230,29, says "originating through a disturbance of the three, bile and so forth" (tinnampi pittädīnam kopena samutthitāni).

785 The eight causes of feelings are also at SN 36:21, IV 230-31.

786 Mp says that the first section describes the seven kinds of trainees; the second, the dry-insight arahant; the third, the arahant liberated in both respects; and the fourth, the Tathāgata and an arahant similar to the Tathāgata.

787 Mp: "Internal serenity of mind (ajjhattaṃ cetosamatha) is internal concentration of mind at the level of absorption (niyakajjhatte appanācittasamädhi). Higher wisdom of insight into phenomena (adhipaññädhammavipassanā) is the insight knowledge that comprehends conditioned phenomena (sañkhārapariggāhakavipassanā$\tilde{n} \bar{a} n a$ ). This is the higher wisdom that consists of insight into phenomena, that is, into the five aggregates:"

788 Mp: "Conditioned phenomena should be seen as impermanent, explored as impermanent, and discerned with insight as impermanent; and so too as suffering and as non-self."

789 Mp: "The mind should be steadied, composed, unified, and concentrated by way of the first jhāna; and so too for the second and higher jhānas."

790 He repeats all four types, as does the Buddha below. I have omitted the repetition.

791 Abhikkantā h'esā potaliya yadidam tattha tattha kālaññutā. Mp: "It is the nature of the wise, when they have known it is the proper time, to speak dispraise of one who deserves dispraise and to speak praise of one who deserves praise."

792 These are the nine divisions' of the Buddha's teachings. See p. 1678 , note 631.

793 Ee ends 4:104 here, taking this much to be a complete sutta, and then repeats these sentences as the opening of $4: 105$, followed by the exposition. Thus Ee's $4: 105$ is identical with my $4: 104$. Ee reads the uddāna verse to indicate there are two "pools of water" suttas, but the manuscripts have only one. In the verse dve honti can be read with either udakarahadā or ambāni. Ce and Be, which I
follow, choose the latter and thus have only one "pools of water" sutta, $4: 104$, with $4: 106$ left blank.

794 I read with Ce and Be kim nu, as against Ee kathan nu.

795 Pahitatto käyena c'eva paramasaccam sacchikaroti, paññāya ca ativijjha passati. Mp explains "body" as the mental body (nämakāyena), the supreme truth as nibbāna, and wisdom as the wisdom of the path together with insight.

796 The Pāli word thāna can mean place, possibility, occasion, situation, cause, case, etc. Mp glosses it with kārana. To convey the appropriate meaning, I here render it sometimes as "case of a deed" and sometimes simply as "deed."

797 So na bhāyati samparāyikassa maranassa. Mp: "Arahants do not fear death either in the future or in this present life. They alone are intended here. Some, however, say that because of the statement, 'developed right view,' all noble ones from the stream-enterer up are intended." I am not sure that samparāyikassa maranassa means death in a future life, as Mp implicitly understands it. I take it to mean simply "death in the future," referring primarily to one's future in this present life.

798 Attarūpena. Mp glosses: "What is in conformity with oneself, what is suitable, meaning one who desires his welfare" (attano anurūpena anucchavikena, hitakāmenā ti attho).

799 We find three kinds of intoxication (mada) at 3:39: with youth, health, and life. Vibh 345 (Be $\S 832$ ) mentions still more objects of intoxication: birth, clan, gains, honor, respect, wealth, beauty, learning, etc. The elaboration at Vibh 350 (Be 8843-45) connects mada with māna, meaning conceit, and unnati, meaning selfpromotion.

800 Na ca pana samanavacanahetupi gacchati. Mp: "He is not swayed by the words of ascetics holding other doctrines to abandon his own view and take up their view. Here, too, only arahants are intended."

801 Also in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta, DN 16.5.8, II 140-41. The word here translated "inspiring," samvejanīya, is glossed by Mp as samvegajanaka. In this context, the rendering "inspiring a sense of urgency" does not fit. The required sense, rather, is that which inspires faith and devotion.

802 The four places, respectively, are: Lumbini, Bodhgaya, Isipatana (Sarnath), and Kusinārā.

803 What follows is also at 2:1.

804 What follows parallels the passage on "the fault pertaining to the future life" in 2:1, but it describes this simply as "a bad result" (pāpako vipāko) where 2:1 has "a bad, painful result" (pāpako dukkho vipako). Since 2:11 also lacks dukkho, it is possible dukkho was
originally a commentator's gloss on pāpako that made its way into the text of 2:1 itself.

805 Mp : "Among these perils, (1) for one who reflects on the peril in self-reproach, a sense of moral shame is established inwardly. This produces in him restraint in the three doors, and such restraint is the fourfold purified virtuous behavior. Based on this virtuous behavior, he develops insight and attains the highest fruit. (2) For one who reflects on the peril of reproach by others, moral dread is established with respect to the external. This produces in him restraint in the three doors, and such restraint is the fourfold purified virtuous behavior. Based on this virtuous behavior, he develops insight and attains the highest fruit. (4) For one who reflects on the peril of a bad destination, a sense of shame is established with respect to the external. This produces in him restraint in the three doors, and such restraint is the fourfold purified virtuous behavior. Based on this virtuous behavior, he develops insight and attains the highest fruit." The third case does not lead directly to the highest fruit but merely to abstinence from breaches of the five precepts.

806 Also at MN 67.14-20, I 459-62.

807 Pāli recognizes two classes of food items: khädaniya and bhojanīya. The latter comprises rice, porridge, other grains, fish, and meat; the former comprises virtually all other edibles. Hence, corresponding to these two types of foods, two gerundives are used here to designate what may be eaten: khäditabba and bhunjitabba, which I render, respectively, "things that may be consumed" and "things that may be eaten."

808 Mp : "The first jhāna may be of an inferior grade, a middling grade, and a superior grade. For those reborn through an inferior grade, the life span is a third of an eon; for those reborn through the middling grade, the life span is half an eon; and for those reborn through a superior grade, the life span is an eon. This is said with reference to the last." For details on the life spans in the various realms according to the developed Theravāda model, see Vibh 422-26 (Be §§1022-28); CMA 196-99.

809 Mp : "He 'goes to hell' in some subsequent life, insofar as he has not abandoned kamma that leads to hell; not in the sense that he goes there in his immediately following life." According to the Abhidhamma, one passing away from the form realm does not immediately take rebirth in one of the three lower realms; see CMA 226-27.

810 Tasmiṃyeva bhave parinibbāyati. Mp: "He attains final nibbāna while remaining in that same form-realm existence; he does not descend lower."

811 See pp. 1671-72, note 581.

812 The devas of streaming radiance (devā äbhassarā) are the highest class of devas associated with the second jhāna. Mp: "The second jhāna is threefold, as stated above [for the first jhāna]. For those reborn by a superior grade, the life span is eight eons; by a middling grade, four eons; and by an inferior grade, two eons. The text refers to the last."

813 The devas of refulgent glory (devā subhakinhā) are the highest class of devas associated with the third jhāna. According to the Abhidhamma system, the life spans of the three planes corresponding to the third jhāna are respectively sixteen, thirty-two, and sixty-four eons. Since this is contradicted by the sutta, Mp explains that what is intended here is the lowest plane among those planes reached by rebirth through attainment of the third jhāna. However, according to Mp, the devas of refulgent glory are actually the highest among these realms, with a life span of sixty-four eons. There thus seems to be a contradiction between the sutta and the systematic Theravāda determination of life spans.

814 These are the devā vehapphalā, the sole realm of rebirth corresponding to the mundane fourth jhāna. This figure is in agreement with the stipulation of the Abhidhamma.

815 Te dhamme aniccato dukkhato rogato gaṇdato sallato aghato ābādhato parato palokato suññato anattato samanupassati. Mp: "Of these eleven terms, two-impermanent and disintegrating-signify the characteristic of impermanence. Two-empty and non-selfsignify the characteristic of non-self. The rest signify the characteristic of suffering. By ascribing the three characteristics to the five aggregates and seeing them thus, he achieves three paths and fruits. Having developed the fourth jhāna, firm in it, 'he is reborn in companionship with the devas of the pure abodes.'"

816 The pure abodes (suddhāvāsā) are five planes of existence in the form realm into which only non-returners can be reborn. Nonreturners attain arahantship there without ever returning to lower realms. See CMA 192-93.

817 In this sutta, loving-kindness is correlated with the first jhāna, compassion with the second, altruistic joy with the third, and equanimity with the fourth. According to the developed Theravāda system, however, any of the first three immeasurable meditations can lead to all three jhānas, excluding the fourth; only immeasurable equanimity can lead to the fourth jhāna. See Vism 322,5-12, Ppn 9.111.

818 For various wonders occurring at the bodhisatta's conception and birth, see too MN 123.

819 Mp: "Between every three world systems there is one world interval, which is like the space in the middle of three cart
wheels or petals placed so that they touch one another. This world-interval hell (lokantarikanirayo) measures eight thousand yojanas in size."

820 Mp: "Those beings who have been reborn there: Through what kamma have those beings been reborn in the world-interval hell? They arise there because they have committed terrible crimes against their parents and against righteous ascetics and brahmins, and through other violent deeds such as killing living beings day after day.... Their bodies are three gavutas long (appx. five miles) and they have long fingernails like bats. As bats hang in trees, these beings hang by their fingernails on the foot of the world-system-mountain. When creeping along, they stay in arm's length of one another. Then, thinking, 'We have gained food,' they bustle around, roll over, and fall into the water that supports the world; they are just like honey fruits which, when struck by the wind, break off and fall into the water. As soon as they have fallen, they dissolve like a lump of flour in extremely caustic water. ... This radiance [when the bodhisatta enters his mother's womb] does not even last long enough to take a sip of porridge, but only long enough for them to awaken from sleep and cognize the object. But the Digha Nikāya reciters say that, like a flash of lightning, it shows forth merely for the time of a finger snap and disappears even while they are saying, 'What is that?"

821 Alaya. Mp explains this narrowly as the five objects of sensual pleasure, or more broadly, as the entire round of samsāra.

822 Anälaye dhamme. Mp: "The noble Dhamma opposed to attachment, based on the ending of the round."

823 Anupasama. Lit., "lack of peace."

824 Avijjāgatā, bhikkhave, pajā andabhūtā pariyonaddhā. This is the reading in Ce and Be, but Ee has andhabhūtā, "become blind." The latter, at first glance, seems more likely to have been original, but the simile of the hen at 8:11, IV 176,15-16 supports andabhūtā, "become an egg." Mp too accepts this reading with its gloss, "being enveloped by the shell of ignorance, it has become like an egg" (avijjandakosèna pariyonaddhattā andam viya bhūtā ti andabhūtā).

825 Also at DN 16.5.16, II 145-46.

826 In Pāli, the three kinds of fetters are, respectively: orambhāgiyāni samyojanāni, upapattipatiläbhiyāni samyojanāni, bhavapaṭiläbhiyāni samyojanāni. Mp distinguishes the last two thus: the "fetters for obtaining rebirth" are those by which one obtains the next rebirth (yehi anantarā upapattim pațilabhati); the "fetters for obtaining existence" are the conditions for obtaining rebirth-existence
(upapattibhavassa paṭiläbhāya paccayāni). Apparently the difference, from the commentary's point of view, is that the former bind one only to the immediately following rebirth while the latter bind one to successive rebirths. But see note 829 below for an alternative interpretation.

827 Since the stream-enterer, too, has not abandoned any of these fetters, Mp explains: "The once-returner is mentioned to show the highest among the noble ones who have not abandoned any of the fetters." Mp-ṭ: "That is, who have not abandoned the lower fetters. For above the once-returner, there is no noble one who has not abandoned the lower fetters. But isn't it the case that once-returners have abandoned [some] lower fetters, for they have abandoned the fetters of views, doubt, and wrong grasp of rules and observances? In that case, why is it said that they have not abandoned the lower fetters? Because once-returners have not abandoned the fetters of sensual lust and ill will; therefore the statement that they have not abandoned the lower fetters is said with reference to those fetters that they have not abandoned. It does not mean that they have not abandoned any fetters."

828 Uddhaṃsotassa akanitthagāinino puggalassa. This refers to the most sluggish of the five classes of non-returners, who proceed upward through successive pure abodes to the highest one, called Akaniṭ̣ha. This type, too, is mentioned to show the coarsest who still retain the fetters of rebirth, but more acute classes of non-returners also retain these fetters.

829 This statement creates a predicament for the traditional Theravādin interpretation of the five types of non-returners, which is based on Pp 16-17 and its commentary at Pp-a 198-201. The core of this interpretation is the rejection of an intermediate state (antarabhava) between two lives. Such rejection thus entails the need to interpret the antara parinibbāy $\bar{\imath}$ as a non-returner who attains arahantship during the first half of the life span in the next existence. However, the word antarāparinibbāy $\bar{\imath}$ literally means "one who attains final nibbāna in between," and there seems no legitimate reason, based on a sutta, to deny the possibility that certain non-returners, following their death in human form, enter an intermediate state and attain final nibbāna in that state itself, thereby circumventing the need to take another rebirth. This seems to be the purport of the present text, according to which the antarāparinibbāy $\bar{\imath}$ has abandoned the fetters of rebirth but not the fetters of existence. Upon attaining arahantship, the antarāparinibbāy $\bar{\imath}$ will also abandon the fetters of existence. I have discussed the five types of non-returners in detail in CDB 1902-3,
note 65. For further discussion, see p. 1782, notes 1535-38; for additional textual analysis, see Harvey 1995: 98-108.

830 Yuttappatibhāno no muttappatibhāno. Mp: "When answering a question, he answers correctly (yuttameva), but he does not answer quickly (sigham pana na katheti). The meaning is that he answers slowly. This method [of explanation] should be applied to all the cases." Pp 42 (Be §152) defines this person in the same sense thus: "A person who, being asked a question, speaks correctly but not quickly is called one whose discernment is incisive but not free-flowing" (idh'ekacco puggalo pañham puttho samāno yuttam vadati no sigham, ayam vuccati puggalo yuttappatibhāno no muttappatibhāno).

831 The four alternatives are: ugghatitaññ $\bar{u}$, vipacitañ $\bar{n} \bar{u}$ (so Ce and Ee; Be vipañcitaññū), neyyo, padaparamo. The difference in reading of the second person would yield a choice between "one who understands when ripened" (based on Ce and Ee) and "one who understands when elaborated" (based on Be). Be's reading seems to me to agree better with the formal definition of this type in other sources. I cite here the definitions at Pp 41 (Be §§148-51) with commentarial clarifications at Pp-a 223: (1) "The person of quick understanding is one for whom the breakthrough to the Dhamma (dhammäbhisamaya) occurs together with an utterance. (Pp-a: Ugghatita means the opening up of knowledge (ñāngghātana); the meaning is that one knows as soon as knowledge opens up. Together with an utterance: as soon as [a statement on Dhamma] is uttered. The breakthrough occurs together with knowledge of the Dhamma of the four truths.)" (2) "The person who understands through elaboration is one for whom the breakthrough to the Dhamma occurs when the meaning of what has been stated briefly is being analyzed in detail. (Pp-a: This is the person able to attain arahantship when, after a concise outline of the teaching has been set up, the meaning is being analyzed in detail.)" (3) "The person to be guided is one for whom the breakthrough to the Dhamma occurs gradually, through instruction, questioning, careful attention, and reliance on good friends." (4) "One for whom the word is the maximum is one who-though hearing much, reciting much, retaining much in mind, and teaching much-does not reach the breakthrough to the Dhamma in that life."

Nett 125 (Be §88) correlates these four types with the four kinds of practice (see 4:161-62): the ugghatitaññū puggala with one emancipated by pleasant practice and quick direct knowledge, the vipañcitaññū puggala with one emancipated by either painful practice and quick direct knowledge or by pleasant practice
and sluggish direct knowledge, and the neyya puggala with one emancipated by painful practice and sluggish direct knowledge. The padaparama puggala is not emancipated and thus the four alternatives do not apply.

832 Mp: "One who lives off the fruit of his effort but not off the fruit of his kamma: This is one who passes the day energetically exerting himself and lives off whatever he gains as the consequential fruit of this, but does not obtain any meritorious fruits as a result of his exertion. One who lives off the fruit of his kamma but not off the fruit of his effort: These are all the devas, from [the heaven of] the four great kings up, who live off their meritorious fruits without energetically exerting themselves. One who lives off the fruit of both his effort and his kamma: These are kings and royal ministers, etc. One who lives off the fruit of neither his effort nor his kamma: These are the beings in hell. In this sutta, by 'fruit of kamma,' only meritorious fruit is intended."

833 Mp : "The first is the blind foolish worldling; the second is the worldling who intermittently does wholesome deeds; the third is the stream-enterer, the once-returner, and the non-returner; and the fourth is the arahant."

834 Mp : "The first is the multitude of worldly people; the second is the dry-insight stream-enterer and once-returner; and the third is the non-returner. Since the dry-insight meditator does obtain momentary jhāna arisen on the basis of his object (tankhanikampi upapattinimittakam jhānam patilabhati yeva), he too fulfills concentration. The fourth is the arahant. The following sutta should be understood by the method stated here."

835 On the four analytical knowledges (patisambhidā), see below note 875.

836 Here and in the next sutta I read with Ce and Ee samatho, as against Be sammasana.

837 The usual list of faculties (indriya) and powers (bala) is fivefold, with wisdom (pañ $\tilde{\bar{a}}$ ) as the fifth. For definitions of the five faculties, see SN 48:9-10. For the five powers, see 5:14.

838 Cattāri kappassa asankheyyāni. Despite the word "incalculable" (Ce and Ee asankheyya; Be asankhyeyya), the length of this period is finite. For similes illustrating the length of an eon-said to be too difficult to express in numbers-see SN 15:5-6, II 181-82. And for the number of eons that have "elapsed and gone by," see SN 15:7-8, II 182-84.

839 Mp explains that there are three ways the dissolution of an eon takes place: by water, fire, and wind. When the eon is destroyed by fire, it is consumed up to the devas of streaming radiance. When it is destroyed by water, it is dissolved up to the devas of
refulgent glory. When it is destroyed by wind, it disintegrates up to the devas of great fruit.

840 Mp : "He is not content with the four requisites by way of the three kinds of contentment." See p. 1600, note 55.

841 Mp says the word "cunningly" (sankhāya, lit. "having calculated") indicates that he tries to make a false impression on families (for the purpose of receiving offerings). The last phrase is perhaps similar in nuance to a well-known English slang expression.

842 Ee reads here: gambhīresu ...thānatthānesu, which might be translated "various deep matters." It could be that thanatthānesu was the more original reading, which was altered to thanatthānesu under the influence of this more common expression. But since Mp comments as if the latter were the reading, it is clear that thanatthānesu goes back at least to the age of the commentator. At MN 115.12-19, III 64-67, the Buddha explains how a bhikkhu is "skilled in what is possible and impossible" (thānathānakusalo).

843 It is puzzling that Ānanda goes unaccompanied to visit the bhikkhuni. Almost always when a bhikkhu goes to visit a layperson, even a male, he brings another monk along. In a Chinese parallel of this sutta, SĀ 564 (T II 148a13-148c10), as Ānanda approaches, the bhikkhuni sees him in the distance and exposes her body. When Ānanda sees her exposed, he restrains his senses and turns away. The nun then feels ashamed and puts on her clothes. She offers Ānanda a seat, pays homage to him, and sits down to one side. Apart from this circumstantial difference, Ānanda's discourse in the Chinese version is almost exactly as in the Pāli version.

844 Setughäto vutto bhagavatā. Mp: "The demolition of the bridge (setughātam): the demolition of the state and the demolition of its condition (padaghātam paccayaghātam)." The expression is also in 3:74. See p. 1660, note 497.

845 Mp : "Based on the present nutriment of edible food, using it carefully, he abandons the nutriment consisting in past kamma; but the craving for present edible food should be abandoned."

846 The Chinese version reads: "Sister, by not indulging it, one abandons and severs sexual desire, the connecting bridge (和合橋梁)." It seems that setughäto must have been an idiom meaning that any connection with a particular state should be destroyed. Mp says that when Ānanda reached the end of the discourse, the bhikkhuni's passion for him had vanished.

847 Sugata. Lit., "Well-Gone." One of the most common epithets of the Buddha, occasionally also used for arahant disciples.

848 Bhikkhū duggahitam suttantam pariyäpunanti dunnikkhittehi padabyañjanehi. See 2:20. I follow Brahmāli's suggestion that suttantam
here has an implicitly plural sense; for other examples, see Vin III 159,12, and Vin IV 344,21.

849 Ce is missing the uddāna verse at the end of this vagga. Hence I base the titles on Be.

850 In Pāli:dukkhā patipadā dandhābhiññā, dukkhā patipadā khippābhiñña, sukhā patipadā dandhābhiñña, sukhā patipadā khippäbhiñña.

851 Anantariyam pāpunāti āsavānam khayāya. The word anantariya is of rare occurrence, so its meaning must be determined inferentially. One clue is the Ratana Sutta, which says: yam buddhasettho parivannayī suciṃ samādhim ānantarikaññam āhu (Sn 226). Any difference between anantarika and ānantariya is insignificant, as the terminations -iya and -ika are often interchangeable. Another clue is SN 22:81, at III 96-99, where the Buddha addresses the question: "How should one know and see to attain immediately (lit. 'without interval') the destruction of the taints?" (evam ... jānato evam passato anantara āsavānam khayo hoti). Other AN sut-tas-3:102, I 158,7-12, and 5:23, III 16,29-17,2-speak about the mind being "properly concentrated for the destruction of the taints" (sammā samādhiyati āsavānam khayāya). See too, 5:170, III 202,27-33, which speaks about certain conditions "such that immediately afterward the destruction of the taints occurs" (anantara āsavānam khayo hoti). Thus, the "immediacy condition" spoken of here seems to be a state in which the mind is properly concentrated and, at the same time, has acquired the insight that brings about the destruction of the taints. Mp explains anantariya with reference to the Abhidhamma concept of an immediate succession between path and fruit: "The 'immediacy condition' is the concentration of the path, which immediately yields its result (anantaravipākadāyakaṃ maggasamädhim)." Though the suttas do not employ the scheme of the cognitive process that underlies the concept of path and fruition moments, the expression "immediacy condition" does suggest a state of complete ripeness for the breakthrough to arahantship.

852 The trainee powers (sekhabalāni), defined at 5:2, partly differ from the five powers included among the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment.

853 Here, sameti, "calms [it] down," is an addition to the usual formula, intended to subsume this discipline under "the calming practice."

854 Mp says that for Moggallāna, the first three paths were achieved by pleasant practice and sluggish direct knowledge, but the path of arahantship was won by pleasant practice and quick direct knowledge. In 7:61 it is seen that Moggallāna often had to struggle with drowsiness in his practice for arahantship. He
often regressed and needed the help of the Buddha to progress further, as shown in SN 40:1-9, IV 262-69.

855 In this sutta the phrase käyassa bhedā, "with the breakup of the body," is not followed by param maranä, "after death," as it normally is. The omission seems deliberate. Perhaps the purpose is to indicate that the person being described can attain nibbāna at the very moment of death, without having to continue on to another existence.

856 According to this sutta, the distinction between the use of repugnant objects and the jhānas determines whether one attains nibbāna through exertion (sasañkhāraparinibbāyī) or without exertion (asañkhāraparinibbāyī). The distinction between prominent faculties and feeble faculties determines whether one attains nibbāna in this very life (dittth'eva dhamme) or with the breakup of the body (käyassa bhedā), Mp says that the first and second persons are dry-insight meditators (sukkhavipassaka) who attend to conditioned phenomena as their meditation object (sañkhāranimittam upaṭthapentti). Sasañkhārena is glossed with sappayogena, which supports my rendering "through exertion." The third and fourth persons are those who take serenity as their vehicle (samathayänikā).

857 With Ce and Be I read maggehi, as against Ee añgehi. The latter is likely to be an editorial error. Though Mp does not provide a gloss here, the passage is cited at Paṭis II 92,9, and commented on at Paṭis-a III 584,24-25, in a way that requires maggehi: Catühi maggehī ti upari vuccamānehi catūhi pațipadāmaggehi, na ariyamaggehi ("By four paths: by the four paths of practice spoken about below, not by the noble paths").

858 Mp explains this as the first world-transcending path, but Mp-t says; "This is said with reference to the path of streamentry (sotāpattimagga), but the meaning of this passage can be understand simply by way of the mundane [preparatory] path" (lokiyamaggavasen'eva).

859 Mp and Mp-t, read together, say that because there is no development and cultivation of the world-transcending path, which lasts for only one mind-moment, he develops and cultivates the preparatory mundane path (pubbabhägiyo lokiyamaggo) for the purpose of attaining the higher world-transcending paths. Then the fetters are abandoned and the underlying tendencies are uprooted by the successive paths (maggappatipätiya pahīyanti byantīhonti).

860 Mp : "This is a person who naturally gains insight. Based on insight, he produces concentration."

861 Yuganaddham bhāveti. Mp says that each time he attains a
meditative attainment (samäpatti), he explores it by way of its conditioned phenomena. And having explored its conditioned phenomena, he enters the next attainment. Thus, having attained the first jhāna, he emerges and explores its conditioned phenomena as impermanent, etc. Then he enters the second jhāna, emerges, and explores its conditioned phenomena, and so or up to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. Since however, yuganaddha means literally "yoked together," some interpret the term to mean that in this mode of practice serenity and insight occur simultaneously. The commentarial system does not acknowledge this possibility but several suttas might be read as suggesting that insight can occur within the jhāna and does not require the meditator to withdraw before beginning contemplation. In AN, see in particular 9:36; see too MN 52.4-14, I 350-52; MN 64.9-15, I 435-37.

862 The readings vary: Ee has dhammuddhaccaviggahttamanā; the termination-manā is suspicious. Be has -viggahitam mänasam. Ce has -viggahitam manam. While manā and mänasam can both be translated as "mind," manam normally means "conceit." The Sinhala translation seems to support this by rendering manam as adhimānaya (Pāli adhimana), "overestimation of oneself," but to speak of "conceit"-as opposed to "mind"-as being "grasped by restlessness" does not make good sense. Mp glosses the term without specifying the subject: "Grasped, thoroughly grasped, by restlessness, which consists of the ten corruptions of insight (dasa vipassan'upakkilesā; see Vism 633-38, Ppn 20.105-28) in regard to the dhammas of serenity and insight." Nothing in the text itself suggests the corruptions of insight are involved. I understand the person being described here as a practitioner who reflects deeply on the Dhamma, acquires a sense of urgency, and then finally settles down and gains insight when meeting with favorable supporting conditions. In the next sentence of the text, the word rendered "mind" is cittam.

863 The first part of this sutta, up to the section on the four acquisitions of individuality, is also at SN 12:25, II 39-41, but addressed to Ānanda.

864 Mp explains this with reference to the Abhidhamma scheme of cittas, types of consciousness; see CMA 32-40, 46-64. I summarize Mp's explanation: Bodily volition is of twenty kinds by way of the eight kinds of sense-sphere wholesome cittas and twelve kinds of unwholesome cittas. So too for verbal volition. But mental volition includes these as well as the nine kinds of sublime (mahaggata) volition, namely, volition associated with the five jhānas of the Abhidhamma system and the four formless attainments.

Because of bodily volition, there arises pleasure conditioned by the eight kinds of wholesome kamma, and pain conditioned by the twelve kinds of unwholesome kamma, that is, the kamma generated in the corresponding active types of consciousness. So too for the other two doors. Ignorance is a condition (avijjāpaccayā va) because, there being ignorance, volition occurs in the three doors as a condition for pleasure and pain. Thus this sutta statement refers to ignorance as the root cause. Pleasure and pain arise "internally" (ajjhattam) when they arise in oneself. The word seems to underscore the retributive aspect of kamma.

865. Mp: "One acts on one's own (sämam) when one initiates the action without instigation from others. One instigates activity because of others when others encourage or command one to act. One acts with clear comprehension (sampajäno) when one knows the wholesome and unwholesome as such, and their respective results as such. If one does not understand this, one acts without clear comprehension."

866 Imiesu bhikkhave dhammesu avijjä anupatitä. Mp: "Ignorance is comprised in the volitional states analyzed above, functioning both as a coexistent condition and as a decisive-support condition (sahajätavasena ca upanissayavasena ca). Thus the round of existence and its root, ignorance, are shown."

867 Mp: "Arahants are seen acting with the body. They sweep the courtyard of the shrine and the bodhi tree, go out and return, do various duties, etc., but in their case the twenty volitions occurring at the bodily door no longer produce kammic results (avipäkadhammatam äpajjanti). Here, it is the volition that occurs at the body door that is intended by the word 'body.' The same method applies to the other two." Mp-t: "When arahants perform actions, how is it that they create no bodily or other kinds of kamma? In the sense that these deeds do not bear results, for an action done by an arahant is neither wholesome nor unwholesome but a mere activity (kiriyamatta) that does not yield results."

868 Mp: "'Field,' etc., are names for wholesome and unwholesome kamma. For that is a field (khetta) in the sense of a place where results grow; a site (vatthu) in the sense of their foundation; a base (ayatana) in the sense of a cause; a location (adhikarana) in the sense of a locale."

869 In Ee this sentence marks the beginning of a new sutta, and thus at this point Ee's numbering exceeds mine by one. Both Ce and Be , in accord with Mp , treat the previous passage and this one as a single sutta. While this paragraph certainly looks like the beginning of an independent sutta, and perhaps originally was, Mp takes it to be continuous with the analysis of volition
stated above. It says that up to this point the Buddha has shown the kamma accumulated in the three doors; now he shows the places where that kamma ripens. "Acquisition of individuality" (attabhāvappatiläbha) is an individual existence, the combination of body and mind that constitutes a particular life.

870 Mp identifies these beings as the devas corrupted by play (khiddāpadosikā devā). While they are enjoying celestial delights in their heavenly realm, they sometimes forget to eat and drink, and because they miss a meal they wither away like a garland placed in the sun. See Bodhi 2007: 159-60.

871 Mp says these are the devas corrupted by mind (manopadosika devā), who dwell in the realm of the four great kings. When they become angry at one another, their mutual anger becomes the cause for both to pass away. See Bodhi 2007: 160-61.

872 Mp says that these are human beings. For people kill themselves and others kill them. Thus they perish either on account of their own volition or because of the volition of others.

873 Mp: "[Question:] Why does Sāriputta pose this question? Isn't he able to answer it himself? [Reply:] He is able, but he does not speak because he thinks, 'This question is in the domain of a Buddha.'"

874 Mp: "The former, who come back to this state of being (āgantāro itthattam), are those who return to the five aggregates in the sense sphere; they are not reborn there [in the realm where they pass away] or in a higher realm. Those who do not come back to this state of being (anägantāro itthattam) do not return to the five aggregates or take a lower rebirth. They are either reborn there [in the realm where they pass away] or in a higher realm, or they attain final nibbāna right there. When it is said that they are reborn in a higher realm, this is said in the case of those who had been born in a lower existence. But from the realm of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, there is no rebirth into a higher realm."

875 Odhiso vyañjanaso. Mp glosses these two words respectively with karanaso akkharaso, "by way of reasons [or cases], by way of the letter." The meaning is not entirely clear to me and Mp-t does not elaborate. The patisambhidās are explained a Vism 440-43, Ppn 14.21-31, on the basis of Vibh 292-94 (Be 88718-24), which analyzes them from several angles. Briefly: Knowledge of meaning is analytical knowledge of meaning (atthäpatiisambhidā); knowledge of Dhamma is analytical knowledge of Dhamma (dhammapatisambhidā); knowledge of how to express and articulate the Dhamma is analytical knowledge of language (niruttipatisambhidā); and knowledge about knowledges is analytical knowledge of discernment (paṭibhānapatisambhidā). This
last analytical knowledge seems to refer to the ability to spontaneously apply the other three types of knowledge to clearly communicate the Dhamma. From a more philosophical perspective, attha is considered the result of a cause (hetuphala) and dhamma a cause (hetu) producing an effect. Therefore the analytical knowledge of meaning is correlated with knowledge of the first and third noble truths, analytical knowledge of Dhamma with knowledge of the second and fourth noble truths. Analytical knowledge of meaning is knowledge of each factor of dependent origination in its role as an effect arisen from a condition, and analytical knowledge of Dhamma is knowledge of the same factor in its role as a condition giving rise to an effect.

876. Ee's pakäsemi, as the third verb, is not in Ce or Be. Pakāseti is also absent in the same sequence of verbs at 3:136, I 286,9-10, also in Ee.

877. The text is cryptic here and may have become garbled in the course of transmission. Mp supplies a verb to the first part of the sentence, upagacchatu, which I include and translate in brackets. Mp fills out aham veyyäkaranena with ahämassa pañhakathanena cittam ärädhessämi ("I will satisfy his mind by answering the question"). I have also added this in brackets.

878 Mp: "Our teacher, who is highly skilled in these things that have been attained by us, is present. If I had not realized the analytical knowledge of meaning, he would dismiss me, telling me to first realize it.' Even while sitting in front of the teacher, he roars a lion's roar."

879 The dialogue here seems to be concerned with the "ontological status" of the arahant who has attained the nibbāna element without residue remaining, that is, with the question whether the liberated person exists or does not exist after death.

880 Mp glosses mä h'evam with evam mä bhami, "Do not speak thus," and explains that the four questions are asked by way of eternalism, annihilationism, partial eternalism, and "eel-wriggling" (sassāta-uccheda-ekaccasassata-amarāvikkhepa). Thus Sāriputta rejects each question. "Eel-wriggling" is agnosticism, skepticism, or intellectual evasiveness.

881 Appapañcam papañceti. Mp: "He creates proliferation [or speculations] in relation to something that should not be proliferated [or speculated about]. He travels along a path that one should not travel on." The Pāli word papañca suggests mental fabrication, obsessive mental construction, and deluded conceptualization, which the commentaries say arise from craving, conceit, and wrong views (tanhā, māna, ditthi). It seems to me that Mp understands appapañcam as a contraction of appapañciyam. A Chinese parallel, SĀ 249, says at T II 60a16-20: "If one [makes any of these
assertions about the six bases for contact], these are just empty words (此則虛言). With the vanishing, fading away, cessation, and stilling of the six bases for contact, one relinquishes empty falsehood (雕諸虛偽) and attains nibbāna."

882 Tāvatā papañcassa gati. Mp: "As far as the range of the six bases extends, just so far extends the range of proliferation, distinguished by way of craving, views, and conceit."

883 Ee treats this sutta as a continuation of the preceding one, without counting it separately. Thus at this point Ee's numbering catches up with Ce and Be .

884 The dialogue, according to Mp , refers to making an end to samsāra, the entire round of suffering (vattadukkhassa antakaro hoti, sakalam vattadukkham paricchinnam parivatumam katva titthati).

885 Caranasampanno yathäbhūtam jānāti passati. Yathābhūtam jānam passam antakaro hoti. This differs from the previous assertion (that one cannot become an end-maker by means of knowledge and conduct) in its emphasis on knowing and seeing (as well as conduct) as active functions rather than subjective possessions tinged with clinging.

886 This sutta merges 2:130-33.

887 Much of this is also in MN 62.8-11, I 421-23. See too MN 28 and MN 140, which treat the topic more elaborately.

888 Ee's paññāya cittam viräjeti is clearly wrong. In each of the four paragraphs, paññāya here should be replaced by the name of the element.

889 Sakkäyanirodham. Mp: "The cessation of personal existence, that is, the round of existence with its three realms; the meaning is nibbāna."

890 These are explained at Vibh 330-31 (Be 8799), though in terms of wisdom (paññā). I quote only the text on the first jhāna: "When perception and attention are accompanied by sensuality in one who attains the first jhāna, wisdom pertains to deterioration; when mindfulness is stabilized in accordance with its nature, wisdom pertains to stabilization; when perception and attention are unaccompanied by thought, wisdom pertains to distinction. When perception and attention are accompanied by disenchantment, conjoined with dispassion, wisdom pertains to penetration" (pathamassa jhānassa lābhim kāmasahagatā saññāmanasikārā samudācaranti hänabhāginī paññā; tadanudhammatā sati santitthati thitibhāginī paññā; avitakkasahagatā saññāmanasikārā samudācaranti visesabhāginī paññā; nibbidāsahagatā saññāmanasikārā samudācaranti virāgupasaṃhitā nibbedhabhāginī paññā). Similar distinctions are made for each of the higher attainments.

891 This passagie is also included in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta, DN 16.4.7, at II 124-26.

892 Mahāpadese. Mp glosses as mahā-okāse (apparently as if the compound could be resolved mahā + padese) and as mahā-apadese, the latter explained as "great reasons stated with reference to such great ones as the Buddha and others" (buddhādayo mahante mahante apadisitva vuttāni mahākāranāni). This second resolution is certainly to be preferred. DOP gives, among the meanings of apadesa, "designation, pointing out, reference, witness, authority." Cattāro mahāpadesā is sometimes rendered "four great authorities" but the sutta actually specifies only two authorities, the suttas and the Vinaya. Walshe, in LDB, renders it as "four criteria." I understand the term to mean "four great references," the four provenances of a teaching.

893 Tāni padabyañjanāni...sutté otāretabbāni vinaj̇e sandassetabbāni. Mp gives various meanings of sutte and vinaye here, some improbable. Clearly, this instruction presupposes that there already existed a body of discourses and a systematic Vinaya that could be used to evaluate other texts proposed for inclusion as authentic utterances of the Buddha. Otāretabbāni is gerundive plural of otärenti, "make descend, put down or put into," and otaranti, just below, means "descend, come down, go into." My renderings, respectively, as "check for them" and "are included among" are adapted to the context. Sandassetabbāni is gerundive plural of sandassenti, "show, make seen," and sandissanti means "are seen."

894 The clearer of the two Chinese parallels is in DĀ 2, at T I 17b2918a22. Here cattāro mahāpadesā is rendered 四大教法, "four great teaching dhammas." I translate the first declaration (T I 17c2-13) as follows: "If there is a bhikkhu who claims: 'Venerable ones, in that village, city, country, I personally heard [this] from the Buddha, I personally received this teaching,' you should not disbelieve what you hear from him, nor should you reject it, but through the suttas determine whether it is true or false; based on the Vinaya, based on the Dhamma, probe it thoroughly. If what he says is not the sutta, not the Vinaya, not the Dhamma, then you should say to him: 'The Buddha did not say this. What you have received is mistaken! [Or: You have received it erroneously!] For what reason? Because based on the suttas, based on the Vinaya, based on the Dhamma, we [find] that what you said deviates from the Dhamma. Venerable one, you should not uphold this, you should not report it to people, but should discard it.' But if what he says is based on the suttas, based on the Vinaya, based on the Dhamma, then you should say to him: 'What you said was truly spoken by the Buddha. For what
reason? Because based on the suttas, based on the Vinaya, based on the Dhamma, we [find] that what you said accords with the Dhamma. Venerable one, you should uphold this, you should widely report it to people; you should not discard it.' This is the first great teaching dhamma."

895 I follow Ce and Ee here. Be differs and would be translated: "But if, when one does not speak about what one has seen, wholesome qualities decline and unwholesome qualities increase, I say that one should speak about what one has seen." Each of the following paragraphs varies in the same way.

896 Näham kvacana, kassaci kiñcanatasmim, na ca mama kvacana, katthaci kiñcanatatthi. At 3:70, I 206,18-20, this formula is said to have been used by the Niganthas to cultivate non-possessiveness. I follow the reading in Ce. Be is almost the same, except that it has kvacani twice in place of kvacana. Ee at the end reads kiñcanam n'atthi rather than kiñcanat'atthi or kiñcanatatthi. This reading is also found in older Sinhala-script editions, and in the Be reading of MN 106.8.

My rendering follows Mp, which comments: "This is an explanation of four-pointed emptiness (catukkotisunñata). I am not anywhere (näham kxacana): He does not see [his] self anywhere. The belonging of anyone (kassaci kiñcanatasmim): He does not regard his self as an entity that could be taken up by anyone else, that is, he cannot be taken up by thinking of him as a brother in the position of a brother, a friend in the position of a friend, an employee in the position of an employee. Nor is there anywhere anything... that is mine (na ca mama kxacana): Here, we temporarily put aside the word 'mine' (mama). The meaning is then: 'He does not see anywhere the self of another.' Now, having brought in the word 'mine,' we get: [Anything] in any place that is mine (mama kxacana, katthaci kiñcanatatthi): He does not see: 'There is somewhere the self of another that might become my belonging.' The meaning is that he does not see any self of another in any position that could be taken up as his belonging: a brother in the position of a brother, a friend in the position of a friend, an employee in the position of an employee."

897 Akiñcaññamyeva patipadam patipanno hoti. Mp says that he is practicing the way without impediments, without grasping (nippalibodham niggahanameva patipadam patipanno hoti). MN 106.8, II 263,33-264,3, however, offers this formula as a meditation device for attaining the base of nothingness (äkiñcaññāyatanam samapajjati).

898 The questions and the Buddha's reply are stated as verse at SN 1:62, I 39.

899 Mp identifies both ummagga and patibhāna with wisdom (pañña): "Acumen is rising up, that is, the movement of wisdom. Or wisdom itself is called 'acumen,' in the sense of rising up. It is [also called] 'discernment' in the sense of discerning" (ummaggo ti ummujjanam, paññāgamanan ti attho. Paññā eva vā ummujjanatṭhena ummaggo ti vuccati. Sā va patibhānatthena patibhānamn).

900 There is a change in the text from ceteti in the preceding sentence to cintamano cinteti here. It is hard to determine whether this has any significance. Mp does not comment on it, so I assume it is unimportant.

901 Mp identifies him as Uddaka Rāmaputta, one of the Buddha's teachers before his enlightenment. See MN 26.16, I 165-66.

902 Mp explains the purport of this apparent digression thus: "The brahmin, being a good person himself, praises King Eleyya, his retinue, and Uddaka Rāmaputta. For the bad person is like a blind man, and a good person like one with good sight: As a blind man does not see either one who is blind or one with sight, so a bad person does not know either a good person or a bad one. But just as one with good sight can see both a blind person and one with sight, so a good person can know both a good person and a bad one. The brahmin [Vassakāra], thinking: 'Even Todeyya, being a good person, knew who were bad men,' was delighted because of this and said: 'It is astounding, Master Gotama!'"

903 Be and Ee read sotānugatānam bhikkhave dhammānam. Ce has sotānudhatānam here, and sotānudhātā honti just below, as against Be and Ee sotānugatā honti; however, Ce has sotānugatam in the uddāna verse. Mp (Ce) reads sotānugatānam. Mp glosses: "Having applied the sensory ear, one has determined [the meaning] with the ear of knowledge" (pasadasotam odahitvä ñānasotena vavatthapitānam). This seems to support sotānudhatānam, but just below Mp (Be) glosses sotānugatā honti with sotam anuppatta anupavitthā honti, which suggests the reading sotānugatānam. Mp (Ce), though reading sotānugatānam in the lemma of the earlier sentence, inconsistently reads here sotānudhatā honti. Thus a number of texts reveal that the compilers were themselves uncertain of the reading. There is no recorded Chinese parallel.

904 The sentence is highly problematic, with respect to both reading and meaning. First, the reading: with Ce I read tassa tattha sukhino dhammapadāpilapanti. I construe dhammapadāpilapanti as a sandhi formed from dhammapadā and apilapanti, meaning "to recite, to enunciate." The verb is possibly a corruption of abhilapanti (see DOP sv apilapati), Be has tassa tattha sukhino dhammapadā plavanti. Ee's dhammapadāni pilapanti, with a hiatus between pi and lapanti,
seems unacceptable. In a short paper on this passage, Norman (1992: 257-59) opines that the verb is api-lapanti $=$ abhi + lapanti. The Be reading plavanti apparently takes the verb to be from the root plu, to float, perhaps via pilavanti.

A second problem arises from the phrase tassa tattha sukhino. Sukhino can be either a dative-genitive singular or a nominative plural, and thus the phrase can be construed to mean either "to him who is happy there" (with tassa and sukhino as dative singulars denoting the same subject) or "to him, the happy ones there" (with tassa denoting the one reborn, and sukhino a nominative plural denoting those already there). The connection of the phrase with the words that follow will differ depending on which alternative is chosen. $\mathrm{Mp}^{\text {p }}$ (Be) opts for the first alternative, taking dhammapadā as the nominative subject, plavanti as the verb, and tassa sukhino as the dative indirect object: "Passages of the Dhamma float up to him who is happy there." Commenting on the phrase in this sense, Mp (Be) says: "To the one reborn who is muddled in mind in his next existence, the teachings of the Buddha's words that he had recited, being rooted in his past recitation of them, all float up clearly discerned like images in a pure mirror." Mp (Ce), interestingly, records the lemma as dhammapadāpilapanti, and reads the gloss: te sabbe pasunne adase chāyā viya apilapanti upatṭhahanti. I assume that the verb apilapanti entered here because Sinhala-script manuscripts of AN retained the original verb, which then migrated back to the commentary to replace plavanti or pilavanti. Otherwise it is hard to account for plavanti in Be. Mp (Ce) also includes the verb upatthahanti, "[they] appear to," missing in Be, perhaps through editorial oversight. This verb is evidently intended as a gloss on apilapanti/ plavanti.

I depart from Mp and follow Norman in taking tassa and sukhino to denote different persons: tassa the indirect dative object and sukhino the nominative plural subject. I take the verb to be transitive apilapanti ( $=$ abhilapanti) with dhammapadā its direct object. Norman (p. 259) affirms that neuter nouns in the accusative plural occasionally end in $-\bar{a}$. Thus I understand the line to mean that "the happy ones"-the devas in the celestial realm-"recite passages of Dhamma to him," that is, to the person reborn there.

905 Here and just below, I read with Ce and Be purimavohārā pucchimavohāraṃ.

906 I render this freely to conform to ordinary English diction. The Pāli tathäbhūto kho ayam lokasannivāso tathābhūto ayam attabhāvapaṭilābho literally means: "This dwelling in the world is
of such a nature, this obtaining of individual existence is of such a nature. . ." Lokasanniväso is also in 3:40 §2.

907 This charge is also at SN 42:13, IV 340,23-29. According to MN 56.8, I 375,24-26, it originated among the Jains.

908 This is the Buddha's advice to the Kālāmas at 3:65. The interrogation that follows also parallels that used with the Kālāmas, but with an additional unwholesome motive.

909 BHSD defines särambha as "quarrelsomeness" and connects the word with Skt samrambha, which SED explains as "the act of grasping or taking hold of," and gives as meanings "vehemence, impetuosity . . . fury, wrath against." Since the sutta speaks about sarambha as occurring through body, speech, and mind, I settle for "vehemence."

910 Ce reads lobham vineyya vineyya viharanto, and so in relation to dosa, moha, and sarambha. I try to capture this sense with "constantly," though "repeatedly" might also have been used. Be and Ee read simply lobham vineyya viharanto.

911 See MN 56.26, II 383,32-384,7.

912 The words sace ceteyyum are in Ce and Ee, but not Be.

913 Pärisuddhipadhāniyangāni. I translate the compound in accordance with Mp's resolution: pärisuddhi-atthāya padhāniyangāni.

914 Sīlapārisuddhipadhāniyangga, cittapärisuddhipadhāniyangga, ditṭhipärisuddhipadhāniyangga, vimuttipärisuddhipadhāniyangga. Sīlavisuddhi, cittavisuddhi, and ditthivisuddhi are included among the seven purifications (satta visuddhi) in MN 24, which is used as the scaffolding for Vism. The four are included among the nine pärisuddhipadhāniyangāni in DN 34.2.2, III 288,16-25, where they are all conjoined with the word visuddhi, for instance, sīlavisuddhipärisuddhipadhāniyangam. It is intriguing that no suttas on the seven purifications are included in the Sevens. This suggests a late origin for the scheme, as well as a late origin for MN 24.

915 Tattha tattha paññāya anuggahessāmi. Mp: "In this and that respect I will assist it with the wisdom of insight (vipassanāpaññāya)."

916 Since, in the Nikāyas, direct understanding of the four noble truths typically marks the attainment of stream-entry, purification of view here can be identified with the wisdom of the stream-enterer. This stands in contrast with the scheme of Vism, in which purification of view (dittihivisuddhi) is the third of the seven purifications. Vism explains it as the clear understanding of mental and material phenomena (nāmarūpavavaithāna), also known as the delimitation of conditioned phenomena (sañkhāraparicccheda). In the Vism scheme, the attainment of stream-entry (and each subsequent path) occurs only with the
seventh purification, purification of knowledge and vision (ñānadassanavisuddhi).

917 A separate purification of this name does not occur in the Vism scheme, but perhaps it could be considered the culmination of purification of knowledge and vision.

918 This seems to have been a tenet of the Jains, who sought, through the practice of self-affliction, to eradicate past kamma. See the teaching given by Nātaputta (Mahāvīra) at 3:74.

919 So navañca kammam na karoti, purānañ ca kammam phussa phussa vyantikaroti. See p. 1660, note 499. Mp's paraphrase here differs slightly from the earlier one: "Having contacted the kamma again and again by contact with knowledge, he destroys the kamma to be eliminated by means of knowledge. Having contacted the result again and again by resultant-contact, he destroys the kamma to be eliminated by [experiencing] the result."

920 Mp : "Because he has acquired equanimity, which is embraced by mindfulness and clear comprehension and has mental balance as its characteristic, 'he dwells equanimous,' mentally balanced in relation to those objects" (satisampajarī̄apariggahitāya majjhattākāralakkhạnāya upekkhaya tesu ārammanesu upekkhako majjhatto hutvä viharati).

921 This shows the arahant's attitude toward present experience. He knows that his feelings continue only as long as the body and vitality continue, and that with the perishing of the body and the extinction of vitality all feelings will come to an end. Mp explains "will become cool right here (idh'eva sitibhavissanti)" thus: "They will become cool, devoid of the disturbance and trouble caused by the occurrence [of the life process]; they will never recur. [This takes place] right here, without his going elsewhere by way of rebirth."

922 Mp : "Here is the application of the simile: The body should be seen as like the tree. Wholesome and unwholesome kamma are like the shadow depending on the tree. The meditator is like the man who wants to remove the shadow; wisdom is like the shovel; concentration is like the basket; insight is like the pick (khanitti, not mentioned in the sutta; DOP defines both kuddäla and khanitti as a digging tool, a spade, a trowel). The time of digging up the roots with the pick is like the time of cutting off ignorance with the path of arahantship. The time of reducing the stump to pieces is like the time of seeing the aggregates; the time of splitting the pieces is like the time of seeing the sense bases; the time of reducing them to slivers is like the time of seeing the elements. The time of drying the slivers in the wind and sun is like the time of applying bodily and mental energy. The time
of burning the slivers in a fire is like the time of burning the defilements with knowledge. The time of reducing them to ash is like the time when the five aggregates are still occurring [after one reaches arahantship]. The time of winnowing the ashes in a strong wind and letting them be carried away by the current is like the cessation of the five aggregates, which have been cut off at the root with no further rebirth. As the ashes winnowed and carried away go to the indiscernible state (apaññattibhāvūpagamo), so should one understand the indescribable state (appannattibhävo) [reached] by the non-arising of resultant aggregates in renewed existence."

923 The crossing of the flood (oghassa nittharana) is a metaphor for the crossing of samsāra or the eradication of defilements. The two factors mentioned by Sālha are stlavisuddhi and tapojigucchā. The latter comprises diverse types of austerity and self-mortification rejected by the Buddha in his formulation of the "middle way." In his reply, the Buddha accepts purification of virtuous behavior as one of the factors of asceticism (sāmañãanga), but rejects austerity and disgust.

924 See 3:78.

925 Mp explains right concentration spoken of above as the concentration of the path and fruit. Right view is the view of the path; the mention of the four noble truths points to the four paths and three fruits. Right liberation is the liberation of the fruit of arahantship. The mass of ignorance is split by the path of arahantship, which the disciple has reached before he gains the liberation of the fruit.

I assume this sutta is included in the Fours by way of moral purity (of body, speech, mind, and livelihood), right concentration, right view, and right liberation. However, the sutta itself is not sufficiently explicit about this and thus my numbering is hypothetical.

926 Queen Mallikā was the wife of King Pasenadi of Kosala.

927 The contents of this sutta are also included in MN 51.8-28, i $342-49$.

928 The expression occurs also at 3:66. See p. 1654, note 463.

929 The ascetic practices to be described are also at 3:156 $\$ 2$.

930 Be alone has an additional occupation here, goghatako, a cattle butcher.

931 See p. 1658, note 481.

932 Mp: "Craving is called the ensnarer (jalini) because it is like a net. For as a net is sewn tightly together and is thoroughly interwoven, so too is craving. Or it is called the ensnarer because it is a net spread out over the three realms of existence. It is
streaming (saritā) because it streams and runs on here and there. It is widespread (visatā) because it is spread out and dispersed. And it is sticky (visattikā) because it sticks, attaches, fastens here and there."

933 I translate these phrases-some obscure-with the aid of Mp. "Related to the internal" (ajjhattikassa upädāya) means related to one's own five aggregates.

934 "Related to the external" (bāhirassa upädāya) means related to external five aggregates.

935 Mp says that "because of this" (iminā) should be understood to mean "because of this form . . . because of this consciousness" (iminā rūpena vā . . . pe . . . viññānena). The passage is opaque as it stands and I am not sure that Mp has caught the original intention. "Because of this" might have meant "because of a creator God," or "because of primordial matter" or "because of chance or necessity," etc.

936 I am unsure how to explain the inclusion of this sutta in the Fours. The reason may be the four terms used to describe craving, enclosed between dashes, but this is a mere hypothesis.

937 DOP defines the verb usseneti as "forms an association (with), is involved," but Mp glosses it with ukkhipati, which DOP says can mean "throws up; raises; lifts up, picks up, holds up; raises up, extols." What follows are the twenty modes of personalexistence view (sakkayaditthi), the view of a real self existing in relation to the five aggregates. There are four modes in relation to each of the five aggregates.

938 There are different readings here: Ce apajjhāyate, Be sampajjhāyati, Ee pajjhāyati. Ee is missing this paragraph but includes the following paragraph; presumably, this was an editorial oversight rather than a difference in the manuscripts.

939 On these four terms, see p. 1681, note 656.

940 In Pāli: cintākavi, sutakavi, atthakavi, patibhānakavi. Mp says the first creates poetry after reflecting, the second does so based on what he has heard, the third based on a message, and the fourth spontaneously, through his own inspiration, like the elder Vangisa.

941 See MN 57.7-11, I 389-91.

942 Here an "afflictive bodily volitional activity" (sabyapajjham käyasañkharram) can be understood as the volition responsible for the three courses of unwholesome bodily kamma, an "afflictive verbal volitional activity" as the volition responsible for the four courses of unwholesome verbal kamma, and an "afflictive mental volitional activity" as the volition responsible for the three courses of unwholesome mental kamma.

943 The ten courses of wholesome kamma along with the volition of the jhānas.

944 The higher deva worlds.

945 Devä subhakinhā. These are the devas dwelling in the highest divine realm corresponding to the third jhāna.

946 Mp : "The volition of the path leading to the end of the round" (vivaṭtngāminī maggacetanā).

947 I follow here the reading of Ce and Ee: suññā parappavädā samanehi aññe ti. Be reads aññehi for aññe ti. The same difference in readings between the editions occurs at MN I 63,30-64,1. In a line of verse without reference to a lion's roar DN II 151,22, has suñña parappavädā samanehi aññe. Mp says that the "other sects" are the proponents of the sixty-two views, who lack twelve kinds of ascetics: the four who have attained the fruits, the four cultivating the paths, and the four practicing insight to attain the respective paths.

948 Adhikaraṇaṃ vūpasāntaṃ. See p. 1623, note 231.

949 The pārā̄ikas are the most serious class of offenses. For bhikkhus, they consist of four offenses that entail expulsion from the Sangha: sexual intercourse, theft (to a degree punishable by law), murder of a human being, and making a false claim to a superhuman state of spiritual distinction. Bhikkhunūs have four additional pārā̄ikas. The only way for one who has committed one of these offenses to "make amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma" is to admit it and relinquish one's status as a fully ordained monk or nun. For details, see Thānissaro 2007a, chap. 4.

950 The text uses the word bhante here. Apparently this word was not used solely to address monks but also others in a superior position. Thus I here translate it as "worthy sirs."

951 The sanghādisesas are the second most serious class of offenses. For bhikkhus, they include intentional emission of semen, touching a woman with a lustful mind, speaking lewdly to a woman, falsely accusing a virtuous bhikkhu of a pārā̄ika, etc. Rehabilitation involves a complex process requiring formal meetings of the Sangha. For details, see Thānissaro 2007a, chap. 5.

952 Ce and Ee assaputaṃ, Be bhasmaputaṃ. Mp: "[His deed] deserves to be punished with a reprehensible sack of ashes on his head" (garahitabbachārikāputena matthake abhighātārahaṃ).

953 The pacittiyas are a class of offenses that can be cleared by confession to a fellow monastic. Presumably the nissaggiya-pācittiyas, offenses which also require the relinquishment of an unsuitable item, are also included under this heading. For details, see Thānissaro 2007a, chaps. 7 and 8.

954 This is a smaller class of offenses that can be cleared by confession. For details, see Thānissaro 2007a, chap. 9.

955 Sikkhānisam sam idam bhikkhave brahmacariyam vussatipaññuttaram vimuttisāram satädhipateyyam. In later suttas that use these metaphors ( $8: 83,9: 14,10: 58$ ), mindfulness precedes wisdom and liberation, but the present sutta explains the reason for the inversion of the normal sequence.

956 Abhisamācārikā sikkha. Mp: "This is a designation for the type of virtuous behavior that is prescribed by way of duties" (vattavasena paññattisīlass'etaṃ adhivacanam). The commentaries draw a contrast between natural virtuous behavior (pakatisila), modes of virtuous behavior with ethical significance, and prescriptionbased virtuous behavior (paññattisila) derived from monastic rules prescribing conduct and deportment that are not intrinsically ethical, such as not eating after midday, not accepting money, not tickling another monk, etc. The latter are intended by ābhisamācārikā sikkhā.

957 Mp: "This is a designation for the four major types of virtuous behavior, which are the foundation for the spiritual life of the path" (maggabrahmacariyassa ādibhūtānaṃ cātunnam mahāsīlānam etam adhivacanam). Though Mp seems to confine this type of virtue to the four parājika offenses, it certainly includes many more training rules included among the other classes of offenses.

958 Mp does not explain in what sense paña $\bar{a}$ is called uttara, but says only: "They are well seen by the wisdom of the path along with insight" (sahavipassanāya maggapaññāya sudiṭthā honti).

959 Mp: "They are experienced by the experiential knowledge of the liberation of the fruit of arahantship" (arahattaphalavimuttiya. ñanaphassena phuttha honti).

960 As in 4:194. Mp says that insight wisdom (vipassanāpañña) is intended here.

961 See 2:55.

962 As at SN 55:60, V 411. These are also called the four factors that lead to realization of the fruit of stream-entry (and the higher fruits). See SN 55-58, V 410-11.

963 Ee conjoins this sutta with the preceding one, whereas Ce and Be treat them as distinct.

964 These correspond to the four noble truths, but with the third and fourth truths inverted.

965 As at MN 26.5, I 161-62, but the latter is augmented by two more quests: for what is subject to sorrow and for what is subject to defilement. The noble quests are at MN 26.12, I 162-63.

966 See above, 4:32. It seems to me that these two suttas should have been contiguous.

967 He is the monk who threatened to leave the Buddha if the latter would not answer his metaphysical questions. See MN 63, I 426-32, as well as MN 64.2-3, I 432-33; SN 35:95, IV 72-76.

968 See 4:9 above.

969 See SN 42:9, IV 324,25-25,3, on eight causes for the destruction of families.

970 An expanded parallel of 3:96.

971 An expanded parallel of 3:98. A parallel of 3:97, on the nonreturner, is not found among the Fours.

972 In each sutta of the cluster, 4:265-73, one of the faults comprised under (1) replaces "destroys life" in 4:264.

973 As the three fourfold practices are to be developed for direct knowledge of lust, so they are to be developed for each of the other nine purposes. Thus there are a total of thirty suttas with respect to lust.

# Notes to the Fives

974 Pañca sekhabalāni. Despite a partial overlap, these should not be confused with the five powers (pañca baläni) included among the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment, which are introduced at 5:13-16. Mp: "Trainee's powers: the powers of the seven trainees. The power of faith is so called because it does not waver ( $n a$ kampati) in the face of faithlessness; the power of moral shame does not waver in the face of moral shamelessness; the power of moral dread does not waver in the face of moral recklessness; the power of energy does not waver in the face of laziness; and the power of wisdom does not waver in the face of ignorance."

975 In Be only.

976 For the distinction between moral shame (hiri) and moral dread (ottappa), with references, see 2:8-9 and p. 1622, note 225.

977 Mp explains udayatthagāminī pañ $\bar{n} \bar{a}$, "the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away," as "the wisdom able to penetrate the arising and vanishing of the five aggregates (pañcannam khandhānaṃ udayavayagāminiyā udayañca vayañca pativijjhituṃ samatthāya). It is the wisdom of the path together with insight wisdom (vipassanāpaññāya c'eva maggapaññāya)."

978 Mp: "This is said regarding one established in the fruit of streamentry."

979 Pubbāhaṃ bhikkhave ananussutesu dhammesu abhiññā̄osānapāramippatto patijjānāmi. Mp: "'Since, by means of the four paths, I have completed the sixteenfold task in regard to the four [noble] truths, I claim to have reached consummation and perfection, having directly known it; [that is,] I have attained supremacy in accomplishing my task by finishing all tasks.' He shows the virtues, he himself reached on the terrace of the great enlightenment."

980 See 4:8 for a parallel treatment of the four grounds of selfconfidence, 6:64 for six Tathāgata's powers, and 10:21, 10:22 for the ten Tathāgata's powers.

981 These are the five powers (pañca balani) included among the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment (bodhipakkhiyā dhammā). These five powers are, as factors, identical with the five faculties (pañc'indriyāni), but the two are distinguished by a difference in aspect. See SN 48:43, V 219-20, and its commentary, Spk III 247,2-7, which explains that the faculty of faith means rulership in regard to conviction, and the power of faith means being unshakable in the face of absence of faith (adhimokkhalakkhane indatthena saddhindriyam, assaddhiye akampanena saddhäbalam). Similarly, the other four faculties respectively exercise rulership in regard to exertion, presence, non-distraction, and understanding (paggaña-üpatthāna-avikkhepa-pajānana) and the other four powers remain unshakable in the face of laziness, muddle-mindedness, distraction, and ignorance (kosajja-mutthasacca-vikkhepa-avijjä).

982. The four factors of stream-entry (cattāri sotāpattiyangāni): unwavering confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and the virtuous behavior dear to the noble ones. See 9:27, 10:92.

983 Mp: "The factor of proper conduct (äbhisamācārikaṃ dhammam) is supreme conduct consisting in prescribed virtuous behavior by way of duties (uttamasamācārabhūtaṃ vattavasena paññattasīlaṃ; see 4:245 §1, where the term used is äbhisamācārikā sikkhā). The factor of a trainee (sekhaṃ dhammam) is the virtuous behavior prescribed for a trainee. Virtuous behaviors (sīlāni) are 'the four great virtuous behaviors' (cattāri mahāsīlāni; presumably the four types of behavior safeguarded by the four pārājika rules). Right view is the right view of insight (vipassanāsammädiṭthi); right concentration is the concentration of the path and fruit."

984 From here to "not properly concentrated for the destruction of the taints" is also at SN 46:33, V 92.

985 As at 3:101, I 254,10-12. Instead of muddikaya MN III 243,21, has pavattikāya and AN I 254,10, and AN I 257,26, have pattakāya.

986 The following supernormal powers are also at 3:101. On the "suitable basis," see p. 1669, note 562.

987 Mp identifies "knowledge and vision of things as they really are" (yathäbhūtañānadassana) with tender insight; "disenchantment" (nibbidā) with strong insight; "dispassion" (virāga) with the noble path. Mp would resolve vimuttiñānadassana into vimutti and ñānadassana, with the former representing the fruit (phalavimutti) and the latter reviewing knowledge (paccavekkhanañaña). I translate, however, in accordance with the normal meaning, and regard vimutti as merely implicit here.

988 Mp: "Right view here is the right view of insight. Liberation of mind (cetovimutti) is the concentration of the path and fruit, and liberation by wisdom (paññãvimutti) is the knowledge of the fruit." Ps I 164,29-31, commenting on cetovimuttim paññãvimuttim at MNI 35,36-37, identifies liberation of mind with the concentration pertaining to the fruit of arahantship, and liberation by wisdom with the wisdom pertaining to the fruit of arahantship.

989 Vimuttāyatanāni. Mp: "Causes of being liberated" (vimuccanakāranāni).

990 So tasmiṃ dhamme atthapatisamvedī ca hoti dhammapatisamivedī ca. Mp explains atthapatisamivedī as "one knowing the meaning of the text" (pāli-attham jänantassa) and dhammapatisamivedī as "one knowing the text" (pätim jänantassa); but this explanation is certainly too narrow and anachronistic. At 6:10, we find labhati atthavedam labhati dhammavedam, which I render "[he] gains inspiration in the meaning, inspiration in the Dhamma." The stem of patisamivedī is vedī, which obviously connects atthapatisamivedī and dhammapatisamivedī to atthaveda and dhammaveda. The root vid is related both to vijjā, knowledge, and vedanā, feeling. Thus I suggest veda should be understood as inspired knowledge, or "inspiration," which gives rise to pāmojja and pīti, joy and rapture. It is likely that atthapatisamivedī and dhammapatisamivedī are related to atthapatisambhidā and dhammapatisambhidā, though in Pāli the latter are connected to the verb bhindati, "to break, to divide." See too pp. 1643-44, note 403.

991 Mp explains this to mean "he is concentrated by the concentration of the fruit of arahantship" (arahattaphalasamädhinā samädhiyati). It seems improbable to me that this was the original intention, for the context suggests that this is a concentration that serves as the basis for insight, and thereafter for the attainment of path and fruit, not a concentration that occurs subsequent to realization.

992 Appamānan. Mp: "Devoid of measure-creating qualities, worldtranscending" (pamānakaradhammarahitam lokuttaram). Normally, the Nikāyas identify the measureless concentration with the four divine abodes (brahmavihāra), but some texts also recognize a world-transcending measureless concentration, obtained with the destruction of the three "measure-producing" qualities: greed, hatred, and delusion. See MN 43.35, I 298,8-9; SN 41:7, IV 297,11-12.

993 See p. 1669, notes 560-61.

994 Be omits samädhim. Apparently this is not a typographical error, as according to a note in Ee, the same omission commonly occurs in Burmese manuscripts.

995 Since the concentration to be explained below is primarily the
four jhānas and, probably, the concentration of insight, Mp does not take the word ariya here to refer to the noble paths and fruits but as meaning "far away from the defilements abandoned by way of suppression (vikkhambhanavasena pahīnakilesehi ārakā thitassa)." In the commentaries, ariya is sometimes derived from $\bar{a} r a k a$. While the etymology is playful, it is likely that this samädhi belongs to the preparatory practice for reaching the paths and fruits, not to the paths and fruits themselves.

996 Paccavekkhananimittam. Mp identifies this as reviewing knowledge (paccavekkhanañanameva), apparently referring to the knowledge that reviews the path and fruition attainments. However, since this use of the word paccavekkhana seems peculiar to the commentaries, I think it more likely that paccavekkhananimitta here means the object being examined by insight.

997 See p. 1669, note 562.

998 Citathitiko hoti. Mp: "If one has acquired the mark [of concentration] while standing up, it is lost when one sits down. If one has acquired the mark while sitting, it is lost when one lies down. But for one who has resolved on walking up and down and acquired the mark in a moving object, it is not lost even when one stands still, sits down, and lies down."

999 Mp says that insight (vipassana) has been discussed here in five ways.

1000 Mp identifies her as a daughter of King Pasenadi of Kosala.

1001 See 4:87 §4.

1002 Only four kinds of superiority are mentioned, unless the fifth is wealth (bhoga) rather than authority (ädhipateyya), as mentioned in the following couplet.

1003 This includes an expanded parallel of 4:34.

1004 Mp , commenting on the preceding sutta, says she was a daughter of King Bimbisāra.

1005 Strangely, neither Ce nor Ee contains this paragraph, which is in Be. It seems necessary to complete the set of five items. The paragraph is found in all three editions of the Fours. The parallel It $\S 90,88$, does not include this paragraph, but It $\S 90$ is included in the Threes and thus must limit itself to three objects of faith.

1006 Virăge dhamme. The parallel statement at 4:34 has only virăge, but It $\S 90$ has virăge dhamme.

1007 These verses are also at 4:34.

1008 Attacatuttho. Lit.; "[with]-self-[as]-fourth," meaning that the Buddha is invited with three monks accompanying him.

1009 Manäpakāyikañam devānaṃ. It is uncertain whether they are called thus in the sense that their bodies are agreeable, or in the sense that they belong to an agreeable group. The word kāya can mean
either the physical body or a group. Mp identifies these deities with the "devas who delight in creation." Because they create any form that they wish and take delight in it, they are called either "delighting in creation" or "agreeable" (manäpā nāma té devā ti nimmānaratt devā; te hi icchiticchitam rūpam māpetvā abhiramanato nimmānaratt ti ca manāpā ti ca vuccanti). See 8:46, where the Buddha enumerates eight conditions that lead to rebirth into the company of the agreeable-bodied devas.

1010 There are various readings of the compound here: Ce icchācārena, Be issācārena, Ee issāvädena. My translation follows Ee. Interestingly, at 8:46, there is a verse with an identical couplet but with the reading issā̃ādena in all three editions. A search through CST 4.0 for icchācār* turns up many occurrences of this compound in commentarial texts but none in canonical texts. It thus seems likely that the Ce reading has been influenced by the editor's familiarity with the commentarial expression.

1011 He was originally a lay follower of the Jains. The story of his conversion is told at 8:12.

1012 Sanditthikam dānaphalam. A benefit that can be experienced in this present life.

1013 Visärado upasañkamati amañkubhūto. Mp explains "confidently" (visärado) as knowledgeable and joyous (ñannasomänassappatto) and "composed" (amañkubhüto) as not diffident (na nittejabhüto).

1014 Samparāyikam dānaphalam. With this fifth benefit, the Buddha has gone beyond Sīha's original request and explained, not a directly visible fruit of giving, but a fruit pertaining to the next life.

1015 Nandana: the Garden of Delight in the Tāvatimsa heaven.

1016 Ayum, vamnam, sukham, balam, patibhānam. See 4:57, 4:58.

1017 They "show compassion" (anukampeyyum) to them by offering them an opportunity to give alms and thereby acquire merit. Thus it is not so much the laypeople who show compassion to the monastics by giving them alms (though this is true), but the monastic who shows compassion to laypeople by approaching their homes to receive their offerings. By giving alms laypeople create the seeds for a happy rebirth and the attainment of nibbāna. The monastics may also teach the Dhamma to the laypeople and in this way give them access to the teachings.

1018 An expanded parallel of 3:48. All the items mentioned in the simile of the mountain are identical in both suttas, but 3:48 reduces them to three by grouping together several as compounds, while the present sutta enumerates them separately. The present sutta adds learning (suta) and generosity (cäga) to the things people grow in. The verses are identical in both suttas.

1019 Here and below, I read kulapatim with Ce and Ee, as against Be
kulaputtam. Be of my 3:48 (3:49 in Be's own enumeration) has kulapatim in the corresponding place.

1020 From this part on, this sutta closely parallels 4:61. The five items are obtained by dividing the first of the latter into two parts. The verses in the two suttas are identical.

1021 I read with Be and Ee dhammaguttam, as against Ce devaguttam, which seems redundant here.

1022 Compare with the opening of 4:61.

1023 In each paragraph, I read with Ce vā pihetum, as against Be vāpi hetu, Ee vā pi hetum. The verb piheti (infinitive pihetum) means "to yearn for." The idea of passively yearning seems implied by the contrast with practicing the way as a means of fulfilling one's wish.

1024 Ayusamvattanikā patipadā. Mp: "The meritorious practice of giving, virtuous behavior, etc." For an analysis of the specific relationship between present actions and their results, see MN 135.

1025 The text switches back and forth between singular and plural forms of sagga.

1026 These verses are also at SN 3:17, I 87; SN 3:18, I 89.

1027 Atthäbhisamaya. I base this rendering on the gloss in Mp: Atthassa abhisamägamena, atthappatiläbhenā ti vuttam hoti.

1028 Sālapupphakan khädaniyam. Mp: "A food similar to sal flour; it is made with hill-rice flour prepared with the four sweets (honey, sugar, butter, and ghee)."

1029 Reading with Be sampannakolakam stikaramamsam. Mp: "The flesh of a one-year-old pig cooked with spices such as cumin seeds, etc., together with sweet jujube fruits."

1030 Ce nibaddhatelakam nāliyasākaṃ (Be nibattatelakam nāliyasākaṃ). Mp: "The vegetable stalks are cooked in ghee mixed with cumin and other spices, which have been pulverized together with hillrice flour; then they are coated with the four sweets and put out until they acquire a particular aroma."

1031 So Ce. Be and Ee "over a hundred thousand" (adhikasatasahassam). Presumably this refers to kahāpanas, the major currency unit.

1032 Reading with Ce anaggahitam, as against Be and Ee anuggahitam.

1033 Aññataram manomayam käyam upapajjati. I follow Mp in taking this expression, as used here, to mean that he was reborn among a group (käya) of deities rather than that he was reborn with a mind-made body. Mp: "[Reborn] into a group of devas in the pure abodes who are produced through the mind of jhāna" (suddhāväsesu ckaṃ jhänamanena nibbattam devakāyam). Also, at AN III 348,28-349,1 (=V 139,5-8) we find tusitam käyam upapanno, where käyam must mean "group." In relation to the spiritual
powers, manomaya kāya signifies a subtle body produced by the meditative mind, as at AN I 24,2. See too 5:166.

1034 It is hard to see why this sutta is included in the Fives. Could it be that the original version had only five items of offering and a sixth was added later, after the sutta was included in the Fives?

1035 This is an expanded parallel of 4:51. The additional factor is obtained by replacing "a lodging" (senāsanam) with "a dwelling" (vihāram) and "bed and chair" (mañcapitham).

1036 As in Be and Ee. The omission from Ce must be an editorial oversight, as the thousands of gallons are in the Ce version of 4:51.

1037 I have filled in this definition here; all three editions abridge.

1038 The verses are also at 4:52.

1039 The text uses a reflexive causative form: attānamyeva parinibbāpeti. This might also have been rendered: "He extinguishes himself," or "He quenches himself." What is literally extinguished is the bitter feeling of sorrow, but the verb parinibbāpeti, related to the noun nibbāna, implies that he reaches ultimate liberation.

1040 I read with Ee attho idha labbhā api appako pi (Be is essentially the same). Ce attho alabbho api appako pi means "even the least good cannot be gained," which undermines the point.

1041 Paveniyā. Mp: "By family custom (kulavamisena). The meaning is, 'We have traditionally practiced this, and we have not practiced that.'"

1042 This sentence is in the text of Ee, but in parentheses in Be and in a note in Ce.

1043 Sokasallaharano nāma ayam mahārāja dhammapariyāyo.

1044 Nangalamukhāni. Lit. "plow mouths." Mp glosses as "channel mouths" (mātikāmukhāni), explaining: "Because these are similar to plows and are cut by plows, they are called 'plow mouths.'"

1045 Also at SN 47:5, V 145,26-146,5, followed by a declaration that the four establishments of mindfulness are "a heap of the wholesome" (kusalarāsī). Here I follow Be and Ee, which do not include ime in the opening. Ce has ime both in the opening and at the end; Be does not have it in either place.

1046 Na sukaram uñchena paggahena yāpetun. I take uñchena paggahena to denote a single act, not two acts. There is no $c a$ or $v \bar{a}$ to suggest that two acts are intended. The gloss in Mp also implies that the expression refers to one act: "It is not possible to take one's bowl and sustain oneself by the practice of gleaning" (na sakkä hoti pattam gahetvā uñchācariyāya yāpetum). See too the gloss at Sp I 175,22-23: paggahena yo uñcho, tena yāpetum na sukarā.

1047 Aññamaññam akkosā ca honti, aññamaññam paribhāsā ca honti, aññamaññam parikkhepā ca honti, aññamaññam pariccajā ca honti. A
similar passage in It $\S \S 18-19,10-11$, has aññamaññam bhandanāni ceva honti instead of aññamaññam akkosā ca honti but is otherwise the same. I translate parikkhepā and pariccajana in accordance with It-a I 69,25-27, which explains parikkhepā as "disparagement and denigration through the ten bases of insults, attacking all around in terms of birth and so forth" (jāti-ädivasena parito khepā, dasahi akkosavatthūhi khumsanavambhanā), and pariccajanā as "dismissal by way of disciplinary acts of suspension and so forth" (ukkhepaniyakammakarañädivasena nissārañā).

1048 It might be asked whether the expression pasannānañca bhiyyobhāvo hoti means that the number of those with confidence increases, or, alternatively, that those with confidence increase in confidence. Sp I 225,18-24, supports the latter: "Laypeople who have confidence in the Teaching, seeing the bhikkhus following the training rules as they have been established, become ever more confident; saying: 'The monks indeed do what is hard to do; for as long as they live they eat once a day, maintain celibacy, and observe the restraint of the Vinaya" (yepi sāsane pasannā kulaputtā tepi sikkhāpadapaññattim ñatvā yathāpaññattam pațipajjamāne bhikkhū vā disvā "aho ayyā dukkarakärino, ye yāvajīvaṃ ekabhattam brahmacariyam vinayasamvaram anupāenti" ti bhiyyo bhiyyo pasidanti).

1049 Tesam abhinham dassanā samisaggo ahosi, samisagge sati vissāso ahosi; vissāse sati otāro ahosi. Though I translate vissāso as "intimacy," the word does not mean that at this point they had intimate physical relations. Vissāso is, rather, a feeling of trust that can lead to a sexual relationship. For this to occur, however, intimacy must first provide an opening for lust. This is indicated by the expression otāro ahosi.

1050 A violation of the first pārā̄ika or expulsion offense.

1051 I follow the sequence of Be and Ee, which read giddhā gathitā mucchitā ajjhopanna, as against Ce gathitā giddhā mucchitā ajjhopanna. The sequence-gathita, mucchita, ajjhopanna-is common in the texts.

1052 Be and Ee ugghātitā (Ce ugghānitā). Mp glosses with uddhumātā, "bloated," a stage in the decomposition of a corpse. Five such stages are mentioned at 1:480-84. Perhaps the next item, the dead woman, refers to a deceased woman preserved in memory rather than a corpse. Brahmāli suggests taking ugghātitā as "obese," but I'm not sure this would work. DOP sv ugghäteti ${ }^{2}$ gives "puffedup, swollen" among its meanings.

1053 Here Ce has merely yampi tam bhikkhave sammā vadamāno vadeyya samantapāso märassā ti, which is incomplete. Hence I follow Be and Ee: yam hi tam bhikkhave sammā vadamāno vadeyya samantapāso
mārassā ti mātugāmaṃ yeva sammā vadamāno vadeyya samantapāso märassā ti.

1054 Suvāsido: based on the verb āsīdati, to approach, with prefix suand $-v$ - as a liaison consonant.

1055 Mp glosses purakkhatā with "forerunners, those who have gone in front" (purecārikā purato gatāyeva). My rendering "are plunged headlong" is free but captures the sense. Vanarata suggests that kālaṇi, gatim, and bhaväbhavam may be abbreviated locatives or split compound factors to be joined with samsārasmiṃ, but I think the verse may use the accusative for metrical reasons. There is no identified Chinese parallel of this sutta with which to make a comparison.

1056 The expression "I live the spiritual life dissatisfied" (anabhirato ca brāhmacariyam carāmi) implies that he wants to disrobe and return to lay life.

1057 Here the text changes to the plural bhikkhave. The Buddha is now addressing the monks at large.

1058 The first three themes echo 3:39, with which this sutta has much in common.

1059 Sabbehi me piyehi manäpehi. I use "everyone and everything" to cover both persons and possessions. The Pāli implies both, but in English we need two words to span both objects.

1060 Mp : "The path is generated (maggo sañjāyati): the worldtranscending path is generated. The fetters are entirely abandoned (sämyojanāni sabbaso pahīyanti): the ten fetters are entirely abandoned (see 10:13). The underlying tendencies are uprooted (anusay $\bar{a}$ byantīhonti): the seven underlying tendencies are removed, cut off, terminated (see 7:11). Thus in the above five sections insight is discussed; in these five sections, the world-transcending path."

1061 These verses are also at 3:39. They seem to be a self-reproach spoken by the bodhisatta prior to his enlightenment and thus fit better there. The line below-"while I am dwelling thus" (mama evam vihärino)-suggests that this is the bodhisatta speaking with reference to his struggle for enlightenment. In pāda c I read with Ce yathädhammā tathāsantā, as against Be and Ee yathā dhammā tathā sattā (though they both concur with Ce in their reading of the earlier sutta).

1062 Ce and Be read nekkhamme datthu khematam. Ee has nekkhammaṃ datthu khemato as its primary reading but mentions the $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Be}$ variants in its notes. Mp (both Ce and Be ) uses the Ce and Be reading as the lemma, which it glosses nibbāne khemabhāvam disvā, but it then cites the Ee reading as a variant, glossed nibbānam khemato disvā. Thus Ee has chosen the variant as the primary reading.

1063 Mp glosses pacchāliyaṃ khipanti with: "They come up behind them and strike their backs with their foot" (pacchato gantvā pitṭhim pädena paharanti).

1064 Reading with Ce and Ee: khettakammantasāmantasaṃvohāre. Mp (Ce): "The owners of the neighboring fields bordering his own fields, and those with whom he does business, who measure the land with measuring rods" (ye attano khettakammantānaṃ sāmantā anantarakkhettasāmino, te ca rajjudaṇdehi bhūmippamānaagāahake saṃvohāre ca). I do not see that samvohāra, which normally means "transactions, business," has an explicit connection with the measuring of the land.

1065 Balipatiggahikā devatā. Mp: "The protective deities that have been worshipped by family tradition."

1066 The perception of unattractiveness (asubhasaññā) is explained at 10:60 §3; the perception of death, or mindfulness of death (maranasañña, maranassati), at 6:19-20 and 8:73-74; the perception of danger (ädīnavasañña), at 10:60 §4; the perception of the repulsiveness of food (ähäre patikkūlasañña), at Vism 341-47, Ppn 11.1-26; and the perception of non-delight in the entire world (sabbaloke anabhiratasañña), at 10:60 §8.

1067 The perception of impermanence (aniccasañña) is at 10:60 §1, the perception of non-self (anattasañña) at 10:60 §2.

1068 Mp : "To live together: asking questions and answering questions" (sājīvo ti pañhapucchanañceva pañhavissajjanañca).

1069 For an analysis of the formula for the four bases, see SN 51:13, V 268-69.

1070 The word ussothi, translated here as "enthusiasm," is glossed by Mp with adhimattaviriyam, "exceptional energy."

1071 See 5:14.

1072 This and below as at MN 22.30-35, I 139-40.

1073 The perception of abandoning (pahänasañña) and the perception of dispassion (virāgasañña) are respectively at 10:60 $\$ 5$ and 10:60 §6. Ce, both printed and electronic editions, also includes nirodhasañña, apparently an editorial error that would raise the number of perceptions to six.

1074 Dhammavihärī. The compound might also have been rendered "one who lives by the Dhamma."

1075 I read with Ce dhammasaññattiya here and saññattibahulo just below, as against Be and Ee dhammapaññattiya and paññattibahulo respectively.

1076 Anuyuñjatiajjhattaṃ cetosamathạ̣. Mp: "He pursues and develops mental concentration within himself; he is intent on and devoted to a serenity meditation subject" (niyakajjhatte cittasamädhiṇ asexati bhāveti, samathakammatthāne yuttappayutto hoti).

1077 Uttarim c'assa paññāya atthạ̣ nappajānāti. Mp: "Beyond his
learning, he does not understand the meaning of that Dhamma by path wisdom together with insight; he does not see and penetrate the four [noble] truths" (tato pariyattito uttarim tassa dham-massa sahavipassanāya maggapaññāya atihum nappajānāti, cattāri saccāni na paṣsati nappativijjhati).

1078 Rajaggan. Mp: "The mass of dust arisen from the ground, which has been trampled upon by the feet of the elephants, horses, etc."

1079 This is the prescribed method for renouncing monastic status. One declares to another person (normally a fellow bhikkhu) one's inability to observe the training, exchanges one's robes for ordinary clothing, takes the five lay precepts, and returns to lay life.

1080 I follow Be and Ee, which do not have ellipsis points here. Ce inconsistently has ellipsis points in this suita (implying that all three vijj $\bar{a}$ are intended) but not in the parallel section of the next sutta.

1081 The following exhortation is also at MN 22.3, I 130,23-31. Many of these similes for sensual pleasures are elaborated at MN 54.1521, I $364-67$.

1082 Vāla amanussa, lit., "wild nonhumans." Mp glosses "such nonhumans as rough, violent yakkhas, etc." (kakkha!̣a dutṭha yakkhādayo amanussā).

1083 Mp does not comment on abhāvitakāyā, but Spk II 395,16 glosses it as abhāvitapañcadvārikakāy $\bar{a}$, "undeveloped in the body of the five sense doors," probably referring to sense restraint. I suspect the term actually refers to the maintenance of clear comprehension in all modes of deportment and in the various bodily activities, as described at AN II 210,21-26 and V 206,25-30.

1084 Iti kho, bhikkhave, dhammasandosa vinayasandoso; vinayasandosa $\bar{a}$ dhammasandoso. Mp: "How is it that when the Dhamma is becoming corrupt, the discipline becomes corrupt? When the dhammas of serenity and insight are no longer being nurtured, the fivefold discipline no longer exists. But when there is no discipline of restraint among those who are immoral, in its absence serenity and insight are not nurtured. In this way, through corruption of the discipline, there is corruption of the Dhamma." The fivefold discipline by restraint is restraint by virtuous behavior, mindfulness, knowledge, patience, and energy (sīlasamvara, satisamvara, ñānasamvara, khantisamvara, viriyasamvara). See Ps I 62,23-25, commenting on the Sabbāsava Sutta.

1085 Nissaya. A procedure prescribed in the Vinaya by which a junior bhikkhu apprentices himself to a qualified senior bhikkhu, normally his preceptor or teacher. A similar procedure is prescribed for bhikkhunis. The period of nissaya is normally the first five
years after a bhikkhu's full ordination, but it can be extended in the case of one who needs more time to gain competence. For details, see Thānissaro 2007a: 29-40.

1086 Abhidhammakatham vedallakathami kathentā. I take the word abhidhamma here to have a purely referential function, that is, to mean "pertaining to the Dhamma, relating to the Dhamma." It does not denote the canonical collection of that name or its philosophy. See DOP sv abhidhamme. Mp, too, appears to recognize that the Abhidhamma Pitaka is not relevant here, explaining abhidhammakathami in this passage as a discussion on "the supreme teaching concerned with virtuous behavior, etc." (sīlādi-uttamadhammakathami). It takes vedallakatham to be a "miscellaneous talk on knowledge connected with inspirational joy" (vedapatisamyuttam ñānamissakakathami). MN 43 and MN 44 have vedalla in their title and proceed by way of miscellaneous questions and answers between disciples. The "dark Dhamma" (kanhädhammam) is said to occur by way of faultfinding with a mind bent on criticizing others (randhagavesitāya upārambhapariyesariavasena).

1087 See 2:47.

1088 Samsatṭhā viharissanti. Mp: "They will bond closely by way of the fivefold bond (pañcavidhena samsaggena)." Mp-t: "Fivefold bond: bonding by hearing, seeing, conversation, eating together, and bodily contact" (savanasamsaggo, dassanasamsaggo, samullāpasamsaggo, sambhogasamsaggo, kāyasamsaggo). Mp-t identifies them all as manifestations of lust and exemplifies the last by the lust arisen through holding hands (hatthaggāha, a sānghādisesa offense when it occurs between a bhikkhu and a woman). Female probationers (sikkhamānā) are nuns already ordained as novices who are formally training for full bhikkhuni ordination.

1089 A defiled offense (sañkilittham āpattiṃ) here would be a pārājika or a sanghādisesa.

1090 Use of stored-up food (sannidhikāraparibhoga) is prohibited by Pācittiya 38, Vin IV 86-87. Regarding "giving a gross hint" (otārikaṃ nimittam), Mp says: "Here, digging the ground and ordering 'Dig!' is called giving a gross hint in regard to the ground. Cutting and ordering 'Cut!' is called giving a gross hint with regard to vegetation." The reference is to Pācittiyas 10 and 11, Vin IV 32-33, 33-35.

1091 Kuhako ca hoti, lapako ca, nemittiko ca, nippesiko ca, lābhena ca lābham nijigisita. These are forms of wrong livelihood, discussed more fully at Vibh 352-53 (Be $\S \S 861-65$ ); they are elaborated at Vism 23-30, Ppn 1.61-82.

1092 On the four patisambhidās, see 4:172.

1093 I follow Ce sātthā sabyañjanā, as against Be and Ee sāttham
sabyañjanam. The same difference appears wherever this phrase occurs. The difference is not trivial; it indicates that for Ce , meaning and phrasing pertain to the dhamma, whereas for Be and Ee they pertain to the brahmacariyam, the practice of the spiritual life. The terms make better sense in relation to dhamm $\bar{a}$, teachings that are verbally articulated, than in relation to the brahmacariyam, which is lived rather than spoken.

1094 Be reads here ditthiya. appatividdha, "not penetrated by view," which seems a learned "correction" to a stock formula. Otherwise we would have expected an adversative conjunction, such as ca or ca pana, to prepare us for the variation on the usual reading. Ce and Ee have the familiar ditthiya suppatividdha, which I follow.

1095 Yathāvimuttam cittam na paccavekkhati. Mp: "Having reviewed which faults have been abandoned and which virtues have been obtained, he does not make an effort to obtain higher virtues." This passage seems to presage the idea of paccavekkhanañana, which figures prominently in the commentaries.

1096 Mp : "This sutta has discussed the causes for decline and growth of the seven trainees in relation to the higher virtues. The causes for decline of a trainee occur first to the worldling."

1097 Ananulomikena gihisamsaggena. On the five kinds of samsagga, see p. 1733, note 1088.

1098 Aññābyākarañāni. Mp: "Declarations of arahantship."

1099 Akuppam. Probably meaning akuppa cetovimutti, unshakable liberation of mind. Mp identifies this with arahantship.

1100 Sakkaccaññeva deti no asakkaccam. Mp: "He gives the blow without despising, without transgressing; he does not do so despising and transgressing."

1101 Annabhāranesadānam. Mp glosses annabhārā as beggars (yācaka) and nesādā as fowlers (sakunikaa).

1102 The opening story, together with the discourse on the five kinds of teachers, is at Vin II 185-87.

1103 Manomayam käyam upapanno. The mind-made deities are those reborn in the form realm through the power of their past attainment of the jhānas.

1104 The word for "body" here is attabhāvapaṭiläbha. I take paṭiläbha to be merely an idiomatic adjunct and do not think it adds anything to the meaning. Mp glosses as sartrapatiläbho, which supports my supposition that the simple physical body is intended here. The expression attabhāvapaṭiläbha occurs in 4:171, where it designates the entire typology of a living being. In that text it cannot be construed narrowly as the physical body, since it also encompasses "the devas of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception," who lack physical bodies.

On the size of his body, the text reads dve vā tīni vā māgadhikāni gämakkhettāni. On gämakkhetta Brahmāli writes: "This word also occurs at MN III 10,11: ekaṃ gämakkhettam upanissāya viharāma, and at MN II 167,27: amhäkaṃ gämakkhettam āgacchanti. From these passages it seems quite clear to me that gämakkhetta refers to a village together with all its fields" (private communication). The figures for length given by Mp suggest that his body was 3-4.5 miles or $5-7 \mathrm{~km}$ tall.

1105 The text says tassa iddhiyā, "that psychic potency," not tassa iddhiyā, "his psychic potency." The pronoun refers to a psychic power already mentioned, yet the sutta does not make clear what it is. The context is provided by Vin II 184,33-185,21, where Devadatta exercises the psychic power of transforming himself into a young boy wearing a girdle of snakes. He used this power to impress Prince Ajātasattu and win his support. Thereupon Devadatta thought to wrest control of the Sangha from the Buddha, whereupon he lost that psychic potency.

1106 Yaṃ tumo karissati tumo'va' tena paññāyissati. PED explains the stem tuma as "most likely apostrophe form of ātuma = attā, Skt atman self." Mp paraphrases: "One will be known by the action that one does" (yaṃ esa karissati, eso'va tena kammena pākuto bhavissati).

1107 Aparisuddhaveyyäkaraṇo. Mp does not comment. Presumably, this refers to his explanation of a point in his teaching or his reply to a question.

1108 Sekhavesārajjakaraṇā dhammā.

1109 Sārajjam. Mp glosses with domanassam, "dejection," but this does not seem sufficiently precise. Sārajja is the condition of one who feels timid, hesitant, and insecure (särada) when having to appear in public or take a stand in community affairs. Its opposite, vesārajja, is the condition of one who feels at ease and selfconfident (visärada) when interacting with others.

1110 Ee's kuppadhammo is evidently an error, though in the notes on variant readings Ee recognizes the correct reading, akuppadhammo. Mp glosses with khīnāsavo, one whose taints are destroyed, an arahant. For the Sangha to maintain the respect of the lay community, it is considered important not only for monastics to be virtuous in their behavior but to avoid actions that might arouse suspicion. Such behavior not only reflects adversely on the individual monastic but may also bring discredit to the Dhamma and the Sangha. Hence this exhortation.

1111 Mp glosses vesiyägocaro with tāsam geham abhinhagamano, "frequently going to their homes." Thus gocara in the narrow sense of an alms resort is not necessarily intended here.

1112 An expanded parallel of 3:50.

1113 Gahanāni, lit. "takings." Mp: "The taking of others' belongings" (parasantakānam bhandānam gahanāni).

1114 Guyhamantā. Here mantā must mean "deliberations" or "consultations," not mantras. Mp offers only a verbal gloss, guhitabbamantā.

1115 Antaggāhikāya. Mp: "He grasps hold of eternalism or annihilationism."

1116 This sutta reproduces 4:87 $\S 4$, the delicate ascetic among ascetics section, here divided into five secondary sections.

1117 Phāsuvihārā. These are five of the better known six principles of cordiality, at 6:11-12.

1118 No param adhisile sampavattā. I take adhisile here to have the purely referential sense "in regard to virtuous behavior," and not to imply "higher virtuous behavior" (though, of course, since "virtuous behavior" is identified with restraint by the Pātimokkha, the "higher virtuous behavior" is implied). Mp supports this referential understanding of adhisile with its gloss: "He does not censure or reproach others in regard to virtuous behavior" (param sīlabhāvena na garahati na upavadati).

1119 Cātuddiso. Mp: "He moves about without obstruction in the four quarters" (catūsu disāsu appaṭihatacāro).

1120 Ce does not have a title at the beginning of the vagga, but it includes the title before the uddāna verse at the end.

1121 The meaning is not transparent and readings vary. Ce viyatthūpasevī, Ee vyatthūpasevī, Be vissațthupasevī. Mp (Be) explains: "He consorts with divided families for the sake of creating friction" (vissatṭhāni bhinnakulāni ghațanatthāya upasevati.). Mp (Ce) has viyatthāni bhinnakakulāni.

1122 Sammādassana. This is synonymous with right view (sammādiṭthi). Mp paraphrases: "Be possessed of the five kinds of right view: of responsibility for one's kamma, of jhāna, of insight, of the path, and of the fruit."

1123 Mp: "She is miserly with her dwelling (āvāsamaccharinī) and cannot endure others living there. She is miserly with the families (kulamaccharinī) that support her and cannot endure others approaching them [for support]. She is miserly with gains (lābhamaccharinī) and cannot endure others acquiring them. She is miserly with her virtues (gunamaccharinī) and cannot endure talk about the virtues of others. And she is miserly with the Dhamma (dhammamaccharinī) and does not wish to share it with others."

1124 Saddhädrryyaṃ vinipäteti. Mp: "When she is given almsfood by others out of faith, without taking the top portion [for herself], she gives it to someone else." The rule against squandering gifts
given out of faith is at Vin 1 298,1-3: "Bhikkhus, a gift given out of faith should not be squandered. For one who squanders it, there is an offense of wrongdoing" (na ca bhikkhave saddhādeyyaṃ vinipātetabbaṃ; yo vinipāteyya, āpatti dukkataasa). This is an offense because it shows disregard for the generosity of others. After taking the top portion for oneself, however, one can share the rest with others. The Buddha also made a unique allowance for a monastic to give almsfood, cloth, and other gains to his or her parents if they are in need.

1125 I follow the punctuation of Be and Ee, which connect dhammānam udayatthagāminiyā paññāya with the preceding ajjhattaṃ yeva sati sūpatthitā hoti. Ce puts a comma after hoti and no punctuation after paññāya, thus connecting dhammānaṃ udayatthagāminiyā paññāya with the following asubhānupassī kāye viharati. This, however, connects the meditation on the body's unattractive nature with the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, a connection that, to my knowledge, is not made elsewhere in the Nikāyas (apart from the repetitive refrain in the Satipatṭhāna Sutta).

1126 Sn 386 suggests that akalacart refers to walking for alms at an improper time.

1127 On contentment, see p. 1600, note 55.

1128 Mp explains parikuppā as "something with an irritating nature, similar to an old wound" (parikuppanasabhāvā purānavanasadisā). More commonly these acts are known as the anantariya kamma, grave deeds that bring as their immediate result a rebirth in hell. See 6:93.

1129 Disaster regarding virtuous behavior (stlavyasana) obviously refers to conduct that violates the five ethical precepts, and disaster regarding view (diṭthivyasana) to the adoption of a wrong view, particularly the view that denies the principle of kamma and its results.

1130 Dhammen'eva cakkam vatteti. 'Mp: "'Dhamma' here is the ten wholesome [courses of kamma]."

1131 Mp: "Who knows what is good (atthañ $\tilde{n} \bar{u}$ ): who knows the fivefold good ( $\mathrm{Mp}-\mathrm{t}$ : one's own good, the good of others, the good of both, the good pertaining to this present life, and the good pertaining to future lives). Who knows the Dhamma (dhammañ $\tilde{n} \bar{u}$ ): who knows the fourfold Dhamma ( $\mathrm{Mp}-\mathrm{t}$ : the Dhamma of the four truths, or the four kinds of dhammas distinguished into those of the sense sphere, the form realm, the formless realm, and the world-transcending). Who knows the right measure (mattaññū): who knows the right measure in accepting and using the four requisites. Who knows the proper time (kalaññu): who knows the time thus, 'This is the time for seclusion, this is the time for meditative attainment,
this is the time for teaching the Dhamma, and this is the time for touring the country.' Who knows the assembly (parisañña): who knows, 'This is an assembly of khattiyas . . . this is an assembly of ascetics.'"

1132 See 1:187.

1133 See 3:14.

1134 In commenting on samsuddhagahaniko yāva sattamā pitāmahayugā akkhitto anupakkuttho jātivādena, Mp says that yāva sattamā pitāmahayugā can be construed in apposition either to samsuddhagahaniko or to akkhitto anupakkuttho jātivädena. Be and Ee punctuate as if it should be taken in the former way, Ce as if it should be taken in the latter way. I follow Ce .

1135 Patibalo atitānāgatapaccuppanne atthe cintetum. Mp explains: "Through present benefits, he considers what happened in the past and what will happen in the future" (so hi paccuppannaatthavaseneva "atitepi evam ahesum, anāgatepi evam bhavissantí"ti cinteti).

1136 Salākaggāhī. Mp: "At the time of counting the elephants, he takes a ticket." Apparently they used tickets, or pieces of straw, to count the elephants.

1137 Ce pithamaddano; Be mañcapithamaddano, "a crusher of beds and chairs."

1138 Mp: "At the time of counting the bhikkhus, he takes a ticket."

1139 I prefer Ee dhammehi here to Ce and Be añgehi. The concluding paragraph of this section, and the corresponding opening and closing paragraph on the accomplished bhikkhu, all have dhammehi.

1140 Mp: "He violates (arabhati): he violates by committing an offense [against the monastic rules], and then becomes remorseful (vippatisär1 co hoti) because of that. Liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom is the concentration of arahantship and the knowledge of the fruit of arahantship. He does not understand this because he has not attained it."

1141 Mp: "He commits an offense, but rehabilitates himself and thus does not become remorseful."

1142 Mp: "Having committed an offense once, he rehabilitates himself but afterward, though he does not commit an offense, he cannot dispel remorse." This probably refers to the case, often cited in the Vinaya, where a monk wrongly believes that he has committed an offense.

1143 Mp: "Abandon the taints born of transgression by confessing the offense or by rehabilitating yourself from the offense. Then develop the mind of insight (vipassanācittam) and the wisdom conjoined with it."

1144 This mode of practice is explained at Paṭis II 212-13, where it is called the psychic potency of the noble ones (ariy'iddhi). The following explanations of Mp are drawn from that source: (1) "Perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive (appatiküle patikülasaññī): He observes a desirable object with the idea of its unattractiveness or he attends to it as impermanent. (2) Perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive (patiküle appatikülasaññī): He observes an undesirable object with loving-kindness or attends to it by way of elements. (3-4) In the third and fourth sections, he applies respectively the first and second methods to both kinds of objects. (5) To dwell eguanimous (upekkhako vihareyya): this is the six-factored equa-1imity [that is, equanimity regarding the six sense objects] similar to that of an arahant. In this sutta, insight is explained in the five cases. It is possible for a bhikkhu who has initiated insight to do this; it is also possible for a knowledgeable, wise, and learned person to do this. The stream-enterer, once-returner, and nonreturner definitely can do this; there is no need to say anything about the arahant."

1145 Mā me kvacini katthaci kiñcana rajanīyesu dhammesu rāgo udapādi, $m \bar{a}$ me kvacini katthaci kiñcana dosanīyesu dhammesu doso udapādi, $m \bar{a}$ me kvacini katthaci kiñcana mohanīyesu dhammesu moho udapādī. The formulation here seems deliberately stronger and more comprehensive than in the previous cases. Mp glosses: Kvacani ti kismī̄ci ārammane. Katthacī ti kismīñci padese. Kiñcana ti koci appamattakopi.

1146 Anāgamanaditthiko deti. Mp: "One gives without having brought forth the view of arrival thus: 'The fruit of what has been done will arrive.'" Presumably the view of kamma and its result is intended.

1147 Agamanaditthiko. Mp: "He gives with faith in kamma and its result."

1148 Samayavimuttassa bhikkhuno. Mp: "One who is liberated in mind through a mundane liberation, a tentative liberation, through the suppression of the defilements in absorption."

1149 I title this after the Be uddāna verse, which reads tayo sammattaniyāmā, as against Ce and Ee tayo saddhammaniyāmā.

1150 Abhabbo niyāmaṃ okkamituṃ kusalesu dhammesu sammattan. Mp: "One is unqualified, incapable of entering upon the fixed course of the path, which [consists in] rightness in wholesome qualities" (kusalesu dhammesu sammattabhūtạ̣ magganiyāmaṃ okkamituṃ abhabbo abhājanam). See too 3:22 and p. 1638, note 358.

1151 As at 4:160. See too 2:20.

1152 As at 5:54 $\$ 5$.

1153 Compare with 5:101.

1154 This is Lāludāyī, often depicted as a presumptuous monk. Thus the Buddha's words to follow should probably be read as a reproach to him for prematurely setting himself up as a teacher. Other examples of Udāyı's rashness are at 3:80 and 5:166. At 6:29 and again at MN 136.6, III 208,25-31, he is reproached by the Buddha. In the Vinaya Pitaka a certain Udāyi is depicted as a licentious monk whose misbehavior in sexual matters was responsible for the laying down of several sanghädisesa rules, but it is questionable whether he is identical with this Udāyi. He may even have been a fictional character, a "John Doe" used to account for the origin of these rules.

1155 Ānupubbikatham kathessāmi. Mp: "One should teach the Dhamma to others after determining: 'I will first speak about giving, next about virtuous behavior, and next about heaven; or I will explain a sutta passage or verse in accordance with the order of its words.'"

1156 Pariyāyudassāvi. Mp: "Showing the reason (kärana) for this or that point."

1157 Yattha bhikkhuno uppainno āghāto sabbaso pativinetabbo. I interpret this following Mp, which explains: "When resentment has arisen in a bhikkhu in regard to some object (yattha ārammane), it should be completely dispelled there in these five ways." Thus Mp takes yattha to mean the person toward whom the resentment has arisen, not the physical place where it has arisen.

1158 Labhati ca kālena kālam cetaso vivaram cetaso pasādam. Mp: "From time to time he gains an opening of the mind, that is, an opportunity arises in his mind for serenity and insight, and he gains placidity, which consists in the achievement of faith" (kâle kâle samathavipassanācittassa uppannokāsasañkhātạ̣ vivarañceva saũdhāsampannabhāvasañkhātạ̣ pasādañca labhati).

1159 Samantapāsāatikam āvuso puggalam āgamma cittam pasīdati. This is apparently referring to the fifth type of person. Since his behavior and mind are both pure, one can easily dispel resentment toward him and settle down into a state of trust and tranquility.

1160 Mp: "The devas that subsist on edible food (kabafikārāhārabhakkhānaṃ devanan): the deities of the sense sphere. A certain mind-made group (aññataram manomayam käyan): a certain group of brahmās in the pure abodes, who are reborn by the jhāna-mind."

1161 Ye te, bhante, devā arūpino saññämaya. Udāyi has confused the devas of the formless realm, who are said to be perception-made (sañ̃̃amaya), with the devas of the form realm (including the pure abodes), who are said to be mind-made (manomaya).

1162 I read with Ce and Ee mayam te na pucchäma, as against Be mayam tena na muccāma.

1163 Yathā āyasmantamyev'ettha upavānam paṭibhāseyya. Mp explains
yatha as a word for a cause (käranavacanam). I take patibhāsati to mean "calls upon [someone to say something]" (see SED sv pratibhāsh). Mp continues: "When something has been uttered by the Blessed One with reference to this matter, you should think of some reply (pativacana, a counter-statement)."

1164 I follow Ce and Ee, which have na samvijjeyyum, kena nam sabrahmacärī sakkareyyum garukareyyum māneyyum pūjeyyum. Be has na samvijjeyyum, tam sabrahmacärī na sakkareyyum na garum kareyyum na māneyyum na pūjeyyum.

1165 No kālena kupitam. It seems strange that the text uses the word kupita to refer to being reproved at the proper time. Kupita normally suggests "disturbed, irritated, angered," and at the proper time it would be suitable to reprove him.

1166 Atthakusalo, dhammakusalo, niruttikusalo, byañjanakusalo, pubbāparakusalo. I follow the sequence of Ce. Be and Ee put byañjanakusalo before niruttikusalo. As stated, the first three terms obviously correspond to the first three patisambhidā knowledges. Perhaps the last two can be comprised under patibhünapatisambhidā. Mp explains five types of sequence: sequence of meaning (atthapubbāpara), sequence of Dhamma (dhammapubbāpara), sequence of syllables (akkharapubbāpara), sequence of phrasing (byañjanapubbāpara), and sequence of sections within a sutta (anusandhipubbāpara).

1167 I prefer Ce te santaññeva sukhitā sukham patisamvedenti to Be and Ee te santamyeva tusitā sukham pativedenti.

1168 Sameti kho idam āyasmato bhaddajissa, yadidam bahujjanena. I follow both Be and Ee, which punctuate this with a question mark. Although the sentence does not contain an interrogative, by putting the verb at the beginning it seems to imply a question rather than an assertion.

1169 Anantara āsavānam khayo hoti. On the "immediacy condition for the destruction of the taints," see p. 1705, note 851.

1170 Upāsakacandālo ca hoti upāsakamalañca upāsakapatikutṭho ca. The candālas were the lowest of the outcast groups.

1171 Ito ca bahiddhā dakkhineyyam gavessati. That is, outside the Buddhist monastic community. On the relative value of offerings in terms of merit, see MN 142.

1172 Upāsakaratanañca hoti upāsakapadumañca upāsakapuṇdarīkañca.

1173 Pavivekam pitim. Mp: "The rapture that arises based on the first and second jhānas."

1174 The plural "wives" is in the Pāli, schi dārehi santuttho.

1175 Be and Ee read arame, Ce nārame. DOP gives as meanings of aramati both "leaves off, keeps away (from)" and "delights in, takes pleasure" Hence the Be and Ee reading (which I follow) fits the former sense, the Ce reading the latter sense.

1176 Puññatthassa jigimsato. Mp glosses the line: puññena atthikassa
puññam gavesantassa. Jigimsati is desiderative of jayati, here with the sense "to wish to obtain."

1177 The verses to follow are identical with those of 3:57.

1178 Here and just below I read with Ce anuttaram vimuttisukham. Be and Ee have anuttaram vimuttim.

1179 Pāpiccho icchāpakato āraññiko hoti. Mp: "He thinks, 'While I am living in the forest, they will honor me with the four requisites, thinking I'm a forest dweller. They will esteem me for my virtues, thinking that I'm conscientious and secluded, and so forth.' Thus he is a forest dweller based on evil desire, because he is overcome by desire."

1180 Ce follows this with a sutta on "these five who live solely on food gathered on alms round" (pañc' ime bhikkhave pindapātikā), not included in Be and Ee. I here follow the latter, as Ce expands the vagga to an irregular eleven suttas. All these ascetic practices are explained in detail in Vism, chap. 2. Of those below that are not self-explanatory, the "sitter's practice" is sleeping in the sitting posture, without lying down; the "any-bed-user's practice" is accepting any sleeping place that is offered, without preferences; the "one-session practice" is eating all one's food for the day in one sitting posture, without consuming any food after one has risen from one's seat; and the "later-food-refuser's practice" is refusing to accept any food that may be offered and made available after one has started one's meal.

1181 Reading here with Be sampiyen'eva samvāsam sambandhāya sampavatenti. Ce and Ee have samsaggatthāya for sambandhāya. Mp (Be) seems to support the Be reading with its paraphrase: piyo piyam upasañkamitvā paveṇiyā bandhanattham samvāsam pavattayanti. Mp (Ce) has ganthanattham for bandhanattham. Sambandhāya is glossed paveniy $\bar{a}$, which may signify the continuity of the family.

1182 Be reads: . . . sampiyenapi samvāsam sambandhāya sampavatenti, which seems incomplete. Ee is similar in this respect. I follow Ce in positing here two contrasting clauses:...sampiyenapi samvāsam samsaggatthāyà sampavatenti, asampiyenapi samvāsam samsaggatthāya sampavatenti, but I would replace Ce samsaggatthāya with Be sambandhāya.

1183 This seems to have been a common criticism of the Buddha. See too 4:22 and 8:11.

1184 Komārabrahmacariyam. Presumably this means the celibacy of one who has always been a virgin.

1185 This passage suggests, contrary to a common assumption, that during the Buddha's time brahmins were not obliged to marry and adopt the life of a householder. While marriage later became
the norm for brahmins during the prime of life, it seems that in this period some brahmins, after completing their training, chose to renounce secular life even in their youth and maintained their renunciant status throughout their lives. On celibate brahmin ascetics, see Samuel 2008:122-23, 154-65.

1186 Cattāro brahmavihāre bhāvetva. This is one of the few places in the Nikāyas where the word brahmavihāra is used to designate these four meditations collectively. Wherever the word is used in the Nikāyas, it immediately precedes the practitioner's rebirth in the brahmā world.

1187 I read with Ce and Ee asucipatipito, as against Be asucipatipitito, "would be oppressed by the impure substance."

1188 Ce and Ee read: Sace dona brähmano anutunim gacchati, tassa sa hoti brähmanī n'eva kāmatthā na davatthā na ratatthā, pajatthāva brähmanassa brähmanī hoti. This reading, it seems, joins the premise of the hypothetical to the consequence of the alternative (that is, when the brahmin has relations with his wife only when she is in season). I follow Brahmāli's suggestion to delete sace dona brähmano anutunim gacchati, which leaves a text that makes good sense. Be does not have the question about why the brahmin couples with a woman only when she is in season, but follows the statement that he does not couple with a nursing woman with the words: tassa sa hoti brähmanī n'eva kämattha na davattha na ratattha, pajatthāva brāhmanassa brāhmanī hoti. It seems that, in this reading, a clause has been lost.

1189 Reading with Be and Ee pajatthapi, as against Ce na pajatthāva.

1190 I assume the text (in all three editions) should be corrected to read na kevalam bhikkhacariyaya rather than kevalam pi bhikkhācariyaya.

1191 Also at SN 46:55, V 121-26, but with a section on the seven factors of enlightenment.

1192 Mp interprets the escape from the hindrances by way of the threefold escape. In relation to the hindrance of sensual desire, escape by suppression (vikkhambhananissarana) occurs through the first jhāna based on the unattractive nature of the body, escape in a particular respect (tadañganissarana) through insight, and escape by eradication (samucchedanissarana) through the path of arahantship (broadly interpreting kamacchanda as craving for any object). (ii) The escape from ill will occurs by suppression through the first jhana based on loving-kindness, and by eradication through the path of the non-returner. (iii) The escape from dullness and drowsiness occurs by suppression through the perception of light (the visualization of a bright light) and by eradication through the path of arahantship. (iv) The escape
from restlessness and remorse occurs by suppression through serenity-remorse being then eradicated through the path of the non-returner and restlessness through the path of arahantship. And (v) the escape from doubt occurs by suppression through the defining of phenomena (dhammavavatthāna; see Vism 587-93, Ppn 18.3-24) and by eradication through the path of streamentry. Mp does not apply "escape in a particular respect" to the last four hindrances, but Mp-t says it occurs in that the hindrances can be dispelled by reflection (patisankhänavasena tassa vinodetabbatāya tadañganissaranampi labbhat'eva).

1193 Mp interprets these terms from a monastic perspective. One's own good (attattha) is arahantship, and the good of others (parattha) is the welfare of the lay supporters who provide one with material support (because the offering of such gifts creates merit).

1194 Mp explains that after rising early, he had new gates, a watchtower, and ramparts built and had those that had decayed repaired.

1195. Mp identifies Pingiyāni as a brahmin who was a noble disciple established in the fruit of non-returning (anägämiphale patitthitam ariyasavakam brähmanam). His daily routine was to visit the Buddha and offer him incense and garlands. At the time the sutta begins, he was returning from his daily visit.

1196 For some reason, he cites only four of the nine divisions of the Dhamma. Perhaps it was only these with which he was familiar, or perhaps this implies a later provenance for the others.

1197 Paṭibhātu tam pingiyānī. Lit., "Let it shine upon you, Pingiyāni."

1198 At SN 3:12, I 81, this verse is spoken by the lay follower Candanañgalika, who also recites it after being moved by a sudden surge of inspiration. In the verse, Angirasa is an epithet of the Buddha.

1199 The following as at 5:143 above.

1200 I have added "this was a foretoken" in compliance with Mp's use of the word pubbanimitta to characterize the significance of the dreams. Brahmāli suggests: "[the dream] ... represented his awakening to the unsurpassed, perfect enlightenment," with a parallel construction for the corresponding sections below.

1201 Tassa abhisambodhāya ayaṃ paṭhamo mahāsupino pāturahosi. Brahmāli suggests here: "This was the first great dream that was beneficial for his awakening," again with a parallel construction for the corresponding sections below. The sentence as it stands is perplexing; yet Mp does not comment and there is no Chinese parallel. Ce and Be read tassa for tassa (the Ee reading). Tassa would have to represent sammā sambodhi in the previous
sentence, but the question would then arise what abhisambodhāya relates to in $\S \S 2-4$, where sammā sambodhi does not occur. I find the sentence is more intelligible if we read tassa (as in the following sections), taking it to mean "to him," that is, to the future Buddha. We can then see the whole sentence as affirming that the dream was indicative of his imminent awakening.

1202 Ce and Be yattha nemittānam cakkhu na kamati (Ee na kkhamati). The Pāli itself mixes metaphors.

1203 Pabbajita. Elsewhere I have usually rendered pabbajita as "one who has gone forth," and occasionally as "monk." Here, to avoid an unwieldy "virtuous ones who have gone forth," and to keep the rendering gender-neutral, I use "monastics." "Home" renders kula, lit. "family," but in this context the former better conveys the sense.

1204 Nissāranīya dhātuyo. Mp glosses nissaranīya with visamyutta, "detached, disconnected," and dhātuyo with attasun̄ñasabhāvā, "a nature empty of self."

1205 Mp : "Having emerged from jhāna on an unattractive object, he sends his mind in the direction of sensual pleasures for the purpose of investigating them, just as one might take an antidote for the purpose of investigating a poison." Mp-t: "Such a bhikkhu does not attend to sensual pleasures in the sense [that he is overcome] by the defilement. Rather, he investigates: 'My mind is now fixed in renunciation. Why do sensual thoughts arise?'"

1206 Though all three editions here read vimuccati, Mp glosses the word with adhimuccati. The latter makes better sense to me. The manuscript traditions, as well as printed editions, show irregular variations between these two readings throughout the Nikāyas.

1207 I read with Ce and Be sugatam, as against Ee sukataṃ. The former has the support of Mp, which glosses "well departed because it has gone into the object" (gocare gatattā sutthu gataṃ). I believe, however, that the sense of sugatam is that the mind has gone away from the defilement, which ties up better with the notion of escape (nissarana).

1208 Na so tam vedanam vediyati. Mp: "He does not feel that sensual feeling or that distressful and feverish feeling."

1209 Be and Ee read veluvane, Ce niceluvane. Mp (Be) has niculavane in the lemma, glossed as mucalindavane. Both PED and SED list nicula as a kind of tree, identified as Barringtonia acutangula.

1210 It cannot be determined from the language of the text whether Kimbila's questions and the Buddha's replies refer to the general conditions under which the teaching of a Buddha disappears, or to the conditions under which the Buddha Gotama's teaching
will disappear. Mp seems to support the former interpretation. It explains that Kimbila had become a monk in the time of the past Buddha Kassapa, during an era when the latter's teaching was in decline. He now recollected this past life and wanted to inquire from the present Buddha about the cause for the decline of the Dhamma. Brahmäli disagrees with me about this and writes: "This [translation] seems to assume that Kimbila is thinking in cosmic terms, about Tathägatas as a type of being. But it seems more likely to me that he was concerned specifically with what would happen after Gotama Buddha passed away."

1211 An expanded parallel of 4:112.

1212 As at MN 16.2-7, I 101.

1213 Cetokhila. In MLDB cetokhila was translated "wilderness of the heart," which is not satisfactory. According to DOP, khila means "barren land; hard, arid soil," and "(as a fault of one's thinking) barrenness, sterility; stiffness, rigidity; hostility, resistance." Mp glosses: "Rigidity, waste, stumps of the mind" (cittassa thaddhabhäva kacavarabhāva khāṇukabhāvā).

1214 As at MN 16.8-12, I 101-2.

1215 Cetaso vinibandhā. Mp: "They grasp the mind, having shackled it as if in a fist, therefore they are called 'bondages of the mind'" (cittam vinibandhitva mutṭhiyam katvā viya ganhantī ti cetaso vinibandhā).

1216 Dantakatthassa akhädane, lit. "in not chewing on toothwood." In the Buddha's time people cleaned their teeth by brushing them with sticks of medicinal wood such as neem, sharpened at one end and made brush-like at the base. This practice is still observed in rural India as well as in monasteries in southern Asia.

1217 Ayatakena gitassarena dhamman bhanantassa. Vin II 108,5-25 tells the origin story that leads to the laying down of the rule.

1218 Mutthassatissa asampajānassa niddam okkamayato. Also at Vin I 295,14-24.

1219 Chinnaparipantho. Mp explains that he has cut off the worldtranscending outlet (lokuttaraparipanthassa chinnattā chinnaparipantho), but possibly what is meant is that, having committed a $p \bar{a} r a ̄ j i k a$, which requires expulsion from the Sangha, he has no way to preserve his status as a bhikkhu.

1220 Aññataram sañkilittham āpattim āpajjati. This sometimes means that he commits a pārājika or a sanghādisesa offense, but since a pārājika was just mentioned, it must refer to a sanghādisesa.

1221 Verabahulo. Mp: "One has much enmity, both in the form of people who are enemies and as unwholesome [mental] enmity" (puggalaverenapi akusalaverenapi bahuvero).

1222 The exact meaning of pasidati cannot easily be captured by a single English word. "To be confident" normally suggests to be poised and self-confident, which is not what is meant. SED gives as meanings of Skt pra-sad, pra-stdati, "to settle down, grow clear and bright, become placid or tranquil; . . . to become satisfied or pleased or glad." SED renders the causative pra-sädayati: "to make clear, purify; to make serene, gladden (the heart); to render calm, sooth, appease." Of these meanings, "to gladden, to please" partly captures the impact that pasädika conduct has on others; becoming "gladdened" or "pleased" is how an observer might favorably respond to such conduct. But such conduct also awakens in others trust in oneself as a spiritually refined person and inspires confidence in the teaching one follows. Thus such conduct "inspires confidence" in others. When one's behavior or attitudes act reflexively upon oneself, one "becomes serene (or placid)," which is the best way to render the sense of the verb pasidati.

1223 The capital of the state of Suraseña, situated on the Yamuna River in northern India. It later became an important center for the Mūlasarvästivädins. Though the text makes the Buddha say he did not like the place, one wonders whether this sutta might be an interpolation inserted by the Vibhajjavädins to denigrate the headquarters of their rival Buddhist school.

1224 Dighacärikaṃ anavatthacärikaṃ. Mp glosses the latter with avavatthitacärikaṃ, perhaps "undetermined (or purposeless) wandering." The contrast is with samavatthacäre just below, glossed samavatthitacäre, "evenly determined wandering."

1225 The first four are violations, respectively, of Pācittiyas 46, 45, 44, and 7 .

1226 On the defiled offense, see p. 1733, note 1089.

1227 Ussūrabhatte kule. Ussūra is from Skt utsūra (SED: "the time when the sun sets, the evening"). Mp glosses "a meal cooked late in the day" (atidivāpacanabhatte).

1228 Samayabhatte kule. To suit ascetics and brahmins who "abstain from meals outside the proper time," the food would need to be ready well before midday.

1229 See pp. 60-61, for a discussion of misogynistic passages in AN.

1230 The first two "dangers" are evidently taken to be selfexplanatory.

1231 Dhammadassane niveseti. Mp: "He establishes them in the seeing of the Dhamma of the four [noble] truths."

1232 Arahaggaṭaṃ āyasmanto satim upatṭhāpetha. Mp: "Establish respect for the three bases [of faith], gone [for refuge] only to the Triple Gem, which is worthy of all honors." The texts occasionally use
āyasmanto as an address of monks to laypeople. Apparently the word could be used to address anyone considered worthy of esteem and was not solely an honorific for monks.

1233 This is one of the penalties to be observed by those who have committed a sanghädisesa offense.

1234 The ellipsis points in the Pāli may give the impression that in $\S 3$ and $\S 4$ the devoted person loses confidence in bhikkhus. However, since the person in whom he had confidence was not penalized in any way by other bhikkhus, it is clear that the statement about the devoted person losing his confidence in bhikkhus does not pertain to these two sections. That is, the continuation of $\S 5$ should be applied retroactively to $\S 3$ and $\S 4$ as well. He does not associate with other bhikkhus, not out of resentment toward them, but simply because of the exclusivity of his trust.

1235 From this vagga on, the text no longer includes uddāna verses. I thus translate the sutta titles at the head of each sutta in Ce.

1236 For various sets of five qualities that entitle a monk to give full ordination, to give dependence, and to have a novice attend on him, see Vin I 62-65.

1237 On nissaya, see pp. 1732-33, note 1085.

1238 Ce and Be patikitham. Be patikuttham, past participle of patikkosati.

1239 I follow the arrangement of Be and Ee. Ce places the two versions on the jhānas before the two versions on the four fruits.

1240 Vaggātirekasuttāni. This is the title Ce assigns to this entire concluding section. Be does not assign a general title but classifies these extra suttas into three "repetition series" (peyyāla), numbered 1,2 , and 3 . The first, referring to the first sutta in each set, is called Sammutipeyyālam, "Agreed Upon Repetition Series." I use both the general title of Ce and the separate series titles of Be . Be does not give any separate title to this section, whether to the whole or to its separate series.

1241 Bhattuddesaka. See Vin II 175,36-76. The procedures for appointing officials of the Sangha, and their respective tasks, are discussed in detail in Thānissaro 2007b: 323-57.

1242 I translate in accordance with Be and Ee. A translation from Ce would read: "Bhikkhus, one possessing five qualities should not be appointed an assigner of meals. If he is appointed, he should not be sent."

1243 Senāsanapaññāpaka. On his qualifications, see Vin II 176,9-14. Dabba Mallaputta's duties as senāsanapaññāpaka are described at Vin III 158-60. The qualifications of the officers to follow here, except the next, are described at Vin II 176-77.

1244 Senāsanaggāhāpaka. This official is missing in Ee. It is unclear to me how the senāsanaggāhāpaka differs from the senāsanapaññāpaka.

Thānissaro, too, observes (2007b: 340): "The Canon allows for two officials related to lodgings: the lodging bestower (senāsanagāhāpaka) and the lodging assignor (senāsana-paññapanaka). Neither the Canon nor Commentary clearly distinguishes between the duties of the two."

1245 Abrahamacārī hoti. Though modeled after the five lay precepts, the third item in this list lays down the more stringent requirement of celibacy for male and female monastics.

1246 Abrahamacariyā pativirato hoti.

1247 Kāmesu micchācārinī. For the lay Buddhist the rule of celibacy incumbent on monastics is changed to abstaining from sexual misconduct (kāmesu micchācāra).

1248 A sect of ascetics contemporary with the Buddha. Makkhali Gosāla is regarded as their founder, or perhaps simply one of their prominent teachers. While the text stipulates conditions for the non-Buddhist ascetics to go to hell, it mentions none that will enable them to be reborn in heaven.

1249 In regard to the magandika and the following, Mp says only that they are types of sectarians (titthiyā). I am uncertain which of these terms designate a specific religious school and which designate only a mode of practice. Hence I use initial capitals only for those that are known to designate religious schools contemporary with the Buddha.

1250 Be gives the final number as 1151, but the sum total of suttas in this peyyala should be 850: five major sections, taken by ten modes of treatment (direct knowledge, full understanding, etc.) in relation to seventeen defilements (lust, hatred, etc.). Thus, starting at 303, the final number should be 1152.

# Notes to the Sixes

1251 N'eva sumano hoti na dummano, upekkhako viharati sato sampajāno. Mp: "Neither joyful nor saddened: [filled] with joy accompanied by lust in regard to a desirable object. Nor [is he] saddened: [filled] with sadness accompanied by aversion in regard to an undesirable object. But [he] dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending: He is not equanimous because he has fallen into the 'equanimity of unknowing' (aññān'upekkhā) through apathy in the case of a neutral object; but rather, being mindful and clearly comprehending, he maintains neutrality in relation to the object. In this sutta, the constant dwelling of an arahant is discussed."

1252 For details on the first five mundane direct knowledges, see Vism chaps. 12 and 13.

1253 See 5:139, where the same simile is stated of a king's bull elephant.

1254 Elaborated below at 6:30.

1255 Elaborated just below at 6:10 and again at 6:25.

1256 Ariyasāvako āgataphalo viññātasāsano. Mp says that Mahānāma is asking about the stream-enterer's vital support (sotāpannassa nissayavihāram).

1257 The six recollections to follow are commented on in detail in Vism chap. 7.

1258 Visamagatāya pajāya samappatto. Mp: "Among beings who have become unbalanced (visamagatesu) through lust, hatred, and delusion, he has attained peace and calmness (saman upasamam patto hutvä)." From this, it is obvious that Mp takes Pāli sama to be equivalent to Skt śama, peace. But since the text establishes a contrast between visama, the imbalance (or unrighteousness) in which ordinary people live, and the sama that the noble disciple has attained, it is more likely that Pāli sama corresponds to Skt sama. Two Chinese parallels support this supposition. SĀ ${ }^{2} 156$, at T II 432c15-16, has 想家及已眠族。於此二人。無怨憎想。心常平等 ("Whether his enemies or his relatives, toward these two types of people he has no thought of hostility but his.mind is balanced"). The other, T 1537.8 at T XXVI 492c13-15, has 於不平等諸有情類。得住平等。於有慍害諸有情類。住無慍害 ("Amid unbalanced sentient beings, he obtains balance; among afflicted sentient beings he dwells without affliction"). Though contradicting the interpretation of sama offered by Mp , this confirms the evident meaning of the sutta.

1259 Dhammasotam samāpanno. Mp: "He has entered the stream of the Dhamma consisting in insight." Since the Pāli expression can easily be contracted to sotāpanna, I do not see why Mp interprets dhammasota as insight (vipassanā) rather than the noble path (ariyamagga). In SN 55:5, at V 347,24-25, sota is used as a metaphor for the noble eightfold path.

1260 The first six are the deities of the six sense-sphere heavens. The devas of Brahmā's company (brahmakāyika devā) are the deities of the brahmā world. The "devas still higher than these" are the higher devas in the form and formless realms.

1261 Dhammā sārañiya. Mp explains sārañiyā as if it meant "fit to be remembered" (saritabbayuttaka), but Edgerton, in BHSD (p. 593), regards samrañjana, samrañjanīya, "courteous, pleasing, polite, friendly," as the correct Skt equivalent. Five of these are at 5:105, where they are called "means of dwelling at ease" (phāsuvīhārā).

1262 Appativibhattabhogī. Mp explains that there are two kinds of reservation (dve pativibhattāni), regarding things and regarding persons. Reservation regarding things means that one decides
to give away so much and keep so much for oneself. Reservation regarding persons means that one decides to give to one person but not to another. The bhikkhu described here does not make either of these reservations.

1263 Nissāraṇtyā dhātuyo. Compare 5:200, which describes a different set of "elements of escape."

1264 Arati. This word usually signifies dissatisfaction with the life of renunciation.

1265. This text uses the word rāga, which in this context probably means personal bias rather than sensual desire. Interestingly, at MN I 424,33-34, upekkhā is opposed to patigha, aversion, the polar opposite of rāga. Given that upekkhā is a state of inner poise beyond both attraction and repulsion, it is not surprising to find it offered as the antidote to the two opposed qualities.

1266 Animittā cetovimutti. Mp: "The markless liberation of mind: strong insight (balavavipassana). But the reciters of the Digha Nikāya say it is the meditative attainment of the fruit of arahantship (arahattaphalasamäpatti); for that is said to be markless because it lacks the marks of lust, etc., the marks of form, etc., and the marks of permanence, etc. (sā hi rāganimittädinañc'eva rūpanimittadīnañca niccanimittädinañca abhāvā animittā ti vuttā).

1267 Nimittānusārī. Mp: "Follows after marks: follows along with the aforesaid marks." The "aforesaid marks" are those mentioned in the preceding note.

1268 In the standard correlation between stages of attainment and removal of defilements, doubt and bewilderment along with the view "This I am" are eliminated with the attainment of streamentry, and the conceit "I am" with the attainment of arahantship (see SN 22:89, III 126-32). In the present passage, the persistence of doubt is taken as a criterion for determining that someone has not removed the conceit "I am."

1269 Vihāram kappeti. Lit., "arranges his dwelling." Kappeti, as suggesting a way to pass time, occurs in such expressions as jivitam kappeti, "to make a living," vāsam kappeti, "to make a dwelling, to dwell," nisajjam kappeti, "to take a seat, to sit down," etc.

1270 Na bhaddakam maranam hoti, no bhaddikā kālakiriya. Pāli often pairs two words for death, marana and kalakiriya. Since such a manner of expression sounds odd in English, I use one word. Mp says that what is meant by "not a good death" is rebirth in the plane of misery (apāye patisandhim ganhāti).

1271 Kammārāmo hoti kammarato kammārāmatam anuyutto. In this context, kamma means construction work, common at monasteries, such as putting up new buildings and renovating existing facilities.

1272 Papañcārāmo hoti papañcarato papañcāramatam anuyutto. Mp says: "Proliferation is the proliferation of defilements, occurring by way of craving, views, and conceit and inducing intoxication" (papañco ti taṇhādiṭthimānavasena pavatto madanākārasaṇthito kilesapapañco). For more on papañca, see pp. 1710-11, note 881.

1273 Sakkäya. Mp: "The round of existence with its three planes" (tebhümakavattam).

1274 Mago. Lit., "a beast." Mp: "One like a beast" (magasadiso).

1275 Säpekkho. Mp glosses this with sataṇho, "with craving," but I believe the intended meaning is more likely to be "with anxiety, with worry, with sorrow." Pāli apekkhā, like "concern," can mean both attachment and worry.

1276 Mp says that since she was not able to cure his illness with medicine, she roared this "lion's roar" (sihanäda) to cure his illness by a declaration of truth (saccakiriyā).

1277 I read with Ce varam, as against Be and Ee gharam. Mp: "will take another husband" (aññam sāmikam ganhissati). See SED sv vara: "'chooser,' one who solicits a girl in marriage, suitor, lover, bridegroom, husband."

1278 Gahatṭhakam brahmacariyam. It is not unusual in traditional Buddhist cultures for devout couples who have begotten several children to mutually agree to observe celibacy.

1279 Since the structure of this section is parallel to the two that follow rather than to the three that precede it, it is evident that mam'accayena does not belong here. Though the expression is in all three printed editions, a Sinhala-script manuscript noted in Fe omits it. Like the two following sections, this one does not have a future verb bhavissati. Further, parallel to the next two sections, Nakulamātā here asserts that she presently fulfills virtuous behavior, referring one who doubts this to the Buddha. Hence, since Nakulamātā is speaking about a current fact, there is no need for her to refer to a time when her husband has passed away. Mp says that $\S \S 4-6$ are Nakulamātā's declaration of truth.

1280 Na . . . imasmim dhammavinaye ogādhappattā patigādhappattā assāsappattā. These are all ways of asserting that she is at minimum a stream-enterer. It is interesting that she claims to have obtained a foothold in the dhammavinaya, which suggests that in certain contexts vinaya bears a wider meaning than the code of monastic regulations.

1281 Yāvadattham seyyasukham passasukham middhasukham anuyutto viharanto. At 5:206 this is called a mental bondage (cetaso vinibandha).

1282 Also at 5:56.

1283 It is interesting to note that mindfulness of death culminates in the deathless.

1284 Mp explains the opening exclamation, aho vata, as an indeclinable expressive of longing (patthanatthe nipāto). Brahmāli rejects Mp's interpretation and regards the sentence as an emphatic statement of fact, which he renders: "Indeed, I may live just a night and a day; I should attend to the Blessed One's teaching." The Chinese parallel, EĀ 40.8 (T I 741 c26-742b2), is in substantial agreement with Mp. Thus the first monk to speak (at T 1742a2-3) says: "When I contemplate death, I wish to go on living for seven days [and] contemplate the seven factors of enlightenment. This would be very beneficial [to me] in regard to the Tathāgàta's teaching [and] after death I will have no regrets" (思惟死想時。筧欲存七日。思惟七覺竟。於如來法中多所饒益。死後無恒).

1285 Bahum vata me katam assa. Mp: "I could accomplish much in my task with respect to the teaching" (sāsane mama kiccam bahu katam assa). Mp-t: "I would accomplish much in my task as a monk, which would be beneficial to me."

1286 Mp-t: "A single alms meal: a single alms meal able to sustain him for a single day." The point of the Pāli locution tadantaram.... yadantaram is not that he wants to live long enough to eat a single meal, but that, aware of the uncertainty of death's arrival, he wants to live for the length of time it takes to eat a single meal so that he can practice the Dhamma. In other words, if it takes twenty minutes to silently eat a meal, this is the length of time he hopes to live.

1287 Rattiyā patihitāya. Patihita (or patihita) is not in PED; see SED sv prati-dhā. It is the past participle of patidahati, meaning "to commence, to begin, to approach," which seems relevant here. Mp glosses with patipannaya.

1288 I read with Be parihāyamāne, as against Ce and Ee parihānāya samvattamāne.

1289 These eight lines are also at 3:36. Here all three editions read te khemappattā in pāda a of the final verse.

1290 The text uses the singular himavantam pabbatarājam. To conform to ordinary English usage I translate himavantam as "the Himalayas," despite apparent tension between the plural object and the singular "the king of mountains."

1291 Mp: "He is skilled in the attainment of concentration (samādhissa samāpattikusalo): he is skilled in entering concentration, having comprehended what kind of food and climate is suitable. Skilled in the duration of concentration (samādhissa thitikusalo): he is able to stabilize concentration. Skilled in emergence (samādhissa vutthánakusalo): he is able to emerge at the predetermined time. Skilled in fitness for concentration (samadhissa kallitakusalo): he is
able to gladden the mind for concentration, to make it fit. Skilled in the area [or resort] of concentration (samädhissa gocarakusalo): having avoided those things that are unsuitable and unhelpful for concentration, pursuing those that are suitable and helpful, he knows, 'This concentration takes a mark as its object; this one takes a characteristic as its object.' Skilled in resolution regarding concentration (samädhissa abhinīhārakusalo): in order to enter higher and higher meditative attainments, he is able to direct [the mind] to the concentration of the first jhāna and so forth." Mp-t adds more information on these skills: "Skilled in fitness: able to make the mind enter [concentration] by removing the. states that are opposed and by evenly applying the collaborative causes of concentration. Skilled in the area: skilled in what is to be done to produce concentration; skilled in the place where it occurs, namely, the meditation subject; and skilled in yoking mindfulness and clear comprehension to the area for going on alms round. Skilled in resolution: able to direct or lead [the mind] to the concentration of the first jhāna, etc., because they pertain to distinction." For more on the skills needed to master concentration, see 7:40-41 and SN chap. 34.

1292 Mp glosses anussatitthānāni with anussatikāraṇāni, "causes of recollection," on which Mp-t says: "The recollections are themselves 'causes of recollection' in that they function as the cause (hetubhāvato) for the welfare and happiness pertaining to this present life and the future life."

1293 Idampi kho bhikkhave ārammanam karitvä. In the Nikāyas the word arammaṇa does not yet mean "object of consciousness" in the general sense, as it does in the Abhidhamma and commentaries. Occasionally in the Nikāyas ārammana may signify an object of meditation, but this role is usually taken by nimitta, which does not necessarily mean the "counterpart sign" as it does in the commentaries. I do not interpret the present text to be saying that one takes the recollection of the Buddha as an object, but that one makes it a basis, or starting point, for departing from greed. For this, I draw support from Mp-t, which glosses ārammanam karitvä thus: "Having made it a condition, having made it a foundation" (paccayam karitvā pādakaṃ katvā). Mp-t takes "this" (idam) in the lemma above to be the access concentration (upacārajjhāna) obtained by recollection of the Buddha. Mp explains "are purified" (visujjhanti) to mean "they attain final nibbāna, the supreme purity."

1294 Mp: "In the midst of confinement (sambādhe): amid confinement in the five objects of sensual pleasure. Has discovered the open-
ing. (okāsadhigamo): the opening is the six subject of recollection, which he has discovered."

1295 Where the preceding suita reads idh'ekacce sattā visujjhanti, the present one has idh' ekacce sattā visuddhidhammā bhavanti. There is no difference in the meaning.

1296 Manobhāvanīyassa bhikkhu-mo dassanāya upasañkamituṃ. The commentaries consistently explain manubhāvanīya to mean "those who increase esteem," or "those worthy of esteem," rather than "those who have developed the mind." Thus Spk II 250,1-2 says those bhikkhus are manobhāvanīya "who, when seen, make the mind grow in the wholesome" (yesu hiditthesu kusalavasena cittam vaddhati).

1297. Yam nimittam agamma yam nimittam manasikaroto anantara asavannam kinayo hoti. On the "immediate destruction of the taints," see p. 1705 , note 851 .

1298. Mp: "On that occasion when he is sitting in his daytime dwelling it occurs in his mind door."

1299 Adhicittam. Mp: "The mind of concentration and insight." The bhikkhu Udāyī (Lāludāyī) often blunders in his explanation of doctrinal points and is then reproached by the Buddha.

1300 Ironically, this may be the only place in the Nikāyas where three jhānas are referred to as an anussatitthāna, "subject of recollection." Neither text nor Mp offers an explanation why the fourth jhāna is set off as a separate subject of recollection, the fifth here. In fact, the use of the designation anussatitthāna for the five contemplations mentioned by Ānanda, and the sixth added by the Buddha, seems unique to this sutta.

1301 Yathā divā tathā rattim, yathā rattim tathā divā. Also at 4:41. Mp explains: "As by day he attends to the perception of light, just so does he attend to it at night. As at night he attends to the perception of light, just so does he attend to it during the day. Obtaining knowledge and vision: this is obtaining the divine eye, called knowledge and vision."

1302 Here and below are the nine charnel ground contemplations, as in the Satipatṭhāna Sulta, at DN 22.7-10, II 295-97; MN 10.12-30, I 58-59.

1303 This must be referring to the fourth jhana as the basis for the six kinds of direct knowledge.

1304 In Pāli: dassanānuttariyam, savanānuttariyam, lābhānuttariyam, sikkhānuttariyam, pāricariyanuttariyam, anussatānuttariyam.

1305 Patisanthāra. At 2:152 it is said that there are two kinds of hospitality: with material things and with the Dhamma.

1306 These last three perceptions are explained at 10:60 $\S \S 5-7$.

1307 Ācamayitvāna. Mp explains this literally: one washes one's hands and feet and cleans one's mouth.

1308 Natthi attakaro, natthi parakaro. Lit., "There is no self-doing, there is no other-doing." The Buddha refutes him just below by pointing out the obvious fact that the brahmin has come of his own free will (sayami) and will depart of his own free will.

1309 Ārambhadhātu. Mp: "The energy that occurs by way of beginning [an activity]" (arabhanavasena pavatiaviriyaṃ). The next two elements mentioned just below, nikkamadhātu and parakkamadhātu, can be understood respectively as the energy needed to persist in an action and to consummate it. The three are proposed as the antidote to dullness and drowsiness at 1:18 and SN 46:51, V $105,28-106,2$, and as means of nurturing the enlightenment factor of energy at SN 46:2, V 66,9-15, and SN 46:51, V 104,14-20.

1310 Mp does not differentiate the next three factors mentioned here-thāmadhātu, thitidhātu, and upakkamadhātu-but says merely that they are various names for energy.

1311 An expanded parallel of 5:201.

1312 See 5:30. Although the framework of the two suttas is the same, their content is so different that it is questionable whether the present suita can be considered an expanded parallel of the other.

1313 I read with Ce ārāmiko vā samamuddeso vā sahadhammiko vā. Neither Be nor Ee includes sahadhammiko vā. Be's reading here is very different: idān' imam āyasmantạ̣ ārāmiko vā upaṭ̣hahissati samanuddeso vā tam tamhā samādhimhā cāvessati; "Now a monastery attendant or a novice will serve this venerable one, which will cause him to fall away from that concentration." Ee follows Be, but with ghattessati, "strike against, offend, provoke," instead of upaṭthahissati.

1314 Araññasaññamyeva manasi karissati ekattam. Mp: "Oneness: he will bring to mind just the perception of the forest, a one-pointed state of uniformity" (ekasabhāvaṃ, ekaggatābhūtāṃ araññasaññam yeva citte karissati). The wording here is reminiscent of MN 121, III 104,20-21: araññasaññam pațicca manasi karoti ekattam, "he attends to the oneness dependent on the perception of the forest."

1315 Mp: "By this much, the Teacher has praised a forest lodging."

1316 The various applications of the word nāga will be explained just below. King's Pasenadi's bull elephant was called "Seta" ("White") because its body was white.

1317 A pun is intended here. The Buddha's statement-āguṃ na karoti-playfully derives the word nāga from $n a+\bar{a} g u m$, "no evil." Nāga thus becomes an epithet for the Buddha, or, more broadly, for any arahant. See Sn 527: Āguṃ na karoti kiñci loke ... nāgo tādi pavuccate tathattā ("One who does no evil in the world
... the stable one is for such a reason called a nāga"). See too Th 1249 (=SN.8:8, I 192,34): Nāganämo'si bhagavā ("You are named Nāga, O Blessed One").

1318 Mp identifies this Udāyī with Kāludāyī. However, the same verses at Th 689-704 are ascribed simply to Udāyī, while a different set of verses in Th (527-36) is ascribed to Kāludāyī. This proves that Mp's identification of the poet cannot be correct. There is a Chinese parallel of this sutta, MĀ 118 (at T I 608b2-609a3), which at several points proved helpful in my reading of the Pāli verses.

1319 Reading with Be vanā nibbanam āgataṃ. Ce and Ee have nibbānam in place of nibbanam. Mp draws out the word play: "From the jungle of defilements, he has come to a clearing; he has reached nibbāna, devoid of the jungle of defilements" (kilesavanato. nibbanam kilesavanarahitam nibbānam āgataṃ sampattam). It seems that Ce and Ee have transposed nibbāna from the gloss into the text itself. The Chinese at T I 608c2 has 於林雕林去, "from the woods he has left the woods," which supports the Be reading.

1320 Saccañamo is not "one whose name is truth," but "one who is truly named," whose name truly corresponds to his being. Mp: "He is truly named, really named, accurately named 'nāga' just because of not doing evil" (tacchanāmo bhūtanāmo āgum akaraneneva nāgoti evam avitathanāmo). The Chinese (at T I 608c7) has 一切龍中龍, 真諦無上龍, "he is the nāga among all nāgas, in truth the nāga who is unsurpassed."

1321 There is a word play here between two meanings of carana, "conduct, behavior" and "feet." Mp glosses: "They are the Buddhanāga's two hind feet."

1322 Sati gīva siro pañña vīmamsa dhammacintana. I translate the terms quite literally. Mp, however, says: "The tip of the elephant's trunk is called investigation (vīmamsa) because [it investigates] things to determine whether they are hard or soft, edible or inedible, etc. He then rejects whatever should be rejected and takes whatever should be taken. So, for the Buddha-nāga, reflection on phenomena (dhammacintana)-referring to his knowledge that determines the classes of phenomena-is his [means of] investigation. With this knowledge he knows who is capable and who incapable." The Chinese at 608 cII renders the line in a more straightforward way: 智慧顕思惟分別法, "wisdom is his head, reflection on and discrimination of phenomena."

1323 In pāda c I read samātapo with Be and Ee, as against Ce samāvāpo. Mp: "It is the concentration of the fourth jhāna that is here called dhamma. For it is on this basis that the supernormal powers succeed. Therefore it is called balanced heat of the belly (kucchisamätapo). Seclusion (viveka) refers to bodily seclusion, mental seclusion, and
seclusion from the acquisitions (kayacittaupadhiviveko). As the elephant uses its tail to ward off mosquitoes, so the Tathāgata resorts to seclusion to ward off householders and monks." The Chinese reads the couplet (at 608c12) as 受持諸法服，策逼離壁臂， "upholding dharmas is his belly, and delight in seclusion is his pair of arms." Apparently in this transmission, walaāhi of the Pāli came down as bähüni.

1324 Assāsa can mean both inhalation and consolation, the latter referring to arahantship. Mp says that just as inhalation and exhalation are what keeps the elephant alive, so fruition attainment (phalasamäpatti) is essential to the Buddha, and it is there that he delights.

1325 Reading with Be loke viharati. Ce and Ee loke virajjati means "becomes detached in the world," which does not match the simile as well.

1326 In place of san்khāresüpasantesu in pāda c (the reading of all three editions), I read here with a pair of Burmese manuscripts (referred to in a note in Ee): añgāresu ca santesu, nibbutoti pavuccati. The reading is also found at Th 702. Vanarata points out that "the whole verse is the simile and nibbuto [meaning both an extinguished fire and a person who has attained nibbāna] refers to the fire." The Chinese (at 608c27), in agreement with Th and the Burmese manuscripts, has 無斬火不傳，此火調之滅，"Without firewood, the fire does not continue. This fire is then said to have ceased."

1327 Mp: "Other arahant nāgas will know the Buddha-nāga that was taught by the nāga, the elder Udāyī." Despite Mp, I suspect the text itself intends the Buddha himself as the one who taught about the nāga. The Chinese (at 608c29) supports my suspicion: 微中微所說，"it was spoken by the nāga among nāgas.".

1328 Reading with Ee parinibbāti 'nāsavo, as against Ce and Be parinibbissati anāsavo. This verse completes the simile with the fire. The analogy is clearer in the Chinese (at 609a2), where 此微調之滅， "this nāga is said to have attained nibbāna," echoes 608c27, 此火調之滅，"this fire is said to have ceased." I have attempted to capture this effect by translating parinibbāti twice, first as quenched and then in terms of its doctrinal meaning.

1329 I take the correct reading here to be Be sakadägämipatto (found, too, in Burmese manuscripts), as contrasted with Ce and Ee sakadägämi satto. Confusion of $s$ and $p$ is not unusual in Sinhalascript manuscripts. However, the gloss in Mp, sakadägämipuggalo hutvä, suggests that the commentator used a text with the reading sakadägämi satto. It is not impossible that the corruption (if it is one) dates back before the age of the commentaries.

1330 Ce and Be petteyyopi; Ee petteyyo piyo. The only meaning PED
assigns petteyya is "showing filial piety toward one's father," which does not fit here. We should probably read here pettäpiyo, which PED defines as "father's brother, paternal uncle." In the version at 10:75, Ce has pettä pi yo and Ee pettä piyo, which, by closing the spaces, would both give the desired reading. In MN 89.18, II 123,27-124,11, Purāna and Isidatta are said to have been in the employment of King Pasenadi of Kosala but to have shown greater respect toward the Buddha than toward the king. Their love for the Buddha is expressed in SN 55:6, V 348-52.

1331 Mp : "Ānanda said this because he did not know the reason." Brahmāli writes: "I understand Ānanda to simply be saying that it should be understood just as the Buddha explained it," and he suggests rendering the sentence: "Just so, sister, as this was declared by the Blessed One." However, at this point the Buddha's pronouncements on their destiny have not yet been explained. The explanation comes only at the end of the sutta, when the Buddha extols the respective strong points of the two deceased lay disciples.

1332 Ce ambakapañña; Be here has ammakasañña, "a woman's perception" or "a woman's idea," but the Be text of 10:75 reads ammakapañña. Ee has ambakasañña here but ambakapañña in the concluding paragraph. Apparently Ee's former reading is a typographical error for the latter, since on the first occurrence saña is cited as a variant in the notes. Again, the common $s / p$ confusion must lie behind the variants. Ambaka in Ce and Ee (or Be ammaka) is derived from amma, "mother," but with the more general meaning of women. Mp-t explains: "Ammaka (or ambaka) means women (lit., the class of mothers). This is a metaphorical term. That is, mothers, the class of mothers, maternal parents, are found among women" (Ammakäti mätugämo. Upacäravacanañh'etaṃ. Itthīsu yadidaṃ ammakā mātugāmo janani janika). SED sv ambä has "a mother, good woman (as a title of respect)." And under ambika: "mother, good woman (as a term of respect)." The Chinese parallel at T II 258cs-9, does not include the derogatory generalization about women, but states the matter with reference to Migasālā as an individual: "The lay follower Migasāla is foolish and has little wisdom" (理性優婆夷懸癡少智).

1333 The juxtaposition of nominative $k e$ with locative -ñāne is puzzling. I take the sense to be that those referred to by $k e$ are established in this knowledge. Perhaps, though, -ñāne is a residual eastern form, a nominative plural in agreement with $k e$. Mp does not attempt to resolve this problem, but when commenting on "in the knowledge of other persons as superior and inferior" (purisapuggalaparopariyañane), it explains this knowledge as "the knowledge of other persons' superior and inferior faculties by
way of their sharpness or dullness" (purisapuggalānam tikkhamuduvasena indriyaparopariyañānam).

1334 Sāmāyikampi vimuttim na labhati. Mp says that he does not occasionally gain rapture and joy derived from listening to the Dhamma. Patis II 40,16-17, however, defines the near-synonym samayuvimokkho as the four jhānas and four formless attainments (cattāri ca jhānāni, catasso ca arūpasamāpattiyo, ayam samayavimokkho, which it distinguishes from permanent emancipation, identified with the four noble paths, the four fruits of the spiritual life, and nibbāna (cattāro ca ariyamaggā, cattāri ca sāmaññaphalāni, nibbānañca, ayam asamayavimokkho):

1335 Text reads merely tam hi tesam, without specifying what tam refers to. Mp explains that it is the making of the judgment (tam pamānakaranam).

1336 Imam puggalam dhammasotam nibbahati. Mp: "The knowledge of insight, occurring strongly, carries him along; it conducts him to the plane of the noble ones."

1337 Text has lobhadhammā, "states of greed," which Mp glosses as "simply greed" (lobho yeva).

1338 I follow here the text of the printed Ce , with its elisions. The electronic Ce fills in the elisions incorrectly.

1339 Here and in $\S 6$, I read with Ce vacissamsārā, which is also the reading in Mp (Ce). Be and Ee have vacīsañkhārā. Mp glosses: "Just utterances in addressing and conversing" (alāpasallāpavasena vacanān'eva). Vacīsamsāro is at 2:63, where it refers to arguments between factions of monks.

1340 Mp: "Purāna excelled in virtuous behavior, Isidatta in wisdom. Purāna's virtuous behavior matched Isidatta's superior wisdom; Isidatta's wisdom matched Purāna's superior virtuous behavior."

1341 I have divided the stanzas as is done in Be, which I find more satisfactory than Ce. In Ee the lines of verse are not grouped into separate stanzas.

1342 All three editions read evam etam gahatṭhānam cāgo puññam pavaddhati. Thesyntax is not satisfactory yet no variants are noted. Mp attempts to resolve the problem with its gloss, cägoti sañkham gataṃ puññam vaddhati, "merit which is designated 'generosity' increases," but this is implausible. Could there have originally been an ablative cāgā here, or an instrumental cāgena (with the verb vaddhati, to support the meier), which was changed to cāgo by error? The Chinese parallel, MĀ 125, lends some support to this hypothesis at T I 614c20: 园施福增多, "because of generosity merit increases."

1343 Dhammayogā. Mp says this is a name for speakers on the Dhamma
(dhammakathika), but it may refer to all those who adopt a predominantly cognitive approach to the Dhamma. The term seems to be unique to the present text. The distinction posited between meditators and those intent on Dhamma suggests a late origin, when vocations in the Sangha had bifurcated along these lines.

1344 Jhāyanti pajjhayanti. The tone of this is derisive. Be uses a string of four verbs: jhāyanti pajjhāyanti nijjhāyanti avajjhāyanti. For a similar derisive use of verbs based on jhāyanti, see 11:9, V 323,18; MN 50.13, I 334,18-34.

1345 Amataṃ dhātum kāyena phusitvā viharanti. Mp: "This refers to the nibbāna element, called 'the deathless' because it is devoid of death. Having taken up a meditation subject, in stages they dwell having touched it with the mental body."

1346 Gambhiram atthapadam paññāya ativijjha passanti. Mp: "The 'deep and pithy matter' includes the aggregates, elements, sense bases, and so forth, which are subtle and hidden. They see this after penetrating it with insight and path wisdom (sahavipassanāya maggapaññāya)."

1347 Moliyasivaka is also at SN 36:21, IV 230-31, where he inquires from the Buddha whether all feeling is due to past kamma.

1348 On the "directly visible Dhamma" (sanditthiko dhammo), see too 3:53-54.

1349 Lobhadhammā. Similarly, just below, the text has dosadhammā and mohadhammā. Mp glosses as "the factors associated with it" (tamsampayuttadhammā).

1350 Käyasandosam, followed by vacissandosam and manosandosam. Mp glosses the first as a faulty quality in the body-door (käyadvärassa dussanākāram).

1351 Both monks declare, in opposite ways, the arahant's eradication of the three modes of conceit: the superiority conceit, the inferiority conceit, and the equality conceit.

1352 Attho ca vutto attā ca anupanīto. As at 3:72, IV 218,31, there seems to be a word play between attho and attā, "goal" and "self."

1353 Mp glosses ussesu as superior persons, omesu as inferior ones, and samatte as similar ones, explaining: "Arahants do not rank themselves, by way of conceit, as superior, inferior, and equal."

1354 An expanded parallel of 5:24.

1355 Cetasā samphuttapubbā te ca samudācaranti. The expression is unusual. Mp offers merely a routine word gloss.

1356 The questions in Pāli: kimadhippāyā, kimupavicārā, kimadhiṭthānā, kimabhinivesā, kīmpariyosānā.

1357 I read with Ce sathädhiṭthānā, as against Be and Ee sathādhiṭthānā, "a weapon is their support." Mp does not comment, but craftiness ties up better with thickets, darkness, and remaining unseen.

1358 Ākiñcaññäbhinivesā. Mp takes this to mean that their minds are intent on the state of non-grasping (niggahanabhäve).

1359 Mp does not give information about him and he does not appear elsewhere in the Nikāyas.

1360 Strangely, neither Mp nor Mp-t explains why the Buddha refers to Dhammika as brähmana. This may be the only place in the Nikāyas where the Buddha refers to a bhikkhu as a brahmin followed by his personal name.

1361 Reading with Ce and Be pavattèsi, as against Ee patesi, "felled," also cited as a variant in Ce and Be. Mp glosses pavattesi with parivattesi.

1362 Brahmalokasahavyatāya. An odd expression, which also occurs at DN 19.59, II 250,20. Sv II 670,13-14 says: "He taught the path to disciples for companionship with the brahmā world': that is, he explained the path to fellowship with Brahmā in the brahmā world" (sāvakānañca brahmalokasahabyatāya maggam desesi ti brahmaloke brahmunā sahabhāvāya maggam kathesi).

1363 Ditthisampannam. A person who is at least a stream-enterer.

1364 Brahmāli called my attention to an entry in DOP (p. 744) for a noun khanti', meaning "hurt, injury," presumably derived from the verb khanati', "hurts, injures, impairs." This word is not the Pāli equivalent of Skt kṣānti (DOP khanti'), "patience" or "acceptance." Mp glosses khanti here as "digging up one's own virtues" (attano gunakhananam), but DOP points out that the commentaries tend to conflate khanati', "injures," with khanati', "digs up." The Skt equivalent of khanti may be kṣhati, from kṣanoti, "hurts, injures, wounds"; see SED sv kshan.

1365 Ito bahiddhā. That is, those outside the Buddhist community.

1366 Ce na no āmasabrahmacārisu, Be na no samasabrahmacārisu, Ee na no sabrahmacärisu. DOP sv $\bar{a} m a^{3}$ has "in or of the same house; belonging to the same house" and cites $\bar{a} m a s a b r a h m a c a ̄ r i(n)$ as meaning "a fellow religious student belonging to the same house or community." However, it gives this. passage as the sole reference, and the term does not seem to occur elsewhere in the Nikāyas. Mp (Ce) accepts the unusual reading and says: Na no āmasabrahmacārīsū ti ettha āmajano [Be: samajano] nāma sakajano vuccati. Tasmā na no sakesu samānabrahmacārīsu cittāni padutṭhāni bhavissantī. ti ayamettha attho ("Toward our fellow monks of the same house: Here, it is one's own people that are called 'people of the same house.' Therefore the meaning here is: 'There should be no thoughts of hatred toward one's own fellow monks.'"). The passage recurs at 7:73, but with the unaugmented sabrahmacärisu. I suspect that the augmented forms found in the Ce and Be versions of this sutta are the product of an ancient transmission error
that was accepted as authentic by the commentator. I therefore treat the text as reading simply sabrahmacärisu.

1367 This is Sona Kolivisa, declared by the Buddha forernost among those who arouse energy (see 1:205). His verses are at Th 632-44. Th 638-39 refer to the simile of the lute; Th 640-44 are identical with the verses at the end of this sutta. The story of Sona appears in an expanded version at Vin I 179-85, where it leads to the Buddha's granting permission to the monks to wear sandals.

1368 Reading with Ce and Ee: Viriyasamataṃ adhitthaha, iridriyanaṃ ca samataṃ pațivijjha, tattha ca nimittamganhāhi. Where Ce and Eehave viriyasamataṃ, Be has viriyasamathaṃ (but just below, indriyanañca samataṃ). Mp (Ce) also reads viriyasamatham in the lemma. The explanation in Mp seems to support viriyasamatham.

Mp: "Resolve on evenness of energy: Resolve on serenity combined with energy (viriyasampayuttam samatham adhitthaha). The meaning is, 'Link energy with serenity.' Achieve evenness of the spiritual faculties: Keep to evenness, a balance of the spiritual faculties of faith, etc. When faith is linked with wisdom and wisdom with faith; when energy is linked with concentration and concentration with energy, then the balance of the faculties is maintained. But mindfulness is useful everywhere, so it should always be strong.... Seize the object there: When such balance exists, the object can arise clearly, like the reflection of one's face in a mirror; and you should take up (ganhāhi) this object-bring forth (nibbattehi) the object of serenity, of insight, of the path, and of the fruit. Thus the Buddha explained the meditation subject to him, leading up to arahantship."

Chinese parallels to this passage offer quite different readings of the Buddha's injunction, as follows: T I 612a28-29: "Therefore you should distinguish this time (could samataṃ have mutated into samayan?), examine this mark, and do not be heedless" (是故汝當分別此時。觀察此相。莫得放逸); T II 62c17-18: "Therefore you should practice by taking up [the object] in a balanced way; do not cling, do not be heedless, and do not grasp marks" (是故汝當平等修習攝受，莫著、莫放逸、莫取相); T II 612b19-20: "If you can stay in the middle, this is the superior practice" (若能在中者。此則上行); T XXII 844c1-2 is closest to the Pāli: "You should balance your energy, balance the faculties" (應等請進等於諸根).

1369 In Pāli: nekkhammādhimutto, pavivekādhimutto, abyāpajjhādhimutto, tanhakkhayādhimutto, upādānakkhayāahimutto, asammohādhimutto. Mp says that each expression signifies arahantship.

1370 Karanīyaṃattano asamanupassanto katassa vā paticayaṃ. Mp glosses paticayaṃ with "growth by repeated activity" (punappunaṃ karaṇena vaḍdhim).

1371 Sīlabbataparāmāsam ...sārato paccāgacchanto. This expression normally refers to the extreme austerities of those who believe them to be the core of spiritual cultivation. See 3:78.

1372 All three editions abridge the last three items as is done here.

1373 Vayancc'assānupassati. Mp: "He sees the arising and vanishing of that mind" (tassa c'esa cittassa uppadampi vayampi passati).

1374 The similes that follow are found among other places also at MN 97.29, II 193,1-19, and SN 35:87, IV 56,17-57,5.

1375. This means that he passed away as a non-returner.

1376 I follow. Be and Ee, in which the first, second, fourth, and fifth benefits come from listening to the Dhamma at the proper time (kálena dhammassavane), the third and sixth from examining the meaning at the proper time (kālena atth'upaparikkhāya). Ce combines the two for the third and sixth items, which seems less satisfactory, because in these two situations the monk doesn't get to hear the Dhamma.

1377 Anuttare upadhisankhaye. Mp identifies this as nibbāna. On the acquisitions (upadhi), see p. 1621, note 219.

1378 Chatabhijätiyo. Pūraṇa Kassapa is one of the six teachers contemporary with the Buddha. This is the only place where he is associated with the doctrine of the six classes, which are not mentioned elsewhere in the Nikāyas. In DN 2.17, I 52,22-53,4, he is depicted as a proponent of the doctrine of non-doing (akiriyavāda), but at SN 46:56, V. 126,26-30, the doctrine of non-causality (ahetukaväda) is ascribed to him.

1379 Bhikkhū kantakavuttikā. The exact intent is not clear, but the tone is pejorative. Mp says only that these are samanas.

1380 Nibbānam abhijayati. Mp: "Produces nibbāna: that is, he attains nibbāna, or he is born into the class of nibbāna consisting in the plane of the noble ones" (nibbānam abhijayatīti nibbānam pāpunāti, ariyabhūmisañkhātāya vā nibbānajātiyā jāyati). This explanation is given because in strict doctrinal terms nibbāna, being ajāta and akata, "unborn" and "unmade," is without birth or production.

1381 As at 3:13, 4:85, but here all three editions put nesādakule before venakule.

1382 In Pāli: āsavā saṃvarā pahātabbā, āsavā paṭisevanā pahātabbā, āsavā adhivāsanā pahātabbā, āsavā parivajjanā pahātabbā, āsavā vinodana pahātabbā, āsavā bhāvanā pahātabbā. These six, preceded by "taints to be abandoned by seeing" (āsavā dassanā pahātabbā), are treated in detail in the Sabbāsava Sutta (MN 2), where the explanations are the same as those given here.

1383 This sentence is missing in Be, but it occurs in Ce and Ee and has parallels in the sections on the other methods of abandoning the taints.

1384 His name means "dealer in firewood." Mp says that he was so named because he earned his living by selling firewood.

1385 The three qualities he mentions are ascetic practices (dhutanga). These are contrasted below with non-ascetic monastic practices: living near a village, accepting invitations from laypeople to meals at their homes, and wearing robes prepared by householders.

1386 Mp says that some time later, five hundred bhikkhus who visited families returned to lay life. When he heard this he said, "What does that have to do with me?" and his faith did not vacillate. It was in anticipation of this that the Buddha said to him: "When you give gifts to the Sangha, your mind will be confident." On the special merits of gifts to the Sangha, see MN 142.7-8, III $255-56$.

1387 Abhidhammakatham kathenti. Mp explains this as "a talk involved with the Abhidhamma" (abhidhammamissakam katham), but I take abhidhammakatham here as a mere referential term. On this use of the expression, see p. 1733, note 1086.

1388 Katham opateti (as in Ce and Be; Ee has the aorist opatesi). Mp: "He interrupted their discussion and gave his own explanation" (tesan katham vicchinditva attano katham katheti).

1389 Gopās $\bar{u}$. I translate following Mp: gāvo ca ajika ca.

1390 Sippisambuka. PED suggests "oyster" for sippi, but oysters are marine animals. My rendering is intended to escape the difficulty.

1391 Animittam cetosamädhim. Mp: "All marks are all such marks as permanence and so forth. The markless mental concentration is the concentration of strong insight (balavavipassanasamädhim)."

1392 Sarissati nekkhammassa. Mp: "He will remember the virtues of going forth."

1393 Mp explains that Citta returned to lay life seven times and went forth seven times. The reason for his instability was that during the time of the Buddha Kassapa he had persuaded a bhikkhu to return to lay life. Therefore, even though he had the supporting conditions for arahantship, because of that kamma he had to move back and forth seven times between lay life and monastic life before attaining arahantship.

1394 Sn 1042. The brahmin student's name is Tissa Metteyya. On the Pārāyana, see p. 1639, note 367.

1395 Majjhe mantä na lippati. Mp glosses mantā with pañ̃̃a, taking it to be a feminine noun. In this it follows Nidd II 10,12; which glosses mantā as if it were a truncated feminine instrumental: majjhe mantaya na lippati. I think it more likely, however, that mantā is the nominative of the agent noun mantar, "a thinker, a wise man." On this form, see Norman 2006b: 190-91.

1396 Mp explains: "The contact (phassa) at the first end is one individual existence (attabhāva), which is produced by way of contact. The origin of contact (phassasamudaya), the second end, is the future existence, produced with the contact of the kamma done in this existence as its condition. The cessation of contact (phassanirodha) is nibbāna. Nibbāna is said to be in the middle because it cuts in half craving, the seamstress." In my opinion, it would make better sense to see phassanirodha here; not as nibbāna, but as the ceasing of contact at the end of the first existence. Craving is then the seamstress because it ties the contact of the previous existence to the initial arising of contact at the start of the new existence.

1397 Mp: "What should be directly known (abhiññeyyam) is the four noble truths; what should be fully understood (pariññeyyam) is the pair of mundane truths (suffering and its origin). In this very life, he makes an end of the suffering of the round; he terminates it and eradicates it."

1398 Mp: "Consciousness-both rebirth-consciousness and the other kinds-is said to be in the middle because it occurs as the condition for name and form."

1399 Mp: "Kammic consciousness is in the middle; or here, because kamma is included by the mind-base among the internal bases, any kind of consciousness is in the middle; or else the javana consciousness is dependent on an internal base-for [it depends on] adverting in the mind-door-and so it is said to be in the middle."

1400 Mp: "Personal existence (sakkāya) is the round of existence with its three planes. The origin of personal existence is the truth of the origin; the cessation of personal existence is the truth of cessation." Again, I would interpret this as I did the first presentation: personal existence is the present existence; the origin of personal existence is the arising of the next existence; the cessation of personal existence is the ceasing of the present existence. And craving, by generating rebirth, sews the future existence to this present one.

1401 In a Chinese parallel to this sutta, SĀ 1164 (T II 310b20-311a2), the bhikkhus propose only five interpretations of the verse: (1) six internal bases, six external bases, and feeling; (2) the past, the future, and the present; (3) pleasure, pain, and neither pain nor pleasure; (4) existence, its origin, and feeling; (5) identity and its origin (the middle term is missing). When they inquire from the Buddha, he explains the verse in terms of contact, its origin, and feeling. The verse in the Chinese does not have a word corresponding to Pāli mantā.

1402 Here I follow the uddāna verse of Be. The Ce version is not clear to me.

1403 As at 6:44, III 348, a 10. It seems that this is Ānanda's way of simply confirming that the Buddha had said something without committing himself to an interpretation of the statement.

1404 Kathañhi nāma yam mayā ckamsena byākataṃ tattha dvejjhā āpajjissati. The Buddha's statement here belongs to his first way of answering a question, namely, by making a categorical assertion. On the four ways of answering a question, see 3:67, 4:42.

1405 Vālaggakotinittudanamattampi sukkadhammam. Mp: "An amount that could be seen on the tip of a hair; or an amount that could be poked with the tip of a hair."

1406 Ce and Ee have vibhajantassa, as against Be vibhajissami, which Ee notes as a variant from a Burmese manuscript. The Be reading seems a normalization, but since the $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Ee}$ reading leaves the sentence grammatically incomplete, I follow Be. The plural -ñānāni is in the text, and thus I use the plural "knowledges" even though it sounds odd in English.

1407 I read with Ce kusalamālā, as against Be and Ee kusalā.

1408 Abhidose addharattam bhattakālasamaye. DOP sv addha defines addharattam as "midnight." On bhattakālasamaye, Mp says "the time for a meal in the king's court" (rajakulānaṃ bhattakalasañkhate samaye). Perhaps in the Buddha's time the royal court ended the day with a midnight meal.

1409 Nibbedhikapariyāyaṃ vo bhikkhave dhammapariyāyaṃ desessāmi. Mp: "A penetrative exposition is one that penetrates and splits the mass of greed, [hatred, and delusion] that had not been penetrated and split before."

1410 The text alternates between singular and plural forms of kamma. I have used the singular, which sounds more natural in English.

1411 Contrary to all three editions, I regard the first occurrence of sañkapparāgo purisassa kāmo as either prose or a line of a familiar verse being quoted in the prose. The following verse will then be a normal verse of four lines rather than one of five lines. See SN 1:34, 122, where the verse occurs with only four lines. Mp explains sāñkapparāgo as "lust arisen by way of intention" (sañkappavasena uppannarāgo). Kāmasañkappa is one of the three types of unwholesome thought, and it is clear from the context that this is what is meant. For further discussion, see CDB 366, note 72. The verse is not included in the Chinese parallel, MĀ 111.

1412 Mp explains this as the coexistent contact (sahajataphassa).

1413 Mp: "One desiring celestial sensual pleasures, by fulfilling good conduct, is reborn in the deva world [and acquires] an individual existence that is a consequence of merit. By engaging in
misconduct, one is reborn in the plane of misery [and acquires] an individual existence that is a consequence of demerit."

1414 Regarding this last phrase, Mp says that it is just the spiritual life of the path (brahmacariyasañkhāto maggo va) that is called the cessation of sensual pleasures. It will be observed that each section follows the pattern of the four noble truths, with two additions: diversity (vemattatī) and result (vipäka).

1415 Sämisa. Mp: "Associated with the bait of the defilements" (kilesämisasampayuttä).

1416 Vohäravepakkaṃ . . . sañ̃̃am vadämi. Mp: "Expression, consisting in talk, is the result of perception."

1417 Cetana 'ham bhikkhave kammaṃ vadämi. This should probably be understood to mean that volition is a necessary factor in creating kamma, not that volition on its own invariably and in all instances creates kamma. It can thus be seen as a counterfoil to the Jain position that any action, even an unintentional one, creates kamma. The Chinese parallel, MĀ 111, at T I 600a23-24, says: "How does one understand kamma? There are two kinds of kamma: intention and the kamma [created] when one has intended" (云何知業，謂有二業思，已思業。).

1418. This statement should be understood in the sense that the results of kamma are to be experienced in their respective realms.

1419 See p. 1639, note 372, and p. 1666, note 547. The Chinese parallel, MA 111, has here the fourfold distinction of kamma found in 4:232-33. But MĀ 15 (at T I 437b26) speaks of only two kinds of results, in this life or in a later life, without a third alternative.

1420 This should probably be understood in the sense that, because contact is the condition for intention and kamma can be explained as intention, contact is therefore the condition for kamma.

1421 Ko ekapadaṃ dvipadaṃ jānāti imassa dukkhassa nirodhāya. Mp: "The meaning is: 'Who knows a mantra, a one-word or two-word mantra?" The Chinese parallel at T I 600b17-18 uses the character呪 ( $=$ 死), meaning "mantra."

1422 It is strange that only six Tathāgata's powers are mentioned here. Usually, ten Tathāgata's powers are cited (identified as ñānabalāni, powers of knowledge). In AN the ten are in 10:21. They are also at MN 12.9-20, I 69-71, and analyzed at Vibh 33544 (Be §§809-31).

1423 Some examples of the possible (thāna) and the impossible (atṭhāna) are at 1:268-95; MN 115.12-19, III 64-67; and Vibh 335-38 (Be §809).

1424 Thānaso hetuso. Mp explains possibility (thāna) as condition (paccaya). Following Vibh 338-39 (Be $\S 810$ ), it takes this to be knowledge of the conditions for kamma bringing a result in connection
with four factors that can either reinforce or impede its maturation: realm (gati, one's place of rebirth), acquisitions (upadhi, one's body and mind), time ( $k \bar{a} l a$ ), and effort (payoga). The cause (hetu) is the kamma itself.

1425 The four jhānas are found throughout the Nikāyas. The eight emancipations (vimokkha) are at 8:66. The three kinds of concentration (samädhi) are at 8:63: concentration with thought and examination, without thought but with examination only, and without thought and examination. The nine meditative attainments (samäpatti) are the same as the nine progressive dwellings (anupubbavihärā) at 9:32. The defilement (samkilesa) is a quality that leads to deterioration; the cleansing (vodāna) is a quality that makes for distinction; and the emergence (vutthāna), according to Vibh 342-43 (Be §828), is the cleansing and emergence itself: "Cleansing" here means that proficiency in the lower jhāna is the foundation for the next higher jhāna; "emergence itself" means coming out from the jhāna.

1426 Ce and Be indicate, by the use of ellipsis points, that the last three sections should be expanded in full, as in 6:2. To facilitate readability, I present these sections without showing the elision of stock phrases.

1427 The Abhidhamma commentary, As 239,25-240,2 (Be §362), explains rūparäga as "desire and lust for form-[sphere] existence" (rūpabhave chandarāgo) and arāparāga as "desire and lust for formless-[sphere] existence" (arūpabhave chandarāgo). While the word "lust" may seem. strong in relation to these refined realms of existence, I feel it is useful to render räga consistently.

1428 Cittassa nimittam. Mp: "The object of the mind of concentration and insight, the aspect of concentration and insight" (samädhivipassanācittassa nimittam samädhivipassanākāram). Mp is apparently interpreting this via the two meanings of the word nimitta, as object and as "mark" or aspect.

1429 Tatra tatra. Lit., "there [and] there." Mp: "This or that state of distinction" (tasmiṃ tasmiṃ visese). Mp simply glosses āyatane with kārane ("cause"), but see p. 1669, note 562. On the first four of the six factors, see 4:179.

1430 Mp : "Conceit (māna) is conceiving oneself [to be better] based on birth, etc. The inferiority complex (omana) is the conceit, 'I am inferior' (hīno'ham asmī ti māna). Arrogance (atimāna) is the conceit of self-elevation. Self-overestimation (adhimana) is imagining oneself to have attained [what one has not really attained]. Obstinacy (thambha) is due to anger and conceit. Self-abasement (atinipāta) is the conceit 'I am inferior' occurring in one who is actually inferior."

1431 Älokabahulo. Mp: "He abounds in the light of knowledge" (ñānālokabahulo).

1432 Mp: "The mind is to be suppressed (niggahetabbam) by concentration on an occasion of restlessness; it is to be exerted by energy at a time when it has fallen into sluggishness; it is to be encouraged (paggahetabbam) with concentration at a time when it is listless; and it is to be looked at (ajjhupekkhitabbam) with the equanimity enlightenment factor when it is'proceding evenly." These aspects of mental development are discussed in detail at Vism 130-35, Ppn 4.51-64.

1433 See 3:22, 5:151-53, p. 1638, note 358; and p. 1739, note 1150.

1434 Mp: "Obstruction by kamma (kammāvaranatā) occurs through the five grave deeds with immediate result (see 6:87). Obstruction by defilement (kilesāvaranata) occurs through wrong view with fixed result (that is, a grave wrong view that denies the working of kamma). Obstruction by result (vipākāvaranatā) is an unwholesome resultant rebirth or a rootless wholesome resultant rebirth." These two types of rebirth consciousness lack the root of wisdom and thus one reborn through them is incapable of attaining the path. One reborn with a two-rooted rebirth consciousness, lacking the root of wisdom, is also incapable of attaining the path. On the role of rebirth consciousness, see CMA 179, 194-95. The kind of desire (chanda) that is needed is wholesome desire; desire to do the good (kattukamyatāchandam).

1435 I follow Be, which does not have $p i$ here, as against Ce and Ee, which have $p i$. In the partly parallel 5:151-53, Ce and Ee do not have $p i$. It seems the sense requires that $p i$ should be excluded; for it is when listening to the good Dhamma that one would expect a person to enter the path. The same applies to $\mathbf{6 : 8 7}$ and $\mathbf{6 : 8 8}$ just below.

1436 Atthami riñcati. Mp: "One discards the benefit of growth" (vaddhiaitham chaddeti). Mp explains attha here in an ethical sense, as good or benefit. However, since the word is used in connection with someone listening to the teaching, it seems more likely that its semantic sense-namely, "meaning"-is intended. Thus attha is the correct meaning of the exposition, while anattha is a false meaning resulting from misinterpretation.

1437 The word khanti, normally meaning "patience," is used in relation to contemplative practice to mean one's beliefs or convictions. I base the parenthetical addition here on Mp's gloss, sāsanassa ananulomikāya, "not in conformity with the teaching."

1438 Ditthisampadam. Mp: "The path of stream-entry" (sotāpattimaggam).

1439 Anägamanīyam vatthum paccāgantum. Mp explains that he is
incapable of the five enmities (that is, breach of the five precepts) and of adopting any of the sixty-two speculative views.

1440 Mp : "'An eighth existence' means that he cannot take an eighth rebirth in the sense sphere."

1441 Ce and Beänantariyam kammam; Eeanantariyam kammam. Strangely, though this term commonly occurs in doctrinal expositions of Buddhism, a search for it in CST 4.0 turns up only one occurrence in the entire Sutta Pitaka, namely, this one. The expression also occurs in the Vinaya Pitaka, but only once, in the Devadatta story at Vin.II 193,9. An anantariya kamma is understood to be a grave misdeed that in the immediately following existence necessarily produces a rebirth in hell. The five acts that constitute this type of kamma are mentioned at 5:129, 6:87, and just below at 6:94.

1442 ito bahiddhā dakkhiṇeyyam gavesitum. That is, incapable of seeking a person of noble attainment outside the Buddha's teaching.

1443 Aññam sattharam uddisitum. That is, of looking to someone else apart from the Buddha as one's ultimate spiritual teacher.

1444 Sammatianiyamam okkamissati: Sammattaniyamam is obviously an abridgment of niyamam kusalesu dhammest sammattaṃ, on which see p. 1638, note 358, and p. 1739, note 1150.

1445 Sabbasañkhäresu anodhim karitvä aniccasaññam upatthāpetum. Mp: "Unlimited: without setting a boundary thus: 'Only these conditioned phenomena, but no others, are impermanent.'"

1446 Ce and Ee have gacchanți, but the future meaning (originally conveyed by this form) seems intended here. Be has gacchissanti, perhaps a novel future form.

1447 I read with Be and Ee bhavissami, as against Ce bhavissati.

1448 Sabbaloke atammayo bhavissami. Mp: "Identification (tammayo) is craving and views; non-identification (atammayo) is their absence."

1449 A composite six, made up of two triads.

1450 Another composite six.

1451 Pannāsakātirekā vaggā. This is the general title Ce assigns to these three additional chapters, which it then numbers 1,2 , and 3. Ee gives this the title Pannāsasañgahito vaggo, "Chapter included with the Fifty" (?). Be does not assign a general title to the additional chapters, but numbers them 11, 12, and 13 in succession to the earlier vaggas of this nipāta.

1452 From this point on there are no uddana verses to rely on for sutta titles. I thus adopt the titles in Ce.

1453 It is often claimed that this series of suttas testifies to a large number of lay arahants during the Buddha's time. This, however, is a misunderstanding. For we find on this list Anāthapiṇ̣ika, Pūraṇa (or Purāṇa), and Isidatta, all of whom were reborn in the

Tusita heaven (see 6:44 and MN 143.16, III 262,1). We also find Ugga of Vesālī, who is said (at 5:44) to have been reborn among the mind-made deities, and Hatthaka, who is said (at 3:127) to have been reborn in the Aviha heaven of the pure abodes. The terms used to describe these lay followers are descriptive of all noble ones from stream-enterers on up. They all have unwavering confidence (aveccappasāda) in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha, have "reached certainty about the Tathāgata" (tathägate nitthañgata), and are seers of nibbāna, the deathless (amataddasa). See 10:63, where certainty about the Buddha is ascribed to disciples at levels lower than arahantship. The statement that these people have noble liberation (ariyena vimuttiya) is unusual, but Mp glosses it "by the liberation of the fruit of trainees" (sekhaphalavimuttiya). Quite a different formula is used to describe an arahant. In the Nikāyas there are no recorded cases of laypeople who attained arahantship and then continued to lead the lay life. Those who do attain it entered upon the homeless life soon after their attainment, like Yasa at Vin I 17,1-3.

1454 The total number of suttas in this repetition series is calculated by taking the ten modes of treatment (from "direct knowledge" to "relinquishment") in regard to the seventeen defilements (from lust to heedlessness); this gives 170 . Since each mode of treatment is to be accomplished by developing one or another of the three sets of six, this gives a total of 510 suttas.

# Notes to the Sevens

1455 Anavaññattikāmo. Lit., "desirous of not being looked down upon." Mp: "He desires to be well known" (abhiññātabhāvakāmo). Thoughts about one's reputation (anavaññattipatisamyutto vitakko) is a type of distracting thought that must be overcome to gain concentration; see 3:101, I 254,23.

1456 I follow Ce, which reads sataṃ bhante sahassānaṃ. Be and Ee have sataṃ bhante satasahassānaṃ, "a hundred [times] a hundred thousand."

1457 Satta samyojanāni. The familiar scheme of ten fetters occurs in AN only in 10:13.

1458 Anunayasamyojanam. An unusual listing among the fetters. Mp glosses it as the fetter of sensual lust (kāmarāgasamyojanam).

1459 Envy (issa) and miserliness (macchariya) are listed among the ten fetters of the Abhidhamma method. See Dhs 197 (Be §1118), CMA 269.

1460 Niranusayo is not in Be or Ee. Ee notes variant readings in manuscripts. But see SN IV 205,17, where Be has niranusayo, as against Ce and Ee pahīnarāgānusayo.

1461 This is stated from the perspective of monastics thinking to approach families for alms.

1462 Mp: "They do not rise up from their seats in a humble manner but show disrespect."

1463 The seven are explained in detail at MN 70.14-21, I 477-79. In brief, the one liberated in both respects and the one liberated by wisdom are two kinds of arahants, distinguished by whether or not they possess the "peaceful formless emancipations transcending form." The body witness, the one attained to view, and the one liberated by faith are three kinds of trainees, who can range anywhere from stream-enterer to one on the path to arahantship; they have already been discussed at 3:21. The Dhamma follower and the faith follower are two types who have entered the path to stream-entry but have not yet realized the fruit; they are distinguished according to whether wisdom or faith is their dominant faculty. The process by which they enter the path is described at SN 25:1, III 225.

1464 Pārangato thale tiṭthati brāhmaṇo. Here, "brahmin" is used as a synonym for the arahant. See in this connection 4:5 §4 and SN 35:228; IV 157,19-20.

1465 At Pp 13 (Be §16) this person is called a samasisī, lit., "a sameheader." Mp explains that there are four kinds of samasisī. (1) One who has been ill and attains the destruction of the taints at the same time that he recovers from the illness is called an "illness same-header" (rogasamasisī). (2) One who has been afflicted with a severe painful feeling and attains the destruction of the taints at the same time that he overcomes the pain is called a "feeling same-header" (vedanāsamasīsī). (3) One who has been practicing insight in a particular posture and attains the destruction of the taints at the same time that he breaks the posture is called a "posture same-header" (irīyāpathasamasīsī). (4) And one who attains the destruction of the taints at the same time that his life ends is called a "life same-header" (jīvitasamasīsī). In this sutta, the "life same-header" is intended.

1466 Antarāparinibbāyī. Lit., "one who attains nibbāna in between (or along the way)." Pp 16 (Be §36) defines this person as one who eliminates the five lower fetters, takes spontaneous birth, and then, either immediately after being reborn or (at the latest) before reaching the middle of the life span, generates the path for abandoning the five higher fetters. Similarly, Mp defines this type as a person who is reborn somewhere among the pure abodes (suddhāväsesu) and then attains arahantship either at the time of rebirth, slightly afterward, or before reaching the middle of the life span. In spite of these authorized definitions, I believe there is textual evidence that the name of this type should be
understood to mean literally that he attains the destruction of the taints in between or along the way (antara), that is, between two lives, and then attains final nibbāna without taking rebirth at all. See 4:131 and p. 1701, note 829. I give further arguments for this interpretation below in note 1536 on p. 1782.

1467 Upahaccaparinibbāyī. Both Pp 17 (Be §37) and Mp define this type as one who eliminates the five lower fetters, takes spontaneous rebirth (in the pure abodes), and then reaches arahantship after passing the middle of the life span or, at the latest, at the time of death. Again, as I will maintain in relation to 7:55, there are suggestions in the Nikāyas that this type is one who attains the destruction of the taints almost immediately after taking rebirth in the pure abodes. See p. 1782, note 1537.

1468 The difference between (5) and (6) is probably determined primarily on the basis of the amount of effort they must put forth to win the goal. Pp 17 (Be $\S \S 38-39$ ) says merely that one generates the path without effort and the other as the result of effort. In any case, on the commentarial interpretation these two become, not separate types of non-returners, but two modes in which the first two types (the antarāparinibbāyī and the upahaccaparinibbāyī) attain nibbāna. Such an explanation would reduce the distinct types of non-returners to three. This would override the sequential and mutually exclusive nature of the five types, which is implied by the fivefold classification and strongly suggested by the similes of 7:55.

1469 See p. 1701, note 828.

1470 By using ellipsis points, Ee incorporates 7:18 and 7:19 into 7:17, and thus at this point its numbering falls two short of my own. My numbering follows Ce and Be in counting the expositions based on non-self and nibbāna as distinct suttas.

1471 Whereas the contemplations of impermanence and suffering are directed toward all conditioned phenomena (sabbasañkhāresu), the contemplation of non-self is directed toward all phenomena without qualification (sabbadhammesu).

1472 Niddasavatthūni. PED takes niddasa to be a wrong reading for niddesa and explains the compound to mean "object of distinction, or praise." SED sv nirdasa gives "more than ten days old, happened more than ten days ago." The expression itself, however, has no necessary connection with days and could also be explained by taking $n i$ to be a privative prefix and thus meaning "without ten." Thus as used here it might just as well mean "without ten years." Mp accepts the reading as given and offers an explanation, which I translate just below. It could be that the original meaning of the expression is irretrievably lost and in interpreting it we have
nothing to rely on but conjecture. There are no identified Chinese parallels to this sutta or to 7:42-43 below to serve as a check.

Here is Mp: "The question ['How is one tenless?'] is said to have arisen among the outside sectarians. For they call a Niganṭha [a Jain ascetic] niddaso ("ten-less") who has died at the time he is ten years of age [dasavassakale; or: "at the time he has ten years' seniority" (as an ascetic)?]. For, it is said, he does not become ten years of age again. And not only doesn't he become ten years of age again, [he doesn't become] nine years of age or even one year of age. In this way, they call a Nigantha who is dead at the age of twenty years, and so on, nibbiso ('twenty-less'), nittinso ('thirty-less'), niccattāliso ('forty-less'), nippainnāso ('fiftyless'). When Ānanda was wandering in the village, he heard this discussion and reported it to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said: 'This is not a designation for the sectarians, Ānanda, but for the taint-destroyer [arahant] in my teaching.' For if the taint-destroyer attains final nibbāna when he is ten years of age [or: has ten years' seniority?], he does not become one of ten years again. Not only one of ten years, he doesn't become one of nine years... of a single year. Not only one of a single year, he doesn't become one of eleven months...nor even one of a single moment. Why? Because he never again takes rebirth. The same method for one who is 'twenty-less' and so on. Thus the Blessed One begins this teaching to show the causes for becoming one who is 'ten-less.'"

1473 Tcchāvinaye tibbacchando hoti āyatiñca icchāvinaye avigatapemo. I here render iccha as "vain wishes" and chanda as "desire." Mp glosses icchā with tanhā, craving.

1474 This teaching is referred to at DN 16.1.5, II 75,23-31.

1475 I add "the city" on the basis of Mp's gloss: "situated inside the city" (antonagare thitāni).

1476 Mp: "When people neglect the righteous oblations, the deities do not protect them, and even if they cannot create new suffering, they intensify arisen suffering, such as coughs and headaches, etc.; and in time of war, the people have no allies. But when people don't neglect the oblations, the deities protect them well, and even if they cannot create new happiness, they remove old illnesses; and when war breaks out, the people have allies."

1477 What follows is also in DN 16.1.1-5, II 72-76.

1478 The text of 7:23-27 is at DN 16.1.6-10, II 76-80.

1479 Mp: "As long as they do not come to a stop at some attainment, such as purification of virtuous behavior, jhāna, insight, streamentry, and so forth, without having attained arahantship, only growth is to be expected for the bhikkhus."

1480 All these perceptions are explained at 10:60, with three additions.

1481 Reading with Ee na iti patisañcikkhati. Ce and Be omit na. Brahmāli suggests "he is supposed to leave this work for the theras [elders], who are expected to look after it."

1482 Ce attana voyogam apajjati; Ee attanā vo yogam apajjati; Be attanā tesu yogam āpajjati. Again, I follow Brahmāli's interpretation: "Since it is the task of these elders, they will have to take ultimate responsibility (and the blame or praise) no matter who carries it out. Thus he should leave it to them."

1483 Tattha ca pubbakāram karoti. See 5:175, 6:93. Mp: "He first gives to those following other creeds and only afterwards to bhikkhus."

1484 Be , but not Ce or Ee, has the following before the verses: "This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this."

1485 Ee joins this sutta and the next and mistakenly counts them as three, 28-30. Thus Ee's numbering, which had been two behind my own, now lags behind by one.

1486 An expanded parallel of 6:32.

1487 An expanded parallel of 6:33.

1488 An expanded parallel of 6:69, without the preliminary portion of the latter.

1489 An expanded parallel of 3:135.

1490 Khinena nātimañati. I translate on the supposition that khīnena is an adverb meaning "hurtfully, roughly" (see DOP sv khina ${ }^{2}$ ). Mp, however, explains the line on the assumption that khinena means "in [time of] loss, when wealth has been exhausted": "When one's wealth is exhausted, he does not despise one because of one's loss. He does not think too highly of himself and look down on the other" (tassa bhoge khine tena khayena tam nātimaññati, tasmiṃomānaṃ attani ca atimānaṃ na karoti). On Mp's interpretation, though, I do not see how this factor would differ from the preceding one.

1491 Vattā. Mp says only "he is skilled in speech" (vacanakusalo). Since giving deep talks is listed as a separate item, here presumably the meaning is that he gives good advice.

1492 On the four analytical knowledges (patisambhidā), see 4:172.

1493 I translate the text exactly as it has come down, but it seems that in the course of transmission a phrase dropped out suggesting that mental sluggishness has arisen on a particular occasion. Mp thus provides the missing phrase, uppanne cetaso tinatte, "when mental sluggishness has arisen."

1494 Mp connects internal constriction with dullness and drowsiness, and external distraction with attraction toward the five objects of sensual pleasure. See in this connection SN 51:20, 279,28-280,4.

1495 At 4:41 §3, this is called "the development of concentration that leads to mindfulness and clear comprehension." Mp: "Feeling, etc., are the roots of mental proliferation (papañca). For feeling is the root of craving, which arises in relation to pleasure. Perception is the root of views, which arise toward an unclear object. And thought is the root of conceit, which arises through the thought, 'I am.'"

1496 Mp explains "mark" (nimitta) here as cause (kärana).

1497 Ee prints this as a continuation of the preceding sutta, but Ce and Be , which I follow, treat it as distinct. My numbering again exceeds that of Ee by two.

1498 Though the text here uses the present tense pajänäti, I construe this as the historical present, referring to the time before Sāriputta attained arahantship. As an arahant he would no longer have been prone to mental sluggishness, internal constriction, or external distraction.

1499 Six of these skills, excluding the first, are mentioned at 6:24.

1500 Again, Ee prints this as a continuation of the preceding sutta, but Ce and Be consider it distinct. Since I follow Ce and Be, my numbering now exceeds Ee by three.

1501 See 7:20.

1502 Viññānatthitiyo. The word is used here in a different sense than at SN 22:54, III 54,26, where the four viñ̃̃ānatthitiyo are the four aggregates functioning as the supports for viñ̃̃āna. In the present sutta they are planes of rebirth. Mp calls them "grounds for the rebirth consciousness" (pațisandhivinñā̄nassa ṭhānāni). The original meaning of the seven, as described here, is probably lost. Mp explains them against the background of the Abhidhamma distinction among types of rebirth consciousness, for which see CMA 179-80, 210-19.

1503 Mp: "Human beings are different in body (nānattakāyā) because there are no two people whose bodies are exactly alike. They are different in perception (nänattasaññino) because in some cases their rebirth perception (paṭisandhisañ̃ā) has three roots, in others two roots, and in still others it is rootless. The devas mentioned are the six sense-sphere devas. The beings in the lower world are certain yakkhas and spirits outside the plane of misery."

1504 Mp: "These are the devas of Brahmā's assembly, Brahmā's ministers, and the great brahmās. Their bodies are different in pervasion according to their respective level, but their perception is the same because they all have the perception pertaining to the first jhāna. The beings in the four planes of misery also belong to this group. Their bodies are different, but they all have a [rebirth] perception that is a rootless unwholesome resultant."

1505 Mp takes "the devas of streaming radiance" (devā äbhassarā) to represent all three classes of devas pertaining to the second jhāna: those of limited radiance, measureless radiance, and streaming radiance. In each plane, their bodies are identical in that they all have the same pervasion (ekavipphäro va), but their perception is different in that some are without thought but retain examination (avitakka-vicäramattā), while others are without thought and examination (avitakka-avicärā).

1506 Mp : "The devas of refulgent glory (subhakinh $\bar{a}$ ) are identical in body, and also identical in perception because they all have the perception pertaining to the fourth jhāna (in the Abhidhamma, scheme of five jhānas). The devas of great fruit (who are reborn through the fifth jhāna of the fivefold scheme) fall under the fourth station of consciousness. The non-percipient beings do not have consciousness and thus are not included."

1507 The non-percipient devas and the devas of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception are included among the nine abodes of beings (see 9:24) but not among the stations of consciousness.

1508 Ariyo sammāsamädhi sa-upaniso itipi saparikkhāro itipi. The "supports" (upanisā) and "accessories" (parikkhārā) are the other seven path factors. See too MN 117, III 71,22.

1509 The meanings of these seven fires will be explained in the following sutta.

1510 Mp says that thūna is the sacrificial post itself: yūpasañkhātam thünan.

1511 Ce and Be atohayam (Ee ato 'yam), brāhmaṇa, āhuto sambhūto. Mp glosses: atohayan ti ato hi mātāpitito ayam āhuto ti āgato. There seems to be a word play here between ähuta as representing äbhüta, "originated," and as past participle of ajuhati, "offered, sacrificed." See DOP sv āhuta ${ }^{1}$ and āhuta ${ }^{2}$.

1512 Appatikulyatā sanṭhāti. Lit., "[if] non-revulsion becomes settled."

1513 Natthimepubbenāparam viseso. Ibasethis rendering of pubbenāparam visesa on Mp: "There is no distinction between the earlier time when I had not developed it and the later time when I developed it" (natthi mayham pubbena abhāvitakalena saddhim aparam bhāvitakāle viseso). In other contexts pubbenāparam visesa means the successive stages of excellence reached by mental development, but that explanation does not work here.

1514 Mp connects "I-making" (ahañkära) with views, "mine-making" (mamañkära) with craving, and conceit with the ninefold conceit (navavidhamāna): that is, considering oneself superior, equal, or inferior, each in relation to one who is actually superior, equal,
or inferior. "Transcended discrimination" (vidhāsamatikkanta) means having overcome the threefold conceit of being superior, equal, or inferior.

1515 Mp : "It is said that he thought: 'In the system of the brahmins, one lives the celibate life for forty-eight years studying the Vedas. But the ascetic Gotama, living at home, enjoys himself with the three kinds of dancing girls in three mansions. So what now will he say?' Thus he asks with reference to this. Then the Blessed One, as if gaining control of a black snake with a mantra or as if stepping on an enemy's neck with his foot, roars his lion's roar. He shows that even during his six years of striving, a time when he still had defilements, not even a thought arose in him with regard to the pleasure of rulership or the dancing girls in his mansions."

1516 Samyogavisamyogam dhammapariyāyam. The title might also have been rendered "connection and disconnection."

1517 In Pāli: itthikuttam, itthākappam, itthividham, itthicchandam, itthissaram, itthālañkāram. Apparently it is these seven terms, and their masculine counterparts (with purisa in place of itthi), that explain the inclusion of this sutta in the Sevens. I translate on the basis of the glosses offered by Mp.

1518 These are the ancient brahmin rishis who were supposedly the composers of the Vedic hymns. They are mentioned in this capacity at 5:192, III 224,5-6, and 229,28-230,1, and at DN I 238,21-23, and MN II 169,29-31.

1519 The three editions have slightly different readings. I follow Ce cittālañkāram cittaparikkhāranti. Neither Be nor Ee have the quotation marker ti. Mp: "It is an ornament, an accessory, of the mind pertaining to serenity and insight" (samathavipassanācittassa).

1520 At 2:133 and 4:177 $\S 4$ she is held up as a model for the Buddha's female lay followers. She is probably identical with Uttarā Nandamātā, declared at 1:262 to be the foremost of meditators among female lay followers.

1521 Atitheyya: the traditional gift given to a guest as a token of hospitality.

1522 A comment is called for about the expression acchariyam abbhutam. Though often rendered "wonderful and marvelous," the phrase is not always intended to express appreciation but to suggest, rather, astonishment and amazement. Of course, the boundary line between the two senses is porous, as can be seen from the way the English words "wonderful" and "marvelous," which now have an appreciative sense, evolved from words connected with astonishment.

1523 Be and Ee read sallapissasī ti. Ce sallapissatī ti, in the third person, may be an editorial error.

1524 Be and Ee read vadhe vā vajjhamāne vā, Ce baddhe vā vajjhamāne $v \bar{a}$. The Sinhala translation in Ce mirrors the inconsistency of its Pāli text. I suggest reading, contrary to all three editions, baddhe $v \bar{a}$ bajjhamāne $v \bar{a}$. In this way the three pairs of phrases represent a sequence of arrest, imprisonment, and execution.

1525 Cittassa aññathattam. The expression recurs just below. My rendering is intended to fit both cases. In the present case a spiritually undeveloped woman would normally be distraught, in the case below she would be frightened.

1526 Yatra hi nāma cittuppādampi parisodhessasi. Lit., "that you will purify even the arising of mind."

1527 Yakkhayonim. Mp: "The spirit realm is the state of an earth-bound deity (bhummadevatābhāvaṃ)." Yoni is here used in the sense of "realm," and thus the expression yakkhayoni does not imply that yakkhas are born from the womb.

1528 This establishes her status as a non-returner, who has abandoned the five lower fetters but not the five higher fetters.

1529 The undeclared points (abyākatavatthūni) are ten matters that the Buddha has not addressed: whether or not the world is eternal, whether the world is finite or infinite, whether the life-principle is the same as the body or different from the body, and the four alternatives concerning the after-death status of the Tathāgata.

1530 Na chambhati, na kampati, na vedhati, na santāsaṃ āpajjati abyākatavatthūsu. Ce also has na calati, not in Be or Ee.

1531 Mp glosses purisagatiyo with purisassa ñāṇagatiyo, "a person's movement of knowledge." However, the sutta appears to be concerned principally with their destination (gati) after death. The Chinese parallel, MĀ 6 (T I 427a13-c24), renders the title of its Indian original (corresponding to satta purisagatiyo) as 七善人所往至處, meaning "seven places where good persons are reborn."

1532 No c'assa no ca me siyā, na bhavissati na me bhavissati. This cryptic formula occurs in the Nikāyas in two versions. One is ascribed to the annihilationists; the other is the Buddha's adaptation of it. The annihilationist version reads: no c'assam no ca me siyā, na bhavissāmi na me bhavissati, "I may not be, and it might not be mine. I will not be, and it will not be mine." Since the two differ only with respect to two verbs-no c'assam vs. no c'assa, and na bhavissāmi vs. na bhavissati-the various recensions sometimes confuse them. From the commentarial glosses, it appears that the confusion had already set in before the age of the commentaries. Readings also differ among different editions of the same text. Generally I prefer the readings in Ce.

This formula is explicitly identified as an annihilationist view (ucchedaditthi) at SN 22:81, III 99,4-6. In AN, at 10:29 §8,

V $63,28-64,2$, it is said to be the foremost of outside speculative views (etadaggaṃ bāhirakānaṃ ditṭhigatānaṃ). The Buddha transformed this formula into a theme for contemplation conformable to his own teaching by replacing the first-person verbs with their third-person counterparts. This change shifts the stress from the view of self implicit in the annihilationist version ("I will be annihilated") to an impersonal perspective that harmonizes with the anatta doctrine. In some texts, for example at SN 22:55, III 55-58, practicing on the basis of the formula is said to culminate in the destruction of the five lower fetters, that is, in the stage of a non-returner. Sometimes, as in the present sutta, the formula includes a trailer (see below), contemplation of which is said to lead to equanimity. Practice guided by the full formula leads to one of the five levels of non-returner or to arahantship.

In the Nikāyas the precise meaning of the formula is never made explicit, which suggests that it may have served as an open guide to contemplation to be filled in by the meditator through personal intuition. The commentaries, including Mp, take the truncated particle $c^{\prime}$ to represent $c e$, "if," and interpret the two parts of the formula as conditionals. I translate here from Mp (in conformity with its own interpretation): "If it had not been: If, in the past, there had been no kamma producing individual existence; it would not be mine: now I would have no individual existence. There will not be: Now there will be no kamma producing a future individual existence for me; there will not be mine: in the future there will be no individual existence for me."

I dissent from the commentaries on the meaning of $c^{\prime}$, which I take to represent $c a=$ "and." The syntax of the phrase as a whole requires this. Skt parallels actually contain ca (for instance, Udānavarga 15:4, parallel to Ud 78,1-3, has: no ca syān no ca me sy $\bar{a}[n]$; and MĀ 6 contains the character $\mathscr{\text { N }}$ (= "and") in the appropriate places of the formula. As I interpret the meaning, the first "it" refers to the personal five aggregates, the second to the world apprehended through the aggregates. For the worldling this dyad is misconstrued as a duality of self and world; for the noble disciple it is simply the duality of internal and external phenomena. On this basis I would interpret the formula thus: "The five aggregates can be terminated, and the world presented by them can be terminated. I will so strive that the five aggregates will be terminated, (and thus) the world presented by them will be terminated."

The trailer reads in Pāli: yadatthi yaṃ bhūtạ̣ taṃ pajahāmī ti upekkhaṃ paṭilabhati. Following Mp, I understand "what exists, what has come to be" (yadatthi yam bhūtam) as the presently
existing five aggregates. These have come to be through the craving of previous lives and are being abandoned by the abandonment of the cause for their re-arising in a future life, namely, craving or desire-and-lust.

1533 Atth'uttarim padam santam sammappaññāya passati. Mp: "He sees with path wisdom together with insight, There is a higher peaceful state, nibbāna."

1534 It is the continued presence of these three defilements that distinguishes the non-returner from the arahant, who has eliminated them.

1535 In accordance with the usual Theravāda commentarial position, Mp explains the antarāparinibbāy $\bar{\imath}$ as one who attains nibbānathe complete extinction of defilements-from the time immediately following rebirth up to the middle of the life span. This position seems contradicted by the similes to follow.

1536 The similes illustrate three types of antarāparinibbāy $\bar{\imath}$, "attainers of nibbāna in the interval." Although arguments based on similes are not always reliable, the three similes suggest that the "attainer of nibbāna in the interval" attains nibbāna before actually taking rebirth. Just as the three chips are extinguished after flying off from the red-hot bowl but before hitting the ground, so (on my interpretation) these three types attain final nibbāna respectively either right after entering the intermediate state, or during this state, or shortly before rebirth would take place. In this case, they immediately enter the nibbāna element without residue (anupādisesanibbānadhātu).

1537 Mp interprets this person as one who attains nibbāna between the midpoint of the life span and its end. However, the word upahacca, "having struck, having hit," and the simile of the chip that goes out on hitting the ground, suggest that this type is one who attains nibbāna almost immediately after rebirth.

1538 Whereas the standard Theravāda commentarial interpretation takes the next two types-one who attains nibbāna without exertion (asañkhāraparinibbāy $\bar{\imath}$ ) and one who attains nibbāna through exertion (sasañkhāraparinibbāyī)-to be two alternative ways by which the antarāparinibbāy $\bar{\imath}$ and upahaccaparinibbāy $\bar{\imath}$ attain the goal, the similes of the chip suggest, unambiguously, that the five types (or seven, counting separately the three subdivisions of the first) are distinct, forming a series from the sharper to the more sluggish. Thus if, as Mp alleges, the upahaccaparinibbāy $\bar{\imath}$ were one who attains nibbāna between the midpoint of the life span and its end, there would be no scope for the other two types, those who attain nibbāna without exertion and those who attain nibbāna through exertion.

1539 See p. 1701, note 828.

1540 Anupädisesā suvimuttā. Mp says that this refers to the five hundred bhikkhunīs of Mahāpajāpatt's retinue, who have been liberated without leaving any residue of clinging (upädānasesam atthapetvä). The discussion to follow in the sutta makes it clear that anupädisesa here means that they have eliminated all defilements without residue, not that they have attained the nibbāna element without residue (anupädisesanibbänadhātu).

1541 Of the seven types mentioned in $\S \S 1-7$, the first two, being arahants, have no residue of defilements; the other five, being trainees, have a residue of defilements.

1542 In the normal sevenfold classification of noble persons, the seventh person is the faith follower (saddhānusärī). Here, however, the seventh place is taken by the animittavihärī, "one who dwells in the markless." Mp says that the Buddha is actually describing the faith follower as one who practices strong insight (balavavipassakavasena). It explains that "all marks" are all marks of permanence and so forth, and the markless mental concentration (animittam cetosamādhim), as the concentration of strong insight (balavavipassanāsamädhim). Possibly Mp is attempting to rationalize a textual discrepancy, which might be indicative of a different understanding of the seventh noble person.

1543 This is an expanded parallel of 5:34, enlarged by partly incorporating the contents of 5:38.

1544 Mp : "They arouse compassion with the thought: 'Whom should we help today? Whose gift should we receive or to whom should we teach the Dhamma?'"

1545 This is a "composite seven," arrived at by combining a tetrad and a triad neither of which appears in AN as the theme of an independent sutta. The first tetrad, however, echoes 5:100.

1546 I read with Be and Ee tava sāvaka, as against Ce tathägatasāvaka.

1547 An expanded parallel of 5:201, 6:40.

1548 Pacalayamano nisinno hoti. Just below, Mp glosses the Buddha's question, "Pacalayasi no?" with "Niddayasi nu" ("Are you falling asleep?"). Mp: "While depending on the village for alms, Moggallana had been practicing meditation in the grove. For seven days he had energetically practiced walking meditation and the effort fatigued him. Thus he was dozing off [in the seat] at the end of the walkway."

1549 The following exchange is also at MN 37.2-3, I 251-52, but with Sakka as the inquirer. Mp explains the passage thus: "Nothing (lit., not all things) is worth holding to (sabbedhammā nālam abhinivesāya): here, 'all things' (sabbe dhammā) are the five aggregates, the twelve sense bases, and the eighteen elements. These
are not worth holding to by way of craving and views. Why not? Because they do not exist in the way they are held to. They are held to be permanent, pleasurable, and self, but they turn out to be impermanent, suffering, and non-self. Therefore they are not worth holding to. One directly knows them by the full understanding of the known (ñātaparī̄̄̄āya abhijānāti) as impermanent, suffering, and non-self. One fully understands them in the same way by the full understanding of scrutinization (tiranaparī̄̄āya parijānāti)." The "all things" in my translation from Mp relates to the "nothing" of the sutta, since the Palli phrase of the sutta is a negation of sabbe dhainm $\bar{a}$ ("not all things"). On the three kinds of full understanding (pariñ $\tilde{n} \bar{a}$ ), see Vism 606,18-607,23, Ppn 20.3-6.

1550 Ee does not count this as a separate sutta, though it encloses the whole sutta in brackets. The uddāna verse in Ee does not include a mnemonic for this sutta, which may explain the error. Ce uses $m \bar{a} p u \tilde{n} \tilde{n} a$ as the mnemonic; Be has mett $\bar{a}$ and titles it "Mettasutta."

1551 On the evolution of a new world system after a period of dissolution, see DN 1.2.2-4, I 17,24-18,4.

1552 Ce has in brackets sattakkhattum, "seven times," not in Be or Ee. The addition may have been intended to make the prose match the verse.

1553 This is a stock description of a wheel-turning monarch. On the seven gems, see MN 129.34-41, III 172-76.

1554 Ee has Jambusandassa, Ce Jambudīpassa (perhaps a normalization), Be Jambumandassa. Jambusandassa is at Sn 552 = Th 822. I. use the familiar name Jambudīpa, the "Rose-Apple Island," the greater Indian subcontinent.

1555 I read with Ce and Ee asāhasena dhammena, as against Be asāhasena kammena.

1556 Ce pathavyo [Ee pathabyo] yena vuccati. Be is less satisfactory: pathabyo me na vipajjati.

1557 I read with Ce and Ee homi here and in the first line of the next verse. Be has hoti in both places.

1558 The verse is also in 4:21.

1559 Vadhadandatajjitä. Mp: "When her husband grabs a rod and threatens her with murder, saying: 'I'll kill you'" (dandakam gahetvā vadhena tajjitā, "ghātessāmi nan" ti vuttā).

1560 There is a Chinese parallel, MĀ 129, at T I 617b19-618b16.

1561 Atho attham gahetvāna, anattham adhipajjati. So all three editions, but an older Sri Lankan edition has adhigacchati and a Siamese edition patipajjati. All three will work, but with different nuances. The line obviously represents the second danger of anger in the
prose portion. Mp says "having obtained something profitable, he thinks 'I have gotten what is harmful'" (vuddhim gahetvā... anattho me gahito ti sallakkheti). The Chinese counterpart at 618 a12 has 應獲得大財，反更得不利，"when he should have obtained great wealth, on the contrary he gets what is harmful."

1562 All three editions have vadham katvāna, "having slain," which I follow, but there is a variant, vanam katvāna, "having wounded." Mp seems to supports vadham with its gloss, "he commits the act of taking life" (pänatipātakammam katva). The Chinese at 618a15 has only 旗作身口業，"the angry person does a bodily or verbal deed."

1563 The versé presents several difficulties. Pāda a reads dummankuyam padasseti. Hardy, in his Preface to AN Vol. V (pp. v-vi), states that "dummanku signifies one who is staggering in a disagreeable, censurable, and scandalous manner, because he is not ashamed at his behavior, or the like." Mp glosses the word with dubbanṇamukhatam, "an ugly facial expression," which the Chinese (at 618a21) approximates with 發惡色. The verb in pāda c, patayati, is unclear. Mp glosses with nibbattati, "is produced," which is not sufficiently precise. PED offers "to be spread out" (perhaps from *sphātayati; see SED sv sphat), which I adopt. The Chinese 從是生憎嫉，"from this is produced hostile envy," may be based on a different word in its Indic original, perhaps spṛhayati (see SED sv sprh), which could have arisen from a corruption of something related to *sphātayati.

1564 Reading with Ce and Be yathatathaṃ, as against Ee yathākatham.

1565 Mp identifies "brahmin" here as an arahant (khināsavabrāhmanam).

1566 Hanti kuddho puthuttānam. I render this following Mp's gloss of puthuttānam with puthu nānākāraṇehi attānam.

1567 Bhünahaccāni kammāni. The commentaries consistently gloss bhūnahatā simply as hatavuddhi, "one who destroys growth." SED, sv bhrūna, lists bhrünahati as the killing of an embryo, and bhrünahaty $\bar{a}$ as the killing of a learned brahmin.

1568 Reading with Ce ekam etam akusalam, as against Be yathā metam akusalam and Ee ekam ekam akusalam. I take "this one unwholesome [quality]" to be anger.

1569 Reading with Ce vītamohā, as against Be and Ee vītalobhā, "without greed."

1570 Reading with Ce and Be parinibbanti, as against Ee parinibbiṃsu. A variant parinibbissatha yields a second-person plural utterance: "taintless, you will attain nibbāna."

1571 An expanded parallel of 5:24, 6:50.

1572 Be and Ee open with evam me sutam.

1573 The yojana is between seven and nine miles in length.

1574 Aññatra ditthapadehi. Mp: "Who will believe this, except the noble disciples, stream-enterers who have seen the truth?" The truth, or state (pada), seen by the stream-enterer is nibbāna, the cessation of suffering.

1575 Ko mantā ko saddhātā. Mp (Ce) glosses: "Who is able to discuss this for the sake of generating faith in this, or who has faith in this?" (ko tassa saddhāpanatthāya mantetuṃ samattho, ko vā tassa saddhātā). Saddhātā is nominative singular of the agent noun saddhātar. So mantā, which is parallel to it, must be an agent noun from mantar, "a thinker." The Chinese parallel, MĀ 8, has nothing corresponding to Pāli mantā. I translate from T I 429b7-11: "I now tell you, Sineru, the king of mountains, will collapse and be destroyed. Who can believe this, but those who have seen the truth? I now tell you, the waters of the great oceans will dry up and evaporate. Who can believe this, but those who have seen the truth? I now tell you, the great earth will entirely burn up and be destroyed by fire. Who can believe this, but those who have seen the truth?"

1576. He is also mentioned at 6:54, III 371,16-27.

1577 With this begins the six planes of sense-sphere heavens, from the highest down to the lowest.

1578 The Buddha relates this of himself with reference to his own past lives at 7:62.

1579 As at 4:1, including the verses.

1580 Salākañceva jevanikañca. Mp: "Salāka are weapons that can be released (nissaggiya), such as arrows and spears; jevanika are the other types of weapons, such as one-edge swords." SED sv śalyaka, gives "arrow, dart, spear." PED defines jevanika as "a kind of (missile) weapon," but missiles, according to Mp, are to be included under salaka.

1581 My renderings of these terms, sometimes obscure in the original, are partly based on the explanations given in Mp. Here are the explanations I follow for the terms that are not self-evident: Celakā ("standard-bearers"): those who, in the fighting, go in front carrying the standards of victory. Calaka ("camp marshals"): those who organize the military array thus: "Let this be the king's place, this is the place for the chief minister," etc. Pindadāyika ("food servers," lit., "lump-givers"): forceful great warriors. It is said that they enter the opponents' army and fly about cutting them up as if into lumps (pindapindamiva); having risen up, they come out; or else it is those who take food and drink to the warriors in the midst of the battle. [I have translated based on this second derivation, which seems more plausible.] Pakkhandhino ("front-line commandoes") are those who ask: "Whose head or weapon shall we bring?" and when told,
"His!" they leap (pakkhandanti) into the midst of battle and bring it. Mahānāga ("great-bull warriors") are warriors who cannot be turned back even when elephants, etc., are coming straight at them. Sürā ("attack-soldiers") are one type of hero, who can cross the ocean even while wearing a coat of mail or carrying armor. Cammayodhino ("shield-bearing soldiers") are those who wear a coat of leather mail, or who carry a leather shield as protection against arrows. Dāsakaputtā ("domestic-slave soldiers"): deeply affectionate domestic-slave soldiers. Mp explains uggā rājaputta as "royal sons experienced in battle who have risen higher and higher" (uggatuggatā sañgāmāvacara rāajaputtā). Mp thus derives the word from uggata, but SED says the ugra were "a mixed tribe (from a Kshatriya father and a Sūdra mother)." The word, according to SED, means "powerful, violent, mighty ... cruel, fierce."

1582 Aparitassāya. Lit., "for non-agitation."

1583 Tīlamuggamāsāparaṇ̣̣aṃ. Mp resolves thus: tīlamuggamāsā ca sesāparaṇañca. Following Mp, I take aparanna as a general term of which tila; mugga, and māsa are instances. Hence I render aparanna simply as "foodstuffs." See Sp IV 784,31-33: "By aparanna is meant green gram, beans, sesame, kulattha pulse, bitter gourd, pumpkin, and so forth" (muggamāsatilakulatthālābukumbhandādibhedañca aparannạ̣ adhippetạ̣).

1584 I would correct Ce dhammehi here to saddhammehi (as in Be and Ee). The Sinhala translation supports this with its rendering sapta saddharmayen.

1585 Dvayena puggalā viditā honti. Here a minor group of seven pairs is nested within the larger group of seven qualities, so that the discourse includes two sets of seven.

1586 DPPN explains that the pāricchattaka is a tree growing in the Nandana Grove in the Tāvatimsa heaven. It is a hundred leagues in circumference and at its foot is Sakka's stone seat. The päricchattaka is said to be one of seven trees that last throughout the eon. (I am grateful to Dr. Julie Plummer of the Department of Plant Biology, University of Western Australia, for providing precise botanical terms for the different stages of floral development referred to in this sutta.)

1587 Na cirass'eva dāni jālakajāto bhavissati. Mp: "The occasion when the tree gives birth to webs of leaves and flower, which come forth together."

1588 Na cirass'eva dāni khārakajāto bhavissati. Mp: "The occasion when it becomes possessed of a web of leaves and of flowers well divided and growing separately."

1589 Ce and Ee: kudumalakajāto; Be: kutumalakajāto. Mp: "It starts to bud."

1590 Ce and Ee: kokāsakajāto; Be: korakajāto. Mp: "It acquires flowers that have not yet blossomed, with closed mouths and large bellies."

1591 Ce: sabbapāliphullo; Be and Ee: sabbaphāliphullo. Mp: "It has flowered fully in all respects."

1592 The simile does not merely compare the noble disciple to a coral tree at its different stages but uses the name of the stage to describe the noble disciple's development. He is "a noble disciple at [such and such stage] like the Tāvatimsa devas' päricchattaka coral tree." Ee omits the va after devänam, though it acknowledges this as a variant reading.

1593 In a similar way, the cry of the deities, ascending through the celestial realms, occurs at the conclusion of the Buddha's first discourse. See SN 56:11, V 423,17-24,4.

1594 With Be and Ee, I read parisuddhasankhātatarā, as against Ce parisuddhasankhatatarā. Mp glosses "they will be purified and stainless to an even greater degree". (bhiyyosomattāya-parisuddha bhavissanti nimmalā), which I don't think quite captures the meaning of -sañkhātatarā. The word can mean "known as, appearing to be, declared to be," and this is the sense that seems relevant here.

1595 This sutta is a part-parallel of SN 22:101, III 152-55.

1596 I read with Ee udaram, as against Ce and Be uram, "chest."

1597 See SN 12:22, II 29,16-21.

1598 Mp , commenting on 1:53, discusses this passage more fully as follows: "Those bhikkhus who vomited hot blood had committed pārājika offenses. Those who returned to lay life had been going around violating the lesser and minor training rules. And those who attained arahantship had purified their behavior. The Teacher's discourse was fruitful for all three. [Question:] Granted it was fruitful for those who attained arahantship, how was it fruitful for the others? [Reply:] Because if they had not heard this discourse, [the first kind] would have become heedless and would not have been able to abandon their condition. Their evil behavior would have increased and dragged them down to the realms of misery. But when they heard this discourse, they were filled with a sense of urgency. Having abandoned their condition, some became sāmaneras (novices), fulfilled the ten precepts, applied themselves to careful attention, and became stream-enterers, once-returners, or non-returners, while some were reborn in the deva world. Thus it was fruitful even for those who had committed pārā̄ikas. If the others had not heard this discourse, as time went on, they would have gradually committed sanghā̄disesas and pārā̄ikas. They would have been reborn in
the realms of misery and experienced great suffering. But having heard it, thinking that they could not fulfill the practice all their lives, they gave up the training and returned to lay life. They became settled in the three refuges, observed the five precepts, fulfilled the duty of a lay follower, and became stream-enterers, once-returners, or non-returners, while some were reborn in the deva world. Thus the discourse was fruitful for them, too."

1599 As at 6:54, where, however, the chain of past teachers ends at Jotipāla. See too 7:66, where Sunetta alone is mentioned.

1600 I read with Be and Ee yathā 'mam sabrahmacärīsu, as against Ce yathā amham sabrahmacärīsu. Ce has yathā 'mam in the parallel at 6:54. See too pp. 1762-63, notes 1364-66.

1601 The text uses ratti, "night" as the reckoning for a twenty-fourhour period, as is common in Buddhist canonical literature.

1602 Reading with Ce and Ee kupito, as against Be kapimiddho, "monkey sleep."

1603 I follow Ce and Be, which read rattipi sañkhātā, divāpi sañkhātā.

1604. Sp IV 790,12-20: "In detail means together with both Vibhangas. Well transmitted means transmitted well. To show how they have been 'well transmitted,' it is said, 'well analyzed' and so forth. Well analyzed means that each term is analyzed without confusion or fault. Well mastered means made familiar, coming up in recitation. Well determined in terms of rule means determined well in terms of the rule to be cited from the Khandhakas and Parivāra; well determined in terms of detailed explication means well determined, flawless, without error in wording through the completeness of words and terms." (Tattha vitthärenā ti ubhatovibhangena saddhim. Svāgatānī ti sutthu āgatāni. Yathā āgatāni pana svāgatāni honți, tam dassetum "suvibhattānī"ti ādi vuttam. Tattha suvibhattānī ti suț̣̣hu vibhattāni padapaccäbhaṭthasañkaradosavirahitāni. Suppavattīni ti pagunāni vācuggatāni. Suvinicchitānisuttasolikhandhakaparivāratoāharitabbasuttavasena sutthu vinicchitāni. Anubyañjanaso ti akkharapadapāripūriyā ca suvinicchitāni akhandāni aviparītakkharāni.)

1605 I follow Be in reading simply vinayadharo rather than bhikkhu vinayadharo in 7:79-82. Ce has bhikkhu vinayadharo in 7:79 and 7:80, opening statement, and just vinayadharo in 7:80, closing statement, and in 7:81-82. Ee has bhikkhu vinayadharo in 7:79 (= Ee lxxv) and just vinayadharo in 7:80-82 (= Ee lxxvi-lxxviii).

1606 Sammukhāvinaya. In view of the detailed explanation at Vin II $93,32-100,6$, the rendering in MLDB 855-56, "removal by confrontation," is not satisfactory.

1607 For details on these principles and their applications, see MN 104.13-20, II 247-50; Vin II 73-104; Thānissaro 2007a: 546-61.

1608 Ee does not count this as a separate vagga but treats it as the beginning of the repetition series.

1609 A pun is involved here, evident in the Pāli: bhinnattā bhikkhu hoti. Puns also explain the word derivations in the following suttas, for example, samitattā samano hoti, and bāhitattā brāhmaño hoti. These puns are purely "pedagogical" and not etymologically cogent.

1610 Each of the suttas in this series is abridged in the Pāli, but it is clear that each should be expanded by way of the seven factors mentioned in 4:85.

1611 I read with Ee arīhatattā. Ce has arahattā, Be ārakattā (as all three editions read in the next sutta).

1612 Arakattā arahā hoti.

1613 No edition has an uddāna verse for this vagga. From this point on Be stops giving individual titles to the suttas, as Ee had done earlier. I base the titles on Ce, which does not, however, have an uddāna verse.

1614 Neither Ce nor Ee numbers this series. Be numbers it 11, continuing the consecutive numbering scheme used for the vaggas. I have numbered it as if it were a sixth chapter in this set of fifty. Ce numbers the suttas in the series from 1-510. Be numbers the suttas in continuation with those in the entire nipāta, from 623 to 1132 . I follow the sutta numbering of Be .

# Notes to the Eights

1615 Amanussā. Lit. "nonhumans." The word primarily refers to earthbound deities, yakkhas, and demons. Vism 312,9-313,18 (Ppn 9.64-69), illustrates this benefit with a story about a monk who wins the affection of tree deities.

1616 Sabbe ca pāne manasānukampī. Anukampā (the abstract noun of anukampī) has a slightly different nuance than karunā, the second immeasurable quality. Anukampā usually suggests compassion as a motive for action on behalf of others, whereas karunā generally designates a meditative state.

1617 I translate on the basis of the Be and Ee reading assamedham, which accords with the name of the first of this traditional group of sacrifices mentioned elsewhere in the Nikāyas. At 4:39 these sacrifices are condemned for the harm they inflict on helpless creatures. Ce here reads sassamedham, "the corn sacrifice," the gloss found in Mp (both Ce and Be). The gloss is perhaps apologetic, intended to justify the ascription of this sacrifice to the royal sages.

1618 These are the names of other sacrifices.

1619 Reading with Be and Ee tāragaṇā va, as against Ce tāragaṇā ca.

1620 Mettamso sabbabhūtānaṃ veram tassa na kenaci. Mp takes mettamso to be a compound of mett $\bar{a}$ and amso, glossing it mettāyamänacittakotṭhāso, "a portion of a loving mind." BHSD sv amśa testifies to the occurrence of maitra amśa in BHS literature; maitreñamśena sphuritvā in Divyāvadāna 60.24 and 61.12.

1621 Ādibrahmacariyikāya paññāya. Mp: "[This is] insight, the wisdom that is the basis for the spiritual life of the path" (maggabrahmacariyassa ādibhūtāya paññāyā ti vipassanāya).

1622 Ariyam vā tuṇhībhāvam nātimaññati. Lit., "or he does not look down on noble silence."

1623 Piyattāya garuttāya bhāvanāya sāmaññāya ekibhāvāya samvattati. Mp glosses bhāvanāya here with bhāvanatthāya gunasambhāvanāya vā, "toward [meditative] development or toward esteem for virtues." The latter meaning seems to fit the context better. Mp glosses sāmaññāya with samanadhammatthāya, "for the sake of the ascetic's duty," but I think it more likely that sāmañña is an abstract noun from samāna, meaning "the same" or "similar." I translate it as "accord," which agrees well with the following word ekibhāvāya. PED lists sāmañña as meaning "conformity" and "unity." The word occurs in this sense as the name of the fifth vagga of the Second Fifty (see p. 1237 below). No Chinese parallel is listed, but see pp. 1848-49, note 2106.

1624 An expanded parallel of 7:1. Though they use the same framework, 8:4 is not exactly an expanded parallel of 7:2.

1625 Asuci. Mp says only "he is possessed of impure bodily action, etc."

1626 Devadatta had created a schism in the Sangha and left with his own company of monks, intending to establish a rival order.

1627 Yạ̣ kiñci subhāsitam sabbạ̣ tam tassa bhagavato vacanam arahato sammāsambuddhassa. Tato upādāy'upādāya māyañ c'aññe ca bhaṇāma. This could not be translated, "Whatever is the word of the Blessed One . . . is well spoken." As stated, it expresses the idea that whatever good teachings the disciples speak, even when they themselves have originated them, can be regarded as buddhavacana because they are based on the Buddha's own teachings.

1628 It is probable that this sutta was put in the Eights because of the eight bad conditions mentioned in the discourse about Devadatta.

1629 It is hard to see on what basis Sakka says that this exposition of the Dhamma had not been established anywhere among the four assemblies (n'āyam dhammapariyāyo kismīñci patitṭhito). The discourse on knowing one's own failings and achievements had already been taught to the bhikkhus, who are likely to have taught it to the other three assemblies.

1630 Nanda, the Buddha's half-brother, apparently had strong sensual desires. After he became a monk he constantly thought of his fiancée and later hoped to be reborn among the celestial nymphs. His story is told at Ud 3:2, 21-24.

1631 At 4:41, this is called the development of concentration that leads to mindfulness and clear comprehension.

1632 Aññenāññam paticarati, bahiddhā katham apanāmeti, kopañca dosañca appaccayañca pātukaroti.

1633 I read with Ce and Be niddhamath'etam . . niddhamath'etam, as against Ee dhamath'etam...niddhamath'etam.

1634 All readings of this sentence seem confused. Ce has kim vo paraputto vihethiyati, where the passive verb does not seem to fit. Ee has kim vo paraputtā vihetheti, which links a plural subject to an active singular verb. Be has kim vo tena parapuitena visodhitena, "What do you have [to do] with that son of another who has been purified?" which makes no sense in this context. Ee includes still more variants in its footnotes. I take the required reading to be: kim vo paraputto vihetheyya. Mp does not offer an explanation, but the implication seems to be that the troublesome monk, by his behavior, is not a real disciple of the Buddha and thus can be considered a "son" (that is, a disciple) of another teacher.

1635 Aññesam bhaddakānam bhikkhūnam. I assume that it is the above eight modes of behavior that account for the classification of this sutta among the Eights.

1636 Kuṭhāripāsena. DOP is uncertain about the meaning but suggests it might be the ring or blade of the axe. PED has "throw of an axe."

1637 Nalerupucimandamüle. Sp I 108,29-30 says that Naleru was the name of a yakkha.

1638 A similar rebuike against the Buddha is voiced at 4:22.

1639 Arasarūpo bhavam Gotamo. Mp: "The brahmin, lacking wisdom, did not recognize that the Buddha was the eldest in the world. Utterly unwilling to accept the Buddha's statement, he spoke thus, referring to the 'taste of concord' (sämaggirasa), which in the world means paying homage, standing respectfully, reverential salutation, and polite conduct. To soften his mind, the Blessed One avoids directly contradicting him; instead he states that the term applies to him, but intending this in a different sense. [The Buddha speaks of 'taste'] as the gratification in sensual pleasure that arises in worldlings-even in those considered the best by way of class or rebirth-who relish, welcome, and lust after objects such as forms, etc."

1640 Nibbhogo bhavam Gotamo. Mp says that the brahmin intended this in the sense that the Buddha lacks "the enjoyment of concord"
(sāmaggiparibhogo, conviviality), by which he again refers to such respectful gestures as paying homage to elders, etc. But the Buddha speaks with reference to the lustful enjoyment of sensual pleasures that arises in ordinary beings.

1641 Akiriyavädo bhavam Gotamo. The doctrine of non-doing, as expressed by its proponents, denies the distinction between good and evil. See DN 2.17, I 52,22-53,2; MN 60.13, I 404,21-35; MN 76.10, I 516,3-17; SN 24.6, III 208,20-209,6. Mp says that the brahmin intended this in the sense that the Buddha did not act in accord with convention, as by paying homage to his elders, etc. But the Buddha spoke with reference to the non-doing of. bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct.

1642 Ucchedavädo bhavam Gotamo. The annihilationists proclaimed "the annihilation, destruction, and extermination" of a truly existent person at death. See DN 1.3.9-16, I 34,2-35,36. Mp says that the brahmin intended to accuse the Buddha of seeking to annihilate the long-established conventions of paying homage to elders, etc., but the Buddha spoke with reference to the annihilation of all defilements and unwholesome qualities by the four noble paths.

1643 Jegucchi bhavam Gotamo. Mp: "The brahmin calls the Blessed One a 'repeller' (jegucchī); he thinks that because the Buddha is repelled (jigucchati) by polite conduct such as paying homage to elders, he does not do such things. But the Blessed One acknowledges this in a metaphorical sense. He is repelled by bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct and by the various bad unwholesome qualities, just as a man fond of ornaments would be repelled and disgusted by feces."

1644 Venayiko bhavan Gotamo. Venayika, from the verb vineti (to discipline, to remove), can mean "one who imposes discipline, one who trains others." But in the Buddha's time the word venayika also seems to have acquired the meaning of "one who leads astray," who leads others to destruction. Thus Mp glosses vineti, in the brahmin's view, with vināseti, "destroys." But the Buddha affirms this in the sense that he teaches the Dhamma for the removal of lust and other defilements (rāgädīnam vinayāya).

1645 Tapassi bhavam Gotamo. A tapassi is usually an ascetic devoted to self-torment. The word is derived from the verb tapati, "to burn up, to heat up." The brahmin, according to Mp, uses the word in the sense of one who torments elders by not showing proper respect to them. But the Buddha uses the term to mean that he burns up unwholesome qualities.

1646 Apagabbho bhavam Gotamo. SED explains Skt apagalbha as "wanting in boldness, embarrassed, perplexed" (see too DOP sv
apagabbha). The Buddha plays on the word as if it meant "rid of (apa) the womb (gabbha)." It is nearly impossible to capture this pun in translation; my use of "retiring" is a clumsy attempt to bridge the two senses: "timid" and "retired" from wandering through the round of rebirths.

1647 See 4:128 $\S 4$.

1648 Following Be and Ee, I give the first two knowledges in full. Ce abridges them.

1649 I do not follow Ce, which here includes ditthāsava, the taint of views, absent in Be or Ee. The parallel passages in Ce at 3:59, 4:198, etc., do not include ditthāsava.

1650 It is strange that Mahāvīra (the Niganṭha Nātaputta) is depicted as making such a statement: The Jains certainly must have known that the Buddha also taught a doctrine of kamma, though different from their own. Mp says that Nātaputta was extremely displeased at Sīha's request and thought to prevent him from going. His words "destroyed the joy that had arisen in Sīha, as if striking a stray bull with a stick, extinguishing a burning lamp, or turning over a bowl of food."

1651 I read with Be and Ee: yannūnāham anapaloketvā va niganṭhe, as against Ce yannūnāham anapalokitā va niganṭhe. In the previous sentence, with niganṭh $\bar{a}$ as subject, the past participles apalokit $\bar{a}$ vā anapalokitā vā are appropriate as nominatives in agreement with the subject. In this sentence, where aham is the subject, an absolutive signifying an act of Sīha is preferable.

1652 See p. 1646, note 416.

1653 In 8:11 accusations $\S \S 1,3-7$ are leveled against the Buddha.

1654 Ce and Be have assāsako; Ee reads assattho, which means "consoled." I am not quite sure how this is intended as a criticism.

1655 Mp: "Supreme consolation (paramena assāsena): the four paths and four fruits."

1656 What follows here, up to "and become independent of others in the teaching of the Teacher," closely matches Upāli's experience at MN 56.16-18, I 379,2-380,10.

1657 This charge is also addressed at 3:57.

1658 Ce and Ee jiranti; Be jiridanti. Mp: "They do not limit their slander (abbhakkhānassa antan na gacchanti). Or else, this word jiridanti means shame (lajjanatthe). The meaning is that they are not ashamed (na lajjanti)."

1659 See the Jīvaka Sutta (MN 55) for the Buddha's position on meateating. It is curious, indeed almost disingenuous, that the Buddhist texts depict the Jains as criticizing the Buddha for eating meat from an animal killed especially for him. This charge plays right into the Buddhists' protest that the Buddha is being slandered and their rejoinder that he would never intentionally have
a living being killed for his meal. But as the Jains were strict vegetarians, we can be almost certain that they criticized the Buddha and his disciples, not for having an animal killed for their meal, but simply for consuming meat. On the Jain prohibition of meat-eating, see http://www.jainworld.com/jainbooks/ guideline/28.htm.

1660 In Ee, so rato should be read without the hiatus as sorato.

1661 Also at 2:5.

1662 Pitthito ratham pavatteti. Mp: "Pushing the yoke up with its shoulder bone, it retreats, turning the chariot around with its backside."

1663 Pacchā langhati, kubbaram hanati, tidandam bhanjjati. Mp: "It kicks up its two hind legs, strikes the chariot's rail, and damages the rail. It breaks the triple rod, the three rods in front of the chariot."

1664 Rathīsāya satthim ussajjitvā rathisamyeva ajjhomaddati. Mp: "Having lowered its head, it throws the yoke to the ground and strikes the chariot pole with its thigh and crushes the chariot pole with its two front feet."

1665 I follow Ce and Ee, which here and below read patodam, as against Be patodalatthi, "goad and whip."

1666 Anutthānamala gharā. Lit., "Houses have lack of initiative as their stain." Mp: "The stain of houses is the lack of initiative, the absence of energy." Mp-t: "This is said because a house goes to ruin if one does not repeatedly take the initiative in repairing what has decayed and so forth."

1667 The verses are at Dhp 241-43ab. Dhp 243cd adds: "Having abandoned these stains, be stainless, O bhikkhus" (etam malam pahatvāna nimmala hotha bhikkhavo).

1668 Vanabhangena. Lit., "by what is broken [from] the woods." Mp: "By a present, such as flowers or fruits, which are taken from the woods and brought to him."

1669 I translate on the basis of Ce and Ee. Be, in this sutta and the next, has a different eight means of binding, occurring in a different sequence, namely: by weeping, by a smile, by speech, by appearance, by a present, by scent, by taste, by touch (rumnena, hasitena, bhanitena, ākappena, vanabhangena, gandhena, rasena, phassena). Thus, apart from the change of sequence, Be replaces "form" and "singing" of Ce and Ee with "scent" and "taste." According to Mp, "appearance" (akappa) means "the manner of dressing and so forth," but this may be too narrow. The Chinese parallel at EĀ II 765c24-766a2 lists nine ways a woman binds a man: by singing, dancing, her skills, her touch, her smile, weeping, an expedient means, beautifying her face and body, and her appearance and deportment.

1670 I read with Ce and Be subaddhā yeva phassena baddhā. Ee has a variant reading here and in the next sutta: subaddha yeva pāsena baddhā, "[they are] thoroughly bound who are bound by a snare."

1671 This last phrase is commonly rendered "with a sudden drop-off only after a long stretch." But the Pāli na äyataken'eva papäto, with the negative particle $n a$, actually means the opposite: that there is no sudden drop-off. See DOP sv ayataka, instr. ayatakena, "suddenly, abruptly; of a sudden." Mp explains: "It doesn't drop off at once like a steep precipice or deep pit. Beginning at the shore, it grows deeper by inches, feet, yards, [and successively longer measures] until it is 84,000 yojanas deep at the base of Mount Sineru."

1672 The first three are legendary fish of gigantic size.

1673 Anupubbasikkha, anupubbakiriyā, anupubbapatipada. I take these to be truncated instrumentals relative to aññäpativedho. Mp glosses them with anupubbasikkhāya, etc. Mp correlates each term with a set of training factors: "By gradual training the three trainings are included (see 3:89); by gradual activity, the thirteen ascetic practices (see Vism chap. 2); and by gradual practice, the seven contemplations, the eighteen great insights (see Vism 694,3-27, Ppn 22.113), the thirty-eight meditation objects, and the thirtyseven aids to enlightenment. Penetration to final knowledge occurs ...not abruptly (na ayataken'eva aññäpativedho): there is no penetration to arahantship all at once (ädito va) like the hopping of a frog, without having fulfilled virtuous behavior and so forth. One is able to attain arahantship only after having fulfilled in due order (paṭipätiya) virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom." See too MN I 479.

1674 Na tena nibbänadhātuyā ūnattam va purattam va paññayati. Mp: "When no Buddhas have arisen in countless eons, it is not possible for even one being to attain nibbāna. Yet one cannot say, 'The nibbāna element is empty.' And during the time of a Buddha, when countless beings attain the deathless at a single assembly, one cannot say, 'The nibbāna element has become full.'"

1675 An unabridged version of this sutta, with a verse attached at the end, is Ud 5:5, 51-56. It is also at Vin II 236-40, where it serves as the background story to the rules about suspending a bhikkhu's right to participate in the Pātimokkha recitation.

1676 I read with Ce ägamessati, as against Be and Ee ägamissati.

1677 At 1:253 he is declared the foremost among those who give what is agreeable. At 5:44 he makes agreeable offerings to the Buddha.

1678 Brahmacariyapañcamāni sikkhāpadāni, These are the usual five
precepts, but with "abstinence from sexual activity" replacing "abstinence from sexual misconduct" as the third precept.

1679 As at 7:53 57. With this he declares himself a non-returner.

1680 This is an alternative way of declaring oneself to be a nonreturner. By saying that he will not return to "this world" (imam lokami) he indicates that he has eliminated the five lower fetters, which bind one to this world of sensual desire, and also that he is not yet an arahant, who does not return to any state of being.

1681 While Hatthaka is said to be dwelling in a residence (nivesana), unlike the preceding two lay followers, he is not addressed here as "householder" (gahapati) but as "friend" (avuso). Whether this is intentional or a transmission error is impossible to determine. At 6:123, however, Hatthaka is referred to as a householder (gahapati) whereas some of the other lay disciples in this vagga are called lay followers (upāsaka).

1682 The text repeats everything from the bhikkhu's going to Hatthaka's house up to the end of their conversation.

1683 Mentioned at 4:32 and 4:256.

1684 Daliddassa kho no tathā sotabbam maññanti. Mp: "They do not listen to me as they would to a poor man, who cannot give anything or do anything; but they think they should listen to me and follow my advice and do not think they should transgress my instructions."

1685 Jivaka was the Buddha's personal physician. For his background story, see Vin I 268-80.

1686 It seems that the two Pāli words ujjhatti and nijjhatti are being intentionally played off against one another. Mp glosses ujjhattibala with ujjhanabala and explains: "For fools have only the power of complaining: 'When that fellow said this and that, he said it to me, not to anyone else.' But [the wise] have the power of inference, of inferring what is beneficial and what is harmful: 'This is not so, hence it is that.'" On nijjhatti and its verb, nijjhāpeti, see 2:51.

1687 Reading with Ce vavakattham, rather than vivekattham with Be and Ee. Vavakattha is past participle of vavakassati. PED gives as meanings, "drawn away, alienated, withdrawn, secluded."

1688 Khanakicco loko. Lit., "moment-task world." Mp: "One does one's tasks at the moment. Having gained this opportunity, one does one's tasks."

1689 Dighāyukan devánikāyam. Mp: "This is said with reference to the order of non-percipient devas (asaññam devanikāyam)." However, it also seems to apply to the devas of the formless realm, who (because they lack bodies) cannot hear the Buddha or his
disciples teach the Dhamma and thus cannot attain even the path of stream-entry.

1690 Saddhammassa niyämatam. Mp glosses as the noble path (ariyam maggam).

1691 I read with Ce and Ee märadheyyasarānuge, as against Be märadheyyaparanuge. Mp: "That accompany samsāra, called 'Māra's realm'" (märadheyyasañkhātạ̣ samsāraṃ anugate).

1692 Mp: "After going forth, in his first rains retreat Anuruddha gained the meditative attainments and obtained the knowledge of the divine eye by which he could see a thousand world systems. He went to Sāriputta for advice ... and Sāriputta explained a meditation subject to him. He learned the meditation subject, took leave of the Buddha, and went to the Ceti country, where for eight months he passed the time engaged in walking meditation. His body became fatigued with the effort, so he sat down in a bamboo thicket. Then this course of thought arose in him."

1693 Nippapañcārāmassāyaṃ dhammo nippapañcaratino, nāyaṃ dhammo papañcärämassa papañcaratino. Mp: "[This Dhamma is] for one 'who delights in non-proliferation,' who takes delight in the state of nibbāna, called 'non-proliferation' because it is devoid of proliferation by craving, conceit, and views" (tanhāmānadiṭthipapañcarahitattā nippapañcasañkhāte nibbānapade abhiratassa). On papañca, see too 4:173.

1694 I read with Ce vavakatthena, as against Be and Ee vivekatthena. PED says that vavakattha and vüpakattha are alternative forms of the same word. Both are distinct from vivekattha, "firm in seclusion." Since compounds with viveka precede this word, it is easy to see how the original word could have undergone mutation. See p. 1797, note 1687.

1695 Included among Anuruddha's verses at Th 901-3.

1696 The fifth, sixth, and eighth motives for giving are also at 7:52.

1697 Āsajja dānam deti. Mp: "One gives a gift when someone has arrived. Having seen one who has come, one instantly makes him sit down, honors him, and gives him a gift. One thinks, 'I will give,' but does not trouble him." This explanation takes āsajja to be the absolutive of āsīdati, glossed by Mp as nisīdāpetvā, "having made sit down." In the Nikāyas, however, āsajja never seems to bear this sense but always means "having insulted, having offended, having encroached upon." Since this type of giving occurs first in what is clearly a graded list, the usual meaning of āsajja is more pertinent.

1698 All three editions have cittālañkāracittaparikkhārattham dānaṃ deti. See 7:52, where Ce has cittālañkāraṃ cittaparikkhāranti dānaṃ deti.

Mp: "For the purpose of ornamenting and equipping the mind with serenity and insight."

1699 It is likely that this sutta was originally a verse attached to the preceding one, which at some point was broken off and treated as separate. In its present form, it contains no set of eight factors to account for its inclusion in the Eights.

1700 Dānavatthūni. Mp: dānakāranāni, "causes for giving."

1701 Reading with Be and Ee bhaya $\bar{a}$ dānam deti; Ce has garahā dānam deti, "one gives a gift from criticism," perhaps with the implication "from fear of criticism."

1702 In translating these verses, I alternate between "accomplishment" and "excellence" as renderings for sampad $\bar{a}$, and "accomplished" and "excellent" as renderings for sampanna. In each case I have let my sense of natural English diction.determine the appropriate choice.

1703 The text has tassa tam cittam, but "aspiration" works better here than "mind" for cittam.

1704 I read with Be hine 'dhimuttam (= hine adhimuttam), shared by a Siamese edition. Ce and Be have hine vimuttam, which must have been the reading in Mp. Mp-t glosses: "Released upon is resolved upon, which means 'bent on, inclining toward, leaning toward'" (vimuttan ti adhimuttam, ninnaṃ ponam pabbhāranti attho). Mp: "The inferior (hina) is the five objects of sensual pleasure."

1705 Vitarāgassa, no sarāgassa. This is added because rebirth in the brahmā world requires more than the practice of generosity. It must also be supported by the attainment of jhāna, which arises through the fading away of craving for sensual pleasures.

1706 See 5:148. The only common factor between the five qualities mentioned there and those listed here is giving at the proper time.

1707 This is an expanded parallel of 5:42, but with different verses.

1708 Mp glosses pubbe with pathamameva, but I suspect it is an abridgment of pubbapeta, mentioned in the prose. I translate on the basis of this supposition.

1709 I read these verses as consisting of two six-pāda stanzas and one four-pāda stanza. Ce and Be both divide them into four fourpāda stanzas. Be does not divide them into stanzas.

1710 I read with Be and Ee ñatva dhamme ca pesalo, as against Ce ñatva dhamme'dha pesale.

1711 Apace brahmacārayo. Mp glosses as if apace represents apacayati, "to honor": brahmacarino apacayati, nīcavuttiiam nesam āpajjati. However, DOP takes apaca to mean "not cooking," and thus signifying homeless. I follow this with my rendering "mendicants."

1712 See 4:51-52, 5:45.

1713 On the noble ones' uposatha observance, see 3:70.

1714 These verses are identical with those at 3:70.

1715 Of the three editions, only Ee has sace ceteyyum, which is consistent with the reading of the parallel at 4:193, II 194,24-25.

1716 In relation to 5:33, Mp identifies these deities with the "devas who delight in creation" (nimmānaratino devā). Mp relates the origin of the present sutta thus: "It is said that those deities, having examined their own glory, asked themselves: 'How did we obtain such glory?' Reflecting, they saw Anuruddha and knew: 'In the past, when he was a wheel-turning monarch, we were his consorts. We accepted his guidance and thus we have obtained this glory. Let's go. We will bring the elder and [together] we will enjoy (anubhavissāma) this glory.' Thus during the day they approached Anuruddha."

1717 Suppatipatālitassa. Patipatālita is not in PED, but SED sv prati > pratitāla, explained as."in music, a kind of measure." Mp (Ce) glosses suppatipatālitassa as pamānena thitabhāvajānanattham sutthu patipatālitassa, which I would translate: "well coordinated for the purpose of maintaining a particular measure."

1718 Tā devatā 'na khvayyo anuruddho sādiyatī' ti tatth'ev'antaradhāyimsu. Mp: "[The deities thought:] 'Master Anuruddha does not enjoy our dancing and singing. He closes his eyes and refuses to look at us. Why should we go on dancing and singing?' Then they disappeared right there."

1719 The first five items here are substantially identical with those mentioned at 5:33, except for the grammatical changes needed to adapt to the context.

1720 I read with Ee rajatam vā jātarūpam vā, as at 5:33. Neither Ce nor Be includes rajatam here but all three editions include it at 8:49 just below.

1721 I read with Be and Ee (and Ce at 5:33) sabbakāmaharam, as against Ce sabbakämadam here.

1722 All three editions read here issāvādena. In contrast, in 5:33 the three read this phrase differently. See p. 1726, note 1010.

1723 This sutta can be considered a composite, since the eight items are reached by combining two tetrads.

1724 Mp explains ayam'sa loko āradāho hoti thus: Ayam assa loko idhaloke karanamattāya āraddhattā paripuṇnattā āraddho hoti paripuṇno ("This world succeeds for her and is fulfilled because she succeeds and reaches fulfillment simply by doing [what is to be done] in the présent world").

1725 Following Ee, I have filled out the text, abridged in Ce and Be.

1726 Solasākārasampannā. The reference is not immediately clear from the text itself. Mp: "The eight stated in the sutta, and the eight in
the stanzas, make sixteen aspects. Or the eight she herself possesses, and the [same] eight in which she enjoins others, make sixteen aspects."

1727 This sutta, the canonical account of the founding of the Bhikkhunī Sangha, has been the subject of extensive scholarly investigations. The narrative also occurs at Vin II 253-56. Several recent studies on the sutta, from a critical perspective, are in Mohr and Tsedroon 2010. Particularly instructive in this collection is Ute Hüsken, "The Eight Garudhammas," and Anālayo, "Women's Renunciation in Early Buddhism: The Four Assemblies and the Foundation of the Order of Nuns," which treats the chronological problem at pp. 86-90.

1728 The chronology is unclear to me. Mp 'says that at the time this sutta begins the Buddha was living among the Sakyans during his first return journey to Kapilavatthu (pathamagamanena gantva viharati). Yet, given that Mahāpajāpatī could go forth only after the death of her husband, the Buddha's father Suddhodana, and that it seems improbable Suddhodana died during the Buddha's first return visit to Kapilavatthu, which took place soon after his enlightenment, this fact is hardly credible. It would also lead to an odd anachronism. The Cūlavagga reports that Ānanda and other prominent Sakyans became monks after the Buddha's first journey to Kapilavatthu (Vin II 182-83). Ānanda became the Buddha's attendant twenty years after the enlightenment, when the Buddha was fifty-five, and served the Buddha in this capacity for twenty-five years, right up until the end of his master's life (Th 1041-43). In this sutta, however, Ā nanda is depicted as the Buddha's attendant before the founding of the Bhikkhunī Sangha. Whether this event occurred shortly after the Buddha's first return trip to Kapilavatthu, or even five or ten years later, it would still be too early for Ānanda to be serving as his attendant. Thus, unless Ānanda was not actually the Buddha's attendant at the time, there seems to be a chronological tension between the situation depicted in the sutta and the likely period when women first obtained ordination.

1729 I summarize the sequence of events from Mp. When the Buddha returned to Kapilavatthu, he gave the going forth to Nanda and Rāhula and later resolved a conflict between the Sakyans and their neighbors, the Koliyans (the Buddha's relatives on his mother's side). Following this, 250 young men from each side left the home life under the Buddha. After a while, they began to pine for their wives. The Buddha brought them to the Kunāla Lake, where he taught them the Kunāla Jātaka on the wiles and deceitfulness of women. On hearing this, the five hundred young
monks attained stream-entry and shortly afterward became arahants. Their wives sent them messages entreating them to return home, but they replied that they were now incapable of living the household life. The women therefore went to Mahāpajāpatī and asked her to request the Buddha, her stepson, to allow women to go forth. Mahāpajāpatī took the women under her wing, went to the Buddha, and made this request.

1730 Mp : "Why does he refuse her? Isn't it the case that all Buddhas have four assemblies? This is true, but he refuses her with the thought that if women are given permission to go forth only after they have made repeated efforts, they will maintain their ordination and revere it, recollecting how difficult it was to obtain the going forth."

1731 These were the five hundred Sakyan women whose husbands had gone forth and attained arahantship. In a personal communication, Pruitt writes: "There's no indication of how much time elapsed between the Buddha's departure and what follows here. In Thī-a 3, [the commentator] Dhammapāla says, 'He had the young Nanda and the young Rahula go forth and then the Teacher returned again to Rājagaha. On a later occasion, when the Teacher was living in the Kūtāgāra Hall near Vesālī, the great King Suddhodana attained final quenching [nibbāna], having realized arahantship even while he was still [reigning] under the white parasol. The inclination to go forth arose in Mahā-Pajāpatí' (Pruitt 1998: 6-7). This is also given at Thī-a 141 (Pruitt 1998: 181). King Suddhodana is the only layman I know of who became an arahant and remained a layman, which means he could not have lived more that seven days after becoming an arahant."

1732 Be has muhuttam, not in Ce or Ee.

1733 Attha garudhamme. The term garudhamma is ambiguous. The word garu normally means "heavy, weighty, grave," as for example in the expression garukā āpatti, a grave or major offense. But garum karoti, lit., "to make weighty," means "to respect," and garukata, "respected." Thus garudhamma can mean either a "heavy, grave rule" or "a rule to be respected, a principle of respect." Mp endorses the second interpretation: "The garudhammas are principles that are to be treated with respect by the bhikkhunis who accept them." The translators of the Vinaya into Chinese also lean toward this interpretation. Thus in the corresponding passage in the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya (at T XXIII 345b29-c33) they are referred to as 八敬法, "eight principles of respect." The Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya (for instance at T XXIV 350c29) calls them 八尊敬法, "eight principles of honor and respect." But the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya (at T XXII 923a27 and elsewhere) designates them 八盡形壽不可
㷌法, "eight principles not to be transgressed throughout life," which corresponds to the Pāli yavajīvaṃ anatikkamanīyo. And the Mahīśasaka Vinaya (at T XXII 185c19) likewise calls them 八不可越法, "eight principles not to be violated."

1734 It is interesting to note how the subject of the discussion shifts almost imperceptibly from the going forth (pabbajjä) of women to their full ordination (upasampadā). The former refers simply to their leaving the household life, the latter to a formal act of admission into the Sangha.

1735 Mahāpajāpatī later asked the Buddha to permit bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs to pay homage to one another (and show. other signs of respect) exclusively on the basis of seniority, without distinction of gender. The Buddha refused and issued a rule: "Bhikkhus should not pay homage to women, stand up for them, salute them reverentially, or behave respectfully toward them. One who does so commits an offense of wrongdoing" (na bhikkhave mātugāmassa ubhivādanam paccutṭhanam añjalikammam sāmicikammam kātabbam; yo kareyya āpatti dukkatassa). The incident is at Vini II 257-58.

1736 This refers to the three months' fixed residence during the rainy season.

1737 Thus on the uposatha day a bhikkhu is assigned the task of giving the bhikkhunīs an exhortation (ovāda). See Thānissaro 2007b: $446-47$.

1738 The "invitation" (paväranā) is a ceremony held on the last day of the rains residence at which all the Sangha members in order of seniority ask the others to point out any fault they may have committed, whether seen, heard about, or suspected. Each bhikkhu extends the invitation to all the other bhikkhus. By this rule, however, bhikkhunis are obliged to invite correction from both the bhikkhus and the other bhikkhunīs. See Thānissaro 2007b: $447-48$.

1739 The penalty period (mānatta) is imposed on a monastic guilty of a sanghädisesa offense. During this period, the offending bhikkhu must undergo penalization for a period of six days; each day he must also inform all his fellow bhikkhus of his transgression, a humiliating experience. In the case of bhikkhunis, however, the penalty period lasts two weeks and must be observed in relation to both bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs. For details, see Thānissaro 2007b: 358-73. In this rule, the word garudhamma has a different meaning from its use in relation to the eight principles as a set. Here, Mp glosses it as garukam sanghādisesāpattim, that is, it is the breach of a sanghädisesa rule. Hūskin (in Mohr and Tsedroen 2010, p. 144) conflates the two senses of the term and thus sees an inconsistency here where there is really none.

1740 A probationer (sikkhamannā) is a woman candidate for full ordination who has already gone forth. To complete the requirements for ordination, she is obliged to live for two years observing a special training in regard to six rules (cha dhammā). The six rules-specified at Vin IV 319,24-29 in connection with Bhikkhuni Pācittiya 63-involve observing without transgression the precepts of abstinence from killing any living being, taking what is not given, sexual activity, false speech, intoxicants, and eating at an improper time (between midday and the following daybreak). Breach of any of these rules presumably requires the candidate to revert to the beginning of her two years' training.

1741 In the Vibhanga section of the Vinaya Pitaka, the rules of the Bhikkhuni Pātimokkha are shown to have been laid down in response to specific incidents of misbehavior on the part of a certain bhikkhuni (or group of bhikkhunis). Several of these rules are already included among the garudhammas. Thus garudhammas -2,-3,-4, and 7 correspond to Bhikkhuni Pācittiyas 56, 59, 57, and 52. Garudhamma 6 has counterparts in Bhikkhuni Pācittiyas 63 and 64. The fact that the background stories to these rules show them originating at different points in the early history of the Bhikkhuni Sangha casts doubt on the historicity of the present account, which shows the eight garudhammas being laid down at the very beginning of the Bhikkhuni Sangha. If the eight garudhammas had been laid down at the birth of the Bhikkhuni Sangha, they would have already been in force and there would have been no need for the Buddha to issue rules to prohibit the same undesirable behavior. He could simply have pointed to the existing rule. The fact that he did issue new rules thus collides with the thesis that the eight garudhammas were laid down at the very start of the Bhikkhuni Sangha.

1742 For atimuttaka, DOP gives "a kind of shrub (perhaps Ougeinia oojeinensis); its flower." Rather than use an obscure Pāli or Latin term, I freely render the name of the flower as "lilies."

1743 Assuming the historical authenticity of this passage, if the Buddha had wished to proscribe the ordination of women, it seems he would likely have pointed out this danger to Ananda at the beginning of their conversation. Ananda would then have desisted from his effort and women would not have received the right to ordain.

1744 Corehi kumbhatthenakehi. Lit, "bandits who commit pot theft." Mp: "They make a lamp with a pot and by means of its light search for valuable goods in others' homes."

1745 Setatṭhika rogajati nipatati. Mp: "A kind of insect pierces the stalk
and enters the middle of the reed. When the stalk is pierced, the sap comes out and cannot reach the top of the paddy plant."

1746 Mañjitthika rogajati nipatati. Mp: "The internal reddening of the sugar cane."

1747 Mp (Ce): "By this he shows the following: 'When a causeway is not built around a large reservoir, whatever water would have remained there if the causeway had first been built does not remain because there is no causeway. So too, these principles of respect have been prescribed in advance, before an incident has arisen, for the purpose of preventing transgression. If they had not been prescribed, then, because women have gone forth, the good Dhamma would have lasted five hundred years. But because they have been lajd down in advance, it will continue another five hundred years and thus last for the thousand years originally stated.' And this expression 'a thousand years' is said with reference to arahants who have attained the analytic knowledges (patisambhidāpabhedappattakhināsavānam vasen'eva vuttam). Following this, for another thousand years, there appear dryinsight arahants; for another thousand years, non-returners; for another thousand years, once-returners; and for another thousand years, stream-enterers. Thus the good Dhamma of penetration (pativedhasaddhammo) will last five thousand years. The Dhamma of learning (pariyattidhammo) will also last this long. For without learning, there is no penetration, and as long as there is learning, there is penetration." From the above, we can see that according to the commentary, the allowance for women to go forth will not shorten the life span of the Dhamma; this is because the Buddha laid down the eight principles of respect, which serve as the dyke or causeway.

1748 This is evidently referring to the third garudhamma. Another anachronism appears here, at least in relation to the commentarial chronology. The Bhikkhuni Sangha, on this chronology, was founded soon after the Buddha's first visit to Kapilavatthu (or, on other chronologies, perhaps five or ten years after the enlightenment), yet it requires the bhikkhu who is to give the exhortation to have twenty years' seniority. This, of course, would not have been possible until at least twenty years after the founding of the Bhikkhu Sangha. By that time, however, Mahāpajāpatī would likely have been too old to make the long journey to Vesāli by foot.

1749 Also at Vin II 258-59. The sutta mirrors 7:83.

1750 Though Ce spells the name "Vyagghapajja," I use this spelling to be consistent with the spelling of the name at 4:194. This must have been his clan name, Dighajānu his personal name.

1751 Ce and Ee udumbarakhādikaṃ va; Be udumbarakhādīvāyaṃ. The intended meaning is obscure. Mp explains: "One wishing to eat figs might shake a ripe fig tree and with one effort knock down many fruits. He would eat the ripe fruits and depart, leaving behind the rest; just so, one who spends the greater part of his earnings enjoys his wealth by dissipating it, so it is said: 'This clansman eats his wealth just like an eater of figs.'" A Chinese parallel, SĀ 91 (T II 23a22-c17), reads at T II 23b17: 人皆名為優婆鉢果，無有種子。思㖕查欲。不顧其後；"Everyone calls him a fig without seeds. The foolish man, a prey to craving, does not consider those who come after."

1752 Ce and Ee ajaddhumārikaṃ; Be ajetthamaraṇam. DOP relates the compound to Skt jagdhvā, "having eaten," and defines ajaddhumärika as "death by starvation." See PED sv jaddhu, said to occur only as negative ajaddhu, "not eating, abstaining from food." Mp (Ce) glosses with anāthamaranam, "death without a protector," Mp (Be) anāyakamaranam, "death without a leader." It seems Mp (Ce) is glossing the reading found in Be. The Chinese at T II 23b19-20 has 傍人皆言是思㖕人如餓死狗，"Other people will all say that foolish man is like a dog starving to death."

1753 Akkhatā saccanämeni. The one "truly named" is the Buddha, since the name "Buddha" corresponds to his real stature as an enlightened one. See too p. 1757, note 1320.

1754 An expanded parallel of 6:23. The additional designations for sensual pleasures are "dart" (salla) and "womb" (gabbha). The verses differ from those at 6:23. The whole sutta, with verses, is cited at Nidd II 62,29-38 (VRI ed. 240).

1755 Ditthadhammikäpi gabbhā na parimuccati, samparāyikāpi gabbhā na parimuccati. Mp: "The womb pertaining to the present life is a human womb; the womb pertaining to future lives is a womb other than the human."

1756 The usual phrase, "for the abandoning of unwholesome qualities and for the acquisition of wholesome qualities," is omitted, perhaps deliberately because this bhikkhu is an arahant.

1757 Text here has arahattaphalasacchikiriyāya patipanno, whereas 8:19 has arahattäya patipanno.

1758 The verses are also at SN 11:16, I 233.

1759 Paññāsitasamāhito. Mp glosses: paññāya ca stlena ca samannāgato. Though this takes samāhito to mean "possessing" rather than attainment of samädhi, by translating it as "composed" we can see how the word indirectly refers to samädhi.

1760 Karotam opadhikaṃ puññam. The word opadhikaṃ means that the merit ripens in upadhi, a future acquisition of the five aggregates,
and that the deed conduces to well-being in the round of rebirths rather than to liberation.

1761 Mp: "For gaining the four requisities," that is, robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines.

1762 Alam attano alam paresam. I add the phrase in brackets on the basis of Mp, which says: "Able [to benefit] himself and able [to benefit] others: capable, fit, equipped in practicing for the welfare of himself and of others" (attano ca paresañca hitapatipattiyam samattho pariyatto anucchaviko).

1763. Khippanisanti ca hoti kusalesu dhammesu. Mp. "He takes up quickly, which means that when such subjects as the aggregates, elements, and sense bases are being taught, he understands them quickly" (khippạ̣ upadhāreti, khandhadhātu-āyatanädīsu kathiyamānesu te dhamme khippam jānāti).

1764 Dhamme ca bhāsite mamaññeva anubandhitabbam maññanti. Mp: "It is said that although an exhortation was given [to him], this bhikkhu remained heedless. Having heard the Dhamma, he just hung around but did not want to strive. Therefore the Blessed One rebuked him. But since the bhikkhu had the supporting conditions for arahantship, the Buddha exhorted him with the words [below], 'Thus should you train yourself."

1765 Mp: "This is the meaning: 'When, bhikkhu, you have developed this fundamental concentration of loving-kindness in such a way, you should not be satisfied merely with this much, but you should attain four and five jhānas [in the fivefold jhāna scheme] in regard to other meditation objects. Thus you should develop it according to the method "with thought and examination" and so forth." While, in the jhāna scheme of the Nikāyas, the transition from the first to the second jhāna is marked by the simultaneous elimination of thought (vitakka) and examination (vicāra), other texts distīnguish samädhi as threefold: as with thought and examination, without thought but with examination, and without thought and examination (see DN 33.1.10, III 219,19-20; MN 128.31, III 162,13-16; SN 43:3, IV 360,11-13). This middle stage of samädhi gave rise, in the Abhidhamma, to a fivefold scheme of jhānas that inserts, after the first jhāna, a second jhāna that is without thought but with examination. This scheme then renumbers the second, third, and fourth jhānas of the fourfold scheme as"the third, fourth, and fifth jhānas to obtain a fivefold scheme. The samädhi with rapture (sappitika) includes the first and second jhānas (of the fourfold scheme); that without rapture (nippītika) includes the third and fourth jhānas. The samädhi with comfort (sätasahagata) is the third jhāna, and the samädhi with equanimity (upekkhāsahagata) the fourth jhāna.

1766 I read with Ee bahulikato, as against Ce and Be subhāvito.

1767 This sentence is not in Ce, apparently omitted by oversight.

1768 Obhāsaññeva kho sañjänämi, no ca rūpāni passāmi. Mp glosses obhäsam as the "light of the knowledge of the divine eye" (dibbacakkhuñānobhāsaṃ).

1769 Mp: "Here, knowledge and vision (ñānadassana) is the divine eye (dibbacakkhubhütam)."

1770 Mp associates these eight facets respectively with the following eight kinds of higher knowledge: (1) the knowledge of the divine eye, (2) the knowledge of spiritual potency, (3) the knowledge encompassing the minds of others, (4) the knowledge of how beings fare in accordance with their kamma, (5) the knowledge of the future, (6) the knowledge of the present, (7) the knowledge of the past, and (8) the knowledge of past lives. Mp continues: "These are the eight knowledges that have come down in the text. But this sutta should be explained by conjoining these with the insight knowledges, the four path knowledges, the four fruition knowledges, the four reviewing knowledges, the four analytical knowledges, and the six knowledges unique to a Buddha."

1771 Abhibhāyatanāni. From the descriptions both in the text and commentary, it seems that the "bases of overcoming" are actually approaches to the kasinas, described in detail in Vism, chaps. 4 and 5. Mp: "The abhibhāyatanāni are causes of overcoming (abhibhavanakäranāni). What do they overcome? The adverse qualities and the objects. For they overcome the adverse qualities opposed to them (patipakkhabhāvena paccantkadhammé) and, through a person's superior knowledge, [they overcome] the objects (puggalassa ñāṇuttariyatāya ārammanāni)."

1772 Mp: "Percipient of forms internally (ajjhattaṃ rūpasaññ̃): This refers to the internal form used for the preliminary work. For someone does the preliminary work [of meditation] on a blue form, such as the head hairs, the bile, or the irises. Doing the preliminary work on a yellow form, he uses bodily fat, the skin, or the surfaces of the hands and feet, or a yellow area in the eyes. Doing the preliminary work on a red form, he uses flesh, blood, the tongue, or a red area in the eyes. Doing the preliminary work on a white form, he uses bones, teeth, nails, or the whites of the eyes. These are not perfectly blue, yellow, red, or white, but impure. [He] sees forms externally (eko bahiddhā rūpāni passati): When the preliminary work has thus occurred internally, but the mark appears externally, he is said to be 'one percipient of forms internally [who] sees forms externally,' that is; his preliminary work is done internally but absorption (jhāna) occurs externally. Having overcome them (tāni abhibhuyya): As a person with good digestion
who has obtained a mere spoonful of food collects it together, thinking, 'What is there to eat here?' and uses limited ability, so a person whose knowledge is emerging, one of clear knowledge, thinks: 'What is there to attain in regard to a limited object? This isn't troublesome for me.' Having overcome those forms, he enters an attainment, and with the arising of the mark he reaches absorption. He is percipient thus (evamsaññī hoti): He is percipient with the perception of reflective attention (äbhoga) and with the perception of the jhāna. 'I know, I see' (jänämi passämi): By this, his reflective attention is spoken of; for that occurs after he has emerged from the attainment, not in the attainment itself. The perception of overcoming (abhibhavanasañña) exists in the attainment, but the perception of reflective attention (äbhogasañña) occurs after he has emerged from the attainment."

1773 Mp: "As a hungry person who has obtained ample food does not see that meal as large but thinks: 'Give me seconds and thirds. What will this do for me?' so a person whose knowledge is emerging, one of clear knowledge, thinks: 'What is there to attain here? This isn't a measureless object. It isn't troublesome for me to obtain one-pointedness of mind.' Having overcome [those forms], he enters an attainment, and with the arising of the mark he reaches absorption."

1774 Mp: "One not percipient of forms internally sees forms externally (ajjhattam arūpasaññī eko bahiddhā rūpāni passati): This describes one for whom the preliminary work and the mark have arisen externally. Thus both by way of the preliminary work and by way of absorption, he is called one who is not percipient of forms internally [but] sees forms externally."

1775 Mp: "From the fifth base of overcoming on, he shows their thorough purification. For these bases are stated by way of purified colors (visuddhavamnavasèn'eva)." The colored bases of overcoming are illustrated by similes below at 10:29, as well as at DN 16.3.29-32, II 110-11.

1776 The word vimokkha is used here in a specific and limited sense and does not imply irreversible liberation of the mind from all defilements; this latter is usually indicated by akuppā cetovimutti or cetovimutti paññãvimutti. Mp: "In what sense are they emancipations? In the sense of releasing (adhimuccanatthena). In what sense releasing? In the sense of thoroughly freeing from adverse qualities, and in the sense of thoroughly freeing through delight in the object. What is meant is [the mind's] occurrence on the object without constraint, free from worry, like a child sleeping on his father's lap, his body completely relaxed. This second meaning [regarding the object] does not apply to the last
emancipation, but only to the others [for in the last emancipation there is no object of perception]."

1777 Rūpī rūpāni passati. Mp: "Here, 'form' is the jhāna with a form object, which has arisen by way of a blue kasina, etc., based on something internal such as head hairs, etc. One who gains this [jhāna] is said to possess form. One might also see forms with the eye of jhāna externally, such as a blue kasina, etc. What is indicated by this are the four form-sphere jhānas in the case of a person who has attained jhāna through the kasinas with an internal or external basis."

1778. One not percipient of forms internally sees forms externally (ajjhattam arūpasaññī, bahiddhā rūpāni passati). Mp: "One who is not percipient of forms internally is one who does not attain form-sphere jhānas based on his own head hairs, etc. What is shown by this are the form-sphere jhānas of one who attains jhāna externally, having done the preliminary work externally."

1779 Subhant'eva adhimutto hoti. Mp: "By this what is shown are jhānas based on extremely purified color kasinas, such as blue, etc." Mp points out that Patis, a canonical exegetical treatise, defines the emancipation on the beautiful as the four immeasurable states (loving-kindness, compassion, altruistic joy, and equanimity); see Patis II 39,14-26. It seems that the first emancipation comprises the first two bases of overcoming; the second, the second two bases of overcoming; and the third, the remaining four bases of overcoming.

1780 On the cessation of perception and feeling (saññāvedayitanirodha), see MN 43.25, I 296,5-23; MN 44.16-21, 301,30-302,27; SN 41.6, IV 293-95; Vism 702-9, Ppn 23.16-52.

1781 Obtained by combining the four of 4:250 and the four of 4:252.

1782 Obtained by combining the four of $4: 251$ and the four of 4:253.

1783 Also at DN 16.3.21-23, II 109-10.

1784 This passage, which shows the Buddha as a master of bodily transformations, seems to have proto-Mahāyānistic features. Mp comments: "Whether the others are white, black, or brown, the Teacher is golden-colored. But this is stated with reference to shape. And the shape alone is perceived by them. It is not the case that the Blessed One becomes like a foreigner or like one wearing pearl earrings; he sits there in the form of a Buddha. But they see him as having the same shape as themselves. Some speak with a broken voice, some with a cackling voice, some with the voice of a crow, but the Teacher always has the voice of Brahmā. This is stated with reference to the language. For if the Teacher is sitting in a king's seat, they think, 'The king speaks sweetly today.' When the Blessed One departs after speaking, and they
see the [real] king arrive, they wonder: 'Who was that?'... Even though they investigate, they do not know. Then why does the Buddha teach the Dhamma to them if they do not know? To plant impressions (vāsanatthāya). For when the Dhamma is heard even in such a way, it becomes a condition for the future. Thus he teaches out of consideration for the future."

1785 The portion of this sutta as far as the verse is also at SN 51:10, V 258-63. The entire sutta is at DN 16.3.1-20, II 102-9.

1786 Kappan vā tiṭ̣heyya kappā̄sasesaṃ vā. Mp glosses kappa, "eon," as. āyukappa, "the life eon," the full normal life span of human beings at a particular time, presently a hundred years. Kappā̄vasesa, "the remainder of the eon," is explained as a little more than the normal life span of a hundred years. Mp mentions the view of an elder named Mahāsīva, who held that the Buddha could live on for the rest of the cosmic eon, but Mp cites the old commentary as holding that the "life eon" alone is intended (idameva atthakathāya niyämitam). Nevertheless, nowhere else in the Nikāyas is kappa used in the sense of a normal human life span, and there seems no compelling reason to ascribe to the word as used here a meaning different from the usual one, that is, a cosmic eon.

1787 Yathā tam Mārena pariyutthitacitto. Mp: "As any worldling would not be able to pick up a hint, so Ānanda was unable to pick it up. For Māra can obsess the mind of anyone who has not entirely abandoned the twelve cognitive inversions (vipallasa; see 4:49), and'Ānanda [being only a stream-enterer] still had four of them. [Mp-t: The inversions of perception and thought that take the unattractive as attractive and the painful as pleasurable.] Māra obsessed his mind by displaying a frightful sight. On seeing this, the elder failed to pick up the clear hint given him by the Buddha."

1788 Interestingly, in the Nikāyas no such conversation between the Buddha and Māra is recorded as having taken place earlier in the Buddha's life. It is referred to only in this sutta and its parallels at DN 16.3.7-8, II 104-6, and SN 51:10, V 260,29-262,11.

1789 The expression pattayogakkhemā, "attained to security from bondage," is in all three editions of AN but is absent from some (but not all) editions of the text's parallels in DN and SN mentioned in the preceding note. Since the phrase normally denotes the attainment of arahantship, it seems out of place in a description of the lay disciples. Mp comments on all the other expressions here but this, which suggests it was not present in the version available to the commentator.

Mp glosses sappātihäriyam dhammam desenti with "they teach the Dhamma so that it is emancipating" (yāva niyyānikaṃ
katvä dhammam desessanti). Mp-t elaborates: "They explain the Dhamma in such a way that the doctrines of others are demolished and their own doctrine is established; thus, by citing reasons, it brings attainment of the goal [to be] achieved" (yathā paravädam bhañjitvä sakavädo patitthahati, evam hetūdāharaṇehi yathädhigatamattham sampādetvä dhammam kathessanti). My reason for translating sappatthäriya as "antidotal" is explained on p. 1673, note 586.

1790 Ayusanikhāram ossaji. Mp: "Having thoroughly set up mindfulness, having limited it by knowledge, he discarded, abandoned, his vital force. The Blessed One did not relinquish his vital force in the way one drops a clod of earth with one's hand, but he resolved, 'I will enter fruition attainment for only three more months but not beyond that.'"

1791 The verse is difficult, especially the first couplet. It is commented on identically by Spk III 254-55, Sv II 557-58, Mp IV 153-54, and Ud-a 329-30. The commentaries offer two interpretations, one taking tulam and atulam as opposites, the other taking tulam as the short present participle (= tulento) and atulam and sambhavam as the opposites. I adopt the second interpretation. For a fuller discussion of the verse, see CDB 1941-44, note 255.

1792 Ce and Ee have kampeti, sañkampeti, sampakampeti. Be adds a fourth verb, sampavedheti, which might be rendered "makes [it] shudder." Just below, non-causative counterparts of the three verbs occur in Ce and Ee: kampati, sankampati, sampakampati. Be has a fourth, sampavedhati.

1793 An expanded parallel of 6:19. The additional sections are on living for half a day and for the time needed to eat half a meal.

1794 An expanded parallel of 6:20.

1795 The eight accomplishments (sampadā) and their definitions are as in 8:54, but without the section on the four dissipations of wealth.

1796 An expanded parallel of 6:31 and partly of 5:90 and 7:26.

1797 An expanded parallel of 5:24, 6:50, and 7:65.

1798 Tathägatam dhammadesanā patibhāti. Here I render this peculiar Pāli idiom in accordance with the context as "is disposed to teach." Literally, it would be rendered "a Dhamma teaching shines upon [or 'occurs to'] the Tathāgata."

1799 Ekantapatibhänā tathāgataṃ dhammadesanā hoti.

1800 A distinction between sambhava (in question 2) and samudaya (in question 3) is hard to pinpoint, since in the suttas the two words are often used almost synonymously. Mp derives samudaya from the verb form samudenti and glosses this with rāst bhavanti, "to accumulate, to become a heap."

1801 Brahmāli (in a private communication) offers a fine explanation of this cryptic sulta: "I understand sabbe dhamma to be a reference to the world of personal experience. The meaning would then be as follows: All elements of our experience are rooted in desire (chandamülak $\bar{a}$ ) in the sense that we exist due to desire (taking chanda as equivalent to craving). They come into being through attention (manasikārasambhavā) in the sense that we only experience what we attend to. They originate from contact (phassasamudaya) because without contact we don't experience anything at all. They converge upon feeling (vedanāsamosarana) in the sense that feeling is the most important aspect of our experience, the basic motivating factor in everything we do. They are headed by concentration (samädhippamukhā) in the sense that concentration is a controlling faculty (an indriya) whose lead all elements of our experience must follow. They are under the authority of mindfulness (satädhipateyyā) because mindfulness is another controlling faculty which directs us in whatever we do or experience. All things have wisdom as supervisor (paññuttarā) because wisdom is the chief of the controlling faculties; wisdom, more than anything else, controls our experience (the last three factors are what allow us to get a sense of being in charge of our lives). That liberation is their core (vimuttisärā), the most excellent of all things, is self-explanatory."

1802 Mp clarifies some of these points. (1) An unskilled thief attacks those who should not be attacked, such as old people, children, and virtuous people who are not his enemies and who don't attack him. (2) A skillful thief should take only half of what is available; for example, if there are two articles of clothing he should take only one; of portions of food, he should take one for himself and leave the other (he can take the superior item for himself). (7) An unskilled thief commits theft in a nearby village, town, or city. (8) An unskilled thief does not purify the path to the other world by "depositing" a portion of his spoils in gifts to those "worthy of offerings" (yam laddham, tam dakkhiṇeyye nidahitum cheko na hoti, paralokamaggaṃ na sodheti). Presumably a skillful thief will "deposit" part of his plunder by offering it to worthy monks and thereby "purify the path to the other world."

1803 I follow Ce here. Be and Ee put vedag $\bar{u}$ before bhisakko.

1804 The verse as preserved seems incomplete because the relative clauses beginning with yam are not explicitly completed by a demonstrative clause. I thus follow Vanarata's suggestion that an implicit demonstrative corresponding to anuttaram pattabbami should be read into the concluding verse. It seems that
vijitasañgamo refers precisely to this, and I have thus added "over that" in brackets.

1805 Ce paramo danto; Be paramadanto; Ee paramam danto. The gloss in Mp, paramadamathena dantattā paramadanto nāma, suggests that parama qualifies danto, not nāgo as in Ce.

1806 The opening framework of this sutta is the same as that of 5:30 and 6:42 but the content of the discourse partly differs.

1807 In what follows, factors $\S \S 4-7$ are identical with $\S \S 1-4$ of 6:42. In Ce and Ee, $\S \S 5-6$ of 6:42 are excluded from this sutta, but the last sentence of 6:42, not a numerical factor there, here becomes

$\S 8$. Be includes $\S \S 5-6$ of 6:42, which then become $\S \S 8-9$. The final sentence of the sutta would then either be unnumbered or counted as $\S 10$. If Be is followed, it is hard to account for this sutta being in the Eights rather than in the Nines or Tens. $\S \S 1-3$ of the present sutta have no counterparts in the previous versions. Brahmāli suggests numbering the sentence that begins "Even some deities" as $\S 1$ and treating the final sentence of the sutta as unnumbered, which would be consistent with 6:42. However, I here follow the numbering of Ce , my primary source text.

1808 The Ce reading here agrees more closely with the Be reading of 6:42 than with the Ce reading of the latter. But here Ce has the verb paccessati, "to return" (absent in Ce 6:42), whereas in both suttas Be has upatthahissati, "will serve." Ee's saccessati is likely to be a misreading of paccessati. This version has no mention of sahadhammika, a co-religionist, as in 6:42.

1809 Pattam nikkujjeyya. The procedures of overturning the almsbowl and turning it upright are authorized at Vin II 124-27. See Thānissaro 2007b: 411-12. Mp: "May overturn the almsbowl on him: They do not actually turn the almsbowl upside down in front of him, but they enact the motion of 'overturning the almsbowl,' which means that they do not accept gifts from this person. Similarly, they might decide to abolish this act by enacting a motion to turn the bowl upright (ukkujjeyya), which entitles them to receive his gifts again." This procedure was used in Burma during the tumultuous period of late 2007 when the monks decided that the behavior of the military junta toward the Sangha merited such a penalty. The monks walked down the streets with their bowls actually turned upside down to express disapproval of the rulers' actions.

1810 Appasäda. Mp: "When this has been proclaimed, they need not rise up from their seat for him, or pay homage to him, or go out to meet him, or give him gifts."

1811 Mp mentions the "five unsuitable resorts," probably a reference to those at 5:102.

1812 Patisāraniyakamma. When this is imposed, the bhikkhu must go to the householder, accompanied by another bhikkhu, and apologize to him. If he fails to win the householder's forgiveness, his companion should try to reconcile them. The background story is at Vin II 15-18, with the legal stipulations at Vin II 18-21. For details, see Thānissaro 2007b: 407-11.

1813 Tassapāpiyasikakamma. The grounds for this penalty are discussed at Vin II 85-86. See, too, Thānissaro 2007a: 549-51, where it is rendered "further-punishment transaction." According to the origin story, this penalty is imposed on a bhikkhu who speaks evasively or reacts aggressively when charged with a grave offense (an offense of the sanghādisesa class) and then admits to it only under pressure.

1814 See pp. 1732-33, note 1085.

1815 Na ca tena mūlena vutthāpetabbo. Mp says: "He does not get to do an act of rehabilitation [in a case] that takes that root" (tam mūlam katvā abbhānakammam kātum na labhati). The exact meaning is unclear. I follow Brahmāli's suggestion that mūla here is "the root offense," that is, the original offense that led to the formal charge of aggravated misconduct.

1816 Ee does not number this chapter or the suttas it contains. Ce and Be number it X (or 10), continuing the consecutive numbering scheme used for the earlier vaggas in this nipāta. Ce numbers the suttas 1-27, Be 91-116. The difference in number stems from the addition of one laywoman mentioned in Ce and Ee (which I follow) but missing in Be.

1817 The editions differ in the extent to which they attach epithets to the personal names of the women. Ce has the greatest number; some may be late additions. Ee attaches upāsikā only to Khujjuttarā, Sāmāvatī, and Suppiyā; Be attaches it to these three and to Bojjhā. The designations rājakumārī (princess) and devī (queen) are found only in Ce. I have been irregular in my treatment of the word māt $\bar{a}$ pertaining to a woman's identity. When it follows another name occurring in the genitive, I translate it "mother." When it is the last part of a compound, as in Mīgāramātā, I leave it untranslated, assuming it was probably part of the woman's actual name-in-use and not merely a way of indicating her identity. Mp says that all these suttas should be elaborated by way of the undertaking of the uposatha observance complete with the eight factors. Thus presumably they should all be modeled on 8:42. At 8:43 and 8:45 we already find this for Visākhā and Bojjhā respectively.

1818 This name is omitted in Be, which accordingly has only twentysix suttas in this chapter.

1819 She is probably identical with Velukanṭakī Nandamatā. See p. 1610 , note 141.

1820 Ee does not number this vagga. Ce and Be number it XI (or 11), continuing their consecutive numbering schemes. As with the Book of Sevens, I have numbered it as if it were a sixth chapter in this set of fifty. Ce numbers the suttas in the series from $1-510$. Be numbers the suttas in continuation with those in the entire nipāta, from 117 to 626 . I follow the sutta numbering of Be , though my count starts and ends one number higher because of the additional female lay follower in the previous vagga (absent in Be).

# NOTES TO THE NINES

1821 This is a composite nine, obtained by combining the five proximate causes and the four meditation subjects.

1822 The concept " 1 am" (asmimana) is more subtle than personalexistence view (sakkāyaditthi). Both are removed by the perception of non-self, but whereas the stream-enterer eliminates personalexistence view, only the arahant eliminates the conceit "I am." On this point see SN 22:89, III 130,8-131,31. It seems that personalexistence view has a stronger conceptual underpinning than the conceit "I am," which is more closely connected to existential need and therefore can be eliminated only at arahantship.

1823 Mp: "When the characteristic of impermanence is seen, the characteristic of non-self is seen. Among the three characteristics, when one is seen, the other two are also seen. Thus it is said: 'When one perceives impermanence, the perception of non-self is stabilized.'" Mp-t, commenting on 9:3, says: "One who perceives impermanence (aniccasaññino): one who perceives impermanence by way of the contemplation of impermanence, which occurs thus: 'All conditioned phenomena are impermanent' because they cease to be after having existed; because they arise and vanish; because they are fragile; because they are temporary; and because they exclude permanence. The perception of non-self is stabilized (anattasaññā sanṭhāti): the perception of non-self consists in the contemplation of non-self, which occurs thus: 'All phenomena are non-self' because they are coreless; because we have no mastery over them; and because they are alien, void, hollow, and empty. This perception is stabilized, firmly established in the mind."

1824 This is another composite nine, arrived at by combining the five means of support with the four reliances.

1825 Nissayasampanno. The expression occurs at 3:20, but with a different nuance. Mp glosses nissayasampanno here with
patitthāsampanno, "possessed of a foundation," which suggests it refers to the supporting conditions for attaining arahantship.

1826 These are the five trainee's powers (sekhabalāni) of 5:1-2.

1827 Tami hi'ssa bhikkhuno akusalam pahīnam hoti suppahīnam, yamsa ariyāya paññāya disvā pahinam. This statement indicates that whereas the previous four abandonings are tentative and reversible, the abandoning effected by wisdom is permanent and irreversible.

1828 These four are found among the six methods of abandoning the àsavas explained at 6:58. See, too, MN 2, where they are included among the seven methods of abandoning the asavas.

1829 Still another composite nine, arrived at by combining the five things that lead to the mind's maturation and the four meditation subjects, with the addition of a narrative framework. The sutta is also found as Ud 4:1, 34-37, with an "inspired utterance" added.

1830 Mp says that Calika was the name of a city and nearby was a mountain also called Calika. They had built a large monastery there and the Blessed One had been dwelling in the monastery, supported by the city.

1831 Reading with Ce and Be agacchati, as against Ee dissatu, "let be seen."

1832 Actually, what occurs."a second time" is only the request for permission, not the full statement. Mp: "There is nothing further to be done (natthi kiñci uttarim karanīyam): because the four functions have been done respecting the four truths. And no [need] to increase what has been done (katassa vā paticayo): no repetition of what he has attained. For the path already developed is not developed again, and there is no repeated abandoning of abandoned defilements."

1833 Mp: "In five hundred successive lives he had been a king. There had been a stone slab there where he used to sit. He had come accompanied by three troops of dancing girls to amuse himself in the park. From the time Meghiya sat down there, it seemed as if he were no longer a monk but a king sitting on a regal couch beneath a white parasol, surrounded by his retinue of dancing girls. As he enjoyed his splendor, sensual thoughts arose in him. Just then, he seemed to see two thieves who had been arrested by his men and brought before him. In ordering one to be executed, thoughts of ill will arose in him; and in ordering the other to be imprisoned, thoughts of harming arose. Thus he was enveloped by those unwholesome thoughts like a tree by creepers, or like a honey-eater by honey bees."

1834 Mp: "Liberation of mind (cetovimutti): liberation of mind from defilements. In the preliminary phase of practice, the mind is liberated from defilements by way of [liberation in] a particular
respect (tadangavasena) and by way of suppression (vikkhambhanavasena). In the subsequent phase, it is liberated by way of eradication (samucchedavasena) and by way of tranquilization (patipassaddhivasena). When the dispositions have been awakened and matured, insight gives rise to the path, and as insight reaches maturity, liberation of mind is said to have matured. But in their absence it has not yet matured."

1835 This is still another composite nine, obtained by joining the four attributes described by the Buddha with the five benefits in timely listening to the Dhamma.

1836 This begins like 8:71 but develops differently.

1837 Be has cetosamädhissa throughout, as against Ce and Ee cetosamathassa.

1838 Adhipaññädhammāvipassanā, glossed as "the insight knowledge that comprehends conditioned phenomena" (sañkhārapariggāhakavipassanā̄̄̄̄a).

1839 I read here with Ee: tathā tathā'ssa satthā piyo ca hoti manāpo ca garu ca bhāvanīya ca. Ce and Be have tathā tathā so satihu ...garu ca bhāvanīyo ca, which means that the bhikkhu becomes respected and esteemed by the Buddha.

1840 Tathā tathā so tasmiṃ dhamme atthapatisamvedī ca hoti dhammapatisamvedī ca; as at 5:26, III 21-23. See p. 1724, note 990. Strangely, though the theme of this passage is the benefit in listening to and discussing the Dhamma, the second, third, and fourth benefits (and perhaps the first as well) accrue to the monk who is teaching. the Dhamma.

1841 Tatha tatha so tasmiṃ dhamme gambhīraṃ atthapadaṃ paññāya ativijjha passati. See p: 1761, note 1346.

1842 This is still another composite nine, which combines the four powers with the transcending of five fears.

1843 The explanation of "impartiality" given here may be puzzling. Samānattatā is a compound of "equal" (samāna) and "oneself" (attan). As applied to conduct, it means treating others as one would have them treat oneself, without bias or partiality. Here the word is being used to express the equality between those at the four levels of awakening, all with himself or herself.

1844 Although the text puts the subject in the singular, I have used the plural, which sounds more natural in English. The text uses the same future participle, sevitabbam (and its negation, asevitabbam), in relation to each subject, but I render it differently as best fits each particular case. The verb sevati, on which the participle is based, has a wide range of meanings and can support all these renderings.

1845 Rattibhāgaṃ vā divasabhāgaṃ vā. Mp: "Having known [this] some
time at night, one should leave that very night. But if at night there is danger of attack by wild beasts, etc., one may wait until dawn. Having known [this] some time during the day, one should leave that very day. But if there is danger during the day, one may wait until sunset."

1846 I prefer Ee, which does not include san்kha pi, "having reflected," in the first alternative. Ce and Be both include san்kha pi in the first three sections. It seems, however, that reflection only becomes pertinent when there is tension between advantages and disadvantages; as in the second and third alternatives. Since the first alternative poses both material and spiritual disadvantages to staying, the proper choice is immediately evident and does not require reflection. MN 17, I 104-8, which is partly parallel to this sutta, provides a check on the readings. MN 17.3 (in Ce, Be, and Ee readings; Ee at I 105,8-10) supports the absence of san்kha pi in Ee text of AN.

1847 I read here with Ee apuccha, as against Ce and Be anapuccha. MN 17.4, in Ce and Be, have apuccha, while Ee has neither (at I 105,2829). It would be proper for the bhikkhu to take leave of the person on whom he has been relying-his preceptor or teacher-since the person has at least been kind enough to provide for his material needs. Further, the omission here of the words rattibhagam va divasabhagam va, "any time night or day," suggests there must also be a difference in the manner of departing.

1848 Giribbaja, a name for Rajagaha, because of the surrounding mountains.

1849 Abhabbo khīnāsavo bhikkhu sikkham puccakkhātum. This means, in effect, that he is incapable of giving up the monastic training and returning to lay life. I am following the reading of Ce. Be and Ee have the last four items of 9:8 here, and their version of the latter has the last four items of the present sutta. Hence in Ee, page 371 falls in 9:8 of the Ce version, following "a wrong course on account of fear."

1850 Gotrabhū. In his translation of Vism, where the word is used in a technical sense, Nānamoli renders it "change-of-lineage" (see Vism 672-75, Ppn 22.1-14). Mp explains this person-in accordance with the exegetical scheme of the commentariesas "one with a mind of powerful insight that has reached the peak, the immediate condition for the path of stream-entry." Mp is here referring to the gotrabh $\bar{u}$ mind-moment in the cognitive process (cittavithi) of the path, the mental event that immediately precedes sotapattimaggacitta, the mind-moment of the path of stream-entry. Since this scheme is relatively late and presupposes the Abhidhamma theory of the cognitive process, it is unlikely
to reveal the original meaning of gotrabh $\bar{u}$. In the Nikāyas, the word occurs infrequently. In the present sutta it seems to mean simply a virtuous monk or nun who has not reached the path of stream-entry. We find the plural form at MN 142.8, III 255,6-7: "But in the future, Ānanda, there will be clan members, with ochre [robes around] their necks, immoral people, of bad character" (bhavissanti kho pan'ānanda, anāgatamaddhānaṃ gotrabhuno $k \bar{a} s \bar{a} v a k a n t h a ̄$ dusstlā pāpadhammā). In the latter passage it has a pejorative sense, referring to those who show merely the outer marks of a monastic without worthy inner qualities.

1851 Mp glosses āsajja with ghattetvā, implying physical violence, and appatinissajja with akkhamāpetvā, "without asking pardon." Mp continues: "Why did he bear resentment [against Sāriputta]? It is said that after the elder had paid homage to the Buddha, the edge of his robe hit the monk's body as he was walking away.... Because of this the monk became resentful, so when he saw the elder leaving with a large retinue, out of envy he thought to obstruct his journey; thus he spoke as he did."

1852 Mp explains that if the Buddha had tried to exonerate Sāriputta, the bhikkhu would have thought that the Teacher was taking the side of his chief disciple and not the side of a junior monk; thus he would have harbored hatred against the Buddha, too. By calling Säriputta and asking him about the matter, the Buddha will get Sāriputta to exonerate himself.

1853 Khamāmahaṃ bhante tassa āyasmato sace maṃ so āyasmā evam āha "khamatu ca me so āyasmā" ti. As I understand this sentence, Sāriputta is simply saying that he will pardon the accusing bhikkhu if the latter asks him for pardon. Mp, however, explains this sentence otherwise: "The elder [Sāriputta], having pardoned the monk for his transgression, apologizes to him before the Buddha." This explanation, it seems, has influenced the translation in Gradual Sayings: "Lord, I do pardon that venerable one, if he speak thus to me; and let him, too, pardon me" (4:252). It is also reflected in NDB 233: "I shall forgive him, Lord, if this revered monk asks for my pardon. And he, too, may forgive me." The text itself, however, says nothing about Säriputta offering an apology to his accuser, since he has done nothing that calls for an apology. Sāriputta is not himself addressing these words to the monk; he is saying that the monk should address these words to him in order to obtain pardon. In other words, so far the monk has apologized only to the Buddha, not to Sāriputta. On principle, Sāriputta can only pardon the monk if the latter asks for pardon. The word $c a$, "and," occurs in the sentence to be spoken
by the monk, presumably, to mean "in addition to the Buddha, let Sāriputta also pardon me."

1854 As at 7:42.

1855 I read (twice) with Ce and Be ke ca, as against Ee keci.

1856 The contrast is between sa-upädisesam and anupädisesam. Mp glosses these respectively as sa-upädänasesam," with a residue of clinging," and upädänasesarahitam, "devoid of a residue of clinging." See 7:56, which also speaks about those with a residue remaining and those without residue remaining.

1857 Wherever Ce and Be read mattasokāri,"cultivates to a moderate extent," Ee has na paripürakäri, "does not fulfill."

1858 Dhammapariyāyo pañhädhippāyena bhāsito. Mp: "He shows: 'It was spoken because of the question you asked.' But to dispel the desire and lust for further existence among these nine types of persons, he spoke the sutta: 'Bhikkhus, just as even a trifling amount of feces is foul smelling, so too I do not praise even a trifling amount of existence, even for a mere finger snap' (1:328). Not only is the destiny of these nine persons fixed (gati nibaddhā), but the destiny is fixed for those families who have such fixed merit as [taking] the three refuges and the five precepts, [giving] one ticket meal, one fortnight meal, one dwelling for the rains residence, one pond, one dwelling. Those families are similar to stream-enterers."

1859 Mp glosses samparāyavedanīyam as "kamma ripening in the next existence" (dutiye attabhāve vipaccanakakammam).

1860 I translate following Be and Ee, which read dukkhavedaniyam. Ce has sukhavedaniyam, presumably because of the difficulty in seeing why the practitioner would want his kamma to be felt as painful.

1861 Mp glosses paripakkavedanīyam as laddhavipākavāram, "[kamma] that has gained the chance to yield results." Its opposite, aparipakkavedanīyam, is aladdhavipākavāram, "[kamma] that has not gained the chance to yield results."

1862 Mp-t: "Kamma to be experienced is [kamma] that has not yet started to ripen but which is capable of producing results when there is an assemblage of other conditions. Kamma not to be expcrienced is classified as ahosikamma, etc., which is incapable of ripening because of a deficiency of conditions" (vedanīyan ti paccayantarasamavāye vipākuppädanasamattham, na āraddhavipākam eva; avedanīyan ti paccayavekallena vipaccitum asamattham ahosikammādibhedam). The concept of ahosikamma, kamma that never obtains a chance to ripen, is derived from Patis II 78,2-10 (Be 5234). See too CMA 205.

1863 Mahakotthita asks Sāriputta a total of ten questions and receives ten replies. It thus seems peculiar that this sutta is included among the Nines, yet there is no other indication of a numerical framework than the number of questions asked and answered.

1864 According to Mp, Samiddhi was Sāriputta's pupil. See 8:83, where the Buddha asks and answers a similar series of questions.

1865 Mp: "Intentions and thoughts are thoughts that are intentions" (sankappavitakkā ti sankappabhūtā vitakkā). This is said because the two words, sankappa and vitakka, are.used almost interchangeably in the texts.

1866 Nāmarūpārammanā. Mp glosses: "With name and form as condition (nāmarūpapaccayā). By this he shows that the four formless aggregates and the form dependent on the primary elements are the condition for thoughts."

1867 The sections of the sutta up to this point encompass all experience. $\S \S 5-7$ refer to factors of the path; $\S 8$, to the fruit; and $\S 9$, to the ultimate goal.

1868 Mp: "When they have attained the fruit of liberation, they have attained the core" (phalavimuttin patvä sārappattā honii).

1869 Amatogadha. Mp explains this with reference to the idea that the path and fruit take nibbāna as object: "Having gotten a foothold in the deathless nibbāna by [making it] an object, they are established there" (ārammanavasena amatam nibbānam ogāhituā tattha patitthitā).

1870 Abhedanamukhāni. Lit., "orifices without breaks." Mp: "They are wound-orifices not made by anyone but originated solely by kamma." The nine are the two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, the mouth, the urinary passage, and the rectum.

1871 An expanded parallel based on 7:48 and more remotely on 5:61.

1872 An expanded parallel of 7:13.

1873 Mp: "They do not rise up from their seats and come forth to greet one, as a way of humbling themselves and nurturing the mind."

1874 Mp: "They do not pay homage with the five placements" (that is, with the head, feet, and hands placed on the ground).

1875 An expanded parallel of 8:41, the eight precepts augmented by the meditation on loving-kindness.

1876. Mp: "The Blessed One does not ask this with reference to alms given to the Sangha of bhikkhus. For in Anāthapindika's home excellent almsfood was constantly given to the bhikkhus. But the alms being given to the multitude was coarse, which did not please Anāthapindika. So the Buddha asks with that intention." Mp's explanation sounds contrived, for the expressions
the Buddha uses in his response suggest that alms to renunciants were intended. It is possible this sutta was spoken at a time when Anāthapindika's finances were low. Alternatively, given its legendary character, the sutta may be in part a literary fiction composed for a didactic purpose. A Chinese parallel, MA 155, has virtually the same exchange as the Pāli at T I 677a12-13. In another Chinese parallel, EĀ 27.3, Anāthapindika says (at T II 644b22): "My poor family always practices giving, but the food is coarse and we don't always give the same" (䉆案恒行布施。又敳食鹿䝑。不與常同).

1877 These are the five ways a bad person gives a gift, as stated at 5:147. Just below the text will mention the five ways a good person gives a gift, also at 5:147.

1878 Presumably it is the nine types of gifts that justify including this sutta in the Nines. There seems to be no other ninefold scheme to explain its place in this nipāta.

1879 Ce sandassanāni; Be sandhanāni; Ee santhanāni. Mp does not provide a gloss and PED does not offer a useful definition under any of those readings. But in PED sandāna is defined as "cord, tether, fetter."

1880 Mp glosses kaṃsūpadhāraṇāni as rajatamayakhirapaṭicchakāni, "silver receptacles for the milk." I am not aware that kaṃsa can mean silver. DOP sv kaṃsa says that kaṃsūpadhārana can mean "yielding a pailful of milk, or with a metal milking-pail." Mp adds that the horns of the milk cows were covered with sheaths of gold; people tied garlands of jasmine around their necks, attached ornaments to their four feet, spread an excellent jute cloth over their backs, and tied a golden bell around their necks. Such ways of adorning cattle, though less costly, are still practiced in India today.

1881 Mp says that conventionally one koti is twenty pairs of cloth, but here ten garments is meant.

1882 Annassa pānassa khajjassa bhojjassa leyyassa peyyassa. Leyya, from lihati, to lick, could mean something to be licked, perhaps things like honey, molasses, and palm sugar.

1883 Mp : "The perception of impermanence is strong insight that has reached the peak and is an immediate condition for the path" (aniccasaññan ti maggassa anantarapaccayabhāvena sikhāpattabalavavipassanami).

1884 Uttarakuru: the continent to the north of Jambudīpa, perhaps Central Asia.

1885 Ce and Ee visesabhuno. Be visesagunā is likely to be a normalization. Mp offers no help. Mp-t has a description of the living
conditions in Uttarakuru. My rendering is a guess based on the assumption this account is intended to explain visesabhuno.

1886 This sutta combines the three triads defined separately in 3:14042. Hence this may be considered a composite nine. We meet here the same divergence in readings in the second group of horses as we met earlier: Ce and Ee tayo assasadassa, as against Be tayo assaparassa.

1887 The text is abridged thus in all three editions.

1888 These are found, with elaborations, in the Mahānidāna Sutta, at DN 15.9-18, II 58-61.

1889 The nine terms rooted in craving, with explanations from Mp in parenthesis, are: (1) pariyesanā (the seeking of objects such as forms); (2) lābha (the obtaining of objects such as forms); (3) vinicchaya (when one has gained a profit, one makes judgments by thinking what is desirable and undesirable, beautiful and ordinary, how much one will keep and how much give to others, how much use and how much save); (4) chandaräga (weak lust and strong lust, respectively, which arise toward the object thought about with unwholesome thoughts); (5) ajjhosana (the strong conviction in "I and mine"); (6) pariggaha (taking possession by way of craving and views); (7) macchariya (unwillingness to share with others); (8) $\bar{a} r a k k h a$ (guarding carefully by closing doors and storing in boxes); (9) dandädana, etc. (the taking up of rods, etc., for the purpose of warding off others):

$1890 \$ 51-4$ and $6-8$ are included among the seven stations of consciousness at 7:44.

1891 The three editions differ here. I follow Ce bhikkhuno cetasa cittam paricitam hoti. Ee has bhikkhuno cetasa cittam suparicitam hoti, Be bhikkhuno cetasa citam hoti. Citam occurs repeatedly in Be , so it is clearly intentional. Mp (Ce): "One round of the mental process is built up, increased, by another round of the mental process". (cittācārapariyāyena cittācārapariyāyo cito vaḍ̣hito hoti). Mp (Be) has cittavāra-in place of cittācāra-.

1892 All three editions have bhikkhuno cetasa cittam suparicitam hoti. But note that in Ee, Sāriputta's statement on Devadatta's way of teaching does not differ from Candikāputta's statement just above. Both have suparicitam hoti. It is puzzling that the sutta seems to be approving of Devadatta's teaching. Normally we would expect him to be censured for proposing a distorted version of the Dhamma: Perhaps this incident occurred before Devadatta became schismatic.

1893 \$54-6 are, in Pāli, asarāgadhammam, asadosadhammam, asamohadhammam. Mp does not gloss them, but the point seems to be that for the arahant lust, hatred, and delusion are no longer
even capable of arising again. $\$ 87-9$ allude to the three realms of existence.

1894 As at 6:55, but with a different simile.

1895 Text says silāyūpo soḷasakukkuko, a stone pillar sixteen kukkus tall. According to DOP, a kukku is 45 cm , about half a meter. Thus the pillar would be about eight meters.

1896 The number of verbs differ among the editions. Ce, which I follow, has four: n'eva nam kampeyya na sañkampeyya na sampakampeyya na sampavedheyya (but Ce abridges the middle two directions and omits the last verb in relation to the final repetition, apparently an editorial oversight). Ee has three: n'eva nam kampeyya na sañkampeyya na sampavedheyya. Be uses only two verbs: n'eva nam sañkampeyya na sampavedheyya, but three in the simile at 6:55.

1897 Also at 5:179.

1898 On bhayam veram pasavati, Mp says that one obtains the peril of mental fright (cittutrāsabhayaṃ; this favors understanding bhaya as subjective fear rather than objective peril, though I think the latter is actually intended) and enmity as a person (puggalaveram). Spk. II 73,17-33, commenting on SN 12:41, gives a fuller explanation: "Peril and enmity are one in meaning. Enmity is twofold, external and internal. For if one has killed someone's father, the other thinks: 'They say he killed my father; I will kill him.' So the latter takes a sharp knife and pursues the former. The volition arisen in him is called the external enmity [in relation to the future victim]. But the other hears, 'He's coming to kill me' and decides: 'I'll kill him first.' This is called the internal enmity [in relation to himself]. They both pertain to this present life. When the warden of hell sees the murderer reborn in hell, the volition arises in him: 'I'll take a blazing iron hammer and strike him': this is the external enmity pertaining to the future life. And the volition that arises in the victim, 'He's coming to strike me though I'm faultless; I'll strike him first,' is the internal enmity pertaining to the future life. The external enmity is what is called 'enmity as a person' in the [old] Commentary."

1899 Tam kut'ettha labbhā. My translation of this idiom is not intended to be literal. The point is that one has no choice but to resign oneself to the situation. Mp: "What can be done in regard to that person so that there would be no such harmful conduct? By what means is it possible to obtain this?' Having reflected: 'A person harms another because of the disposition of his mind,' one dispels resentment."

1900 SN 36:11, IV 217,4-16, speaks of the "progressive cessation of activities" (anupubbasañkharanaṃ nirodha) in terms very similar to the present sutta, except that it says, "for one who has attained
the first jhāna, speech ( $v \bar{a} c \bar{a})$ has ceased." It is uncertain whether sañkhärā here is intended in the active sense or the passive sense, "activities" or "conditioned phenomena."

1901 All three editions have the singular verb hoti, though Ee notes some manuscripts have plural honti. The subject rūpasañña can be read as either singular or plural.

1902 Anupubbavihärā. Be merely lists their names, that is, "the first jhāna, the second jhāna," etc. Ce and Ee give the full formulas.

1903 Anupubbavihārasamāpattiyo. It is uncertain whether, in this compound, vihärasamāpattiyo should be interpreted as a dvanda ("dwellings and attainments") or as a tappurisa ("attainments of dwellings"). Mp, with its gloss anupatipatiyā samāpajjitabbavihārā, "dwellings to be attained in proper sequence," suggests it is a tappurisa.

1904 I read with Be and Ee tinnā, as against Ce nittanhā, "without craving," which seems less satisfactory in this context. Mp (Be): "Crossed over: crossed over'sensuality" (kämato'tinnā).

1905 Tadangena. Mp: "In that particular respect: with respect to that jhāna factor" (tena jhānañgena).

1906 Upekkhāsukha. Mp does not comment, but I take the compound to be a tappurisa rather than the dvanda "equanimity and pleasure." In the fourth jhāna and beyond upekkhā, equanimity, continues but it is no longer accompanied by sukha, pleasant feeling.

1907 Ce and Ee have the plural verb nirujjhanti here, but the singular nirujjhati in $\S \S 6-8$. Be has the singular nirujjhati here as well. Again, the subject rūpasañ $\tilde{n} \bar{a}$ can be read as either singular or plural.

1908 Mp identifies him as the elder Lāludāyī.

1909 Brahmāli comments: "Since nibbāna is 'extinguishment' (of suffering), any partial extinguishment of suffering is a partial kind of nibbāna."

1910 Though all three editions here read upe(k)khāsahagatā saññāmanasikārā, I follow the Burmese and Sinhala manuscripts referred to in a note in Ee, which read upe(k)khāsukhasahagatā saññāmanasikārā. This fits better with the exposition in 9:33 $\$ 4$ and 9:41 $\$ 4$ than the reading upe (k)khāsahagatā in all three printed editions.

1911 Cited at Vism 153,17-154,8, Ppn 4.130, as testimony that one should first master the jhāna one has just attained before attempting to enter the next higher jhāna.

1912 Tam nimittam. Mp: "That object consisting in the first jhāna" (tam pathamajjhānasankhātam nimittam).

1913 Ubhato bhattho. Bhattha is past participle of bhassati, to drop away, to droop, to fall off.

1914 Anabhihimsamāno. I offer only a literal translation. Based on the
context I understand the sense to be that he does not force himself to aim prematurely for the higher attainment but masters the preceding one before moving on to the next.

1915 Mp: "The characteristic of impermanence is stated by way of two terms: impermanent and disintegrating (aniccato, palokato). The characteristic of non-self is stated by way of three terms: alien (parato), empty (suññato), and non-self (anattato). The characteristic of suffering is stated by the other six terms: suffering (dukkhato), an illness (rogato), a boil (gandato), a dart (sallato), misery (aghato), and affliction (äbädhato).

1916 Mp: "He directs the mind of insight (vipassanācitta) to the unconditioned deathless element by way of hearing, by way of praise, by way of learning, and by way of concepts thus: 'Nibbāna is peaceful.' He directs the mind of the path (maggacitta) to nibbāna simply by making it an object (ārammanakaranavasen'eva), not by saying, 'This is peaceful, this is sublime.' The meaning is that he directs his mind there, penetrating it in this mode."

1917. Ten'eva dhammarāgena tāya dhammanandiyā. Mp: "By desire and attachment to the Dhamma of serenity and insight. So too for 'delight in the Dhamma.' If he can fully exhaust desire and attachment to serenity and insight, he attains arahantship. If not, he becomes a non-returner." Mp-t: "Having abandoned the desire and lust for serenity and insight leading to the lower paths, if he is unable to exhaust the desire for [serenity and insight] leading to the supreme path, he becomes settled in the stage of nonreturning."

1918 See 4:181, 4:196.

1919 Note that rūpa, form, is omitted in describing the formless attainments. Mp: "In the formless attainment there is utterly no form; with reference to this, form is not included."

1920 Mp: "Why is the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception not mentioned? Because of its subtlety: The four formless aggregates in that [attainment] are so subtle that they are not susceptible to exploration [by way of insight]. Hence [just below] the Buddha says: 'There is penetration to final knowledge as far as meditative attainments accompanied by perception reach.' This is meant: 'To the extent that there is an attainment accompanied by mind (sacittakasamāpatti; citta here presumably means "clear and distinct cognition"), there is penetration to final knowledge when one explores [by insight] those gross phenomena, that is, one attains arahantship. But because of its subtlety, the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception is not called an attainment accompanied by perception."

1921 There are some differences between the readings in $\mathrm{Ce}, \mathrm{Ee}$, and

Be. I follow Ce: jhāyīh'ete bhikkhave bhikkhūhi samāpattikusalehi samāpattivutṭhānakusalehi samāpajjitvā vutṭhahitvā samakkhātabbānī ti vadämi. Ee basically agrees with Ce but prints jhäyī h'ete, as if it had a nominative subject followed by emphatic hi. Mp: "Described means to be properly declared, to be explained, extolled, praised simply as 'peaceful and sublime'" (samakkhātabbānī ti sammā akkhātabbāni, "santāni paṇītānī" ti evam kevalam ācikkhitabbāni thometabbāni vamnetabbāni).

1922 On the meaning of "confinement" (sambädha), see 9:42 below.

1923 This is the same as the well-known opening statement of the Satipatṭhāna Sutta, at DN 22:1, II 290,8-11; MN 10.2, I 55,32-56,2. It also occurs in AN at 3:74, 4:194. 6:26, and 10:95.

1924 Mp: "The eye itself . . . will actually be present (tadeva nāma cakkhum bhavissati): the sensitive substance of the eye is itself unimpaired. As well as those forms (te rūpā): that visible-form object itself will have come into range. And yet one does not experience that base (tarīcāyatanam no patisamvedissati): and yet one does not know that visible-form base." I may be wrong in assuming that the nine items are to be obtained by totaling the five kinds of sensory experience with the four formless meditations. Possibly the nine were to be obtained by including the four jhānas (which may have dropped out of the text) with the four formless meditations, and then adding, as the ninth, the special state of concentration referred to at the end of the sutta.

1925 Ce and Be both have $t i$ here, indicating the end of a quotation, which suggests that the speaker of the next paragraph is Udāyī. Yet it is clear that Ānanda himself is still speaking. Thus, it seems, $t i$ is an error and should be deleted from Ce and Be. Ee does not have $t i$.

1926 So Ce and Ee. Be has the name as Jatilavāsikā. Mp says that she was a resident of Jatila city (jatilanagaraväsinī). The jatilas were matted-hair ascetics, but it is questionable whether they were ever numerous enough to constitute a city.

1927 Mp: "Does not lean forward by way of lust, and does not bend back by way of hatred" (rāgavasena na abhinato, dosavasena na apanato).

1928 See 5:27. Here Mp comments: "It is steady, not because one has forcefully and vigorously reined in and suppressed the defilements, but because it has arisen when the defilements are cut off."

1929 Vimuttattā thito, thitattā santusito, santusitattā no paritassati. This sequence is also at SN III 45,13-14, 46,4-5, 54,1-2, 55,34-35, 58,23-24. It is on the basis of the latter passages that I see a change in the subject of the last phrase of the AN text, from "it," referring to the samädhi, to "one," the person who attains it. While in the AN passage, the participles are masculine singular and
thus may be interpreted as referring either to the samädhi or to the person, the SN parallels read: Vimuttattā thitam. Thitattā santusitam. Santusitattā na paritassati. Aparitassam paccattaññeva parinibbāyati. 'Khinā jāti, vusitam brahmacariyam, katam karaniyam, näparam itthattāya'ti pajänätī ti. The neuter singular participles indicate that the subject of the first two phrases is cittam, but with santusitattā na paritassati, the subject seems to shift from cittam to the person attaining liberation. We can infer by analogy that in the present passage a similar shift occurs, in this case from samädhi to the person who attains it.

1930 Ayam, bhante Ananda, samädhi kimphalo vutto bhagavatā. The question is ambiguous. It could mean either, "Of what did the Blessed One say this concentration is the fruit?" or "What did the Blessed One say this concentration has as its fruit?" Mp takes it in the former way, but there are arguments in favor of the latter (see next note).

1931 Ayam, bhagini, samädhi aññāphalo vutto bhagavatā. The compound aññāphalo could be interpreted either as a tappurisa ("this concen-. tration is the fruit of final knowledge") or as a bāhubbthi ("this concentration has final knowledge as its fruit"). In the former case, the samädhi is to be identified with the fruit; in the latter, with an achievement preceding the fruit. Mp takes it in the former sense, as the fruit itself: "The nun asks about the concentration of the fruit of arahantship (arahattaphalasamädhi). Final knowledge is arahantship. The Blessed One has spoken of this concentration of the fruit of arahantship. [The intention is:] When one is percipient with the perception of the fruit of arahantship, one does not experience that base." However, the question kimphalā occurs repeatedly at SN V 118,22-120,19, where it must mean, "What does it have as its fruit?" And in 5:25 we find pañcahi, bhikkhave, añgehi anuggähitä sammäditthi ca cetovimuttiphalā hoti... paññāvimuttiphalā ca hoti. The sense here is not that right view is the fruit of liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, but that right view has liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom as its fruit. Further, in 3:101, a samädhi described in exactly the same terms as this one is shown to be the supporting condition for the six higher knowledges, the last of which is the "the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom." By analogy, it follows that this samädhi is not the fruit of final knowledge, but one that yields final knowledge.

There is a Chinese parallel to this last portion of the sutta, $\mathrm{S} \bar{A}$ 557 at T II 146a12-29. In this version, when the bhikkhuni asks Ānanda the question about the concentration of mind without characteristics (無相心三昧 = animitta cetosamädhi), he replies that the Buddha said this concentration "is the fruit of wisdom, the
reward of wisdom" (智果・智功德, which has the same ambiguity that I mentioned in the preceding note).

1932 Lokāyatikā brāhmanā. See SN 12:48, II 77. Normally, the lokāyatikā are depicted as materialists; here, however, they seem to be simply speculators about the world.

1933 My translation does not follow any of the three editions available to me, which are all problematic. In Be both teachers claim to know an infinite world with infinite knowledge. Pūraṇa Kassapa says: ahaṃ anantena ñāṇena anantạ̣ lokạ̣ jānaṃ passaṃ viharāmi, and Nātaputta [the Jain teacher Mahāvīra] uses exactly the same words. Since this directly contradicts the statement (in all editions) that the two make mutually opposed claims (ubhinnam aññamaññam vipaccanikavādānam), Be must be faulty here. The error is likely to be old, for several Burmese manuscripts and a Siamese manuscript (referred to in Ee's notes) also have this reading.

In Ce and Ee Pūraṇa Kassapa says: ahaṃ anantena ñāṇena antavantạ̣ lokạ̣ jānaṃ passaṃ viharāmi, and Nātaputta says: ahaṃ antavantena ñāṇena antavantạ̣ lokạ̣ jānaṃ passaṃ viharāmi. This reading, too, seems faulty. First, it has Nātaputta claim finite knowledge, when it is known that he claimed omniscience or infinite knowledge. Second, though it makes the two teachers claim different ranges of knowledge; their conclusions about the world are the same. A true contradiction would emerge only if one teacher asserts that the world is infinite and the other that it is finite. I take it that they both claim infinite knowledge (anantena ñāṇena) but differ regarding the extent of the world. Since the Jains actually posit the world to be both, finite and infinite (see just below), I assume the brahmin understands Nātaputta to hold the world to be finite, and thus takes his opponent Pūraṇa Kassapa to posit the world to be infinite. We have no other sources on Pūraṇa's thought with which to understand his cosmology. Elsewhere the crux of Pūraṇa's philosophy is said to be the doctrine of non-doing (DN 2.17, I 52,21-53,4) or the thesis that beings are defiled and purified without cause, or that there is no cause for knowledge and vision (SN 46:56, V 126,26-30). At 6:57 a system of six classes of people is ascribed to him.

Mahāvīra's view of the world is explained in "Various topics prepared on Jain History by Dr. K. C. Jain and his team" (http://www.jainworld.com/literature/jainhistory/chapter4. asp): "It is with regard to these questions [about the world] that Mahāvīra declared: 'From these alternatives, you cannot arrive at truth; from these alternatives, you are certainly led [astray]. The world is eternal as far as that part is concerned which is the substratum (dravya) of the "world"; it is not eternal as far as its
ever-changing state is concerned.' In regard to such questions, Mahāvira's advice to his disciples was neither to support those who maintained that the world is eternal nor those who advocated that it is not eternal. He would have said the same thing regarding such propositions as the world exists and it does not exist; the world is unchangeable; the world is in constant flux; the world has a beginning; the world has no beginning; the world has an end; the world has no end; etc." (my italics).

1934 Be lacks paramāya gatiyā, found in Ce and Ee.

1935 Dalhadhammā dhanuggaho sikkhito katahattho katūpāsano. Mp's comments on these terms differs slightly from its comments at 4:45 (see p. 1690, notes 724 and 725). Here Mp says: "Firm-bowed archer (dalhadhammá dhanuggaho): an archer who has taken up a firm bow. A 'firm bow' (dalhadhanu) is called the 'strength of two thousand' (dvisahassathāmam): a bow to which one can attach an arrow with a head made of some metal such as bronze or lead, etc., fit the arrow notch to the string, grasp the bow handle and draw back the string the full length of the arrow shaft, and shoot the arrow up from the ground. Trained (sikkhito): they have studied the craft in their teacher's clan for ten or twelve years. Skilful (katahattho): one who has simply studied a craft is not yet skillful; they are skillful when they have achieved mastery over it. Experienced (katūpāsano): one who has exhibited his craft in the king's court, etc."

1936 As at 4:45 (and SN 2:26, I 61-62).

1937 Text has evarūpāya sandhāvanikāya here, whereas 4:45 has gamanena. Mp glosses padasā dhāvanena, "running on foot."

1938 Ce and Ee add here bhttā, "frightened," but it seems this word belongs only in the third case, when the devas flee to their city. In Be it occurs only in relation to the third case.

1939 All three editions read here antamakāsi māram. Presumably their editors took this to mean, "who has made an end to Māra." But this is certainly wrong, for two reasons: first, grammatically, this would require the genitive märassa; and second, it is not true that a meditator in jhāna has "made an end to Māra." Elsewhere we find andhamakāsi māram (at MN I 159,19, I 160,5,10, I 174,15-16, and I 175,5), "he made Māra blind" or "blinded Māra," which makes better sense. Ps II 163,4-8, conumenting on MN I 159,19, explains: "He blinded Māra: he did not destroy Māra's eyes, but when a bhikkhu has attained jhāna as a basis for insight, Māra is unable to see the object of his mind. Hence it is said: 'He blinded Māra'" (andhamakāsi māran ti na mārassa akkhtini bhindi. Vipassanāpādakajjhanam samāpannassa pana bhikkhuno imam nāma ārammanam nissāya cittam vattatī ti māro passitum na sakkoti. Tena vuttam "andhamakāsi māran" ti).

1940 Apadam vadhitvä märacakkhum. Mp: "Put out Mara's eyes without a trace: destroyed [them] completely, without remainder (nippadam niravasesam vadhitva)." At MNI 159,19-160,12 and MN I 174,15-175,6 this whole statement is made about all nine meditative attainments, including the four jhānas. There thus seems to be a difference between the textual lineages about the extent to which this statement applies.

1941 Hatthikalabha. Mp glosses as "very big bull elephants" (mahantā mahantā nāgā). This, however, begs the question how these bull elephants differ from the main subject of the simile. Ud 41,20-21 mentions different types of elephants, among them hatthikalabhā (Ee hatthikalāra) which Ud-a 250,12-13 calls elephant offspring (hatthipotaka). They are there distinguished from hatthicchapa, young elephant offspring still being nursed (khirūpagā daharahatthipotaka). I translate in accordance with this explanation.

1942 With Be and Ee, I read mallesu, as against Ce malatesu. SN 42:11 is also set at Uruvelakappa, which is said to be a town of the Mallas (see CDB 1348).

1943 Mp glosses vimuccati here as "liberated from the opposing qualities" (paccanikadhammehi ca vimuccati). Since all three editions, with the support of Mp, have vimuccati, I translate in conformity with this reading, but I think it likely that the original reading was adhimuccati, "resolved upon" or "focused on." As the text unfolds with respect to the successive meditative attainments, in each case the bodhisatta is vimuccatifadhimuccati upon the attainment before he actually achieves it. In such a context being "focused on" rather than "liberated in" makes better sense.

1944 Ce has the genitive plural passatam, while Be and Ee have the genitive singular passato. Mp (Be) has passato in the lemma and a genitive plural in the gloss: 'Etam santan ti passato ti etam nekkhammaṃ santaṃ vigatadarathaparilahhan ti evam passantānam bhikkhūnam. Passato is also found in an older Sinhalà edition. Possibly passato entered the text through an erroneous transposition from the Buddha's account below, where the singular is appropriate.

1945 Mp interprets renunciation (nekkhamma) here as "going forth" (pabbajja) into homelessness. But the text itself seems to allow renunciation as an internal quality, implicitly identified with firm attainment of the first jhāna.

1946 I follow the section divisions of Ee, which conform to the paragraph divisions in Be and show the transitions in the discourse better than the divisions in Ce.

1947 I follow Ee in reading aparena samayena here and in each of
the corresponding sections to come. Ce and Be omit it in later sections.

1948 Here I follow the manuscripts referred to in the note to Ee, which read upekhāsukhasahagatā ("accompanied by the pleasure [connected with] equanimity"). This fits the exposition better than the reading upe ( $k$ )khāsahagatā found in all three printed editions.

1949 In Ce and Be Sāmaññavaggo. Ee names this Pañcālavagga.

1950 The verse occurs at SN 2:7, I 48. Be and Ee have a faulty reading of pāda a in AN, sambādhe gataṃ okāsam, as against Ce sambādhe vata okāsam. The Be and Ee text of SN 2:7 reads vata. Also, in pāda b, Ce has avindi, Ee avidā, two aorist forms meaning "knew." But Be has avidvā, "unknowing, ignorant," which is hard to account for. In SN 2:7 Be also reads the verb as avindi.

1951 See 9:37.

1952 Pariyāyena. Mp: "For a single reason (ekena kāranena). For the first jhāna is called the achievement of an opening with respect merely to the absence of confinement by sensuality, not in every respect."

1953 Yadeva tattha rūpasaññā aniruddhā hoti. The singular verb hoti indicates that "perception" in the singular is intended here. In the immediately following paragraph, however, rūpasaññānam and patighasañãann are genitive plurals.

1954 Nippariyāyena. Mp: "Not just for a single reason, but because it abandons all confinement, the destruction of the taints is called the achievement of an opening in every way."

1955 MN 70.17, I 478,4-8 offers a formal definition of the body witness (kāyasakkhī) as a person who "contacts with the body and abides in those emancipations that are peaceful and formless, transcending forms, and some of his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom." In the present sutta, however, the term "body witness" does not conform to this formal definition but is explained on the basis of a word play. Strictly speaking, the one who attains the complete destruction of the taints is no longer a body witness, a category restricted to those still in training.

1956 Yathā yathā ca tadāyatanam tathā tathā nam kāyena phusitvā viharati. Mp: "Through whatever means or in whatever way there is that base consisting in the first jhāna, by that same means, or in that same way, he dwells having contacted that attainment with the coexistent mental body (sahajātanämakāyena phusitvā)."

1957 As suggested by the previous note, here the term "nonprovisional sense" is itself being used in a loose, "provisional" sense. In the strict, non-provisional sense, such a disciple is not a body witness, for the real body witness has still not reached arahantship.

1958 Again, strictly speaking, according to the formal definition at MN 70.16, I 477,33-36, the one liberated by wisdom (paññāvimutta) is an arahant who does not attain the formless emancipations or the cessation of perception and feeling. Similarly, to meet the formal requirement of "liberated in both respects" (in the following sutta), a disciple must not only realize arahantship but must also attain the formless emancipations, as stated at MN 70.15, I $477,25-28$.

1959 Sikkhadubbalyāni. Lit., "weaknesses in [regard to] to the training." What is intended are not defects in the training itself, but defects in one's observance of the training. Suttas 9:63-92 are all composite nines combining ten different fivefold sets with, successively, the four establishments of mindfulness, the four right strivings, and the four bases for psychic potency.

1960 Ee does not number this vagga. Ce numbers it 5 and Be numbers it (10) 5 , using both the consecutive numbering scheme and the number of the vagga in the set of fifty.

1961 Ce does not number the suttas in the series. Be numbers them in continuity with those in the entire nipata, from 93 to 432. Ee numbers them from 93 to 100 , with no explanation why it ends at 100. I follow the numbering of Be.

1962 Ce has $3-18$, but there are eighteen suttas in this group; the nine perceptions and nine meditative attainments are to be taken collectively with each of the nine terms from "full understanding" to "relinquishment." The eighteen beginning with 3 should thus be added to the two previous suttas so that the present group ends at 20 .

1963 Ce has a note: "The seventeen terms, from 'lust' through 'heedlessness,' are each to be joined with the ten terms beginning with 'for direct knowledge.' These are each to be taken separately with the nine perceptions and the nine meditative attainments, described as 'nine things to be developed.' Thus there are altogether 340 suttas."

# Notes to the Tens

1964 Iti kho, Ānanda, kusalāni sīlāni anupubbena aggāya parenti. Mp glosses aggāya with arahattatthāya.

1965 Dhammatā esā. Mp: "This is the nature of things, the order of causation" (dhammasabhāvo eso kārananiyamo ayam). The point, of course, is not that one need make no volitional effort at all, but that establishing each prior factor serves as a natural supporting condition for each subsequent factor. Thus the effort needed to
arouse the later factor is much less than would be required if the proper supporting condition had not been established.

1966 Iti kho, bhikkhave, dhammā dhamime abhisandenti, dhammā dhamme paripūrenti apārā pāram gamanāya. Mp: "For going from the near shore to the far shore: For going from 'the near shore,' the round of existence with its three planes, to 'the far shore,' nibbāna" (orimattrabhūtā tebhūmakavatṭa nibbānapāram gamanatthāya). It seems that the point in expressing this in terms of dhammā, which I here render "stages," is to show that this process of development unfolds in accordance with natural principles as one stage conditions the arising of the subsequent stage all the way from the beginning of the path to its culmination. This series thus constitutes a "positive" version of dependent origination. We meet this positive version in the Upanisa Sutta (SN 12:23, II 29-32). See my essay on this sutta, Bodhi 1980.

1967 An expanded parallel of 5:24, 6:50, 7:65, and 8:81.

1968 Mp : "He would not take earth as object and be percipient through an arisen perception 'earth." It seems that what is being denied here is a jhāna based on the earth kasina. The same holds below for water, fire, and air. This is confirmed by the next four steps, which negate the four formless bases. In other words, this concentration is not a jhāna based on the kasinas or formless attainments.

1969 Mp identifies this with the concentration of fruition attainment (phalasamāpattisamädhi). This attainment is not the fruition that occurs for a few moments immediately following the path, but a special meditative state accessible only to those who have already attained one of the four paths and its subsequent fruition. The attainment, as shown in this sutta, does not take any of the mundane, conditioned meditation objects as its support; its support is the unconditioned nibbāna, experienced directly and immediately. The commentaries hold that this attainment is graded as fourfold according to the four stages of realization (from stream-entry to arahantship).

1970 Bhavanirodho nibbānam bhavanirodham nibbānam. Mp paraphrases thus: "'On that occasion, friend, I was percipient with the perception of fruition attainment.' Reviewing knowledge (paccavekkhan $\bar{a}$ ) is discussed to show that this attainment was accompanied by mind." In other words, because perception was present, this was not "the cessation of perception and feeling" (saññāvedayitanirodha).

1971 An expanded parallel based on 8:71. See too the part-parallel 9:4.

1972 An expanded parallel based on 8:72.

1973 This is a composite ten. The first set of five is in 5:53.

1974 Still another composite ten.

1975 A composite sutta with part-parallels at 5:205-6 and 9:71-72.

1976 Perhaps, with Be, we should read susamucchinna here, but I follow Ce and Ee, which have simply samucchinna here, though susamucchinna below.

1977 As at 4:34. The series of similes occurs at SN 45:139-47, V 41-45, with the simile of cloth in the tenth place.

1978 An expanded parallel of 9:10.

1979 Nāthakaraña dhammā. Mp: "They act as protectors for oneself, meaning that they act as supports" (attano sanāthabhāvakarā patitthākarā ti attho).

1980 Mp on piyasamudāhāro: "He listens carefully when another is teaching, and he himself desires to teach others." I understand abhidhamme and abhivinaye simply in the referential sense, as explained in note 1086. Mp, however, distinguishes between dhamma as the Sutta Pitaka and abhidhamma as the seven treatises (of the Abhidhamma Pitaka); and vinaya as the twofold Suttavibhanga and abhivinaya as the Khandhakas and Parivāra. This type of explanation presupposes the existence of texts that had probably been compiled several generations after the Buddha's passing.

1981 The text uses the past, present, and future forms of the verb avasati, "abide." Since a literal translation would be clumsy, I have rendered the phrase in accordance with the sense.

1982 As at 6:1.

1983 From this point on the text is an expanded parallel of 6:64. See the latter for notes on the first, second, and seventh powers here. The ten Tathāgata powers are also in MN 12.9-20, I 69-71 and are analyzed in detail at Vibh 336-44 (Be $\S \S 809-31$ ).

1984 Sabbatthagāminim patipadam yathābhūtam ñānam. Vibh 339. (Be $\S 811$ ) identifies this with the Buddha's knowledge of the paths leading to hell, the animal realm, the spirit world, the human world, the deva world, and nibbāna. See MN 12.37-43, I 74-77.

1985 Anekadhātunānādhātulokam yathābhūtam ñānam. Vibh 339 (Be $\S 812$ ) defines this as the Buddha's knowledge of the diversity in the aggregates, sense bases, and elements.

1986 Sattānam nānādhimuttikataṃ yathābhūtam ñānam. Vibh 339 (§813) explains this as the Buddha's knowledge of beings as having inferior or superior dispositions, and his understanding of how those with similar dispositions come together and meet.

1987 Parasattānam parapuggalānam indriyaparopariyattam yathābhūtam ñanam. Vibh 340-42 ( $\S \S 814-27$ ) explains this as the Buddha's knowledge of the condition of sentient beings' diverse
inclinations, underlying tendencies, temperaments, dispositions, intelligence, faculties, characters, receptivity, and potentiality. The terms are all explicated in detail. Mp is more concise, defining it simply as the Buddha's knowledge of whether the five faculties of beings (their faith, etc.) are increasing or declining.

1988 Mp: "The things (ye te dhamma): the knowledge of the ten powers, [or] the things pertaining to the knowledge of omniscience. Doctrinal principles (adhivuttipadānam): principles of designation; this means such things as the aggregates, sense bases, and elements, which are the grounds for the principles of the teaching."

1989 Etadānuttariyaṃ, Ānanda, ñānānaṃ yadidaṃ tattha tattha yathābhūtañānam. Mp: "The knowledge of various phenomena according to their essential nature; by this he shows the knowledge of omniscience" (tesu tesu dhammesu yathāsabhāvañānam; imina sabbaññutañãānam dasseti).

1990 Ce and Be read paññāya disvā disvā. Be does not repeat disvā, but Mp (Be) seems to support the reading of Ce and Be with its gloss: sahavipassanāya maggapaññāya passitvā passitvā pahātabba ("To be abandoned after having repeatedly seen with path wisdom together with insight wisdom").

1991 Papika issā. It is hard to account for the adjective papika, since there are no instances in the texts of a benign type of envy.

1992 Abhibhuyya iriyati, glossed by Mp with vattati.

1993 Mp says that the claims to knowledge, to development, and to both knowledge and development, in the three sections, are all claims to arahantship.

1994 Abhibhuyya titthati. This does not seem to differ in meaning from abhibhuyya iriyati used in the preceding sutta.

1995 Kasināyatanāni. The kasinas are disks representing elements or colors used as objects of samädhi meditation. For example, the earth kasina is a disk filled with reddish brown clay; the water kasina is a bowl of water; the color kasinas are colored disks. Though the meditator begins with a physical disk, when he can see the kasina clearly with his mind's eye, he discards the physical disk and focuses solely on the mental image. As concentration deepens, another image called the "counterpart mark" (paṭibhāganimitta) emerges as an anchor of attention. Vism chaps. 4 and 5 offer a detailed explanation of the kasinas. In the Vism system, the space kasina (which was originally the base of the infinity of space) is replaced by the limited-space kasina, and the consciousness kasina by the light kasina.

1996 "Nondual" (advaya) here refers simply to the presentation of the object and not to an underlying ontological unity. Mp explains: "This is said because one [kasina] does not acquire the quality
of another. For just as, when one enters the water, there is only water and nothing else in all directions, so too, the earth kasina is only the earth kasina. It is unmixed with any other kasina. The same method applies to the others." On appamāna, "measureless," Mp says: "This is stated by way of measureless pervasion of this or that [object]. For pervading it with the mind, one pervades the whole thing; one does not grasp boundaries, thinking: 'This is its beginning, this is its middle.'"

1997 At 1:267 Kālī is called the "foremost of those whose confidence is based on hearsay." Apparently she never met the Buddha but based her trust in him on what she heard from others.

1998 SN 4:25, I 126,15-18. The "maidens" are Māra's daughters, who try to tempt the Buddha after his enlightenment. The question here is specifically that of the daughter Tanhā, "Craving."

1999 Ce and Ee: atthäbhinibbattesum. Be: attho ti abhinibbattesum. Mp: "They generated it, thinking the attainment of the earth kasina is supreme, taking it as the ultimate goal."

2000 Ce and Ee ādimaddasa; Be assādamaddasa. The Ce and Ee reading here is unusual. The standard triad is gratification, danger, and escape (assāda, ādīnava, nissarana), which we find here in Be. The Chinese parallel SĀ 549 (T II 143a2-b17) provides a check on the two alternatives. Though SĀ 549 differs in some respects, the list of insights regarding the kasinas reads: "[He] saw its origin, saw the danger, saw cessation, saw the path to cessation" (見其本・見患・見滅・見滅道節). The Chinese character 本 corresponds to Pāli $\bar{a} d i$, not to assada, thus supporting Ce and Ee against Be , which may have normalized the reading. The Ce and Be readings of Mp differ with respect to the same word.

2001 Sabbam dhammaṃ. I understand the singular to be doing service for the plural sabbe dhamme.

2002 Ce and Ee sabbam dhammaṃ abhiññāya abhiññāya. Be lacks the repetition.

2003 Despite the grammatical form of the sentences, I believe that this rendering does better justice to the sense than a literal translation, "One question, one concise statement, one explanation." The "twos" and higher numbers do not present "two questions, etc.," "three questions, etc.," and so forth, but a question about two items, a question about three items, and so forth.

2004 The Chinese parallel at EĀ 46.8 (T II 778b17) provides some interesting points of contrast. The Pāli version is more cogent with respect to certain items, particularly the fours, fives, sixes, and tens; here EĀ 46.8 has the four noble truths, the five spiritual faculties, the six principles of communal harmony, and the ten kinds of mindfulness (the six recollections, mindfulness of
the body, of death, of breathing, and of peace). E $\bar{A} 46.8$ provides explanations of the items in each group, which calls our attention to what is missing in the Pāli version. While the Pāli version announces three categories for each number-the question (pañha), the concise statement (uddesa), and the explanation (veyyäkarana)-the sutta presents only two, the question and the concise statement, but not the explanation. The Kumārapañha section of the Khuddakapātha (\$4) partly overlaps this list, but since the latter simply lists items to be remembered, without reference to disenchantment and dispassion, it includes positive sets: the four noble truths, the seven enlightenment factors, the eightfold path, and the ten factors of an arahant.

2005 Sabbe sattā ähāratṭhitikā.

2006 Pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant.

2007 Edible food, contact, mental volition, and consciousness. These are called nutriment (ähāra) in the sense that they sustain the continuity of existence.

2008 See 7:44.

2009 See 8:6.

2010 See 9:24.

2011 I follow Be and Ee dasasu akusalesu kammapathesu, as against Ce dasasu akusalesu dhammesu. Ce has dasasu kusalesu kammapathesu at 10:28 $\$ 10$.

2012 Kajañgalika bhikkhunī. It is hard to determine whether this is a proper name or a designation by way of her place of origin. If, however, it were a proper name the text would probably have read Kajañgalikā näma bhikkhunī.

2013 When she speaks about the four establishments of mindfulnessand below about the five faculties, the six elements of escape, the noble eightfold path, and the ten wholesome deeds-the formulation changes. Instead of saying, "is completely disenchanted with ...completely dispassionate toward them, completely liberated from them" (sammā nibbindamāno sammā virajjamāno sammā vimuccamāno), she says: "has a mind completely well developed in" (sammā subhāvitacitto).

2014 The Pāli editions abridge the text thus.

2015 See 6:13.

2016 This cosmology is also at 3:80.

2017 Yebhuyyena sattā äbhassarasaṃvattanikā bhavanti. This seems to mean that they are reborn among the äbhassara devas, the highest plane corresponding to the second jhāna. It remains while all the lower planes of existence undergo dissolution.

2018 As above at 10:25.

2019 As at 8:65.

2020 As at 4:161-62.

2021 Mp does not comment, but I assume these four perceptions are sense-sphere perception, perception in the four jhānas, perception in the first two formless attainments, and perception in the base of nothingness.

2022 See pp. 1780-82, note 1532.

2023 Yā cāyaṃ bhave appaṭikulyatā, sā c'assa na bhavissati, yā cāyaṃ bhavanirodhe pātikulyatā, sā c'assa na bhavissati. The point, it seems, is that because annihilationism arises from aversion toward continued personal existence, the annihilationist welcomes the cessation of existence, though from the Buddha's perspective annihilationism goes too far by misinterpreting such cessation as the annihilation of a real self or existent person. See It §49, $43-44$.

2024 Paramatthavisuddhim paññāpenti. Mp: "This is a designation for the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. For the base of nothingness is highest as the foundation for insight, but the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception is highest in terms of long lifespan."

2025 Paramaditthadhammaṃ nibbānaṃ paññāpenti. See DN 1.3.19-25, I 36-38, where five views of "supreme nibbāna in this very life" are examined. These hold that supreme nibbāna is the unrestrained enjoyment of the five kinds of sensual pleasure or each of the four jhānas (taken individually). The Buddha opposes these here with the assertion that supreme nibbāna is attained by fully understanding the six sense bases for contact. The same is said at DN 1.3.71, I 45,17-20.

2026 Mp glosses "full understanding" (pariñ $\tilde{n} \bar{a}$ ) here with overcoming (samatikkama). The full understanding (or overcoming) of sensual pleasures occurs by the first jhāna; the full understanding of form, by the formless meditative attainments; and the full understanding of feelings, by the attainment of nibbāna, where all feeling has been stilled.

2027 Mp explains the historical background: When King Kosala the Great (Pasenadi's father) presented his daughter in marriage to Bimbisāra (the king of Magadha), he gave her the village of Kāsi (between the two kingdoms) as a wedding gift. Years later, after Ajātasattu killed his father Bimbisāra, his mother died of grief. Pasenadi decided: "Since Ajātasattu killed his parents, the village belongs to my father." Ajātasattu, too, thought: "It belongs to my mother." The two, uncle and nephew, fought a war over Kāsi. Pasenadi was twice defeated by Ajātasattu and had to flee the battle, but on the third occasion he captured Ajātasattu. This
was the purpose of which it is said "his purpose having been achieved" (laddhädhippāyo).

2028 At MN II 120,1-4 King Pasenadi makes a similar demonstration of reverence for the Buddha and gives ten reasons for showing the Buddha such supreme honor and love. However, the individual items there differ from these.

2029 Bahuno janassa ariye ñāye patitṭhāpitā yadidaṃ kalyānadhammatāya kusaladhammatāya. Mp glosses "in the noble method" as "in the path along with insight" (sahavipassanake magge). I follow PED in taking patitṭhāpitā to be an agent noun in the nominative singular.

2030 Though sikkhapadaṃ is singular, I understand the statement here to refer to the whole corpus of training rules and I thus translate in the plural. In the Vinaya Pitaka, this statement occurs in connection with the laying down of the first pārā̄ika and the singular is therefore appropriate; see Vin III 21,15-23.

2031 Ee mistakenly joins this sutta to the previous one, thus reducing the count by one. At Vin II 240-47 "suspending the Pātimokkha" (pātimokkhatthapana) refers to canceling an individual's right to participate in the Pātimokkha recitation on the uposatha. It seems to me that in the present sutta "suspending the Pātimokkha" includes both canceling the Pātimokkha recitation for a particular monk and delaying the recitation of the Pātimokkha until an obstructive condition has been removed. See Thānissaro 2007b: 270-71, for a discussion of the former set of conditions under which the Pātimokkha recitation is canceled.

2032 Pärājikakathā vippakatā hoti. Mp: "Such talk as this, 'Did such a person commit a pārājika or not?' has been started and has not been concluded ('asukapuggalo pārājikaṃ āpanno nu kho no' ti evaṃ kathā ārabhitvā anitṭhāpitā hoti)." Note that this passage supports the translation of the stock question that the Buddha asks the monks when they are in conversation-kā ca pana vo antarākathā vippakatā?-as: "What was your conversation that was underway?" The common alternatives-"What was your conversation that was interrupted?" and "What was your conversation that has been concluded?"-do not work in this context, and in any case are contradicted by the commentaries, which consistently gloss vippakatā as meaning "not brought to a conclusion, not completed" (aparinitthitā sikhaṃ appattā at Sv I 49,27-28, Ps II 169,15-16; pariyantam na gatā at Ps III 226,1-4; apariyositā at Ud-a 104,26-30).

2033 The word pandaka has a wider meaning than "eunuch" as usually understood. Sp V 1016,1-9 describes five types of pandakas. Of these, the two most relevant here are the castrated male (opakkamikapandaka) and the person born sexually indeterminate
(napunsakapandaka). A parallel of this distinction can be found in Matthew 19:12 (English Standard Version): "For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven." The first correspond to the napuṃsakas, the second to the opakkamikas, and the third perhaps to those who choose celibacy (or castrate themselves) for religious reasons.

2034 The implications of bhikkhunidūsaka are not spelled out in the canonical texts themselves. However, the Vinayavinicchaya-tika I 121 (VRI ed.; Be $\S 322$ ) defines the term in a way that applies to a bhikkhu who has had sexual intercourse of any kind with a bhikkhuni: "One is said to be a bhikkhunidūsaka when one has defiled a bhikkhunī in good standing by having sexual relations with her" (dūsako ti pakatattāya bhikkhuniyā methunaṃ paṭisevitvā tassā dūsitattā bhikkhunim dūsetīti "bhikkhunidūsako"ti vutto ca). Thus the term does not necessarily imply rape and "seducer of a bhikkhuni" should be a fit rendering.

2035 Ubbähika. DOP defines as "the reference (of a dispute) to a committee of selected bhikkhus." Mp: "Adjudication means picking out, selecting from the Sangha to settle a disciplinary issue that has arisen" (sampatta-adhikaranaṃ vūpasametuṃ sanghato ubbāhitva uddharitvā gahanatthāya). The procedure is described in detail at Vin II 95,25-97,16.

2036 Mp: "The four kinds of disciplinary issues." The four are a dispute, an accusation, an offense, and proceedings (vivädadhikarana, anuvādādhikarana, āpattādhikarana, kiccādhikarana). See MN 104.12-20, II 247-50.

2037 Mp defines this as the seven ways of settling disciplinary issues (satta adhikaranasamathā).

2038 Ee merges this sutta with the preceding one, so that from this point on my numbering exceeds Ee's by two.

2039 Ee treats this as the end of the sutta and the next sentence as the beginning of a separate sutta, which it numbers 38. Thus Ee's numbering of the suttas catches up on one of the two suttas by which it fell behind earlier.

2040 Kappatṭhiyam kibbisam pasavati. Mp glosses kibbisam with pāpam and says that the question concerns the cause for dwelling in hell for āyukappa, the "life eon." Such an account of the word kappa is not found in the Nikāyas and seems to be a commentarial innovation. See p. 1811, note 1786.

2041 As above, Ee treats this as the end of the sutta and the next sentence as the beginning of a separate sutta, which it numbers 40 . Thus Ee's numbering now matches that of the other editions.

2042 I add the word "mutual" on the basis of Mp's gloss: aññamaññassa sanggahānuggaho.

2043 For explanations of these terms, see p. 1602, note 66.

2044 This sutta combines two fivefold sets and can thus be considered a composite ten.

2045 Ce guyhavantā should be corrected to guyhamantā, as in Be and Ee. Here guyhamantā almost certainly means "secret deliberations," not "secret mantras."

2046 Mp glosses pattheti with māretum icchati, "wishes to kill." I do not see how a desire to kill can be derived from the Palli and thus prefer to take pattheti in its usual sense, as simply "to wish, to long for." My guess as to its relevance here is that a man who has fathered a son through one of the concubines wants to see his son, and a concubine's son who learns that he was sired by a man other than the king wants to meet his real father, and the king suspects the monk of being the go-between.

2047 Ce and Be read hatthisammaddam; Ee has hatthisammadam in the text, but - sammaddam and -sambādham as alternative readings: Mp (Be) reads hatthisambädham, resolved as hatthīhi sambādham ("crowded with elephants"). Mp (Ce) allows this reading too, though its text seems corrupted. Both editions of Mp recognize the alternative hatthisammaddam.

2048 The eight factors are the eight uposatha precepts, on which see 8:41.

2049 Ce and Ee stop at fifty kahāpanas, but Be adds a hundred kahāpanas. The kahāpana was the major currency unit of the time.

2050 Lit., "a hundred times a hundred years" (satampi vassasatāni).

2051 Lit., "a hundred times a hundred thousand years" (satampi vassasatasahassāni).

2052 Because of the ambivalence of the word kamma (meaning both "a deed" and "the potential for results created by a deed"), the question and the reply might also have been formulated in terms of "a bad deed." The same holds below in regard to good kamma.

2053 Vevanniy'amhiajjhupagato. The four main classes of Indian society in the Buddha's time were referred to as vanna, lit., "color," and thus the privative form, vivanna, should mean "without class" or "classless." Vevanniya is the abstract noun, "classlessness," implying that those who go forth give up their prior status as brahmin, khattiya, vessa, sudda, or outcast, and become known simply as ascetics following the Sakyan son (see 8:19 §4). By the time of the commentaries the original meaning seems to have been forgotten, and thus Mp takes the word in the sense of "plain" or "without adomment": "Vevanniya is twofold: with respect to
body and with respect to articles of use. Vevanniya with respect to body means shaving off the hair and beard. Vevanniya with respect to articles of use means wearing ochre robes made from stitched-together pieces of cloth; eating food mixed together with water in an iron or clay bowl; sleeping at the foot of a tree, etc., and lying down on mats made of reeds and grass, etc.; sitting on a strip of leather or cloth, etc.; and using fermented cow's urine, etc., for medicine. When one reflects thus, anger and conceit are abandoned."

2054 Parapatibaddhā me jivikā. Monastics do not work at salaried jobs to earn money with which to purchase their requisites but receive all their material supports-robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medi-cines-as offerings from the lay community. One does not make use of the four requisites without having reflected upon them.

2055 Añño me ākappo karànīyo. Mp: "Laypeople walk by swelling up their chest, lifting their heads high, in a playful manner, with disorderly steps. But my manner must be different. I must walk with calm sense faculties, with a calm mind, with slow and measured steps, like a cart passing through water or a rough place."

2056 Here and in the next reflection the intended sense is conveyed more clearly in English if $n a$ is not translated.

2057 This and the following reflection are in 5:57.

2058 Ponobhavikobhavasañkhāro. Mp: "The kamma that creates existence, the active production of renewed existence" (ponobbhaviko ti punabbhavanibbattako, bhavasañkhāro ti bhavasañkharanakammam). Presumably this is said to subsist through the body because the body is the instrument for forming and expressing volition.

2059 The formula is the same as that at 6:12, though the content is different. The ten principles are the same as the "ten qualities that make for a protector" at 10:18.

2060 Ce paripuṇnam should be corrected to parisuddham as in Be and Ee. Ce reads parisuddham in the parallel passage occurring in the later suttas of the chapter, so it is clear that paripuṇnam is a typographical error.

2061 A Chinese parallel, MĀ 110 (T I 598c21-599b7), differs slightly from the Pāli in its list of defilements and their wholesome opposites. It includes lack of faith and faith, muddle-mindedness and mindfulness, and foolishness and wisdom. Faith, mindfulness, and wisdom-together with energy and concentration (overlapping with the Pāli list)-constitute the five spiritual faculties, considered as absent or present.

2062 I use "decline," to render parihāni and "deterioration" to render häni. The two are virtually synonymous.

2063 The following self-examination is modeled on 4:93.

2064 This portion of the sutta is modeled upon 9:6, but it takes associating with a person last and does not treat it in as much detail.

2065 A similar passage is at 6:51. In the present sutta, Be and Ee read the second item as sammosam gacchanti, lit. "go to forgetting," which seems preferable to Ce sammoham gacchanti, "go to delusion." In 6:51 all three editions read na sammosam gacchanti, which is supported by Mp's gloss: vināsam na gacchanti ("they are not lost"). Here and below, where Ce and Ee read pubbe cetaso samphutthapubbā, Be has the negative pubbe cetaso asamphutthapubbā, "with which he had previously not been familiar." This is likely to be a typographical error; at 6:51 Be reads, in conformity. with Ce and Ee, pubbe cetaso samphutthapubbā.

2066 An expanded parallel of 5:61, 7:48, and 9:16.

2067 The last five contemplations are among the ten foulness meditation subjects dealt with in detail in Vism chap. 6.

2068 An expanded parallel, based on 8:83. It also has a close correspondence with 9:14, which poses nine of the questions, but in terms of "intentions and thoughts" (sankappavitakkā) rather than "all things" (sabbe dhammā).

2069 The last two items, amatogadhā sabbe dhammā and nibbānapariyosānā sabbe dhammā, seem to be synonymous. A Chinese parallel, MĀ 113 (at T I 602c1-16), makes the following assertions: "All things are rooted in desire; all come together in contact; all converge on feeling; all originate from attention; all are stopped by mindfulness (see Sn 1035); all are headed by concentration; wisdom is above all; liberation is the truth (or core) of all; all have nibbāna as their consummation." Interestingly, MĀ 113 continues (at T I 602c17-28) with a passage that in AN corresponds to the next sutta, 10:59, though rather than assure the monk who practices in such a way one of two fruits, it states that he will definitely attain arahantship.

2070 Na c'uppannā pāpakā akusalā dhammā cittam pariyādāya thassanti. As phrased, the text seems to be saying that such bad unwholesome qualities do arise but do not gain control over the bhikkhu's mind. However, it is possible the intent of the statement is that such bad unwholesome qualities do not arise and gain control over his mind.

2071 Lokassa samañca visamañca. Mp: "Good conduct and misconduct in the world of beings" (sattalokassa sucaritaduccaritāni).

2072 Lokassa bhavañca vibhavañca. Mp glosses as "its growth and destruction, also success and failure."

2073 Perceptions $\S \S 8-10$ will be explained just below in 10:60.

2074 Apart from this text there is no further information about Girimānanda in the Nikāyas. In Theravāda Buddhist countries
this sutta has achieved the status of a paritta, a "protective discourse," which bhikkhus often recite to people afflicted with illness.

2075 In Be only, ottharogo, lip disease, is between dantarogo and kāso.

2076 Both this and the following perception are reflective contemplations on nibbāna. In the classical scheme of forty meditation subjects, they can be subsumed under the "recollection of peace" (upasamānussati), explained at Vism 293-94, Ppn 8:245-51.

2077 Where Ce and Ee read pajahanto viramati anupadiyanto, Be has pajahanto viharati anupadiyanto. Mp offers no clarification.

2078 It is hard to see exactly how the explanation is connected to the theme of impermanence. Some manuscripts read this perception as sabbasañkha $\bar{a} r e s u$ anicchāsañ $\bar{n} \bar{a}$, "perception of wishlessness (or desirelessness) in regard to all conditioned phenomena," which seems to tie up better with the definition.

2079 The mental activity (cittasañkhāra) here is perception and feeling, for these things are said to be bound up with the mind and to occur in dependence on it (see MN 44.15, I 301,28-29).

2080 That is, liberating the mind from the obstacles to the refinement of serenity and insight.

2081 I read this sentence thus: "Purimā bhikkhave koṭi na paññāyati avijjāya, ito pubbe avijja nāhosi atha pacchā samabhavī" ti: evametam bhikkhave vuccati. The punctuation in all three editions gives the impression that the only part of the Pāli sentence that forms a direct quotation is that between ito pubbe and sambhavi. I think it more likely that evametam bhikkhave vuccati applies to the statement as a whole, from purimā through sambhavi, rather than to only part of it, and I translate accordingly.

2082 Mp glosses "has a nutriment" (sāhāram) with "has a condition" (sapaccayam).

2083 Though there are only nine items in the first part of this sutta (the negative series), it appears to be included in the Tens because there are ten items in the second part (the positive series). The next sutta uses the same scheme but augmented in the first part by craving for existence.

2084 There is a word play here. "Have reached certainty about me" (mayi nittham gata) is an idiom meaning that a person has achieved secure faith in the Buddha, the mark of a stream-enterer. But nitth $\bar{a}$ also means goal, namely, arahantship. Thus reaching certainty about the Buddha marks the attainment of stream-entry (or higher stages), while gaining the goal marks the attainment of arahantship. In the light of this distinction, Mp explains "gain the goal here in this world" (idha nitthā) as "reach final nibbāna in this very world" (imasmiṃyeva loke parinibbānaṃ). "This world" (idha, lit., "here") obviously means the sense sphere, since the
stream-enterer and once-returner may reach the goal in a heavenly realm and not necessarily in the human realm. Mp says that "having left this world" (idha vihäya) means "in the pure abodes of the brahmā world (suddhāvāsabrahmalokam)."

2085 Ekabīī, kolamkola, and sattakkhattuparama. These are three grades of stream-enterers in the technical sense. They are distinguished according to the sharpness of their spiritual faculties. For the distinctions between them, see 3:89.

2086 For the distinctions between these five kinds of non-returners, see 7:55. They are mentioned in relation to the threefold training at 3:87 and 3:88.

2087 Here the text uses the word sotāpanna in a loose sense. Mp-says it means those who have entered the "stream" of the noble path (ariyamaggasotam āpanna). The word thus applies to disciples at all four stages of awakening.

2088 Ee omits this passage, though acknowledging its presence in the manuscripts it drew upon. Ce and Be both include it. The transition to the Buddha's talk on the ten grounds of praise is unclear, unless we assume that, as in the preceding sutta, the Buddha had visited the monks and reproached them for engaging in pointless talk.

2089 This is a more compressed version of MN 6, I 33-36. The latter includes sections on the three lower stages of realization and the five mundane direct knowledges but excludes $\S \S 5-6$ of this sutta.

2090 An expanded parallel of 5:63 and 5:64.

2091 A part-parallel of 6:44, with similar setting but different contents.

2092 Ce pettā pi yo; Be pitāmaho; Ee pettā piyo. PED explains pitamahā (under pitar) as "grandfather," which seems unlikely here. PED, under pettāpiya (epic Skt pitṛvya), gives "father's brother, paternal uncle," which can thus support Ce and Ee if the spaces are eliminated. See too pp. 1758-59, note 1330.

2093 I take $\mathrm{Ce}-\bar{n} \bar{a} n 0$ here to be a misprint for $-\bar{n} \bar{a} n e$, which occurs in the repetition of the statement toward the end of the sutta. In 6:44, Ce has $-\bar{n} \bar{a} n e$ in both places.

2094 Dussilyam aparisesam nirujjhati. Mp: "Here, the five kinds of immorality are abandoned by the path of stream-entry; the ten [courses of unwholesome kamma], by the path of arahantship. At the moment of fruition they are said to have been abandoned. By nirujjhati the text here refers to the moment of fruition. A worldling breaks virtuous behavior in five ways: by committing a parajika offense, by giving up the training, by joining another sect, by reaching arahantship, and by death. The first three lead to the decline of development, the fourth to its growth, and the
fifth neither to decline nor growth. But how is virtuous behavior broken by reaching arahantship? Because a worldling can have extremely wholesome virtuous behavior, but the path of arahantship leads to the destruction of wholesome and unwholesome kamma; thus it is broken in that way." This, it should be pointed out, is explained from the Abhidhamma standpoint, according to which an arahant's actions, being mere activities (kiriya) without kammic result, are not classified as either wholesome or unwholesome. In the language of the suttas, however, they would be described as extremely wholesome.

2095 I translate on the basis of Ce and Be, which read tayo me. Ee consistently reads only tayo, without me.

2096 I read with Ce and Ee micchädiṭthika, as against Be papamitta, "have bad friends."

2097 An expanded parallel of 9:29.

2098 Atthäne ca kuppati. Mp: "In relation to some intentionally motivated event there can be a reason [for getting angry], as when someone acts for my harm, and so forth. But this is not the case when one injures oneself against tree stumps and so forth. Therefore, in this case it is said that the resentment is without a reason (atthäne äghäto)."

2099 An expanded parallel of 9:30.

2100 Also in 4:36.

2101 An expanded parallel of 8:82.

2102 I here read with Be Sati kho pana ayamäyasmā uttari karanīye, as against Ce and Ee Mutthassati kho pana ayamāyasmā uttari karanīye, "This venerable one, who is muddle-minded, when there is something further to be done ..." In Be sati is a present participle used in a locative absolute construction; it is totally unrelated to the noun sati meaning mindfulness. Possibly the reading mutthassati arose through the influence of 10:85 $\$ 7$ below.

2103 Ce repeats the exchange here once more, with the trickster telling his companion to dig still again. I follow Be and Ee, which omit this repetition.

2104 As with 10:84 $\mathbf{\$ 1 0}$, I prefer the Be reading.

2105 This is the name in Ce. Ee reads kälakam, which could also be taken as a proper name. But Be has kälakatam, which means "one who has died."

2106 Ayampi dhammo na piyatāya na garutāya na bhāvanāya na sāmaññāya na ekibhāvāya samvattati. Mp glosses na sāmaññāya with na samanadhammabhāvāya "nor to the state [or duty] of an ascetic." Mp obviously takes sāmañña to be derived from samana. However, the word sāmañña is also an abstract noun from samāna, meaning "the same" or "similar," and I believe this is the sense
intended here. I translate it as "accord," which agrees well with the next word, ekibhāvāya. See too p. 1791, note 1623. Mp does not gloss bhāvanāya, but in commenting on 8:2 it allows two alternatives, "meditative development" and "esteem. for virtues." In this context I have taken the latter to be intended. A Chinese parallel, MĀ 94, at TI 576a23-25, has for bhāvanāya, 不能令修習, "nor to meditative development"; and for sāmañña, 不能令得沙門, "nor to obtaining the ascetic state." Despite this agreement between Mp and MĀ 94, I still think it possible that the words were misunderstood at an early period and prefer my rendering.

2107 This partly, replicates 5:211, but the difference in formulation is too prominent for it to be called an expanded parallel of the earlier sutta.

2108 With Ce, Be, and Mp (Ce and Be) I read saddhammassa na vodāyanti. Ee has the singular verb vodāyati, but the notes in Ee also refer to mss with vodayanti. Saddhammassa should be resolved saddhāmmā assa. Mp: "The good qualities of the teaching, consisting in the three trainings, do not become polished for him" (sikkhāttayasañkhātā sāsanasaddhammā assa vodānaṃ na gacchanti).

2109 Versions of this sutta are also at SN 6:9-10 and Sn 3:10.

2110 Mā h'evam Kokālika, mā h'evam Kokālika. Sn p. 124 has the same reading, but SN I 150,7-8 reads: mā h'evam Kokālika avaca, mā h'evam Kokālika avaca.

2111 The unripe belli fruit is about the size of a peach, the ripe fruit the size of a pomegranate.

2112 The sutta refers to Tudu as a paccekabrahimā. Neither Mp nor Mp-t define the term, but Spk-pt I 213 (VRI ed.), commenting on its occurrence at SN I 146,26-27, explains it as a brahmā who travels about alone, not as a member of an assembly (paccekabrahmā ti ca ekacārī brahmā, na parisacārī brahmāti attho). Mp says that in his past life he had been Kokālika's preceptor. He passed away as a non-returner and was reborn in the brahmā world. When he heard that Kokālika was slandering Sāriputta and Moggallāna, he came to request him to place confidence in them.

2113 Since the Buddha had declared Tudu a non-returner, Kokālika reproaches him for reappearing in the human world. As a nonreturner he does not, of course, take rebirth into the human world, but he can manifest himself before humans.

2114 The following three verses are at $4: 3$.

2115 In the Indian numbering system one koti $=$ ten million; a koti of kotis = one pakoti; a koti of pakotis = one kotipakoti; a koti of kotipakotis = one nahuta; a koti of nahutas = one ninnahuta; a koti of ninnahutas = one abbuda; twenty abbudas = one nirabbuda.

2116 Mp states that the red-lotus (paduma) hell is not a separate hell realm but a particular place in the great avici hell where the duration of the torment is measured by units of padumas. The same applies to the abbuda hell, etc., mentioned below.

2117 Ce should be corrected by bringing the word digham down a line. Thus the paragraph begins with evam vutte and the question with kiva digham nu kho bhante. The mistake is in both the printed and electronic versions of Ce.

2118 An expanded parallel of 8:28.

2119 In Ee titled Upāsakavagga, "The Chapter on Lay Disciples."

2120 This is a part-parallel of SN 42:12, IV 331-37, but differing slightly in arrangement. Where there are mixed grounds for praise and criticism, SN 42:12 enumerates all the grounds for praise and criticism together, each in its own group, whereas the present sutta takes each item in the order in which it occurs, designating it a ground for either criticism or praise.

2121 The three variables of the pattern to be elaborated are: (i) how wealth is acquired, whether unrighteously, righteously, or both; (ii) whether or not it is used for one's own benefit; and (iii) whether or not it is used to benefit others. Those who rank positively on all three will be further divided into those who are attached to their wealth and those who are unattached to it.

2122 An expanded parallel of 9:27. It differs only by the addition of the section on dependent origination, which is also in the version of SN 12:41, II 68-70, a full parallel.

2123 Mp: "The noble method (ariya ñāya) is the path together with insight."

2124 This sutta is probably included in the Tens because of the ten views.

2125 Evam kho te, gahapati, moghapurisa kālena kālam sahadhammena suniggahitam niggahetabba. Mp glosses sahadhammena as "with a cause, with a reason, with a statement" (sahetukena kāranena vacanena).

2126 Vibhajjavādī bhagavā, na so bhagavā ettha ekamsavādi. The expression vibhajjavädi, used to describe the Buddha, is sometimes understood to mean that the Buddha analyzes things into their component parts. But the use of the term here (and elsewhere in the Nikāyas) shows that it actually means that the Buddha draws the distinctions needed to avoid making broad generalizations that overlook important ambiguities. See how the term is employed at MN 99.4, II 197,10-18.

2127 Like 10:93, this sutta was probably included in the Tens because it deals with the ten speculative views.

2128 Mp: "The most elevated question of all: 'Do not let him acquire the
bad view: "When I ask the ascetic Gotama the ultimate question, he falters and does not reply. Is it the case that he isn't up to the mark and cannot answer?""

2129 Mp: "The same question: He shows that Uttiya again asked the same invalid question that he had previously posed in terms of whether the world is eternal. He asks from a different angle about the entire world, taking a stand on the belief in a sentient being (sattūpaladdhiyamyeva thatvā añ̃̃enākārena pucchati)."

2130 In Be and Ee, Kokanuda.

2131 At 4:38 and 6:54, I render ditthitthāna as "viewpoint," but here as "basis for view." I follow Mp, which glosses the word in its earlier occurrences as meaning views themselves, but here as "causes for views" (ditthikārana). Mp mentions eight such causes: the aggregates, ignorance, contact, perception, thought, careless attention, bad friends, and another person's utterance (khandh $\bar{a}$, avijjā, phasso, sañ̃̃ā, vitakko, ayoniso manasikāro, pāpamittā, paraghoso).

2132 I follow Be, whose reading of this stock passage conforms to the sequence found elsewhere in AN. Ce and Ee invert the order of the "exalted," "concentrated," and "liberated" dyads, so that the superior consistently follows the inferior state. The Ce and Ee readings of all the earlier AN suttas use the sequence of the Be reading, and there seems no reason here for this sequence to be inverted.

2133 Mp: "He will sink (samsīdissati) because of sensual thoughts, or float away (uplavissati) because of thoughts of ill will and harming."

2134 Much of the following comes from the standard sequence on the progressive training, already at 4:198.

2135 No ca kho tāva anuppattasadattha viharanti. The stock formula for the arahant, at 3:37 and 6:49, describes the arahant as one who has "reached his own goal" (anuppattasadattho). Thus Mp II 235,14-15, and Mp III 380,17-18, commenting on the formula, identify sadattha with arahantship.

2136 I read with Be anuppattasadattha ca viharanti, which seems necessary. Ce and Ee have, as in the earlier passages, no ca kho tava anuppattasadattha viharanti, "but they still have not attained their own goal." Since only nine meditative attainments are mentioned, it is unclear what justifies the inclusion of this sutta in the Tens. To obtain ten stages, I have divided the last stage into two parts, but I am unsure this was the original intention.

2137 Sanghe te viharato phāso bhavissati. Lit., "For you dwelling in the Sangha, there will be ease [or comfort]." Mp: "[The Buddha] asks him to live in the midst of the Sangha and does not permit him
to live in the forest. Why? [He thought:] 'If he lives in the forest, he will fulfill only the task of practice, not the task of learning. But if he lives in the midst of the Sangha, he will fulfill the two tasks, attain arahantship, and become the foremost expert in the Vinaya Pitaka. Then, I will explain his past aspiration and resolution and appoint him as the foremost bhikkhu among the experts in the Vinaya.' Seeing this benefit, the Master did not permit Upāli to live in the forest."

2138 Samanasañ $\bar{n} \bar{a}$. Identical with the first three of the "ten things that one who has gone forth should often reflect upon." See 10:48 for notes on these three themes.

2139 All three true knowledges are abridged in the text.

2140 Ps I 188,32-189,4, commenting on MN I 42,28, explains wrong knowledge (micchānāna) as the delusion (moha) that arises when someone, having done a bad deed or pondered a bad thought, reflects on it and thinks, "I have done good." Wrong liberation (micchāvimutti) arises when someone who is not liberated thinks "I'm liberated," or it is the belief that what is not liberation is true liberation.

2141 At Ps I 188,35-189,9 right knowledge (sammā̄̄̄̄na) is explained to be the nineteen kinds of reviewing knowledge (see Vism 676,4-29, Ppn 22.20-21) and right liberation (sammāvimutti) to be the mental factors concomitant with fruition. I find it simpler to interpret "right knowledge" as the direct knowledge that culminates in arahantship and "right liberation" as the release of the mind from the āsavas and other defilements.

2142 An expanded parallel based on 1:314 and 1:315.

2143 The same sutta, but only as far as micchāsamādhi and sammāsamādhi, is SN 45:1, V 1-2. Mp does not offer any substantial comment here, but Spk III 116,5-6, commenting on the same sentence in SN 45:1, explains that ignorance is a forerunner (pubbanggama) in two ways, as co-arisen condition (sahajāta, a condition for simultaneously arisen phenomena) and as decisive-support condition (upanissaya, a strong condition for subsequently arisen phenomena). Spk-pt II 103 (VRI ed.) adds that ignorance is a co-arisen forerunner when it makes simultaneous states conform to its own confusion about the object, so that they grasp impermanent phenomena as permanent, etc. It is both a co-arisen and decisivesupport forerunner when a person overcome by delusion, not seeing the danger, takes life, steals, commits sexual misconduct, speaks falsely, and engages in other immoral actions.

2144 At Spk III 117,27-31 it is said that these do not occur all together in the mundane path but occur together in the world-transcending path. Even in the development of the mundane path it would be
a mistake to suppose the eight factors follow in sequence. Right view is the guide for the other path factors and the direct condition for right intention. Right view and right intention jointly condition right speech, right action, and right livelihood. These in turn are the basis for right effort and right mindfulness. Right concentration results from the interplay of right effort and right mindfulness. Right knowledge (sammā ñāna) is the wisdom of the path of arahantship, and right liberation (sammā vimutti) is the liberation from the asavas that occurs through right knowledge. Its culmination is the arahant's anāsava cetovimutti paññãvimutti ("taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom").

2145 Nijjarā. The "wearing away" of old kamma through austerities was a fundamental Jain concept. The Buddha borrows the word but gives it a new meaning. See too 3:74 for three kinds of "wearing away" taught by the Buddha.

2146 Mp explains that in this country, people do not cremate their dead relatives but bury them. After their bodies have decayed, they excavate the bones, wash them, arrange them in order, and worship them with scents and garlands. When an [auspicious] constellation arrives, they take the bones and wail and lament, after which they play [the game of] constellation.

2147 Asekha. A term for an arahant, who has completed the training in the noble eightfold path and thus possesses, beyond the eight path factors, right knowledge (sammāãana) and right liberation (sammāvimutti).

2148 Adhammo ca bhikkhave veditabbo anattho ca; dhammo ca veditabbo attho ca. Here dhamma should be understood more in the sense of the principle of goodness and truth than in the narrow sense of the Buddha's teaching. And attha should be understood in the sense of what is good, beneficial, and profitable (in a spiritual sense), what leads to one's long-term well-being and happiness. The word also means "meaning." Often dhamma and attha are paired off as two things that are to be understood and appreciated in the contemplative process, as in the expression atthaveda and dhammaveda, or atthapatisamvedī dhammapatisamvedī.

2149 What follows is a stock passage leading up to the elaboration of the brief teaching by one of the bhikkhus, usually either Mahākaccāna or Ānanda.

2150 A Chinese parallel occurs in MĀ 188. The first part, T I 734a29-c24, roughly corresponds to 10:116, but it includes a block of text that mirrors MN 76.21, I 519,13-29, a satirical account of a certain teacher's claim to omniscience. A later part of the sutta, T I 734c25-735b25, is parallel to 10:115.

2151 Pandita. The word means "wise one, learned one." I am uncertain whether this was a proper name or a sobriquet.

2152 Cittaṭthānasatāni. Mp glosses with cittuppädasatāni. It seems to me that reading cinta- in place of citta- would be more appropriate to the context. One Burmese manuscript referred to in the notes to Ee does in fact have this reading.

2153 Pandito vata bho pandito vata bho. This refers back to the name of the ascetic sophist.

2154 These first three cases are common to $\mathrm{Ce}, \mathrm{Be}$, and Ee. Be ends here, but Ce adds two further paragraphs, and Ee one paragraph, unique to that edition.

2155 The two paragraphs in brackets are in Ce but not in Be or Ee. It seems to me to be foreign to the thought-world of the Nikāyas to pit two doctrines that accord with the Dhamma against one another in a contest aimed at refutation, and also incongruous for an "assembly that accords with the Dhamma" (dhammikā parisā) to be described as "loud and boisterous" (uccāsaddā mahāsaddā). Normally, this expression describes either an assembly of nonBuddhist wanderers (as in 10:93, V 185,14) or a group of unruly householders making a racket (as in 5:30, III 30,27). On one occasion it describes a group of bhikkhus (MN I 456,20-22), but they are promptly sent away by the Buddha.

In place of these two paragraphs in Ce, Ee has a paragraph that reads as follows: "Someone refutes and disproves a doctrine contrary to the Dhamma with a doctrine that accords with the Dhamma. In this way, [231] he delights an assembly that accords with the Dhamma. For this reason, the assembly that accords with the Dhamma becomes loud and boisterous, exclaiming: 'He is truly wise, sir! He is truly wise, sir!'" It is quite normal, even expected, for a doctrine that accords with the Dhamma to prevail over a doctrine contrary to the Dhamma, but again it seems incongruous for an assembly that accords with the Dhamma to become "loud and boisterous."

2156 These verses are also at Dhp 86-89.

2157 Te loke parinibbutā. This could also have been rendered, "They have attained nibbāna in the world."

2158 PED explains paccorohan $\bar{\imath}$ as "the ceremony of coming down again (?), approaching or descending to (acc.), esp. the holy fire." SED sv pratyavarohaṇa says: "A particular Gṛhya [householder] festival in the month Mārgaśirṣa" (November-December).

2159 Paccorohāma bhavantaṃ, paccorohāma bhavantaṃ. It is apparently from this salutation that the paccorohan $\bar{\imath}$ festival derives its name. SED explains the verb pratyavarchati to mean: "to descend (from a seat, chariot, etc.) in honor of (acc.)." Apparently, here
the brahmins are descending in honor of Agni, the god of fire, representing the all-pervasive energy of the universe.

2160 I follow Ce, which unlike Be and Ee, does not include dhammam in the sentence.

2161 I follow Be, which is consistent in putting the dark path before the bright path here and in 10:190. Ce and Ee put the bright path first here, but invert the sequence at 10:190. My title conforms to Be, whereas Ce has "The Bright Path" here but titles 10:190 "The Dark Path."

2162 This sutta and the following are parallels respectively of 10:119 and 10:120.

2163 This sutta and the next are parallels respectively of 10:117 and 10:118.

2164 There is parallelism between 10:171 and 10:113; 10:172 and 10:115; and 10:173 and 10:114.

2165 It was this Cunda that offered the Buddha his final meal. See DN 16.4.17-19, II 127.

2166 Soceyyāni. The meaning is not immediately clear and Mp does not gloss the word. Soceyya normally means "purity, purification," but from the context it seems to refer to a kind of rite.

2167 The last four refer respectively to: (1) a woman protected by her co-religionists, (2) one already married or even promised to a husband at birth or in childhood, (3) one with whom sexual relations entail punishment, and (4) a girl who has been garlanded by a man as a sign of engagement.

2168 All three editions here read bajjhantu, "let them be bound." Mp provides no gloss but at MN I 287,11 we find vajjhantu, glossed by Ps II 332,16 as vadham pāpunantu, "let them be slaughtered," and by Ps-pṭ II 230 (VRI ed.) as maranam pāpunantu, "let them die." I thus take vajjhantu to be the correct reading.

2169 Pāli: saddhāni; Skt śrāddhāni. SED sv śrāddha says: "A ceremony in honour and for the benefit of dead relatives observed with great strictness at various fixed periods and on occasions of rejoicing as well as mourning by the surviving relatives (these ceremonies are performed by the daily offering of water and on stated occasions by the offering of pindas or balls of rice and meal to three paternal and three maternal forefathers, i.e., to father, grandfather, and great grandfather; it should be borne in mind that a śrāddha is not a funeral ceremony but a supplement to such a ceremony; it is an act of reverential homage to a deceased person performed by relatives, and is moreover supposed to supply the dead with strengthening nutriment after the performance of the previous funeral ceremonies has endowed them with ethereal bodies; indeed, until those anteyesti or 'funeral rites' have been performed, and until the succeeding first śrāddha has been
celebrated the deceased relative is a preta or restless, wandering ghost, and has no real body ...; it is not until the first śrāddha has taken place that he attains a position among the pitrs or Divine Fathers in their blissful abode called Pitr-loka, and the śrāddha is most desirable and efficacious when performed by a son . . .)."

2170 It is presumably the passages on the ten unwholesome and wholesome courses of kamma that explain the inclusion of this sutta in the Tens.

2171 Ce anuppann $\bar{a}$ should be corrected to upapanna, the reading in Be and Ee and clearly required by the context.

2172 Afihānepi bhavamp gotamo parikappan vadati. Mp: "[By this] he asks: 'When it is the wrong occasion [for sharing the merit of giving], does Master Gotama proclaim the fruitfulness of giving to that relative?' For the brahmin held the belief that the donor does not gain any fruit of a gift given thus: But the Blessed One, having acknowledged his question, shows: 'The donor gains the fruit of his gift wherever he is reborn; in any place where he is sustained by his meritorious fruits.'".

2173 This chapter is parallel to the Third Fifty, Chapter IV; the next chapter, to the Third Fifty, Chapter V.

2174 This chapter is parallel to the Fourth Fifty, Chapter I.

2175 Ee merges these eleven suttas with the previous one, thus counting only one sutta in the chapter, whereas Ce and Be , which I follow, have twelve distinct suttas. Thus from this point my numbering differs significantly from Ee.

2176 Except for the abridgment I do not detect any difference between this sutta and the previous one. I have translated the text just as it is, additionally abridging only the descriptions of wrong view and right view. None of the editions says anything about this. Mp does not comment on the first five suttas in this vagga, stating that their meaning is clear.

2177 Samsappantyapariyāyaṃ vo bhikkhave dhammapariyāyaṃ desessāmi. Mp: "An exposition of the Dhamma that has 'creeping' as its subject matter."

2178 Mp: "In doing that action he creeps forward, creeps around, wriggles around."

2179 Ulūkā. The owl may have been included here because it operates furtively. The Chinese counterpart at T I 273c27-28 mentions only four animals: the snake, the mouse, the cat, and the fox.

2180 The text has the genitive plural sañcetanikānaṃ kammānaṃ. Out of deference to established English usage, I have used the singular "kamma." In view of the fact that kamma is by definition volitional (cetana 'haṃ bhikkhave kammam vadami), "volitional kamma" sounds redundant, but I follow the Pāli. Apparently the text is playing off two meanings of kamma, the literal meaning
of "deed, action" and the extended meaning of a deed with the capacity to produce ethically determined fruits. The former meaning, perhaps, is accentuated by kata, "done," the latter by upacita, "accumulated, stored up" as well as by the reference to the time periods when it can ripen.

2181 On the threefold ripening of kamma, see pp. 1639-40, note 372. The Buddha's statement that there is no termination of volitional kamına so long as one has not experienced its results seems to contradict one of the main premises of his teaching, namely, that to attain liberation-"to make an end of suffering"-one need not experience the results of all the kamma one has accumulated in the past. This tenet (at least according to the Nikāyas) was proposed by the Jains, as stated at MN 14.17, I 92,35-93,10; MN 101.10, II 218,1-12. However, since the cycle of rebirths is "without discoverable beginning" (anamatagga samsāra), and in this long stretch we have all accumulated an immensity of kamma, it would virtually require infinite time to exhaust such kamma by experiencing its results. The Buddha taught that the key to liberation was not the eradication of past kamma (whether by experiencing its results or by austerities) but the elimination of the defilements. Arahants, by terminating the defilements, extinguish the potential for ripening of all their past kamma beyond the residue that might ripen in their final life. Mp explains the text's statement as having an implicit meaning: "This is intended to show that as long as samsāra continues, if there is kamma that has acquired the capacity to ripen (patiladdhavipākārahakamma) 'there is no place on earth where one might escape an evil deed'" (the citation, na vijjati so jagatippadeso; yatthatṭhito mucceyya pāpakammā, is from Dhp 127). The point, in other words, is not that all kamma created will have to ripen, but that any kamma created and accumulated retains the potential to ripen as long as one wanders on in the cycle of rebirths.

A Chinese parallel of 10:219, MĀ 15 (T I 437b24-438b11), opens with a similar declaration as 10:217. The statement (at T I 437b2628) reads in translation: "If one has done a past kamma, I say that one must experience its result: one experiences it either in the present life or in a future life. But if one has not done a past kamma, I say that one will not experience its result" (若有故作業，我說彼必受其報，或現世受或後世受、若不故作業，我說此不必受報）。 The Chinese parallel offers only two alternatives for the time of ripening and lacks anything corresponding to the problematic assertion, "I do not say that there is making an end of suffering so long as one has not experienced [the results of] volitional kamma that has been done and accumulated."

2182 Kāyakammantasandosabyāpatti. Mp glosses as "a fault consisting
in bodily action" (kāyakammantasañkhatā vipatti). Apparently, Mp understands sandosa and byāpatti to convey the same meaning, glossed by vipatti, but I take the compound to be a dvanda: "corruption and failure."

2183 See p. 1672, note 582.

2184 Apparently this version differs from 10:217 only by abridging the expository sections and by omitting the simile of the dice.

2185 Although the text of the sutta (in the three editions) does not include a peyyala here, indicating an elision, it was probably right here that the sutta originally included the passage on the ten courses of kamma (as in the preceding two suttas). Only in this way would its inclusion in the Tens make sense. Further, the transition to sa kho so : . . ariyasāvako evàm vigatabhijjho vigatabyāpādo asammūlho in the next paragraph, with the reference to a definite subject, implies that it had been preceded by a passage that already spoke about the noble disciple. We find the full passage, in fact, in the Chinese parallel, MĀ 15, which is a synthesis of 10:217-18 and the present sutta.

The structure of MĀ 15 is as follows: Following the opening statement, the Buddha defines the ten kinds of unwholesome kamma of body, speech, and mind. He then says that an instructed noble disciple discards the threefold unwholesome types of kamma (bodily, verbal, and mental) and cultivates the threefold wholesome types. At this point "that instructed noble disciple" (彼多聞聖弟子), possessing such energy and virtue, has purified his kamma of body, speech, and mind. He is without anger and hostility, has dispelled drowsiness, eliminated restlessness and arrogance, abandoned doubt, and gone beyond conceit. He is mindful, possesses clear comprehension, and is unconfused. He then pervades the ten directions and the entire world with a mind of loving-kindness and the other three immeasurables.

2186 Yaṃ kho pana kiñci pamānakataṃ kammaṃ, na taṃ tatrāvasissati, na tam tatrāvatiṭthati. Mp identifies "measurable kamma" with sense-sphere kamma (kāmāvacarakamma), that is, kamma due to produce its results in the sense sphere. Since the disciple being described is presumably a non-returner (or one bound to become a non-returner), he or she will take rebirth in the form realm and never again descend to the sense sphere. Thus the sense-sphere kamma cannot find an opportunity to ripen.

2187 As pointed out earlier, the Pāli word kamma bears two senses often difficult to distinguish: the etymological sense, simply an action or deed, and the soteriological sense, a deed considered as a moral force that can bring retributive consequences. It is strange that the text says unequivocally that one who develops
the liberation of mind by loving-kindness can do no bad deed. It seems to me that although such a person might not commit bad deeds motivated by hatred and ill will, they could still do bad deeds, even minor ones, motivated by greed and delusion.

2188 This statement, too, seems counterintuitive. Those who do no bad deeds in this life certainly can suffer the kammic effects of bad deeds done in previous lives. Thus Moggallāna was assassinated and the Buddha himself was badly injured by a sharp stone that broke off from the boulder hurled at him by Devadatta. Virtuous people who are not arahants might also undergo psychological suffering, and not merely physical pain, as a consequence of undesirable situations. For example, Ānanda, a virtuous monk, felt grief and worry when the Buddha fell ill and Visākhā, a stream-enterer, lamented the death of her grandchild.

2189 Cittantaro ayam bhikkhave macco. Mp: "They have mind as their cause, or their interior is due to mind (cittakārano, atha vä citten'eva. antariko). For with the mind at rebirth that follows without interval the mind at death, one becomes a deva, a hell-being, or an animal."

2190 Karajakaya. I translate the expression literally but it may imply much the same thing as such English expressions as "this mortal body" or "this corporeal body." DOP sv kara, says: "A body produced by action, the physical body." SN 12:37, II 65,1, speaks of the body as "old kamma" (purānamidaṃ...kammam). The Chinese parallel has nothing that corresponds to this term.

2191 Mp: "By means of loving-kindness, the feeling that would have been experienced upon rebirth is cut off, and thus it does not follow one along. This is the reflection of a noble person who is a stream-enterer or a once-returner." Presumably, the bad kamma is all to be experienced here (sabbam tam idha vedantyam), in this life, and will not follow along (na tam anugam bhavissati) because his next rebirth will be in the form realm, where there is no painful experience, and he will attain nibbāna in the form realm without returning to this world.

2192 Idha paññassa bhikkhuno uttarim vimuttim appativijjhato. Mp: "A wise bhikkhu here: The wisdom in this teaching is called 'wisdom here.' The meaning [of a wise one here] is a noble disciple who is settled in the noble wisdom that pertains to the teaching" (imasmiṃ sāsane pañña idhapañña nāma, sāsanacaritāya ariyapaññāya thitassa ariyasāvakassā ti attho).

2193 Mp calls this the state of a "jhāna non-returner" (jhānānāgāmitā). Such persons have realized the lower two fruits and attained the jhānas, but have not yet really reached the stage of non-returner. By the karmic power of their jhānas they will be reborn in the
form realm, where they will attain the higher two paths and fruits without ever returning to the sense sphere; thus they are called "jhāna non-returners." The "further liberation" (uttarim vimutti) is arahantship. See too p. 1664, note 539.

2194 Ee combines these three suttas with the previous one.

2195 Neither Ce nor Ee numbers this vagga. Ce, however, numbers the suttas in this series as if the vagga were to be counted as 3 (thus beginning with 10.5.3.1, where the second figure indicates the number of the Fifties and the third the number of the vagga). Be numbers it 23, in accordance with the consecutive numbering scheme it uses for the vaggas. Since the "Extra Fifty" has only twenty-six suttas without this vagga, I have numbered it "III," on the assumption that it belongs in this set of Fifty.

2196 Ce numbers the suttas from 10.5.3.1 to 10.5.3.510. Be, using consecutive numbering for the entire nipāta, numbers them from 237 to 746 ; Ee numbers them from 217 to 219 , collecting all the elaborations into 219. I follow the system of Be.

2197 It seems peculiar for right knowledge and right liberation to be treated as conditions for direct knowledge, for (as denoting the knowledge and liberation of the arahant) they are normally themselves the results of direct knowledge.

2198 Here Ce and Ee additionally insert upasamäya ("for the pacification").

# Notes to the Elevens

2199 An expanded parallel of 10:1. It differs only by dividing the compound "disenchantment and dispassion" (nibbidāvirāga) into two.

2200 An expanded parallel of 10:2.

2201 An expanded parallel of 10:3.

2202 An expanded parallel of 10:88.

2203 Here, Ce and Ee have the singular verb, vodayati, as against Be's plural vodayanti. Ee states in a note that all manuscripts have vodayanti. See p. 1849, note 2108.

2204 An expanded parallel of 10:6, with an additional section in which Ānanda discusses the same state of concentration with Sāriputta and receives the same answer. Note that whereas, in the Tens, Sāriputta answers the question in a different way than the Buddha (but presumably referring to the same state of concentration), here his answer agrees with the Buddha's.

2205 Ee treats the passage from here to the end as a separate sutta, which it numbers 8 . Thus from this point on its numbering exceeds by one the numbering in Ce and Be , which take this
dialogue to belong to 11:7. The last sentence, applauding the agreement between the Buddha's explanation and Sāriputta's, confirms that both are parts of a single sutta. In contrast, 10:6 and 10:7, which are also dialogues on this samädhi respectively between Ānanda and the Buddha, and Ānanda and Sāriputta, have no bridge that unites them.

2206 Mp identifies the "foremost state" (aggapada) with nibbāna.

2207 By counting the sense faculties and their objects, this sutta includes more than eleven items. But to maintain the elevenfold scheme, I begin numbering the relevant items with "earth."

2208 Be has the name as Saddha.

2209 Jhāyati pajjhayati nijjhayati avajjhayati. As in 6:46, III 354,8-10, the tone is derisive.

2210 Yaśsa te näbhijānāma, yampi nissāya jhāyasi. See MN 22.36, I 140,1-7: "When the devas with Indra, Brahmā, and Pajāpati, search for a monk thus liberated in mind, they do not find that on which the consciousness of one who has thus attained is dependent. Why so?. I say that one who has thus attained is untraceable even in this very life" (evaṃ vimuttacittam kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhüm sa-indā devā sabrahmakā sapajāpatika anvesam nädhigacchanti 'idam nissitam tathāgatassa vī̄̄̄̄an' ti. Tam kissa hetu? Ditth'eväham; bhikkhave, dhamme tathāgataṃ ananuvijjo ti vadami).

2211 Paṭhaviyam paṭhavisañña vibhütā hoti. Mp glosses vibhüta here with "evident" (päkata), explaining: "The perceptions of the four or five jhānas arisen with earth, etc., as object are evident... because they have been seen with insight as impermanent, suffering, and non-self." Mp tries to support its interpretation with a citation it says is from a sutta: vibhüta, bhante, rūpasaññā avibhütā atṭhikasañña. However, a search through CST 4.0 fails to locate these words anywhere in the Nikāyas. To my knowledge, in the Nikāyas vibhüta always means "disappeared, vanished." See the expressions vibhütasaññi at Sn 874, and vibhütarüpasaññissa at Sn 1113, where in both cases vibhüta can only mean "disappeared." There seems no reason to ascribe a later meaning to it here. A Chinese parallel, SĀ 926 (at T II 235c26-236b11), supports this conclusion. Taking earth as an example (at II 236a27), it reads: "A bhikkhu is able to suppress the perception of earth in relation to the perception of earth" (比丘於地想能伏地想). Could the middle想 here be gratuitous so that we should read 比丘於地能伏地想?

2212 Mp: "He meditates by the attainment of fruition engendered by having passed in this way through the sequence of insights" (evaṃ vipassanāpaṭipātiya āgantvā uppāditäya phalasamāpattiya jhāyanto).

2213 This sutta combines into one 3:143-45, and adds an extra dyad
to obtain eleven items. It might thus be considered a composite eleven. The formula on the arahant is also in 7:61. Mp explains "ultimate conclusion" (accantantitho) thus: "The indestructible nibbāna is his conclusion; it is called 'ultimate' (accanta) because it surpasses the end (antam atitattā)."

2214 A part-parallel of 6:10.

2215 I translate this freely in accordance with natural English diction. More literally it would read: "Bhante, among the various ways in which we dwell, how should we dwell?"

2216 Brahmāli writes: "It is worth noting that a layperson speaks of entering upon the rains residence. Perhaps this was a common phenomenon in northern India, and not just restricted to samanas. Maybe it was generally too difficult to travel."

2217 Mp identifies the asamayavimutto with the arahant. In relation to the expression in 6:55, "does not see in himself anything still to be done or [any need] to increase what has been done" (asamayavimutto karaniyam attano na samanupassati katassa vā paticayam), Mp has glossed paticayam with "progress by repeatedly doing" (punappunam karaṇena vaḍdhim).

2218 Neither Ce nor Be use a $t i$ to signal the end of a direct quotation, and thus on their readings it is not easy to determine exactly where the meditation formula ends. Ee inserts $t i$ here, which signifies that the formula ends here and that it includes the simile and the repetition. The devas that subsist on edible food belong to the sense sphere. Those that have been reborn in a mind-made body belong to the form sphere. It is not clear why it is said that they "do not see in themselves anything still to be done or [any need] to increase what has been done" (tā karaniyam attano na samanupassanii katassa vā paticayam). This phrase is normally reserved for the arahant. I can only surmise that the text is alluding to those devas that have attained arahantship.

2219 I read with Be and Ee aggi mutto, as against Ce aggimukko.

2220 Saddhassa upāsakassa putto. This might have also been rendered "the son of the male lay follower Saddha," taking saddha to be a proper name. But in such a case I would expect nāma to have been included. Be reads sudattassa upāsakassa putto, "the son of the male lay follower Sudatta." Sudatta was the proper name of Anāthapindika, but Anāthapindika's children would surely have been well known to the Buddha and thus his inquiry about the monk's identity would be strange. Further, except under rare conditions, the Nikāyas do not refer to Anāthapindika by his personal name.

2221 Saddhāpadānesu. Mp: "In the manifestation, the characteristics, of
persons endowed with faith" (saddhānam puggalānam apadānesu lakkhanesu).

2222 An expanded parallel of 8:1. This is the version that is usually recited as a protective discourse.

2223 The eleven benefits are explained in detail at Vism 311-14, Ppn $9.59-76$.

2224 Identical with MN 52.

2225 The householder is described as gahapati aṭthakanāgara, where -nāgara means "a citizen of [such and such] a city." The word for city itself is nagara. This is analogous to calling a person from New York a New Yorker, one from Paris a Parisian, etc.

2226 Ten'eva dhammarāgena dhammanandiyā. As at 9:36; see p. 1827, note 1917. Mp: "What is meant by this pair of terms is desire and lust for serenity and insight. For if one is able to exhaust all desire and lust for serenity and insight, one becomes an arahant. If one cannot do so, one becomes a non-returner. Because one has not abandoned desire and lust for serenity and insight, through the volition of the fourth jhāna one is reborn in the pure abodes. This is the general explanation among the teachers."

2227 The base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception is not included because it is considered too subtle for its constituent factors to be used as objects of contemplation.

2228 The eleven "doors to the deathless" are the four jhānas, the four immeasurables, and the lower three formless attainments. They are used as bases to develop insight and attain arahantship.

2229 That is, five hundred kahāpanas.

2230 Identical with MN 33.

2231 At SN 47:6, V 148,1-2, the four establishments of mindfulness are called the pasture (gocara) of a bhikkhu, that is, the proper sphere of his attention.

2232 The dialogue here is identical with the first part of 11:7.

2233 Be does not include this series of suttas, perhaps assuming that it was implied by the preceding. Ee includes it only as three short sections within the larger sutta on the simile of the cowherd.

2234 Ee does not number this vagga. Both Ce and Be number it 4.

2235 Ce numbers the suttas in this vagga starting from 1 and ending at 170, Be numbers them in continuation with those in the entire nipāta. Since it did not include the positive version of the cowherd simile, Be begins with 502 and ends with 671 . I use both schemes but begin the absolute count with 982.

# Index of Subjects

This index lists significant references only. As long as the passage is pertinent, page references may be listed under an entry even when the term itself does not appear in the text. For example, a passage that speaks about the five factors included in the five hindrances is listed under "Hindrances," even though the expression "five hindrances" does not occur there. A passage that describes a bhikkhu in terms that clearly mark him as an arahant is listed under "Arahant," even though the text may not use the word "arahant." When a stock formulation is applied to each member in a set of categories, normally the reference is given only under the name of the set, not under its individual members; exceptions are made when these items are singled out for elaboration. When an entry includes two or more numerical subentries, these have been arranged in numerical rather than alphabetical order; other, non-numerical subentries follow the numerical ones in alphabetical order. For example, under "Powers," two, four, five, seven, and eight powers are listed in that order, followed by the powers of the arahant, the Tathāgata, and the trainee. Pāli equivalents are provided for all key doctrinal terms. The Pāli term is generally given in the singular, in the stem form, though the term occurring in the text may be in the plural and in an indirect case.
