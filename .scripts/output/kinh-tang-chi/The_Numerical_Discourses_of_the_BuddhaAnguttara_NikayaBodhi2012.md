###### Preface

 The present work offers a com plete translation of the Anguttara N ikaya, the fourth major collection in the Sutta Pitaka, or "Bas­ ket of D iscourses," belonging to the Pali Canon. An English translation of the Anguttara N ikaya published by the Pali Text Society has long been in print under the title The Book of the Gradual Sayings. It was issued in five volum es, I, II, and V trans­ lated by F. L. W oodw ard, and III and IV by E, M. Hare! First published between 1932 and 1936, this translation is now dated both in style and technical term inology, and thus a fresh English rendering of the entire work has long been a pressing need. In the late 1990s I collected.N yanaponika T hera's four-part series of W heel booklets, An Anguttara Nikaya Anthology, into a single volum e for the International Sacred Literature Trust. I added sixty suttas to the original anthology, and the resulting vol­ um e w as published as Numerical Discourses of the Buddha: An Anthology of Suttas from the Anguttara Nikaya (W alnut Creek, CA: A ltaM ira Press 1999). This com pilation, w ith a total of 208 sut­ tas, contained perhaps an eighth of the full A nguttara Nikaya. Translations of m any individual A n gu ttara suttas have also been available over the internet, but a selection, how ever valu­ able, cannot do service for a translation of the complete work. This translation, like m y previous renderings from the Pali Canon and com m entaries, aim s to fulfill tw o ideals that are to som e degree in tension with one another: first, to be faithful to the m eaning of the original; and second, to express this m ean­ ing in clear contem porary English. M y translation is based on three different editions of the Pali text. I used the Sinlvala-script Buddha Jayanti edition as m y root text, and I am grateful to Ven. Dham m ajlva Thera of M itiogala H issarana Vanaya for

 edition with the V ipassana Research Institute's electronic ver­ sion of the Burm ese-script Chattha Sangayana (Sixth C ouncil) edition and w ith the PTS's Rom an-script edition. I also con ­ sulted the variants noted in the PTS edition, which occasion­ ally, in m y view,, had a better reading than the printed editions. In defense of this "eclectic7' approach I appeal to Professor E. H ardy's w ords in his preface to part V of his PTS edition of the A nguttara N ikaya: "It m ay be open to dispute, W hether our Sinhalese M ss. [m anuscripts] of the Anguttara are the m ore reliable, or our Burm ese. . . . As a rule, there is no Ms. nor any set of Mss. w hich can be relied on indiscriminately" (p. v). The contents of the Anguttara Nikaya (AN) prove especially challenging to m odern readers because there is virtually no "rhyme or reason" to their order apart from their conform ity to the numericaJ schem e that governs each book. To help the reader make sense of the w ork, I prepared a thematic study guide to AN, which follows the introduction (see pp. 75-84). The guide lays out the principal them es of this collection in a .meaningful sequence, w hich is sim ilar to the one I used in my anthology In the Buddha's Words. On this basis I then classified the suttas (the great m ajority, though not all) according to the w ay they exemplify the schem e, I suggest that readers new to A N con­ sider reading the w ork twice. First, read the suttas in the order in which they fit into the thematic guide; then read the entire Nikaya again in the original order, from the Ones through the Elevens. The first reading will enable readers to grasp the m ain contours of the Buddha's teachings as they are represented by AN; the second will enable them to follow the work in its origi­ nal arrangem ent. M }' long introduction is primarily intended to explain AN using the them atic guide as a framework for m ak­ ing sense of the m ountain of material found in this collection. In the course of preparing this translation, I have had the generous help of several people whose contributions have been invaluable. First and forem ost is John Kelly, who offered his help even beforei I actually embarked on the project and unfail­ ingly assisted m e through the six years it has taken to bring the w ork to com pletion. A keen student of Pali since 2003, John read the translation alongside the Pali text at several stages, offering useful com m ents and\suggestions and occasionally catching

 files, entered the page numbers of the PTS edition into the files, compiled the tw o appendixes and index of proper names,, and checked page proofs. His article, '"The Buddha's Teachings to Lay People," w hich I cite several times in the introduction, is a bountiful source of inform ation that helps us better understand the place of the A iiguttara Nikaya in the corpus of Buddhist canonical literature. O ccasionally John's wife Lynn also offered suggestions. Another m ajor helper w as Bhikkhu Brahm ali of Bodhinyana M onastery in Serpentine, Australia. Ven. Brahm ali read the translation alongside the Pali text in two stages, offering inci­ sive com m ents. O ften his com m ents necessitated revisions in the draft or required m e to add explanatory note3 to clarify the reasons behind m y rendering. On a few occasions I have q u o ted . Ven. Brahm ali's com m ents in m y notes. Ven. V anarata A nahda Thera, a senior bhikkhu in Sri Lanka, checked m y translations of'the verse portions of A N . H e w rote extremely helpful com m ents into a printout of the m anuscript, which Bhikkhu N yanatusita kindly photographed and sent to me by em ail. I have occasionally included Ven. V anarata's remarks in the notes. Bhikkhu P asadiko, W illiam Pruitt, and Bhikkhu K hem a- ratana read v ariou s versions of the translation and offered useful suggestions and com m ents. Pam ela Kirby review ed the proofs, w ith sharp eyes for minor typographical and stylistic flaws. M y student Pohui Chang helped review the indexes and checked m y C hinese renderings in the notes. I m ust also thank Tim McNeill and the team at W isdom Pub­ lications for such a fine job of production, consistent w ith their treatm ent of the earlier volum es in this series. I reserve a special word of thanks to D avid Kittelstrom , M egan A n derson , and Laura C unningham for their work on the present volum e. I am grateful to all these helpers for their selfless assistance, offered entirely from their love of the Dhamrna. M ay they share in any m erits that m ight arise from the publication of this w ork. 1 myself, of course, take responsibility for any errors or faults that rem ain, Bhikkhu Bodhi C huang Yen M onastery

###### Introduction

 T h e A n g u t t a r a N i k a y a a s a C o l l e c t i o n

 The A nguttara Nikaya is the fourth of the four m ajor Nikayas m aking up the Sutta Pitaka of the Pali C anon , the collection of texts that Theravada Buddhists regard as buddhavacana or .'"w ord of the Buddha." The work is arran ged according to a pedagogical technique often em ployed by the Buddha, namely, the use of a num erical scheme as the underpinning of a dis­ course. In a period in Indian history w hen w riting m ight not have been know n,1 or in any case w as n ot u sed to record spiri­ tual teachings, memorization and preservation of the teachings required that they could be easily retained in m ind. The use of num bers served this purpose well. A nyone w ho has regularly given lectures knows how helpful it is to d raw up an outline that organizes the theme of the lecture into a num erical list. Precisely this is the principle that lies behind the suttas, or dis­ courses, of the A nguttara Nikaya. The w ord anguttara is a com pound that m ight be rendered "in creasin g-b y-a-faq tor." The com p ilation is occasionally referred to in the commentaries as the Ekuttaranikaya, "the col­ lection increasing by one," and also as the A nguttaragam a. This suggests that in the age of the com m entators, several w ays of designating the w ork were still in circulation. The correspond­ ing w ork in the N orthern Buddhist tradition is know n as the Ekottaragam a or Ekottarikagama, agama ("h eritage") being the w ord used in the Northern tradition in place of nikaya to des­ ignate the compilations of discourses. O ne full version of the Ekottaragam a in Chinese translation is included in the Chinese Tripitaka. The occasional use of the w ord agarna in the Pali com ­ m entaries to designate the discourse collections indicates that


-----

###### The name A nguttara is given to this collection because it is arranged according to a scheme in which the number of items in the suttas of each successive part increases increm entally over those of the preceding part. The collection contains eleven nipatas or "books" nam ed simply after their numerical basis: the Ekakanipata, the Book of the Ones; the Dukanipata, the Book of the Twos; and so forth up to the Ekfidasakanipata, the Book of the Elevens. From the Book of the Sixes upward we occasionally find that the num ber of items needed for a sutta to fit into the scheme is obtained.by combining smaller sets. The sum m ary verse (uddana) at the end of the last volum e states that the A nguttara Nikaya contains 9,557 suttas. An exact figure is hard to arrive at because it is uncertain w hether particular suttas are to be counted separately or as com posite wholes. The large figure probably results from counting sepa­ rately all the suttas generated by the "Lust and So Forth Repeti­ tion Series'7 found at the end of each nipata after the first (see below, pp. 62—63). A ccording to m y numbering schem e, A N contains a total of 8,122 suttas, of which 4,250 belong to the "Lust and So Forth Repetition Series." This means that there are only 3,872 suttas independent of that series. M any of these, however, occur in repetition sequences of their own, so even this figure is m isleading if it is taken to imply that the contents of the suttas are autonom ous. For example, the total num ber of suttas in the Fives, the Sevens, and the Elevens is greatly inflated by the inclusion in each of entire series of suttas derived from permutations. If these are bracketed, the number of inde­ pendent suttas w ould be m uch reduced. The following table shows the total num ber of suttas in each nipata and in the "L u st and So Forth Repetition Series." In each nipata, the suttas are gathered into vaggas, which m ay be called "chapters." The vaggas are constructed according to an ideal plan according to which they would each contain ten suttas, but— given that ideals are seldom realized in our w orld, even in Buddhist scriptures— in individual cases the actual number m ay vary from as m any as 262 down to a m inim um of seven. On occasion all, or most, of the suttas in a single vagga may relate to a single topic, indicated by the vagga's title, but this is rare. It is m uch m ore com m on for merely two or three suttas— and often only one— to bear a clear relation to the title.

###### There is no ap p aren t significance in the sequence of v ag g as, though w e m ight suppose that the redactors included in the first few vaggas of any book suttas they considered especially w eighty. A lthough on a first reading the apparently h ap h az­ ard organization of AJNT m ay be disconcerting, over tim e this becom es one of the m ost enjoyable features of the collection, exposing the know ledgeable reader to a constantly shifting su c­ cession of topics and ideas w ithout allowing preconceptions to determ ine w hat will com e next. All the reader can know for certain is that the successive suttas will conform to the num eri­ cal plan that governs the individual book (but som etim es even this is hard to detect). The suttas of the A nguttara Nikaya, it seems, w ere not origi­ nally given titles as w e understand the word. M odem editions, such as the Sri Lankan Buddha Jay anti and Burm ese C hattha Sangayana versions, d o title them, but these titles are the w ork of recent editors. The typical procedure was to include, at the


-----

###### end of each vagga, an uddana or sum m ary verse, w hich labels each sutta by a key w ord related to its subject m atter. I have drawn m y sutta titles from the uddanas, and they are therefore very short. Som e vagg as do not have sum m ary verses, and thus their suttas are untitled. This is especially the case w ith those that are extrem ely short, such as the suttas of the Ones and the Twos. While the four m ain N ikayas of the Sutta Pitaka are each highly variegated, close exam ination of their contents suggests that each has a dom inant purpose m conveying a particular aspect of the Buddha's m essage. This concern, I should stress, is by no means evident in every sutta in the respective collec­ tion but only pertains to the collection w hen viewed as a w hole. The Digha N ikaya is largely governed by the aim of propagat­ ing Buddhism within its cultural milieu. Its suttas attem pt to establish the su p rem acy of the. Buddha and his D ham m a over their com petitors on the Indian religious and social scene. Thus the first sutta of DN surveys the philosophical views that the Buddha flatly rejected, the second repudiates the teachings of six contem porary teachers, while m any of the following texts pit the Buddha in debate against brahmins and m em bers of other sects; other suttas serve the purpose of glorifying the Bud-, dha and dem onstrating his superiority to the gods, the nature spirits, and the ascetics and contem platives who traveled over the Ganges plain. The M ajjhima N ikaya, on the other hand, turns its spotlight inw ard on the Buddhist com m unity. M any of the suttas deal w ith the fundam entals of the doctrine and with m editation and other aspects of Buddhist practice. This makes it particularly w ell suited for the instruction of m onks who need to be integrated into the community. The Sam yutta N ikaya and Anguttara Nikaya consist m ostly, of short suttas and thus lack the scenarios and dram atic con­ frontations that m ake the tw o longer collections so fascinating. The Samyutta is gov erned by a them atic principle and contains m any short suttas disclosing the Buddha's radical insights and the topography of the path. This collection would have served the needs o£ tw o ty p e so f specialists in the monastic order. One w ere those m onks snd-nuns w ho w ere capable of grasping the deeper ram ifications of Buddhist w isdom and w ere therefore


-----

###### who had already fulfilled the preliminary stages of m editative training and w ere intent on developing insight and realizing the goal. With the m ove from the Sam yutta to the Anguttara N ikaya, a shift in em phasis takes place from comprehension to personal edification. Because the short suttas that explain the philosophi­ cal "theory" and the m ain m ethods of training found their way into the M ajjhima and the Samyutta, what rem ained to be incorporated into the Anguttara were short suttas w hose primary concern is practical. To some extent, in its practical orientation/the A nguttara partly overlaps the last book of the Samyutta, w hich contains chapters devoted to the seven groups that m ake up the thirty-seven "aids to enlightenm ent" (bodhipakkhiya dhamnia). To avoid unnecessary duplication, the redactors of the canon did not include these suttas again in the Anguttara under their numerical headings. The topics do appear in the repetition series at the end of each nipata, but here their role is stereotyped and secondary. The Anguttara focuses instead on aspects of practical training that are not com prised in the standard sets, thereby helping us understand the Buddhist training from new angles. Perhaps we might say that if the last part of the Sam yutta gives us an anatomy of the Buddhist path, the Anguttara takes a physiological slant on the path, view ing it by w ay of its dynam ic unfolding rather than by w ay of its constituents. It would be unrealistic, how ever, to insist that a single cri­ terion has governed the compilation of the Anguttara N ikaya, which includes m aterial from the Vinaya, lists of em inent dis­ ciples, cosm ological ideas, and odd registers of terms that defy easy categorization. W hat can be said with confidence is that a broad survey of its contents would show a preponderance of texts dealing w ith Buddhist practice. Their subjects range from the basic ethical observances recommended to the busy layperson, through the pillars of mind training, to the highest meditative state, the samadki or concentration ot the arahant.

 A p p r o a c h i n g t h e A n g u t t a r a

 Because the suttas of AN constantly shift from one topic to another with little to connect them apart .from the exemplification


-----

###### of a particular numerical schem e, readers of this Nikaya often come away bewildered. W hile they m ay profit from individual suttas, they can discern no w ay to fit them together into an intel­ ligible whole. The text itself is not particularly helpful in this respect, for it does not articulate a comprehensive framework that reveals the contours of its teachings. The Dlgha Nikaya and the Majjhima Nikaya, of course, are also arranged in an apparently haphazard manner, with little m ore than a simple theme governing each vagga or chapter. But because these collections are com posed of suttas that are either long or of middle length— as their respective titles indicate— their contents are substantial enough to engage the reader with material for reflection and contem plation. The major discourses in these Nikayas also show a sufficient degree of internal orga­ nization to reveal the chief categories into which the Buddha's discourses are cast: the courses of w holesom e and unwhole­ som e kamma, the graduated training, dependent origination, the four establishments of mindfulness, the four noble truths, and so forth. Though the Samyutta Nikaya contains mostly short suttas, the method of grouping connected texts dealing with a single theme makes fewer dem ands on the reader's patience than a collection with no intelligible organizational principle. W hen it comes to AN, how ever, a neophyte reader may feel as if he or she has been dropped off in a boat far out at sea, with no land in sight and without a com pass or map. I pick a chapter at random —the sixth vagga of the Book of the Fives— and I find the following: two suttas on the five hindrances (one embel­ lished with a simile, the other little m ore than an enumeration); a sutta on the five factors o f striving, followed by another on the five wrong and right occasions for striving; a sutta about the perils that separate mother and son; n ext/on e on the training of a monk; a discourse on five them es for reflection; next, one on the proper uses of wealth; and finally tw o brief suttas on the hardships of those who enter m onastic life in old age. With such apparently arbitrary organization, one cannot but wonder what the compilers had in mind w hen they assembled the chapter. To assist the reader, I have developed a thematic guide to the Anguttara Nikaya that organizes the contents of the col­ lection in accordance with a system atic pattern. The scheme, which follows the introduction on pages 75-84, is similar to the


-----

###### one I used as the scaffolding for m y anthology In the Buddha's V/ords. I do not assign every sutta in A N to a niche in this guide. Some suttas resist classification, w hile others are too short or insubstantial for inclusion. R ather than try to be all-inclusive, I have proposed a fram ew ork, w ith divisions and subdivisions, and included enough discourses under each heading to enable the reader to see how the texts of A N can be fit together into a meaningful pattern. Inevitably, the attem pt to assign particular suttas to specific categories involved abstraction and painful decision-making. Many suttas in AN can be view ed from different points of view, any of which could have resulted in a sutta being placed in different categories. For instance, the suttas often explain prac­ tices or qualities by w ay of the persons w ho exemplify them, or alternatively, they explain persons b y w ay of their practices and qualities, Thus I had to decide w hether the sutLa should be clas­ sified in terms of practices and qualities or in term s of persons. In some cases a given sutta covers a range of topics and thus fits comfortably into several categories. I did not want m y guide to turn into an index, w hich w ould lack the degree of specificity needed to heip the reader fit the sutta into the ground plan of the whole. Thus, while m y ideal w as "on e sutta, one category," I often had to assign a single sutta to tw o categories and some­ times to three. H ow ever, I do n ot think I have exceeded three places for a single sutta. The broadest categories that I used for the scheme are the "Three Jewels": the Buddha-, the D ham m a, and the Sangha. I begin with the section on the B uddha, honoring him as the founder of the Buddhist heritage and the ultimate source of all the teachings com prised in the A n guttara Nikaya. Section’ll, titled "The Dhamma and D iscipline," deals with the Buddha's teaching as a body of instructions that can be summ arized, applied, and realized, and also as a corpus of texts that need to be preserved and transm itted to posterity. Following this sec­ tion come eight sections devoted to the teachings themselves. This portion of the outline is intended to cover the Dhamma in its full range as we find it in A N . It begins w ith a survey of the Buddha's w orldview (section III), covering the cosmological background to the Buddhist liberation project, the piobiematic

###### destiny. I then proceed in stages through the different forms of Buddhist practice, beginning w ith life in the world: fam­ ily relations, livelihood, wealth, com m unity, and state (section IV). These spheres of hum an activity are often neglected by w riters on Buddhism, who succum b to the error of assuming that monastic practice represents the Dham ma in its entirety. The Anguttara is a treasury of inspiring and informative dis­ courses on righteous living in the confines of the world, and these texts are essential to arriving at an adequate picture of early Buddhism-. • While the Buddha stressed the virtues conducive to domestic harm ony, his teaching does not stop there but leads on to the . training for a higher rebirth arid ultim ate liberation. Though the form er of these two trainings w as directed toward lay disciples and the latter toward the bhikkhus and bhikkhunls, the .two . share many values. These Values constitute a common platform _ of spiritual cultivation for both lay disciples and monastics. Under this theme, ! have gathered into section V a variety of. texts that concentrate on the practices of the devoted lay dis­ ciple who is not content merely to observe an ethical life but also . seeks to advance along the path to liberation. The Anguttara Nikaya is a rich source of guidance for earnest lay followers, and this section attempts to do justice to such texts. ' To inspire in his followers an aspiration for the fmal goal, the Buddha highlights the defects and dangers of mundane exis­ tence, which illustrate the noble truth of suffering. Section VI therefore groups together a num ber of topics and texts devpted to the task of "dispelling the w orld's enchantm ent." What binds us to conditioned existence, with its round of repeated birth and death and the danger of descent to low er realms of rebirth, are the defilements of the mind. Suttas dealing with this topic play a very prominent role in A N , and tljiese have been gathered into section VTI. The next division, section VIII, groups together sut­ tas on the monastic training, w hich flows out from the spirit o f renunciation and aims at the attainm ent of nibbaha. The heart of the monastic training is the practice of meditation, which is given a section of its own,,section IX. H ere I have allocated sut­ tas that emphasize the practices that lead to the higher states of concentration (samadhi). Section X takes us into the next phase of the higher training, thgjde velopm ent of w isdom (paniia), cut-

It deals w ith both the institutional Sangha, the order of ordained m onks and nuns (bhikkhus and bhikkhunls), and the ariyasahgha, the com m unity of noble ones, those w ho have attained the paths and fruits of enlightenment. The last major section of the grou nd plan deals with types of persons. This is an area w here the A nguttara differs significantly from the Samyutta. The m ajor chapters of the Samyutta focus on the main philosophical them es of the teaching, the principles and categories that the Buddha proposed as templates for con­ tem plation and insight. Thus w e find in the Sam yutta huge chapters on dependent origination, the elem ents, the five aggre­ gates, the six sense bases, and the p ath factors, often explained in bare phenomenological term s w ith only minimal references to actual persons. The A nguttara, in contrast, abounds in dif­ ferent w ays of classifying people— both m onastics and lay- people, noble ones and ordinary people— and it gives primacy to their qualities, their struggles for happiness and meaning, their aspirations and attainm ents. The A nguttara thus became the inspiration and a m ajor source for one of the books of the Abhidham m a Pitaka, the Puggalapannatti or "Descriptions of Persons," the one treatise in the collection that departs from the strict Abhidhamma m ethod of phenom enological reduction in order to survey types of persons as they, relate to the values and goals of the Dhamma.

 In w hat follows I will explore the contents of A N through the m ajor categories of the Them atic G uide, highlighting promi­ nent themes that em erge in this N ikaya and citing suttas that exem plify them. At the risk of being repetitive, I have to assert once again that the assignm ent of individual suttas to particu­ lar categories is largely done for the sake of expediency and risks nullifying the com p lexity in the contents of particular texts.

###### find a substantial num ber of suttas devoted to the Buddha him ­ self, not m erely as the teacher and expounder of the D ham m a, but as a person w ith his ow n life story and achievem ents. I have distinguished the suttas that deal with the Buddha into three classes: those that refer to his life and thus constitute the building blocks of a biography; those that extol his spiritual qualities and attainm ents; and, as a distinct category, those that speak of the Buddha not so m uch as a unique individual but as an archetype, the exem plar of the fully enlightened teacher who embodies his m essage in his person. This last heading com ­ prises those suttas in w hich the Buddha speaks of himself as "the Tathagata." The N ikayas never sought to construct a continuous bio­ graphy of the Buddha. The suttas that refer to events in his life are widely spread out in the different collections and seldom provide the clues that w ould be needed to connect these into a single coherent sequence. The Mahaparinibbana Sutta (DN 16) gives us a connected account of the Buddha's last days, culminating in his death and cremation. But beyond this, the biographical m aterial has to be ferreted out from w idely scat­ tered texts, and w e m ust rely on speculation, imagination, and hints in the texts them selves (such as settings and occasional references to related incidents) to assign these to specific phases of the Buddha's life. Nevertheless, A N does allude to the incidents familiar to us from the connected accounts of his life that w ere com posed later. W e can see these perhaps as the raw material that the poets and haigiographers w ould draw upon to construct the glorious Buddha biography. Thus 4:127 speaks about the w on­ ders that accom panied his conception in the womb, his physical birth, his enlightenm ent, and his setting in motion the w heel of the Dhamma. In 3:39 he speaks about his delicate and luxurious upbringing, and he recounts the reflections on old age, illness, and death that roused him from his intoxication with youth, health, and life. H e discusses his efforts to master the various stages of m editation during his struggle for enlightenment in 8:64 and 9:40, tw o accounts that are not included in the famil­ iar Buddha biography. Sutta 5:196 tells of the five dream s that he had while still a bodhisatta, foretokens of his aw akening, and 8:11 relates the traditional account of the enlightenment as

 proceeding through the four jhanas and the three higher know l­ edges to the destruction of the taints. In 4:21 he tells of his reflec­ tions after his enlightenm ent and of his decision to honor only the Dhamma. In 8:70 he claim s that if he so wished, he could live out the eon, and he decides to "relinquish his life force" because Ananda failed to request him to extend his life. This incident is familiar to us from the M ahaparinibbana Sutta. While texts offering biographical information on the Bud­ dha are relatively sparse, those that extol his virtues and attain­ ments are plentiful. H e is praised as the "one person w ho arises in.the W o rld .. .o u t of com passion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and human beings" (1:170). His bodily form is endow ed w ith such extraordinary m arks that an inquisitive brahm in cannot believe he is a mere hum an being (4:36). He has perfected noble virtue, concentration, w isdom , and. liberation (4:1). H e possesses the qualities expected of a
 • fully'.accomplished spiritual teacher (5:100). H e is praised by the monk U dayl in verses of great beauty (6:43) and extolled by his lay disciple King Pasenadi (10:30). He dwells in the w orld detached from the w orld, w ith all defilements gone, free from birth, old age, and d eath , like a lotus flower that is "born in the water and grow n up in the w ater, but rises up above th e w ater and stands unsoiled by the w ater" (4:36,10:81). The suttas in w hich the Buddha speaks of him self as the "T ath agata" are sufficiently im pressive to w arran t being assigned to a class of their ow n. In these suttas I see the Bud­ dha referring to him self not simply as a unique individual but as the latest representative of the "dynasty" of Buddhas, those extraordinary beings w ho appear at rare intervals in the cosm ic process to rediscover the lost path to nibbana and teach it to the world. In A N , w e find explicit references to only tw o of the six Buddhas of the p ast that w e know from other N ikayas. Sikhi, the fifth back, is referred to at 3:80, and Kassapa, G otam a's p re­ decessor, at 5:180. But there are a fair number of references to Tathagatas in the plural, w hich indicates that the idea of a suc­ cession of Buddhas w as already known to the com pilers. From the p ersp ective of the N ikayas, all the T ath agatas p ar­ take of the sam e essential attributes that qualify them to serve as world teachers. The T athagata is declared to be "w ith o u t a

His arising is "the m anifestation of great vision, light, and radiance" (1:175-77). He has fully awakened to "whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, and exam ined by the m ind," and therefore whatever he teaches "is just so and not other­ w ise" (4:23). He is endowed with the "ten Tathagata pow ers" and the "four.kinds of self-confidence" on the basis of which "he claims the place of the chief bull, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the brahma w heel" (4:8,10:22; see too 6:64). His "lion's roar" on im perm anence is so pow ­ erful that it even causes the long-lived deities to quake and tremble (4:33).

 T h e -D h a m m a a n d t h e D i s c ip l i n e

 Although the Buddha is the supreme person in the spiritual realm , he still revered something superior to himself: the Dhamma. After his enlightenment, seeking in vain for some­ one to honor, he decided: "Let me honor, respect, and dwell in dependence only on this Dhamma to which I have become fully enlightened" (4:22). When he teaches, others, he does so "relying just on the Dhamma, honoring, respecting, and ven­ erating the Dhamma, taking the Dham m a as his standard, banner, and authority" (3:14, 5:133). W hom ever he teaches, he teaches respectfully, "because the Tathagata has respect for the Dham m a, reverence for the Dhamma" (5:99). The D ham m a in this sense is not so m uch the verbally expressed doctrine as the corpus of spiritual principles that makes possible spiritual growth and liberation. Its ultimate referents are the noble eightfold path, the forem ost of all con­ ditioned phenomena, and nibbana, the foremost of all things conditioned and unconditioned (4:34). The Buddha summ ed up the essence of the Dhamma in various w ays that all flow out of the same body of principles. In one place, he says that the unlim ited expressions of the Dhamma converge on four things: understanding what is unwholesome and abandoning it, and understanding what is wholesome and developing it (4:188). He taught Mahapajapati, his foster m other, eight cri-

###### teria of the true Dhamma (8:53), and m ore concisely he told the bhikkhu Upali that the teaching could be found in "those things that lead exclusively to disenchantm ent, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to nibbana" (7:83). C ontrary to m any of his contemporaries, the Buddha refused to indulge in speculative views about m atters irrelevant to the quest for release from suffering. He particularly refused to make pronouncem ents about the fate of the liberated one after death or to answ er the ten idle speculative questions (see 7:54). Instead, he stressed that he taught the D ham m a "for the purifi­ cation of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing aw ay of pain and dejection, for the achievement of the m ethod, for the realization of nibbana" (9:20). Yet, though he m aintained a kind of "metaphysical reticence," he did not hesitate to criticize those views he considered detrim ental to the spiritual life. The texts sometimes m ention three that he expressly repudiated: past-action determ inism , deterministic theism, and denial of causality (3:61). H e decidedly rejects as a w rong view the thesis that "there is no fruit or result of good and bad actions," which disavows the principle of kam m a (10:176, 10:211, etc.). H e also strongly criticized the "h ard determ inist" view that our decisions are irrevocably caused by factors and forces outside ourselves. Against the determ inist position that "there is no kam m a, no deed, no energy," he says that all the perfectly enlightened Buddhas teach "a doctrine of kamma, a doctrine of deeds, a doctrine of energy" (3:137). He insisted that there are such things as instigation, initiative, choice, and. exertion, by reason of which people are responsible for their own destiny (6:38). The Buddha claimed that his Dham m a w as "directly visible" (sanditthika), a w ord that became one of its epithets. W hen ques­ tioned how this was to be confirmed, he explained in ways that directed the inquirers back to their own im m ediate experience. W hen a person is overwhelmed by lust, hatred, and delusion, he said, he acts for his own harm, the harm of others, and the harm of both, and he experiences suffering and dejection; but w hen lust, hatred, and delusion are abandoned, he is free to act for the well-being of all and no longer experiences suffer­ ing and grief (see 3:53-54). The destruction of lust, hatred, and

###### delusion is nibbana, and in this respect nibbana too is directly visible (3:55). In A N , the Dhamma is viewed not m erely as the path of practice and the goal of realization but also as the collection of verbal discourses that the Buddha gave during his teaching career. Thus the suttas occasionally refer to the nine types of teaching into which the discourses were classified in the earliest period, before they were compiled into N ikayas (4:102, 4:107, 5:73—74, etc.). Because the Buddha's teachings, w hich disclose the path to enlightenment and liberation, w ere collected into a body of scriptures, the vigor, purity, and longevity of the D ham m a depend on the proper preservation and transmission of the texts. Am ong the four Nikayas, A N is the one that insiists m ost often on the need to properly preserve the D ham m a and thereby protect it from decay and disappearance. Suttas that dwell on this theme are found throughout the. work. A series of short texts in the Ones delineates the factors that cause the good Dhamma to vanish and, conversely, the fac­ tors that sustain its vitality (1:30-69). The latter can be sum m ed up as not confusing what is the Dhamma with w hat is not the D ham m a; not confusing the discipline with w hat is contrary to the discipline; quoting the Buddha accurately, describing his condxict correctly, and not confounding different categories of disciplinary rules. In one sutta, the Buddha gives instructions to. the m onks on the criteria for determining w hether teach­ ings reported after his passing are authentic or spurious (4:180). A nother sutta says that the good Dhamma degenerates when the monks do not preserve the teachings properly, m isinterpret their m eaning, fail to teach others, and backslide in the practice. But w hen, to the contrary, they preserve the teachings properly, interpret them correctly, teach others, and strive in the practice, the teaching lasts long (4:160). "I

 Given the im portance of preserving the teaching and ensur­ ing its longevity, w hat exactly is the content of the D ham m a that the Buddha discovered, and why is it so special? Before answ ering this question, it is.useful to briefly review the Bud­ dha's picture of the universe in order to see the background


-----

###### setting for the quest for Liberation. The N ikayas envision a uni­ verse of inconceivably vast dimensions undergoing alternating phases of developm ent and decline. The basic unit of cosmic time is the eon (kappa). Those who acquire the pow er of recall­ ing their past lives, the texts say, can recollect “m any eons of world-dissolution, many eons of w orld-evolution, m any eons of w orld-dissolution and world-evolution" (3:58, 3:101, etc.). The eon is divided into four phases: dissolving, prolonged dis­ solution, evolving, and completed evolution. Each of these is beyond calculation in hundreds of thousands of years (4:156). A w orld system has not only vast tem poral duration but is also stratified by w ay of various realms of existence, ranging from the dism al hell realms, worlds of intense suffering, through the anim al realm, to the sphere of afflicted spirits (som etim es called "hungry ghosts"); then on to the hum an realm , and upw ard through ah ascending series of celestial realm s inhabited by the devas and brahmas, the deities and divine beings. There are six sensual heavenly realms: the heaven of the four divine kings, the Tavatim sa devas, the Yama devas, the Tusita devas, the devas w ho delight in creation, and the devas w ho control what is created by others (3:70/6:10, 8:36, etc.). A bove these are the brahm a w orld and still higher realms, spheres of rebirth for those w ho have mastered the meditative attainm ents. Despite their m any differences, there is one thing that unites all sentient beings from the lowest to the highest: they all seek freedom from, suffering and the achievem ent of true happiness. This inherent urge of a seniient being is precisely w hat the Bud­ dha m akes the commanding theme of his teaching, the linch­ pin holding all the doctrines and practices together. But rather than take our com m on assumptions for granted, the Buddha embarks on a critical inquiry into the question of w hat consti­ tutes suffering and w hat offers the prospect for indissoluble happiness. O ur preconceptions about w hat will m ake us happy are often deceptive, stemming from a fixation on im m ediate sensation that excludes recognition of the deeper repercussions and long-term consequences of our behavior. Experience is ever changing, always shifting its shape without regard for our wishes and expectations. Despite our hopes, we cannot avoid old age, illness, and death, the decay of our pos­ sessions, the loss of those who are dear. The foolish worldling


-----

###### an d  the wise disciple both share this fate. They differ in that the worldling does not reflect on the universality of this law, and therefore, when his fate catches up with him, "he sorrows, languishes, laments, w eeps beating his breast, and becomes confused." The wise disciple, in contrast, realizes that old age, illness, and death, destruction and loss, are our universal des­ tiny; he thus draw s out "the poisonous dart of sorrow " and dwells happily, free of darts (5:48). Again, both worldling and disciple are subject to the "eight worldly conditions": gain and loss, disrepute and fame, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain. The worldling, attracted to one and repelled by the other, "is not freed from birth, from old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish." But the noble dis­ ciple, recognizing that all these unstable conditions are imper­ manent and subject to change, discards attraction and repulsion and achieves inner freedom (8:6). W hat the Buddha em phasizes as a starting point in the quest for true happiness is the close correlation between the ethical quality of our conduct and the felt tone of our experi­ ence. Bodily deeds, speech, and thoughts can be distinguished ethically into two broad classes, the unwholesome (akusald) and the wholesome (kusala). The Buddha noted that the unwhole­ some is a source of m isery, the wholesome a source of blessed­ ness. Greed, hatred, and delusion lead to harm and suffering, while their rem oval brings well-being and happiness (3:65— 66). His constant injunction to his disciples, therefore, w as to make a determined effort to abandon the unwholesome and to develop* the w holesom e (2:19). Wholesome endeavor brings a far greater, richer, and m ore enduring happiness than the indulgence of craving. A series of very short suttas contrasts different kinds of happiness and assesses their relative worth: the happiness of m onastic life is superior to that of lay life; the happiness of renunciation Superior to sensual happiness; the happiness w ithout acquisitions superior to the happiness arisen from acquisitions; the happiness without taints superior to that with taints; and spiritual happiness superior to worldly happiness (2:64—68). According to the Buddha, the "ever-shifting kaleidoscope" of suffering and happiness does not change its configurations only in a single life on earth; it changes even more radically as we

###### travel onward in the round of rebirths known as samsara, “the wandering." The governing factor in this process, which makes the entire course of rebirth a lawful one, is a force called kamma (Skt: karma). The w ord kamma literally means "action," but the Buddha uses it to refer specifically to volitional or intentional action: "It is volition, bhikkhus, that I call kamma; for having willed, one acts by body, speech, or mind" (6:63 §5). K am m a thus denotes deeds that originate from volition, w hich m ay remain purely m ental, creating kamma through our thoughts, plans, and desires; or it m ay com e to expression in bodily and verbal deeds. K am m a also denotes the moral force created by our deeds. All our m orally determinate deeds create a potential to bring forth results (vipaka) that correspond to their ethical quality. O ur deeds generate kamma, and when suitable condi­ tions come together, the kam m a ripens and produces the appro­ priate fruits, bringing m isery or happiness in dependence on the.moral quality of the original action. The kamma we create may ripen in this very life, in the next rebirth, or on som e sub­ sequent occasion (3:34, 10:217). The one thing that is certain is that as long as w e travel on in the cycle of rebirths, our stockpile of kamma is capable of ripening and yielding its due results. Thus the Buddha teaches, again and again, that "beings are the owners of their kam m a, the heirs of their kamma; they have kamma as their origin, kam m a as their relative, kam m a as their resort; whatever kam m a they do, good or bad, they are its heirs'" (10:216; see too 5:57,10:48). The differences in kam m a account for the wide diversity in the fortunes of people, w ho are constantly revolving in the cycle of existence, rising and falling, sometimes heading from dark­ ness to light, som etim es from light to darkness (4:85). Kam m a is the principal determ inant of rebirth. Unwholesome kam m a conduces to an unfortunate rebirth and painful results, w hole­ some kamma to a fortunate rebirth and pleasant results (2:16-17, 3:111,10:217-18). Rebirth is not confined to the hum an realm , for kamma varies in its quality and potency and thus m ay p ro­ duce rebirth in any of the five gatis or destinations: hell, the animal realm, the realm of afflicted spirits, the hum an w orld, or the deva w orld (6:63 §5). Beings are constantly m igrating from realm to realm, but relatively few are reborn in the hum an or deva worlds com pared to the m uch greater num ber w ho are

 reborn in the hells, the animal realm, and the spirit realms, col­ lectively called the plane of misery, the bad destinations, or the lower world (1:348—77). Modernists who propose interpreting these realms as psychological states that we experience in our human existence w ould have a hard time finding support for their position in the Nikayas. In AN we read again and again, in almost every nipata, of how beings are reborn in hell or in heaven "w ith the breakup of. the body, after death" (kayassa bheda parammarana). The expression is one of the main leitmotifs of the Nikayas, and there are no indications that it is intended metaphorically. The criterion for judging the volition responsible for an action to be unwholesom e or wholesome is its accompanying m otives or "roots." Three roots are unwholesome: greed, hatred, and delusion. From these such secondary defilements as anger, hos­ tility, envy, m iserliness, conceit, and arrogance arise> and from the roots and secondary defilements arise defiled actions w ith their potential to jproduce rebirth in the plane of m isery (6:39). W holesome.kamma, on the other hand, is action that originates from the three w holesom e roots: non-greed, non-hatred, and non-delusion, w hich m ay be expressed more positively as gener­ osity, loving-kindness, and wisdom. Whereas actions springing from the unw holesom e roots are necessarily tied to the round of repeated birth and death, actions born from the w holesom e roots are of two kinds, m undane and world-transcending. M un­ dane wholesome actions have the potential to produce a fortu­ nate rebirth in the higher realms (6:39). The world-transcending or supram undane (lokuttara) wholesome actions— namely, the kamma generated by practicing the noble eightfold path and the seven factors of enlightenment— dismantles the entire pro­ cess of karmic causation and thereby leads to liberation from the round of rebirths (3:34^4:233, 4:237-38). The texts Ho not leave us guessing what kinds of deeds cre­ ate wholesome and unwholesome kamma but provide precise maps over the terrain of right and wrong conduct. The stan­ dard list contains ten kinds of unwholesome action— three of body, four orspeech , and three of mind— and ten correspond^ ing types of w holesom e kamma (10:167-233; see 10:176 for a: detailed analysis). All these actions, however, ultimately spring

###### of good and evil and, through the actions that flow from it, the fundamental cause of suffering and happiness. By tracing the roots of suffering and happiness back to our intentions, the Buddha demonstrates that the key to happiness is the training and m astery o f the mind. In a series of paired suttas, he says that he sees nothing that leads to such harm and suffering as the mind that is undeveloped, uncultivated, untamed, unguarded, unprotected, and unrestrained; while nothing leads to such great good and happiness as the mind that is developed, cultivated, tamed, guarded, protected, and restrained (1:23-40). Thus the core of the Buddha's, teaching is the developm ent and cultivation of the mind, which, as a result of such cultivation, will unfold its intrinsic luminosity a n d ultim ately arrive at the bliss of liberation.

 M a i n t a i n i n g a H a r m o n i o u s H o u s e h o l d

 Although early Buddhism prescribes a path of self-cultivation leading to the extinction of suffering, the Buddha realized that spiritual developm ent does not occur in a social vacuum but rests up on a healthy and harmonious social order that exem pli­ fies the kinds of virtues that nurture the spiritual life. Spiritual influences begin at the top of the social hierarchy and gradu­ ally spread dow nw ard, affecting the whole society and even the biological and physical domains (4:70). Thus the Buddha devotes considerable effort to instilling in his followers the lifestyle and sense of social responsibility that conduces to a harmonious society in which people act in accordance with the civic virtues. Am ong the four Nikayas, the Anguttara—-along with the Slgalaka Sutta (DN 31)—-is probably the richest source of such teachings. John Kelly notes that this Nikaya has the larg­ est number of suttas concerned with laypeople, either directly, by being addressed to them, or indirectly, by being, spoken to the monks about the practices proper for a lay disciple. (See table 2.) From the num ber of discourses on family relationships, it is evident that the Buddha regarded the family as the prim ary agent of acculturation. Since the head of the family has a p ar­ ticularly powerful im pact on his household, the Buddha tried to promote the positive transformation of society by offering

In offering guidance to the family, the Buddha lays down the duties of children toward their parents (2:33,3:31), advises hus­ bands and wives how to live together (4:53), and even instructs a loving couple how they can be assured of reuniting in future lives (4:55). He distinguishes between, wrong livelihood and right livelihood, defines the proper w ays of acquiring and uti­ lizing wealth, and.prescribes the appropriate means for sustain­ ing cordial relationships: giving, endearing speech, beneficent conduct, and impartiality (4:32). He not only instructed indi­ viduals and families, but he als6 advised states and rulers. He taught the people of the Vajji confederacy, who maintained a republican form of governm ent, "seven principles of non­ decline" (7:21). For kings he set up the ideal of the "wheel- turning monarch" (raja cakkavati), the righteous king who rules by the Dhamma and provides righteous protection for all in his realm, including the animals and the birds (3:14, 5:133).

 While early Buddhism sees a righteous society as providing the optimal conditions for collective well-being and happiness, its focus is not on social stability as such but on the spiritual devel­ opment and liberation of the individual. The m ost congenial conditions for the unhindered pursuit of the final goal, are pro­ vided by the lifestyle of a renunciant m onk or nun, who is free from the constraints and liabilities of household life.. But,.almost unprecedented for his time, the Buddha also held that house­ holders earning their living by. "the sw eat of their arms7' and supporting a family could also advance spiritually and reach three of the four stages of aw akening (see pp. 55-56 below). He thus laid down guideposts to spiritual cultivation for his lay followers that would be com patible w ith their time-consuming schedules of work and fam ily responsibilities. These Would enable the lay disciple to w in a higher rebirth and even reach the plane of the noble ones, w here final liberation is assured. Many of the factors that enter into the foundational stage of spiritual development are com m on to the renunciant and the householder. Thus, though the suttas often describe these quali­ ties in terms of a bhikkhu, they can be understood to pertain to lay disciples as well. The seed of spiritual development is a triad of qualities consisting of faith (saddha)., confidence (pasada), and reverence (garava). Faith is a faculty and a pow er, and as such is defined as belief in the enlightenm ent of the Buddha (5:2,5:14). It is a deep trust in bis w isdom and a readiness to comply with his advice. From faith arise the other four powers that inspire and.direct the training: m oral sham e, m oral dread, energy, and wisdom. Closely connected w ith faith is confidence, a feeling of serenity and mental clarity that arises from faith. The dis­ ciple has confidence that the Buddha is the best of beings, the Dhamma the best of teachings, and the Sangha of noble ones the best of spiritual communities (4:34). Along w ith faith and confi­ dence comes reverence, a sense of respect and esteem directed toward the Three Jewels and the training (6:32—33). For a disciple endow ed w ith faith, spiritual growth is fur­ thered by associating w ith good friends, people who can give guidance and serve as inspiring models. The Buddha's

###### statement to Ananda (SN 45:2) that good friendship is the whole of the spiritual life finds powerful analogues in AN. We read that there is "no single thing that so causes unarisen whole­ some qualities to arise and arisen unwholesome qualities to decline as good friendship" (1:71). A pair of suttas beautifully enumerates the traits to be sought for in a good friend (7:36-37), and a discourse to a householder advises him to befriend other householders accomplished in faith, virtuous behavior, gener­ osity, and wisdom (8:54 §3). A large part of the practice for a- householder involves engag­ ing in meritorious deeds, activities that generate wholesome kamma conducive to a happy rebirth, good fortune, and spiri­ tual progress. The Buddha even urges the bhikkhus, "Do not be afraid of m erit/' and he details the benefits he reaped in a previous life by cultivating a mind of loving-kindness (7:62). . The-texts enumerate three "bases of meritorious activity": giv­ ing, virtuous behavior, and m editative development (8:36). They also mention four "stream s of m erit" for a noble disciple: unwavering confidence in the Three Jewels together with vir­ tuous behavior (4:52). The list is expanded to eight streams of merit by combining the Three Refuges with the five precepts (8:39). Many short texts in AN are concerned with the etiquette of giving and generosity, with the em phasis on providing mate­ rial support to monks and nuns as well as other ascetics who live in dependence on the lay com m unity. Though the Bud­ dha encouraged his disciples to support renunciants of all con­ victions, even his rivals (8:12), he also taught that the merit gained by giving is proportional to the spiritual qualities of the recipients, and thus the noble persons, especially arahants, serve as the most fertile field of m erit (3:57). Virtuous behavior begins by observing the five graining rules: abstinence from taking life, stealing, sexual m isconduct, false speech, and use of intoxicants. The code of good conduct can be expanded into the ten courses, of wholesome action, which cover not only bodily and verbal behavior but wholesom e dispositions and correct views (10:176). A number of texts give specific directives on right speech. I already referred to right livelihood in the previ­ ous section. Of particular value for the earnest lay devotee intent on merit

 is the uposatha observance adopted on new-m oon and full-moon days. On these occasions devout lay. followers undertake eight precepts that emulate the precepts of a novice monk (3:70,8:41— 45). They may spend the day practicing meditation, and one text recommends loving-kindness as especially suitable for the uposatha (9:18). Another text recom m ends five recollections, called means of cleansing the defiled m ind (3:70).4 The Buddha explains that observing the uposatha com plete in its eight fac­ tors is more beneficial than sovereignty over the continent, for the merit acquired can lead to rebirth in the heavenly worlds. In an interesting table reproduced here, Kelly has calculated the prevailing aims across N ikayas in the discourses addressed to laypeople. He distinguishes betw een aims concerned with m undane welfare— in this life and a heavenly rebirth— and those connected with the attainm ent of liberation:5.

###### Kelly notes that AN has a m uch stronger emphasis than the other Nikayas on the two m undane goals as against the attain­ ment of stream-entry or higher stages on the path. However, even in AN the practice for a lay follower is not exhausted by merit. In several suttas the Buddha m entions four qualities that lead to the superior welfare of a lay follower./The first three are faith, virtue, and generosity, the constituents of merit. But the fourth is wisdom, specifically "the w isdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to

 To steer his disciples aw ay from their attachm ent to transient objects of clinging, the Buddha employs an arsenal of tech­ niques intended to uncover the abyss that lies just beneath the apparently innocent joys of a virtuous life. These techniques are intended to instill in the aspirant a.quality called samvega, a word w ithout a precise English equivalent. To convey the sense it is necessary to resort to a makeshift phrase like "a sense of urgency '' Samvega m ight bie described as the inner com m otion or shock w e experience when w e.are jolted out of our usual com placency by a stark encounter with truths w hose full grav­ ity we norm ally refuse to face. Samvega- arises from the recog­ nition that our self-assum ed security is illusory, that w e are perpetually treading on thin ice, which at any m om ent m ay crack beneath our feet. . The chief catalyst in inducing this sense of urgency is our con­ frontation w ith our inevitable mortality as revealed by old age, illness, and death. This encounter shakes us out of our habitu­ ation to m undane comforts and sets us in quest of unshakable peace and freedom . The future Buddha himself had to undergo this "shock of recognition" before he could embark on his own quest for enlightenment. His deep reflections on old age, illness, and death shattered his infatuation w ith.youth, health, and vitality arid drove him from his palace out into the forest seek­ ing the unaging, illness-free, and deathless nibbana (3:39). In m any suttas, the Buddha employs a tem plate involving three standpoints designed to induce the sense of urgency. These three standpoints are gratification (assada), danger (adinava), and escape (:nissarana).6 W e begin with what is im m ediately obvi­ ous: that our (experience in the world provides som e degree of gratification or enjoyment, which consists in the pleasure and joy that arise with the fulfillment of our desires. It is because people experience gratification that they become attached to the things that give them pleasure. When, however, w e look m ore deeply, we can see that just beneath the glittering surface of joy there is a


-----

###### dark underbelly of pain and distress. This is their danger, stem ­ ming from their impermanence (anicca), liability to suffering (dukkha), and nature to change and decay (viparinamadhamma). The third step, escape, shows us the release from danger. When we see that our craving for pleasure binds us to w hat is inher­ ently flawed, we can drop the craving. Thus the escape lies in "the rem oval and abandoning of desire and lust." It is for the purpose of provoking a sense of urgency that the Buddha stresses aspects of experience that we typically try to conceal from ourselves. These points of em phasis give the teaching a "pessim istic" flavor, but it is a pessim ism that does not lead to the blind alley of nihilism but to the open fields of liberation, the end of suffering. In accordance w ith this strat­ egy, the Buddha teaches his disciples, whether m onastics or laypeople, to often reflect on the fact that they are subject to old age, illness, and death; that they must be parted from every­ one and everything they love; and that they are the heirs of their ow n kam m a (5:57). He underscores the m isery in sensual pleasures, calling them perilous, suffering, a disease, a boil, a tie, and a sw am p (6:23; see too 8:56). He declares that even a trifling am ount of conditioned existence, "even for a m ere fin­ ger snap," is like a lump of feces (1:328). He calls attention to the foulness of the body, which contains thirty-one unattractive constituents, is prey to a host of diseases, and resembles a boil with nine orifices (10:60 §§3-4; 9:15). He stresses the transience of hum an life, which is short, limited, and fleeting, beset by suffering and m isery (7:74). He points out that at som e point in the future even this great earth with its m ighty m ountains will burn up and vanish (7:66). Even more, he says, the entire w orld system will dissolve along with its pow erful deities. Understanding this, the wise disciple "becom es disenchanted and dispassionate tow ard the foremost, not to speak of w hat is inferior" (10:29 §§2-3).

 Once w e clearly recognize the defects in sensual pleasures and the futility of meandering from life to life in the realm s of con­ ditioned existence, the urge arises to break free from bondage and reach the end of repeated becoming, which is also the end

###### 42 The Anguttara Nikaya

 of suffering- To fulfill this urge, we have to investigate the cause of our bondage, for it is only by removing the cause that we can eliminate the result. The Buddha locates the cause of suffering in the bonds of our own minds. Hence the stress in the teaching on honest self-assessment (10:51). As part of a diagnosis of the origin of suffering, the Nikayas are replete with catalogues of the various defilements to which the mind is prey. In AN we find m any such groups, which are usually given m etaphorical names to indicate how they affect us: taints, hindrances, floods, fetters,, and so forth. W hen reading the Nikayas, we are likely to be aw ed by the wTide range of the defilements that are listed, and also to be confused about the distinctive roles played by the different groupings. To make sense of these lists, I have sorted them into three categories. The categories are of m y ow n devising and are not mentioned as.such either in the canonical texts or the commentaries. However, though the groups should.not be thought of as rigidly exclusive, the classification seem s to stand up to examin ation. (1) The first class are the defilements responsible for flawed behavior. These are the underlying motives of m isconduct and unwholesome kamma. The most important of such groups are the three unwholesome roots: greed (or lust), hatred, and delu­ sion, referred to above in the discussion of kam m a. They are often m entioned as the causes of bodily, verbal, and mental m isconduct, and they are also explicitly aligned w ith the ten courses of unwholesom e action (10:174). The three roots are sometimes expanded to "four wrong courses" (4:17—20)— desire, hatred, delusion, and fear— when motives for biased decisions are taken up for consideration. Sexual desire is a defilement of crucial concern to m onas­ tics, who are com m itted to>a life of celibacy and thus need to curb and m aster their sexual urges. The Buddha often speaks about the dangers in sensual pleasures and cautions the monks about forming close bonds with members of the opposite sex (5:225-26). In a monastic community that brings together peo­ ple w ith sharply, differing personalities and strong opinions, anger and resentm ent can also have a corrosive effect on group dynamics, and thus the Buddha and his chief disciples prescribe


-----

###### Introduction 43

 10:79-80). A nger and hostility jointly form the first of six "roots of dispute," which the Buddha saw as a danger to the harm ony of the Sangha (6:36). Since monastics are in principle taught to share their gains— whether material things, lay supporters, or know ledge— the Buddha enumerated five kinds of miserliness that m ust be uprooted to ensure that everyone in the com m u­ nity gets to fulfill their potential (5:115, 5:224). Laypeople, too, are instructed to dwell at home "w ith a m ind devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in relinquishment, devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing" (6:10). (2) The second class of defilements in this threefold scheme are those that impede the success of meditation. The m ost elemen­ tary in-this group is the simplest: sheer laziness, resistance to the w ork of "arousing energy for the attainm ent of the as-yet- unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized" (8:80). Once a medita­ tor overcom es laziness and makes the endeavor to m editate, the defilements he or she is likely to encounter fall into a set known as the1 five hindrances, so called because they are "obstructions, hindrances, encumbrances of the m ind, states that w eaken wis­ d om ." They even prevent one from knowing one's own good and the good-of others (5:51). The Buddha condem ns them as "a com plete heap of the unwholesom e" (5:52) and com pares them to corruptions of gold (5:23) and im purities in a bowl of w ater (5:193). A series of suttas at the beginning of A N explains the principal triggers for each of the five hindrances and the m ost effective contem plative techniques for subduing them (1 :11 - 20 ). The A n gu ttara mentions other sets of defilem ents that obstruct m editation practice. These include the three kinds of unwholesom e thoughts (4:11), the five kinds of m ental barren­ ness (5:205),. and the five mental bondages (5:206). These can m ore or less be correlated with the five hindrances. All these defilements are overcom e, tentatively, through the successful practice of serenity meditation, w hich reaches fulfillment in samadhi, m ental collectedness or concentration. (3) The defilements of the third type are the deepest and the m ost obstinate. These arc the defilements lodged at the base of


-----

###### rebirths. Such defilements lie dormant in the mind even when the meditator achieves exalted states of concentration. They can be removed only by the development of wisdom, by insight that penetrates deep into the truth of the Dhamma. In the language of the Pali com m entaries, they are totally eradicated only by the "supramundane" or world-transcending paths (lokuttaramagga), States of consciousness that break through the barriers of condi­ tioned reality and penetrate the unconditioned nibbana. The most prim ordial of these fundamental defilements are called the asavas, inadequately translated as "taints." These consist of craving for sensual pleasures, craving for continued- existence, and ignorance (6:63 §4). They are fully eradicated only with the attainm ent of arahantship, and thus the fruit of arahantship is described as "the taintless liberation of mind, lib­ eration by w isdom achieved with the (destruction of the taints." Other groups of fundamental defilements include the four bonds (4:10)/ identical in content w ith the three asavas but augm ented by the bond of view s;7 the seven underlying tendencies (7 :li— 12); and the ten fetters, w hose eradication in clusters marks the attainment of the successive stages of awakening (10:13). The three unwholesom e roots— lust, hatred, and delusion— also operate at this level and thus must be uprooted to gain libera­ tion* these defilements fall under the dominion of ignorance and craving for existence, which drive the process of sam sara . forward, from one existence to the next (3:76-77). Final libera­ tion therefore ultimately depends on eliminating ignorance and craving, which occurs through the world-transcendent wisdom th(at deeply discerns the four noble truths.

 T h e P a t h o f R e n u n c i a t i o n

 Although the Buddha taught the Dhamma openly and broadly to both renunciants and laypeople, he gave special attention to those who followed him from the household life into hom eless- ness to pursue the goal that he himself had realized. Thus the full range of D ham m a practice is incorporated into the system ­ atic training of the bhikkhu or bhikkhunl. The graduated course of monastic training is treated in greatest detail in the Digha and Majjhima N ikayas, but the same sequence also appears once in AN (4:198).


-----

###### The precondition for the training is the arising of the Tathagata and his proclam ation of the Dhamma. Having heard the teach­ ing, the student acquires faith and goes forth into the homeless life. Now a bhikkhu, he undertakes the ethical discipline of a renunciant, which requires a life of harmlessness and purity in bodily and verbal action. He should be content with the sim­ plest requisites, yet w ithout priding himself on his austerity (4:28). To facilitate the passage to concentration, he practices restraint of the sense faculties and exercises mindfulness and clear comprehension in all activities. Other texts on the m onas­ tic training mention tw o other measures that fit into this phase: moderation in eating and wakefulness (3:16,4:37). The bhikkhu resorts to a secluded dwelling place, cleanses his mind of the five hindrances, and m asters the four jhanas, the stages of deep concentration. He then directs the concentrated mind tow ard the three kinds of higher knowledge: the recollection of past lives, perception of the passing aw ay and rebirth of beings, and the penetration of the four noble truths. This process reaches consummation in the liberation of the mind from the asavas. Another sutta, 10:99, begins with the same series of prepara­ tory steps, but from the attainm ent of the four jhanas it pro­ ceeds to the four form less m editative attainments: the base of the infinity of space, the base of the infinity of consciousness, the base of nothingness, and the base of neither-perception-nor- non- perception. From there the meditator continues to the "ces­ sation of perception and feeling"— also known as the attainment of cessation— on em erging from which he "sees with w isdom " and attains the; (destruction of the asavas. In this version of the training, the first tw o higher knowledges are hot mentioned, and the process of m ental developm ent is continued through all nine meditative attainm ents. Yet, despite this difference, both conclude with the destruction of the asavas. Though AN shares this com prehensive description of the monastic training w ith other Nikayas, it includes formulations that seem to be specific, if not entirely unique, to itself. O ne such is the threefold training: the higher virtuous behavior, the higher mind (of concentration), and the higher wisdom (3 :8 1 - 90). Of particular interest in this series of texts is a pair of suttas stating that a monk can fall into offenses regarding the lesser and minor training rules, undergo rehabilitation, and attain the


-----

###### 46 The Anguttara Nikaya

 four stages of awakening (3:86-87). What he upholds firmly are "'those training rules that are fundamental to the spiritual life, in conformity with the spiritual life." These two suttas also cor­ relate the threefold training with the four stages of awakening: the stream-enterer and once-returner fulfill virtuous behavior but not the other two trainings, the non-returner fulfills virtue and concentration but not wisdom, and the arahant fulfills all three trainings. Another perspective on the sequential course of practice is .offered by a series, of "expanded parallels" that begins in the . Fives (with 5:24) and continues with augmentation into later nipatas as far as the Elevens. This series can be stratified in terms o£ the threefold training and its culmination in liberation, but it exhibits the finer transitional stages that lie between the main stages. Thus in the most complete version (11:3), it proceeds from virtuous behavior to non-regret, thence in steps to joy, rapture, tranquility, pleasure, concentration, knowledge and vision of things as they really are, disenchantment, dispassion, and the knowledge and vision of liberation. Presumably, libera­ tion itself should be w edged in after dispassion, but this would require a Book of Twelves. The monastic quest does not always culminate in the nir- vanic realization that inspired the monk to embark on the life of■■renunciation. The Nikayas show a keen awareness of human weakness and thus ring precautionary alarms. One sutta.men­ tions four "perils" that face a,clansman who has "gone forth out of faith from the household, life into homelessness": anger at being instructed by younger monks, craving for food that is frustrated by the regulations governing meals, attraction to the five kinds of sensual pleasure, and the encounter with seduc­ tive women (4:122). Another discourse says that any bhikkhu or bhikkhunl who gives up th£ training and reverts to lay life does so because of insufficient faith, moral shame, moral dread, energy, and wisdom (5:5). And two long discourses compare the bhikkhu w ho is deflected from the training to a w arrior defeated in battle. In one case the cause is "a woman or a girl who is beautiful, attractive, graceful/possessing supremebeauty of complexion" (5:75). In the oth erit is the passion that arises from seeing wom^n on alms round "with their dress in disar­ ray and loosely attired" (5:76). The Anguttara shows that while


-----

###### the Buddha had deep trust in the capacity of human beings to triumph over all bonds and fetters, he was not oblivious to the difficulty of the endeavor or to the strength and cunning of the defilements that have to be confronted and vanquished.

 M e d i t a t i o n

 The heart of the m onastic, life is the practice of what w e call meditation, the m ethodical effort to tame and master the mind and to develop its cap acity for calm and insight. The.training begins with the undeveloped mind, clouded and unruly, beset by passions and defilem ents. It ends in the liberated mind, tran­ quil, tamed, bright and lum inous, freed from defilements and bondage to repeated existence. Methods of m ental cultivation fall into two categories, seren­ ity (samatha) and insight (vipassana); the form er is considered the means to develop concentration, the latter the means to develop wisdom. Serenity brings the tentative abandoning of lust and results in liberation of m ind. Insight brings the abandoning of ignorance and results in liberation by wisdom (2:31). Jointly, "liberation of m ind" and "liberation by wisdom " constitute arahantship, the final goal. Although the usual sequence of meditative training proceeds from concentration to w isdom , several suttas in AN show that meditators can choose various routes to reach the w orld- transcending path. The disciple Ananda states that all those who attain arahantship do so in one of four ways: either by develop­ ing serenity first and then insight (the standard sequence), by developing insight first and then serenity, by developing the two in conjunction, and by emerging from "restlessness about the D ham m a" and achieving a unified mind (4:170). Another sutta advises one w ho gains either serenity or insight (but not the other) to seek out a teacher who can give instructions on obtaining the m issing factor; one who gains neither should seek instructions on gaining both; while one who gains both should develop them to capacity to reach the destruction of the asavas (4:94). The subjects of m editation mentioned in AN are m any and diverse. Like the other N ikayas, AN does not give detailed instructions on the technology of meditation, but it introduces


-----

###### a wide variety of meditation subjects. Apparently these had to be diverse to accommodate the different dispositions of the people who came to the Buddha for instruction. The Book of the Ones includes a virtual ''catalogue" of themes and attain-
 - ments pertaining to meditation practice, all set forth in connec­ tion with what makes a bhikkhu w orthy to receive almsfood (1:394-575). The same nipata concludes with an extended paean to mindfulness of the body {1:575—627), declared to be the key to realizing the deathless. Suttas in AN describe many of the familiar meditation sub­ jects that receive more detailed treatm ent in such works as the Visuddhimagg.a. We find here mindfulness of breathing (10:60 §10), the six devotional recollections (6:10,6:25), loving-kindness (8:1,11:15) along with all four immeasurables or "divine abodes" (3:65, 8:63), and mindfulness of death (6:19-20, 8:73-74). Walk­ ing meditation is praised for bringing five benefits (5:29). Of particular interest is the emphasis AN places on the "percep­ tions" (safina), meditation subjects that initially involve a fair amount of reflection rather than bare mindful observation. AN ^:49, for instance, mentions seven perceptions, which are said to "culminate in the deathless, to have the deathless as their consummation." The seven are the perception of unattractive- ' ness, the perception of death, the perception of the repulsive­ ness of food, the perception of non-delight in the entire world, the perception of .impermanence, the perception of suffering in the impermanent, and the perception of non-self in what is suffering. Each of these perceptions is then connected to a spe­ cific distorted perception or inclination that it counteracts. Thus the perception of unattractiveness eliminates desire for sexual intercourse, the perception of death counters attachment to life, the perception of the repulsiveness of food causes the mind to shrink away from craving for tastes. The popular Girimananda Sutta describes ten perceptions, which the Buddha instructs Ananda to recite in order to restore the health of the bhikkhu Girimananda, who was afflicted with a grave illness (10:60). Some of the meditation subjects mentioned in AN pertain, in traditional Theravada exegesis, to the development of seren­ ity, others to the development of insight. What is interesting in AN, however, is that while serenity and insight are treated as distinct domains of meditation w ith their own points of


-----

###### emphasis and fruits, a hard and fast line is not drawn between meditation subjects as pertaining to the one or the other. It is quite conceivable that in the Buddha's ow n view of meditation, serenity and insight represent not two separate categories of m editation objects but two com plem entary subjective orien­ tations that can be developed on the basis of the same set of meditation objects. In AN the higher states of consciousness achieved through meditation are often mentioned. The m ost frequent, of course, are the four jhanas. In addition w e also com e across such sets as the eight bases of overcom ing (8:65), the eight emancipa­ tions (8:66), and the nine progressive abidings (9:31-61). Suc­ cess in meditation is som etim es show n to culminate in the three true knowledges, the tevijja (3:58-59), which the Buddha himself attained on the night of his enlightenm ent (8:11). Else­ where meditation brings attainm ent of the six kinds of superior knowledge later known as the abhinnas (3:101-2, 5:23,6:2). Five of these involve psychic pow ers, w hile the sixth is the world- transcending knowledge of the destruction of the asavas.

 W is d o m

 Whein pursued as an end in itself, deep concentration is accom­ panied by exalted joy, bliss, calm , and equanimity. These expe­ riences can convince the unw ary m editator that he has reached the final goal and discovered "the nirvanic peace w ithin/' Such lofty states, however, are achieved sim ply through the inten­ sification of consciousness, not through the deep insight that cuts off the bonds of repeated existence. The superior states of concentration generate pow erful w holesom e kamma, which can lead to rebirth in the form or form less realm— the realms of super-divine stature— depending on the attainments reached during the meditator's hum an existence. W ithout the deep dis­ cernm ent of wisdom, this kam m a will eventually be exhausted, and the divine being will pass aw ay and take rebirth elsewhere, perhaps even in the bad destinations (3:116, 4:123—26). For the path to reach completion and culm inate in the deathless, it m ust eventually bring forth w isdom . Thus the Buddha praises wisdom as the foremost splendor, radiance, light, luster, and


-----

###### Despite the analogy with light, how ever, wisdom does not flare up suddenly and spontaneously through pious good wishes; rather, it is gradually begotten by following a pre­ scribed course of training. One sutta enumerates eight condi­ tions for acquiring and maturing the wisdom that pertains to the spiritual life (8:2). These include relying on a teacher, ask­ ing questions to clear away one's doubts, observing the rules of discipline, learning and reflection, and contemplating the arising and vanishing of the five aggregates. Another support­ ing factor for the growth of w isdom is right view. The Buddha assigned right view to the first place am ong the factors of the noble eightfold path and the ten kinds of rightness (10:103). From right view originate the other nine factors, ending in right knowledge and right liberation (10:105). Learning and investigating the Dham m a also contribute to the growth of wisdom. Among the four Nikayas, it is perhaps A N that places the greatest emphasis on learning. Learning is described as one of the five kinds of wealth (5:47) and as a qual­ ity that makes a bhikkhu respected and esteemed by his fellow monks (5:87). Of course, a disciple who has learned just a little but puts what he or she has learned into practice is superior to one who learns much without applying it (4:6). But learning does possess intrinsic value, and those who excel in learning and also obtain the four jhanas and the three true knowledges are regarded as especially worthy of respect (10:97). Mastery over the Dhamma qualifies one to teach, so that one can not only expedite one's own progress but also promote the good of others (8:62). The suttas of AN do not merely praise learning but provide concrete instructions on hovJ to learn and teach the Dhamma. Since the Dhamma was always conveyed orally, not in writ­ ten documents, the texts emphasize the need for both attentive listening and retention. One who does not attend closely is like an inverted bowl, which cannot hold w ater; one who attends but does not retain what has been learned is like a man who upsets the contents of his lap; while the one who both attends to discourses and retains what has been learned preserves it for a long time, just as an upright bowl long retains water (3:30). Ananda, the most learned of the bhikkhus, mentions six factors conducive to mastery of the Dham m a, among them learning

###### many discourses, teaching others, and visiting elders to clear up points one does not fully understand (6:51). Listening to the Dhamma can serve as an occasion for entering the irreversible path to final liberation, but to gain this benefit one has to listen properly. This m eans that one has to listen with a respectful and open mind, not w ith a m ind intent on finding faults and disparaging the discourse and the speaker (5:151-53). Listening and teaching can even precipitate the attainment of liberation. While listening to the D ham m a, teaching it, reciting it, or examining its meaning, one m ay gain, inspiration, experi­ ence joy, and set in motion a process that ends in full liberation from the asavas (5:28). Learning, how ever, should be accom pa­ nied by practice. Thus the Buddha urges the monks not to spend all their time on study, teaching/ recitation, and reflection but to go apart and devote themselves to the developm ent of internal serenity and experiential w isdom (5:73-74). Learning and teaching play a vital role in ensuring the longevity of the Dhamma. The D ham m a declines and disap­ pears, says one sutta, when the bhikkhus do not respectfully listen to it, learn it, retain it in m ind, exam ine the meaning,, and put it into practice; it continues w ithout degeneration w hen the bhikkhus are devoted to learning, reflection, and practice (5:154). Other suttas stress the im portance of teaching and making others recite the texts (5:155). W hen teaching, one has to select the appropriate topic,'assessing the interests and expectations of the audience, and then give a talk that matches their inclinations (5:157). The Bud dhajpr escribes five guidelines for a teacher of the Dhamma: he should give a talk that follows a progressive sequence; he should provide reasons to support his assertions; he should have em pathy w ith his audience; he should not be intent on m aterial gain; and he should hot say anything harmful to himself or others (5:159). Penetrative wisdom is not a m atter of m erely mastering a body of texts or a system of ideas but of seeing into the true nature of phenomena. The principles to be seen with wisdom are the ''three characteristics" of im perm anence, suffering, and non-self. W e are told that w hether Tathagatas arise in the world or not, this fixed law remains: that all conditioned phenomena are impermanent; that all conditioned phenom ena are suffer­


-----

###### To see the true nature of phenomena thus means to see them as im perm anent, suffering, and non-self. N orm ally, our minds are subject to perceptual and conceptual distortion, so that we construe things as being permanent, pleasurable, and self. H ow ever obvious these notions seem to us, the texts describe them as an inversion of perception and as forms of cognitive derangem ent (4:49). The task of insight is to correct this distor­ tion by contem plating things "as they really are," that is, as im perm anent, suffering, and non-self (7:16-18). Interestingly, several suttas in A N add a fourth theme of contem plation: con­ templating nibbana as happiness (6:101, 7:19). Contem plation of conditioned phenom ena as im perm a­ nent and suffering, contemplation of all phenom ena as non­ self, and contem plation of nibbana as happiness enable the disciple to acquire "a conviction in conform ity" w ith the D ham m a (anulomika khanti). This prepares the m ind for still deeper insight, and when that insight becomes aligned with the Dham m a itself, it induces entry upon "the fixed course of rightness" (sammattaniyama), the world-transcending path that leads unfailingly to the four stages of awakening (6:98-101). The Buddha insisted that the ultimate goal of his teaching w as the extinction of suffering in this very life, and for this reason he constantly urged the bhikkhus not to rem ain satisfied with any partial achievement but to press on tow ard the final goal. He enjoined them to resolve: "I will not relax m y energy so long as I have not attained what can be attained by manly strength, energy, and exertion" (2:5). Two suttas in AN give us an inside glimpse of the contemplative process by which the disciple realizes the final goal. One discourse explains that a bhikkhu enters any of the four jhanas or low er three form­ less attainm ents and contemplates its constituents— the five aggregates com prised in the attainment (four aggregates in the formless attainments)— as impermanent, suffering, an illness, a boil, a dart, misery, affliction, alien, disintegrating, em pty, and non-self. At a certain point he turns his mind aw ay from those phenom ena and directs it to the deathless element,, nibbana. On this basis he attains either the destruction of the asavas, that is., arahantship, or if he cannot complete the w ork, the stage of non-returner (9:36). The other sutta is spoken by Ananda to a lay devotee who has asked how a bhikkhu reaches the destruc­

###### tion of the taints. Ananda explains that the bhikkhu enters any of the four jhanas, the four immeasurables (loving-kindness, com passion, altruistic joy, and equanimity), or the three lower formless attainments. He then reviews the attainm ent as "con­ structed and produced by volition/' and observes: "W hatever is constructed and produced by volition is im perm anent, subject to cessation." In this case, too, he attains either arahantship or non-returning (11:16).

 T h e S a n g h a

 A ccording to traditional exegesis, the w ord sangha is used in two senses: as a designation for the m onastic order consisting of bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, sometimes called the "institutional Sangha" or "conventional Sangha" (sammutisangha), and as a designation for the "com munity of noble.ones" (ariyasangha), w hich consists of the eight types of noble persons, the four pairs of those who have attained the w orld-transcending paths and fruits. On the basis of this distinction it is then said that the conventional Sangha consists only of m onastics, whether noble ones or ordinary people, while the noble Sangha is said to include laypeople w ho have attained the paths and fruits as well as m onastics. In AN a distinction betw een these two kinds of Sangha is discernible, but the boundaries betw een them are not as clear-cut as tradition m akes them out to be. First, w henever new converts to the D ham m a declare that they go for refuge, they state the third object of refuge to be the "Sangha of bhikkhus" (presumably also including bhikkhunls). This show s that they (or, more likely, the com pilers of the texts) understood the m onastic com m unity to be the third refuge. Second, the formula for the noble Sangha describes it in terms that apply m ore readily to renunciants than to householders: it is "w orth y of gifts, w orthy of hospitality, w orthy of offerings, w orthy of reverential salutation." Such an encom ium again establishes a connection between the m onastic Sangha and the noble Sangha. H ow ever, one sutta speaks of "four kinds of persons w ho adorn the Sangha." These are w7ell-disciplined and learned bhikkhus, bhikkhunls, male lay followers, and female lay fol­ lowers (4:7; see too. 4:211). This suggests that the w ord sangha

###### 54 The Anguttara Nikaya

 even in the conventional sense can include laypeople, unless one understands the statement to mean that bhikkhus and bhikkhunls adorn the Sangha as its members while laypeople adorn it as its supporters. In any case, almost everyw here else when the texts speak about the Sangha without specific refer­ ence to the noble ones, the monastic order (or subgroups within it) is intended. Several A N suttas show that the monastic Sangha did not always m easure up to the criteria the Buddha had set for it. In 2:42-51 a series of contrasts is drawn between pairs of assem ­ blies, one censurable, the other laudable. The two assemblies are specifically described in terms of bhikkhus. The censur­ able arm of each pair includes the shallow assembly, in which the bhikkhus are "restless, puffed up, and vain"; the inferior assembly, in w hich they are luxurious and lax; the dregs of an assembly, in which they enter a wrong course on account of desire, hatred, delusion, or fear; and the assembly that val­ ues worldly things, not the good Dhamma. Heedlessness and wOrldliness w ere not the only problems that the Buddha had to deal with in the monastic order. Scattered throughout AN are references to quarrels and disputes among the bhikkhus. Thus we read about situations when the bhikkhus had taken to "arguing and quarreling and fell into a dispute, stabbing each other with piercing w ords" (10:50; see too 2:43,3:124). On some occasions the threat of schism cast its shadow. To forestall this danger, the Buddha proposed six guidelines to prom ote cordial relationships am ong the bhikkhus (6:12), and he urged them to assemble often and conduct the affairs of the Sangha in har­ mony (7:23). He also cautioned them about six roots of disputes that had to be extirpated whenever they arose (6:36). Yet despite the faults of its members, the Buddha had high regard for the monastic Sangha. He praised the Sangha of diligent bhikkhus as an unsurpassed field of merit worth traveling many miles to see (4:190), and he was pleased when he saw monks living "in concord, harm oniously, without disputes, blending like milk and w ater, view ing each other with eyes of affection" (10:50). The m onastic Sangha not only provided optimal conditions for those intent oh leading the spiritual life in full earnest­ ness, but it also served as a field of blessings and a channel

###### Introduction 55

 Bhikkhus and bhikkhunls offered laypeople the opportunity to gain m erit by supporting them with robes, alm sfood, dwellings, and m edicine. The monastics also used their encounters with laypeople as opportunities to teach the D ham m a to the people in the hom es, villages, and towns that they visited. H ence the Buddha laid Strong emphasis on the need for both partners in this sym biotic relationship to fulfill their respective duties. The m onastics are obliged to provide an inspiring m odel of disci­ plined conduct to the laity, behaving in such a w ay that "those without-confidence gain confidence and those w ith confidence increase in their confidence" (8:54; see too 4:245 §1). The lay com m unity is responsible for seeing to the m aterial needs of the m onastics. In doing so, they are expected to act w ith proper etiquette, saluting the monastic disciples respectfully, offering them a Seat, giving generously, and showing solicitude for their well-being (7:13). The lay devotees should also sit close by to listen to the D ham m a and savor the flavor of the w ords (9:17). The noble Sangha consists of eight types of noble persons, w ho are joined into four pairs in relation to the four stages of awakening. The two members of each pair are the one w ho has attained the stage itself and the one who has entered the path leading irreversibly tow ard that stage. They are stated concisely thus: "The stream -enterer, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of stream -entry; the once-returner, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of once-returning; the non-returner, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of non-returning; the arahant, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of arah an tsh ip " (8:59). In one sutta another term is ad d ed to the list of eight, the gotrabhu or "clan m em ber" (9:10; see too 10:16). Strangely, the relationship of this figure to the others is not explained in the Nikayas. The com m entaries interpret this term through the lens of the later Theravadin exegetical system , according to which gotrabhu refers to the single m ind- m om ent that makes the transition from the peak of insight to the w orld-transcending path. But this explanation presupposes the developm ent of technical schemes not discernible in the N ikayas, and it is therefore unlikely to represent the term 's original m eaning. The four m ain stages are distinguished by the fetters that


-----

###### who attain them (see 3:86, 4:210). With the destruction of the three lower fetters (see 10:13), the disciple becomes a stream- enterer (sotapanna), no longer subject to rebirth in the three lower realms and bound to reach liberation in a maximum of seven more lives, passed either in the human realm or in the deva world. W ith the destruction of three fetters and the addi­ tional diminishing of greed, hatred, and delusion, one becomes a once-returner {sakadagami), who comes back to this w orld one more time and then makes an end of suffering: W ith the destruction of all five lower fetters, the disciple becomes a non- returner {anagami), who takes spontaneous rebirth in the form realm (usually in a special region called the pure abodes) and attains final nibbana there without returning from that world. And with the com plete destruction of the taints, the disciple becomes an arahant, a fully liberated one.8 Though the explanations in the texts are often phrased in terms of bhikkhus, laypeople are also able to attain the first. three fruits and even the fourth. In the last case> how;ever, tra­ dition says that they either attain arahantship on the verge of death or almost at once leave the household life for homeless­ ness. We find in A N the testimony of several lay non-returners. Thus the layw om an NandamatS insinuates that she is a non- returner (at 7:53), as do Ugga of Vesali and Ugga of Hatthigama (at 8:21 and 8:22, respectively). The Sixes (6:119-39) mention a large number of male lay followers who have " reached cer­ tainty about the Tathagata and become seers of the deathless," a phrase that implies that they are noble disciples (but not ara- hants). Many female lay followers are elsewhere confirmed as winners of the noble fruits. Another m ethod of distinguishing the noble ones into seven types is mentioned at 7:14, where they are simply listed w ithout explanation; explanations are found in MN 70. The seven are the one liberated in both respects, the one libera ted by wisdom, the body witness, the one attained to view, the one liberated by faith, the Dham ma follower, and the faith follower. The first two are arahants, who are distinguished in that the former can also attain the "peaceful formless emancipations" (the form ­ less meditations and the attainment of cessation) while the latter cannot. The m iddle three are types of sekhas, disciples in higher training, who are distinguished according to their

 dominant faculty. The first excels in concentration, the second in wisdom , the third in faith. As 3:21 points out, these three cannot be ranked against one another in terms of superiority, since each can com prise anyone ranging from a stream -enterer to a person on the path to arahantship. The Dhamma follower and the faith follower are tw o types who have entered the path to stream -entry but have not yet attained the fruit. They are distinguished respectively by whether their dominant faculty is wisdom or faith. A t the end of 7:56, the Buddha m entions another "seventh p erson " in place of the faith follower. This type is called "one w ho dwells in the mark]ess" {animittaviharl), a term unexplained in the sutta itself and never taken up for elaboration in the post-canonical Buddhist tradition. The com ­ mentary simply identifies this figure with the faith follower, but that m ay be an attem pt to fit unusuaL ideas into the slots of an established system . The ideal spiritual figure of AN , as of the Nikayas. as a w hole, is the arahant, w ho is called "the best among devas and hum ans: one who has reached the ultimate conclusion, won ultimate secu­ rity from bondage, lived the ultimate spiritual life, and gained the ultimate consum m ation" (3:143,11:10). The arahants "have destroyed the taints, lived the spiritual life, done w hat had to be done, laid dow n the burden, reached their own goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, and are completely liberated through final know ledge" (6:49, 9:7). They are "devoid of lust through the destruction of lust; devoid of hatred through the destruction of hatred; devoid of delusion through the destruc­ tion of delusion" (6:55). They are no longer subject to return to any realm of existence, w hether sense-sphere existence, form - sphere existence, or form less-sphere existence (9:25). They enter and dwell in the taintless liberation of mind, the liberation by wisdom, and on their passing aw ay attain final nibbana. Though all arahants are alike in their eradication of all defile­ ments and their liberation from sam sara, AN introduces an interesting distinction betw een two kinds of arahants. One, the "white-lorus ascetic" (pundarlkasamana), does not attain the eight em ancipations, w hile the other, the "red-lotus ascetic" (padumasamana), does so. The com m entary interprets the first type as one w ho attains none of the eight emancipations, and

 arahantship w ithout attainm ent of the jhanas. This figure is not explicitly found in the Nikayas, and thus questions m ay be raised whether the com m entary is not reading into the text an idea arisen from a later period. An interpretation that accords better with such suttas as M N 70 would regard the white-lotus ascetic as the arahant "liberated by wisdom", (pannavimutta), who can attain the four jhanas but not the formless em ancipa­ tions, while the red-lotus ascetic would be the arahant "liber­ ated in both respects" (ubhatobhagav.imutta).. in addition to the jhanas and the formless emancipations, some arahants attain the "three true know ledges": knowledge of past lives, knowledge of the passing aw ay and rebirth of beings, and knowledge of the destruction of the qsavas (3:58). Still others attain six superior knowledges, which include, in addition to the three just m en­ tioned/the psychic pow ers, the divine ear, and the knowledge of the minds of others (6:2). .

 T y p e s o f P e r s o n s

 The Anguttara is distinguished among the four Nikayas by its interest in defining and describing types of persons. These clas­ sifications are not proposed from the standpoint of objective psychological analysis but in order to relate different types of persons to the values and goals of the Dhamma. Most, but not all, of the distinctions are draw n am ong monastics and are put forward as pairs or groups w ith three or more types. We thus find distinctions draw n between such personal­ ity types as the fool and the wise person, the bad person and the good person, the blam ew orthy monk and the esteem ed monk. This last pair is som etim es painted in finer detail by describing more fully the characteristics of the monk who is incorrigibly evil and the m onk held up as an exemplar. Similar distinctions are draw n betw een laypersons, so that we have laypeople of bad intent and those who serve as examples for the lay community. One distinction draw n am ong persons should dispel a miscon­ ception about early Buddhism that in recent years has receded but may not be com pletely extinct: namely, that in its stress on personal responsibility it w as narrowly individualistic. In later

###### attitudes that prevailed in certain sections of the Sangha) led to the designation H lnayana, or "Little Vehicle/' being ascribed to the schools that adhered to the ancient scriptures. A series of suttas, 4:95-99, distinguishes persons into four types ranked by way of ascending excellence: (1) one who is practicing neither for his own welfare nor for the welfare of others; (2) one who is practicing for the welfare of others but not for his own welfare; (3) one who is practicing for his own welfare but not for the welfare of others; and (4) one who is practicing both for his own welfare and for the welfare of others. The text not only rates the fourth as best but com m ends it in superlatives as "the foremost, the best, the preem inent, the supreme, and the finest of these four persons." Another series of suttas, 5:17—20, explains how a bhikkhu can practice for his own welfare and the welfare of others. And still another sutta broadens the altruistic motiva­ tion further, concluding.that a person of great wisdom "thinks only of his own w elfare, the welfare of others, the welfare of both, and the welfare of the whole world" (4:186).

 Although most of the suttas in AN are addressed to bhikkhus and describe their subjects as such, they occasionally feature bhikkhunls, fully ordained nuns, as their protagonists or sub­ jects. We find in A N the story of the origins of the Bhikkhuni Sangha (8:51) as preserved also in the Colavagga of the Vinaya. The story is controversial: first, because of the Buddha's ini­ tial reluctance to allow w om en to enter the homeless life; and second, because, after giving them permission to go forth, he declares that the ordination of wom en will have a corrosive effect on the teaching, shortening its life span from a thousand years to five hundred years. W hether such an account is histori­ cally trustworthy has been questioned by modern-day schol­ ars, for it contains anachronism s hard to reconcile with other chronological inform ation in the canon and commentaries. But the sutta has been responsible for a distrustful attitude toward bhikkhunis in Theravada countries and may explain why con­ servative elders have resisted the revival of the Bhikkhuni Sangha currently taking place in such countries as Sri Lanka and Thailand..


-----

###### AN includes, in the sequence on foremost disciples, a section on outstanding bhikkhunls. But w hereas the section on bhik­ khus consists of four vaggas containing forty-seven categories (several occupied by the same person), that on bhikkhunis con­ tains only one vagga with thirteen names. Perhaps this was because the number of bhikkhuniis w as much smaller than the number of bhikkhus, but it may also reflect the biases of the age and perhaps attitudes that prevailed in the school that preserved the Pali Canon. It seems that the Ekottaragam a of the Chinese Tripitaka, stemming from another early school, includes many more bhikkhunis among the em inent disciples. At 7:56 the Buddha reports that tw o deities informed him that a number, of bhikkhunis have been "well liberated with­ out residue remaining." In 8:53, he explains to the bhikkhuni MahapajapatiGotami the eight qualities distinctive of the proper Dhamma and discipline. In 10:28 a "bhikkhuni from Kajangala" responds to ten numerical questions. W hen her answers are related to the Buddha, he says: "The bhikkhuni of Kajangala is wise, of great wisdom. If you had asked me about this matter, I would have answered exactly as she has done." But it is not only in favorable term s that AN speaks about bhikkhunis. A series of six suttas, 5:115-20, explains various causes for bhikkhunis to be reborn in hell. She is miserly, she criticizes and praises others indiscrim inately, she squanders gifts given out of faith, she is envious, holds wrong views, speaks and acts wrongly, and so on. It is puzzling that the text should single out bhikkhunis for such stern remarks, but per­ haps they were seen as necessary precautions. In any case, at 5:236-40 the same statements are m ade about bhikkhus. Among the four Nikayas, A N has the largest number of suttas addressed to women,9 but a small number of discourses in the collection testify to a misogynistic attitude that strikes us as discordant, distasteful, and sim ply unjustified. These texts depict women as driven by pow erful passions that impair their abilities and undermine their morals. At 2:61, the Buddha declares that women are never satiated in two things: sexual intercourse and giving birth. W hen Ananda asks why women do not sit on councils, engage in business, or travel to distant regions, the Buddha answers that this is because they are full of anger, envious, miserly, and devoid of wisdom (4:80). Two


-----

###### suttas compare women to a black snake (5:229-30) in that they are "wrathful, hostile, of deadly venom , double-tongued, and betray friends." Their venom is their strong lust, their double tongue is their proclivity to slander, and they betray friends in that "for the most part w om en are adulterous." In 5:55 we read about a mother and son w ho w ere ordained as bhikkhuni and bhikkhu. They continued to keep close com pany, fell in love, and indulged in sexual relations w ith one another. When this was reported to the Buddha, he is show n laying the blame on women: "If one could rightly say of anything that it is entirely a snare of Mara, it is precisely of w om en that one might say this." W hether these statements should really be attributed to the Buddha or regarded as interpolations by monastic editors is a question that m ay not be possible to settle with complete cer­ tainty. Such statements, how ever, are surely contrary to the more, liberal spirit displayed.else w here in the Nikayas. More­ over, in a text like AN, with its m any short suttas, it would have been relatively easy for monks, apprehensive about their own sexuality or the spiritual potentials of w om en, to insert such passages into the canon. These suttas do not have counterparts in the Chinese Agamas, but that fact on its ow n is inconclusive; for m any suttas in the Pali A nguttara N ikaya are without coun­ terparts in the Chinese canon. O ther suttas in A N that deal with sexuality show a more sym m etrical approach, such as 1:1-10, 7:51, and 8:17-18, where the sexual attractions of men toward wom en and of women tow ard m en are precisely balanced. Quite in contrast to the suttas w ith a misogynistic tone are others that show the Buddha acting cordially toward women and generously bestowing his teaching upon them. He teaches the lay devotee Visakha how the uposatha observance can be of great fruit and benefit (3:70, 8:43). H e teaches Suppavasa the merits of giving food (4:57). H e explains to Queen Mallika, the wife of King Pasenadi, the karm ic causes through which wom en can achieve beauty, w ealth, and influence (4:197). He answers the questions of the princess Cundi on the best kinds of confidence and virtuous behavior (5:32). H e instructs a group of girls about to be m arried on how to behave when they go to live with their husbands (5:33), and he instructs a boister­ ous wife about the seven kinds of w ives (7:63). He explains

He extols the bhikkhunls Khema and Uppalavanna as models for his bhikkhuni followers and the female lay devotees Khujjuttara and Velukantakl Nandamata as models for his female lay disciples (4:176). It is hard to reconcile such texts, which display a friendly and em pathetic attitude tow ard women, with the passages that categorically denigrate their capacities.

 T h e R e p e t i t i o n S e r ie s

 Each of the nipatas from the Twos to the Elevens concludes with a "Lust and So Forth Repetition Series" (ragadipeyyala).10 This is created by establishing perm utations am ong three sequences of terms. One is a list of seventeen defilem ents: lust, hatred, delusion, anger, hostility, denigration, insolence, envy, miser­ liness, deceitfulness, craftiness, obstinacy, vehemence, conceit, arrogance, intoxication, and heedlessness. The second is a series of ten terms showing the tasks that are to be fulfilled in relation to these seventeen defilements: direct knowledge, full under­ standing, utter destruction, abandoning/ destruction, vanish­ ing, fading away, cessation, giving up, and relinquishment. The first two are com plem entary cognitive operations; the other eight are synonyms for eradication by w orld-transcending wisdom . Taken in combination, w e obtain an initial total of 170 operations. The third sequence of terms consists of sets of practices that fall under the numerical rubric of the nipata. These m ay be as few as one or as many as five. Each set of practices is applied to each of the 170 operations, generating a sutta for each pos­ sibility. The Twos and Threes each have only one set of prac­ tices: the pair of serenity and insight in the Twos and the three kinds of concentration in the Threes. Thus in each of these two ?ripatas only 170 suttas are generated. But the Fours have three practice sets: the four establishments, of mindfulness, the four right strivings, and the four bases of psychic potency. So this nipata generates 510 suttas. The Fives have five practice sets, which generates the m axim um num ber of repetition suttas: 850. Several nipatas have three sets, generating 510 suttas each. On account of the repetition series, the num ber of suttas in AN

 Apart from the "Lust and So Forth Repetition Series/' AN exhib­ its a number of other formal features that deserve brief comment. One is what I call "expanded parallels/' An expanded parallel is a sutta that is modeled on an earlier sutta and includes its con­ tents (or most of its contents) but then introduces another item that elevates it to a higher nipata. I m ention these in the notes, but it is useful to look at them collectively. To assist with this, I have included a list of expanded parallels as appendix 1. Most expanded parallels extend over only tw o nipatas, which may follow in immediate succession or be m ore widely separated. The most extensive expanded parallelism in AN is a series of terms on the successive steps culm inating in "the knowledge and vision of liberation/' It occurs in six nipatas. The sequence first appears in 5:24, and then reappears, enlarged by the addi­ tion of factors, in 6:50, 7:65, 8:81, 10:3, and 11:3. The next full­ est set of expanded parallels is a group of perceptions said to "culminate in the deathless" that occurs four times. This set first appears in 5:61 and reappears in 7:48, 9:16, and 10;56. In the third m ost prominent set, the bhikkhu Kimbila asks the Bud­ dha why the Dhamma does not endure long after the passing aw ay of a Tathagata. The set occurs three times, at 5:201, 6:40, and 7:59. The others that I have discovered all extend only over two nipatas. Their topics range from reverence for mother and father,-to the ways an evil monk resembles a m aster thief, to the special samadhi that a bhikkhu enters to perceive nibbana. A second formal feature is w hat I call "com posite numeri­ cal suttas." These are discourses that acquire the number of items characteristic of a particular nipata by combining smaller sets of terms. These composites are listed in appendix 2. For example, a series of suttas at 6:105-16 arrives at six items by combining sets of three defilements w ith three counteractive measures per sutta. Another sutta, 7:58, falls into the Sevens by combining four things that the Tathagata need not hide with three ways he is irreproachable. A t 8:49, the Buddha teaches Visakha four ways a woman is heading for victory in this world


-----

###### and four ways she is heading for victory in the next world. In 9:3, he explains to his attendant Meghiya five things that mature the mind for liberation and then teaches him four meditation subjects: Occasionally multiple sets are combined. Thus 11:10 enumerates three groups of three qualities, and one pair of qual­ ities, that make a bhikkhu "best among devas and hum ans." In this w ay the sutta fits into the Elevens. The num ber of suttas in AN is increased by several tech­ niques that amplify the amount of m aterial w ithout adding m uch significantly new to the content. Some suttas share a com m on mold and multiply themselves by using a few. nearly synonym ous terms to make the sam e point. An exam ple is 3:6-8, w hich describe the distinction between the fool and the wise person simply by using different descriptive words. An alternative method of establishing a variation is to use a differ­ ent image to convey the point. Thus 3:51 and 3:52 are virtually identical in content, but one uses the im age of a flood sweeping over the world, the other the image of a fire. Tow ard the end of the Threes, seven suttas, 3:156-62, are created from the same mold simply by changing the group of "aids to enligh tenment" taken to represent the middle way. In som e suttas the subject remains the same but the content used to define the subject differs. A n example is 4:201-6, where the subject is constant, namely, the bad person and the good person, but the qualities that pertain to each type differ from one sutta to the next. Another recurrent formal technique in AN is to include in close proxim ity two or more suttas on the same topic, the first simply enunciating a set of factors and the second giving formal definitions of them. Examples of this are fairly num erous. Thus 4:161 enumerates the four modes of practice without explana­ tion, while 4:162-63 elaborate on them , Sutta 4:232 enum er­ ates the four kinds of kamma, while 4:233-38 define them and explore them from several angles. Suttas 5:1—2 provide back-to- back enumerations and definitions of the five trainee's powers; 5:13—14 do the same for the five powers; 7:3^4 treat seven pow­ ers in this w ay; and 7:5-6 declare and define the seven kinds of noble wealth. Again, 8:5-6 applies this treatm ent to the eight worldly conditions, and 10:19-20 do the sam e for the ten abodes of the noble ones. Occasionally a large gap separates rhe brief and the detailed treatment; for instance, 6:9 enum erates the six


-----

###### things unsurpassed, but their elaboration com es only at 6:30. This raises the question how such gaps could have entered, but it is difficult to give a cogent explanation. Still another interesting feature of A N (noticeable, too, in the Sam yutta Nikaya) is the use of what I call "auditor-setting vari­ ants." W ith this technique, a discourse having the exact same content is given to several people. Thus in 8:25 and 8:26 the Bud­ dha answ ers the same questions on the qualities of a lay disciple raised respectively by Mahanama and Jlvaka. In 8:43 and 8:45 he gives the sam e discourse bn the uposatha to Visakha and Bojjha, and in 8:91-117 (much abridged) to tw enty-seven other w om en, if w e are to trust the com m entary. Often the Buddha will deliver a discourse to an individual and then, in another sutta, say the same thing to the monks. Thus in 4:53 he speaks about different kinds of marriage to a group of householders and then teaches the same thing to the monks in 4:54. He teaches Anathapindika how a noble disciple m ight declare himself a stream -enterer in 8:28 and in 8:29 repeats the sam e explanation to the m onks. There is variation not only in the auditor but in the speaker. One of the m onks, usually Sariputta, gives a discourse that repeats exactly w hat the Buddha said earlier. W e see examples of this in 5:163-64, which mirror 5:65-66; in 8:77—78, w hich mir­ ror 8 :61 -6 2; and in 10:4 and 10:5, where Sariputta and Anarida give the sam e discourse that the Buddha gave in 10:3. It is a puzzle w hy such suttas were included in the Nikaya when there is no difference in their contents from those given by the Bud­ dha himself. There are several instances of tw o suttas that appear to be "expanded parallels" but in which the content is so different that the parallelism is dubious. M oreover, the fram ew ork of these paired suttas is such that it is virtually im possible for both to have been historically authentic. Thus the Buddha gives discourses on the visible benefits of giving to the general Siha at 5:34 and 7:57. Yet the content differs so m uch that one may well doubt that the Buddha really spoke both to Siha. The case is ever, stronger with regard to 6:44 and 10:75, w here on two dif­ ferent occasions a lay w om an named M igasala m akes the same com plaint about statements the Buddha issued concerning the rebirth of her father and her uncle. The Buddha's responses to

###### the criticism differ prominently on each occasion, and it thus seem s improbable that both are reproducing actual statements m ade w ithin the same narrative framework. In the Tens, w e m eet two large blocks of text that state the sam e thing across forty or fifty suttas, using tw o different doctrinal lists to provide content. In 1 0:11 3-66 the subject is the tenfold rightness, and in 10:167-210 it is the ten courses of unw holesom e and'wholesom e kamma. The num ber of short suttas in A N is increased still more by the use of perm utations to generate a large number of texts from a few sim ple doctrinal sets. I explained aBove how this was done in the "L u st and So Forth Repetition Series." A similar process is used in 7:95-622 to generate. 520 suttas by combining modes of contem plation with different objects. Again, at the end of the Elevens, 960 suttas are created by a. similar process of combination and perm utation.

 To assist the reader in understanding the suttas, I have pro­ vided a copious set of notes. The notes serve at least four pur­ poses: (1) to provide background information to the sutta; (2) to explain obscure w ords or phrases in the original; (3) to bring out the doctrinal implications of a statement; (4) and to make explicit the reading I have adopted am ong com peting alterna­ tives. As noted above, my translation relies on the Sri Lankan, Burm ese, and PTS editions of AN, which occasionally differ in their readings. I have used the Sri Lankan Buddha Jayanti edi­ tion as m y prim ary text, but I sometimes prefer readings from one of the other versions or from a m anuscript referred to in the notes to these editifvhs. For the benefit of those w ith access to the Pali text, I feel obliged to state which reading I have chosen, to record plausible variants, and,sometimes to explain w hy I made the choice I did over and against the alternatives. In the notes (as in this introduction) references to A N suttas have been set in bold. W hen a textual source is followed by volum e, page, and (sometimes) line numbers, these refer to the PTS editions. Many^of the notes are draw n from the authorized Pali com m entary On AN, the Anguttara Nikaya-atthakatha, also known by its propernam e, the Manorathapuram (M p), "The Ful- filler of W ishes " Tffisis ascribed to the great Buddhist com m en-

###### tator A cariya Buddhaghosa, who cam e from South India to Sri Lanka in the fifth century c.e. and compiled the commentaries to the canonical texts on the basis of the ancient Sinhala com m en­ taries (no longer extant) that had been kept at the M ahavihara in Anuradhapura. Buddhaghosa occasionally refers to the "Great C om m entary" (Maha Atthakatha) as the source of his own com­ m entary. In the colophon to the Manorathapuram he says that he completed it "by taking the essence of the Great Com m entary" (sa . hi mahaatthakathaya saramaddya nitthita esd). W hereas the canoni­ cal texts had been preserved in Pali, the Great Com m entary had been transmitted in the old Sinhala language, intelligible only to the residents of the island (and perhaps by Buddhaghosa's time only to the most erudite among them). Buddhaghosa trans­ lated this material into lucid and elegant Pali, thereby making it accessible to the bhikkhus in India and perhaps in the out­ lying regions to which Buddhism had spread. In his colophon to the w ork, Buddhaghosa explains why he gave his commentary its title, using the w ord Agamas instead of the m ore familiar Nikayas to designate the four main, sutta collections:

###### Because this work fulfilled my wish to com m ent on all the Agam as, it has been given the name "The Fulfiller of W ishes."11

 The other exegetical work to wldch I occasionally refer is the subcom m entary, the Anguttara Nikaya-tika, also know n as the Manorathapurani-tika (Mp-t) and under its proper nam e, the Saratthamanjusa IV-tika, "The Casket of the Essential Meaning, Part IV." This subcommentary does not belong to the set of "old subcommentaries" (puranatlka), known as the Linatthappakasini and ascribed to Acariya Dhammapala, the (seventh-century?) South Indian author of the subcommentaries to the other three N ikayas.12 It is ascribed, rather, to the great Sri Lankan elder Sariputta, w ho worked during the reign of King Parakram a- bahu I (1153-86) at the capital Polonnaruwa. Since the sutta and com m entary are usually sufficiently clear on their own, I have not had to refer to the tika as often as I did to the Samyutta Nikaya- purdnatikd in m y notes to the Connected Discourses of the Buddha. Words in bold in Pali citations from the com m entary and tika rep­ resent the lemma, the word or phrase being com m ented upon.


-----

###### I should state, as a precaution, that as useful as they are, the commentaries explain the suttas as they were understood some­ time around the first century C .E ., when the old commentaries drawn upon by Buddhaghosa were closed to further additions. The commentaries view the suttas through the lens of the com ­ plex exegetical m ethod that had evolved within the Theravada school, built up from the interpretations of the ancient teach­ ers and welded to a framework constructed largely from the principles of the Abhidhamma system. This exegetical method does not necessarily correspond to the way the teachings were understood in the earliest period of Buddhist history, but it seems likely that its nucleus goes back to the first generation of monks w ho had gathered around the Buddha and w ere entrusted with the task of giving detailed systematic explana­ tions of his discourses. The fact that I cite the commentaries so often in the notes, does not necessarily mean that I always agree with them , though where I interpret a passage differently I generally say so. I want to briefly mention two tenets, central to the commen- tarial method, that seem to be in tension with the texts them ­ selves. Both m ust have emerged when the early teachings were being recast into the m ore rigorous and analytically precise system that underlies the Theravada Abhidhamma. The stages by which the doctrinal evolution from suttas to Abhidhamma occurred, and the specific maneuvers involved, are still barely understood in detail and thus constitute a wide-open field for scholarly investigation. The first tenet distinctive of the commentaries concerns the meaning of the term s path and fruit. In the Abhidhamma, the four stages of aw akening are regarded as temporal events, each consisting of two phases joined in immediate succession. First comes a single mind-moment known as the path (ntagga), which is followed at once by its corresponding fruition (phala). Thus there are the paths of stream-entry, once-returning, no.n- returning, and arahantship, each followed in immediate suc­ cession respectively by the fruit of stream-entry and so forth. The path is sometim es called the "world-transcending path" (lokuttaramagga), to distinguish it from the preliminary or pre­ paratory practice (pubbabhagapatipada), the course of training leading up to the world-transcending path. The commentaries


-----

###### take up this schem e from the Abhidhamma and apply it as a tool of exegesis, reading it back into the early suttas as if it had already been intended by the original texts. I m entioned above (pp. 55-56) that in the Nikayas, the noble Sangha is said to consist of eight types of noble persons, who are joined into four pairs in relation to the four stages of awakening: the person practicing for realization of a particular fruit and the person who has attained that fruit. The commentaries identify the per­ son practicing for the attainm ent with the path-attainer of the Abhidhamma, and the one who has attained the corresponding fruit with the one who has undergone the fruition experience. In the N ikayas, no such tenet is discernible, at least not in this form. The N ikayas call the crucial awakening experience the ''breakthrough to the D ham m a" (dhammabhisamaya) or the "gaining of the D ham m a eye" (dhammacakkhupatilabha). The experience appears to be sudden, but it is not identified with the path as such nor is it said to last only a single mind-moment. Several suttas suggest, to the contrary, that the path is a tem ­ porally extended course of practice that becomes irreversible when the disciple enters "the fixed course of rightness" (okkanto sammattaniyamam). A t that point the practitioner transcends the level of a worldling or ordinary person (puthujjana) and becomes either a D ham m a follow er (dhammanusari) or a faith follower (saddhanusari). W hile reaching.the path guarantees realization of the fruit, the fruit does not necessarily arise a m om ent after entering the path. All that the texts say is that those w ho have entered the fixed course of rightness cannot pass away w ithout realizing the fruit of stream -entry (see SN 25:1; III 224). This implies that further practice, perhaps over days or weeks, m ay be needed to realize the fruit. Once the path has arisen, the practitioner then "pursues this path, develops it, and cultivates it," as a result of which "the fet­ ters are abandoned and the underlying tendencies are uprooted" (4:170). These expressions suggest that the path is an extended process of cultivation rather than an instantaneous event. Though the course of practice will be punctuated by sudden breakthrough attainm ents, the w ord "path" itself refers to the whole process of developm ent rather than a momentary event, and the fruit seem s to be simply the attainment of the relevant stage of aw akening, not a special contemplative experience.


-----

###### Further support in AN for the extended nature of the path is at 8:22. Here the householder Ugga declares that when he is serving the Sangha with a meal, though deities inform him of the monks' spiritual attainments, he still serves them equally, without being biased on the basis of their spiritual status. Among those who receive his offerings are faith followers and Dhamma followers. If these persons existed as such only for the . duration of a m om entary breakthrough experience, it is hard to see how they could be spoken of as recipients of a meal offer­ ing. It certainly takes m ore than one mind-moment to receive and eat a meal. Hie second point over which some degree of tension surfaces between the Nikayas and the commentaries concerns the ques­ tion whether rebirth occurs immediately after death or after an interval of time. During the age of Sectarian Buddhism , when different schools branched off from the originally uni­ fied Sangha and doctrinal differences began to emerge, the Pali school adopted the tenet that rebirth occurs in the very m om ent following death, with no interval separating the moments of death and rebirth (or reconception). It seems that this position, articulated in the commentaries, is based on a particular read­ ing of certain passages in the final book of the Abhidham m a Pi taka, the Patthana. Yet there are suttas that can be read as contradicting this doctrinal position. The Anguttara offers one of the strongest counterweights against the hypothesis of instantaneous rebirth. The N ikayas often analyze the person at the third stage of realization, the anagaml or non-returner, into five subtypes. The first among them , the one w ith the sharpest faculties, is called antaraparinibbayj, w hich I render "an attainer of nibbana in the interval." The com m entaries explain this figure as one w ho attains nibbana in the first l>alf of the life span; they then go on to interpret the other four types in a way that accords with this explanation. H ow ever, 7:55 distinguishes three subtypes of antaraparinibbdyl, each of which it illustrates with a simile. The similes— of a blazing m etal chip going out at different points before hitting the ground— suggest that the antaraparinibbayi attains nibbana before taking rebirth, thus supporting the hypo­ thesis of an interm ediate stage separating death and rebirth, at least for certain iion-retum ers (but surely capable of a broader

 generalization). This w as the position advocated by some of the rival schools w ith w hich the Theravada competed on Indian soil, most notably the Sarvastivadins. Similes are not alw ays a reliable basis for draw ing doctri­ nal conclusions, and the question whether rebirth is instanta­ neous or follows an interval seems to have minimal practical importance. But a com m itm ent to instantaneous rebirth is fun­ damental to the Theravada commentaries. The tone of certain arguments in the com m entaries suggests that among the early Indian Buddhist schools, the issue generated a degree of heat that hardly seems w arranted by its practical bearings. Perhaps underlying the conflict w as apprehension that acknow ledg­ ment of an interm ediate state could be taken to im ply a self or soul that m igrates from life to life. But other schools felt comfortable enough accepting the intermediate state w ithout seeing it: as threatening the doctrine of non-self.

 T h e C h i n e s e P a r a l l e l s

 In my notes I have also occasionally compared the Pali versions of suttas-in AN writh their parallels preserved in Chinese trans­ lation, primarily in the Chinese Agamas and occasionally in independent translations. I mentioned above (p. 17) that there is a counterpart to A N that had been translated into Chinese, the Ekottaragam a or Ekottarikagam a. It would be a mistake, however, to suppose that the Pali Anguttara Nikaya and the Ekottaragama are close parallels. While the four Pali N ikayas ail belonged to one school, known today as the Theravada, the four Agamas in Chinese translation derived from several schools that arose during the period of Sectarian Buddhism , none identical with the p ro­ genitor of the Theravada. The Dlrghagama (counterpart of the Digha N ikaya) w as translated from a version belonging to the D harm aguptaka school, which flourished in G andhara. The M adhyam agam a (counterpart of the Majjhima Nikaya) is believed to have descended from a branch of the Sarvastivada. According to Enom oto, its affiliation was most likely w ith the Kashmirian Sarvastivadins.13 Enomoto finds reasons for ascrib­ ing the Chinese Sam yuktagam a (counterpart of the Sainyutta


-----

###### in Mathura.14 The school affiliation of the Ekottaragama is prob­ lematic. Anesaki wrote over a century ago that"there are strong reasons to believe that the version was made from a text handed down by a school which had a very different tradition from the Theravada, possibly by one of the Mahasamghika sections."15 Its affiliation with the M ahasamghikas became a widespread supposition, often stated as a m atter of fact. However, more recently, Enomoto writes that questions concerning the school, place of formation, and language of the original text of this work "have yet to be solved."16 . Because the Agamas descend from different schools, the arrangement of their contents differs. While the different schools all apparently distributed their suttas into four main collections with the same names, they m ade different choices in their allo­ cation of the material. Thus the parallels of many shorter suttas that the Pali tradition assigned to A N are to be found, in the Chinese Agamas, in the Samyuktagam a (for example, the par­ allels of 3:81-90 all occur in SA, the parallel of 4:111 is SA 923, the parallel of 5:167 is SA 497, etc.). Often the parallels of longer AN suttas occur in the Chinese M adhyam agam a (for example, 6:43 occurs, as MA 118, 7:55 as M A 6, 10:51 as MA 110, etc.). Since the school affiliations were different, it is not unusual for an AN sutta to have two or m ore parallels in the Agamas, as well as one or more independent translations. To take but one example, 6:55, the Buddha's advice to the bhikkhu Sona, occurs as MA 123, SA 254, EA 23.3, and as two independent translations. There are also m any AN suttas that are without Agama parallels. Comparisons between the Pali and Agama versions proved helpful in a number of respects. Sometimes a simpler Chi­ nese translation helped to clarify the intention of a phrase that seemed unnecessarily convoluted in Pali. For example, the plea that somebody makes to the Buddha when he wants to avoid misrepresenting him (see 3:57) is so complex that it even mis­ led the commentator into giving an implausible e?q)lanation. The Chinese treatment of the sam e phrase (see p. 1646, note 416) supports the simpler explanation borne out by another occurrence of the Pali expression in a different context at 5:5. Sometimes, when there w as a discrepancy between readings of a Pali expression, the Chinese version, by agreeing with one as

 against the other, supported its claim to antiquity. For example, a verse in 4:40 describes the Buddhas as yannassa kovida, "skilled in sacrifice/" in the Be version, but in the Ce and Ee versions the phrase is read punfiassa kovida, "skilled in m erit." Two Chinese parallels render the phrase in a w ay that indicates its trans­ lators were working from an original that said the Buddhas were skilled in sacrifice, thereby supporting Be. Again, there is a verse spoken by the bhikkhu U dayl in 6:43 in which all three printed editions of AN read the third line as sankharesupasantesu, meaning "when all conditioned things have become still," but a Burmese variant (referred to.in the notes Of Be and Ee) and the version in the Theragatha read it as angaresu ca santesu, meaning "w hen the coals have gone out/'. The Chinese parallel, though not exactly identical/still supports the Burmese variant against the three printed editions of A N (see p. 1758, note 1326). Another interesting exam ple is at 10:26 (see p.. 1838, note 2000) where in Ce and Ee we find a triad adi, adinava/nissarana instead of the usual assada, adinava, nissarana. The editors of Be obviously assumed an error had occurred here and replaced adi with assada. But the Chinese parallel has which corresponds to adi, not to assada, and thereby confirm s the antiquity of the Ce and Ee reading. A sutta near the end of the Tens, 10:219, "The Deed-Born Body," contains no set of ten items to explain its inclusion in the Tens, but the text uses a demonstrative pronoun to refer to a subject who w as not previously introduced; so it seems as if a passage had been elided in the course of transmis­ sion. The Chinese parallel, M A 15, begins with the Buddha enu­ merating the ten types of unw holesom e kamma. It then asserts that a noble disciple discards those ten kinds of kamma, and following this comes a passage referring to that disciple with a demonstrative pronoun. Thus this version shows that a passage with ten items had in fact been elided from the AN sutta. An intriguing divergence betw een the two traditions occurs in a discourse widely known as the Kalam a Sutta, which records the Buddha's advice to the people of Kesaputta. In contempo­ rary Buddhist circles it has becom e almost de rigucur to regard the Kalama Sutta as the essential Buddhist text, almost equal in importance to the discourse on the four noble truths. The sutta is held up as proof that the Buddha anticipated Western empiri­

 the personal determination of truth. Though until the late nine­ teenth century this sutta w as just one small hill in the mountain range of the Nikayas, since the start of the twentieth century it has become one of the m ost com m only quoted Buddhist texts, offered as the key to convince those with modernist leanings that the Buddha was their forerunner. H ow ever, the Chinese parallel to the Kalama Sutta, M A 16 (at T I 438bl3—439c22), is quite-different. Here the Buddha does not ask the Kalamas to resolve their doubts by judging m atters for themselves. Instead, he advises them not to give rise to doubt and perplexity and he tells them point, blank: "Y ou yourselves do not have pure . wisdom with which to know w hether there is an afterlife or not. Ycu yourselves do not have pure wisdom to know which deeds are transgressions and w hich are not transgressions." He then explains to them the three unwholesom e roots of kamma, how they lead to moral transgressions, and the ten courses of wholesome kamma. In other instances, the Pali and Chinese versions of a sutta offer such different perspectives one can only conclude that the original in one tradition w as inverted, but we cannot say for sure which one underw ent inversion. A case in point is 2:36, in which Sariputta speaks about "th e person fettered inter­ nally" and "the person fettered externally." In the Pali version Sariputta explains the form er as "a returner, one who returns to this state of being" (that is, to the sense sphere) and the latter as "a non-returner, one who does not return to this state of being." But che Chinese parallel inverts this explanation: "The person with an internal fetter is the non-returner, who does not come back to this world. And the person w ith an external fetter is one who is not a non-returner but w ho com es back to this world." In a case like this it is virtually impossible to mediate between the two versions> and there is little to fall back on to support one reading as against the other.

 Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One

 I. E n t e r in g u p o n t h e R a in s

 1 (1) Faults Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwell­ ing at SavatthI in Jeta's Grove, A nathapindika's Park. There the Blessed O ne addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!" "Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this: "Bhikkhus, there are these tw o faults' W h at two? The fault pertaining to the present life and the fault pertaining to the future life. "A nd w hat is the fault pertaining to the present life? Here, som eone sees that when kings arrest a robber, a criminal, they subject him to various punishm ents: they have him flogged w ith whips, beaten with canes, beaten w ith clubs; they have his. hands cut off, his feet cut off, his hands and feet cut off; his ears cut off, his nose cut off, his ears and nose cut off; they have him subjected to the porridge p o t/ to the 'polished-shell sh ave/ to the 'Rahu's m ou th / to the 'fiery w re a th / to the 'flaming h an d / to the 'blades of grass/ [48] to the 'bark d re ss/ to the 'antelope/ to the 'm eat hooks/ to the 'co in s/ to the 'lye pickling/ to the 'pivoting p in / to the 'rolled-up palliasse'; and they have him splashed with boiling oil, and they have him devoured by dogs, and they have him impaled alive on stakes, and they have his head cut off with a sword.216 "It occurs to him: 'When kings have arrested a robber, a crimi­ nal, they subject him to various punishm ents because of his bad deeds: they have him flogged w ith w h ip s... they have his

###### head cu t off w ith a sword. Now if I w ere to com m it such a bad deed, and if kings were to arrest me, they w ould subject me to the sam e punishments. They would have m e flogged w ith w h ip s... they w ould have m y head cut off with a sw o rd / Afraid of the fault pertaining to the present life, he does not plunder the belongings of others.217 This is called the fault pertaining to the present life. "A nd w hat is the fault pertaining to the future life? H ere, som eone reflects thus: 'Bodily m isconduct has a bad, painful result218 in the future life; verbal m isconduct has a bad, painful result in the future life; mental m isconduct has a bad, painful result in the future life. Now if I were to engage in m isconduct by body, speech, and mind, then, with the breakup of the body, after death, I w ould be reborn in the plane of m isery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell!7 [49] Afraid of the fault pertaining to the future life, he abandons bodily m isconduct and develops bodily good conduct; he abandons verbal m isconduct and develops verbal good conduct; he abandons m ental m iscon­ duct and develops mental good conduct; he m aintains him self in purity. This is called the fault pertaining to the future life. "T hese, bhikkhus, are the two faults. Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'W e will fear the fault pertain­ ing to the present life; we will fear the fault pertaining to the future life. W e will be fearful of faults and see peril in fau lts/ It is in such a w ay that you should train yourselves. It is to be expected that one w~ho is fearful of faults and sees peril in faults will be freed from all faults/'

 2 (2) Striving "Bhikkhus, there are these two strivings that are hard to achieve in the w orld. W hat two? The striving of laypeople w ho dwell at hom e for the purpose of presenting [m onastics with] robes, alm sfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick, and the striving of those who have gone forth from the house­ hold life into homelessness for the relinquishm ent of all acqui­ sitions. These are the two strivings that are hard to achieve in the w orld. "O f these tw o stri\dngs, bhikkhus, the forem ost is the striv­ ing for the relinquishment of all acquisitions.219 Therefore,, bhik­ khus, you should train yourselves thus: 'W e will strive for the


-----

###### relinquishm ent of all acquisitions/ It is in such a w ay that you should train yourselves."

 3 (3) Causing Torment "B hikkhus, there are these two things th at cause torm ent. W hat tw o? H ere, someone has engaged in bodily m isconduct but failed to engage in bodily good conduct; engaged in ver­ bal m isconduct but failed to engage in verbal good conduct; engaged in m ental m isconduct but failed to engage in m ental good conduct. He is tormented, [thinking]: T have engaged in bodily m isconduct'; he is torm ented, [thinking]: 'I have failed to engage in bodily good conduct'; he is torm ented, [thinking]: 'I have engaged in verbal m isconduct'; he is torm ented, [think­ ing]: 'I have failed to engage in verbal good co n d u ct'; he is torm ented, [thinking]: 'I have engaged in m ental m isconduct'; he is torm ented, [thinking]: 'I have failed to engage in m ental good co n d u ct/ These, bhikkhus, are the tw o things that cause to rm en t/'220

 4 (4) Not Causing Torment "Bhikkhus, there are these two things that do not cause torm ent.
 [50] W hat tw o? H ere, someone has engaged in bodily good conduct and avoided engaging in bodily m isconduct; engaged in verbal good conduct and avoided engaging in verbal m iscon­ duct; engaged in m ental good conduct and avoided engaging in m ental m isconduct. H e is not torm ented, [know ing]: 'I have engaged in bodily good conduct'; he is not torm ented, [know­ ing]:. 'I have avoided engaging in bodily m isconduct'; he is not torm ented, [knowing]: 'I have engaged in verbal good conduct'; he is not torm ented, [knowing]: T have avoided engaging in verbal m isconduct'; he is not torm ented, [know ing]: 'I have engaged in m ental good conduct'; he is not torm ented, [know­ ing]: 'I have avoided engaging in m ental m iscon d u ct.' These, bhikkhus, are the two things that do not cause torm en t."

 5 (5) Known "B h ik k h u s, I have personally know n tw o things: non- contentm ent in regard to wholesome qualities and indefatiga­ bility in striving.2’11 strove indefatigabiy, [resolved]'. 'W illingly, let only m y skin, sinews, and bones rem ain, and Jet the flesh

###### and blood dry up in m y body, but I will not relax m y energy so long as I have not attained what can be attained by m anly strength, energy, and exertion /222 It was by heedfulness that I achieved enlightenm ent, bhikkhus; it was by heedfulness that I achieved the unsurpassed security from bondage.223 "If, bhikkhus, you too w ould strive indefatigably, [resolved]: 'W illingly, let only m y skin, sinews, and bones rem ain, and let the flesh and blood d ry up in m y body, but I will not relax m y energy so long as I have not attained w hat can be attained by .manly strength, energy, and exertion/ you too will, in no. long time, realize for yourselves with direct knowledge; in this very life, that u nsurpassed consum m ation of the spiritual life for the sake of w hich clansm en rightly go forth from the household life into hom elessness, and having entered upon it, you will dwell in it. Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'W e w ill strive indefatigably, [resolved]: "W illingly, let only m y skin, sinew s, and bones remain, and let the flesh and blood dry up in m y body, but I will not relax m y energy so long as I have not attained w hat can be attained by m anly strength, energy, and exertion ."' It is in such a w ay that you should train yourselves." '

 6 (6) Fetter "Bhikkhus, there are these two things. W hat tw o? C on tem p la­ tion of gratification in things that can fetter and contem plation of disenchantm ent in things that can fetter.224 O ne w ho dw ells contem plating gratification in things that can fetter does [51] not abandon lust, hatred, and delusion. N ot having abandoned lust, h atred , and delusion, one is not freed from birth, from old age and d eath , from sorrow , lam entation, pain, dejection, and anguish; one is not freed from suffering, I say. O ne w ho dwells contemplating^ disenchantm ent in things that can fet­ ter abandons lust, hatred, and delusion. H aving abandoned lust, h atred, and delusion, one is freed from birth, from old age and death, from sorrow , lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish; one is freed from suffering, I say. These, bhikkhus, are the tw o thin gs."

 8 (8) Bright "Bhikkhus, there are these two bright qualities. W h at tw o? M oral sh am e and m oral dread.225 These are the tw o bright qualities."

 9 (9) Behavior "Bhikkhus, these tw o bright qualities protect the w orld. W hat tw o? M oral sham e and m oral dread. If these tw o bright quali­ ties did not protect the w orld, there w ould not be seen here
 [any restraint regarding] one's mother, aunts, or the w ives o f . one's teachers and [other] respected people.226 The w orld w ould becom e prom iscuous/like goats and sheep, chickens arid pigs> dogs and jackals. But because these two bright qualities protect the world , there is seen here [restraint regarding] one's m other, aunts, o r the w ives of one's teachers and [other] respected people."

 10 (10) Entering upon the Rains. "Bhikkhus, there are these two [occasions for] entering upon the rains.227 W hat tw o? The earlier and the later. These are the two [occasions for] entering upon the rains." [52] .

H aving abandoned lust, hatred, and delusion, one does not do anything unwholesome; one does not pursue anything bad. This is called the power of developm ent. "These, bhikkhus, are the two powers."

W ith the fading aw ay as well of rapture, he dwells equanim ous and, m indful and clearly com prehending, he experiences pleasure w ith the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhana of w hich the noble ones declare: 'H e is equani­ mous, mindful, one w ho dw ells happily/ W ith the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and w ith the previous passing aw ay of joy and dejection, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhana, neither painful nor pleasant, w hich has purification of mindfulness by equanimity.

"V enerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this: "Bhikkhus, w hatever perils arise all arise on account of the fool, not on accou n t of the wise person. W hatever calam ities arise all arise on accou n t of the fool,.not on account of the w ise person. W hatever m isfortunes arise all arise on account of the fool, not on accou n t of the wise person. Just as a fire that starts in a house m ade of reeds or grass burns down even a house with a peaked roof, plastered inside and out, draft-free, w ith bolts fastened and shutters closed; so too, whatever perils a rise ... all arise on account of the fool, not on account of the w ise person. (1) Thus, bhikkhus, the fool brings peril, the wise person brings no peril; (2) the fool brings calam ity, the wise person brings no calam ity; (3) the fool brings misfortune, the wise person brings no m isfortune. There is no peril from the wise person; there is no calam ity from the w ise person; there is no m isfortune from the wise person.

 [Because one considers:] 'Since w e are sim ilar with regard to virtuous behavior, we will have a discussion on virtuous behavior, and it will flow on sm oothly betw een us, and we will feel at ease. Since we are similar w ith regard to concentration, w e will have a discussion on concentration, and it will flow on sm oothly between us, and we will feel at ease. Since we are sim ilar with regard to w isdom , w e . will have a discussion on w isdom , and it will flow on sm oothly betw een us/arid we will feel at ease/ Therefore such a person is to be associated with, followed, and served. (3) "A nd what kind of person is to be associated with, followed, and served with honor and respect? H ere, som e person is superior [to oneself] in virtuous behavior, concentration, and w isdom . Such a person is to be associated w ith, followed, and served with honor and respect. For w hat reason? [Because one considers:] 'In such a wa}' I will fulfill the aggregate of virtuous behavior that I have not yet fulfilled or assist w ith Vvisdom in various respects the aggregate of virtuous behavior that I have fulfilled. I will fulfill the aggregate of concentration that I have not yet fulfilled or assist with w isdom in various respects the aggregate of concentration that I have fulfilled. I will fulfill the aggregate of wisdom that I have not yet fulfilled or assist with w isdom in various respects the aggregate of w isdom that I have fulfilled / 36? Therefore such a person is to be associated with, followed, and served with honor and respect. "These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons found existing in the w orld." [126]

 One who associates with an inferior person declines; one who associates with an equal does not decline; attending on a superior person one develops quickly; therefore you should follow one superior to yourself.

 H e does not possess such wealth, nor does he do deeds of merit; the blind m an destitute of eyes casts an unlucky throw in both respects.

 Mother and father are called "B rahm a" and also "first teachers." They are w orthy of gifts from their children, for they have com passion for their offspring.

 Therefore a wise person should revere them, and show them due honor, serve them with food and drink, with clothes and bedding, by massaging and bathing them , and by washing their, feet.

 Because of this service to mother and father, the wise praise one in this w orld and after death one rejoices in heaven.

 40 (10) Authorities "Bhikkhus, there are these three authorities. W hat three?

I am im m ersed in suffering, afflicted by suffering. Perhaps an ending of this entire m ass of suffering can be discerned."
 [148] As one who has gone forth from the household life into homelessness, it w ould not be proper for me to seek out sensual pleasures similar to or w orse than those that I have discarded.' He then reflects thus: 'E n ergy will be aroused in me w ithout slackening; m indfulness will be established without confusion; m y body will be tranquil w ithout disturbance; m y m ind will be concentrated and o n e-p oin ted / H aving taken himself as his authority, he abandons the unw holesom e and develops the wholesome; he abandons w hat is blam eworthy and develops what is blameless; he m aintains himself in purity.

 42 (2) Cases "Bhikkhus, in three cases one m ay be understood to have faith and confidence. W hat three? W hen one desires to see those of virtuous behavior; when one desires to hear the good Dhamma; and when one dwells at hom e with a m ind devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in relin­ quishm ent, devoted to charity, delighting in giving and shar­ ing. In these three cases, one m ay be understood to have faith and confidence."

 . One who desires to see the virtuous ones, w ho wishes to hear the good D ham m a, w ho has removed the stain of m iserliness, is called a person endow ed w ith faith. [151]

 .43 (3) Advantages '•Bhikkhus, w hen one sees three ad van tages, it is enough to teach others the Dhamma. W hat three? (1) The one w ho teaches the Dham m a experiences the m eaning and the D ham m a.403 (2) The one who hears the D ham m a experiences the m eaning and the Dhamma. (3) Both the one w ho teaches the D ham m a and the one w ho hears the D ham m a experience the m eaning and the D ham m a. Seeing these three advantages, it is enough to teach others the Dham m a."

 47'(7) Conditioned "Bhikkhus, there are these three characteristics that define the conditioned.405 W hat three? An arising is seen, a vanishing is seen, and its alteration while it persists is seen. These are the three characteristics that define the conditioned. "Bhikkhus, there are these three characteristics that define the unconditioned.406 W hat three? N o arising is seen, no vanishing is seen, and no alteration while it persists is seen. These are the three characteristics that define the unconditioned."

 48 (8) Mountains "Bhikkhus, based on the H im alayas, the king of mountains, great sal trees grow in three ways. W hat three? (1) They grow in branches, leaves, and foliage; (2) they grow in bark and shoots; and. (3) they grow in softwood and heartw ood. Based on the H im alayas, the king of mountains, great sal trees grow in these three ways. "So too, when the head of a family is endow ed with faith, the people in the family who depend on him grow in three ways.

 Just as the trees that grow in dependence on a rocky m ountain in a vast forest wilderness m ight become great "w oodland lords," so, w hen the head of a family here possesses faith and virtue, his wife, children/and relatives all grow in dependence upon him ; so too his friends, his family circle, and those dependent on him .

 Those possessed of discernm ent, . seeing that virtuous m an's good conduct, his generosity and good d e e d s ,. em ulate his example.

 H aving lived here in accord w ith D ham m a, the path leading to a good destination, those who desire sensual pleasures rejoice, delighting in the deva w orld.

(2) A rd or should be exercised for the arising of unarisen w holesom e qualities. (3) A rd or should be exercised for enduring arisen bodily feelings that are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, harrow ing, disagree­ able, sapping one's vitality. In these three cases ardor should be exercised. "W hen a bhikkhu exercises ardor for the. non-arising of u n ­ arisen bad unwholesome qualities, for the arising of unarisen w holesom e qualities., and for enduring arisenbodily feelings that are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, harrow ing, disagreeable, sapping one's vitality, he is called a bhikkhu w ho is ardent, alert, and mindful in order to m ake a com plete end of suffering."

Here, a m aster thief depends on the uneven, on thickets, and on powerful people. (1) "A n d how does a m aster thief depend on the uneven? H ere, a m aster thief depends on rivers that are hard to cross and rugged m ountains. It is in this way that a m aster thief depends on the uneven. (2) "A nd how does a m aster thief depend on thickets? Here, a m aster thief depends on a thicket of caney [154] a thicket o f . trees, a coppice,407 or a large dense jungle.

 Fools devoid of understanding, dull-witted, unlearned, do not attend on the holy ones417 but give their gifts to those outside.

They then heard the w anderer Sarabha m aking such a statement to an assembly in Rajagaha. W hen those bhikkhus had walked for alms in Rajagaha, after their m eal, w hen they returned from their alms round, they approached the Blessed One, paid hom ­ age to him, sat dow n to one side, and said to him: "Bhante, the w anderer Sarabha, who recently left this Dham ma and discipline, has been telling an assembly in Rajagaha: T have learned the D ham m a of the ascetics w ho follow the Sakyan son. After I learned their D ham m a, I left that Dhamma and discipline/ It w ould be good, Bhante, if the Blessed One w ould go to the w anderers' park on the bank of the Sappinika [river] and, out of com passion, approach the wanderer Sarabha." The Blessed One consented b y silence. Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and went to the w and erers' p ark on the bank of the Sappinika

 [saying:] "Just as an old jackal in a huge forest might think: 'I will roar a lion's ro ar,' and yet w ould only howl and yelp like a jackal, so, friend Sarabha, claim ing in the absence of the ascetic Gotama: 'I will roar a lion's ro a r/ [188] you only howled and yelped like a jackal.

 He should n ot train in faultfinding nor seize oh the other's mistakes; he should not overw helm and crush his opponent, nor speak m endacious w ords. Truly/a discussion am ong the good is for the sake of know ledge and confidence.

 70 (10) Uposatha Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One w as. dwelling at Savatthi in M igaram ata's M ansion in the Eastern Park. Then Visakha M igaram ata, on the d ay of the uposatha, approached the Blessed One, paid hom age to him , and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to her: "W hy, Visakha, have you com e in the m iddle of the day?" "Today, Bhante, I am observing the uposatha." "There are, Visakha, three kinds of uposathais. W hat three? The cow herds' uposatha, the N iganthas' uposatha,474 and the noble ones' uposatha. (1) "A nd how, Visakha, is the cow herds' uposatha observed? Suppose, Visakha, in the evening a cow herd returns the cows to their owners. He reflects thus: 'Today the cow s grazed in such and such a place and drank w ater in such and such a place. Tom orrow the cows will graze in such and such a place and drink w ater in such and such a place.' So too, som eone here observing the uposatha reflects thus: 'T oday I ate this and that food; today I ate a meal of this and that kind. [206] Tom orrow I will eat this arid thatfood; tom orrow I will eat a m eal Of this and that kind.' He thereby passes the day w ith greed and longing in his mind. It is in such a w ay that the cow herds' uposatha is observed. The cowherds' uposatha, thus observed, is not of great fruit and benefit, nor is it extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive. ' (2) "A nd how, Visakha, is the N iganthas' uposatha observed? There are, Visakha, ascetics called N iganthas. They enjoin their disciples thus: 'Com e, good m an, lay d ow n the rod tow ard living beings dwelling more than a hundred yojanas' distance

O n the uposatha day, they enjoin their disciples thus: 'C om e, good m an, having laid aside all clothes, recite: T am not anyw h ere the belonging of anyone, nor is there anywhere anything in any place that is m in e /476 H ow ever, his parents know: 'This is our so n / And he know s: 'These are my parents.'

And he knows: 'These are m y wife and ch ild ren / His slaves, workers, and servants know: 'H e is our m a s te r/ A nd he knows: 'These are m y slaves, w orkers, and servants.' Thus on an occasion w hen th ey should be enjoined in truthfulness, [the Niganthas] enjoin them in false speech. This, I say, is false speech. W hen that night has passed, he makes use of possessions that have not been given. This, I say, is taking w hat has not been given. It is in such a Way that the Niganthas' uposatha is observed. When one has observed the uposatha in the w ay of the Niganthas, the uposatha is n ot of great fruit and benefit, nor is it extraordinarily brilliant an d pervasive.

(2) N ext, he swiftly sows seeds. (3) A nd then he swiftly [240] irrigates and drains the field. These are the three urgent tasks of a farm er. "This farm er has no psychic potency or spiritual might [by which he could com m and]: 'Let m y crops start growing today! Let them m ature tom orrow ! Let them bear grain the day after tom orrow !' But, w ith the change of seasons, there comes a tim e when the crops grow , m ature, and bear grain. "SO too, bhikkhus, there are these three urgent tasks of a bhikkhu. W hat three? (1) The undertaking of the training in the higher virtuous behavior, (2) the undertaking Of the training in the higher m ind, and (3) the undertaking of the training in the higher w isdom .

"This bhikkhu has no psychic potency or spiritual m ight [by which he could com m and]: "Let m y mind be liberated from the taints by non-clinging today, or tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow!' Rather^ as this bhikkhu trains in the higher virtuous behavior, the higher m ind, and the higher wisdom, there com es an occasion w hen his m ind is liberated from the taints by non­ clinging. "Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'W e will have a keen desire to undertake the training in the

 93 (2) Solitude "Bhikkhus, w anderers of other sects prescribe these three kinds of solitude. W h at three? Solitude with respect to robes, solitude with respect to alm sfood, and solitude with respect to lodgings.535 "This, bhikkhus, is w hat w anderers of other sects prescribe as solitude with respect to robes: they w ear hemp robes, robes of hem p-m ixed cloth, sh rou d robes, rag-robes; robes m ade from tree bark., antelope hides, strips of antelope hide; robes of kusa grass, bark fabric, or w ood-shavings fabric; a blanket m ade of head hair or of anim al w ool, [241] a covering m ade of owls' wings.

"This is w hat w anderers of other sects prescribe as solitude with respect to alm sfood: they eat greens, millet, forest rice, hide-parings, m oss, rice bran, the scum of rice, sesam um flour, grass, or cow dung. They subsist on forest roots and fruits; they feed on fallen fruits. That is w hat w anderers of other sects prescribe as solitude w ith respect to alm sfood.... "This is w hat w anderers of other sects prescribe as solitude with respect to lodgings: a forest, the foot of a tree, a charnel ground, rem ote lodgings in forests and jungle groves, the open air, a heap of straw , a chaff-house. That is w hat w anderers of other sects prescribe as solitude with respect to lodgings. "These are the three kinds of solitude that wanderers of other sects prescribe. "In this D ham m a and discipline, bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of solitude for a bhikkhu. W hat three? "H ere, (1) a bhikkhu is virtuous; he has abandoned im m orality and remains secluded from it. (2) He holds right view; he has abandoned w rong view and rem ains secluded from it.536 (3) He is one whose taints are destroyed: he has abandoned the taints and remains secluded from them .

###### from it; when he is one w hose taints are destroyed, w ho has abandoned the taints and rem ains secluded from them , he is then called a bhikkhu w ho has attained the foremost, attained the core, one w ho is pure and established in the core. "Suppose, bhikkhus, there is a farm er whose field of hill rice has ripened: The farm er w ould swiftly have the plants cut. Then he would sw iftly have the plants collected. Then he w ould swiftly [242] have them transported [to the threshing place]. Then he would sw iftly pile them 'up, have them threshed, get the straw rem oved, get the chaff rem oved, and winnow it. Then he would swiftly h av e.it brought over, get it pounded, and get the husks rem oved. In this w ay, the farmer's grains of rice would be forem ost, attained the core, pure, and established in the core.

 95 (4) Assemblies "Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of assemblies.540 W hat three? The assembly of the forem ost, the divided assembly, and the harmonious assem bly. [243] (1) "A nd w hat, bhikkhus, is the assembly of the forem ost?

###### H ere, in this kind of assembly the elder bhikkhus do not become luxurious and lax, but discard backsliding and take the lead in solitude; they arouse energy for the attainm ent of the as-yet- unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. (Those in] the next generation follow their exam ple. They too do not becom e luxurious and lax, but discard backsliding and take the lead in solitude; they too arouse energy for the attainm ent of the as-yet- unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. This is called the assem­ bly of the foremost. (2) "A nd w hat is the divided assem bly? H ere, the assembly in w hich the bhikkhus take to arguing an d quarreling and fall into disputes, stabbing each other w ith piercing w ords, is called the divided assembly. (3) "A nd w hat is the harmonious assem bly? Here, the assem­ bly in which the bhikkhus dwell in concord, harmoniously, with­ out disputes, blending like milk and w ater, viewing each other w ith eyes of affection, is called the harm onious assembly. "W hen the bhikkhus dwell in concord, harm oniously, with­ out disputes, blending like milk and w ater, view ing each other w ith eyes of affection, on that occasion they generate m uch m erit. On that occasion the bhikkhus dw ell in a divine abode, that is, in the liberation of m ind through altruistic joy.. W hen one is joyful, rapture arises. For one w ith a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becom es concentrated. "Just as, when it is raining and the rain pours dow n in thick droplets on a mountain top, the w ater flow s dow n along the slope and fills the clefts, gullies, and creeks; these, becoming full, fill up the pools; these, becom ing full, fill up the lakes; these, becom ing full, fill up the stream s; these, becoming full, fill up the rivers; and these, becom ing full, fill up the ocean; so too, w hen the bhikkhus dwell in concord, harm oniously, with­ out disputes, blending like milk and w ater, view ing each other

M ahanam a the Sakyan heard: "The Blessed O ne has arrived at Kapilavatthu." Then M ahanam a the Sakyan approached the Blessed One, paid hom age to him, and stood to one side. The Blessed One then said to him; "G o, M ahanam a, and find a suitable rest house..in Kapila- vatthu where we m ight stay for the night." [277] "Yes, Bhante," M ahanam a replied. He then entered Kapila­ vatthu and searched the entire city but did not see a suitable! rest house where the Blessed O ne could stay for the night. So he returned tp the Blessed One and told him: "Bha.nte> there is no suitable rest house in K apilavatthu w here the Blessed One m ight stay for the night. But Bharandu the Kalama, form erly the Blessed One's fellow m onk, [is here].587 Let the Blessed One spend the night at his herm itage." "G o, M ahanam a, and prepare a m at for m e."

It then occurred to M ahanam a: "This is not a proper time for staying with the Blessed O ne, for he is tired. I will visit him tom orrow ." Then he paid hom age to the Blessed One, circum am ­ bulated him keeping the right side tow ard him, and departed. Then, w hen the night had passed, M ahanam a approached the Blessed One, paid hom age to him , and isat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him : "There are, M ahanam a, these three kinds of teachers found existing in the w orld. W hat three?

W hen this was said, Bharandu the Kalam a said to Mahanama: "Say the same, M ah an am a." But the Blessed One said to M ahanama: "Say different, M ahanam a." A second tim e. . . A third tim e Bharandu the Kalama said to M ahanama: "Say the sam e, M ahanam a." But the Blessed One said to Mahanama: "Say different, M ahanam a."

Then Bharandu the K alam a left Kapilavatthu. When he left .Kapilavatthu, he left for good and never returned.

 [while thinking:] "I will stand in front of the Blessed O ne," he sank down, descended, and could not rem ain in place. Just as ghee or oil, when poured on sand, sinks dow n, descends, and does not remain in place, so the young deva Hatthaka, [while thinking:] "I will stand in front of the Blessed O ne," sank down, descended, and could not rem ain in place. [279] Then the Blessed One said to H atthaka: "Create a gross body, H atthaka." "Y es, Bhante/' H atthaka replied. Then he created a gross body, paid hom age to the Blessed One, and stood to one side. The Blessed One then said to him : "Hatthaka, do those teachings that you could recall in the past, when you were a hum an being, com e back to you now ?"589 "Bhante, those teachings that I could recall in the past, when I was a human being, com e back to m e now ; and those teachings that I could not recall in the past, w hen I was a human being, come back to me now .590 Just as the Blessed One is now hemmed in by bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, m ale and female lay followers, kings

 "It would be good if you would abandon these three quali­ ties and stop attending to them. Instead, direct your mind to the deathless elem ent/' Some time later the Venerable A nuruddha abandoned those three qualities and stopped attending to them. Instead, he directed his mind to the deathless elem ent. Then, dwelling alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute, in no long time the Venerable Anuruddha realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansm en rightly go forth from the household life into hom elessness, and haying entered upon it, he dwelled in it. He directly knew: "D estroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, w hat had to be done has been dohe, there is no more coming back to any state of being." And the Venerable Anuruddha became one of the arahants.

 I.: B h a n d a g a m a

 1 ( 1 ) Understood Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One w as dwell­ ing am ong the Vajjis at Bhandagam a. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!" "Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:618 "Bhikkhus, it is because of n ot understanding and penetrating four things that you and I have roam ed and w an­ dered lor such a long stretch of lim e.619 W h at four? "It is, bhikkhus, because of not understanding and pene­ trating noble virtuous behavior, noble concentration, noble w isdom , and noble liberation that vou and I have roam ed and w andered for such a long stretch of time. "N oble virtuous behavior has been understood and pene­ trated. Noble concentration has been understood and pene­ trated. Noble wisdom has been u n d erstood and penetrated. Noble liberation has been understood and penetrated. Craving for existence has been cut off; the conduit to existence has been destroyed;620 now there is no m ore ren ew ed existence." This is whai the Blessed One said. H aving said this, the For­ tunate One, the Teacher, further said this: [2]

 "V irtuous behavior, concentration, w isdom , and unsurpassed liberation:

###### these things the illustrious Gotama understood by himself.

 "H aving directly known these things, the Buddha taught the Dhamma to the bhikkhus. The Teacher, the end-maker of suffering, the One w ith Vision, has attained nibbana."621

 2 (2) Fallen At Savatthi. "Bhikkhus, one who does not possess four things is said to have fallen from this Dhamma and discipline. W hat four? (1) One w ho does not possess noble virtuous behavior is said to have fallen from this Dhamma and discipline. (2) One who does not possess noble concentration. .. (3) One w ho does not possess noble w isd o m . .. (4) One who does not possess noble liberation is said to have fallen from this D ham m a.and discipline. One w ho does not possess these four things is said to have fallen from this Dhamma and discipline. "But, bhikkhus, one w ho possesses four things is said to be secure622 in this Dham m a and discipline. W hat four? (1) One who possesses noble virtuous behavior is said to be secure in this D ham m a and discipline. (2) One who possesses noble concentration . . . (3) One who possesses noble w isdom . . . (4) One w ho possesses noble liberation is said to be secure in this Dham m a and discipline. One who possesses these four things is said to be secure in this Dhamma and discipline."

 Collapsed an d fallen, they fall away; the greedy ones come back again. Done is the task, the delightful is delighted in; happiness is reached by happiness.623

 3 (3) Maimed (1) ' "Bhikkhus, possessing four qualities, the foolish, incom petent, bad person m aintains himself in a maimed and injured condi­ tion; he is blam ew orthy {3] and subject to reproach by the w ise; and he generates m uch demerit.

 H e w ho praises one deserving blame, or blam es one deserving praise, casts w ith his m outh an unlucky throw by w hich he finds no happiness.624

 Slight is the unlucky throw at dice that results in the loss bf one's wealth,
 [the loss] of all, oneself included; m uch w orse is this unlucky throw of harboring hate against the fortunate ones.625

H ere, with the atter destruction of the five lower fetters, som e person is of spontaneous birth, due to attain final nibbana there wi thout ever returning from that world. This is called the person who is inw ardly firm. (4) "A n d w h at is the one w ho has crossed over and gone beyond, the brahm in who stands on high ground? [6] H ere, w ith the destruction of the taints, some person has realized for him self w ith direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless lib­ eration of m ind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dw ells in ic.

###### repeatedly com ing back tob29 birth and old age, immersed in craving, are "the ones who go along with the stream ."

 Therefore a wise person w ith mindfulness established, not resorting to sense pleasures and bad deeds, should give up sense pleasures even if it's painful: they call this person "on e w ho goes against the stream ."

 One who has abandoned five defilements, a fulfilled trainee,630 unable to retrogress, attained to m ind's m astery,.his faculties composed: this person is called "on e inw ardly firm."

 One who has com prehended things high and low, burnt them up, so th ey're gone and exist no more:, that sage who has lived .the spiritual life, reached the w orld's end, is called "one who has gone beyond."

 6 (6) One of Little Learning "Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. W hat four? O ne of litde learning who is not intent on w hat he has learned; one of little learning who is intent on w hat he has learned; one of m uch learning who is not intent on w hat he has learned; and one of m uch learning who is intent on what he has learned.

H ere, som eone has learned m uch— that is, of the discourses . . . questions-and-answers— but he does not understand the m eaning of what he has learned; he does not understand the D ham m a; and he does not practice in accordance w ith the D ham m a. In such a way, a person is one of much learning w ho is not intent on w hat he has learned. (4) "And how is a person one .of m uch learning who is intent on what he has learned?

In such a w ay, a person is one of much learning w ho is intent on w hat he has learned. "These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of persons found exist­ ing in the w orld ."

 If one has little learning and is not settled in the virtues, they criticize him on both counts, virtuous behavior and learning.

 If one has little learning but is well settled in the virtues, ' they praise him for his virtuous behavior; his learning has su cceed ed /’32

 If one is highly learned but is not settled in the virtues, they criticize him for his lack of virtue; his learning has not succeeded. [8]

 If one is highly learned and is settled in the virtues, they praise him on both counts, virtuous behavior and learning.

###### When a disciple of the Buddha is highly learned, an expert on the D ham m a, endow ed with wisdom, like a coin of refined m ountain gold, who is fit to blame him ? Even the devas praise such a one; by Brahma too he is praised.

"Bhikkhus, these four kinds of persons who are com p e­ tent, disciplined, self-confident, learned, upholders of the Dhamma, practicing in accordance with the Dhamma, adorn the Sangha."

 One who is com petent and self-confident, learned, an expert on the D ham m a, practicing in accord w ith the Dham ma, is called an adornm ent of the Sangha.

 A bhikkhu accom plished in virtue, a learned bhikkhuni, a male lay follower endowedj w ith faith, a female lay follower endow ed with faith: these are the ones that adorn the Sangha; these are the Sangha's adornm ents.

(1) Here, a bhikkhu generates desire for the non-arising of unarisen bad unw holesom e states; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his m ind, and strives.

(4) H e generates desire for the persistence of arisen w holesom e states, for their non-decline, increase, expansion, and fulfillment by developm ent; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. These are the four right strivings."

 Those w ho strive rightly overcom e the realm of Ma«:a; they are unattached, <ione bevond fear of birth and death.

###### They are contented and unstirred, having conquered M ara and his mount; those happy ones have overcome all N am uci's arm ies.641 [16]

 14 (4) Restraint "Bhikkhus, there are these four strivings. W hat four? Striving by restraint, striving by abandonment, striving by develop­ m ent, and striving by protection. (1) "A n d w hat, bhikkhus, is striving by restraint? H ere, hav­ ing seen a form w ith the eye, a bhikkhu does not grasp its m arks and features. Since, if he left the eye faculty unrestrained, b ad . unw holesom e states of longing and dejection m ight invade him, he practices restraint over it, he guards the eye faculty, he under­ takes the restraint, of the eye faculty. H aving heard a sound with the e a r ... H aving slrieiled an odor with the nose . .. H aving tasted a taste with the tongue ... Having felt a tactile object w ith the body . . . H aving cognized a mental phenom enon w ith the m ind, a bhikkhu does not grasp its marks and features. Since, if he left the m ind faculty unrestrained, bad unw holesom e states of longing and dejection might invade him, he practices restraint over it, he guards the mind faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the m ind faculty. This is called striving by restraint. (2) "A n d w hat is striving by abandonment? H ere, a bhikkhu does not tolerate an arisen sensual thought; he abandons it, dis­ pels it, term inates it, and obliterates it. H e does not tolerate an arisen thought of ill w ill... an arisen thought of harm ing . . . bad unw holesom e states w henever they arise; he abandons them , dispels them , term inates them, and obliterates them . This is called striving by abandonment. (3) "A nd w hat is sM ving by development? H ere, a bhikkhu develops the enlightenm ent factor of m indfulness, w hich is based upon seclusion^ dispassion, and cessation, m aturing in release. H e develops the enlightenment factor of discrim ina­ tion of phenom ena ... the enlightenment factor of e n e rg y . . . the enlightenm ent factor of rap tu re... the enlightenm ent factor of tran q u ility. . . the enlightenment factor of con cen tration . . . the enlightenm ent factor'CJf equa nimity, which is based upon seclu­ sion, dispassion, and^eessation, m aturing in release.

###### (4) " A nd w hat is striving by protection? H ere, a bhikkhu pro­ tects an arisen excellent object of concentration:*42 the perception of a skeleton, the perception of a w orm -infested corpse, the perception of a livid corpse, the perception of a festering corpse, the perception of a fissured corpse,, the perception of a bloated corpse. This is called striving by protection. "These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of striving."

 Restraint and abandonment, developm ent and protection: these four strivings w ere taught by the K insm an of the Sun. By these m eans an ardent bhikkhu here can attain the destruction of suffering.

 15 (5) Proclamations\ "Bhikkhus, there are these four proclamations of the forem ost. W hat four? (1) "The forem ost of those with bodies is Rahu, lord of the asuras.643 (2) The forem ost of those who enjoy sensual pleasures is King M an d h ata/’44 (3) The foremost of those w ho exercise authority is M ara the Evil One. (4) In this w orld w ith its devas, M ara, and Brahm a, am ong this population w ith its ascetics and brahm ins, its devas and humans, the Tathagata, the A rahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One is declared forem ost. These are the four proclam ations of those who are forem ost."

 Rahu is the forem ost of those with bodies, M andhata, of those enjoying sense pleasures; M ara is the forem ost of rulers, blazing w ith pow er and glory. r

 In this w orld together with its devas above, across, and below, as far as the w orld extends, the Buddha is declared foremost.

 16 (6) Exquisiteness "Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of exquisiteness.645 W hat four? (1) H ere, a bhikkhu possesses suprem e exquisiieness of

H e does not perceive any other exquisiteness of volitional activities m ore excellent or sublim e than that one; he ddes not yearn for any other exquisiteness of volitional activities more excellent or sublime than that one. "These are the four kinds of exquisiteness."

 Haying know n the exquisiteness of form, the origination of feelings, how perception arises, and where it disappears; . having known volitional activities as alien, as suffering, and not as self, . truly that bhikkhu w ho sees rightly,646 peaceful, delights in the peaceful state. He bears his final body, having conquered M ara and his mount.

 17 (7) Wrong Courses (1) "Bhikkhus, there are these four w ays of taking a w rong course* W hat four? One takes a w rong course because of desire, because; of hatred, because of delusion, or because of fear. These are the four w ays of taking a w rong course."

The Blessed One said this: "Bhikkhus, on one occasion I w as dwelling at Uruvela, by the goatherds' banyan tree on the bank of the Neranjara River, just after I had attained full enlightenm ent.

 23 (3) The World "Bhikkhus, the Tathagata has fully aw akened to the world;655 the Tathagata is detached from the w orld. The Tathagata has fully aw akened to the origin of the w orld; the Tathagata has abandoned the origin of the w orld. The Tathagata has. fully aw akened to the cessation of the w orld ; the Tathagata has realized the cessation of the w orld. The Tathagata has fully aw akened to the way leading to the cessation of the w orld; the T athagata has developed the w ay lead in g to the cessation of the w orld. (1) "Bhikkhus, in this w orld w ith its devas, M ara, and Brahm a, am ong this population w ith its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, w hatever is seen, heard, sensed, cog­ nized, reached, sought after, [24] exam ined by the mind— all that the Tathagata has fully aw akened to; therefore he is called the Tathagata.656 .

 He is the Blessed One, the Buddha, he is the lion unsurpassed; in this world with its devas, he set in motion the w heel of Brahm a.

 Thus those devas and hum an beings w ho have gone for refuge to the Buddha assemble and pay hom age to him , the great one free from diffidence:

 "Tam ed, he is the best of tam ers; peaceful, he is the seer am ong peace-bringers; freed, lie is the chief of lib erators; crossed over, he is the best of guides across. ''

"Thus, bhikkhus, being ever stable among things seen, heard, sensed, and cognized, the Tathagata is a stable one.667 And, I say, there is no stable one m ote excellent or sublime than that stable one."

 25 (5) The Spiritual Life "Bhikkhus, this spiritual life is not lived for the sake of deceiv­ ing people and cajoling them ; nor for the benefit of gain, honor, and praise; nor for the benefit of winning in debates; nor w ith the thought; "Let the people know me th u s/ But rather, this spiritual life is lived for the sake of restraint, abandoning, dis- passion, and cessation."1370

 The Blessed One taught the spiritual life, not based on tradition, culminating in nibbana, . . lived for the sake of restraint and abandoning.6/1 .

 This is the path of the great beings,672 the p ath follow ed by the great seers. Those w ho practice it as taught by the Buddha, acting upon the Teacher's guidance, will m ake an end of suffering.

 26 (6) Deceivers673 (1) "Bhikkhus, those bhikkhus who are deceivers, stubborn, talk­ ers, im posters, haughty, and unconcentrated are not bhikkhus of m ine.674 (2) They have strayed from this D ham m a and disci­ pline, and they do not achieve grow th, progress, and m aturity in this D ham m a and discipline. (3) But those bhikkhus w ho are honest, sincere, steadfast, compliant, and well concentrated are bhikkhus of m ine. (4) They have not strayed from this D ham m a and discipline, and they achieve growth, progress, and m atu­ rity in this D ham m a and discipline."

 Those w ho are deceivers, stubborn, talkers, im posters, haughty, unconcentrated, do n ot m ake progress in the Dhamma that the Perfectly Enlightened One has taught.

 27 (7) Contentment ''Bhikkhus, there are these four trifles, easily gained and blam e­ less. W hat four? (1) "A rag-robe is a trifle among robes,- easily gained [27] and blameless. (2) A lum p of almsfood is a trifle am ong m eals, eas­ ily gained and blam eless. (3) The foot of a tree is a trifle am ong lodgings, easily gained and blameless. (4) Putrid urine is a trifle among m edicines, easily gained, and blameless.675 "These are the four trifles, easily gained and blameless. W hen a bhikkhu is satisfied with what is trifling and. easily gained, I say that he has one of the factors of the ascetic life."

 W hen one is content w ith what is blameless, trifling and easily gained; w hen one's m ind is not distressed because of a lodging, robe, drink, and food, one is not hindered anywhere.676

 These qualities, rightly said to conform to the ascetic life/ are acquired by a bhikkhu677 who is content and heedful.

 28 (8) Noble Lineages678 - "Bhikkhus, there are these four noble lineages, prim al, of long standing, traditional, ancient, unadulterated and never before adulterated, w hich are not being adulterated and will not be adulterated, w hich are not repudiated by wise ascetics and brahmins. W hat four? (1) "H ere, a bhikkhu is content with any kind of robe, and he speaks in praise of contentment with any kind of robe, and he does not engage in a Wrong search, in what is im proper, for the sake of a robe.679 If he does not get a robe he is not agitated, and if he gets one he uses it without being tied to it, infatuated

Any bhikkhu w ho is skillful in this, diligent, clearly com prehending and ever m indful, is said to be standing in an ancient, primal noble lineage.

For what reason? Because he is a steadfast one w ho vanquishes discontent and delight."

 Discontent does not vanquish the steadfast one,681
 [for] the steadifast one is not vanquished by discontent,682 The steadfast one vanquishes discontent, for the steadfast one is a vanquisher, of discontent. [29]

 Who can obstruct the dispeller who has discarded all kam m a? Who is fit. to blam e one w ho is like a coin of refined gold? Even.the devas praise such a one; by Brahma too he is praised.

 31 (1) The Wheel "Bhikkhus, there are these four w heels. W hen these four wheels turn, those devas and hum ans w ho possess them soon attain greatness and abundance of w ealth: W hat four? Dwell ing in a suitable locality, relying on good persons, right resolution, and merits done in the p ast.680 These are the four wheels. When these four wheels turn, those d evas and hum ans who possess them soon attain greatness and abundance of wealth."

 When a person dw ells in a suitable locality and makes friends w ith the noble ones, when he has form ed right resolutions, and done deeds of m erit in the past, grain, riches, fam e, and reputation, along w ith happiness accrue to him.

 32 (2) Sustaining "Bhikkhus, there are these four m eans of sustaining a favorable relationship. WhaL fou r? G iving, endearing speech, beneficent conduct, and im partiality.6*7 These are the four means of sus taining s favorable relationship."

###### Giving, endearing speech, beneficent conduct, and im partiality under diverse worldly conditions, as is suitable to fit each case: these m eans of sustaining a favorable relationship are like the linchpin of a rolling chariot.

 If there were no such means of sustaining a favorable relationship, neither m other nor .father w ould be able to obtain esteem  . and veneration from their children.

 But since there exist these m eans of sustaining a favorable relationship, wise people respect them; thus they attain to greatness . . and are highly praised. [33]

 33 (3) The Lion "Bhikkhus, in the evening the iion, the king of beasts, comes out from his lair, stretches his body, su rveys the four quarters all around, and roars his lion's roar three tim es. Then he sets out in search of game. "W hatever animals hear the lion roaring for the m ost part are filled with fear, a sense of urgency, and terror. Those who live in holes enter their holes; those w ho live in the w ater enter the w ater; those who live in the w oods enter the w oods; and the birds resort to the sky. Even those royal bull elephants, bound by strong thongs in the villages, tow ns, and capital cities, burst and break their bonds asunder; frightened, they urinate and defecate and flee here and there. So pow erful am ong the ani­ m als is the lion, the king of beasts, so m ajestic and mighty. "So too, bhikkhus, when the Tathagata arises in the world, an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accom plished in true knowl ­ edge and conduct, fortunate, know er of the w orld, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tam ed, teacher of devas and hum ans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One, he teaches the Dhamma thus: "(I) Such is personal existence, (2) su ch the origin of per­ sonal existence, (3) such the cessation of personal existence, (4)

###### "W hen those devas who are long-lived, beautiful, abounding in happiness, dwelling for a long tim e in lofty palaces, hear the Tathagata's teaching of the D ham m a, for the m ost part they are filled w ith fear, a sense of urgency, and terror thus:689 Tt seems that we are actually impermanent, though w e thought ourselves perm anent; it seems that we are actually transient, though we thought ourselves everlasting; it seem s that w e are actually non-eternal, though we thought ourselves eternal. It seems that we are impermanent, transient, hon-eternal, included in personal existence/690 So pow erful is the Tathagata, so majestic and m ighty is he in this world together w ith its devas." [34]

 W hen, through direct know ledge, the Buddha, the teacher, the peerless person in this world with its devas, . sets in motion the wheel of D ham m a,
 [he teaches] personal existence/its cessation, the origin of personal existence, and the noble eightfold path that leads to the calming dow n of suffering.

 Then even those devas with long life spans— beautiful, ablaze with glory— becom e fearful and filled w ith terror, like beasts who hear the lion's roar. "It seem s that we are im perm anent, n o t beyond personal existence/' [they say], wrhen they hear the w ord of the A rahant, the Stable Gne who is fully freed.

[35] Those who have confidence in the Sangha have confidence in the foremost, and for those who have con­ fidence in the foremost, the result is forem ost.

 for one entirely detach ed from lust, liberated by the. destruction of craving, such seeking has been relinquished, and viewpoints are uprooted.

 That peaceful, m indful bhikkhu, tranquil, undefeated, enlightened by breaking through conceit, is called "one w ho has draw n back."

W hen they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat dow n to one side and said to the Blessed One: "Does Master G otam a praise sacrifice?" "I do not praise all sacrifice, brahm in, nor do 1 withhold praise from all sacrifice. (1) I do not praise a violent sacrifice at w hich cattle, goats, ram s, chickens, and pigs are slain, at w hich'vari­ ous creatures are led to slaughter. (2) For w hat reason? Because arahants and those w ho have entered the path to arahantship do not attend a violent sacrifice.

 The great seers of right conduct do not attend a sacrifice where goats, ram s, cattle, and various creatures are slain. .

 But when they regularly offer by family custom sacrifices free from violence, no goats, sheep, and cattle or various creatures are slain.

 That is the sacrifice the great seers of right conduct attend. The wise person should offer this; this sacrifice.is very fruitful.

 For one w ho m akes such sacrifice it is indeed better, never worse. Such a sacrifice is truly vast and the deities too are pleased.

 40 (10) Udayl Then the brahmin U dayl approached the Blessed O n e ... and said to him:
 [The prose portion is identical with that of 4:39.]

 When a sacrifice is tim ely and allowable, well prepared and nonviolent, [44] the self-controlled follow ers of the spiritual life attend such a sacrifice as thig.

(4) "A nd what is the developm ent of concentration that leads to the destruction of the taints? H ere, a bhikkhu dwells contem­ plating arising and vanishing in the five aggregates subject to clinging: 'Such is form, such its origin, such its passing away; such is feeling ... such is p ercep tion . . . such are volitional activ­ ities .., such is consciousness, such its origin, such its passing aw ay.' This is the developm ent of concentration that leads to the destruction of the taints. "These are the four developm ents of concentration. And it w as writh reference to this that I said in the Parayana, in 'The Questions of Punnaka':

 "H aving comprehended the w orld 's highs and lows, he is not perturbed by anything in the world. [46] Peaceful, fumeless, untroubled, w ishless, he has, I say, crossed over birth and old ag e."721

 One kind is given a categorical answ er, another is answered after m aking a distinction; to the third, one should raise a counter-question, but the fourth should be set aside.

 W hen a bhikkhu knows how to answ er each type in the appropriate w ay, they say that he is skilled ; \ in the four kinds of questions.

 He is hard to. attack, hard to defeat, deep, hard to assault; . he is. proficient in both what is beneficial and harmful.

 The wise person avoids w hat is harm ful, and takes up what is beneficial. By arriving at what is beneficial, the steadfast one is said to be wise.

 43 (3) Anger (1) "Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found exist­ ing in the world. W hat four? (1) One w ho values anger, not the good Dhamma; (2) one who values denigration, not the good Dham m a; (3) one who values gain, not the good Dham ma; and (4) one who values honor, not the good D ham m a. These are the four kinds of persons found existing in the w orld. "There are, bhikkhus, these four [other] kinds of persons found existing in the world. W hat four?

 But those who value the good D ham m a, who dwelled thus in the past and dwell thus now, truly grow in the Dhamma taught by the Perfectly Enlightened One.

(1) Valuing anger, not the good Dhamma; (2) valuing denigration, not the good D ham m a; (3) valuing gain, not the good Dham ma; and (4) valuing honor, not the good Dham m a.

[49]

 The end of the world can never be reached by means of traveling [across the w orld ]; yet without reaching the w orld 's end there is no release from suffering.

 46 (6) Rohitassa (2) Then w hen that night had passed, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, last night, when the night had advanced, the young deva Rohitassa, of stunning beauty, illum inating the entire Jeta's G rove, approached me, paid hom age to m e, stood to one side, and said:. "'Is it possible, Bhante, by traveling to know , see, or reach the end of the w orld, where one is not born, does not grow old and die, does not pass aw ay and get reborn?'"
 [W hat follow s is identical with 4:45, including the verses, b u t . spoken in the first-person narrative voice.] [50]

 47 (7) Far Apart "Bhikkhus,. there are these four pairs of things extrem ely far apart. W hat four? (1) The sky and the earth. (2) The near and the far shores of the ocean. (3) The place w here the sun rises and the place w here it sets. (4) The teaching of the good and the teaching of the bad. These are the four pairs of things extrem ely far ap art." [51]

 The sky and the earth are far apart, the ocean's far shore is said to be far, and sO the place where the sun rises from the place w here it sets.

 But even farther apart, they say, are the teachings of the good and the bad.726 The com pany of the good is constant; so long as it endures, it is just the same. But the com pany of the bad is fickle; thus the teaching of the good is far from the bad.

Then, in the evening, the Blessed One em erged from seclu­ sion and approached the assem bly hall. H e sat dow n on the appointed seat and addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, who has been instructing, exhorting, inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus in the assem bly hall with a.

It is good that you instruct, exhort, inspire, and gladden the bhikkhus in the assem bly hall w ith a D ham m a talk, [spoken] w ith speech that is polished, clear, articulate, expressive of the meaning, com prehensive, and u n hindered."

 W hen the wise m an is in the m idst of fools, they do not know him if he does not speak.728 But they know him w hen he speaks, teaching the deathless state.

 Perceiving perm anence in the im perm anent, percei ving pleasure in what is suffering, perceiving a self in what is non-self, and perceiving attractiveness in w hat is unattractive, beings resort to w rong views,731 their m inds deranged, their perception twisted.

 Such people are bound by the yoke of M ara, and do not reach security from bondage. Beings continue in sam sara, going to birth and death.

###### Mother and father are called "Brahm a," and also "first teachers." They are w orthy of gifts from their children, for they have com passion for their offspring. Therefore a w ise person should revere them and treat them w ith honor.

 One should serve them w ith food and drink, with clothes and bedding, by m assaging and bathing them, and by w ashing their feet.

 Because of that service to mother and father, the wise praise one in this w orld . . and after death one rejoices in heaven. [71]

 64 (4) Hell753 "Bhikkhus,.one w ho possesses four qualities is cast into hell as if brought there. W h at four? H e destroys life, takes w hat is not given, engages in sexual m isconduct, and speaks falsely. One who possesses these four qualities is cast into hell as if brought there."

 The destruction of life, taking w hat is not given, the uttering of false speech, and consorting w ith others' wives: the wise do not praise such deeds.

 65 (5) Form ‘ "Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found exist­ ing in the w orld. W h at four? (1) One w ho judges on the basis of form , w hose con fid en ce is based on form.

 One w ho does not know the inside and does not see the outside, ' a fool obstructed on all sides, is carried aw ay by speech.

 Beings enam ored of tantalizing things, seeking delight in w hatever is pleasing, low beings bound by delusion,756 increase their bondage.

"I enjoin you, bhikkhus, to pervade these four royal families of snakes with a mind of loving-kindness, for your own secu­ rity, safety, and protection."

 I have loving-kindness for the viriipakkha snakes; for the erapatha snakes I have loving-kindness. I have loving-kindness for the chabyaputta snakes; for the black gotamakas I have loving-kindness.

 68 (8) Devadatta O n one occasion the Blessed O ne w as dw elling at Rajagaha on M ount Vulture Peak soon after D evadatta had left.761 There the Blessed One, with reference to D evadatta, addressed the bhik­ khus: "Bhikkhus, D evadatta's gain, honor, and praise led to his ow n ruin and destruction. (1) Just as a plantain tree yields fruit to its ow n ruin and destruction, so D evad atta's gain, honor, and praise led to his own ruin and destruction. (2) Just as a bam­ boo yields fruit to its own ruin and destruction, so Devadatta's gain, honor, and praise led to his ow n ruin and destruction. (3) just as a reed yields fruit to its ow n ruin and destruction, so D evadatta's gain, honor, and praise led to his Own ruin and destruction. (4) Just as a m ule becom es p regnan t to its own ruin and destruction, so D evadatta's gain, honor, and praise led to his ow n ruin and destruction."

 As its own fruit destroys the plantain, as its fruit destroys the bam boo and reed, as its em bryo destroys the m ule, so does honor destroy the vile m an. [74]

H ere, a bhikkhu gen­ erates desire for the maintenance of arisen wholesome qualities, for their non-deciine, increase, expansion, and fulfillment by developm ent; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his m ind, and strives. This is called striving by protection. "These are the four strivings."

 Restraint and abandonm ent, development and protection: by means of these four strivings taught by the Kinsman of the Sun a bhikkhu who is ardent here can attain the destruction of suffering.

 111 (1) Kesi Then Kesi the horse trainer approached the Blessed One, paid hom age to him, and sat dow n to one side. The Blessed One then said to him: "Kesi, you are reputed to be a horse trainer. Just how do you discipline a horse to be tam ed?" "Bhante, I discipline one kind of horse gently, another kind sternly, and still another kind both gently and sternly." "But, Kesi, if a horse to be tam ed by you w on't submit to dis­ cipline by any of these m ethods,‘how do you deal with him ?" "Bhante, if a horse to be tam ed by m e w on't submit to disci­ pline by any of these methods, then I kill him. For what reason? So that there will be no disgrace to m y teacher's guild.

However, w hen a person to be tam ed w on't submit to discipline by the gentle m eth od , the stern m ethod, or the m ethod that is both gentle and stern, then the Tathagata thinks he should not be spoken to and instructed, and his w ise fellow m onks, too, think he should n ot be spoken to and instructed.

###### Possessing these four factors, a w arrior is worthy of a king, an accessory of a king, and reckoned a factor of kingship.

What four? H ere, a bhikkhu is skilled in places, a long-distance shooter, a sharp-shooter, and one w ho splits a great body. ' (1) "A nd how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu skilled in places? Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dw ells restrained by the Patimokkha, . possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. H aving undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. It is in this w ay that a bhikkhu is skilled in places. (2) "A nd how is a bhikkhu a long-distance shooter? Here, any kind of form w hatsoever— w hether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near— a bhikkhu sees all form as it really is with correct wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not m y self/ Any kind of feeling w hatsoever. . . A ny kind of perception whatso­ ever ... Any kind of volitional activities whatsoever ... Any kind of consciousness w hatsoever— w hether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near— a bhikkhu sees all consciousness as it really is with cor­ rect w isdom thus:/This is n o t m ine, this I am not, this, is not m y self/ It is in this w ay that a bhikkhu is a long-distance shooter. (3) "A nd how is a bhikkhu a sharp-shooter? Here, a bhikkhu understands as it really is: 'This is suffering/ He understands as it really is: 'This is the origin of su fferin g/ He understands as it really is: 'This is the cessation of suffering/ He understands as it really is: 'This is the w ay leading to the cessation of suffering/ It is in this w ay that a bhikkhu is a sharp-shooter. (4) "A nd how is a bhikkhu one w ho splits a great body? Here, a bhikkhu splits the great m ass of ignorance. It is in this w ay that a bhikkhu is one who splits a great body. "Possessing these four qualities, a bhikkhu is w orthy of gifts, w orthy of hospitality, w orthy of offerings, w orthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of m erit for the w orld."

 183 (3) Heard On one occasion the Blessed O ne w as dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. Then the brah­ min Vassakara, the chief m inister of M agadha, approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings w ith him  Then, sitting to one side, he said to the Blessed One: "M aster Gotama, I hold the thesis and view that there is no fault when one speaks about the seen, saying: 'Such was seen by m e'; no fault when one speaks about the heard, saying: 'Such was heard by m e'; no fault w hen one speaks about the sensed, saying: 'Such w as sensed by m e'; no fault when one speaks about the cognized, saying: 'Such w as cognized by m e.'"

(4) A nd still another kind of person does not torm ent him self or pursue the practice of. torturing himself, [206] and does not torm ent others or. pursue the practice of. torturing others. Since he torm ents neither himself nor others, in this very life he dwells hungerless, quenched and cooled, experiencing bliss, having himself become divine.928 (1) "A n d how , bhikkhus, is a person one w ho torm ents him ­ self and pursues the practice of torturing him self?929 H ere, a certain pers.on goes naked, rejecting conventions, licking his hands, not com ing w hen asked, not stopping w hen asked; he does not accep t food brought or food specially m ad e o r an invitation to a m eal; he receives nothing from a p ot, from a bow l, across a threshold, across a stick, across a pestle, from tw o eating together, from a pregnant w om an, from a w om an nursing a child, from a w om an being kept by a m an , from w here food is advertised to be distributed, from w here a dog is w aiting, from where, flies are buzzing; he accepts no fish or m eat, he drinks no liquor, wine, or fermented brew .

Suppose I shave off my hair and beard, put on ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness.' On a later occasion, having abandoned a sm all or a large fortune, having abandoned a small or a large circle of relatives, he shaves off his hair,and beard, puts on ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness.

 1 (1) In Brief Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed O ne w as dwell­ ing at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!" "V enerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this: "Bhikkhus, there are these five trainee's pow ers.974 W hat five? The p ow er of faith, the pow er of m oral sham e, the pow er of m oral dread, the pow er of energy’ and the p ow er of wisdom . These are the five trainee's powers. Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'W e will possess the pow er of faith, a trainee's pow er; we will possess the p ow er of m oral sham e, a trainee's pow er; w e will possess the p ow er of m oral dread, a trainee's pow er; we will possess the p ow er of energy, a trainee's pow er; w e will possess the pow er of w isdom , a trainee's pow er.' Thus, bhikkhus, should you train you rselves." [This is w hat the Blessed One said. Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed O ne's statem ent.]975 [2]

This is called the pow er of faith. (2) "A nd w hat is the pow er of m oral shame? H ere, a noble disciple has a sense of m oral sham e; he is ashamed of bodily, verbal, and m ental m isconduct; he is asham ed of acq u irin g . evil, unw holesom e qualities.

###### 7 (7) Sensual Pleasures "Bhikkhus, beings for the m ost part are captivated by sen­ sual pleasures. W hen a clansm an has forsaken the sickle and carrying-pole and gone forth from the household life into hom e- lessness, he can be described as a clansm an who has gone forth out of faith. For w hat reason? Sensual pleasures, w hether of this or that kind, can be obtained by a youth. Inferior sensual pleasures, m iddling sensual pleasures, and superior sensual pleasures are all reckoned sim ply as sensual pleasures. [6] "Suppose a young infant boy, ignorant, lying on his back, were to put a stick or pebble in his m outh because of his.nurs.e's heedlessness. His nurse w ould quickly attend to him and try to take it out. If she could not quickly take it out, she w ould brace the boy's head w ith her left hand and, hooking a finger of her right hand, she w ould take it out even if she had to draw blood. For w hat reason? There w ould be some distress for the. boy-—this I don't deny— but the nurse has to do so for his good and welfare, out of com passion for him. However, w hen the boy has grown up and has enough sense, the nurse w ould be unconcerned about him , thinking: 'The boy can now look after himself. He w on't be h eed less/ "So too, so long as a bhikkhu is still not accomplished in faith in [cultivating] w holesom e qualities, in a sense of shame in
 [cultivating] w holesom e qualities, in m oral dread in [cultivat­ ing] wholesome qualities, in energy in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, and in w isdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, I must still look after him . But w hen that bhikkhu is accom ­ plished in faith in [cultivating] w holesom e qualities..... accom ­ plished in w isdom in [cultivating] wholesom e qualities, then I am unconcerned about him , thinking: 'The bhikkhu can now look after himself.

 14 (4) In Detail "Bhikkhus, there are these five pow ers. W hat five? The pow er of faith, the power of energy, the p o w e r of mindfulness, the pow er of concentration, and the p ow er of wisdom. (1) "A nd what;bhikkhus, is the p ow er of faith? Here, a noble disciple is endowed w ith faith. H e places faith in the enlight­ enm ent of the Tathagata thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened... [as in 5 :2 ] ... the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' [11] This is called the pow er of faith. (2) "A nd what is the pow er of energy? H ere, a noble disciple has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesom e qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating w holesom e qualities. This is called the power of energy.

###### (3) "A nd what is the p ow er of m indfulness? Here, the noble disciple is mindful, possessing suprem e mindfulness and alert­ ness, one who rem em bers and recollects w hat was done and said long ago. This is called the pow er of mindfulness. (4) "A nd what is the pow er of concentration? Here, secluded from sensual pleasures, seclud ed from unwholesom e states, a bhikkhu enters and dw ells in the first jhana, which con­ sists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and exam ination.. W ith the subsiding of thought and examination, he enters and dw ells in the. second jhana, which has internal placidity an d unification of mind and con­ sists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration, without thought and exam ination. W ith the fading aw ay as well of rapture, he dwells equanim ous and, m indful and clearly com ­ prehending, he experiences pleasure w ith the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhana of w hich the noble ones declare: 'H e is equanimous, m indful, one w ho dwells happily/ W ith the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing aw ay of joy and dejection, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhana, neither painful n or pleasant, which has purifica­ tion of mindfulness by equanim ity. This is called the power of concentration. (5) "A nd what is the. p ow er of w isdom ? H ere, a noble dis­ ciple is wise; he possesses the w isdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and' penetrative and leads to the com plete destruction of suffering. This is called the power of wisdom . ' ' - "These, bhikkhus, are the five p ow ers."

 29 (9) Walking Meditation "Bhikkhus, there are these five benefits of w alking meditation. W h at five?

 30 (10) Nagita Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was w andering on tour among the Kosalans together w ith a large Sangha of bhikkhus when he reached the K osalan brahmin vil­ lage nam ed Icchanangala. There the Blessed One dwelled in the Icchanangala woodland thicket. The brahm in household­ ers of Icchanangala heard: "It is said that the ascetic Gotam a, the son of the Sakyans who w;ent forth from a Sakyan fam ­ ily, has arrived at Icchanangala and is now dw elling in the Icchanangala woodland thicket.

"Bhante, these are the brahmin householders of Icchanahgala w ho have brought abundant food of various kinds.

 31 (1) Sumana On one occasion the Blessed One w as dw elling at SavatthI in Jeta's G rove, Anathapindika's Park. Then Princess Sum ana,1000 acco m p an ied by five hundred ch ariots and five hundred cou rt girls, approached the Blessed O ne, paid hom age to him, and sat dow n to one side. Princess Sum ana then said to the Blessed One: "H ere, Bhante, there might be tw o disciples of the Blessed One equal in faith, virtuous behavior, and w isdom , but one is generous while the other is not. W ith the breakup.of the body;
 [33] after death, they would both be reborn in a good desti­ nation, in a heavenly world. W hen they have becom e devas, w ould there be any distinction or difference betw een them ?" "There w ould be, Sumana," the Blessed.One said. "The gen­ erous one, having become a deva, w ould surpass the other in five w ays: in celestial life span, celestial beauty, celestial happi­ ness, celestial glory, and celestial authority. The generous one, having becom e a deva, would surpass the other in these five w ays." "B u t, Bhante, if these two pass aw ay from there and again becom e hum an beings, would there still be som e distinction or difference between them ?" "T here w ould be, Sum ana," the Blessed O ne said. "W hen they again become human beings, the generous one would sur­ pass the other in five ways: in hum an life span, hum an beauty, hum an happiness, hum an tame, and hum an authority. When they again becom e human beings, the generous one would sur­ pass the other in these five w ays." "But- Bhante, if these two should go forth from the household life into homelessness, would there still be som e distinction or difference between them?" "T here w ould be, Sum ana," the Blessed One said. "The gen­ erous one, having gone forth, w ould surpass the other in five w ay s.1001 (1) He w ould usually use a robe that has been specifi­ cally offered to him, seldom one that had n ot been specifically

They .would usually present him w hat is agreeable, seldom £34] w hat is disagreeable. The generous one, having gone forth, w ould surpass the other in these five w ays." "But, Bhante, if both attain arahantship, would there still be some distinction or difference between them after they have attained arahantship?" . • "In this case, Sum ana, I declare, there w ould be no differ­ ence betw een the liberation [of one] and the liberation [of the other]." "It's astounding and am azing, Bhante! Truly, one has good reason to give alm s and do meritorious deeds, since they will be helpful if one becom es a deva, [again] becom es a hum an being, or goes forth." "So it is, Sum ana! So it is, Sumana! Truly, one has good rea­ son to give alm s and do meritorious deeds, since they will be helpful if one becom es a deva, [again] becomes a hum an being, or goes forth." This is w hat the Blessed One said. H aving said this, the For­ tunate O ne, the Teacher, further said this:

 "A s the stainless m oon m oving through the sphere of space outshines w ith its radiance all the stars in the w orld, so one accom plished in virtuous behavior, a person endow ed with faith, outshines by generosity all the m isers in the world.

 32 (2) Cundi™3 On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bam boo G rove, the squirrel sanctuary. Then Princess Cundi,1004 accom panied by five hundred chariots and five hun­ dred court girls, approached the Blessed One, paid hom age to. him, and sat dow n to one side. Princess Cundi then said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, m y brother is Prince Cunda. He says thus: 'W hen­ ever a m an or a w om an has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the D ham m a, and the Sangha, and abstains from the destruc­ tion of life, from taking w hat is not given, from sexual m iscon­ duct, from false speech, and from indulging in liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn only in a good destination, not in a bad destination.' I ask the Blessed One: 'W h at kind of teacher, Bhante, should one have confidence in, so that, w ith the breakup of the body, after death, one is reborn only in a good destination, not in a bad destination? W hat kind of D ham m a should one have confidence in, so that, with the breakup of the body, after death, one is reborn only in a good destination, not in a bad destination?

 33 (3) .Uggaha On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Bhaddiya in the Jatiy a G rove. Then U ggaha, M endaka's grandson, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him , sat dow n tc one side, and said to the Blessed One: "B hante, let the Blessed One together w ith three other m onks1008 consent to accept tom orrow 's [37] m eal from m e /' The Blessed One consented by silence.

Then, w hen the night had passed, in the m orning the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and w ent to U ggaha's residence, w here he sat dow n on the appointed seat. Then, with his oWn hands, U ggaha, M endaka's grandson, served and satis­ fied the Blessed One with various kinds of delicious food. W hen the Blessed O ne had finished eating and had put away his bowl, U ggaha sat dow n to one side and said to the Blessed One: "B h an te, these girls of mine will be going to their hus­ bands' families. Let the Blessed One exhort them and instruct them in a w ay that will lead to their welfare and happiness foi a long tim e."

###### The Blessed One then said to those girls: (1) "So then, girls, you should train yourselves thus: T o w hichever husband our parents give us— doing so out of a desire for our good, seeking our w elfare, taking compassion on us, acting out of compassion for us— w e will rise before him and retire after him, undertaking w hatever needs to be done, agree­ able in our conduct and pleasing in our speech.' Thus should you train yourselves.

"W hen, girls, a w om an possesses these five qualities, with the breakup of the body, after death, she is reborn in companion­ ship w ith the agreeable-bodied d ev as."1009

 She does not despise her husband, the man. who constantly supports her, w ho ardently and eagerly always brings her w hatever she w ants.

 34 (4) Slha On one occasion the Blessed O ne w as dwelling at Vesall in the hall with the peaked roof in the G reat W ood. Then Slha the general approached [39] the Blessed O ne/p aid homage to him, sat dow n to one side, and said:1011 "Is it possible, Bhante, to point out a directly visible fruit of giving?"1012 ■ "It is, Slha/' the Blessed O ne said. (1) "A donor, Slha, a m unificent giver, is dear and agreeable to m any people. This is a directly visible fruit of giving. (2) "Again, good persons resort to a donor, a munificent giver. This, too, is a directly visible fruit of giving. (3) "Again, a donor, a m unificent giver, acquires a good repu­ tation. This, too, is a directly visible fruit of giving. (4) "Again, w hatever assem bly a donor, a munificent giver, approaches-—whether of khattiyas, brahm ins, householders, or ascetics— he approaches it confidently and com posed.1013 This too is a directly visible fruit of giving. (5) "Again, with the breakup of the body, after death, a donor, a munificent giver, is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. This is a fruit of giving pertaining to future lives."1014 W hen this was said, Slha the general said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, I do not go by faith in the Blessed One concerning those four d irectly visible fruits of giving declared by him. I know them, too. For l am a donor, a m unificent giver, and I am dear and agreeable to m any people. I am a donor, a munifi­ cent giver, and many good persons resort tQ me. I am a donor,

###### a munificent giver, and I have acquired a good reputation as a donor, sponsor, and su p p orter of the Sangha. I [40] am a donor, a munificent giver, and w hatever assembly I approach— whether of khattiyas, brahm ins, householders, or ascetics— I approach it confidently and com posed. I do not go by faith in the Blessed One concerning these four directly visible fruits of giving declared by him. I know them , too. But when the Blessed One tells me: 'Slha, with the breakup of the body, after death, a donor, a munificent giver, is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly w orld / I do not know this, and here I go b y faith in the Blessed O ne." "So it is, Slha, so it is! W ith the breakup of the body, after death, a donor, a munificent giver, is reborn in a good destina­ tion, in. a heavenly w orld."

 . By giving, he becomes dear and m any resort to him. He attains a good reputation and his fame increases! The generous m an is com posed and confidently enters the assembly.

 Therefore, seeking happiness, wise persons give gifts, having rem oved the stain of miserliness. W hen they are settled in the triple heaven, for a long time they delight in companionship w ith the devas.

 Having taken the opportunity to do wholesome deeds, passing from here, self-lum inous, they roam in N andana/015 where they delight, rejoice, and enjoy themselves, furnished with the five objects of sensual pleasure. Having fulfilled the w ord of tlie unattached Stable One, the Fortunate One's disciples rejoice in heaven. [41]

 35 (5) The Benefits of Giving "Bhikkhus, there are these five benefits of giving. W hat five? (1) One is dear and agreeable to m any people. (2) Good persons resort to one. (3) One acquires a good reputation. (4) One is


-----

###### not deficient in the layperson's duties. (5) With the breakup of the body, after death, one is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. These are the five benefits in giving."

 By giving, one becom es dear, one follows the duty of the good; the good self-controlled m onks always resort to one.

 They teach one the D ham m a that dispels all suffering, having understood w hich the taintless one here attains nibbana.

 ■36 (6) Timely "Bhikkhus, there are these five tim ely gifts. W hat five? (1) One gives a gift to a visitor. (2) One gives a gift to one setting out on a journey. (3) One gives a gift to a patient. (4) One gives a gift during a famine. (5) O ne first presents the newly harvested crops and fruits to the .virtuous ones. These are the five timely gifts."

 A t the proper tim e, those wise, charitable, and generous folk give -a timely gift to the noble ones, who are stable and upright; given with a clear m ind, one's offering is vast.

 Those who rejoice in such deeds or who provide [other] service do not miss out on the offering; they too partake of the m erit.

 Therefore, with a non-regressing mind, one should give a gift w here it yields great fruit. Merits are the su pport of living beings
 [when they arise] in the other w orld. [42]

###### 37 (7) Food "Bhikkhus, a donor who gives food gives the recipients five things. W hat five? One gives life, beauty, happiness, strength, and discernm ent.1016 (1) Having given life, one partakes of life, w hether celestial or human. (2) H aving given beauty, one par­ takes of beauty, whether celestial or hum an. (3) H aving given happiness, one partakes of happiness, w hether celestial or hum an. (4) H aving given strength, one partakes of strength, w hether celestial or human. (5) H aving given discernm ent, one partakes of discernment, whether celestial or hum an. A donor w ho gives food gives the recipients these five things."

 The wise one is a giver of life, strength, beauty, and discernment. The intelligent one is a donor of happiness and in turn acquires happiness.

 H aving given life, strength, beauty, happiness, and discernment, one is long-lived and famous w herever one is reborn.

 38 (8) Faith "Bhikkhus, these five benefits com e to a' clansm an endow ed w ith faith. W hat five? (1) W hen the good persons in the world show com passion,1017 they first show com passion to the person w ith faith, not so to the person w ithout faith. (2) W hen they ap p roach anyone, they first approach the person w ith faith, n ot so the person without faith. (3) W hen they receive alms, they first receive alms from the person w ith faith, not so from the person w ithout faith. (4) W hen they teach the Dham m a, they first teach the Dhamma to thp p erson w ith faith, not so to the person w ithout faith. (5) W ith the breakup of the body, after death, a person with faith is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. These are the five benefits that com e to a clansm an w ho has faith. . . "Ju st as at a crossroads on level grou n d , a great banyan tree becom es the resort for birds all arou nd , so [43] the clans­ m an endow ed with faith becomes the resort for m any people:

 A large tree with a m ighty trunk, branches, leaves, and fruit, firm roots, and bearing fruit, is a support for many birds. . H aving flown across the sky, the birds resort to this delightful base: those in need of shade partake of its shade; those needing fruit enjoy its fruit.

 Just so, when a person is virtuous, endow ed with faith, of humble manner, compliant, gentle, welcoming, soft, those in the world who are. fields of m erit— devoid of lust and hatred, devoid of delusion, taintless— resort to such a person.

 They teach him the D ham m a that dispels all suffering, having understood which the taintless one here attains nibbana.

 39 (9) Son "Bhikkhus, considering five prospects, m other and father wish for a son to be bom in their family. W h at five? (1) 'H aving been supported by us, he will support us. (2) O r he will do work for us. (3) O ur family lineage will be extended. (4) H e will m anage the inheritance, (5) or else, when we have passed on, he will give an offering on our behalf/ C onsidering these five prospects, m other and father wish for a son to be born in their fam ily."

 Considering the five prospects, w ise people wish for a son. "Supported by us, he will support us, or he will do work for us.

###### The family lineage will be extended, he will m anage the inheritance, or else, when we have passed on, he will make an offering on our behalf."

 Considering these prospects, w ise people wish for a son. Therefore good persons, grateful and appreciative, support their mother and father, recalling how they helped one in the past; [44] they do w hat is necessary for them as they did for oneself in the past.

 Follow ing their advice, nurturing those who brought him up, , continuing the family lineage, endow ed with faith, virtuous: this son is worthy of praise.

 40 (10) Sal Trees1018 "Bhikkhus, based on the H im alayas, the king of m ountains, great.sal trees grow in five ways. W hat five? (1) They grow in branches, leaves, and foliage; (2) they g row in bark; (3) they growr in shoots; (4) they grow in softw ood; and (5) they grOw in heartw ood. Based on the H im alayas, the king of mountains, great sal trees grow in these five w ays.

###### so, w hen the head of a family here possesses faith and virtue, his wife, children, and relatives all grow in dependence on him ; so too his companions, his fam ily circle, and those dependent on him.

 Those possessed of discernm ent, seeing that virtuous m an's good conduct, his generosity and.good deeds, . . em ulate his example.

This is the fifth utilization of wealth. "T hese, householder, are the five utilizations of w ealth.

 "I'Ve enjoyed w ealth, supported m y dependents, and overcom e adversities. I have given an uplifting offering, and perform ed the five oblations. I have served the virtuous monks, the self-controlled celibate ones.

 "I have achieved w hatever purpose a wise person, dwelling at home, m ight have in desiring wealth; w hat I have done brings me no regret."

 42 (2) The Good Person "Bhikkhus, w hen a good person is born in a fam ily, it is for the good , w elfare, and happiness of m any people. It.is for the good, w elfare, and happiness of (1) his m other and father, (2) his w ife and children, (3) his slaves, w orkers, and servan ts, (4) his friends and com panions, and (5) ascetics and brahm ins. Just as a g reat rain cloud, nurturing all the crops, appears for the good, w elfare, and happiness of m any people, so too, [47] w hen a good p erson is born in a fam ily, it is for the good, w elfare, and happiness of m any people. It is for the good, w el­ fare, an d happiness of his m other and father ... . ascetics and b rahm ins."

 The deities protect one guarded by the D ham m a,1021 w ho has m anaged his wealth for the w elfare of m any. Fam e do.es not forsake one steadfast in the D ham m a, w ho is learned and of virtuous behavior and observances.

 W ho is fit to blam e him, standing in D ham m a, accom plished in virtuous behavior, a speaker of truth, possessing a sense of shame,
 [pure] like a coin of refined gold? E ven the devas praise him; by B rahm a, too, he is praised.

 43 (3) Wished For Then the householder Anathapindika approached the Blessed One, paid hom age to him, and sat dow n to one side. The Blessed One then said to him : "H ouseholder, there are these five things that are w ished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the w orld. W hat five?

These are the five things that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the w orld.1022 "These five things, householder, that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world, I say, are not obtained by m eans of prayers or aspirations. If these five things that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the w orld could be obtained by m eans of prayers [48] or aspirations, w ho here w ould be lacking in anything? (1) "H ouseholder, the noble disciple w ho desires long life ought not to pray for long life or delight in it or [passively] yearn for it.'023 A noble disciple who desires long life should practice the w ay conducive to long life.1024 For when he practices the. w ay conducive to long life, it leads to obtaining long life, and he gains long life either celestial or human. (2) "H o u se h o ld e r, the noble disciple w h o d esires beauty . . . ( 3 ) . . . w ho desires happiness . . . ( 4 ).. . w ho desires fame ought not to pray for fame or delight in it or [passively] yearn for it. A noble disciple who desires fame should practice the w ay conducive to fame. For when he practices the w ay con­ ducive to fam e, it leads to obtaining fame, and he gains fame either celestial or human. (5) "H ouseholder, the noble disciple who desires the heavens ought not to p ray for the heavens or delight in them or [pas­ sively] yearn for them. A noble disciple w ho desires the h eav­ ens should practice the w ay conducive to heaven. For w hen he practices the w ay conducive to heaven, it leads to obtaining the heavens, and he gains the heavens."1025

 For one desiring long life, beauty, fame,1026 acclaim , heaven, high families, and lofty delights following in succession, the wise praise heedfulness in doing deeds of merit. [49]

 Being heedful, the wise person secures both kinds of good: the good in this life,

 44 (4) The Giver of the Agreeable On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesall in the hall w ith the peaked roof in the Great W ood. Then, in the m orn­ ing, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and w ent to the residence of the householder Ugga of Vesall, w here he sat dow n in the appointed seat. Then the householder U gga of Vesall app roach ed the Blessed One, paid hom age to him , sat dow n to one side, and said to the Blessed One: "B h an te, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learned this: "The giver of w^hat is agreeable gains w hat is agree­ ab le/ Bhante, m y sal flower porridge is agreeable.1028 L et the Blessed O ne accept it from m e, out of com passion."

Although I know this is not allowable for the Blessed One, this sandalwood plank of mine is worth over a thousand.1031 Let the Blessed One accept it from me, out of com passion." The Blessed One accepted, out of compassion. Then the Blessed One expressed his appreciation to the householder Ugga of Vesali thus:

 /'The giver of the agreeable gains the agreeable, when he gives willingly to the upright ones clothing, bedding, food, and drink, and various kinds of requisites.

 "H aving known the arahants to be like a field

###### the good person gives w hat is hard to give: the giver of agreeable things gains w hat is agreeable."

 Then, after expressing his appreciation to the householder Ugga of Vesali, the Blessed One rose from his seat and left. Then, some time later, the householder U gga of Vesali passed aWay. After his death, the householder U gga of Vesali w as reborn among a certain group of m ind-m ade [deities].1033 On that occa­ sion the Blessed One w as dw elling at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. Then, w hen the night had advanced, the young deva U gga, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire
 [51] Jeta's Grove, approached the Blessed One, paid hom age to him, and stood to one side. The Blessed One. then said to him: "I hope, Ugga, that it is as you w ould have wished." "Surely, Bhante, it is as I had w ished." Then the Blessed One addressed the young deva U gga w ith verses:

 "The giver of the agreeable gains the agreeable; the giver of the forem ost again gains the foremost; the giver of the excellent gains the excellent; the giver of the best reaches the best state.

"Bhikkhus, just as it is not easy to m easure the water in the great ocean thus: 'There are so m any gallons of w ater,' or 'There are so m any hundreds of gallons of w a te r/ or. 'There are so m any thousands of gallons of w a te r/1936 or 'There are so m any hundreds of thousands of gallons of w a te r/ but rather it is reck­ oned simply as an incalculable, im m easurable, great mass of water; so too, w hen a noble disciple possesses these five streams of merit... it is reckoned sim ply as an incalculable, im m easur­ able, great m ass of m erit." .

 Just as the m any rivers used by the hosts of people, flowing dow nstream , reach the ocean, the great m ass of w ater, the boundless sea, the fearsome receptacle of heaps of gems; [53] so the stream s of m erit reach the wise m an who is a giver of food, drink, and cloth;

Here, a noble disciple abstains from the destruction of life, abstains from taking what is not given, abstains from sexual m iscon­ duct, abstains from false speech, abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. This is called the w ealth of virtuous behavior. (3) "And what is the w ealth of learning?

Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the m iddle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, w hich proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life— such teachings as these he has learned much of, retained in m ind, recited verbally, mentally investigated, and penetrated well by view /037 (4) "And what is the w ealth of generosity? Here, a noble disciple dwells at hom e w ith a heart devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in relin­ quishment, devoted to charity/ delighting in giving and shar­ ing.

Here, a noble dis­ ciple is wise; he possesses the w isdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. This is called the wealth of wisdom. "These, bhikkhus, are the five kinds of wealth." [54]

 When one has faith in the Tathagata,1033 unshakable and w ell established, and virtuous behavior that is good, loved and praised by the noble ones; when one has confidence in the Sahgha and one's view has been straightened out, they say that one is not poor, that one's life is not lived in vain.

[68] [The Blessed.O ne said:]. "Bhikkhus, did that foolish m an think:'A mother does not fall in love with her son, or a .son With his m other'?

 These five objects of sensual pleasure are seen in a w om an's body: forms, siounds, tastes, and odors, and also delightful touches.

 Those swept up by the flood of sensuality, who do not fully understand sense pleasures, are plunged headlong into sam sara, [into] time, destination, and existence upon existence,1055

 But those w ho have fully understood sense pleasures live without fear from any quarter. Having attained the destruction of the taints, while in the w orld, they have gone beyond.

 56 (6) Preceptor T hen a certain bhikkhu ap p roach ed his own preceptor and said to him: ''Bhante, m y b od y now seem s as if it has been drugged, I have becom e disoriented, and the teachings are no longer clear to me.

Then, having received such an exhortation from the.Blessed One, that bhikkhu rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circum am bulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed. Then, dwelling alone, withdrawn,heedful,ardent, and resolute, in no long tim e that bhikkhu realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed con­ summation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having entered upon it, he dw elled in it. He directly knew: "Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no m ore coming back to any state of being." And that bhikkhu becam e one of the arahants. Then, after attaining arahantship, that bhikkhu approached his preceptor and said to him : "B hante, m y body now no longer seems as if it had been d ru gged , I have becom e well oriented, and the teachings are clear to m e. Dullness and drowsiness do not obsess m y m ind. I live the spiritual life joyfully and have no doubt about the teachings." Then the preceptor took his pupil to the Blessed One.

"Bhikkhus, a talk is properly addressed w hen, having w eighed one type of person against another, it is addressed to these five [appropriate] types of persons."

 171 (1) Timidity On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta's G rove, A nathapindika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!7' "Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this: "Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a lay follower is over­ come by tim idity. W hat five? He destroys life, takes w hat is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, speaks falsely, and indulges iri liquor, w ine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedless­ ness. Possessing these five qualities, a lay follower is overcom e by timidity. "Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities^ a lay follower is self- confident. W hat five? He abstains from the destruction of life, abstains from taking w hat is n ot given, abstains from sexual m isconduct, abstains from false speech, abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Possessing these five qualities, a lay follower is self-confident."

 172 (2) Self-Confidence "Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a lay follower dwells w ith­ out self-confidence at hom e. W hat five? [204] He destroys life, takes w hat is not given, engages in sexual m isconduct, speaks falsely, and indulges in liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Possessing these five qualities, a lay follower dwells w ithout self-confidence at home. "Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a lay follower dw ells self-confident at hom e. W hat five? He abstains from the destruc­ tion of life, abstains from taking what is not given, abstains from sexual m isconduct, abstains from false speech, abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. P os­ sessing these five qualities, a lay follower dwells self-confident at hom e."

 273 (3) Hell "Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a lay follower is depos­ ited in hell as if brought there. WTiat five? He destroys life, takes w hat is not given, engages in sexual m isconduct, speaks

###### falsely, and indulges in liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Possessing these five qualities, a lay follower is deposited in hell as if brought there. "Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a lay follower is depos­ ited in heaven as if brought there. W hat five? He abstains from the destruction of life, abstains from taking w hat is not given, abstains from sexual m isconduct, abstains from false speech, abstains from liquor, w ine, and intoxicants, the basis for h eed ­ lessness. Possessing these five qualities, a lay follower is depos­ ited in heaven as if brought there." .

 174(4) Enmities Then the householder Anathapindika approached the Blessed One, paid hom age to him , and sat dow n to one side. The Blessed One then said to him : . ."H ouseholder, w ithout having abandoned five perils and enmities, one is called im m oral and is reborn in hell. W h at five? The destruction of life, taking what is not given, sexual m isconduct, false speech, and [indulging in] liquor, w ine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. [205] W ithout having abandoned these five perils and enmities, one is called im m oral and is reborn in hell. "H ouseholder, having abandoned five perils and enm ities, one is called virtu ous and is reborn in heaven. W hat five? The destruction of life . . . and [indulging in] liquor, w ine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Having abandoned these five perils and enm ities, one is called virtuous and is reborn in heaven. ' (1) "H ouseholder, one w ho destroys life thereby engenders peril and enm ity pertaining to the present life and the future life, and also experiences m ental pain and dejection. O ne w ho abstains from the destruction of life does not engender peril and enm ity pertaining to the present life and the future life, nor does he experience m ental pain and dejection. For one w ho abstains from the destruction of life, that peril and enm ity has thus subsided. (2) "H o u seh old er, one w ho takes w hat is n ot g iv e n . .. (3 )... engages in sexual m iscon d u ct... (4) . . . speaks falsely . .. ( 5 ) ... indulges in liquor, w ine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, thereby engenders peril and enmity pertaining to

###### the present life and the future life, and also experiences m ental pain and dejection. One w ho abstains from liquor, w ine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, does not engender peril and enm ity pertaining to the present life and the future life, nor does he experience mental pain and dejection. For one w ho abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heed­ lessness, that peril and enm ity has thus subsided." ,

 There's a m an in the w orld who destroys life, speaks falsely, ahd takes what is not given, w ho goes to the w ives of others, and indulges in liquor and wine.

 Harboring w ithin the five enmities, he is called im m oral. W ith the breakup of the body, that unwise person is reborn in hell.

 But there is a m an in the world who does not destroy life, speak falsely, take w hat is not given, go to the w ives of others, [206] or indulge in liquor and wine.

 H aving abandoned the five enmities, he is called virtuous. W ith the breakup of the body, that wise person is reborn in heaven.

 175 (5) Candala "Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a lay follower is a candala of a lay follower, a stain of a lay follower, the last am ong lay fol­ low ers.1170 W hat five? (1) He is devoid of faith; (2) he is im m oral; (3) he is superstitious and believes in auspicious signs, not in kamma; (4) he seeks outside here for a person w orthy of offer­ ings;1171 and (5) he first does [meritorious] deeds there. Possessing these five qualities, a lay follower is a candala of a lay follower, a stain of a lay follow er, the last among lay followers. "Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a lay follower is a gem of a lay follower, a red lotus of a lay follower, a white lotus of a

Possessing these five qualities, a lay follower is a gem of a lay follow er, a red lotus of a lay follower, a w hite lotus of a lay follow er."

 176 (6) Rapture Then the h ouseholder Anathapindika; accom panied by five hundred lay follow ers, approached the Blessed One, paid h om ­ age to him , and sat dow n to one side. The Blessed One then said to the householder Anathapindika. [and his retinue]: "H ouseholders, you have presented robes, alm sfood, lodg­ ings, and m edicines and provisions for the sick to the Sangha of bhikkhus. Y ou should not be content merely with this m uch,
 [thinking]: 'W e have presented robes, almsfood, lodgings, and m edicines and provisions for the sick to the Sangha of bhik­ khus.' Therefore, householders, you should train yourselves thus: [207] 'H ow can w e from time to time enter and dw ell in the rapture of solitude?'1173 It is in such a w ay that you should train you rselves." .When this w as said, the Venerable Sariputta said to the Blessed One: "It's astounding and amazing, Bhante, how well that w as said by the Blessed One. Bhante, w henever a n ob le, disciple enters and dwells in the rapture of solitude, on that occasion five things do not occur in him. (1) Pain and dejection connected w ith sensuality do not occur in him. (2) Pleasure and joy connected w ith sensuality do not occur in him. (3) Pain and dejection connected with the unwholesome do not occur in him. (4) Pleasure and joy connected with the unw holesom e do not occur in him . (5) Pain and dejection connected w ith the w hole­ some do not occu r in him. Bhante, whenever a noble disciple enters and dw ells in the rapture of solitude, on that occasion these five things do not occur in him ." "G ood, good, Sariputta! Sariputta, w henever [208] a noble disciple enters and dw ells in the rapture of solitude . : . [The Buddha repeats in full the entire statement of the Venerable Sariputta, d ow n to :]. . . on that occasion these five things do not occur in h im "

 178 (8) Kings (1) "Bhikkhus, w hat do you think?

 279 (9) A Layman. Then.the h ou seholder Anathapindika, accom panied by five hundred lay follow ers, approached the Blessed O ne, paid hom age to him , and sat dow n to one side.

(4) "Again,, the noble disciple possesses unw avering confi­ dence in. the Sangha thus: 'The Sangha of the Blessed O ne's disciples is practicing the good way, practicing the straight way, practicing the true w ay, practicing the proper w ay; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individual— this Sangha of the Blessed O ne's disciples is worthy of gifts, w orthy of hospitality, w orthy of offerings, worthy of reverential saluta­ tion, the unsurpassed field of merit for the w orld / This is the third pleasant visible dwelling that pertains to the higher m ind, which he has achieved [213] for the purification of the im pure mind, for the cleansing of the unclean mind.

 H aving seen the peril in the hells, one should avoid evil deeds;

###### 794 The Book of the Fives III 214

 having undertaken the noble Dhamma, the w ise one should avoid them.

 To the utm ost of one's ability, one should not injure living beings; one should not knowingly speak falsely; one should not take what is not given.

 One should be content with one's own w iv es/174 and should refrain from the wives of others.1175 A person should not drink wine and liquor, w hich cause m ental confusion.

 One should recollect the Buddha and ponder on the Dhamma. One should develop, a benevolent mind, w hich leads to the world of the devas.

 W hen things to be given are available, for one needing and wanting merit1176 an offering becom es vast if first given to the holy ones.

 I will describe the holy ones, Sariputta, listen to m e.1177 [214] A m ong cattle of any sort, w hether black, white, red, or golden, m ottled, uniform , or pigeon-colored, the tam ed bull is born, the one that can bear the load, possessing strength, advancing with good speed. They yoke the burden just toihim; they are n ot concerned about his color. So too, am ong hum an beings it is in any kind of birth— am ong khattiyas, brahmins, vessas, suddas, candalas, or scavengers— am ong people of any sort that the tam ed person of good manners is born: one firm in Dfiamma virtuous in conduct

###### one w ho has abandoned birth and death, consum m ate in the spiritual life, w ith the burden dropped, detached, w ho has done his task, free of taints; w ho has gone beyond all things [of the w orld] and by non-clinging has reached nibbana: an offering is truly vast w hen planted in that spotless field.

 Fools devoid of understanding, dull-w itted, unlearned, do not attend on the holy ones but give their gifts to those outside. Those, how ever, w ho attend on the holy ones, on the wise ones esteemed as sagely, and those w hose faith in the Fortunate One is deeply rooted and well established, go to the w orld of the devas or are born here in a good family. A dvancing in successive steps, those w ise ones attain nibbana.

 1.80.(10) Gavesi On one occasion the Blessed One was w andering on tour am ong the K osalans together with a large Sahgha of bhikkhus. Then, while traveling along the highway, the Blessed O ne saw a large sal-tree grove in a certain place. He left the highw ay, entered the sal-tree grove, and smiled when he reached a certain place. Then it occurred to che Venerable Ananda: "W h y  did the Blessed O ne smile? Tathagatas do not smile without a reason." Then the V enerable Ananda [215] said to the Blessed One: "W iry, Bhante, did the Blessed One smile? Tathagatas do not smile without a reason."

 1(1) Worthy of Gifts (1) Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One w as dw ell­ ing at SaVatthi in Jeta's G rove, Anathapindika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!" "Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this: "Bhikkhus, possessing six qualities, a bhikkhu is w orthy of gifts, w orthy of hospitality, w orthy of offerings, worthy of rev ­ erential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the w orld. W hat six? (1) H ere, h avin g seen a form w ith the eye, a bhik­ khu is neither joyful n or saddened, but dwells equanim ous, mindful, and clearly com p reh en d in g.1251 (2) Having heard a sound with the ear, a bhikkhu is neither joyful nor saddened, but dwells equanim ous, m indful, and clearly com prehend­ ing. (3) H aving sm elled an odor w ith the nose, a bhikkhu is neither joyful nor sad den ed , but dwells equanimous, m indful, and clearly com p reh en d in g. (4) H aving experienced a taste with the tongue, a bhikkhu is neither joyful nor saddened, but dwells equanim ous, m indful, and clearly com prehend­ ing.

Possessing these six qualities, a bhikkhu is w orthy of gifts, w orthy of hospitality, w orthy of offerings, w orthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of m erit for the w orld." This is w hat the Blessed One said. Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed O ne's statement. [280]

 2 (2) Worthy of Gifts (2) "Bhikkhus, possessing six qualities, a bhikkhu is w orthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, w orthy of offerings, worthy of rev­ erential salutation, an unsurjpassed field of merit for the world. What six?1252 (1) "H ere, a bhikkhu w ields the various. kinds of psychic potency: having been one, he becom es m any; having been many, he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he goes unhin­ dered through a wall, through a ram part, through a mountain as though through space; he dives in and out of the earth as though it w ere W ater; he walks on w ater without sinking as though it w ere earth; seated cross-legged, he travels in space like a bird; with his hand he touches and strokes the m oon and sun so pow erful and m ighty; he exercises mastery with the body as far as the brahm a world. (2) "W ith the divine ear elem ent, which is purified and sur­ passes the hum an, he hears both kinds of sounds, the divine and human, those that are far as well as near. (3) "H e understands the m inds of other beings and persons, having encom passed them with his own mind. He understands a mind with lust as a m ind w ith lust and a mind without lust as a mind w ithout lust; a m ind with hatred as a mind with hatred and a m ind w ithout hatred as a mind without hatred; a mind with delusion as a m ind with delusion and a mind w ith­ out delusion as a m ind w ithout delusion; a contracted m ind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted; an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted; a sur­ passable mind as surpassable and an unsurpassable mind as unsurpassable; a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated m ind as unconcentrated; a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated. (4) "H e recollects his m anifold past abodes, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty [281] births, a hundred

(5) "W ith the divine eye, w hich is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing aw ay and being reborn* infe­ rior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortu­ nate, and he understands how beings fare in accordance w ith their kamma thus: 'These beings who engaged in m isconduct by body, speech, and m ind, w ho reviled the noble ones, held wrong view, and undertook kam m a based on wrong view, with the breakup Of the body, after death, have been reborn in the plane of m isery, in a bad destination, in the lower w orld, in hell; but these beings w ho engaged in good conduct by body, speech, and m ind, w ho did not revile the noble ones, who held right view, and undertook kam m a based on right view, with the breakup of the b od y, after death, have been reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly w o rld / Thus with the divine e}'e, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings faire in accordance w ith their kamma.

But this seeing is low, com ­ mon, w orldly, ignoble, and unbeneficial; it does not lead to disenchantm ent, dispassion, cessation, peace, direct know l­ edge, enlightenm ent, and [326] nibbana.

###### 35 (5) Pertain to True Knowledge "Bhikkhus, these six things pertain to true knowledge. W hat six? The perception of im perm anence, the perception, of suf­ fering in the impermanent, the perception of non-self in. what is suffering, the perception of abandoning, the perception of dispassion, and the perception of cessation.1306 These six things pertain to true knowledge."

 36 (6) Disputes "Bhikkhus, there are these six roots of disputes. W hat six? (1) "H ere, a bhikkhu is angry and hostile. W hen a bhikkhu is angry and hostile, he dwells w ithout respect and deference tow ard the Teacher, the D ham m a, and the Sahgha, and he does not fulfill the training. Such a bhikkhu creates a dispute in the Sangha that leads to the harm of m any people, to the unhappi­ ness of m any people, to the ruin, harm , and suffering of devas and humans. If, bhikkhus, you perceive an y such root of dispute either in yourselves or in others, you should strive to abandon this evil root of dispute. And if| you d o n ot perceive any such root of dispute either in yourselves or in others, you should practice so that this evil root of dispute does not em erge in the future. [335] In such a w ay this evil root of dispute is abandoned and does not emerge in the future. (2) "A gain, a bhikkhu is a denigrator and in so len t... ( 3 )... envious and m iserly ...

###### quishes them with difficulty. W hen a bhikkhu adheres to his own views, holds to them tenaciously, and relinquishes them with difficulty, he dwells w ithout respect and deference toward the Teacher, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and he does not ful­ fill the training. Such a bhikkhu creates a dispute in the Sahgha that leads to the harm of m any people, to the unhappiness of m any people, to the ruin, harm , an d suffering of devas and hum ans. If, bhikkhus, you perceive an y such root of dispute either in yourselves or in others, you should strive to aban­ don this evil root of dispute. A nd if y ou do not perceive any such root of dispute either in yourselves or others, you should practice so that this evil root of dispute does not emerge in the future. In such a way this evil root of dispute is abandoned and does not emerge in the future. "These, bhikkhus, are the six roots of dispute." [336]

 37 (7) Giving On one occasion the Blessed One w as dw elling at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. N ow on that occasion the female lay follower Velukantaki N an d am ata had prepared an offering possessed Of six factors for the Sahgha of bhikkhus headed by Sariputta and M oggallana. W ith the divine eye, w hich is purified and surpasses the hum an, the Blessed One saw the female lay follower Velukantaki N andam ata preparing this offering and he then addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, the female lay follow er Velukantaki Nandamata is preparing’an offering possessed of six factors for the Sahgha of bhikkhus headed by Sariputta and M oggallana. And how is an offering possessed of six factors? H ere, the donor has three factors and the recipients have three factors. "W h at are the three factors of the donor? (1) The donor is joyful before giving; (2) she has a placid, confident mind in the act of giving; and (3) she is elated after giving. These are the three factors of the donor. "W h at are the three factors of the recipients? H ere, (4) the recipients are devoid of lust or are practicing to rem ove lust; (5) they are devoid of hatred or are practicing to rem ove hatred; (6) they are devoid of delusion or are practicing to rem ove delu­ sion. These are the three factors of the recipients. "Thus the donor has three factors, an d the recipients have


-----

###### three factors. In such a way the offering possesses six factors. It is not easy to measure the merit of such an offering thus: 'Just so m uch is the stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, nutrim ent of happiness— heavenly, ripening in happiness, con­ ducive to heaven— that leads to what is wished for, desired, and agreeable, to one's welfare and happiness7; rather, it is reck­ oned sim ply as an incalculable, im m easurable, great m ass of merit. Bhikkhus, just as it is not easy to m easure the w ater in the great ocean [337] thus: 'There are so m any gallons of w ater/ . o r/T h ere are so m any hundreds of gallons of w a te r/ or 'There are so m any thousands of gallons of w a te r/ or 'There are so m any hundreds of thousands of gallons of w a te r/ but rather it is reckoned simply as an incalculable, im m easurable, great ; m ass of w ater; so tod, it is hot easy to m easure the m erit of such an o fferin g .... rather, it is reckoned simply as an incalculable, im m easurable; great mass of m erit/'

 Prior to giving one is joyful; while giving one settles the mind in trust; after giving one is elated: this is success in the act of offering.

 W hen they are devoid of lust and hatred, devoid of delusion, without taints, self-controlled, living the spiritual life, the field for the offering is complete.

 H aving cleansed oneself1307 and given with one's own hands, the act of charity is very fruitful for oneself and in relation to others.

 H aving perform ed such a charitable deed w ith a mind free from miserliness, the w ise person, rich in faith, is reborn in a happy, non-afflictive w orld.

 4 5 (3 ) Debt (1) "Bhikkhus, isn't poverty suffering in the w orld for one who enjoys sensual pleasures?" "Yes, Bhante " (2) "If a poor, [352] destitute, indigent person gets into debt, isn't his indebtedness, too, suffering in the w orld for one who enjoys sensual .pleasures?" "Y es, Bhante." (3) "If a poor, destitute, indigent person w ho has gotten into debt prom ises to pay interest, isn't the interest, too, suffering in the w orld for one who enjoys sensual pleasures?" "Y es, Bhante." (4) "If a poor, destitute, indigent person w ho has prom ised to pay interest cannot pay it when it falls due, they reprove him. Isn't being reproved, too, suffering in the w orld for one w ho enjoys sensual pleasures?" "Y es, Bhante." (5) "If a poor, destitute, indigent person w ho is reproved does nOt pay, they prosecute him. Isn't prosecution, too, suffering in the w orld for one who enjoys sensual pleasures?" "Yes, Bhante."

"Y es, Bhante." "So, bhikkhus, for one who enjoys sensual pleasures, poverty is suffering in the world; getting into debt is suffering in the w orld; having to pay interest is suffering in the w orld; being reproved is suffering in the world; prosecution is suffering in the w orld; and imprisonment is suffering in the w orld.

 P o v erty is called suffering in the w orld; so too is getting into debt. A p o o r person w ho becomes indebted is troubled while enjoying himself

###### Then they prosecute him and he also incurs imprisonment. This im prisonm ent is indeed suffering for one yearning for gain and sensual pleasures.

 Just so in the Noble O ne's discipline, one in w hom faith is lacking, [354] w ho is sham eless and brash, heaps up a m ass of evil kamma.

 Having engaged in m isconduct by body, speech, and mind, he forms the w ish: i . . • . . . . "M ay no one find out about m e."

 He twists around w ith his body,
 [twists around] by speech or mind; he piles up his evil deeds, in one w ay or another, repeatedly.

 This foolish evildoer, knowing his ow n m isdeeds, is a poor person who falls into debt, troubled while enjoying himself.

 His thoughts then prosecute him; painful m ental states born of remorse
 [follow him w herever he goes] w hether in the village or the forest.

 This foolish evildoer, knowing his ow n m isdeeds, goes to a certain [anim al] realm or is even bound in hell.

 This indeed is the suffering of bondage1341 from which the w ise person is freed, giving [gifts] w ith w ealth righteously gained, settling his m ind in confidence.

###### The householder endow ed w ith faith has m ade a lucky throw in both cases: for his welfare in this present life and happiness in future lives. Thus it is that for hom e-dw ellers this m erit increases through generosity.1342

 Just so, in the N oble O ne's discipline, one w hose faith is firm, who is endow ed w ith sham e, dreading wrong, wise and restrained b y virtuous behavior, . is said to live happily in the N oble O ne's discipline.

 H aving gained spiritual happiness, one then resolves on equanim ity. Having abandoned the five hindrances, . always arousing energy, he enters upon the jhanas, unified, alert, and m indful.

 H aving know n things thus as they really are, through com plete non-clinging the mind is rightly liberated with the destruction of all fetters.

 W ith the destruction of the fetters of existence, for the stable one, rightly liberated, the know ledge occurs: "M y liberation is unshakable."

 This is the suprem e know ledge; this is unsurpassed happiness. Sorrowless, dust-free, and secure, this is the highest freedom from debt. [355]

So too, Brahmin Dhammika, w ere you following the duty of an ascetic when the lay followers of the native district banished you from all seven m onasteries?" "But how , Bhante, does an ascetic follow the d u ty of an ascetic?" "H ere, Brahm in D ham m ika; an ascetic does not insult one who insults him , does not scold one who scolds him, and does not argue w ith one w ho argues with him. That is how an ascetic follows the duty of an ascetic." "Bhante, I w asn't following the duty of an ascetic w hen the lay followers banished m e from all seven m onasteries." (1) "In the past, Brahm in Dhammika, there was a teacher named Sunetta, the founder of a spiritual sect, one w ithout lust for sensual pleasures. The teacher Sunetta had m any hundreds of disciples. H e taught a D ham m a to his disciples for com pan­ ionship with the brahm a w orld.1362 W hen he was teaching such a Dhamma, those w ho did not place confidence in him w ere, with the breakup of the body, after death, reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; but those who placed confidence in him w ere reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly w orld.

I say, Brahmin D ham m ika, there is no injury1364 against outsid­ ers1365 like that against [your] fellow monks. Therefore, Brahm in Dhammika, you should train yourself thus: 'W e will not let hatred arise in ou r m inds tow ard our fellow m onks/1366 Thus, Brahmin Dham m ika, should you train yourself." [373]

 Sunetta, M ugapakkha, . the brahm in A ranem i, Kuddalaka, and H atthipala, the brahm in youth, w ere teachers.

 And Jotipala [know n as] Govinda the chaplain of seven [kings]: these were harm less ones in the past, six teachers possessed of fame.

 Unspoiled, liberated by compassion, these men had transcended the fetter of sensuality. Having expunged sensual lust, they w ere reborn in the brahm a world.

 . Their disciples too numbering m any hundreds were unspoiled, liberated in compassion, men w ho had transcended the fetter of sensuality. Having expunged sensual lust, they were reborn in the brahm a world.

 That m an w ho, w ith thoughts of hatred, reviles these outside seers devoid of lust

 But the m an w ho, w ith thoughts of hatred, reviles a disciple of the Buddha,

###### a bhikkhu accomplished in view, generates even more dem erit.

 One should not attack a holy person one who has abandoned viewpoints. This one is called the seventh person of the Sahgha of noble ones, one not devoid of lust for sensual pleasures, whose five faculties are weak: faith, mindfulness, energy, serenity, and insight.

 If one attacks such a bhikkhu, one first harms oneself; then, having harmed oneself, one afterward harms the other.

 W hen one protects oneself, the other person is also protected. Therefore one should protect oneself; the wise person is always unhurt. [374]

 55 (1) Sona Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. N ow on that occasion the Venerable Sona was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Cool Grove.1367 Then, while the Venerable Sona w as alone in seclusion, the following course of thought arose in his mind: "I am one of the Blessed One's most energetic disciples, yet m y mind has not been liberated from the taints by non-clinging. N ow there is wealth in my family, and it is possible for me to enjoy my wealth and do meritorious deeds. Let m e then give up the training and return to the lower life, so that I can enjoy m y wealth and do meritorious deeds." Then, having known with his ow n m ind the course of thought

###### in the Venerable Sona's mind, just as a strong m an might extend his draw n-in arm or draw in his extended arm , the Blessed One disappeared on Mount Vulture Peak and appeared in the Cool Grove in the presence of the Venerable Sona. The Blessed One sat dow n on the seat prepared for him . The Venerable Sona paid hom age to the Blessed One and sat dow n to one side. The Blessed One then said to him: [375] "Sona, w hen you w ere alone in seclusion, didn't the fol­ lowing course of thought arise in your m ind: 'I am one of the Blessed O ne's most energetic disciples, yet m y m ind has not been liberated from the taints by n on rd in gin g..N ow there is wealth in m y family, and it is possible for m e to enjoy m y wealth and do meritorious deeds.

"Tell me, Sona, in the past, w hen you livecl at hom e, weren't you skilled at the lute?" "Yes, Bhante." "W hat do you think, Sona? W hen its strings w ere too tight, w as your lute well tuned and easy to p lay ?" "N o, Bhante/' "W hen its strings w ere too loose, w as your lute well tuned and easy to play?" "N o, Bhante." ' "But, Sona, when its strings w ere neither too tight nor too loose but adjusted to a balanced pitch, w as your lute well tuned and easy to play?" "Yes, Bhante." "So too, Sona, if energy is aroused too forcefully this leads to restlessness, and if energy is too lax this leads to laziness. There­ fore, Sona, resolve on a balance of energy, achieve evenness of the spiritual faculties, and take up the object there."1368 "Yes, Bhante," the Venerable Sona replied. W hen the Blessed One had finished giving the Venerable Sona this exhortation, just as a strong m an m ight extend his draw n-in arm or draw in his extended arm , he disappeared in the Cool Grove and reappeared on M ount Vulture Peak. [376] Then, some time later, the V enerable Sona resolved on a bal­ ance of energy achieved evenness of the spiritual faculties

###### and took up the object there. Then, dwelling alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute, in no long time the Venerable Sona realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consum m ation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having entered upon it, he dwelled in it. He directly knew: "D estroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being." And the Venerable Sona became one of the arahants. Having attained arahantship, the. Venerable Sona thought: "Let me go to the Blessed One and declare final knowledge m his presence/' Then he approached the Blessed One, paid hom­ age to him, sat doWn to one side, and said: "Bhante, when a bhikkhu is an arahant, one whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the spiritual life, done what.had to be done, laid down the burden, reached his own goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, and become completely lib­ erated through final knowledge, he is intent upon six things: on renunciation, on solitude, on non-affliction, on the destruc­ tion of craving, on the destruction of clinging, and on non­ confusion/369 (1) "It m ay be, Bhante, that some venerable one here thinks: 'Could it be that this venerable one is intent upon renuncia­ tion on account of mere faith?' But it should not be seen in such a way. A bhikkhu with taints destroyed, who has lived the spiritual life and done his task, does not see in himself any­ thing further to be done or any [need to] increase what has been done.1370 He is intent upon renunciation because he is devoid of lust through the destruction of lust; because he is devoid of hatred through the destruction of hatred; because he is devoid of delusion through the destruction of delusion. [377] (2) "It may be that some venerable one here thinks: 'Could it be that this venerable one is intent upon solitude because he is hankering after gain, honor, and praise?' But it should not be seen in such a way. A bhikkhu w ith taints destroyed, who has lived the spiritual life and done his task, does not see in himself anything further to be done or any [need to] increase what has been done.

A bhikkhu with taints d estroyed , w ho has lived the spiri- . tual life and done his task, does not see in himself anything further to be done or any [need to] increase w hat has been done. He is intent upon non-affliction because he is devoid of lust through the destruction of lust; because he is devoid of hatred through the destruction of hatred; b ecau se he is devoid of delu­ sion through the destruction of delusion.

"Bhante, when a bhikkhu is thus perfectly liberated in mind, even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye com e into range of the eye, they do not obsess his m ind; his mind is not at all affected.

E ven if pow erful phenomena cognizable by the mind com e into range of the mind, they do not obsess his mind; his mind is not at all affected.

 If one is intent on renunciation and solitude of mind; if one is intent on non-affliction and the destruction of clinging; if one is intent on craving's destructior and non-confusion of mind: when one sees the sense bases' arising, one's m ind is completely liberated.

Let m e go to the park of the wanderers of other sects." Then the Venerable A nanda went to the park of the w anderers of other sects:... [as in 7:42, substituting Ananda for Sariputta and Kosambi for Savatthi] [ 3 8 ] ... "Is it possible, Bhante, in this Dhamma and discipline to describe a bhikkhu as 'ten-less' by the mere counting of years?" "In this D ham m a and discipline, Ananda, it isn't possible to describe a bhikkhu as 'ten-less' by the mere counting of years. There are, Ananda, these seven bases for [being] 'ten-less' that I have proclaim ed after realizing them, for myself w ith direct knowledge. W hat seven? H ere, a bhikkhu has (1) faith, (2) a sense of m oral sham e, (3). m oral dread; (4) he is learned, (5) energetic, (6) m indful, and (7) wise. These are the seven bases for [being] 'ten-less' that I have proclaim ed after realizing them for myself with direct know ledge. [39] "Ananda, if a bhikkhu possesses these seven bases for [being] 'ten-less/ then, if he lives the com plete and pure spiritual life for twelve years, he is fit to be called 'ten-less.' If, too, he lives the complete and pure spiritual life for twenty-four years, he is fit to be called 'ten-less.' If, too, he lives the complete and pure Spiritual life for thirty-six years, he is fit to be called 'ten-less.' If, too, he lives the com plete and pure spiritual life for forty-eight years, he is fit to be called 'ten-less.'"

One deity then said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, these bhikkhunls are liberated/' The other said: "Bhante, these bhikkhunls are well liberated without residue rem ain in g."1540. This is what those deities said. The Teacher agreed. Then,
 [thinking]: "The Teacher has ag reed ," they paid hom age to the Blessed One, circum am bulated him keeping the right side toward him, and disappeared right there. Then, when the night had passed, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "L ast n igh t, bhikkhus, w hen the night had advanced, two deities of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Vulture Peak, approached m e, paid hom age to me, and stood to one side.

This is what those deities said, after w hich they paid homage to m e, circumambulated m e keeping the right side toward me, and disappeared right there."

 M addened by anger he acquires a bad reputation. His relatives, friends, and loved ones avoid the angry person.

 A nger is a cause of harm; anger stirs up mental turmoil. People do not recognize the peril that has arisen from within.

 The angry person doesn't know the good; the angry person doesn't see the Dham ma. There is just blindness and dense gloom w hen anger overcom es a person. [97]

 W hen an angry person causes dam age, w hether easily or with difficulty, later, w hen the anger has vanished, he is torm ented as if burnt by fire.

 He show s recalcitrance as a fire does a sm oky crest. W hen his anger spreads outward, people becom e angry on his account.1563

 He has no sham e or fear of wrong, his speech is not respectful; one overcom e by anger has no island [of safety] at all.

 I will tell you about the deeds that produce torm ent. Listen to them as they are,1564 rem ote from those that are righteous:

 A n an gry person slays his father; an an gry person slays his own m other; an an gry person slays a brahmin;1565 an an gry person slays a worldling.

 The an gry w orldling slays his m other, the good w om an w ho gave him life, the one b y w hom he w as nurtured and w h o show ed him this world.

 Those beings, like oneself, . each hold their self m ost dear; yet those w ho are angry kill them selves in various w ay s1566 w hen they are distraught about diverse m atters.

 Som e kill them selves w ith a sw ord; som e w h o are distraught swallow poison; som e hang them selves with a rope; som e [jum p] into a m ountain gorge. [98]

 D eeds that involve destroying grow th1567 and deeds that cause their own death: w hen doing such deeds they do not know that defeat is born of anger.

 Thus death 's snare hidden in the heart has taken the form of anger. O ne should cut it off by self-control, w isd om , energy, and [right] view.

 The w ise person should eradicate this one unw holesom e [quality].1568 In such a w ay one should train in the D ham m a: do n ot yield to recalcitrance.

There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!" "Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this: "Bhikkhus, w hen the liberation of the mind by loving- kindness has been p u rsu ed , developed, and cultivated, m ade a vehicle and basis, carried out, consolidated, and properly undertaken, eight benefits are to be expected. W hat eight?

 He speaks to people just like an ascetic,

 Though he is devious, a speaker of lies, you should know him as he truly is; then you should all m eet in harm ony and firmly drive him away.

 For many inopportune times are spoken of, occasions obstructive to the path; for it is only som etim es, on occasion, that Tathagatas arise in the world.

 If one has directly encountered them,
 [fortune] rarely gained in the world, if one has obtained the hum an state, and the good D ham m a is being taught, for a person desiring his own good, this is incentive enough to strive. [228]

 How can one understand the good Dhamma, so that the m om ent w on 't slip by? For those who miss the m om ent grieve when they are reborn in hell.

 One here who has failed to obtain the fixed course of the good Dhamma,1690 will come to regret it for a long time like a merchant w ho has missed a profit.

 A person hindered by ignorance who has failed in the good Dhamma will long experience w andering on in [the round of] birth and death.

 But those who gain the hum an state when the good D ham m a is well proclaimed, have accomplished the Teacher's word, or will do so, or are doing so now.

 Those who have practiced the path, proclaimed by the Tathagata, have penetrated the right moment in the world the unsurpassed spiritual life.

There the Blessed One dw elled in the Icchanangala woodland thicket. The brahmin householders of Icchanangala heard: "It is said that the ascetic G otam a, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan family, has arrived at Icchanangala and is now dwelling [341] in the Icchanangala w oodland thicket. Now a good report about that M aster G otam a has circulated thus: T h at Blessed One is an arahant; perfectly enlightened... [as in 6 :4 2 ]... he reveals a spiritual life that is perfectly complete and p u re/ N ow it is good to see such arahants." Then, when the night had p assed, the brahm in householders of Icchanangala took abundant food of various kinds and went to the Icchanangala w oodland thicket. They stood outside the entrance making an u p roar and a racket. N ow on that, occa­ sion the Venerable N agita w as the Blessed O ne's attendant. The Blessed One then addressed the Venerable Nagita: "W ho is making such an uproar and a racket, N agita? One would think it w as fishermen at a haul of fish." "Bhante, these are the brahm in householders of Icchanangala w ho have brought abundant food of various kinds.

Then, in the evening, the Blessed One em erged from seclusion and w ent to the.assembly hall. H e stood outside the door w aiting for the talk to end. W hen he knew that the talk w as finished, he cleared his throat [359] and tapped on the bolt. The bhikkhus opened the door for him . The Blessed One then entered the assembly hall, sat dow n on the seat that was prepared for him, and said to the Venerable N andaka: "Y ou gave the bhikkhus a long exposition of the D ham m a. M y back w as aching while I stood outside the door w aiting for the talk to en d ." W hen this w as said, the Venerable N andaka, feeling em bar­ rassed, said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, I did not know that the Blessed One w as standing outsjde the door.

He should fulfill that factor, [thinking]: 'How can I be endowed with faith and virtuous, gain internal serenity of mind, and also gain the higher w isdom of insight into phenomena?'

Then not long after the Blessed One had left, the Venerable Nandaka addressed the bhikkhus: "Just now, friends, before he rose frorr his seat and entered his dwelling, the Blessed One revealed the perfectly com plete and pure spiritual life in four terms: [361 'Nandaka, a bhikkhu m ay be endowed with faith but not vir­ tuous [Nandaka here repeats the Buddha's discourse dow r to:]...

The pow er of w isdom , the pow er of energy, the power of blam elessness, and the pow er of sustaining a favorable relationship. (1) "A nd yvhat, bhikkhus, is the power of w isdom ? O ne has clearly seen an d explored w ith wisdom those qualities that are unw holesom e and reckoned as unwholesome; those that are wholesom e and reckoned as wholesome; those that are blam - able and reckoned as blam able; those that are blam eless and reckoned as blam eless; those that are dark and reckoned as dark; those that are bright and reckoned as bright; those that should not be cultivated and are reckoned as not to be culti­ vated; those that should be cultivated and are reckoned as to be cultivated; those that are unw orthy of the noble ones and reckoned as u n w orthy of the noble ones; those that are w orthy of the noble ones and reckoned as worthy of the noble ones.

**a n d** **strives for this. This is called the power of energy.**
###### (3) "And w hat is the power of blamelessness? Here, a noble disciple engages in blameless bodily, verbal, and mental action. This is called the pow er of blamelessness. (4) "A nd w hat is the pow er of sustaining a favorable rela­ tionship? There are these four means of sustaining a favorable relationship: giving, endearing speech, beneficent conduct, and impartiality. Am ong gifts, the best is the gift of the Dhamma. Among types of endearing speech, the best is repeatedly teach­ ing the D ham m a to one who is interested in it and listens with eager ears. A m ong types of beneficent conduct, the best is when one encourages, settles, and establishes a person w ith­ out faith in the accom plishm ent of faith, an immoral person in the accom plishm ent of virtuous behavior, a miserly person in the accomplishment of generosity, and an unwise person in the accomplishment of w isdom . Among types of impartiality, the best is that a stream -enterer is equal to a stream-enterer, a once- returner is equal to a once-returner, a non-returner is equal to a non-returner , and an arahant is equal to an arahant.1843 This is called the pow er of sustaining a favorable relationship. "These, bhikkhus, are the four powers. When a noble dis­ ciple possesses these four powers, he has transcended five fears. What five? (5) Fear of [loss of] livelihood, (6) fear of disrepute, (7) fear of tim idity in assemblies, [365] (8) fear of death, and (9) fear of a bad destination. The noble disciple reflects thus: T am not afraid on account of my livelihood. Why should I be afraid on account of m y livelihood? I have the four pow ers: the power of w isdom , the pow er of energy, the power of blameless­ ness, and the pow er of sustaining a favorable relationship. An unwise person m ight be afraid on account of his livelihood; a lazy person m ight be afraid on account of his livelihood; a person who engages in blamable bodily, verbal, and m ental action m ight be afraid on account of his livelihood; a person who does not sustain favorable relationships might be afraid on account of his livelihood.

 34 (3) Nibbana Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Venerable Sariputta was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. There the Venerable Sariputta addressed the bhik­ khus: "Friends, bhikkhus!" "Friend!" those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sariputta said this: "Happiness, friends, is this nibbana. Happiness, friends, is this nibbana." When this was said, the Venerable Udayi1908 said to the Ven­ erable Sariputta: [415] "But, friend Sariputta, what happiness could there be here when nothing is felt here?" "Just this, friend, is the happiness here, that nothing is felt here. "There are, friends, these five objects of sensual pleasure. What five? Form s cognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensual pleasure, tantalizing; sounds cognizable by the e a r... odors cognizable by the nose... tastes cognizable by the tongue... tactile objects cognizable by the body that are w ished for, desired, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensual pleasure, tantalizing. These

"The purpose and benefit of the knowledge and vision of things as they really are is disenchantment and dispassion." (10) "And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of disen­ chantment and dispassion?" "The purpose and benefit of disenchantment and dispassion is the knowledge and vision of liberation. "Thus, Ananda, (1)—(2) the purpose and benefit of wholesome virtuous behavior is non-regret; (3) the purpose and benefit of non-regret is joy; (4) the purpose and benefit of joy is rapture; (5) ‘the purpose and benefit o f rapture is tranquility; (6) the purpose and benefit of tranquility is pleasure; (7) the purpose and benefit of pleasure is concentration; (8) the purpose and benefit of concentration is the knowledge and vision of things as they really are; (9) the purpose and benefit of the knowledge and vision of things as they really are is disenchantment and dispassion; and (10) the purpose and benefit of disenchantment and dispassion is the know ledge and vision of liberation.. Thus, Ananda, wholesome virtuous behavior progressively leads to the foremost."1964

 the disparity, the difference between the ascetic Gotama's [49] teaching of the Dhamma and our teaching, between his instruc­ tion and our instruction?" Then those bhikkhus neither applauded nor rejected the statem ent of those wanderers. Without applauding it, with­ out rejecting it, they rose from their seats and left, [thinking]: "W e shall find out what the Blessed One has to say about this statem ent." Then, when those bhikkhus had walked for alms in Savatthi, after their meal, on returning from their alm s round, they approached the Blessed One, paid homage to hi m, sat down to one side, and said: "Here, Bhante, in the morning, we dressed, took our bowls and robes, and entered Savatthi for alms....
 [They here report the entire course of events^ dow n to:] [50] We rose from our seats and left, [thinking]: 'W e shall find out what the Blessed One has to say about this statem ent/" . "Bhikkhus, when wanderers of other sects speak thus, they should be answered in this way: 'A question about one, a con­ cise statement about one, an explanation of one.2003 A question about two, a concise statement about two, an explanation of two. A question about three, a concise statement about three, an explanation of three. A question about four, a concise state­ ment about four, an explanation of four.

"But, Bhante, w hat is divine merit?" "One rejoices in heaven for an eon, Ananda." [77]

 Pleasant is concord in the Sangha, and the mutual help 2042 of those who live in concord. Delighting in concord, established in Dhamma, one does not fall aw ay from security from bondage. Having brought concord to the Sangha, one rejoices in heaven for an eon.

N ow on that occasion, after their meal, on returning from their alms round, a num ber of bhikkhus had assembled in the assembly hall and w ere sitting together engaging in various kinds of pointless talk, that is: talk about kings, thieves, and ministers of state; talk about arm ies, perils, and w ars; talk about food, drink, garments, and beds; talk about garlands and scents; talk about relatives, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about w om en and talk about heroes; street talk and talk by the well; talk about the departed; miscellaneous talk; speculation about the. world and the sea; talk about becoming this or that. Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclu­ sion and w ent to the assembly hall, where he sat down on the prepared seat. The Blessed One then addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, w hat discussion were you engaged in just now as you were sitting together here? W hat was the conversation that was underw ay?"

Now on that occasion a num ber of very well-known Lic­ chavis had entered the Great W ood in order to see the Blessed One, and as they followed one another in their finest carriages they made art uproar and a. racket.

(3) An unsuitable show is a thorn to one guarding the doors of the sense faculties. (4) Keeping company with women is a thorn to the celibate life. [135] (5) Noise is a thorn to the first jhana.

What ten? (1) He does not achieve what he has not yet achieved. (2) He falls aw ay from what he has achieved.

(9) He dies confused. (10) W ith the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of m isery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. W hen a bhikkhu is one who insults and disparages his fellow m onks, a reviler of the noble ones, it is impossible and inconceivable that he will not incur at least one of these ten disasters."

 [The Blessed One replied:] "D o not say so, Kokalika! Do not say so, Kokalika!2110 Place confidence in Sariputta and Moggallana, Kokalika. Sariputta and M oggallana are well behaved." A second time the bhikkhu Kokalika said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, although I consider the Blessed One worthy of faith and trust, [I still say that] Sariputta and Moggallana have evil desires and have come under the control of evil desires." "D o not say so, K okalika!. . . Sariputta and Moggallana are well b eh av ed /''

 A third time the bhikkhu Kokalika said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, although I consider the Blessed One w orthy of faith and trust, [I still say that] Sariputta and M oggallana have evil desires and have come under the control of evil desires/' "D o not say so, Kokalika! Do not say so, Kokalika! Place con­ fidence in Sariputta and M oggallana, Kokalika. Sariputta and Moggallana are well behaved." Then the bhikkhu Kokalika rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circum am bulated the. Blessed One keeping the right side tow ard him , and dep arted . N ot long after the bhikkhu Kokalika had left, his entire body becam e covered with boils the size of mustard seeds. These then grew to the size of mung beans; then to. the size of chickpeas; then to the size of jujube pits; then to the size of jujube fruits; then to the.size of myrobalans; then to the size of unripe belli fruits;2111 then to the size of ripe belli fruits. W hen they h ad grow n to the size of ripe belli fruits, they burst, open, [171] exuding pus and .blood. He then just lay on banana leaves like a fish that had swallowved poison. Then the independent brahm a Tudu approached the bhik­ khu Kokalika,2112 stood in the air, and said to him: "Place con­ fidence in Sariputta and M oggallana, Kokalika. Sariputta and M oggallana are well behaved." "W ho are you, friend?" "I am the independent brahm a T u d u ." "D idn't the Blessed One declare you to be a non-returner, friend? Then why have you com e back here? See how much w rpng you have done."2113 Then the independent brahm a Tudu addressed the bhikkhu Kokalika in verse:

 "W hen a person has taken birth an axe is born inside his m outh with which the fool cuts him self by uttering wrongful speech.

 "H e who praises one deserving blam e2114 or blames one deserving praise casts with his m outh an unlucky throw

 "Slight is the unlucky throw at dice that results in the loss of one's wealth,
 [the loss] of all, oneself included; much worse is this unlucky throw of harboring hate against the holy ones.

 "For a hundred thousand and thirty-six nirabbudas, plus five abbudas,2115 the slanderer of noble ones goes to hell, having defamed them with evil speech and m ind/' [172]

 . Then the bhikkhu Kokalika died on account of that illness, and because of his resentment against Sariputta and Moggallana, after death he was reborn in the red-lotus hell.2116 . Then, when the night had advanced, Brahm a Sahampati, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire. Jeta's .Grove, approached the Blessed One, paid hom age to him, stood to one side, and said to him: "Bhante, the bhikkhu Kokalika has died, and because of his resentment against Sariputta and M oggallana, after death he has been reborn in the red-lotus hell." This is what Brahma Sahampati said. He then paid hom­ age to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and disappeared right there. Then, when the night had passed, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, last night, when the night had advanced, Brahma Sahampati approached me and said to me ... [as above]... He then paid homage to m e, circumambulated me keeping the right side toward me, and disappeared right there." W hen this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "H ow long, Bhante, is the life span in the red-lotus hell?"2117 "The life span in the red-lotus hell is long, bhikkhu. It is not easy to count it and say it is so many [173] years, or so many hundreds of years, or so many thousands of years, or so many hundreds of thousands of years." "Then is it possible, Bhante, to give a simile?" /Tt is, bhikkhu," the Blessed One said. "Suppose there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty measures of sesamum seed.

Now on that occasion the wanderers of other sects had assembled and were making an uproar as they loudly and boisterously sat discussing various pointless topics.

"H aving thus gone forth and possessing the bhikkhus' train­ ing and w ay of life, having abandoned the destruction of life, he abstains from the destruction of life; with the rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious and kindly, he dwells compassionate tow ard all living beings.

Having abandoned sexual activity, he observes celibacy, [205] living apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the common person's practice. "H aving abandoned false speech, he abstains from false speech; he speaks truth, adheres to truth; he is trustw orthy and reliable, no deceiver of the world. Having abandoned divisive speech, he abstains from divisive speech; he does not repeat elsew here w hat he has heard here in order to divide [those people] from these, nor does he repeat to these w hat he has heard elsewhere in order to divide [these people] from those; thus he is one who reunites those who are divided, a prom oter of unity, who enjoys concord, rejoices in concord, delights in concord, a speaker of words that prom ote concord. Having abandoned harsh speech, he abstains from harsh speech; he speaks w ords that are gentle, pleasing to the ear, lovable, words that go to the heart, courteous words that are desired by many people and agreeable to many people.

W hen they had concluded their' greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One: "M aster Gotama, w hat is the near shore? What is the far shore?" . . . "Brahmin, (1) the destruction of life is the near shore, absten­ tion from the destruction of life the far. shore. (2) Taking what is not given is the near shore, abstention from taking w hat is not given the far shore. (3) Sexual misconduct is the near shore, abstention from sexual misconduct the far shore. (4) False speech is the near shore, abstention from false speech the far shore. (5) Divisive speech is the near shore, abstention from divisive speech the far shore. (6) H arsh speech is the near shore, abstention from harsh speech the far shore. (7) Idle chatter is the near shore, abstention from idle chatter the far shore. (8) Longing is the near shore, non-longing the far shore. (9) 111 will is the near shore, good will the far shore. (10) Wrong view is the near shore, right view the far shore. The one, brahmin, is the near shore, the other the far shore." [253]

 Few are those people who go beyond. The rest merely run along the [near] shore.

 When the Dhamma is rightly expounded those people who practice accordingly are the ones who will go beyond the realm of Death so hard to cross.

###### V 254 Sutta 171 1511

 Having left the dark qualities behind, a wise person should develop the bright ones. Having come from hom e into hom elessness, where it is hard to take delight—

 There in seclusion one should seek delight, having left behind sensual pleasures. Owning nothing, the w ise person should cleanse him self of m ental defilements,

 Those whose m inds are rightly well developed in the enlightenment factors, who through non- clinging find delight in the relinquishment of grasping: luminous, with taints destroyed, they are the quenched ones in the world.

 170 (4) The Near Shore "Bhikkhus, I will teach you the near shore and the far shore. Listen and attend closely. I will speak." " Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied.

 174 (8) Causes of Kamma "Bhikkhus, the destruction of life, I say, is threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Taking w h at is not given, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Sexual m isconduct I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusionl False speech, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed> caused by h atred, and caused by delusion. Divisive speech, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. H arsh speech, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Idle ch at­ ter, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, .caused, by hatred, and caused by delusion. Longing, [262] I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Ill will, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. W rong view, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. "Thus, bhikkhus, greed is a source and origin of kam m a; hatred is a sou rce and origin of kamma; delusion is a source and origin of kam m a. W ith the destruction of greed, a source of kamma is extinguished. W ith the destruction of hatred, a source of kam m a is extinguished. W ith the destruction of delusion, a source of kam m a is extinguished."

 175 (9) Avoidance "Bhikkhus, this D ham m a offers a means of avoidance. It does not lack a m eans of avoidance. And how does this D ham m a offer a m eans of avoidance and not lack a means of avoidance? (1) "O ne w ho destroys life has abstention from the d estru c­ tion of life as the m eans to avoid it. (2) One w ho takes w h at is not given has abstention from taking what is n ot given as the m eans to avoid it. (3) One who engages in sexual m isconduct has abstention from sexual misconduct as the m eans to avoid it. (4) One w ho speaks falsely has abstention from false speech as the m ean s to avoid it. (5) One who speaks divisively has

 abstention from divisive speech as the means to avoid it. (6) One who speaks harshly has abstention from harsh speech as the m eans to avoid it. (7) One who indulges in idle chatter has abstention from idle chatter as the means to avoid it. (8) One full of longing has non-longing as the means to avoid it. (9) One full of ill will has good will as the means to avoid it. (10) One who holds w rong view has right view as the means to avoid it. "It is in this w ay, bhikkhus, that this Dhamma offers a means of avoidance and does not lack a means of avoidance." [263]

 176 (10) Cunda Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One w as dwell­ ing at Fava in the mango grove of Cunda, the sm ith's sOn.2165 Then Cunda, the smith's son, approached the Blessed One, paid hom age to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him: "Cunda, w hose rites of purity2166 do you prefer?" "Bhante, I prefer the rites of purity prescribed by the. brah­ mins of the w est w ho carry around waterpots, w ear garlands of water plants, tend the sacred fire, and immerse themselves in w ater." "A nd how , Cunda, do the brahmins of the w est prescribe . their rites of purity?" "H ere, Bhante, the brahmins of the west enjoin a disciple thus: 'Come, good m an, having gotten up early, you should stroke the ground from your bed. If you don't stroke the ground, you should stroke w et cow dung. If you don't stroke w et cow dung, you should stroke green grass. If you don't stroke green grass, you should tend the sacred fire. If you don't tend the sacred fire, you should pay homage to the sun with reverential salutation. If you don't pay hom age to the sun with reverential salutation, you should im m erse yourself in water three times including the evening.' It is in this way that the brahmins of the west prescribe their rites of purity. It is their rites of purity that I prefer." "C unda, purification in the Noble One's discipline is quite different from the rites of purity prescribed by the brahm ins of the w est who carry around waterpots, w ear garlands of w ater plants, tend the sacred fire, and immerse them selves in w ater." [264] "But how, Bhante,' does purification come about in the Noble

"W ell then, C unda, listen and attend closely. I will speak." "Yes, Bhante," C unda, the smith's son, replied. The Blessed One said this: "Im purity by body, Cunda, is threefold. Im purity by speech is fourfold- Im purity by mind is threefold. "A nd how , C unda, is impurity by body threefold? (1) "H ere, som eone destroys life. He is m urderous, bloody- handed, given to blow s and violence, m erciless to living beings. (2) "H e takes w hat is not given. He steals the/w ealth and property of others in the village or forest. . (3) "H e engages in sexual misconduct. He has sexual relations with w om en w ho are protected by their m other, father, m other and father, b roth er, sister, or relatives; w ho are p rotected by their D ham m a; w ho have a husband; whose violation entails a penalty; or even w ith one already engaged.2167 "It is in this w ay that im purity by body is threefold. "A nd how , C unda, is im purity by speech fourfold? (4) "H ere, som eone speaks falsehood. If he is sum m oned to a council, to an assem bly, to his relatives' presence, to his guild, or to the court, and questioned as a witness thus: 'So, good m an, tell w hat you know ,' then, not knowing, he says, T k n o w / or knowing, he says, T do not know'; not seeing, he says, 'I s e e / or seeing, he says, 'I do not see.' Thus [265] he consciously speaks falsehood for his ow n ends, or for another's ends, or for som e trifling w orldly end. (5) "H e speaks divisively. H aving heard som ething here, he repeats it elsew here in order to divide [those people] from these; or h aving heard something elsew here, he repeats it to these people in order to divide [them] from those. Thus he is one w ho divides those w ho are united, a creator of divisions, one w ho enjoys factions, rejoices in factions, delights in factions, a speaker of w ord s that create factions.

He longs for the wealth and property of others thus: 'Oh, m ay what belongs to another be mine!' , (9) "H e has a mind of ill will and intentions of hate thus: 'May these beings be slain, slaughtered,2168 cut off, destroyed, or annihilated!' (10) ''He holds w rong view and has an incorrect perspec­ tive thus: 'There is nothing given, nothing sacrificed, nothing offered; there is no fruit or result of good and bad actions; there is no this world, no other world; there is no mother, no father; there are no beings spontaneously reborn; there are in the world no ascetics and brahmins of right conduct and right practice who, having realized this world and the other world for them­ selves by direct knowledge, make them known to others.' "It is in this w ay that im purity by mind is threefold. [266] "These, Cunda, are the ten courses of unwholesome kamma. If one engages in these ten courses of unwholesome kamma, then, if one gets up early and strokes the ground from one's bed, one is impure, and if one doesn't stroke the ground, one is impure. If one strokes w et cow dung, one is impure, and if one doesn't stroke wet cow dung, one is impure. If one strokes green grass, one is impure, and if one doesn't stroke green grass, one is impure. If one tends the sacred fire, one is impure, and if one doesn't tend the sacred fire, one is impure; If one pays homage to the sun with reverential salutation, one is impure, and if one doesn't pay homage to the sun with reverential salutation, one is impure. If one immerses oneself in water three times includ­ ing the evening, one is impure, and if one doesn't immerse one­ self in water three times including the evening, one is impure. For what reason? Because these ten courses of unwholesome kamma are themselves im pure and defiling. It is because people engage in these ten courses of unwholesome kamma that hell, the animal realm, the sphere of afflicted spirits, and other bad destinations are seen.

 Homage to the Blessed One, the Araltant, the Perfectly Enlightened One

 I. D e p e n d e n c e

 1 (1) What Purpose?7199 Thus have I heard. O n one occasion the Blessed O ne w as dw ell­ ing at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. Then the Venerable A nanda approached the Blessed O ne, paid hom age to him , sat dow n to one side, and said to him: (1) "B hante, w hat is the purpose and benefit of w holesom e virtuous behavior?" (2) "A n an d a, the purpose and benefit of w holesom e virtuous behavior is non-regret." (3) "A n d w hat, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of non­ reg ret?" ’ "The purpose and benefit of non-regret is joy." (4) "A n d w hat, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of joy?" "T he purpose and benefit of joy is rap ture." (5) "A n d w hat, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of rapture?" "The purpose and benefit of rapture is tranquility." (6) "A n d w h at, Bhante, is the p u rpose an d benefit of tranquility?" "T he purpose and benefit of tranquility is pleasure." (7) "A n d w hat, Bhante, is the p urp ose and benefit of p leasu re?" "T he purpose and benefit of pleasure is concentration." (8) "A n d w h at, Bhante, is the pu rpose an d benefit of concentration?" "T he purpose and benefit of concentration is the know ledge

###### (9) "A n d w hat, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of the know ledge and vision of things as they really are?" "The purpose and benefit of the know ledge and vision of things as they really are is disenchantment." (10) A n d w h at, Bhante, is the p u rp ose and benefit of disenchantm ent?" "The purpose and benefit of disenchantment is dispassion."
 [312] (11) "A n d w hat, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of dispassion?" "The purpose and benefit of dispassion is the know ledge and vision of liberation." "Thus, A nanda, (l)-(2 ) the purpose and benefit of w holesom e virtuous behavior is non-regret; (3) the purpose and benefit of non-regret is joy; (4) the purpose.and benefit of joy is rapture; (5) th e.p u rp o se and benefit of rapture is tranquility; (6) the purpose and benefit of tranquility is pleasure; (7) the purpose and benefit of pleasure is concentration; (8) the p urpose and benefit of concentration is the knowledge and vision of things as they really are; (9) the purpose and benefit of the know ledge and vision of things as they really are is disenchantm ent; (10) the purpose and benefit of disenchantment is dispassion; and (10) the purpose arid benefit of dispassion is the know ledge and vision of liberation. Thus, Ananda, w holesom e virtuous behavior progressively leads to the forem ost."

 2 (2) Volition2200 (1)—(2) "Bhikkhus, for a virtuous person> one .whose behavior is virtuous, no volition need be exerted: 'Let non-regret arise in m e / It is natural that non-regret arises in one w ho is virtuous, one w hose behavior is virtuous.

(7) "F o r one feeling pleasure no volition need be exerted: 'Let m y m ind be concentrated/ It is natural that the m ind of one feeling pleasure is concentrated. (8) "F o r one w ho is concentrated no volition need be exerted: 'Let m e know and see things as they really a re / It is natural
 [313] that one who is concentrated knows and sees things as they really are. (9) "F o r one w ho knows and sees things as they really are no volition need be exerted: 'Let me be disenchanted/ It is natu­ ral that one w ho knows and sees things as they really are is disenchanted. (10) "F o r one who is disenchanted no volition need be exerted: 'Let m e becom e dispassionate/ It is natural, that one w ho is disr enchanted becom es dispassionate. (1 1 )" For one who is dispassionate no volition need be exerted: 'Let m e realize the knowledge and vision of liberation.' It is natural that one who is dispassionate realizes the knowledge and vision of liberation. . "Thus, bhikkhus, (11)—(10) the knowledge and vision of lib­ eration is the purpose and benefit of dispassion; (9) dispassion is the purpose and benefit of disenchantment; (8) disenchantm ent is the purpose and benefit of the knowledge and vision of things as they really are; (7) the knowledge and vision of things as they really are is the purpose and benefit of concentration; (6) concen­ tration is the purpose and benefit of pleasure; (5) pleasure is the purpose and benefit of tranquility; (4) tranquility is the purpose and benefit of rapture; (3) rapture is the purpose and benefit of joy; (2) joy is the purpose and benefit of non-regret; and (1) non­ regret is the purpose and benefit of virtuous behavior. "T hus, bhikkhus, one stage flows into the next stage, one stage fills up the next stage, for going from the near shore to the far shore."

Then the Venerable Sandha2208 approached the Blessed One, paid hom age to him , and sat dow n to one side. The Blessed One then said to him : "M editate like a thoroughbred, Sandha, not like a wild colt.' And how does a wild colt m editate? W hen a wild colt is tied up near the feeding trough he m editates: 'Fodder, fodder!' For w hat reason? Because w hen a w ild colt is tied up by the feed­ ing trough, he does not ask himself: 'N ow what task will my trainer set for me today? W hat can 1 do to satisfy him ?' Tied up by the feeding trough, he just m editates: 'Fodder, fodder!' So too, Sandha, a person w ho is like a wild colt, when gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an em pty hut, dwells with a mind obsessed and oppressed by sensual lust, and he does not understand as it really is the escape from arisen sensual lust.

 1 Norman (2006a: 53) writes: "There is no agreement among schol­ ars about the date when writing first came into use in India, but everyone, I think, agrees that during the early period of Bud­ dhism, even if writing were available, all teaching was by oral methods, and the Buddhist scriptures were transmitted orally, as was also the case with the brahmanical texts." 2 For the Samyutta and Ariguttara Nikayas, Kelly uses the number of suttas that I had calculated in Connected Discourses of the Bud­ dha and in the present work, respectively. 3 Kelly surveyed only the older stratum of works in the Khud- daka Nikaya: Khuddakapatha, Dhammapada, Udana, Itivut- taka, Suttanipata, Theragatha, and Therxgatha. 4 I can see no reason, apart from faulty transmission, for the recol­ lection of generosity to be missing. 5 I have simplified the table to cover only the broad divisions. 6 In AN the threefold template occurs at 3:103-6. It also occurs in M N 13 in relation to sensual pleasures, bodily form, and feeling, and in SN in relation to the four physical elements, the five aggre­ gates, and the six sense bases respectively at 14:31-33,22:26-28, and 35:13-18. 7 In the Abhidhamma and later Pali texts, views (ditthi) were added to the asavas as well, thus increasing their number to four. 8 Several suttas subdivide the stream-enterer and the non-returner into subsidiary types, thereby increasing the number of noble ones. See 3:87 for the stream-enterer and 3:88, 7:16, and 7:55 for the non-returner. 9 Kelly (2011:13) counts nineteen suttas in AN spoken to women. In contrast, according to his reckoning, the other four Nikayas (including the older stratum of the Khuddaka Nikaya) have a total of only eight suttas spoken to women. 10 In Pali editions it is customary to attach the word adi to the first term of a series to indicate that the terms to follow conform to

 17 Here and elsewhere I render the Pali idiom cittam pariyadaya titthati simply as '"[it] obsesses the iriind." Literally, it would be rendered "having overcome the mind, [it] remains [there]." 18 Mp: "The bodily odor of a woman is foul (duggandha), but what is intended here is the odor that comes from her body due to ointments, etc." .19 Mp: "The taste of a woman is the taste of her lips/saliva, etc., and the taste of the porridge and rice, etc., she gives to her hus­ band. Many beings meet disaster after receiving sweets from a woman." 20 Mp: "Because of the different inclinations and underlying ten­ dencies of beings, the Buddha mentions each of the [five sense objects] such as forms, saying: T do not see anything like this/ When a man esteems form, the form of a woman obsesses and impedes him—binds, captivates, deludes, and confuses him; but not so the other sense objects such as sounds. So too, sound but not form captivates one who esteems sound, etc. For some people, only one sense object obsesses the mind; for others, two objects— or three, four, or five objects—obsess them. Thus these five suttas are expounded because of the five kinds of esteem
 [for different sense objects]." 21 Mp: "It is not only men who esteem the five sense objects but women too: Therefore the next five suttas are formulated with women as the subject." 22 This series of suttas posits connections between the five hin­ drances and their principal conditions. In this respect, the suttas are similar to the sections of SN 46:2, V 64-65, and SN 46:51, V 102-3, on the nourishment of the five hindrances. For more on the five hindrances in AN, see 5:23, 5:51, 5:52, 5:193.

###### 23 Subhanimitta. Mp: "The mark of the attractive is an object that is a basis for lust/' Mp cites various uses of the word nimitta: as a condition (paccaya), a cause (karana), concentration (samadhi), and insight (vipnssana). Here it means "an agreeable object that is a basis for lust" (ragatthaniyo ittharammanadhammo). Mp glosses ayoniso rnanasikaroio with anupayena manasikarontassa ("for one who attends unskillfully") and cites the definition of "careless attention" (ayoniso manasikara) at Vibh 373 (Be §936): "Careless attention is deviant attention, which takes the impermanent to be permanent, suffering to be happiness, what is non-self to be self, and the unattractive to be attractive. Or it is the mental turning, advertence, leaning, consideration, attention [to an object] in a way that runs contrary to the [four noble] truths." It seems to me doubtful that this explanation of ayoniso manasikara will hold for all applications of the term in the Nikayas. Even in the following sutta> on the arising and increase of ill will, it is questionable that attending carelessly to "the mark of the repulsive" can be subsumed under any of the four distortions in the definition at Vibh 373. 24 Patighdnimitta. Mp: "This denotes a disagreeable- mark; it is a designation for aversion (repulsion) and for a repulsive object" (anittham nimittam; patighassapi patighassarammanassapi e.tam adhivacanam). Interestingly, Mp continues with a citation from "the commentary": "For it is said in the commentary: 'The mark of the repulsive is aversion (repulsion) and a repulsive object'" (vuttampi c'etam atthakathayam patighampi patighanimittam, patigharammanopi dJmmmopatighanunittan tf). Mp-t identifies "the commentary" as "the Great Commentary" (maha atthakatha), one of the ancient Sinhala commentaries that Buddhaghosa used as the source for his own commentaries. These ancient commen­ taries are no longer extant, but this allusion makes it clear that Buddhaghosa worked with sources and did not write original compositions. 25 These terms are defined at Vibh 352 (Be §§856-860). 26 Avupasantacittassa. Mp: "A mind not settled by jhana or insight." 27 Mp cites Dhs 205 (Be §1167) for a definition of the hindrance of doubt (vicikicchanivarana) as doubt about the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha, and the training (see too 5:205). 28 This series, 1:16—20, corresponds to SN 46:51 §3, V 105-6, on the "denourishment" or removal of the five hindrances. 29 Mp uses the commentarial scheme of five kinds of abandon ing to explain how sensual desire and the other hindrances are abandoned: (1) in a particular respect (tadangappahana)f throu

 insight; (2) by suppression (vikkhambhanappahana), through a meditative attainment; (3) by eradication (samucchedappahana), through the world-transcending path; (4) by subsiding (pati- passaddhippahana), through the fruition; and (5) by escape (nissaranappahana), through nibbana, "the release from all defile­ ments." Mp says that all five apply here. Mp identifies the "mark of the unattractive" (asubhanimitta) with the first jhana arisen on the basis of any of the ten unattractive objects (dasasu asubhesu uppannam sarammanam path'amajjhanam). This explanation relies on the Vism scheme, which takes the asubha objects to be corpses in stages of decomposition (see Vism 178—93, Ppn 6.1—80). While we do find meditation on decaying corpses in the Nikayas (see below at 1:480—84)y more typically the suttas explain the perception of the unattractive (asubhasanna) as meditation on the thirty-one components of the body (increased to thirty-two in later works by adding the brain). See,, for exam­ ple, 10:60 §3, on the perception of unattractiveness. This per­ ception occurs among a group of five meditation subjects that culminate in the deathless (5:61), that lead to nibbana (5:69) and to the destruction of the taints (5:70), and that bring liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom (5:71). At 7:49 §1, the perception of unattractiveness is recommended as the antidote to sexual desire, and at 9:1 §6 and 9:3 §6 it is prescribed for the abandoning of lust. 30 In line with the commentary to the Satipatthana Sutta (at Sv III 778—82, Ps I 282—86), Mp enumerates six things that lead to the abandoning of each of the five hindrances. The six that lead to the abandoning of sensual desire are: learning an unattractive object, meditation on an unattractive object, guarding the doors of the sense faculties, moderation in eating, good friendship, and suitable conversation. 31 Mettacetovimutti: Mp: "Loving-kindness pervades all beings with
 [the wish for] their welfare. Since the mind associated with it is liberated from the opposed states such as the hindrances, it is called liberation of mind (cetovimutti). Specifically, this "libera­ tion of mind' is liberated from obsession by ill will. Here, what is intended by liberation of mind' is absorption (appana) by three or four jhanas [depending on whether the fourfold or fivefold scheme of jhanas is used]." Mp-t: "[This is said] because there is no thorough liberating [of the mind] by loving-kindness until one attains absorption." At 6:13 §1 loving-kindness is taught as the escape from ill will. At 9:1 §7 and 9:3 §7, it is recommended for abandoning ill will. 8:63 §1 teaches different approaches to

###### Notes to the Ones 1595

 8:1 and 11:15 explain, respectively, eight and eleven benefits of mastering the liberation of the mind by loving-kindness. The fourfold scheme of jhanas is typical of the Nikayas; the five­ fold scheme appears in the Abhidhamma by dividing the sec­ ond jhana into two: the second with examination but without thought, the third without thought and examination. 32 Mp mentions six things that lead to the abandoning of ill will: learning the meditation on loving-kindness, cultivating medi­ tation on loving-kindness, reviewing ownership of kamma/ abundant reflection, good friendship, and suitable conversa­ tion. Gn "reviewing ownership of kamma," Mp says that one should reflect thus: "If you get angry with another person, what can you do? Can you destroy his virtuous behavior, etc.? Didn't you come into this world on account of your own kamma and . won't you depart through your own kamma? Getting angry . with another person is like taking hold of a hot flameless coal or an.iron stake smeared with excrement in order to strike some­ one. If he gets angry with you, what can he do? Can he destroy your virtuous behavior, etc.? Didn't he come into this world on account of his own kamma and won't he depart through his own kamma? just like an offering of a cake that is refused, or like a fist full of dust thrown against the wind, his anger will remain with him." For more ways of overcoming anger, see Vism 298-306, Ppn 9:14-39. 33 Arambhadhatu, nikkamadhatu, parakkamadhatu. Mp explains these as three successively more powerful degrees of energy. 34 Mp mentions six other things that lead to the abandoning of dull­ ness and drowsiness: moderation in food, change of posture, the perception of light, living out in the open, good friendship, and suitable conversation. For moderation in food, Mp (in line with other commentaries) suggests that when one still has room for four or five more mouthfuls, one should stop eating and drink water. 35 Vupasantacittassa. Mp: "A mind pacified by jhana or by insight." 36 Mp: "Six other things lead to the abandoning of restlessness and remorse: much learning, asking questions, being skilled in the Vinaya, approaching elder monks, good friendship, and suitable conversation/'. 37 This is an abridgment. SN 46:51 §3, V 106,9-15, says that the "denourishment" of doubt occurs "by giving careful attention to wholesome and unwholesome qualities, blamable and blame­ less qualities, inferior and superior qualities, dark and bright qualities with their counterparts "

 38 Mp: ''Six other things lead to the abandoning of doubt: much learning, asking questions, skill in the Vinaya, abundant resolve (that is, trust and faith in the Three Jewels), good friendship, and suitable conversation." 39 Apatubhutam. As I understand it, this statement is saying that the mind's potential has not yet become manifest, has not been tapped and applied. 40 Yathabhatam nikkhitto. I translate this idiom on the basis of Mp's gloss\yatha aharitva. thapito. 41 Mp: "A mind corrupted by hate" (dosena padutthacittam). This sutta and the following might be seen as prose elaborations of. Dhp 1 and 2. Though Dhp 1 and 2 use mano rather than citta, the adjectives are the same: paduttha and pasanna. 42 Mp: "[A mind] placid with faith and confidence" (saddhapdsadena pasannam). ' ' 43 Mp: "Cloudy (avilena): enveloped by the five hindrances." At 5:193 §5 cloudy water is specifically identified with doubt and limpid water with freedom from doubt.. . . 44 ilttarim. manussadhammB. alamariyananadassCinaviseSam. I follow Mp, which treats uttarim manussadhamma- as a complex ablative phrase relative to alamariyananadassanavisesarn. Mp says: " Super­ human: superior to the human virtue consisting in the ten courses of wholesome kamma. For this tenfold virtue is called 'human virtue' because it is undertaken by people on their own—even without anyone to encourage them— after they have been stirred at the end of "the period of swords' (satthantarakappa;.see DN III 73,4). The things superior to this are the jhanas, insight,, the path, and the fruit. Distinction in knozoledge and vision worthy of the noble ones: the distinction [excellence] consisting in knowledge and vision that is fitting for the noble ones or able to produce the noble state. Knowledge itself is called 'knowledge' in that it knows, and it is called 'vision' in that it sees. This is a designation for the knowledge of the divine eye, insight knowledge, path knowledge, fruition knowledge, and reviewing knowledge." 45 Mp, using the Abhidhamma model of the mind, takes this to refer to the extreme speed with which the mind arises and van­ ishes. But at Vin I 150,7-14, in a passage on the conditions that entitle a bhikkhu to cut short his rains observance, it is said that if a woman is trying to seduce a bhikkhu at his rains residence, he is entitled to depart after reflecting: "The Blessed One said that the mind is quick to change, and here there is an obstacle to my living the celibate life." In this context, the obvious sense is not that the mind arises and ceases quickly but that one might

###### Notes to the Ones 1597

 suddenly change one's mind, giving up the celibate life to submit to the charms of the woman. Pabhassaram idam bhikkhave cittam. The exact meaning of this statement has been a matter of contention that has spawned con­ flicting interpretations. Mp identifies the "luminous mind" with the bhavangacitta, an Abhidhamma concept denoting the type of mental event that occurs in the absence of active cognition. It corresponds, very roughly, to the subconscious or unconscious of modem psychology. The word bhavahga means "factor of exis­ tence," that is, the factor responsible for maintaining continuous personal.identity throughout a given life and from one life to the next. However, the bhavanga is not a persistent state of con­ sciousness, a permanent self. It is a series of momentary acts of mind that alternate with active cognitive processes (cittavithi), sequences of cognition when the mind consciously appre­ hends an object. Hence the texts sometimes use the expression bhavangasota, "stream of bhavahga," to highlight the fluid nature of this type of mental process. The occurrence of the bhavUngais, most evident in deep, dreamless sleep, but it also occurs count­ less times in waking life between cognitive processes. . The most important events in the cognitive process are the javanacittas, ethically determinate occasions of consciousness that create kamma. The javanas may be either wholesome or unwholesome. It is in the javana phase that the defilements, dormant in the subconscious bhavahga, infiltrate mental activ­ ity and defile the mind. For a fuller discussion of the bhavahga, see CMA122-29, where it is rendered " life-con tinuum." Harvey (1995:166-79) has an interesting exploration of the relationship between the bhavahga and what he calls "the brightly shining mind." Mp explains: "The bhavangacitta is called luminous, that is, pure (parisuddha), because it is without defilements (nirupakkilesatfiya). It is defiled by adventitious defilements—by lust, etc.—which arise later [after the bhavahga] at the moment of javana. How? In the way that virtuous, well-behaved parents—or preceptor and teacher—get to be criticized and blamed on account of their undis­ ciplined, badly behaved children or pupils, [as when people say]: 'They don't punish, train, exhort, or instruct their own children or pupils/ Well-behaved parents, or preceptor and teacher, are like the bhavangacitta, while the blame falling on the parents because of their children [or on the preceptor and teacher on account of their pupils] is like the naturally pure bhavangacitta being defiled at the javana moment by the adventitious defilements that arise


-----

###### 1598 The Anguttara Nikaya

 in states of mind associated with greed, etc., which cause lust, hatred, and delusion to infect it." Though I quote Mp in full here, I find this explanation prob­ lematic on at least two grounds. The first is that the very concept of the bhavangacitta, and the corresponding notion of the cogni­ tive process, are not found in the Nikayas but first emerge in a later period when the Abhidhamma was taking shape. Even the term bhavanga,' though crucial to the Theravada Abhidhamma system, occurs only in the last book of the Abhidhamma Pitaka/ the Patthana. It is found much more often in the Abhidhamma commentaries. The second reason I find Mp's explanation problematic is that the text flatly states "this mind is luminous," without qualifica­ tion. This suggests that luminosity is intrinsic to the mind itself; and not to a particular type of mental event. Moreover, if the bhavanga \§ luminous, it. should always remain so; it becomes incoherent to speak of it being defiled by the javanas. The sim­ plest interpretation of this statement, so far as l ean see, is that luminosity is an innate characteristic of mind, seen in its capacity to illuminate its objective field. This luminosity, though inherent, is functionally blocked because the mind is "defiled by adven­ titious defilements" (agantukehi upakkilesehi upakkilittham). The defilements are called "adventitious" because, unlike the lumi­ nosity, they are not intrinsic to the mind itself. Of course, as 10:61 and 10:62 assert, there is no "first point" to ignorance and craving (and other defilements). But these defilements can be removed by mental training. With their removal, the mind's intrinsic luminosity emerges—or, more precisely, becomes manifest. The statement just below that the noble disciple understands the mind to be luminous impU.es that this insight into the intrin­ sic luminosity of the mind serves as the basis for further mental development, which liberates the mind from the defilements. With the complete removal of defilements, the mind's intrinsic luminosity shines forth unobstructed. At 3:102,1 257,7 the word pabhassara is used to describe the mh\d (citta) that has attained concentration (samadhi). It thus seems that it is in deep samadhi that the intrinsic luminosity of the mind emerges, at least temporarily. 5:23, III 16,29-17,2 says explicitly that the mind freed from the five hindrances is lumi­ nous (pabhassara) and properly concentrated for the destruction of the- taints. See too MN III 243,11-12, where it is equanimity (upekkha), presumably of the fourth jhana, that is described as luminous.

###### comprehension of mind" (cittatthiti cittapariggaho natthi). Mp-t: "The development of mind [called] 'stability of mind' (cittatthiti) is the practice through which one can accurately understand defilement of the mind and liberation from it. The development of insight (vipassanabhavana), which occurs based on the stabili­ zation [of the mind] by fully concentrating it on a single object, is what is known as comprehension of the mind (cittassa pcirig- gaha); [this occurs] together with the associated [mental] factors based on that object. It is through this that one can accurately understand the meaning stated." The Nikayas often set up a contrast between, the "uninstructed . worldling" (assutavci puthujjana), the common person of the world who lacks training in the Buddha's teaching, and the instructed noble- disciple (sutava ariya savaka), who has learned the teaching and undertaken the training. More broadly, a puthujjana is any­ one who has not yet reached the path of stream-entry (sotapatti). An ariyasavdka is not necessarily a "noble one" in the technical sense, but any disciple, monastic or layperson, who has learned tine teaching and earnestly takes up the practice. 48 Mp: "In this sutta powerful insight (balavavipassana) is discussed; but some say tender insight (tarunavipassana)." Here, "tender insight" refers to the early stage of knowledge of rise and fall, while "powerful insight" to the mature stage of knowledge of rise and fall and the higher insight knowledges. 49 Mp says that by "pursues a mind of loving-kindness" (mettacittam asevati), the text refers to the mere pervasion of all beings with a wish for their well-being. Thus it seems that here "not devoid of jhana" (arittajjha.no) does not necessarily mean that the monk actually attains one of the four jhanas but that he earnestly engages in meditation. The phrase "does not eat the country's almsfood in vain" means that by practicing meditation, the monk is worthy to receive almsfood from laypeople. He enables the donors to acquire merit and uses the almsfood properly to sup­ port the spiritual life. 50 Sabb'ete manopubbangama. Mp interprets this in line with the Abhidhamma doctrine that mind (citta) and its concomitants (cetasikas) occur simultaneously: "These [factors] arise together with mind (mano); they have a single arising, basis, cessation, and object. But because mind is what arouses, produces, generates, and originates them, they are said to have mind as their fore­ runner." Again, Mp reads this statement through the lens of the Abhidhamma analysis of mind. Understood in line with Dhp 1 and 2, the text probably means simply that before one commits


-----

###### in such a way. This gives the statement an ethical rather than a psychological meaning. This interpretation is supported by the next sentence about the mind arising first, followed by the others. The same applies to the wholesome mind and its qualities in the next sutta. ■ 51 Mp cites Vibh 350 (Be §846) for a definition of heedlessness (pamada): "What is heedlessness? Laxity of mind, looseness of mind, in regard to bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, mental misconduct, and the five kinds of sensual pleasures; and disre­ spect for the cultivation of wholesome qualities without perse­ vering and persisting in this. [It is] looseness of procedure, lack of desire, non-commitment, non-determination, non-devotion, non-pursuit, non-development, and non-cultivation [of whole­ some qualities]..'' 52 Mahicchata. Mp explains this as "strong greed" (mahalobho) and, . for a formal definition, it quotes Vibh 351 (Be §850): "What is strong desire? Lack of contentment, excessive desire with regard to robes, almsfood, dwelling places, medicines, and the five, objects of sensual pleasure. Such desire, desirousness> strong desire, lust, passion, mental passion, is called strong desire/' 53 Appicchata, Mp: "Whereas the expression [yfewness of desires'] might be taken to mean that there could be a residue [of desire], the meaning is that there is no residue. For one is not called 'of few desires' if one still has slight desire; it is through the absence of desire, through persistent greedlessness, that one is said to be of few desires." 54 Asantutthita. Mp: "This is the greed that arises from associating with, resorting to, and attending on discontented persons." 55 Santutthita. Mp distinguishes three types of contentment: (1) con­ tentment that accords with what one obtains (yathalabhasantosa), being content with any kind of robe (or other requisite) whether of fine or poor quality; (2) contentment that accords with one's ability (yathabalasantosa), being content with what one obtains but selecting for use those things most congenial to one's health; and (3) contentment with what is appropriate (yathasaruppasantosa), keeping the most basic gains for oneself and giving away the rest. For a translation of the full passage, see Bodhi 1989: 130-34. 56 Sampajannani. Here, Mp says only that this is a term for wisdom (panna). For a fuller treatment of sampajafiha according to the commentarial method, see Bodhi 1989: 94-130. 57 On the importance of good friendship (kalyanamittata) in the spiritual life, see 9:3.

The Ce arrangement has the advantage of keeping themati­ cally paired suttas together. 59 Ee titles the first.part of this vagga, constituted by the first thirty- two suttas, Catukotika, "Four -Pointed," and the second part, con­ sisting of the last ten suttas, Adhammadi, "Non-Dhamma, Etc." 60 Here, and in all the couplets through 1:113, I read with Ce and Be ekangampi over Ee ekadhammam pi. 61 Mp: "The ten courses of wholesome kamma are Dhamma; the ten courses of unwholesome kamma are non-Dhamma. So too, the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment— namely, the four establishments of mindfulness, the four right strivings, the four bases of spiritual power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven factors of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path— are Dhamma; three establishments of mindfulness, three right strivings, three bases of spiritual power, six faculties, six powers, eight factors of enlightenment, and a ninefold path [are non- Dhamma.] The four types of clinging, the five hindrances, the seven underlying tendencies> and the eight kinds of wrongness
 [the opposites of the noble path factors] are non-Dhamma. They teach non-Dhamma as Dhamma when they select one type of non-Dhamma and. think, 'We will teach this as Dhamma. In that way our teacher's group will be. emancipating, and we will become famous in the world.' By the Vinaya method, Dhamma is a disciplinary action that should be done according to the claim, after having reprimanded, after having reminded, according to a true base: Non-Dhamma is a disciplinary action done without a claim, without having reprimanded, without having reminded, according to a false base." 62 Mp: "By the sutta method, discipline (vinaya) means restraint, abandoning, reflection, and the removal of lust, hatred, and delusion. Non-discipline (avinaya) means-non-restraint, non­ abandoning, non-reflection, and the non-removal of lust, hatred, and delusion. By the Vinaya method, discipline is a proper base, motion, announcement, bounded area, and assembly. Non­ discipline is a defective base, motion, announcement, bounded area, and assembly." 63 Mp, in line with other commentaries, exp lains five kinds of disap­ pearance of the good Dhamma. I summarize: (1) Disappearance of attainment (adhigama-antaradhana): the gradual disappearance of attainment of the paths, fruits, and auxiliary attainments such as the analytical knowledges (patisambhida) and direct knowledges (abhinfia). (2) Disappearance of practice (patipatti-aniaradhana): the gradual disappearance of the jhanas, insight, paths, and fruits,


-----

###### Disappearance of learning (pariyatti-antaradhana): the gradual dis­ appearance of the Tipi taka, the Buddhist canon. (4) Disappearance of the emblem (linga-antaradhana): the gradual discarding of the renunciant robes until monastics wear merely a strip of ochre cloth around their necks. (5) Disappearance of the relics (dhatu- antaradhana): at the end of the Buddha Gotama's teaching, his relics all gather at the Bodhi tree at Bodhgaya, replicate the Bud­ dha's bodily form, and vanish in a blaze of glory. 64 Ee titles this vagga "The Eleventh." 65 Ee titles this vagga "Not an Offense, Etc/' By offense (apatti) is meant a transgression of monastic discipline. 66 Mp: "Five classes of offenses are called light (lahuka) and two are called grave (garuka, lit. "heavy"). Two are coarse and five are not coarse. Six classes are remediable and one is irremediable. Offenses with redress are the same as those that are remediable; the offenses, without redress are the same as those that are irre­ mediable." The two graveclasses of offenses are (1) the parajikas, which entail permanent expulsion from the Sahgha, and (2) the sahghadisesas,. which require formal meetings of the Sahgha and a complex process of rehabilitation. The five light classes are thul- laccaya (gross transgression), pacittiya (expiation), pat.idesa.nJya (to be acknowledged), dukkata (misdeed), and dubbhasita (bad speech). These can be exonerated by confession to another monk. The grave offenses are also called "coarse" (dutthulia); the light ones, not coarse (adutthulla). The parajikas are "irremediable"'
**(ianavasesa)** **and. "without redress"** **_(appatikamma), because they_**
###### do not allow for expiation; the other six classes are "remediable" (savasesa) and "with redress" (sappatikamma) because they can be cleared by expiation.

###### 71 I follow Ce.and Be, which take each utterance to be a separate sutta>and thus count twelve suttas here. Ee combines them into


-----

###### one. Since the last sentence recapitulates all the items from "the manifestation of great vision" to "the realization of the fruit of arahantship," it seems this was originally a single sutta. How­ ever, to keep my numbering in alignment with Ce and Be, I count each separately. 72 On the "six things unsurpassed" (cha anuttarlyani), see 6:30. On the four analytical knowledges (catasso patisambhidayo), see 4:172. These are discussed in detail at Vibh 293-305 (Be §§718-50) and Vism 440—42, Ppn 14.21-27. Mp explains the "penetration of numerous elements" (ahekadhatupativedha) by way of the eight­ een elements (six sense objects, six sense faculties, six types of consciousness), and the "penetration of the diversity of elements" (nanadhatupativedha) by way of their different specific natures (nanasabhavato). In the expression "fruit of true knowledge and liberation" (vijjavimuttiphala), Mp identifies true knowledge (vijja) with the knowledge of the fruit, and "liberation" (vimutti) with the other factors associated with, the fruit. Presumably this means the fruit of arahantship. 73 From here on, Ce and Be designate these divisions simply as —pali rather than —vagga, e.g., the title of this division is etadaggapali. Each group of ten (or more) suttas in the division is designated a vagga, named in Ce simply vaggo pathamo, vaggo dutiyo (first chap­ ter, second chapter), etc., and in Be pathamavaggo, dutiyavaggo,- etc. However, the major headings (ending in —pali) are numbered consecutively to the previous divisions called —vagga, which suggests that each can be considered a major vagga comprising several minor vaggas. Thus the present division is numbered XIV (or 14), following the ekapuggalavagga ("One Person Chap­ ter"), which was XIII (or 13). I follow Be and Ce in counting as a separate vagga or subchapter each group of ten (or more) suttas, each sutta being determined by the announcement of a particular disciple as foremost. Ee, in contrast, takes each grouping (sub­ chapter) as one large sutta. Many of the facts and references in my notes to these chapters have been gleaned from DPPN. 74 He was the first to understand the four noble truths at the Bud­ dha's first discourse, and the first to request admission to the Sahgha. See SN 56:11, V 423,13-16 and Vin I 11,34-36, 12,15-26. 75 For more detailed biographical accounts of Sariputta, Mahamoggallana, Mahakassapa, Anuruddha, and Mahakaccana, see Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003, chaps. 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, respectively. 76 By psychic potency (iddhi) is meant the supernormal powers described in 3:60,1 170; 3:101,1 255, and elsewhere. 77 The ascetic practices (dhuta, dhutahga) are often observed by


-----

###### monks for the sake of fewness of desires, being easy to sup­ port, and self-restraint. They indude living in the forest, at the foot of a tree, in the open air, or in a charnel ground; using only three robes; wearing "rag-robes" made from pieces of discarded cloth; eating only food obtained on alms round; and sleeping in the sitting posture. See 1:378-81,5:181-90. The standard thirteen ascetic practices are discussed in Vism chap. 2. 78 The divine eye (dibbacakkhu) is.the ability to see objects at remote distances, including distant world systems; to see other realms of existence; and to see beings dying and being reborn in accor­ dance with their kamma. 79 He was the son of Kaligodha, a senior Sakyan lady, and a close friend of Anuruddha, with whom he went forth. A story about him is in Ud 2:10, 18-20. His verses are at Th 842-65. 80 Born to a wealthy family of SavatthI, he was given the sobri­ quet lakuntaka (dwarf) due to his small stature. His attainment of arahantship is recounted in Ud 7:1, 74. He is praised in Ud 7:2, 74—75; Ud 7:5, 76; and SN 21:6, II 279. His verses are at Th 466-72. 81 He was the son of the chaplain of King Udena of Kosambl. When he visited Rajagaha and saw the gains that accrued to the bhikkhus, he decided to become a monk. In his early days as a bhikkhu he was gluttonous, but the Buddha taught him to be moderate in eating. He soon attained arahantship with the six direct knowledges. He was rebuked by the Buddha for using his psychic powers to win a sandalwood bowl (Vjn II 110-12). He converses with King Udena about sense restraint at SN 35:127, IV 110-13. He is praised in Ud 4:6, 42—43. His verses are at Th 123-24. 82 A nephew of Annakondanna, he was from a brahmin family that lived near Kapilavatthu, the Buddha's native city. After he attained arahantship he went to see the Buddha in SavatthI. Sariputta met him and they had a discussion on the Dhamma, preserved in MN 24. He was praised by Ananda for his skill as a teacher at SN 22:83, III 105-6. 83 His story is told at Vism 387—89, Ppn 12.60—66. Because he was bom by a roadside (pantha), he was given the name Panthaka. He is praised in Ud 5:10, 61. His verses are at Th 557—66. 84 He was the elder brother of Cullapanthaka, also bom by a road­ side. Being elder, when his brother was born he was called Maha (large, great) and his brother Culla (small). His verses are at Th 510-17. Mp says that Cullapanthaka was particularly skilled in concentration and was therefore the foremost in mental trans­ formation (cetovivatta). Mahapanthaka was particularly skilled in


-----

###### insight and was therefore foremost in the transformation of per­ ception (sannavwatta). Mp-t explains the difference thus: "One skilled in mental transformation is an attainer of the form-sphere jhanas who, in regard to a single object, is able to transform the mind of concentration (samadhicittam) from successively lower jhanas to successively higher ones. One skilled in transforma­ tion of perception is skilled in transforming the aforesaid jhanas under the heading of perception, passing beyond the perceptions of form and moving from [the perception] associated with the base.of the infinity of space to that associated with the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. Similarly, he is able to transform the mind from the perception of women and men, etc., and from the perception of permanence, etc., toward mere form and formless phenomena and, especially, toward the uncondi­ tioned nibbana. Such a one is accustomed to the contemplation of emptiness (sunhatanupassanabahulo)." 85 He was Anathapindika's younger brother, who went forth on the day the Jetavana monastery was dedicated to the Buddha. He attained arahantship by developing insight based on the medita­ tion of loving-kindness. Before teaching the Dhamma and when receiving almsfood, he would first enter jhana through loving- kindness and then emerge. The Buddha explains to him the man­ ifestations of faith at 11:14, His skill in meditation is praised in Ud 6:7, 71. His verse is at Th 1. Subhuti figures prominently in the [Mahayana] Prajnaparamita sutras as chief exponent of the perfection of wisdom. 86 He was Sariputta's youngest brother. Compelled by his mother to marry when still young, he ran away and received ordination. His verses are at Th 646-58. 87 He was from a very wealthy family of SavatthI. His conception of the ideal bhikkhu is at MN 32.5,1213,10-19. He is praised in Ud 5:7, 60. He has his own verse at Th 3. 88 The story of his awakening is at 6:55, told more elaborately at Vin 1179—85,. where it leads to the Buddha's granting permission to the bhikkhus to wear sandals. His verses are at Th 632—44. 89 He was from AvantI, the son of Kali (see 1:267 below) and a pupil of Mahakaccana. His story is told in Ud 5:6, 57-59. He traveled to SavatthI to see the Buddha. The Buddha invited him to spend the night in his cottage and praised him for his recitation of the Atthakavagga. His verses are at Th 365-69. 90 He was the son of Suppavasa, in whose womb he remained for seven years and seven days. He emerged only after his mother made an offering to the Buddha (see Ud 2:8, 15-18, though the infant is identified by name only in the commentary). He went


-----

###### forth on the day of his birth and became a once-returner just as his hair was being cut. Thereafter he attained arahantship. His verse is at Th 60. 91 The story of his love for the Buddha and his death by suicide is told at SN 22:87, Hi 119-24. 92 The Buddha's son. His first encounter with his father, when he was seven, is related at Vin I 82,8-31. The Buddha addresses the following discourses to him: MN 61, MN 62, MN 147; SN 18:1—22; SN 22:91-92; SN 35:121 (= MN 147); and Sn 2:11. 93 His story and his discourse on the Dhamma are at MN 82. His verses are at Th 350—54. . . . . 94 Patharitam salakam ganhantanam. This refers to a method of assign­ ing meals by choosing lots. He seldom appears in the Nikayas but has a verse at Th 15 (= SN 1:5,13, ascribed to the Buddha).. 95 A whole chapter about him, including his verses, is SN chap. 8. See too Sn 2:12. His verses, Th 1218-88, make up the largest section in the Theragatha. 96 A younger brother of Sariputta, he rejoices in.his achievements in Ud 4:9, 45-46. An account of-his death by snakebite is in SN 35:69, IV 40—41. His verses are at Th 577-86. 97 He is said to have attained arahantship at the age of seven. He was selected by the Sangha to be the appointer of lodgings and assigner of meals but was subsequently calumnied by a group of evil-minded bhikkhus (at Vin III 158-63 and again at Vin III 166.-67; see too Vin II74—80,124-26). He is maligned by the same group at Vin IV 37-38. The story of his passing away is in Ud 8:9—10, 92—93. He has a single verse at Th 5. 98 He had been a brahmin in five hundred past lives and even after his ordination and attainment of arahantship,. by force of habit he still referred to other bhikkhus by the derogatory term vasala. The Buddha exonerated him of wrongdoing (in Ud 3:6, 28—29). His supernormal powers are described at Vin 1206-9; III 67,9-17; III 248-51. He has a single verse at Th 9 (identical with Angulimala's verse at Th 885). 99 His story is told in Ud 1:10, 65-9 . Before he met the Buddha, he had lived as an ascetic, convinced he was an arahant until a benevolent deity disabused him of this notion. He hastened to visit the Buddha in Savatthi. Upon receiving the Buddha's teach-
 • ing he immediately attained arahantship. He was killed by a cow shortly after his attainment. Though he did not receive formal ordination, he is still considered a bhikkhu. 100 He was the son of a woman who became a bhikkhuni while Unknowingly pregnant with him. He went forth at the age of seven. He appears in DN 23 and MN 23. His verses are at Th

 of variegated speech (cittakathikanam aggo) because he adorned his Dhamma talks with many similes and reasons. 101 He appears in numerous suttas, usually questioning Sariputta: MN 43; SN 12:67; SN 22:122; SN 22:127-35; SN 35:232; SN 44:3-6. At SN 35:162-63 he receives instructions directly from the Bud­ dha. On the analytical knowledges (patisambhidcL), see 4:172. 102 During the last twenty-five years of the Buddha's life he served as the Buddha's personal attendant. For a biographical account, see Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003, chap. 4. In Th 1027, he claims that he learned 84,000 teachings: 82,000 from the Buddha and 2,000 from the bhikkhus. . 103 Mp: "Based on a single passage, grasping 60,000 passages according to the method explained by the Teacher, he knew all . the passages. Therefore he was foremost among those with a quick grasp (gatimantanam aggo)/' 104 Mp: "His energy in learning the Buddha's words, in recitation, in retention, and in attending.upon the Teacher was unequaled by others. Therefore he was foremost among those who are resolute (idhitimantanam aggo)." 105 He was the head of a company of matted-hair fire ascetics whom the Buddha converted early in his ministry. His two younger brothers, Nadikassapa and Gayakassapa, who were also fire ascetics, followed him to discipleship under the Buddha. See Vin.I 24—37. His verses are at Th 375-80. 106 The son of one of Suddhodana's ministers, he had been a child­ hood playmate of the Buddha. He was sent by Suddhodana to invite the Buddha to return to Kapilavatthu. During this mission he inspired the Sakyans to have faith in the Buddha. His verses are at Th 527—36. 107 He was swallowed by a fish as a child but miraculously survived. See Vism 379, Ppn 12.27. He became a monk at the age of eighty and attained arahantship in seven days. His conversation with a friend, Acelakassapa, is recorded as MN 124. His verses are at Th 225-27. 108 He was a brahmin from SavatthI. His verses are at Th 165—66. 109 He had been the barber of the Sakyans in Kapilavatthu. He went forth along with Anuruddha and his cousins and became the foremost specialist in monastic discipline. He appears frequently in the Vinaya and in AN at 7:83, 10:31-38, 10:41-43, and 10:99. His verses are at Th 249—51. 110 A former householder from SavatthI, he exhorts the bhikkhunls at MN 146. In AN, see 3:66 and 9:4. His verses are at Th 279-82. 111 He was the Buddha's half-brother, son of Suddhodana and


-----

###### the Buddha at SN 21:8 and praised in AN at 8:9. His verses are at Th 157-58- 112 He was the king of a frontier country who gave up his throne to follow the Buddha. His wife, Anoja, along with her attendants followed him and became a bhikkhuni. He is praised by the Bud­ dha at SN 21:11 and SN 54:7. His verses are at Th 547-56. 113 He was one of the Buddha's a ttendants prior to Ananda. He used his mastery over the fire element to subdue a ferocious fire dragon at Amba Ford, near Kosambi. On the instructions of the group of six troublesome bhikkhus, .the. householders of Kosambi pre­ pared an intoxicating brew called kapotika for Sagata. He drank it and fell down in a drunken stupor. In response, the Buddha laid down the rule against drinking intoxicants (Pacittiya 5.1); see Vin IV 108 -10. . . 114 The word patibhancyyaka apparently has a causative sense. Mp says "he was the foremost of the bhikkhus who cause elo­ quent discourses on the Dhamma to be spoken by the Bud­ dha, those who are a condition for such discourses" (s'atthu. dhammadesanapatibhanassa paccayabhutanam patibhanajanakanam ■
 • bhikkhunam ... aggo). He receives discourses from the Buddha at . SN 22:71, SN 23:1-46, and SN 35;76-78. 115 He was one of the sixteen brahmin students who questioned the Buddha in the Parayanavagga. His exchange with the Buddha is at Sn 1116-19. He asks a question of the Buddha at SN 1:34, I 23, and has a verse at Th 207. 116 She was the Buddha's aunt and foster mother. In AN, see 8:51 ( - Vin II253-56) and 8:53 (= Vin II258-59). Her verses are at ThI 157-62, and the story of her passing away at Ap II 529-43. 117 For a biographical sketch, see Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003: 263-97. She had been a consort of King Bimbisara, proud of her beauty, but went forth after the Buddha dispelled her vanity. She gives a discourse at SN 44:1 and has verses at ThI 139-44. Along with Uppalavanna, she was one of the two chief bhikkhuni dis­ ciples who are held up as models for bhikkhunls in AN in 2:131 and 4:176 §2 and in SN 17:24. 118 She had been the daughter of'a banker of SavatthI. Shortly after going forth, she attained arahantship together with the psychic powers. She was raped by a young man but the Bud­ dha declared her faultless because she did not consent to the act. She exchanges words with Mara at SN 5:5,1 131-32: Her verses are at ThI 224—35. 119 Her story is in Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003: 293—300. Her verses are at ThI 112-16.


-----

###### 120 She teaches her former husband in MN 44 and has a verse at Thi.12.. 121 Also known as Sundarlnanda because of her beauty, she was the Buddha's half-sister and the full sister of Nanda. Her story is in Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003: 282-85. She has verses at ThI 82-86. 122 Her story is in Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003: 279-82. Her verses are at ThI 102-6. 123 She was the daughter of a brahmin family of Savatthi. Her verses are at ThI 98-101. 124 Her story is in Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003: 269-73. She had been a wandering ascetic and debater before she met the Buddha., Her verses are at ThI 107—11. 125 In lay life she had been the wife of Mahakassapa> but by mutual . consent their marriage was never consummated. Her verses are at Thi 63-66. 126 Mp identifies her as Rahulamata, the mother of Rahula; hence . she was the Buddha's wife, better known in Buddhist tradition by the name Yasodhara. • 127 She is the protagonist in the famous $tory. of the mustard seed. Her biographical sketch is in Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003: 273-78. She has a dialogue with Mara at SN 5:3, I 129-30. Her verses are at Thi 213-23. 128 She is said to have attained arahantship by giving prominence to the faculty of faith; hence her appointment as foremost of those resolved through faith. 129 Their encounter with the Buddha sopn after his enlightenment is related at Vin I 4 , 1-27. They are said to have been from the Ukkala country. They provided the Buddha with his first meal after his enlightenment and went for refuge to the Buddha and the Dhamma (since the Sahgha did not yet exist). Mp explains that the Buddha gave them some hairs from his head, which they brought to their native city and deposited in a cetiya (memorial shrine) that they built to accommodate them. 130 For a detailed account of his life and activities, see Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003, chap. 9. 131 He is the chief figure in SN chap. 41. For a biographical sketch, see Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003: 365-72. 132 Mp says that he was the son of the king of the state of Alavi. On hearing the Buddha teach he became a non-returner. In AN he engages the Buddha in conversation at 3:35 and, with Citta, is held up as a model lay follower at 2:132 and 4:176 §3 as well as at SN 17:23, II 235,20 25. He is praised by the Buddha at 8:23 and 8:24. After his rebirth as a deity, he comes to visit the Buddha

 at 3:127. The four means of attracting and sustaining others (sangahavatthu) are at 4:32. 133 He was a Sakyan prince, the elder brother of Anuruddha and a cousin of the Buddha. He often engages in discussions with the Buddha and other bhikkhus. In AN he appears in 3:73, 3:126, 6:10, 8:25,11:11, and 11:12. 134 He is praised by the Buddha in 8:21 and speaks about the agree­ able things, that he offers in 5:44. 135 From the account in Mp, he seems to be identical with Ugga of Hatthigama, praised by the Buddha in 8;22. 136 Mp relates a. story of how Mara came to visit him in the guise of the Buddha to try to. shake his confidence. Sura, however, at once realized the deceit and exposed his visitor as Mara. 137 He was court physician to King Bimbisara as well as to the Bud­ dha and the Sahgha. In AN he appears only in 8:26. The story of his early career and his service to the Buddha is told at Vin I 268-81. On the expression "foremost of those with confidence in persons" (puggaiappasannanam aggo), Mp offers merely a word resolution. The intended sense, 1 assume, is that his confidence was based largely on personal confidence in the Buddha rather than on inquiry into the Dhamma. 138 According to Mp, he and his wife Nakulamata had been the Buddha's parents in five hundred past lives and thus they still regarded him as their son. This, I believe, was what qualified them to be "foremost in trust" (vissasakanam aggo). In AN they appear together in 4:55 and 6:16. A brief biographical sketch of the couple is given in Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003: 375—78. 139 She offered the bodhisatta his last meal before his enlightenment. Mp identifies her as the mother of Yasa (see Vin I 15-18), but this seems improbable. Sujata was from Uruvela, near present- day Bodhgaya, whereas Yasa is said to have been from distant Baranasl. 140 She was the Buddha's chief female patron. A biographical sketch is in Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003: 247—55. The Buddha gives discourses to her in 3:70, 8:43, 8:47, and 8:49. 141 The servant of Samavatl, she would go to hear the Buddha preach and repeat the discourses to the ladies of the court. The Itivuttaka is said to be the record of these teachings. In 2:133 and at 4:176 §4 she is held up, along with VelukantakI Nandamata, as the ideal model for a female lay follower. She is also praised in SN 17:24. 142 Orphaned as a girl, she became the wife of King Udena of Kosambl. Together with the women of the court, she died when

 on fire. The story is in Ud 7:10, 79. Her biographical sketch is in Nyanaponika and Hecker 2003: 285—93. 143 She is probably identical with Velukantaki Nandamata,.who, while held up elsewhere as an ideal lay woman, is not men­ tioned in this list. Velukantaki Nandamata is praised along with Khujjuttara in the suttas cited above in note 141. In 7:53 she speaks about her seven astounding qualities. 144 She was the mother of Sivall. The story of her long pregnancy is in Ud 2:8,15-18. The Buddha instructs her about the efficacy of giving food in 4:57. 145 She sliced.flesh from her own thigh to feed a sick bhikkhu who needed meat. This caused the Buddha to prohibit the bhikkhus from consuming human flesh, even if willingly given. See Vin I 216 -18. . 146 Mp says that she was a close friend of Kali of Kuraraghara. One day, while she was listening to a Dhamma discourse, thieves came to rob her house. She did not show any concern about the robbery but continued listening to the discourse. Her reaction caused the thieves to repent. With her help, they became monks and attained arahantship. 147 She was the wife of Nakulapita. She reveals her virtues in 6:16 and receives a personal discourse from the Buddha in 8:48. 148 A supporter.of Mahakaccana, she converses with him in 10:26. Mp says that she gained trust when she heard two yakkhas (spirits) speaking praise of the Three Jewels while traveling through the sky. She thereupon attained the fruit of stream-entry. . 149 Be divides the twenty-eight suttas in this vagga into three sub­ chapters of ten, nine, and nine suttas respectively. Ce, which I follow, treats them all as one vagga named AtthanapdlL Many of these utterances are also found in MN 115.12-19, III 64-67. 150 Mp: "One accomplished in view (ditthisampanna) is a noble disciple, a stream-enterer, possessing the view of the path (maggaditthiya sampanna). The worldling, in contrast, can consider the condi­ tioned phenomena of the three planes [the sensory plane, the form plane, and the formless plane] as permanent by way of the eternalist view (sassataditthi)" 151 Mp: "This is said with reference to the obsession with pleasure that occurs by way of the view of self {attaditthivcisena), as in those who hold that the self is exclusively blissful and immortal, etc. But, with a mind dissociated from views (ditthivippayuttacittcna), a noble disciple afflicted with fever might regard even feces as pleasurable, believing it can allay his fever/' 152 Mp: "In the section on self, instead of speaking of a 'condi­ tioned phenomenon' (sankhara), the expression 'anything' (kanci


-----

###### dhammam) is used; this is for the purpose of including concep­ tual entities such as the kasinas, etc. (see 1:455—64). Whatever the worldling grasps as permanent, pleasurable, and self, the noble disciple disentangles himself from its grip, considering it as impermanent, suffering, and rion-self." 153 The first five are the heinous deeds that bring immediate result (dnantariya kamma), necessarily producing rebirth in hell in the next existence. The five are mentioned collectively in 6:94. The six items together are referred to at Sn 233 as "the six things that cannot be done" (cha cabhithanani abhabbo katum) by the stream-enterer. Mp; "This here is the intention: 'The condition of a worldling is blameworthy insofar as a worldling can do these deeds that bring immediate results, such as matricide and so forth. But the noble disciple is powerful since he does not do such deeds/" Regarding the shedding of a Tathagata's blood, Mp says that the expression "with a mind of hatred" (padutthacitto) is used to highlight the motive. Devadatta, who wanted to kill the Buddha and take control of the Sangha, wounded the Bud­ dha in a failed assassination attempt and thereby committed an anantariya kamma. But the physician Jivaka, wishing to restore the Buddha's health, cut his skin to extract bad blood; he thereby did a meritorious deed. On schism in the Sangha (sanghabheda), see 10:37,10:39. 154 This is redundant, since samma sambuddha means simply "a perfectly enlightened one," but I render the term thus to avoid rrtisunderstanding. Though arahant disciples achieve samhodhi, full enlightenment, and are occasionally spoken of as sambuddha, "enlightened," the designation samma sambuddha is reserved for the founder, who alone attains anuttara samma sambodhi, "unsur­ passed perfect enlightenment." 155 Mp explains the word "contemporaneously" (apubbam acarimam, lit., "not before, not after") to cover the period from the time a bodhisatta enters his mother's womb until the Buddha's relics disappear. There can be only one Buddha at a time because a Buddha is without a counterpart or peer (see 1:172,1:174). Thus if two Buddhas were to arise simultaneously, this statement would be invalidated. The issue is also dealt with at Mil 236-39, cited by Mp. Mp says that because no suttas speak of the arising of Buddhas in other world systems, while there are suttas that say Buddhas do not arise elsewhere, it is only in this world system (imasmimyeva cak.kavS.le) that they arise. Mp-t cites several suttas that it interprets as excluding the possibility of Buddhas arising elsewhere, but these texts do not seem to be as categorical as the author supposes Perhaps this argument was intended to

 even among other pre-Mahayana schools) that Buddhas arise in the world systems of the ten directions. For the early Buddhist view on world systems, see 3:81. 156 A "wheel-turning monarch" (raja cakkavatt) is an ideal king who conquers the lands of the four directions by his righteousness. In AN he is mentioned in 3:14, 5:131—33, 7:62, and 7:66. For details, see MN 129.33-47, III 172-77. 157 It seems that in the old Nikayas the idea of aspiring for future Buddhahood is not raised at all. Thus the claim being made here is not that a woman cannot become a perfectly enlightened Bud­ dha in a future life but that a Buddha is always male. The asser- ; . tion in this sutta need not be read as excluding the possibility that one who is presently a woman could become a Buddha, but this would have to take place in a future life, after she has undergone a change of gender. The statements are no doubt formulated in the context of the Indian culture of the period/ which always assigned positions of authority to males. MA 181, a Chinese parallel of MN 115/ does not include the section on the inabilities of women. Nevertheless, we do find the declara­ tion that a woman cannot become a Buddha in another Chinese parallel of the sutta, at T XVII 713b2o-22. It also occurs in a sQtra quoted in the Abhidharma Mahavibhasa at T XXVI 502bi6-i8, and in the *Sariputrabhidharma Sastra at T XXVIII, 600bio-i2. Accord­ ing to such later canonical texts as the Buddhavamsa, if a woman resolves to attain Buddhahood in the presence of a Buddha, her resolution does not succeed (i.e., she does not receive tile predic­ tion of future Buddhahood). For the resolution to succeed, the aspirant must be a male who has left the home life. See Bodhi 2007: 251—53. Sakka is the ruler of the devas in the Tavatimsa heaven. 158 The words in brackets pertain respectively to the two suttas that are abridged in this triad. The same applies to the following two triads. 159 Ce and Be divide this chapter (called Ekadhammapah) into sepa­ rate subchapters (called vaggas), as shown, whereas Ee treats the subchapters of Ce and Be as independent vaggas. 160 Mp: "Disenchantment (nibbida) is dissatisfaction with the round
 [of rebirths]; dispassion (viraga) is the fading away of the round, or the fading away of such defilements as lust (raga); cessation (nirodha) is the ceasing of lust, etc., or the ceasing of the round; peace (upasama) is the stilling of defilements; direct knowledge (abhinna) is directly knowing the three characteristics; enlighten­ ment (sambodha) is awakening to the four truths; and nibbana is

###### recollections described more fully at 6:10 and elaborated at Vism 197-213, Ppn 7.1-67. Here is Mp (abridged): "Recollection of the Buddha serves two purposes: giving joy to the mind and promot­ ing insight (cittasampahamsanatthan c'eva vipassanatthanca). How? When a bhikkhu develops a meditation subject like unattractive­ ness [of the body], his mind may be disturbed, dissatisfied, and joyless. It does not remain on track but roams around like a wild bull. On that occasion, he should put aside his basic meditation subject and recollect the excellent qualities of the Tathagata. As he recollects the Buddha, his mind becomes placid and free from . hindrances. He can then return to his basic meditation object, . develop insight, and reach the plane of the noble Ones. Thus recollection of the Buddha gives joy to the mind. But one can also . use this meditation subject directly for the purpose of developing insight. After recollecting the Buddha, one dissects the act of rec-. ollection into the five aggregates and defines them thus: /These . five aggregates are, in brief, the truth of suffering. The craving that produced them is the truth of the origin. The cessation of craving is the truth of cessation; and; the practice that under­ stands cessation is the truth of the path/ Thus one has defined the four truths in the preliminary portion [the stage of insight] and one step by step reaches the stage of the noble ones/' 162 In Be these nine suttas are combined into one, numbered 297 in Be's cumulative numbering scheme. In Ce and Ee, they are numbered 2-10 (since these editions number the first sutta in each vagga as "1" without cumulative numbering). I follow Be in using a cumulative numbering scheme, but I follow' Ce and Ee in counting these suttas separately. Thus my numbering scheme from here on will exceed Be by eight, but without being matched by any corresponding scheme in Ce or Ee. In parentheses I give the sutta number internal to the subchapters, called vaggas, but simply enumerated without proper title. 163 The meditation subjects from recollection of the Dhamma through recollection of the devas are the other five recollections, also discussed in 6:10 §§2-6 and elaborated at Vism 213-26, Ppn 7.68—118. Mindfulness of breathing (anapanassati) is dealt with more fully at 10:60 §10, SN 54:10, V 322-25, and SN 54:13, V 328-33. For the commentarial treatment, see Vism 267-93, Ppn 8.145-244. Mindfulness of death (maranassati) is at 6:19,6:20,8:73, and 8:74, elaborated at Vism 229—39, Ppn 8.1—41. Mindfulness directed to the body (kayagata sati), as the unattractive nature of the body, is at 10:60 §3, and elaborated at Vism 239-66, Ppn 8.42—144. Recollection of peace (upasamanussati) occurs only here and is not separately explained but is treated at Vism 293-94

 Ppn 8.245-51; this treatment closely resembles the perception of dispassion and the perception of cessation at 10:60 §§6-7. 164 In Ee called vagga XVII and named "Seed" (Blja). 165 Mp: "This is a designation for the sixty-two wrong views"; see DN 1.1.29—3.31,112-39. It seems, though, that the term micchaditthi is used in the Nikayas solely in relation to three views: moral nihil­ ism, the doctrine of non-doing, and the doctrine of non-causality (natthikavada, akiriyavada, ahetukavada). 166 Mp: "This is a designation for the five kinds of right view." Mp-t: "[The views of] ownership of kamma, jhana, insight, the path, and the fruit. The knowledge included in the jhana conscious­ ness is the right view of jhana, while insight knowledge is the right view of insight." 167 See 2rl25,10:93. 168 See 2:126, MN 43.13,1 294,i-^. 169 Ce considers this sutta and the next to contain seven suttas each: one each for bodily, verbal, and mental kamma, and for volition, yearning/aspiration, and volitional activities. Thus Ce counts twenty-tWo suttas for this section, as against ten in Be and Ee. 170 Nimbabljam va kosatakibTjam va tit taka lab ubijarn va. 171 Asecanakatta. Lit., "not causing surfeit." 172 Ee counts this as vagga XVIII, named "Makkhali." 173 Mp: "Devadatta together with the six [non-Buddhist] teachers and others who are similar." For the views of the six teachers, see DN 2.16-33,1 52-59. 174 Mp: "When a Buddha has not arisen, this is a bodhisatta in the role of a wheel-turning monarch and others who are similar. When a Buddha has arisen, it is a Buddha and his disciples." 175 Makkhali Gosala was one of the six teachers contemporary with the Buddha. He was the founder (or perhaps just an eminent teacher) of the Ajlvakas (or Ajivikas). DN 2.20, I 53-54 ascribes to him the doctrine of non-causality (ahetukavada), according to which there is no cause for the defilement or purification of beings, who have no energy, self-control, or capacity for free choice.. 176 Manussakhippam. Mp: "He has arisen in the world like a fish net for people, to prevent them from reaching the path leading to heaven and liberation." 177 Dayakena matta janitabba no patiggahakena. Mp: "One should give within measure. One should not give fully, in excess. He [the Buddha] does not say 'one should not give/ but 'one should give a little, moderately/ Why? Because even if one gives fully, in excess, one does not achieve [as the fruit of one's gift] the

 of nibbana. There is no need for the recipient to be moderate in receiving. Why? Because he does not have to be moderate when things are being given to him fully; he does not practice fewness of wishes based on receiving in moderation/' 178 Patiggahakena mattajanitabba. Mp: "The person receiving should set the limit. How? By taking into account the donor, the item to be given, and one's own capacity. For if the item to be given is plentiful, and the donor wishes to give a little, out of consid­ eration for the donor one should accept a little. If there is only a little to be given, and the donor wishes to give a lot, out of consideration for the item to be given one should accept a little. If the item to be given is plentiful, and the donor wishes to give a lot, out of consideration for one's own capacity one should accept moderately. Having thus known moderation, the recipi­ ent fulfills the practice of fewness of wishes. [In this way] those who did not get a share get one, and the gains acquired remain stable. Those without confidence acquire confidence; .those with confidence increase in confidence; one becomes an example for the multitude; and one helps the Teaching to continue for a long time." 179 Mp explains that after the Buddha had given a discourse on the rebirth of beings, saying that there are nine persons "freed from hell, the animal realm, and the sphere of afflicted spirits" (see 9:12), he considered: "If the bhikkhus, on hearing this discourse, think: 'We are freed from hell, etc./ they may think there is no need to strive for the. higher paths and fruits. Let me then stir up a sense of urgency in them." Mp glosses the words, "I do not praise even a trifling amount of existence," with: "I do not praise rebirth in any realm of existence even for a short time" (appamat- takampi kalarn bhave patisandhim na vannayami). 180 Ce and Ee count these as four separate suttas, whereas Be com­ bines them into one. 181 Ce gives this vagga the title jambudipapeyyalo, the "Jambudlpa Repetition Series." Ee counts this as vagga XIX and names it Appamattakam, "Few." Be simply calls it Catutthavaggo, "The Fourth (Sub-) Chapter." 182 Ce counts fifteen suttas in this first series; Be, by combining the second and third suttas, counts fourteen; Ee counts them all as one sutta. 183 Jambudlpa: the "Rose-Apple Continent," the southern continent in Buddhist geography. The other three continents are Apara- goyana to the west, Uttarakuru to the north, and Pubbavideha to the east. Mp says Jambudlpa is named after the "great rose-apple

 PED estimates a yojana to be seven miles; SED gives several alter­ natives but takes nine miles to be the most accurate. 184 The " middle provinces" (majjhima janapada) correspond roughly to the northeastern and north-central states of present-day India. Mp cites Vin I 197,20-29, for an exact specification of its boundar­ ies. It is said that Buddhas, paccekabuddhas, great disciples, etc., are born only here. Everything beyond these bounds is called the "outlying provinces" (paccantima janapada). That the definitions are flexible is seen in Mp's statement that all of Jambudipa can also be called the middle region and the other continents the out­ lying provinces. In Sri Lanka (in the time of the commentators), the Anuradhapura district was considered the middle region and the rest of the country the outlying provinces. On mleccha (the Skt equivalent of Pali milakkha), SED offers: "a foreigner, barbarian, non-Aryan, man of an outcast race, any person who does not speak Sanskrit and does not conform to the usual Hindu institutions." 185 Mp: "The noble eye ofzvisdom (ariyapannacakkhu): the path together with irisight." 186 Ce and Be ete va satta. bahutara ye atthamannaya dhammamannaya dhammanudhammam na patipajjanti; Ee ete va satta bahutara ye na attham annaya na dhammam annaya dhammanudhammam na . patipajjanti. I assume that in Ce and Be the negation na precedirtg the finite verb is intended to apply distributively to the preceding absolutives. The Ee reading is supported by an older Sri Lankan printed edition. 187 Samvejaniyesu thanesu samvijjanti. Ona sense of urgency (samvega), see 3:128, 4:113. The commentaries enumerate "eight bases of the sense of urgency" (attka samvegavatthuni): birth, old age, ill­ ness, death; the suffering in the realms of misery; the suffering rooted in one's samsaric past; the suffering to be encountered in one's samsaric future; and the suffering rooted in the search for nutriment. See Sv III 795,6-9, Ps 1298,24-28, Spk III 163,-23 26, Mp II 68,9-12. 188 Mp: "Based on release (vavassaggarammanam karitva): release is nibbana. The meaning is: having made that the object. Gain con­ centration (labhanti samadhim): they obtain concentration of the path and concentration of the fruit." I am not sure the expression vavassaggarammanam karitva need be interpreted in the techni­ cal sense (employed in the Abhidhamma) of the path and frui­ tion cittas taking nibbana as their object. The expression is also used in the definition of the concentration faculty at SN 48:9-10 (V 197,14-16, V 198,24-25). It may originally have meant simply a

 five spiritual faculties are often described as vossaggaparinamim, "evolving toward release" or "maturing in release," vossngga and vavassagga being alternative forms of the same word. 189 Mp identifies the "taste of the meaning" (atthnrasa) with the four fruits, the "taste of the Dhamma" (dhammarasa) with the four paths, and the taste of liberation (vimuttirasa) with the deathless nibbana (amatanibbana). See 8:19: "This Dhamma and discipline has but one taste, the taste of liberation" (ayam dhammavinayo ekaraso vimuttiraso). Again, Mp seems to impose on the sutta technical distinctions formulated only in a later period. 190 Ce and Be, which I follow, count thirty suttas in this group. Ee merges them into one. 191 These suttas correspond closely to SN 56:102—31, V 474—77. 192 Ee treats these suttas as the beginning of vagga XX, Jhdnavagga, "The Jhana Chapter." Ce treats them as the fifth subchapter of vagga XVI, designated Solasapasadakaradhamma, "Sixteen Quali­ ties Engendering Confidence/' Be groups them as vagga XVII, named Pasadakaradhammavagga, "Chapter on Qualities Engen­ dering Confidence." 193 The observances in 1:378-381 are ascetic practices (dhutanga) permitted by the Buddha. 194 Ee treats this as a continuation of vagga XX. Ce takes it to be the sixth subchapter of vagga XVI, but gives it a separate name, as if it were a new chapter, Accharasahghatavaggo, "The Fin­ ger Snap Chapter." Be counts it as vagga XVIII, called Apara- accharasanghatavaggo, "Another Finger Snap Chapter." In. Be, vagga VI is "The First Finger Snap Chapter." 195 These are the four jhanas followed by the four divine dwellings (brahmavihcira). 196 These are the four establishments of mindfulness (satipatthana), followed by the other groups in the thirty-seven aids to enlight­ enment: the four right strivings (sammappadhana), the four bases for psychic potency (iddhipada), the five faculties (indriya), the five powers (bala), the seven factors of enlightenment (bojjhanga), and the noble eightfold path (ariya atthangika magga). 197 The Pali phrase kaye kayanupassi viharati is usually translated either as I have rendered it here or as "[he] dwells contemplating the body as a body." The question is sometimes raised which of these two is more accurate. I believe that 7:6, IV 13—15, supports my rendering here. We there read ekacco puggalo sabbasahkharesu amccanupassl viharati, and in the following suttas: sabbasankharesu dukkhanupassi viharati, sabbadhammesu anattanupassl viharati, and nibbdhe sukhanupa$sl viharati. These are best rendered: "Some

 phenomena/' "dwells contemplating suffering in all conditioned phenomena," "dwells contemplating non-self in all phenom­ ena," and "dwells contemplating happiness in nibbana." They could not be rendered: "Some person dwells contemplating impermanence as all conditioned phenomena" ... "contemplat­ ing happiness as nibbana." In each case, the. word conjoined with anupassT is the aspect that is contemplated, and the word in the locative case is the sphere in relation to which that aspect is contemplated. Analogously, in kaye kayanupassi vihaniti, the. km/a conjoined with anupassT is the aspect that is contemplated (the "bodiness" of the body) and the locative kaye is the domain in relation to which that aspect is contemplated. Strictly speaking kayanupassi does not actually mean "contemplating the body," but "a body-contemplator." Thus a very literal translation of the phrase would be: "He dwells as a body-contemplator in relation to the body." Since such a rendering would sound awkward in English, I fall back on the familiar "contemplating the body in the body." Similar considerations apply to. the other three satipatthanas. • 198 These are the eight bases of overcoming (abhibhayatana). For explanations, see 8:65 and pp. 1808-9, notes 1771-75. 199 These are the eight emancipations (vimokkha). See 8 :6 6 and pp. 1809-10, notes 1776-80. 200 A kasina. is an object, often a disk, used as a support for medita- . tion. For example, the earth kasina is a disk of brown clay on which the meditator focuses to obtain an inner perception of earth. For full explanations, see Vism chaps. 4 and 5. Ce adds alokakasina, the light kasina, which is not in Be and Ee. 201 1:480—84 are five of the ten "foul" or unattractive objects .(asubharammana) discussed at Vism 178-79, Ppn 6.1-11. 202 For clarity's sake, I have slightly expanded the extremely com­ pressed Pali text. 203 Following this, Ee includes ten more suttas, obtained by taking saddhindriyam bhaveti (and the other four indriya) and saddhabalam bhaveti (and the other four bala) without associating them with a jhana or brahmavihara. This is not matched by Ce or Be and is thus likely to be an editorial error. 204 This number agrees with Be. Ee counts this as vagga XXI, Ce as the seventh subchapter of vagga XVI, but separately titled Kayagatasativaggo, "The Chapter on Mindfulness Directed to the Body." 205 In this sutta and those that follow, kayagatclsati should surely be understood in the broad sense of the Kayagatasati Sutta (MN

 rather than in the narrow sense of Vism 240, Ppn 8.44, which restricts it to contemplation of the thirty-two bodily parts. Mp: "Wholesome qualities that pertain to true knowledge (kusala dhamma ye keci vijjabhagiya): There are eight kinds of true knowl­ edge: insight knowledge, the mind-made body, and the six kinds of direct knowledge (see, e.g., 3:101,6 :2 ). The qualities associated with these eight are the things that pertain to true knowledge. Or, if one of the eight is taken to be true knowledge, the others are 'qualities that pertain to true knowledge.'" At 2:31, samatha and vipassana are said to be the two things that pertain to true knowledge. 206 See above, note 187. - 207 Ce and Ee count four separate suttas here, each based on one of the benefits that come from developing mindfulness of the body, whereas Be combines them into one. The use of the conjunction pi after each item seems to corroborate Be, which I follow. 208 . Ee counts, two suttas here, one based on the non-arising of unarisen unwholesome qualities, the other on the abandoning of arisen unwholesome qualities. Ce and Be, which I follow, take this to be one sutta. 209 Again, Ee counts this as two suttas, but I follow Ce and Be in taking it as one. 210 Here I follow Ce and Ee in taking this passage as five suttas, whereas Be treats it as one.

(2 ).The polished-shell shave (sankhamundika): they cut the skin [in the area] bounded by his upper lip, the roots of the ears, and gullet, bind all his head hairs into a knot, tie them around a stick, and pull it up, so that his skin together with his head hairs comes off; then they rub his skull with coarse sand and wash it, until it becomes the color of a conch shell. (3) Rahu's mouth (rahumukha): they force open his mouth with a spike and bum a lamp insidie his mouth, or they dig into his mouth with a spade until the blood flows and fills

Mp specifies three types of "acquisitions" (upadhi): the five aggregates, the defilements, and volitional activities (khandha, kilesa, abhisankhara). The relinquishment of these is a synonym for nibbana. The striving for this is the energy arisen along with insight and the path. 220 The two things that cause torment (dhamma tapanlya) are not expressly stated as such in the text, but it is clear that they are (1) engaging in misconduct, and (2 ) failing to engage in good

Moral shame is directed inwardly. It arises from self-respect and induces one to reject wrongdoing based on the sense of one's own inherent dignity. Moral dread has an outward direction. It arises from fear of blame and. induces one to reject wrongdoing based on fear of the consequences. For more details, see CMA

Thus they include all the noble persons except the arahant who is asekha, "one beyond training." 230 Sahkhittena ca vittharena ca. Mp: "A brief teaching is one expounded briefly by reciting the outline (matika). A detailed teaching is one expounded by elaborating and analyzing the outline (;matikam vittharato vibhajitvd kathita). But whether or not an outline is set up, a teaching spoken with elaboration and analysis is called a detailed teaching. The brief teaching is spo­ ken for a person with great w isdom /a detailed teaching for a person whose intellect is blunter.. .. . Though the entire Tipitaka is a brief teaching, it is here considered a detailed teaching." 231 Mp mentions the four kinds of disciplinary issues: involving a dispute (vivad.ad.hika.rana), involving an accusation (anuvadadhi- karana), involving an offense (apattadhikamna), and involving procedure (kiccadhikarana). These aire dealt with in detail at Vin II88-92. Briefly, an issue involving a dispute arises when monks or nuns dispute about the Dhamma and the Vinaya; an issue involving an accusation arises when they accuse another mem­ ber of committing a transgression; an issue involving an offense arises when a monk or nun who has committed a transgression seeks rehabilitation; and an issue involving procedure deals with the collective procedures of the Sahgha. Methods for set­ tling disciplinary issues (adhikaranasamatha) are explained at MN 104.12-20, II 247-50. See too Thanissaro 2007a: 546-61. 232 Aham kho akusalam apanno kancideva desam kayena. Mp: "Here, by 'what is unwholesome' {akusalam), an offense {apatti) is intended; the meaning is 'I have committed an offense.' 'A particular mis­ deed' (kancideva desam): not every offense, but a particular kind of offense; the meaning is 'a certain offense.'" 233 Sunkadayakam va bhandasmim. 1 have elaborated slightly on the terse Pali expression to bring out the sense. Mp: "A crime is incurred by one importing taxable goods when he avoids the taxation station, and he is the criminal in this case, not the kings or their employees." 234 Mp explains that the two faults on the part of the reproving monk are being overcome by displeasure and reproving the other because of his displeasure. The three faults on the part of the monk being reproved are committing the offense, being displeased, and informing others. 235 Conduct contrary to the Dhamma (adhammacariya) and conduct in accordance with the Dhamma (dhammacariyd) are explained

###### respectively identified with the ten courses of unwholesome kamma and the ten courses of wholesome kamma. 236 Mp explains that the brahmin had approached the Buddha out of pride, intending to find fault with the teaching. The Buddha
 ■knew this and understood that the brahmin would benefit only if he were prompted by an ambiguous reply to inquire further. Since the Buddha first stated the cause of rebirth in heaven in the same terms as he stated the cause of rebirth in hell, the brah­ min had to admit his perplexity and ask for clarification. This humbled him, opening his mind to understanding. 237 Be divides this sutta into two, whereas Ce and Ee, which I follow, treat the passages on the disappearance and the continuation of the Dhamma as contrasting parts of a single sutta. .238 Dunnikkhittanca padabyahjanam attho ca dunnito. 239 Sunikkhittanca padabyanjanam attho ca sunito. 240 Also at SN 11:24,1 2 3 9 ,26-31, where it is embedded in a story and embellished with a verse. 241 Mp: "The former is exemplified by Sunakkhatta, who said: The ascetic Gotama does not have any superhuman qualities' (at MN 12.2, I 6 8 ,9-10). The latter is exemplified by a devotee whose faith is destitute of understanding, such as one who mis­ represents the Tathagata by claiming: 'The Buddha is entirely world-transcending (buddho nama sabbalokuttaro); all the parts of his body, such as the head hairs, are world-transcending/" This latter comment seems to be a dig at the Lokottaravadins, a sub­ sect of the Mahasamghikas that held the Buddhas to be entirely world-transcendent. 242 Ee divides this into two separate suttas by way of the two para­ graphs, whereas Ce and Be take it as one. 243 The question of which discourses of the Buddha are of explicit meaning (mtattha) and which require interpretation (neyyattha) became one of the most intensely debated issues in Buddhist hermeneutics. Starting with the early Indian Buddhist schools, the debate continued in such later Mahayana sutras as the Aksayamatinirdesa and the SamcLhinirmocana. The controversy continued even beyond India, in Sri Lanka, China, and Tibet. The Pali commentaries decide this issue on the basis of the Abhi­ dhamma distinction between ultimate realities and conventional realities. Mp: "Those suttas that speak of one; person (puggala), two persons, etc., require interpretation, for their meaning has to be interpreted in the light of the fact that in the ultimate sense a person does not exist (paramatthato pana puggalo nama natthi). One

###### Notes to the Twos 1625

 that the person exists in the ultimate sense, explains a discourse whose meaning requires interpretation as one whose meaning is explicit. A sutta whose meaning is explicit is one that explains impermanence, suffering, and non-self; for in this case the mean­ ing is simply impermanence, suffering, and non-self. One who says, 'This discourse requires interpretation/ and interprets it in such a way as to affirm that 'there is the permanent, there is the pleasurable, there is a self/ explains a sutta of explicit meaning as one requiring interpretation." The first criticism here is prob­ ably directed against the Puggalavadins, who held the person to be. ultimately existent; The latter might have been directed against an early form, of the tathagatagdrbha theory, which (in the Mahayana Parinirvana Sutra) affirmed a permanent, blissful, pure self. ... 244 Mp interprets "concealed action" (paticchannakamma) simply as a bad deed, explaining that even if a bad deed is not concealed, it is still called a concealed action. However> it .seems that confess­ ing one's bad deed and making amends for it would mitigate its negative force. See Dhp 173: /'One who has committed a bad deed but covers it up with good illumines this world like the moon freed from a cloud." 245 Ee combines this sutta and the next two into one, whereas Ce and Be keep them separate. I suspect that Ee rightly joins 2:27 and 2:28, two complementary discourses, but errs in including 2:29, which has a different theme. Still, I defer to Ce and Be. Note that 2:26 find 2:29 join into one sutta two contrasting statements about the two types of rebirth respectively resulting from bad and good conduct. 246 Patiggaha. An unusual use of this word. Mp says simply that these two states receive (patigganhanti) the immoral person. 247 Artmnavanapattham pantani senasanani. I follow Mp, which explains aranftavanapattham as a dvanda compound: arannani ca vanapatthani ca. 248 Pacchimanca janatam anukamparnano. Ps 1 129,4- 12, commenting on the same expression at MN I 23,35, says: "How does he show compassion for later generations by dwelling in the forest? When young men who have gone forth out of faith see that even the Blessed One—who had nothing more to understand, abandon, develop, and realize—did not neglect dwelling in the forest, they will think that they, too, should dwell in the forest. Thus they will quickly make an end of suffering." 249 Vijjabhagiya. See 1:575. 250 For more on the relationship of serenity (samatha) and insight

 251 Mp interprets the mind being developed as the "mind of the path" (maggacitta) and the wisdom being developed as the "wis­ dom of the path" (maggapanna). However, it seems to me that the text itself intends "mind" and "wisdom" generically, not specifically as the mind and wisdom of the noble path attain­ ment. The development of the mind through samatha and of wisdom through vipassana, however, culminate in the "taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom" (anasava cetovimutti pailhavimutti), the final goal of the.Dhamma. Here, samatha is the condition for liberation of mind and vipassana for liberation by wisdom. 252 I read with Ce and Ee katanca hoti patikatanca atikatahca ti. Be ends at patikatanca ti. 253 The operative terms here are kiriyavada and akiriyav&da. For the Buddhist critique of akiriyavada, a doctrine that denied the valid­ ity of ethical distinctions, see MN 60.13,.I 404,21-35; MN 76.10, I 516,3-17. The present sutta seems to be extracted from 8:i2 §§ 1- 2. 254 Mp: "The 'trainee' (sekha) refers to the seven trainees [from the one on the path of stream-entry to the one on the path of arahant­ ship]. But the virtuous worldling (silavantaputhujjana) can also be included under the stream-enterer." 255 .Mp has a long preamble to its commentary on this sutta, explain­ ing how throngs of lay devotees from SavatthI spontaneously assembled at the Eastern Park to hear Sariputta speak. The devas, too, realizing that Sariputta was about to deliver a momentous discourse, arrived from multiple celestial realms and from thou­ sands of world systems to listen. Sariputta exercised a feat of psychic power such that even those at the back of .the crowd, and the devas at the far edge of the world system, could clearly see him and hear Inis voice. 256 Mp: "The person fettered internally (ajjhattasamyojanain puggalam): The 'internal' (ajjhattam) is sense-sphere existence; the 'external' (bahiddha) is form and formless existence. Desire and lust for 'the internal/ consisting in sense-sphere existence, is called the inter' nal fetter. Desire and lust for 'the external/ consisting in form and formless existence, is called the external fetter. Or, alterna­ tively, the five lower fetters are the internal fetter, and the five higher fetters are the external fetter. The persons being spoken of as internally fettered and externally fettered are not the mul­ titude of ordinary worldly people still attached to the round of existence, but noble disciples—stream-enterers, once-retumers, and non-returners—who are distinguished as twofold by way.

###### Motes to the Tzvos 1627

 It is striking that the Chinese parallel MA 21 (at T I 448C23-25) interprets these two persons in a way diametrically opposite to the Pali version: "In this world there are two kinds of people. Which two? The person with an internal fetter, the non-returner, who does not come back to this world. And the person with an external fetter, one who is not a non-returner but comes back to this world'' ® A ° ° » 'FiSlttPs] ” ’ ° MJfSihhPal). The explanations that follow in MA

Or else, he is.not reborn in that heavenly realm or in some higher realm, but he comes back to a lower realm. By this factor, what is discussed are the lower two paths and fruits [of stream-entry and once- returning] attained by a bhikkhu who is a dry-insight medita­ tor using the elements as meditation subject (sukkhavipassakassa.
 ■ dhatukammatthanikabhikkhuno)/'. ' 258. Mp: "A certain peaceful liberation o f mind (annataranr santam cetovimuttim): the fourth jhana among the eight meditative attainments; for that is peaceful because it stills the opposing defilements, and it is a liberation of mind because it is liberated from those defilements." 259 Mp: "He is reborn in an order of devas among the pure abodes (suddhdvasa). He does not return to this state of the human five aggregates, nor is he reborn in a lower realm. Either he is reboot in a higher realm or he attains final nibbana right there. By this factor, what is discussed are the three paths and fruits
 [up to non-returning] of a bhikkhu working at concentration (samadhikammikassa bhikkhuno)." 260 Mp: "At this point, what is discussed is the stream-enterer's and once-returner's insight [undertaken] to destroy lust for the five objects of sensual pleasure and [to reach] the path of non­ returning (andgamimaggavipassana)." 261 Mp: "By this, what is discussed is the non-returner's insight
 [undertaken] to destroy lust for existence and [to reach] the path of arahantship (arahattamaggavipassana)." 262 Mp sees the practice for the destruction of craving (tanhdkkhaya) as again referring to the stream-enterer's and once-returner's insight to reach the path of non-returning, and the practice for the destruction of greed (lobhakkhaya) as again referring to the non-returner's insight to reach the path of arahantship. It would be peculiar for such a distinction to be intended here. Since both craving (tanhd) and greed (lobha) can refer to the

###### 1628 The Anguttara Nikaya

 it seems improbable that, after alluding to the highest realization, Sariputta would then revert to a lower level, this sentence may simply be continuing the description of one practicing to attain arahantship. 263 Mp: "[Sariputta] has discussed insight under six headings: (1) the lower two paths and fruits of the dry-insight meditator who uses the elements as his meditation subject; (2 ) the three paths and fruits of one who works at concentration; (3) the stream-enterer's and once-retumer's insight to destroy sensual lust [and reach] the path of non-returning; (4) the non-returner's insight to destroy lust for existence [and reach] the path of arahantship; (5) the stream-enterer's and once-retumer's insight for 'the destruction of craving'— that is, craving for sensual pleasure—and to reach the path of non-returning; and (6 ) the nonrreturner's insight for 'the destruction of greed':—that is, greed for existence— and
 [to reach] the path of arahantship. At the conclusion of the dis­ course, deities numbering hundreds of thousand of kotis (a koti - ten million) attained arahantship, arid there was no.counting the number of those who became streanventerers and so forth/' 264 Mp explains samacitta to mean "with the same mind," thereby resolving an ambiguity in the Pali term. Though in Skt the difference between' sama -= "peace" and sama = "same, equal" would have been clear, in most dialects of Middle Indo-Aryan (including Pali) the two words would be indistinguishable and thus their meanings could be conflated. Mp construes sama as equivalent to. Skt sama, "same, equal": "They are called 'same- minded' because of the similarity in the subtlety of their mind (cittassa sukhumabhavasamataya samacitta)-, for they had created their own bodies with minds of similar subtlety (sukhume citta- sarikkhake katva)." Mp gives other explanations of samacitta, but all assume the meaning is. "with the same mind." The Chinese parallel (at T1449bi) reads = "same-minded deities," thus agreeing with Mp. This indicates that the original on which the Chinese translation was based either had samacitta in a language that made a distinction between pama and sama, or, if preserved in a language that did not make such a distinction, had been accompanied by an explanation of the term as meaning "same- minded." However, the expressions santindriyti and santamanasa toward the end of the sutta, both related to the Skt sama, suggest that the original meaning could have been "peaceful minded," unless ambivalence was deliberate. 265 Anukampam upadaya.

 of a disciple's knowledge. Rather, they ask the Blessed One to go out of compassion for the other devas and humans who had assembled there." Despite the commentary, it may be the case that the devas actually wanted the Buddha to approach Sariputta for his own sake. Sariputta probably did not have the supernor­ mal ability to see the hosts of devas that had assembled to hear him speak and thus the Buddha had to inform him of this. At Ud 40,28-29, Sariputta says that he does not even see a mud sprite {mayam pan'etarahi pamsupisaqakampi na passama). 266. Mp: "It ivas right here (idh'eva): It was in this human world and under this teaching that those deities had developed their minds in such a way that they were reborn in a peaceful.form-sphere existence. Having come from there, they have created subtle bodies. While those deities might have reached three paths and fruits in Buddha Kassapa's teaching, because all Buddhas have the same teaching, with the words 'right here' he refers to the teaching as one." The Chinese parallel is more explicit than the Pali: "It was in the past when they were human beings that those same-minded deities developed such a wholesome mind, such an extremely vast and great mind." 267 Santindriya bhavissdma santamanasa. As noted in note 264 above, the repeated use of the word santa here and just below suggests that samacitta, in relation to the deities, could have meant "peace- ful minded"— this despite the agreement between Mp and the Chinese translation on "same-minded." 268 Kamaragabhinivesavinibandhapaligedhapariyutthanajjhosanahetu. I render the compound following Mp's resolution: kamaraga- bhinivesahetu, kamaragairinibandhahetu, kamaragapaligedhahetu, kamaragapariyutthanahetu, kamaraga-ajjhossnahetu. The same applies to the long compound on ditthi. 269 The same charge is leveled against the Buddha himself in 4:22 and 8 :1 1 . 270 I follow Ce and Be kamamajjhavasati (= kamam ajjhavasati), as against Ee kamamajjhe vasati. 271 Tunhtbhuta tunhlbhuta va sanghamajjhe sankasayanti.

That values the good Dhamma (saddhammagaru): one that values the nine world-transcending dhammas (the four paths, four fruits, and nibbana), and regards the four requisites as inferior/' 287 The first seven are disciples who have reached the world- transcending paths and fruits. For formal explanations, see MN. . ; 70.14—2 1 ,1 477-79. The latter two are respectively the good per­ son and the bad person who have not reached the path. 288 Be lacks the two sentences beginning respectively, "It is because it is unrighteous" and (below) "It is because it is righteous."

###### is precisely the opposite of what the context requires. Older Sinhala-script editions, referred to in the notes to Ce, read ajjhattam na suvupasantam hoti, "not well settled internally," which makes better sense. Be and Ee read ajjhattam avupasantam hoti, supported by the lemma of Mp (Ce and Be). I thus translate on the basis of this reading. Similarly, in the following para­ graph, Ce reads ajjhattam avupasantam hoti, again the opposite of what the context requires. I take as the basis for my rendering there Be and Ee ajjhattam rm suvupasantam hoti. ■ 299. Ce treats this paragraph as a separate sutta. Be and Ee, which I follow, treat the two paragraphs as a single sutta. Unless the two paragraphs are taken in this way, there is no dyad here justifying their inclusion in the Twos. 300 I read with Be pabbajitasukham, as against Ce and Ee pahbajja- sukham, The contrast between gihi and pabbajita seems more logi­ cal than that between gihi and pabbajja. 301 Upadhisukha and nirupadhisukha. On upadhi, see p. 1621, note 219. Mp glosses the former as the happiness of the three planes (sense-sphere, form, and formless planes). It glosses the latter as world-transcending happiness (lokuttarasukha). 302 The contrast is between samisam sukham, which Mp defines as defiled happiness that leads back to the round [of existence], and niramisam sukham, undefiled happiness that leads to the end of the round. 303 Mp: "The happiness with rapture (sappitikam sukham) is the hap­ piness of the first and second jhanas. The happiness without rap­ ture (nippitikam sukharn) is the happiness of the third and fourth jhanas." 304 Mp.

It is doubtful that, in the four Nikayas, the word arammana ever means "object of consciousness" in the general sense it has in the Abhidhamma and the commentaries. Its original meaning is closer to "basis" or "suppbrt." Occasionally, as in SN 34:5, III 266, the word designates a "meditation object." Over time, . the meaning of arammana must have broadened from "object of meditation" to "object of consciousness" in a general sense, but to my knowledge this development occurred after the period when the Nikayas were compiled. 306 Mp: "The happiness based on form (riiparamfttanam sukham) is that based on the fourth jhana of the form sphere, or any that

For the words 'source/ 'cause/ 'causal activity,' 'condition/ and 'form' are all just synonyms for 'reason'" (Sanim itta ti sakarana Nidanam hetu sankharo paccayo rupan ti sabbani pi hi etani karanavevacanan'eva). 308 I follow the arrangement in Be and Ee. Ce does not place this sutta here, but because the key word is sasankharfc, inserts it below, as the fourth among the suttas on the five aggregates. It seems that the text availablie to the commentator corresponded with Be, for. Mp (both-Ce and Be) explains that nimitta, nidana, hetu, sankharaj, arid paccaya are synonymous. 309 Mp: "Liberation of mind (cetovimutti). is the concentration of the fruit [of arahantship], liberation by wisdom (pannavimutti) is the wisdom of the fruit." This interpretation assumes that the two are conjoined, as in the expression anasavam cetovimuttim panfiavimuttini. It is possible, however,Tor mundane cetovimutti to be attained independently of pannavimutti. For a discussion of the contrast between mundane and world-transcending types of cetovimutti, see MN 43.30-37,1 297—98, and SN 41.7, IV 295-97. 310 Be has these inverted. 311 Yoca akappiye kappiyasanm, yo ca kappiye akappiyasannl. This refers to what is allowable and not allowable according to the rules of monastic discipline. 312 I translate based on Ce and Ee. Be inverts the two clauses, read­ ing: Yo ca apattiya anapattisanni, yo*ca anapattiya apattisanm. 313 Here, too, Be inverts the clauses, reading: Yo ca apattiya apattisanm, yo ca anapattiya anapattisanni. 314 Here, again, I follow Ce and Ee over Be, which inverts the clauses. 315 Mp glosses asa here with tanha. 316 Yo ca laddham laddham vissajjeti. Mp glosses: "He gives to others" (paresam deti). However, I think what is indicated by vissajjeti is not generosity but profligacy. 317 In relation to this and the following sutta, see 1:11,1:12. 318 For explanations of these types of offenses, here and just below, see p. 1602, note 6 6 . 319 Esa bhikkhave tula etam pamanam.

The latter's name is also spelled Velukantakiya and Velukandakl. 323 Ce divides each statement about the fool and the wise person in 2:134r-37 into two suttas, whereas Be and Ee treat them as contrasting parts of a single sutta. Thus where Be and Ee count four suttas here, Ce counts eight. Parallels in later nipatas (3:9, 4:3,10:225-28) even in Ce support Be and Ee, which I therefore follow. - ' ' 324 Ce mistakenly numbers the first paragraph of this sutta as 6 within the vagga, thus assigning 6 to two successive suttas- This should be corrected to 7, and the following sutta numbers in the vagga should all be increased by one. 325 Mp mentions Devadatta in relation to the Tathagata and Kokalika in relation to the chief disciples (see 10:89; alsoSN 6:9-10,1 149^ .53; Sn 3:10, pp. 123—31; Vin II196-200). On the positive side, Mp mentions respectively Ananda, and the cowherd Nanda and the financier's son. 326 Sacittavodananca na ca kind loke upadiyati.

This is the word normally signifying active compas­ sion or empathy, as contrasted with karuna, which usually signi­ fies meditative compassion. 329 Santhara. Mp explains this as if it meant "a covering" or "a spread," which it does in certain contexts: "The covering with material goods is spreading out by covering [the space] between oneself and others with the four requisites." More likely, how­ ever, santh&ra here is nearly synonymous with patisanthara, which occurs in the next sutta. In fact, Mp says that the differ­ ence between the two words is a mere prefix. 330 Atitheyyani. Mp glosses with agantukadan&ni, "gifts to a guest." 331 Mp: "Skillfulness in [entering] almeditative attainment (sam- apattikusalata) is facility in entering the attainment after one has understood suitability in food and climate. Skillfulness in emerg­ ing from a meditative attainment (samapattivutthanakusalata) is skill in emerging at the predetermined time." 332. I here follow Ce and Ee, which count each of the five pairs as a separate sutta; Be counts each group as one sutta. 333 Be and Ce count the following suttas as a separate vagga, but Ee

Be also treats it as an independent vagga, but Ce takes it as the second subchapter of its vagga XVII. 336 Ce counts ten separate suttas here, but I follow Be and Ee in tak­ ing them as one. 337 What follows here are all disciplinar}' regulations laid down in the Vinaya Pitaka. 338 Ee treats this as a continuation of vagga XVII, Ce and Be as an independent vagga but without a number.

 339 Readings differ among the editions. Ce apadanasobhini pafina, Be apadanasobhanl pafina, Ee apadane sobhati panna. Mp: "The mean­ ing is that the fool and the wise person are each known through their conduct" (bala ca pandita ca attano attano cariten'eva pakata konti ti atthc). 340 Balalakkhanani balanimitlani balapadanani, Mp: "These are the . means of recognition." 341 Ee omits this concluding exhortation in 3:3-7. 342 Mp. " Discordant (ananulomike) means not in conformity with the teaching. Gross 'discordant bodily action' is destroying life/ etc.; or [more subtly] worshipping the directions or making offerings to the spirits. Gross 'discordant verbal action' is false speech, etc.; or [more subtly], if one does not wish to give to others, deceiving them by saying one does not have anything to give. Gross 'discordant mental action' is longing, etc.; or [more subtly], explaining a meditation subject incorrectly." Mp illustrates this with the story of the elder mentioned at Vism 296,12-16, Ppn 9.6, who taught a young man to meditate on loving-kindness toward his wife. As a result he was overcome by lust and beat against the walls of his meditation cell all night. I translate ananulomikesu dhammesu in accordance with Mp, but the word dhammesu can also mean "teachings," and it is possible that this was the original intention. 343 The second case, the understanding of the four noble truths, marks the attainment of stream-entry; the third, the destruction of the taints, is the attainment of arahantship. 344 These were all considered low occupations fit only for social outcasts.

 345 Ce reads macalappatto; Ee - macalapatto; Be acalappatto. In 4:87 §1 we find samanamacaloon which see p. 1694, note 778. Here Mp explains: "When the eldest— one due to be anointed but not yet anointed—is still an infant, he does not form any wish to be anointed. But when he reaches the age of sixteen and his beard begins to grow, he is called 'one who has attained the unshaken/ He is able to reign over a large realm, therefore [the Buddha] says 'one who has attained the unshaken/" 346 Mp glosses dhamma here as "the Dhamma of the ten courses of wholesome kamma" (dasakusalakammapathadhammo). This is certainly too narrow, but it is clear that " Dhamma" here does not mean the Buddha's teaching as such. Rather, it is the universal principle of goodness and truth followed by virtuous people irrespective of their religious convictions. On the basis of this Dhamma the wheel-turning monarch provides righteous (dham­ mika) protection to all in his realm. 347 Mp: "He sets in motion the wheel just by means of the Dhamma of the ten courses of wholesome kamma." Ce and Be read the verb here as vatteti, but below, in relation to the Buddha, as pavatteti', Ee has pavatteti in relation to both. If vatteti is the original reading, the change in verbs may be intended to suggest that a wheel- turning monarch does not initiate the rule of righteousness but continues the heritage of his forefathers, whereas a Buddha sets in motion the wheel of Dhamma previously unknown. 348 Kenaci manussabhutena paccatthikena panina. Lit. "by any hostile living being that has become human." Mp: "The deities, it is said, can do whatever they want. Therefore they are not included, but 'human being' is mentioned." This is in contrast with the Bud­ dha, whose wheel cannot be turned back by any beings including the deities. 349 So Ce and Ee. Be gives the king's name as Sacetana. 350 Abhisafikharassa gati. An unusual use of the word abhisahkhara, which in more technical contexts denotes volitional activity that creates kamma. Mp glosses with payogassa gamanam, "the move­ ment of (or due to) the effort." , 351 Mp: "As if fixed on an axle: as if an axle had been inserted so that it stood still/' 352 Apannakapatipadam. Mp gives a series of synonyms: "the unmistaken way, the definite way, the emancipating way, the causal way, the essential way, the exquisite way, the unopposed way> the conducive way, the way in accord with the Dhamma" (aviraddhapatipadam ekamsapatipadam niyyanikapatipadam karana- patipadam sarapatipadam mandapatipadam apaccamkapatipadam

 a similar sense, is found in AN at 4:71, 4:72, and 10:46. It also occurs as the title of MN 60. In relation to yoni c'assa araddha hoti asavanam khayaya, Mp explains that yoni can mean a section of the aggregates, a cause, or the vagina (khandhakotthasa, karana, passavamagga). Here, a cause is intended. 353 At SN 35:239, IV 175,26-30, too, it is said that by these three prac­ tices "one has laid the groundwork for the destruction of the taints/' 354 Matikadhara. Mp glosses this as "experts on the two outlines" (dvematikadhara), which M p / identifies as the bhikkhu and bhikkhuni matikas (the Patimokkhas for monks and nuns) or . the matikas of the Vinaya and Abhidhamma. The matikas were lists of principles and practices that systematically represent the Dhamma. The matikadhara are mentioned once in DN, twice in MN (in one sutta), not at all in SN, and twelve times in AN, which suggests that the suttas that refer to them are relatively late, or at least had been modified to accommodate them. On their nature and role, see Warder 1980: 218—24. 355 For formal explanations of these three types, see MN 70.17-19,1 478,4—479,3. All three classes are sekhas ranging from the stream- enterer through one on the path to arahantship. As general classes, they differ, not in their position relative to the final goal, but in their dominant spiritual faculty. The body witness (kayasakkhi) gives prominence to concentration and attains the "peaceful formless emancipations." One attained to view (ditthippatta) gives prominence to wisdom and does not attain the formless emancipations. One liberated by faith (saddhavimutta) gives prominence to faith and does not attain the formless emancipa­ tions. Because these three categories comprise persons standing anywhere from stream-enterer to the path to arahantship, their members cannot be prejudged as superior and inferior merely by falling into a particular class. To make such judgments, one would have to know their standing in terms of the six levels they each comprise. The body witness, on attaining arahantship, becomes "liberated in both respects" (ubhatobhagavimutta). The other two become "liberated by wisdom" (pannavimutta). On the two types of arahant, see MN 70.15—1 6 ,1 477,24-478,3. 356 In the Pali, each participant in the discussion repeats the open­ ing statement about the three persons before expressing his own opinion. To avoid redundancy, I have deleted this repetition. 357 Ce has, for this case only, "a person attained to view is an ara­ hant or one practicing for arahantship" (svassa araha va arahattaya patipanno). Be and Ee, consistent with the previous two types,

 According to the typology of MN 70, a body witness, one lib­ erated by faith, and one attained to view have not completely eliminated their asavas and therefore are not arahants. 358 Okkamati niyamam kusalesu dhammesu sammatiarrj.. This is a techni­ cal expression denoting entry upon the world-transcending path. Mp: "The fixed course [consisting in] rightness in wholesome quali­ ties: rightness in wholesome qualities consisting in entry upon the path." Though "rightness in wholesome qualities" sounds redundant, what is intended is the harmony and strength of the wholesome qualities needed to enter the path of stream-entry. For more on this expression in AN, see 5:151—53 and 6:86-88. See too SN 25.1-10, III 225-28, Which says that by entering the "fixed course of rightness" (sammattaniydma) one enters the noble plane and becomes either a dhammdnusdri or a saddhanusari. 359' Sabydbajjham kayasafikharam abhisahkh'aroti, sabydbajjham vaclsan- khdram abhi$ahkharoti, sabydbajjham manos.ankhdram abhisankharoti. Mp glosses sabydbajjham, "afflictive,". with sadukkham, "with suffering/' The "activities" are volitional actions that create kamma. 360 Deva subhakinha. These are the deities in the divine realm cor­ responding to the third jhana. See 4:123. 361 Mp: "Those in the lower world referred to here are the afflicted spirits with palaces (vemdnikapetd). For at times they experience fortune, at times they experience their [painful] kamma; they undergo mixed pleasure and pain." 362 By understanding the four noble truths, the attainment of stream- entry is indicated. The destruction of the taints, just below, marks the attainment of arahantship. 363 Tattha tattka pannaya anuggahessdmi. Mp: "One assists with wisdom the aggregate of virtuous behavior in one or another respect by avoiding those things that are uncongenial and unhelpful to vir­ tuous behavior and by cultivating those things that are congenial and helpful [to it]. The same method holds for the aggregates of concentration and wisdom." "Aggregate of virtuous behavior" (sllakkhandha) is spoken of in the sense of the assemblage of. fac­ tors that constitute virtuous behavior, and so too tor the aggre­ gates of concentration and wisdom. 364 This is the standard definition of false speech among the ten courses of unwholesome kamma, as at 10:176 §4 of the unwhole­ some section. The explanation of "speech like flowers," just ' below, is the standard definition of truthful speech in the cor­ responding wholesome section. 365 Reading here dhanam with Ce and B.

 366 Mp explains the compound ahankaranmmahkaramananusaya as "I-making by views, mine-making by craving, and the underly­ ing tendency to conceit. These are the defilements in relation to oneself and others." Mp explains bahiddha ca sabbanimittesu ("and all external objects") as the five sense objects, the eternalist (and other) views, the person, and Dhamma. It calls this samadhi the fruition attainment of arahantship (arahattaphalasamdpatti). 367 Sn 1048. The Parayana, the fifth and final chapter of the Sutta- nipata, consists of a framing story and sixteen sections in each of which the Buddha answers the questions of the students of the elder brahmin Bavari. Verses from the Pariyana are cited, and explained elsewhere in AN and other Nikayas, which testifies to its antiquity. It must have existed as an independent work before being incorporated into Sn. The Parayana is the subject of an ancient canonical commentary, the Culaniddesa, included in the Khuddaka Nikaya. 368 Ee takes this sutta to belong to the preceding one and thus assigns only one number to them. In Ce and Be, which I follow, it is separate. Thus from this point on my. numbering exceeds Ee by one. 369 Sn 1106-7. 370 This is an allusion to the abandoning of the five hindrances, of which four are mentioned here. 371 Mp takes this to be the fruit of arahantship based on the fourth jhana, which is suggested by the line upekkhasatisamsuddham, echoing the stock formula for the fourth jhana. 372 There are some differences in the readings: Ce ditthe va dhamme,
 ■upapajje va, apare va pariyaye; Be ditthe va dhamme upapajja va apare va pariyaye; Ee ditth' eva dhamme upapajje va apare va pariyaye. Mp says: "This is stated to show that the kamma is [of the type] either to be experienced in this present life, or to be experienced follow­ ing rebirth, or to be experienced in some subsequent existence." For an Abhidhamma explanation of this triad, see CMA 205. Some scholars have argued from the variant readings that only two alternatives are involved: either in this life or upon rebirth. However, I translate in accordance with the commen- tarial understanding. While the commentaries may be impos­ ing a later interpretation on more archaic texts that asserted oniy two ways in which kamma can ripen, as a translator I feel responsible to the text that has been transmitted rather than to theories about a more archaic original. The recognition of a threefold ripening of kamma is not exclusive to the Theravada school but is also found in the treatises of the Sarvastivada Abhi-

 the Abhidharma Mahavibhasa Sastra at T XXVII 592a22—593b8, and in the Abhidharmakosa at T XXIX 81cio-i6— are exactly the same as in the Pali tradition and thus likely precede the divisioii of the schools. 373 This statement has to be carefully interpreted. For an arahant— who has abandoned greed, hatred, and delusion— kamma cre­ ated earlier, whether good or bad, is still capable of ripening during the final life. But because there is no more rebirth, with his passing all accumulated kamma from the past becomes defunct. Thus the intention of this statement is not that an arahant's past kamma cannot ripen while the arahant lives, but that it becomes defunct with the afahant's passing; for there will be no further continuum of existence within which its fruits might arise. Brahmali writes: "There must be a distinction here between 'non-greed' (alobha) and the situation when 'greed has vanished' (lobhe vigata). The former must refer to the motivation behind a particular action, the latter to the full uprooting of greed, attained only by the non-returner or even the arahant. Only in the light of this distinction does this statement make sense." 374 I read .with. Ce and Be mohajan capaviddasu-, as against Ee's mohajan capi 'viddasu. Mp (both Ce and Be) also reads mohajan capaviddasu, which it resolves into mohajancapi aviddasu. It paraphrases the meaning thus: "Whatever kamma the blind, ignorant worldling creates born of greed, hatred, and delusion—whether the kamma so fashioned be little or much— it is to be experienced right here (idh'eva tam vedaniyam), that is, it is to be experienced by the fool here in his very own being (idha sake attabhaveyeva); this means that it ripens in his own individual beings There exists no other site [for it] (vatthum annam na vijjati): there is no other site for the ripening of that kamma; for the kamma done by one person does not ripen in another's being." 375 Tasma lobharn ca dosam ca, mohajam capi viddasu. Ee reads. Lhe last pada mohan capi 'viddasu, which is missing a syllable. The text does lack a verb and direct object qualifed by mohajam. Mp supplies these in its paraphrase: "Therefore a wise person does not do that kamma born of greed and so forth" {yo iridu . . . tam lobhajadibhedam kammam na karoti). It will be noted that Mp con­ siders lobham and dosam to be truncated forms of lobhajam and dosajam, and I translate accordingly. For the verb, I see jahe of pada d to implicitly extend up into padas a and b, thus doing a dual service. 376 See 1:251.

 378 Similar verses are spoken to Anathapindika at SN 10:8,1 212. 379 A version of this sutta is at MN 130, but with four divine mes­ sengers, beginning with birth. 380 Mp: "The old person, the sick one, and the corpse are called 'divine messengers7 (devaduta) because they inspire a sense of urgency, as if warning one: 'Now you must go into the presence of death/" 381 The legendary god of death and the judge of one's future destiny. 382 Reading with Ce dukkha tibba khaluka vedana. Be and Ee add a fourth adjective, khara. 383 I read with Ee te khemappatta sukhita. Ce te khoppatta sukhita and Be te appamatta sukhino are both faulty. 384 The eighth of the fortnight is the day of the quarter moon, both waxing and waning. The "four great kings" (caturnaharajano) are the rulers of the lowest of the six sense-sphere heavenly worlds, the realm closest to the human. We find here a graded sequence:. on the eighth, their ministers and assembly members (amaccd; pdrisajja) inspect the world; on the fourteenth (the day before the full moon and new moon), their sons (putta)' inspect the world; and on the fifteenth, the actual full-moon and new-moon days, the four great kings themselves inspect the world. 385 Mp: ''When they observe the uposatha, they undertake the uposa­ tha factors eight times per month. Keeping the extra observance days (patij agar anti), in a single fortnight they do so by anticipat­ ing and following up (paccuggamananugamana) the four uposatha days. Anticipating the uposatha of the fifth, they undertake the uposatha on the fourth; and following up, on the sixth. Anticipat­ ing the uposatha of the eighth, they observe it on the seventh; and follo wing up, on the ninth. Anticipating the uposatha of the four­ teenth, they observe it on the thirteenth, and following up the uposatha of the fifteenth, they observe the uposatha at the begin­ ning [of the next fortnight]. They do meritorious deeds (puftnani karonti) in various ways: by going for refuge, constantly observ­ ing the precepts, offering flowers, listening to the Dhamma, offer­ ing lights, making dwellings, etc. Having wandered around, [the ministers and assembly members] write down the names of the merit-makers on a golden sheet and present it to the four great kings." For canonical accounts of the uposatha observance, see 3:70 and 8:41, 8:42. 386 I follow Be as against Ce and Ee in the division between this sutta and the next.

 takes the first narrative about Sakka to be a continuation of 3:37, and the second narrative to mark the beginning of 3:38. A Chi­ nese parallel, SA 1117 (TII 295cio-1296a23), agrees with Be on this but merges into one the two statements about Sakka and the liberated bhikkhu. 387 Patihdriyapakkha. Mp says that they undertake a continuous upo­ satha observance for the full three months of the rains (antovasse temasam); if they cannot manage this, they should observe it for a full month after the rains, between the two invitation days, or at least for a two-week period following the first invitation day. The "invitation" (pavarana) is the occasion, at the end of the rains, when bhikkhus and bhikkhunls "invite" (pavdreti) their fellows to point out any faults in their behavior during the rains. Spk I 307,9 16, commenting on patihdriyapakkha at SN 10:5, I 208,27, explains the term in a broader sense (see CDB p. 480, note 573). 3§8 Be treats this sentence as the beginning of 3:38. Strangely, Be titles this "The Second on the Four Great Kings" even though the sutta makes no mention of them. , 389 Mp defines paduma as a whitelotus (pandarapadumam) and pundarlka as a red lotus (rattapadumam). SED, however, defines pundarlka as "a lotus flower (esp. a white lotus)," adding that the word is used to mean "white" in general. Numerous websites I consulted also define pundarlka as a white lotus. 390 Kasi was one of the sixteen great states of India, with its capital at Baranasi. 391 These are the three seasons of. northern India: the winter lasts roughly from November to March, the hot season from March to July, and the rainy season from July to November. Mp says that the winter mansion had. nine stories, which were low in order to retain heat; the summer mansion had five stories, which were high in order to allow the air to cool; and the rains mansion had seven stories, which were neither high nor low in order to establish a medium temperature. 392 Nippurisehi.

 395 The third pada is obscure: yatha dhamma tatha santa. I translate it literally. In explaining the fourth pada, Mp adds parapuggalam as an object of the verb jigucchanti. 396 Ce and Be read nekkhamme datthu khematam. Ee has nekkhammam datthu khemato as its primary reading but mentions the Ce and Be variants in its notes. Mp (both Ce and Be) uses the Ce and Be reading as the lemma, which it glosses nibbane khemabhavam disva, but it then cites the Ee reading as a variant, glossed nibbanam khe­ mato disva. Thus here Ee has .chosen the variant as the primary reading. . 397 Mp says that these verses refer to his own energy as it arose while he was sitting beneath the bodhi tree. 398 In Pali: attadhipateyyam lokadhipateyyctm dhammadhipateyyam. Although Bucknell (2004) does not list a Chinese parallel of this sutta, by chance I recently discovered a parallel cited in the *Sariputrabhidharmasastra, at T XXVIII 679c22—680a27. While the prose portion there is simpler than that of the Pali, the two con­ vey essentially the same meaning. Their verses, with the excep­ tion of the last, also closely correspond. 399 Na itibhavabhavahetu. Mp takes the long vowel connecting the two occurrences of bhava to signify repetition, not negation: "Not for the sake of this or that prosperous future state of existence, [wish­ ing]: '[Let me obtain] such an existence [or] such an existence'" (iti bhavo, iti bhavo ti evam ayatim na tassa tassa sampattibhavassa hetu). 400 Atta te purisa janati saccam va yadi va musA. Mp: "You yourself know, of whatever you do, whether it is of this or that nature. For this reason, it should be understood that, for one who does an evil deed; there is no place in the world that can be called 'hidden.'". 401 The Pali is obscure here and Mp is not particularly helpful in resolving the difficulty. The Chinese parallel (at 680a2o-2i, but following the Song, Yuan, Ming reading) has: This conveys a somewhat different point, which I would render: "One who says 'It is not false' is better, for then one does not damage oneself. If a transgression exists and one knows it, do not conceal it." 402 The Chinese (at 680a26-27) is quite different: W, ti'&'FjM.M, I would render: "Having discarded and abandoned the six sense faculties, he ends suffering and does not take [another] existence. Having passed away, he does not come back, being forever freed from birth and death."

 (or commentary)" (atthakatham nanena patisamvedl) and "expe­ riences the Dhamma" (dhammapatisamvedi) as "experiences the Dhamma of the canonical text" (palidhammampatisamvedl). This obviously imposes a later distinction on older terms. However, while the two terms are often paired, the precise distinction between at tha and dhamma is not clearly drawn in the Nikayas. In fact, each term is ambivalent and thus their different nuances further complicate their relationship. Attha can signify meaning, benefit, good, and goal; dhamma can signify the teaching, the system of practice, the nature of things, ahd the truth pointed to by the teaching. Thus the contrast between dhamma and attha can be seen as that between the formulated teaching and its meaning, between the practice and its goal, and between the teaching and the benefit it brings. 404 Mp explains santanam brahmacarinam as referring to those who support their parents (idha pana matapitu-upatthaka adhippeta), but I see the expression as referring, to monastics, either as the recipients of service (upatthanam) or of the giving(danam) men­ tioned. in pada a. Mp further construes santanam as genitive plural of sant, "good, virtuous" (Mp: uttamatthena santanam), but it is more likely to be "peaceful," from Skt santa. Santanam brahmacarinam is also at SN 1:10, 1 5 , 4, where Spk I 2 8 .2, glosses it with santakilesanam panditanam va, "those with pacified defile­ ments or wise ones." The Chinese parallel SA 995 (at TII 2 6 0 c 2 9 ) has 'MMf&stlff, which means that in this transmission santanam came down as Skt sawfanflm. 405 Sahkhatassa sankhatalakkhanani. Lit. "three conditioned char­ acteristics of the conditioned." And below asahkhatassa asan- khatalakkhanani, lit. "three unconditioned characteristics of the unconditioned." I render these expressions in the way I have to avoid giving the wrong impression that the characteris­ tics themselves are conditioned or unconditioned. The point, rather, is that they determine as such the conditioned and the unconditioned. 406 I follow Ee in making the statements on the characteristics of the conditioned and the unconditioned two parts of a single sutta. Ce and Be take them to be separate suttas and thus count eleven suttas in this vagga. The uddana verse includes "sankhatam" but not "asankhatam which seems to support Ee. At this point, my numbering agrees with Ee but falls behind Be by one (Ce does not number the suttas continuously but begins each vagga with '1'). Interestingly, the Chinese parall el E A 22.5 (at TII 607ci3- C23) men­ tions only the characteristics of .the conditioned; there is no cor­

###### 407 Reading with Ce gedham (PED sv gedha2), as against Be and Ee rodham (bank). 408 At SN 1:3/ I 2/ this verse is spoken by a deity, who is then "cor­ rected" by the Buddha with a verse that bids the "seeker of peace" to "drop the world's bait" (lokamisam pajahe santipekkho). 409 This and the preceding verse are at SN 1:41,1 31. 410. Sanditthiko dhammo. 411 Kukkutasampatika. Mp: "'Cocks' flying between them' (kukkuta- sampdto) is cocks' flying from the rooftops in one village to the rooftops in another. When they are so situated, it is said they are 'so close that.cocks could fly between them.' There is also the reading kukkutasampadika ('so close that cocks could walk between them'). 'Cocks' walking between them' (kukkutasampddo) is cocks' going on foot from one village to another. When they are so situated, it is said they are 'so close that cocks could walk between them.'" 412 Tanuttam pannayati. Lit., "the diminution, [of human beings] is seen." . ' . 413 Gdmapi agama honti/ nigamdpi anigamU honti, nagarapv anagara honti, janapaddpi ajanapada honti. Lit., "villages have become non- villages, towns have become non-towns, cities have become non- cities, and provinces have become non-provinces." 414 Mp: "Illicit lust (adhammaraga): Lust is exclusively contrary to the Dhamma (adhamma), but it is not 'illicit lust" when it arises in rela­ tion to one's own possessions. lt is only 'illicit lust' when it arises in regard to the possessions of others. Unrighteous greed (visama- lobha): Though greed is never actually righteous, greed arisen for an object that belongs to oneself is called righteous greed. The greed arisen for an object belonging to another is called unrigh­ teous greed. Wrong Dhamma (micchddhamtna): indulgence in what is not a base." Mp-t: "Indulgence in some base of lust (ragassa vatthutthdnam) other than that considered good by the world's standards." 415 I read with Be, Ee, and Mp (Ce and Be): yakkha vale amanusse ossajjanti. Ce of AN has manusse for amanusse. Yakkhas are demonic spirits, sometimes depicted as killing human beings and devouring their flesh, but also capable of goodness and even realization of the Dhamma. Mp: "'Yakkhas' are the ruling yakkhas. They release fierce yakkhas on the paths of humans, and when these [yakkhas] get the chance, they deprive the people of their lives" (yakkha ti yakkhadhipatino. Vale amanusse ossajjanti ti candayakkhe manussapathe vissajjenti, te laddhokasa mahajanam jivitakkhayam pdpenti). Though I follow Mp, I wonder

"Yakkhas—wild, nonhuman— are released." 416 Kdcci te bhoto gotamassa vuttavadino ca bhavantam gotamam abhutena abbhdcikkhanti, dhammassd cdnudhammam byakaronti, na ca koci sahadhammiko vadanupato garayham thanam agacchati. So all three editions, but some variants have vadanuvado in place of vadanupato. I have discussed the formula in detail in CDB, p. 747, note 72, but T now believe that the Pali commentaries err in taking vadanupata (or vadanuvada) to mean "consequence of their assertion." I now take this term to be simply a synonym of garayham thanam." In support of this change, see 5:5, where sahadhammika vadanuvada garayha thana agacchanti and its oppo­ site, sahadhammika pasamsa thdna agacchanti, occur without refer­ ence to any prior assertion.

Another parallel at T II 493bi9-2i is similar, with nothing that corresponds to "consequence of an assertion." 417 Mp says that the "holy ones" (sante) are the supreme persons (uttamapurise): Buddhas, paccekabuddhas, and arahants. 418 Sappanne dhirasammate. Mp glosses this as if it meant "esteemed, honored, by the learned" (panditehi sammate sambhavite), but I take dhirasammate to mean "esteemed, honored, as sagely (or wise)." 419 The verse, which also occurs as Dhp 423 a-d, alludes to the three knowledges. 420 Mp: Yanna is "a thing to be given" (deyyadhamma; though this is already covered by the fourth item); saddha (Skt sraddha), "a meal in memory of the dead" (matakablwttam); thdlipdka, "a meal to be. given to excellent persons" (varapurisanam databbayuttam bhattam, but according to SED sv sthali, sthalipaka is more specifi­ cally a dish of barley or rice boiled in milk offered as an oblation); and deyyadhamma, "anything else that can be given." 421 Anuttaram brahmacariyogadham. Mp: "Nibbana is 'the unsur­ passed culmination of the spiritual life/ the supreme sup­ port for the spiritual life, which is the path to arahantship"

###### Motes to the Threes 1647

 nibbanogadham is used in conjunction with nibbanaparayanam and nibbdnapariyosanam, which suggests that the three terms are synonymous. It—a 1 112,11-12, glosses nibbanogadhaganu (the same phrase as in AN) with nibbfinasahkhdtam ogadham patittham pfiram gacchati ("it goes to the far shore, the support, the culmination consisting in nibbana"). This explanation, which is consistent with other commentaries, supports my rendering of nibbanogadha here as "culmination in nibbana" rather than "the plunge into nibbana," a rendering used by other translators. My rendering
 • of amatogadha in CDB (as at SN 45:139, 46:184, 48:42, 48:44, etc.) as "with the deathless as its ground" is not satisfactory. I am grateful to Vanarata for his comments on this term.’ 422 Mp: "He did not want to answer Ananda's question, so he tried to turn the discussion aside with words of praise." 423 Iddhipatihariyam adesandpatihariyam anusasampatihariyam. Also at . DN 11.3-8, 1212-14. 424 Nimittena'ddisati. Mp explains it as if it means an unrelated clue in the environment, but it may be a gesture or facial expression-— what we now call "body language"— that reveals to a skilled observer the other person's state of mind. 425 Vitakkavippharasaddam sutvd. Mp: "Having heard the sound of those muttering while asleep or oblivious, which [sound] arises by the diffusion of thought." I suspect that Mp misses the point. Since the examples in the sutta proceed from the coarser to the subtler, this one should be subtler than its predecessor. I think that what is intended is a subtle sound supposedly emanated by thought but not expressed verbally* 426 This must be referring to one in the second or higher jhanas. 427 Mp gives examples: "Think thoughts of desirelessness, not thoughts of sensuality, etc. Attend to the idea of impermanence, etc., not to permanence, etc. Abandon lust for sensual pleasure and enter a world-transcending path and fruit." 428 Asajja upanlya vaca bhdsita. Asajja usually means "having attacked," but this meaning seems too strong here. Mp merely paraphrases without giving much help: "The words you spoke hit upon my virtues and intrude on the domain of my virtues" (mama gune ghattetvd mam'evu gundnam santikam upanitd vdca bhdsita). I therefore assume that the words, without being insult­ ing, are considered inappropriate because they are making a personal inquiry. 429 "Sectarian tenets" renders titthdyatanani, lit. "bases of sects." The word tittha (Skt tlrtha), which originally meant a ford in a river, was used to designate religious teachings, probably in the sense

 where this metaphor governs a short discourse). Mp explains that the sects (tittha) are the sixty-two views (see DN 1.1.29—3.29, 1 12—39); the founders of the sects (titthakara) are those who for­ mulate those views; and the followers of the sects (titthiya) are those who approve of the views. The great teachers in Jainism are called in Skt tirthahkara. 430 Parampi gantva akiriyaya santhahanti. Mp glosses param with parampara, "lineage": "Even if they have gone to one of the three kinds of lineage, the lineage of teachers, the lineage of beliefs, and the lineage of [one's] individual existences" {acariyaparampara laddhiparampara attabhavaparampara ti etesu yamkihci paramparam gantva.pi). It is hard to see how this has any relevance to the context. Since param can also mean "later, further, afterward/' it seems the point being conveyed is that these positions, if extended further, eventuate in non-doing. On the basis of this understanding, I render parampigantva as "taken to their conclu­ sion." Santhahanti is, more literally, "stop at." 431 These are respectively the doctrines of the Jains, the theists, and non-causality, a doctrine elsewhere ascribed to Makkhali Gosala . (see 1:319, 3:137). 432 Mp: "They hold that one experiences feelings exclusively because of kamma created in the past." In this connection, see SN 36:21, IV 230-31, where the Buddha explains eight causes for illness or affliction, only one of which is the ripening of past kamma. Brahmali writes: "The point here seems to be that each of these unwholesome ways of acting is related to. particular feelings, and that those feelings (or experiences) can only be experienced . through those acts. It follows that if your kamma is such that you have to experience the feelings connected with those bad acts, then you will have to perform them." The same point, with suit­ able changes, applies to the following two tenets, that of God's creative activity and non-causality. In each case, agents escape responsibility for their actions. 433 At MN 14.15-19,1 92-93, and MN 101, II 214-28, the Buddha challenges the Niganthas with otjher arguments against their thesis that all feeling is due to past kamma. 434 Mp: "He has so far shown that these sectarian tenets, when taken to their conclusion, eventuate in non-doing, and are therefore empty and unemancipating, without substance. He now shows that the Dhamma he teaches is. substantial and emancipating (sarabhavanc'eva niyyanikabhavanca) ." 435 For a detailed analysis of the six elements, see MN 140.14—19, III 240-^3.

 the eighteen cases, using the 'feet' of thought and examination (vitakkavicarapadehi)." The word "feet" {pada) is used here because vicdra originally meant "traveling around." 437 Mp: "Why does he begin in this way? For ease of understanding. For the Tathagata wants to explain the revolving of the twelve conditions, so he shows the round by the term 'descent of a
 [future] embryo' (gabbhassdvakkanti). For when the round has been shown by the descent of a [future] embryo, what follows will be easy to understand. Whose six elements serve as the con­ dition, the mother's or the father's? It is neither, but descent of a [future] embryo occurs conditioned by the six elements of the being taking rebirth. " ‘Mp cites MN 38.26, I 265,35-66,6 (see too MN 93.18, II 156>3o-57,3). 438 This may be a unique instance where the noble truths of the ori­ gin and cessation of suffering are explicated by way of the full twelve factors of dependent origination. At SN 12:43, II 72-73,. the origination (samudaya) of suffering is explained by way of the links from consciousness through craving; its passing away (atthangahta), by way of the cessation of the links from craving through old age and death. In the Chinese parallel, MA 13 (at TI 435a24—436aio)> the second and third truths are not explained by way of dependent origination b ut according to the stock for­ mulations as found in SN 56:11, V 421, and elsewhere. 439 Tin'imdni bhikkhave amdtaputtikdni bhayam ti assutava puthujjcmo bhdsati. Lit. "There are these three [things] that the uninstructed worldling speaks of as 'without-mother-and-son perils.'" 440 Tini samdtaputtikaniyeva bhaydni amdtaputtikdni bhaydnl ti assutava , puthujjario bhdsati. Literally: "There are three with-mother-and- son perils that the uninstructed worldling speaks of as 'without- mother-and-son perils.'" The perils are obviously the great fire, the flood, and the turbulence. Since these initially separate mother and son, one can call them "perils that separate mother and son." But since, in the end, mother and son find one another, one can also call them perils when mother and son reconnect. 441 Mp: "Having shown in a provisional way (pariynyato) the perils that separate mother and son, he now shows in a non-provisional way (nippariydyena) the perils that separate mother and son." 442 In translating the names of these different types of beds and their appurtenances I have relied on Horner's translation of Vin I 192,i4-i9 (1951, 4:256-57). She based her renderings on Sp V 1086,1-1087,12, which corresponds to Mp II 292-93. 443 Dibbam uccasayanamahdsayanam, brahmam uccasayanamahdsayanam,

 samaye cahkamo hoti. Mp says that his walking back and forth is celestial when, having entered the four jhanas, he walks back and forth; and his walking back and forth is celestial when, after emerging from the four jhanas, he walks back and forth. This seems to imply that walking can. occur even with the mind in jhana. This, however, is contradicted by the dominant under­ standing that jhana is a state of uninterrupted absorption in an object, in which case intentional movements like walking would not be possible. Mp-t explains the first case of Mp (walking after entering the jhanas) to mean that he walks back and forth immedi­ ately after emerging from the jhana, while the second case (walk­ ing after emerging) to mean that he walks back and forth after having emerged some time earlier. The same explanation holds for the divine and the noble beds- 445 Mp: "This shows the lust abandoned by the path of arahantship at the site of the great enlightenment. By means of reviewing he refers to the attainment of fruition.." . . 446 Mp explains that he had been commissioned by the wanderers in his own community to take ordination with the bhikkhus, learn the secret of their success (which they believed to be a kind of magic they used to attract followers), and then return and share it with them. After his ordination he concluded that the Patimokkha was the key to their success. Having learned the Patimokkha, he returned to the wanderers and reported that he had learned the Dhamma of the Buddha's followers. The back­ ground story is similar to that of the Suslma Sutta (SN 12:70, II 119—28) but has a different outcome. 447 Ee has an additional line here: maya kho Sarabha pannayati samananam Sakyaputtiyanam dhammo: "Sarabha, the Dhamma of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan son has been seen by me." Be has a variant on this line in parentheses but Ce does not have anything corresponding to it. 448 A t M N 3 5 . 1 3 - 1 4 , 1 231,27-28,32- 35, it is s a i d : " I f a n y o n e , w h e n a s k e d

 statement. In Ce the disjunctive va occurs only twice in this sen­ tence, suggesting only two alternatives. Ee has three occurrences of va, but tunhibhuto va mahkubhuto va divides two terms that normally belong to a single alternative. Be has only one va, which leaves the question of the alternatives even more obscure. I have chosen to separate "he would answer evasively . . and "display anger, hatred, and bitterness," even though we often find the sequence without a disjunction: annenannam paticarati, bahiddha katham apanameti, kopanca dosanca appaccayanca patukaroti. In this respect, I have followed the divisions of the Chinese parallel, SA 970, which at TII 2 5 0 b 2 i-2 3 does offer three distinct alternatives: ° • ?£fl] "He would divert the discussion to an outside subject, or (g£), overcome by anger and conceit, would unreasonably display hostility and impatience, or (l£) would silently harbor shame, his head lowered, privately reflecting." 451 Yassakho pana te atthaya dhammo desito so na niyyati takkarassa samma diikkhakkhayaya ti. Mp. takes yassa atthaya to mean "the purpose for which" the Dhamma is taught, identified as the destruction of lust, etc., and "the Dhamma" to be meditation on unattractiveness, etc. The verb niyyati means "goes out" (to the complete destruction of suffering). Takkarassa is likely to be a sandhi formation: takkaro assa. I have been able to track down two Chinese versions of the phrase (there maybe more): (1) EA 27.6 (T II 645cio-n) reads IS ("it is impossible that this outward-going Dharma of the noble ones does not go out to the complete end of suffering"). (2) EA 46.4 (T II 776c28-
 • 777a2) has » ° * M H ■ A • ° MSfciA ("By this Dharma taught by me the noble ones go out correctly to the complete end of suffering. It is impossible that any ascetic (etc.) could come and say: '[They] have not reached the complete end of suffering'"). 452 Here the Chinese of SA 970, at T II 250b28, has simply "he got up from his seat and left" (^^JEffn^) without a supernormal departure. 453 Vacaya sattitodakena sanjambharim akamsu. Be and Ee have sanni- todakem for Ce sattitodakena. The Chinese counterpart atTII 250cs says simply: "they reproached him and censured him to his face"

###### 1652 The A hgu ttara Nikaya

 order to bring out the sense. Mp (Ce) glosses ambakamaddari as a small chicken (khuddakakukkutika) and phussaka as a large chicken (mahakukkuta). The Chinese parallel, at T II 250c3, has: "Just as a woman might try to make the sound of a man but only makes the sound of a woman" > fiHtBPfF~&M). Pali purisakaravitam might be understood as the crying out of a man, and ambaka as a woman, but in the absence of a clear and simple contrast between ambaka and purisa in the same edition, I follow Mp's gloss. 455 Be Kesamiitti. This discourse is best known under the name "The Kalama Sutta." A Chinese parallel is M A16 (at T1438bi3-439c2z). I will note below some of the important- ways it-differs from the Pali version. 456 From the last sentence of the preceding paragraph through this sentence, MA 16 reads instead: "Gotama, having heard this, we gave rise to doubt and uncertainty: 'Of these ascetics or brah­ mins, which [speak] truthfully and which [speak] falsely?'" The Blessed One said: "Kalamas, do not give rise to dOubt and. uncertainty. For what reason? Because when there is doubt and uncertainty, there will arise perplexity. Kalamas, you yourselves do not have pure wisdom with which to know whether there is an afterlife or not. You yourselves do not have pure wisdom about what deeds are transgressions and what deeds are not transgressions." 457 These ten inadequate sources of knowledge may be divided into three categories: (1) Thefirst, comprising the first four criteria, are propositions based on tradition. These include "oral tradition" (anussava), generally understood to refer to ,the Vedic tradition; "lineage" {parampara), an unbroken succession of teachings or teachers; "hearsay" (or "report"; itikira), popular opinion or gen­ eral consensus; and "a collection of scriptures" (pitakasampada), a collection of texts regarded as infallible. In the Buddha's day these would have been orally transmitted rather than written. (2) The second set comprises the next four terms referring to four types of reasoning; their differences need not detain us here, but since the Buddha himself often uses reasoning, they must all involve reasoning from hypothetical premises rather than from empirical observation. (3) The third set, consisting of the last two items, contains two types of personal authority: the first, "seeming competence" (bhabbarupata), is the personal charisma of the speaker (perhaps including his external qualifications); the . second is the authority of the speaker as one's guru (Pali garu being identical with Skt guru).

 rich man, Ce has the right readings kathainrupam and evarupam, in agreement with Be and Ee. 555 I follow Ce here: dhamati sandhamati niddhamati. Tam hoti jatarupam dhantam sandhantam niddhantam, anihitam anikkhittakasavam. Be has the same up to niddhantam, but it then omits anihitam and reads aniddhantakasavam where Ce has anikkhittakasavam. Ee allows a bracketed alternative: dhamati sandhamati [na] nid­ dhamati. Tam hoti jatariipam dhantam sandhantam aniddhantam, anihitam aninmtakasavam. An older Sri Lankan edition mentioned in a note to Ce also has aninmtakasavam. 556 I read with Ce and Be nativitakko, as against Ee jativitakko, "thoughts about [social] class." 557 Anavannattipatisamyutto vitakko. Lit. "thought connected with not being looked down upon." The Chinese parallel, SA 1246 (at T II 341 £12- 13), has "thought about rebirth in heaven" 558 Dhammavitakka. Mp glosses this as thoughts connected with the ten corruptions of insight (dasa vipassan'upakkilesavitakka), but it seems this could just as well mean reflections on the teaching or on the meditation subject. 559 Readings differ between nappatipassaddhaladdho and nappati- passaddhiladdhc. Discrepancies are found even within the same text. Ee is consistent, reading nappatippassaddhaladdho in the negative sentence and patippassaddhaladdho in the positive counterpart. Be, however, has nappatippassaddhaladdho and pati- ppassaddhiladdho in the respective sentences. To make matters more confusing, Mp (Be) inverts the forms, reading, nappatip- passaddhiladdho in the lemma of the comment on the negative term, but patippassaddhaladdho in the lemma of the comment on the positive term. Mp (Be), commenting on this sutta, explains nappatippassaddhiladdho as "not gained by the full tranquil- izing of defilements" {na kilesapatippassaddhiya laddho) and patippassaddhaladdho as "gained by the full tranquilizing of defile- . ments" (kilesapatippassaddhiya laddho). Ce reads na patippassaddhiladdho and patippassaddhiladdho in the sutta, but Mp (Ce) has na patippassaddhaladdho and patip­ passaddhaladdho in the respective lemmas. Moreover, in 5:27 (where only the positive term occurs), Ce and Be have patip­ passaddhaladdho, as against Ee patippassaddhiladdho. Mp (Ce) here reads patippassaddhiladdho in the lemma, as against Mp (Be) patippassaddhaladdho. Mp says that patippassaddham and patip- passaddhi are one in meaning (idam atthato ekam), proposing two resolutions: "It is gained by the full tranquilizing of defile­ ments, or it has gained the full tranquilization of defilements

###### (kilesapatippassaddhiya laddhatta kilesapatippassaddhibhavam va laddhatta), thus it is patippassaddhiladdho." 560 Ce and Ee sasatikhdraniggaylmvaritavato; in place of —vato Be reads the termination as gato. I interpret sasahkhara as "forceful" (lit. "with exertion"); n ^ggayha as "having suppressed"; varita as "reined in"; and (following Ce) -vato as "checked." A render­ ing based on the Be variant might be: "but is reached when [the defilements] are reined in by forcefully suppressing [them]." 561 Ce and Ee na sasankharaniggayhavaritavato; Be —gato. SA 1246 (atT II 3 4 1 c 2i -22) has: "The bhikkhu attains concentration that is not maintained by exertion; he attains the peaceful and sublime, the quiescent happy state, the unified mind, in which all the taints . are destroyed" (bbfrf#!#.^^ ° °

 • -562 Yassa' yassa ca abhinna sacchikaramyassa dhammassa ciitani abhininnameti abhinna sacchikiriydya tatra tatreva sakkhibhabbatani papunati sati sati ayatane. Mp explains the "suitable basis" as "past causes and the presently obtainable jhana, and other things, . which are the basis for the direct knowledges" (pubbahetusahkhate. cevd idani ca patiladdhabbe abhinnapadakajjhanadibhede ca sati sati karane). The expression occurs at Vism 371 ,26-33, Ppn 11.122, and is commented upon at Vism-mht (VRI ed. I 429). Vism 3 7 6 ,28—
**378** ,2, Ppn 12.14--19, explains the basis for the direct knowledges
###### to be the concentrated mind that has acquired eight qualities: namely, it is (1) purified, (2) cleansed, (3 ) unblemished, (4) rid of defilement, (5) malleable, (6) wieldy, (7 ) steady, arid (8 ) attained to imperturbability. Alternatively, it says, "concentrated" may be considered the first quality and "steady and attained to imper­ turbability" jointly constitute the eighth. 563 This begins the standard canonical passage on the six kinds of direct knowledge (abhiflftfi): The first five are commented on in detail in Vism chaps. 12 and 13. 564 I here follow Ce and Be, which put the liberated mind before the unliberated mind, as against Ee, which inverts them. 565 Ee treats this as a continuation of the preceding sutta, while in Ce and Be, which are clearly correct, it is a different sutta. With the next sutta, my numbering will again exceed Ee's by two. 566 Tini nimittani. Mp glosses as "three causes" (tini karanani). The three nimittas are samadhinimitta, paggahanimitta, and upekkhanimitta. 567 In. SN, this "template" and the two to follow are applied sepa­ rately to the four elements (14:31-33, II 169-73), the five aggre­ gates (22:26—28, III 27—31), and the six sense bases (35:13—18, IV

 568 Ee treats this sutta as a continuation of the preceding one, whereas Ce and Be, which I follow, consider it distinct. Thus my numbering will exceed Ee's by three. 569 Again, Ee treats this sutta as a continuation of the preceding one, whereas Ce and Be, which I follow, count it separately. Thus from the next sutta on my numbering exceeds Ee's by four. 570 SetugMto gite, setughato nacce. Mp: "Let there be the demolition of the condition for singing. He shows: 'Abandon singing together with its cause.' The same method with regard to dancing." On setughato, see above, note 497. Alarn oodharnmappamoditanam satam sitam sitamattaya. Mp: "When there is a reason to smile [in. rejoicing-in the Dhamma], it is projper to smile merely by show­ ing the tips of your teeth simply to show that you are pleased." 571 I here use "deed" for kammanta and "action" for kamma. In this
 context it seems there is no real difference between the two, the1 ' text itself shifting from one to the other as if they were synony­ mous. "Tainted" renders avassuta, past participle of avassavati, related via the verb savati, "to flow/' to the noun tisava. 572 I use one word where the Pali uses two synonymous terms for death, maranam and kalakiriya. 573 Mp: "This kamma brings the origination—that is, the accumula­ tion—of other kamma leading toward the round [of rebirths].". 574 Ee treats this sentence as the end of the sutta and the next sen­ tence as the beginning of a new sutta. Ce and Be, in accordance with the uddana verse, take this to be a single sutta divided into two parts by way of the unwholesome and wholesome roots. 575 Mp: "This kamma leads to the origination of kammas going toward the end of the round [of rebirths]." 576 Ee again treats this sentence as the end of the sutta and the next as the beginning of a new sutta (no, 110), while Ce and Be, which I follow, take this to be a single sutta divided into two sections. My numbering, from the next sutta on, exceeds Ee's by two. 577 Here— and in the parallel passages below—I follow the Ce read­ ing: . . . tadabhinivajjeti. Tadabhinivajjetvfi cetasa abhivirajetva. Be has tadabhinivatteti. Tadabhinivattetva cetasa abhinivijjhitva. Ee has tadabhinwaddheti and tadabhinivaddhetva, which cannot be correct. However, just below Ee agrees with Ce, as against Be, in reading abhivirajetva. 578 Pahnaya ativijjha passati. Mp: "One sees having penetrated it with the wisdom of the path together with insight." 579 Sokamesupatavyatamapajjati(Beadds fayabeforekamesu,probably representing taya ditthiya). Mp: " Indulgence: [the view that] they are to be drunk, to be enjoyed; [he thinks they are] to be enjoyed

###### one who is thirsty" {pivitabbatam paribhunjitabbatam nirasahkena cittena pipasitassa pamyapivanasadisam paribhunjitabbatam). Ps II 371,22-24, commenting on patabyatam apajjanti at MN 1305,21, says: "He falls into [the view that} one should drink up sensual objects with the defilement of sensuality, that they are to be enjoyed according to one's pleasure" (te vatthukamesu kilesakamena patabyatam pivitabbatam, yatharuci paribhunjitabbatam apajjanti ti attho). Patabba (= patavya) occurs as an optative participle of pivati, to drink, at Vin II 208,ii.,MN 45.2, I 305, ascribes this view to "ascetics and brahmins" who "consort with women wanderers wearing their hair in:a topknot." 580 According to the Theravada Abhidhamma, on passing away from the formless realm, a worldling may be reborn on the same formless plane, on a higher formless plane, or in the sense sphere with a three-rooted rebirth consciousness. This means that they will be reborn either as an intelligent human being or as a deva. Rebirth into the lower planes can occur in later rebirths, but not in the rebirth immediately following the fall from the formless realm. See CMA 226-27. . 581 I read with Ce and Ee: yadidam gatiya upapattiya sati. Be omits sati here (and in the next two paragraphs), but includes it in the parallels at 4:123 and 4:125. Mp, commenting on 4:123, explains: "When there is future destination and rebirth, the noble disciple who is a trainee does not descend to a lower rebirth but attains final nibbana in the same form-sphere (existence [or] in a higher realm." The same applies, with the appropriate modification, to those reborn in formless-sphere existence. Mp-t to 4:123 sheds light on the question how noble disciples can be reborn in the formless realm: "When the Buddha speaks of the life spans of humans and devas, he does not give specific figures for the life span [of those] in the four planes of misery and earth-bound devas. Why not? Because in hell, kamma alone determines [the life span]; one suffers there until one's kamma is exhausted. The same holds for the other planes of misery. Kamma also determines the life span for earth-bound devas. For some reborn there remain there only for a week, some for two weeks, and some for an eon. "Among humans, some laypeople become stream-enterers and attain the fruit of once-returning, the fruit of non-returning, and even arahantship. Of these, stream-enterers, etc., can remain
 [in the lay life] their entire lives, but arahants either attain final nibbana or go forth [into homelessness]. Why? Because arahant­ ship is the most virtuous state and the lay life is inferior. It isn't possible for arahants to sustain the most virtuous state in an

###### away] or go forth. But when earth-bound devas attain arahant­ ship they remain their entire lives; stream-enterers and once- re turners among the six classes of sens e-sphere devas remain, their entire lives. For a non-returner it is suitable to go to a form-sphere existence, and for arahants to attain final nibbana. Why? Because there is no chance that they might regress. In the form and formless realms, all remain for their entire life spans. Stream-enterers and once-returners reborn in the form realm do not return to this world, but attain final nibbana there. They are called'jhana non-returners/ "But what determines [rebirth] for those who gain the eight meditative attainments? The jhana in which they are proficient does, for they are reborn in accordance with whatever they are proficient in. If they are proficient in all, what determines
 [their rebirth]? The attainment of the base of neither-perception- nor-non-perception, for they are definitely reborn in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.. For noble disciples reborn among the nine brahma worlds, rebirth may occur there
 [in the same plane] or in a higher one, but not in a lower one. But worldlings may be reborn in the same plane, in a higher one, or in a lower one. Noble disciples in the five pure abodes and the four formless planes may be reborn in the same plane or in a higher one. A non-returner reborn in the plane of the first jhana purifies the nine brahma worlds and attains final nibbana while dwelling at the peak. Three deva worlds are called the 'best states of exis­ tence': the plane of great fruit (vehapphala), Akanittha, and the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. Non-returners reborn in these three states do not go higher, nor lower, but attain final nibbana right there." 582 Apannako mani. Mp-t says it is a special kind of die with six sur­ faces, similar to a jewel, used by those devoted to the game of dice (evam chahi talehi samannagato pasakakilapasutanam manisadiso pasakaviseso). I use the more familiar plural form rather than the singular "die." 583 The definition of mental purity here replicates the section of the Satipatthana Sutta on contemplation of the five hindrances (DN 22.13, II 300,4-301,24; MN 10.36, 1 6 0 ,7- 36). 584 Again, I rely on the summary verse in Ce (electronic) for titles. 585 Mp: "In the first twenty years after the enlightenment, the ' Tathagata often stayed among the deva communities (deva- kulesuyeva): sometimes at the Capala Shrine, sometimes at the Sarandada, sometimes at the Bahuputta, and sometimes at the Gotamaka. Since he was living at Vesall at this time, he stayed at the abode of the Gotamaka spirit." Mp explains that this sutta

###### background story, told at Ps I 56-59, and translated at Bodhi 2006: 82—86, relates that a group of brahmins had taken ordina­ tion under the Buddha and quickly mastered his teachings. Filled with pride on account of their learning, they no longer went to listen to the Dhamma. The Buddha spoke the Mulapariyaya Sutta to cut down their pride. Unable to understand it, they were humbled and apologized to the Buddha. Sometime later the Bud­ dha spoke this Gotamaka Sutta to guide them to arahantship. 586 Mp-t explains thus: "Through direct knowledge (abhinfiaya): He teaches the Dhamma after directly knowing, according to actu­ ality, the Dhamma to be taught, distinguished by way of the wholesome and so forth and by. way of the aggregates and so forth; and after directly knowing the method to teach those who are to be guided in accordance with their propensities, tenden­ cies, characters, and dispositions. With a basis (sdnidanam); With conditions (sappaccayam), with grounds (sakaranam), having brought forth a reason (hetu), which might be the inclination of those to be guided, a question, or a special incident; Antidotal (sappatihariyam): an antidote is a remedy (patihnrat}a) for lust and so forth. The Dhamma is accompanied by these, so it is 'anti­ dotal.' For the Teacher teaches the Dhamma just by way of the elimination (patisedhanavasen'eva) of lust and so forth." The term sappatihariya is problematic. Elsewhere patiharya is used in the sense of a wonder or miracle, as in 3:60 (at I 170— 72), which speaks of the three "wonders": of psychic potency, thought-reading, and instruction. PED, sv patiharya, sees sappatihariya as derived from this usage and suggests, in contexts related to the Dhamma, "wonderful, extraordinary, sublime." I find it hard, however, to agree that such a meaning is intended, in this context. The verb patiharati means "to strike back," and the causative patihareti "to repel, to avoid." I believe that this sense is relevant both to its use here and in relation to miracles. A miracle "strikes against" the mind's fixed conceptual premises and opens it to the reality of the wondrous. But the Dhamma strikes in a different way. It "strikes against" distorted views and defilements, and thus it is counteractive or antidotal. This inter­ pretation is supported by 8:70 (IV 310-11), where the Buddha states that his disciples "can thoroughly refute let reasoned ways the current tenets of others and teach the sappatihariya Dhamma" (uppannam parappavadam sahadhammena suniggshitam niggahetva sappatihariyam dhammam desessanti). Here the sappatihariya char­ acter of the Dhamma must be related, not to miracles, but to its ability to counteract opposed tenets. Thus "antidotal" or "coun­

 Alara Kalama's hermitage. Alara Kalama was one of the medi­ tation masters under whom the future Buddha trained before his enlightenment. See MN I 163-64. 588 Apparently this is Hatthaka of Alavi (see 1:251), though Mp does not identify him as such. 589 Mp explains dhamma ... pavattino as "the Buddha-word that you learned in the past" (pubbe uggahitabuddhavacanam). 590 Mp: "Teachings that he has forgotten because he neglected to xecite them." 591 Aviha: One of the five pure abodes (suddhavasa) into which only non-retumers are reborn. . . 592 Goyogapilakkhasmim. Mp: "Near the fig tree that had grown up at the place for selling cattle." PED.explains pilakkha as a wavy- leaved fig tree. 593 Rittassadam bahirassadam. Mp: "Dissatisfied: lacking the pleasure of the jhanas.

DOP defines the word as "(what is) left over; (what is) polluted, impure." 595 Be amagandhena; Ce and Ee amagandhe. See Amagandha-sutta, Sn 239-52. Mp: "The foui odor consisting in anger." 596 Samvegamapadi. Mp: "He became a stream-enterer." The suttas normally use a stock formula to indicate attainment of stream- entry, but nothing of this formula is found in the present text. . 597 Ce reads pada b aladdha samamat'tano; Be aladdha samathamattano; Ee sammamattano. I prefer the Ce reading. All three editions read the verb in pada c as pareti, which Mp glosses with gacchati. 598 Nasayitvana makkhika. The absolutive is from the verb naseti, "to . destroy." 599 The exact import of this is not clear to me. Perhaps the sense is that women are best kept within the home rather than permitted to go out in public places on their own. The Chinese parallel, EA 22.4 (at T II 607b26-607cn), is exactly like the Pali, though it includes a verse which simply reiterates the same statements as in the prose portion of the sutta. 600 The first two are at 2:47.

Lit., "the three kinds of good horses among horses and the three kinds of good horses among m en/' 607 Ee at I 291-92 Combines this sutta and the next two into one, 3:140 in its numbering..Ce and Be count each separately. See 11:10, which merges them into a single sutta supplemented by two additional factors for a total of eleven qualities. From 3:146 on, my numbering exceeds Ee's by five. 608 The one beyond training (asekha) is the arahant. 609 Ee does not number this as a separate vagga but titles it Acdaka- vagga. Ce counts it as the sixth vagga in the third Fifty, called Patipadavagga. Be also counts it as the sixth vagga (sixteenth in its total for the Threes), called Acelalcavagga, "Chapter on the Naked Ascetic." 610 I base this title on the uddana verse of Be. Neither Ce nor Be assigns a title to this sutta; neither Ce nor Ee has an uddana verse.

 extreme of indulgence in sensual pleasure; the blistering way of practice (nijjhama patipada), to the extreme of self-rhortification. Those are the two extremes that the Buddha rejected in his first discourse (SN 56:11, V 421,4-9). 612 The following list of ascetic practices is also at DN 1 166—67; MN I 77-78, 307—8, 342-43. 613 Ee compresses all these into a single sutta numbered 152.1 follow Ce and Be in counting each as a distinct sutta. 614 Ee joins each pair of suttas, respectively on qualities that lead to hell and to heaven, into a single, sutta, and thus counts ten suttas (153-62> in its enumeration). Ce and Be, which I follow, enumerate each pair of contrasting suttas separately and thus count tvventy suttas. . 615 Be and Ee count only one sutta here, 184 and 163 in their respec­ tive enumerations.

Mp glosses dlghamaddhanam with cirakalam ("a long time") and explains sandhavitam as "roamed . by going from one state of existence to another" (bhqvato bhavam gamanavasena sandhavitam): 620 Bhavanetti. Mp: "The rope of existence (bhavarajju) is a name for craving. Just as oxen are bound by a rope around the neck, so this leads beings from one existence to another. Therefore it is called the conduit to existence." 621 Cakkhuma parinibbuto. Mp: "He attained nibbana by the extinction of defilements.

 624 These three verses recur at 10:89 with reference to the slander­ ous bhikkhu Kokalika. The story, including verses, is also at SN 6:9-10, 1 149-53, and Sn 3:10, pp. 123-31. Vicinati mukhena so kalim, kalina tena sukham na vindati. This could also have been rendered: "The fool collects a disaster with his mouth." Kali means both disaster and the losing throw at dice. 625 Mp: "This disaster is trifling, that is, the loss of wealth at dice along with all that one owns, including oneself." Mp glosses sugatesu, "holy ones," as sammaggatesu puggalesu, "persons who have rightly attained," thus referring to all arahants, not only to the Buddha. . . . . 626 Satam sahassanam nirabbudanam / chattimsati pahca ca abbiidani. I translate following Mp, which says of the numbers: "A hundred thousand jiirabbudas, plus thirty-six more nirab.budas, plus five abbudas" (satam sahassanan ti nirabbudagananaya satasahassam; chattim sati ti aparani ca chattimsati nirabbiidani; puitca ca ti abbudagananaya ca pahca abbudani). Vanarata, however,, holds that pahca cannot directly qualify abbudanam and therefore he would conjoin sahassanam with chattimsati and pahca as well, making thirty-six thousand additional nirabbudas and five thou­ sand abbudas. Mp, commenting on 10:89, explains the Buddhist numbering scheme as follows: one koti = ten million; a koti of kotis = one pakoti; a koti of pakotis = one kotipakoti; a koti of kotipakotis = one nahuta; a koti of nahutas = one ninnahuta; a koti of ninnahutas — one abbuda; twenty abbudas = one nirabbuda. 627 The verse is also at 3:31 and 4:63, but here dhammacariyaya replaces paricariyaya. 628 In Pali: anusotagamlpuggalo, patisotagami puggalo, thitatto puggalo, tinno parahgato thale titthati brahmano. 629 Reading with Be and Ee upagamino, as against Ce upagahino. 630 Paripunnasekho. Mp: "One firm in fulfillment of the training" (sikkhfiparipiiriya thito). A train ee (sekha) is one who has entered the irreversible path to liberation but has not yet attained arahant­ ship. The arahant is asefdia, "one beyond training." 631 In Pali: suttam, geyyam, veyyakaranan, gatha, udanam, itivuttakam, jatakam. abbhutadhammam, vedallam. This is the early ninefold divi­ sion of the Dhamma, eventually superseded by the arrangement of the texts into the five Nikayas. See Norman 1983: 15-16; Nor­ man 2006a: 172-73.

Ce reads nassa sampajjate sutam here and tassa sampajjate sutam in the next verse, while Ee has nassa sampajjate sutam in both places. Mp supports Be by explaining, in relation to this verse: "His learning can be said to have succeeded because this person has used what he has learned to achieve the purpose of learning." And in relation to the next verse, Mp says: "It [his learning] does not succeed because he has not achieved the purpose of learning." The verses are cited at Vism 48, Ppn 1.136, but with differences in readings among the several editions. 633 Mp glosses brahma here as "best, supreme, pure" (settham utiamam visuddham) and identifies brahmacakka with dhammacakka, the wheel of the Dhamma. 634 See 3:64 and p. 1651, note 451. 635 Vanarata writes with regard to pada c: "I think that patvd is a mistaken adaptation from an original early Pali pattd, which can be both absolutive and past participle. When Pali was reshaped, the wrong alternative was chosen. Pattd, being past participle, should have been left unchanged'" (personal communication). 1 read pada d with Be visaradam vadapathativattam, a read­ ing shared with older Sinhala manuscripts.

The noun sokhumma, from the common adjective sukhuma, is rare and in the Nikayas appears to occur only here and in a compound at Th 437. Mp's explanation seems to me problematic. I would identify exquisite^ ness of form with the form perceived in the fourth jhana, exqui­ siteness of feeling with the neither-painful-nof-pleasant feeling occurring in the fourth jhana and the formless attainments, exquisiteness of perception with the perception in the base of nothingness, and exquisiteness of volitional activities with the residual volitional activities in the base of neither-perception- nor-non-perception. 646 Tread with Ce and Be sa ve sammaddaso bhikkhu.

And in the next verse: na chanda na dosa na moha na bhaya ca gamino. 649 SN 6:2, I 138—40, records the incident in direct narrative mode. It includes a fifth factor: the knowledge and vision of liberation. Since it is set at the time of the Buddha's enlightenment, it makes no mention of the Sahgha, which arose only after the Buddha began to teach. 650 Ce reads atthakamena; Be and Ee have attakamena, "desiring self/' In pada d, the plural of Buddha is in the Pali, buddhanasasanam. Possibly the compound is a corruption of buddhanusasanam, "the Buddha's instruction," which would preserve a singular. 651 The placement of this sutta in lihe period just after the Buddha's enlightenment seems strange. The words of the brahmins sug­ gest that the Buddha, from a position of authority, participated in regular discussions with brahmins; yet he surely would not have done so before he began his career as a teacher. See 8:11, where a brahmin makes the same charge against the Buddha at a later time when he had already become a successful teacher. 652 I follow Ce in taking the poem to consist of three stanzas of

Be divides it into four stanzas, the first with six padas, the other three with four padas. 653 In pada c, I read with Ce sannato thiradhammesu, as against Be and Ee sannato dhiro dhammesu, "self-controlled and steadfast among phenomena." In this, I follow Vanarata's suggestion (in a personal communication) that the Ce reading "has the merit of both fitting the meter better and supplying a pun (between thira and thera, firm and elder)." This clause corresponds to the jhanas, "factors of firmness" referring to samadhi. Mp glosses "who clearly sees the meaning with wisdom" (panfidyattham vipassati) as seeing the meaning of the four noble truths with the wisdom of the path along with insight. It explains "gone beyond all phenomena" (paragu sabbadhammanam) as "gone beyond all such phenomena as the five aggregates" and "gone to the con­ summation of all [good] qualities" by the sixfold going beyond (chabbidhena paragatnanena): with respect to direct knowledge, full understanding, abandoning, development, realization, and meditative attainments. Mp does not explain the repetition of patibhanavd ("discerning") in the verse, which seems peculiar. 654 Also at It §112, 121-23. 655 Mp identifies the world (loka) with die truth of suffering. The four tasks that the Tathagata has accomplished here correspond to the four tasks regarding the four noble truths—fully understanding the truth of suffering, abandoning the truth of its origin, realizing its cessation, and developing the path—but with "fully aw~ak- ened" (abhisambuddha) replacing "fully understood" (parinnata) in regard to the first truth. See SN 56:11, V 422. 656 Mp, like other commentaries, explains the seen (dittha) as the visible-form base; the heard (swta) as the sound base; the sensed (muta) as the bases of odor, taste, and tactile sensations; and the cognized (vinndtam) as the mental-phenomena base. The three terms "reached, sought after, examined by the mind" (pattam pariyesitam anuvicaritam manasa) are simply elaborations of the cognized. Mp also explains that the suffix -gata, lit. "gone," in the derivation of the word "Tathagata," means the same as abhisam­ buddha, "fully awakened to." 657 Ce and Ee have merely parinibbayati, as against Be anupadisesaya nibbanadhatuya parinibbayati, "attains final nibbana by way of the nibbana element without residue remaining."

 661 According to Mp, Kalaka was a wealthy financier and the father- in-law of Anathapindika's daughter Culasubhadda. At the time of her marriage, he had been a devotee of the naked ascetics and knew nothing about the Buddha or his teaching. Calasubhadda contrived to get him to invite the Buddha and the monks for a meal offering. After the meal, the Buddha gave a discourse that established him in the fruit of stream-entry. Kalaka then built a monastery in his park and donated both monastery and park to the Buddha. One day., when the bhikkhus who were natives of Saketa were sitting in the meeting; hall discussing the Buddha's success in converting Kalaka, the Buddha read their minds and knew they were ready for a discourse that would settle them in arahantship. It would also cause the great earth to quake up to its boundaries. Hence he addressed the bhikkhus. 662 Mp: "By these three terms (jariami, abbhahnasim, viditam) the plane of omniscience (sabbannutabhumi) is indicated." In the his- . tory of Buddhism, as well as in modern scholarship, the question whether the Buddha claimed omniscience has been a subject of debate. The Buddha certainly rejected the claim that one could know everything all the time (see MN 71.5,1 482,4- is) ag well as the claim that one could know everything simultaneously (see MN 90.8, II 127,28-30). But he also says that to hold that he totally rejects the possibility of omniscience is to misrepresent him (MN 90.5, II 126,31—27,11). Thus it seems to follow that what the Buddha rejected is the possibility of continuous and simultaneous knowl­ edge of everything, but not discrete and intentional knowledge of whatever can be known (which would exclude much of the future, since it is not predetermined). 663 Tam tathagata na upatthasi. Mp: "The Tathagata did not become subservient to any object at the six sense doors, that is, he did not take it up (na upaganchi) through craving or views.

###### of craving, conceit, or views; and so for the other objects.. By this passage, the plane of emptiness (sunnatdbhumi) is explained/7 667 The word tadi, originally a simple referential term meaning "that one," takes on a special sense when used to designate the Buddha or an arahant. Nidd I 114-15 explains that an arahant is called tad! because he has transcended preferences, given up (icatto) defilements, crossed (tinno) the floods, and has a liberated (mutto) mind. Mp: "Being ever stable . ... is a stable one (tadlyeva tadl): 'Stable' means exactly the same (ekasadisata). The Tathagata is the same both in gain and loss; fame and obscurity, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain. . . . By this the plane of the stable one (tadibhumi) has been explained. As he concluded the teaching with these five planes, on each of the five occasions the earth quaked as testimony." 668 I paraphrase Mp's explanation of this verse: "He would not take even one claim of the speculative theorists. who are 'self-constrained' (sayasa'mvutesu) in the sense that they are constrained or blocked by their conceptions—to be categorical or supreme and trust it, believe it, fall back on it as true or false (evam saccaffi musa vdpi param uttamam katva na odaheyya, na sadda- heyya, na pattiyayeyya), thinking: 'This alone is true and anything else is false.'" This explanation nicely connects the verse to the prose line, "the Tathagata did not become subservient.to it." 669 Mp identifi.es the "dart" as the dart of views (ditthisalla). Else­ where craving is spoken of as the dart, for instance, at MN II 258,27, and SN 140,7; in still other passages, the dart is sorrow, as at 5:48, 5:50/ 670 Samvarattham pahanattham viragattham nirodhattham. These four aims of the spiritual life, it seems, are the reason for including this sutta in the Fours. 671 Mp glosses nibbanogadhagaminam with nibbdnassa antogaminam, "leading into nibbana." 672 All three editions that I consulted have mahantehi, but I prefer the reading in It §35, 28,17, mahattehi, glossed by It-a 1 112,25, mahd- dtumehi ularajjhdsayehi, "by the great spirits, by those of lofty disposition." 673 The sutta also occurs as It §108,112—13. My division of the sutta into four parts is hypothetical, but apart from this no fourfold scheme is apparent. 674 Na me te bhikkhave bhikkhu mamakd. Mp.

 that cow's urine into wrhich gall nuts have been soaked has potent medicinal properties. But Mp says that any urine counts, "for just as a golden-colored body is called a foul body, so even fresh urine is called putrid urine." 676 Disa na patihannati. Lit. "The region [or quarter] is not hindered." But disa may be a truncated instrumental, with patihannati refer­ ring to the monk. Thus "he is not hindered by [or 'in'] any quarter." 677 Reading with Ce bhikkhuno, as against Be and Ee sikkhato, "one in training." 678 This is one of the most popular discourses in the Theravada tra­ dition. Tn Sri Lanka, during the Anuradhapura period, it was often used as the topic for long sermons crowning a festival; see Rahula l956: 268-73. Mp explains "noble lineages" (ariyavamsa) as the lineages of the noble ones: all Buddhas, paccekabuddhas, and the Buddha's disciples. 679 . Mp explains contentment with each requisite by way of the three kinds of contentment. See p. 1600, note 55. 680 Mp: ' Finds delight in development (bhavanaramo): He delights in developing the four establishments of mindfulness, the four right strivings, the four bases for psychic potency, the five facul­ ties, the five powers, the seven enlightenment factors, the seven contemplations, the eighteen great insights, the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment, and the thirty-eight meditation objects. Finds delight in abandoning (pahanaramo): He delights in abandoning the defilements of sensual desire and so forth." 681 Reading with Be and Ee dhiram. Ce has viram in padas a and b, but dhlro in padas c and d. 682 Mp says that pada b explains pada a. Because discontent is unable to vanquish the steadfast one, cannot overcome him, therefore discontent does not vanquish the steadfast one. 683 Dhammapadani. Mp: "Portions of Dhamma" (dhammakotthasa). .684 See p. 1646, note 416. 685 These two wanderers are also mentioned at MN 117.37, III 78,13, and SN 22:62, III 73,3. We do not have more information about them than what is said here. 686 Three of the four "wheels" (cakkani) are mentioned at Sn 260. The fourth, "relying on good persons," corresponds to "associating with tKe wise" (panditananca sevana) at Sn 259. 687 The word sangaha literally means "inclusion, bringing together, holding together," from prefix sam + gaha, "hold, grasp." The verb from which the noun is derived is sahganhati, from sam, "together," andganhati, "to grasp, to hold." The four sangahavatthu

###### The four in Pali are dana, peyyavajja, atthacariya, samanattata. To adequately capture the dual nuance of sangaha two words might have been used, "attract and sustain." PED explains sangaha, in the relevant sense, as "kindliness, sympathy, friendliness, assistance, protection, favour," and takes sangahavatthu to mean "objects (characteristics) of sympathy." SED defines the Skt form samgrahavastu as "element of popularity," and BHSD as "article of attraction, means by which a Buddha or (more often in BHS) a Bodhisattva attracts, draws to himself and to religious life, crea­ tures." Although the four figure .prominently in.the Mahayana sutras, they are already found in the archaic Nikayas. Mp: "Some people are to be sustained by a gift, so a gift should be given to them. Others expect endearing speech, so they should be addressed with pleasant words. Beneficent conduct is a talk on increasing goodness; these people should be told, 'You should do this, you shouldn't do that. You should associate.with this person, not with that person.' Impartiality is.being the same in happiness and suffering: This means sitting together with them, living together, and eating together." In Skt versions of. the four factors the fourth is often samdnartha (which would be Pali samanattha), "having a common purpose" or "having shared benefits." 688 "Personal existence" (sakkaya): the five aggregates subject to clinging. See MN 44.2,1 299,s-w; SN 22:105; III 158,3-4. 689. Mp: '"For the most part' (yebhuyyena) is said to make an excep­ tion of those devas who are noble disciples. Though they experi­ ence urgency of knowledge (nanasamvega), no fear at all arises in the arahants, because they have attained what should be attained through careful striving. The other devas, as they attend to imper­ manence, experience both fear as mental fright (cittutrasabhaya) and, at the time of strong insight, cognitive fear (nanabhaya)." "Cognitive fear" is probably the stage of insight called "knowl­ edge of appearance as fearful" (bhayat'upatthanaRana; see Vism 645-47, Ppn 21.29-34). 690 Mp: "Included in personal existence (sakkdyapariyapannd): included in the five aggregates. Thus, when the Buddha teaches them the Dhamma stamped with the three characteristics, exposing the faults in the round of existence, cognitive fear enters them." 691 Yavata bhikkhave dhamma sankhata va asankhata va. In the Nikayas, the only dhamma explicitly said to be unconditioned is nibbana. All other dhammas, mental and material, are conditioned. Thus the best of conditioned dhammas is the noble eightfold path, which leads to the unconditioned.

 gift or the item to be given: "A giver to the foremost-, a giver to the Three Jewels, which are foremost; or one who generates merit by making a lofty gift of a foremost item" (aggassa ratanattayassa data, atha vd aggassa deyyadhaimnassa danam uldram katva tattha punnam pavatteta). 693 Mp says that the noble method (ariyandya) is the path together with insight, and the "goodness of the Dhamma" (kalydnadhammata) and "the wholesomeness of the Dhamma" (kusaladhammata) are names for it. 694 Seep. 1647, note 428. 695 This is one of the thirty-two. marks of a great person, said to be the karmic consequence of living for the happiness of many, dis­ pelling fear and terror, providing lawful protection and shelter, and supplying all necessities. See DN 30.1.7, 111 147—49. 696 Mp interprets the conversation on both sides as referring to the future: the brahmin asks about the Buddha's future rebirth and the latter replies with respect to his future rebirth. As I read the exchange, however, a subtle word play is involved. The brah­ min uses the future bhavissati as a polite way of inquiring about the present, which I render "could you be?" (Bhavissanti is used above in just this way, negatively, in the sentence, na vat'imani manussabhutassa padani bhavissanti, "These could not be....") But the Buddha uses the future form literally and thus in each case answers, "I will not be" (na bhavissanti), referring to his destiny in a future life. Two Chinese parallels, SA 101 (at TII 28ai9-28bi7) and EA 38.3 (at T II 717ci8—718ai2), render this entire conversa­ tion as pertaining to the present. The brahmin asks the Buddha whether he is (,&) a deva, a naga, etc., a human being, or a non- human being, and the Buddha simply denies (IF-) that he is any . of these. There is no reference to the future. 697 Gandhabbas are celestial beings sometimes depicted as the musi­ cians of the devas. Yakkhas are fierce spirits noted for their destructiveness. 698 The verb abbaje here is optative of abbaja ti (Skt dvrajati). See DOP sv abbajati. I 699 Mp: "At the end of the discourse, the brahmin attained three paths and fruits and, in 12,000 phrases, spoke the praise called 'Dona's Thunder.' When a great commotion erupted after the Buddha's passing, he settled it and distributed the relics" (at DN 16.6.25, II166). 700 That is, I shall terminate the old discomfort of hunger without creating fresh discomfort by eating to excess. 701 I take dhammam here to represent Skt dhamman, the plural accusa­

 703 Patilino. Mp glosses with "hidden, gone into Solitude" (nilino cklhhavam upagato). 704 Panunnapaccekasacco. Mp glosses as "view-truths (ditthisaccani) called personal7 because each one holds to them individually, insisting 'This alone is truth, this alone is truth/" 705 Reading with Be sabbani nunnani honti panunnani honti cattani vantani miittani pahinani, patinissatthani. This is also the Ce and Ee reading of the same passage in 10:20. 706 Mp: "The search for a spiritual life (brahmacariyesana) consists in the aspiration that occurs thus, 'I will seek out, search for, a spiritual life/ This subsides and is tranquilized by the path of arahantship. But the search for a spiritual life in the form of views (ditthibrahmacariyesana) subsides with the path of stream- entry." 707 Bodily activity (kayasankhara) is elsewhere identified with in-and- out breathing, which ceases in the fourth jhana. See 9:31 §4. Also see MN 44.15; 1301,19-21; SN 41:6,1V. 293,16-17.. 708 M p :"The tight grasp 'Such is the truth' (iti saccaparamaso) is the grasping of such conceptions as 'Such is the truth, such is the truth/ Viewpoints (ditthitthana) are simply views, called 'swell­ ings7 (samussaya) because of their swelling up (samussitatta), because they rise up and persist." 709 Niccadanam anukulayannam. Mp explains anukulayannam as a sac­ rifice that should be made to maintain the family custom, on the grounds that it was given by one's father and grandfather and so forth. On niccadanam anukulayannam as superior to animal sacrifice, see especially DN 5.22-23,1144, which can be regarded almost as an elaboration of the present sutta. 710 My division into four sections is speculative. Apart from this, I do not see any other basis for including this sutta among the Fours. 711 These were Vedic sacrifices. 712 I follow Ce and Be, which put niraggalam in pada b and include mahayanna in pada c. Ee lacks mahayanna, but two Chinese paral­ lels include a compound corresponding to this word: SA 89 (at T II 22cw) has A # , more literally "great gathering," and SA2 89 (at T II 404b4) has where means "to sacrifice to the gods or ancestors." Mp explains maharambha: "With great tasks, great works; further, they are of 'great violence' because of the extent of the destruction of life." 713 Readings of this enigmatic term vary here and elsewhere across the Nikayas. Here, Ce has vivattacchadda, Be vivatacchada, Ee vivattacchada. The expression often occurs in the stock passage on

 king, but if he goes forth into homelessness, he will become a perfectly enlightened Buddha, described as "one in the world who vivatacchado" (variants: viuaptacchado, viuattacchaddo, vivat- tacchaddo). See e.g. DN 3.1.5, I 89,8-9; DN 14.1.31, II 16,8-9; DN 30.1.1, III 142,4; MN 91.5, II 134,28; Sn 106. Though the origins of the term and its exact meaning are problematic, the commentar­ ies consistently analyze and explain it in the same way. Since Mp (on the present sutta) does not offer an explanation, I cite the Dlgha Nikaya commentary, Sv 1250,34—251,3: "Vivattacchado: Here, having been born into the world, he dwells having entirely removed the covering in the world (loke tam chadanam vivattetva), in the darkness of defilements covered by seven coverings (chadanehi): lust, hatred, delusion, conceit, views, ignorance, and misconduct." The old canonical commentary, Culaniddesa, commenting on Sn 1147, says: "Viuatacchado: There are five coverings (chadanani): craving, views, defilements, misconduct, ignorance. Those cov­ erings have been removed (vivatarii) by the Blessed Buddha; they have been dispelled, uprooted, abandoned, eradicated, settled, stilled, burned by the fire of knowledge so that they are unable to arise. Therefore the Buddha is one who has removed the cover­ ings" (Nidd II 251,18-22; VRIed. 204). Norman (1991: 71-76) had proposed that the Pali expres­ sion was to be derived from the BITS form vighustasabda and thus meant "one whose name (or fame) had rolled in different directions"or "one of widespread fame." In a later work (2Q06b: 228-29) he changed his position, stating: "although I was correct to see a connection between the Pali and Skt words, the direction of the development was in the reverse order, and must represent a hyper-Sanskritisation from vivattacchadda." At Sn 372 and else­ where he renders this "with deceit removed." The Chinese translators of the Agamas must have worked with texts that read vighustasabda or some variant with the same meaning. Thus a parallel of 4:40, SA2 90 (at T II 404c6) has ^ 5s%, "whose name is heard extremely far away." The parallel of DN 30, MA 59 (at T 1493b7-^), reads: "he necessarily becomes a Tathagata, unattached (= arahant), fully enlightened, whose name spreads around and is heard in the ten directions." MA 161, the parallel of MN 91, has the same at T I 685b2-^. Though various conjectures might be proposed with respect to the original expression and its meaning, given the difficulty of settling these questions across Buddhist textual traditions, the most expedient course open to me is to translate

 714 The readings here vary considerably. Ce and Be have vitivatta. kulam gatim, "who have transcended family and destination." Ee has a bahubblhi compound, vTtivcittakalamgati, with still more variants in the notes. Mp (Be) reads kulam gatim in the lemma, but Mp (Ce) has kalam gatim. My rendering follows Ee. Note that in 5:55, at III 69,io, kalam and. gatim are in immediate proximity, which supports the hypothesis that here too we should read kala-/kalam. 715 I read with Be yannassa kovida, as against Ge and Ee punnassa kovida, "proficient in merit." Mp (Be) and Mp (Ce) show the same difference in their lemmas and glosses. Two Chinese parallels correspond to Be. SA'90 (atT II 23an) has "the Bud­ dha who is skilled in sacrifice," and SA2 90 (at T II 404cs) ?/this is the good sacrifice and the path of sacrifice praised by the Buddhas." 716 The Pali reads at thi bhikkhave samadhibhavana bhavita bahullkata ditthadhammasukhaviharaya samvattati, lit., "there is, bhikkhus, . a development of concentration, that, when developed and cultivated, leads to dwelling happily in this very life." Since in English "when developed and cultivated" would be redun­ dant, I have omitted it in favor of more natural English diction. The same applies to each of the other three developments of concentration. 717 Evidently, this refers to the attainment of the jhanas either by one who does not use them to develop insight, or by an ara­ hant, who enters the jhanas simply to dwell at ease. Elsewhere the jhanas are shown to lead to the destruction of the taints. Ce has vuccati in this section but not in the parallel sentences of the next three sections. Ee is just the opposite, omitting vuccati here but including it in the next three sections. Be omits vuccati in all four sections. 718 Mp explains "knowledge and vision" in this context as the divine eye (dibbacakkhunanadassanassa patilabhaya). Elsewhere it is used to mean insight knowledge or even full enlightenment. 719 Yatha diva tatha rattim, yatha rattim tatha diva. Mp: "As he attends to the perception of light by day, so he attends to it at night; and so in reverse." 720 Mp: "How are feelings known as they arise, etc.? Here, a bhik­ khu comprehends the base (vatthu, the sense organ) and the object (arammana). By comprehending the base and the object, he knows: 'Thus those feelings have arisen; thus they stand; thus they cease.' The same method applies to perceptions and thoughts."

 723 Also at SN 2:26,1 61-62. 724 Dalhadhamma. The suffix -dhamma here is a Pali formation, of Skt dhanvan, "having a bow." Hence the gloss by Mp: " Firm-bowed means possessing a bow of the maximum size" (dalhadhanu uttamappamanena dhanuna samannagato). 725 Dhanuggaho sikkhito katahcittho katupasano. Mp explains dhanug- gaho as a teacher of archery, sikkhito as one who has trained in archery for twelve years, katahattho as one skillful enough to split the tip of a hair even at the distance of an usabha, and katupasano as one experienced in shooting arrows who has exhibited his craft. See too p. 1831, note 1935; also see CDB 393, note 181,.and CDB 819, note 365. 726 Mp: "The teaching of the good is the thirty-seven aids to enlight­ enment. The teaching of the bad is the sixty-two speculative views." 727 The sutta is also found at SN 21:7, II 280. No fourfold scheme is apparent, and thus I cannot determine the reason for including it in the Fours. 728 I read with Be and Ee nabhasamanam jananti, as against Ce na bhasamanam jananti. The context clearly requires the former. The Chinese parallel SA 1069 (at T II 277ci2) supports this with l a " I f he does not speak the Dhamma." 729 Sannavipallaso, cittavipallaso, ditthivipallaso. Vipallasa is from vi + pari + asa, "turned upside down." These are treated in terms of abandonment and non-abandonment at Patis II 80-81. 730 I read with Ce and Be dukkhe bhikkhave sukhan ti sannavipallaso, as against Ee adukkhe bhikkhave dukkhan ti sannavipallaso. 731 I read with Ce and Ee micchaditthigata, as against Be micchaditthi- hata. But I follow the verse divisions of Be rather than of Ce. 732 Mp glosses mahika with himam, "snow," but PED offers "fog, frost," which seem better. 733 Of the four upakkilesas, the drinking of liquor by bhikkhus is prohibited by Pac-ittiya 51; sexual intercourse by Parajika 1; the acceptance of gold and silver (as well as of any other medium of monetary exchange) by Nissaggiya-pacittiya 18. Various kinds of wrong livelihood prohibited to Buddhist monastics are enumer­ ated at DN 2.1.21-27,1 67-69. See too MN 117.29, III 75,u-u. 734 I read with Be asuddha saraja maga. 735 Here, the four streams of merit are explained in terms of the four requisites: robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines. Mp appar- entty misses the correct derivation of sovaggika, deriving it from sutthu agganam rupadinam dayaka. The word is properly derived from sagga (Skt svarga), heaven. But Mp to 4:61 gives the correct

 736 Appamanam cetosamadhim. Mp: "'The concentration of the fruit of arahantship" (arahattaphalasamadhi). 737 Also at SN 55:31, V 391, without verses, and at SN 55:41, V 399— 400, with the same verses as those of 4:51. 738 These verses are also at SN 11:14,1 232; SN 55:26, V 384; and SN 55:51, V 405. 739 Chava, lit. a corpse. Mp: "Such a person is called a corpse because he or she is dead through the death of their virtuous qualities." 740 On Nakulapita and Nakulamata, see 1:257,1:266, 6:16. 741 At 1:263 she is designated the foremost among givers of what is . excellent. - . ; . 742 Mp identifies the "world-knowers" (lokaviduna) with the Buddhas. 743 Ee is somewhat misleading here. First, if punctuates wrongly, and then it adds an extra paccupatthito hoti at the end. The punc­ tuation in Ce and Be indicates that the indirect object (the item given) belongs with the preceding paccupatthito, and they both lack paccupatthito hoti at the end. Thus in Ce and Be there is no separate phrase indicating that the lay disciple simply serves the Sahgha without mention of an item presented. r44 Saha natihi saha upajjhayehi. In Buddhist monastic culture, the upajjhaya is the senior monk who presides over one's ordina­ tion. Thus the use of the word here, in a non-monastic context, is unusual. Mp explains the word in this passage as if it means friends, "because one's friends should be concerned about, one's happiness and suffering (sukhadukkhesu upanijjhayitabbatta)," but this explanation depends on an unconvincing word play. Upajjhaya is not connected to the verb upanijjhayati (Skt upanidhyayati), "to think of, to consider," but to ajjheti (Skt adh- yeti), "to study, to learn from (a teacher)." 745 Ce and Ee apathadaso; Be apatadaso. Mp (Ce): "He sees whatever comes into range, even a subtle matter that comes into range" (tam tarn attham apatheti tameva passati, sukhumampissa atthnjatam apatham agacchatiyeva ti attho). 746 Here Mp correctly derives sovaggika from sagga: Saggassa hita ti tatr’upapattijananato sovaggika. 747 I have divided this verse and the next in line with the correspond­ ing verses of 5:51. Since Ce was edited by different editors who apparently did not collaborate, the same sets of verses in dif­ ferent volumes are sometimes divided differently. The division used at 5:51, which groups together the several applications of wealth, seems to correspond better to the sense. 748 In Pali: atthisukha bhogasukha ananasukha anavajjasukha Mp: "The

The first three types make up one portion, the happiness of blame­ lessness is a portion in its own right. Then he sees with wisdom and knows that the former three types of happiness combined are not worth a sixteenth part of the happiness of blamelessness." 752 An expanded parallel of 3:31. Another parallel is. It 106, 109-11. 753 A separate sutta number is missing in Ee, which thus gives the. impression that this sutta is a continuation of the preceding one. 754 The first, it seems, are those who place confidence in a spiri­ tual teacher because of his impressive physical form (rupa), i.e., his beauty. The second are those whose confidence is based on impressive speech {ghosa, perhaps "voice," a soothing and melodious voice); the third, those whose confidence is based on a teacher's austerity (lukha; Mp gives as examples using a coarse robe and alms bowl); and the fourth, those who place confidence in a teacher because of his teaching (dhamma). Mp says that one out of 100,000 people base their confidence on the teacher's Dhamma. 755 Reading with Be nabhijananti te jana. 756 Reading with Ce mohena adhama. satta, as against Be mohena avutd satta. Ee mohena adhamasatta is the same in meaning as Ce. 757 I read the second couplet with Be and Ee yathadhamma tathasantd/ na tass'evan ti mannare. Ce reads pada d: nassevanti na mannare. Mp: "In accordance with their own natures: They are of such a nature that qualities like lust, etc., remain; having become of such a nature. [They] do not think of it in such a way: They do not think of it thus: 'We exist in such a way, we have such a nature'" (yathadhamma tathasanta ti yatha ragadayo dhamma thita, tatha sabhava'va hutva; na tass'evan ti mannare ti mayarn evamsanta evamsabhava ti tassa na mannare, na mannantl ti attho). 758 The incident is also recorded at Vin II 109-10. 759 Imani cattari ahirajakuldni.

This is an asseveration of truth (saccakiriya) and, as such belongs with the verses but since no meter is apparent

 recited by forest monks as a safeguard against snakebites. It is often incorporated into their daily recitation. 761 The sutta, including the verse, is also at SN 17:35, II 241, with an added homily on the danger of gain, honor, and praise. See too Vin II187-88. 762 I cannot clearly see a reason for including this sutta in the Fours. I can only conjecture that the explanation lies in the four groups of people who swerve from righteousness: kings, royal vassals, brahmins and householders, and the people of the town and countryside. But this omits the natural phenomena, which also have a claim to be included. 763 Adhammika honti. Mp: "Without performing the tenfold oblatiOn prescribed by the ancient kings, and without assigning punish­ ment in proportion to the crime, they peirform excessive obla­ tions and assign excessive punishments.". The tenfold oblation (dasabhagabali) is mentioned only here. 764 In support of my translation of brahmanagahapatika as. a dvanda compound, rather than as a kammadharaya, "brahmin house-

Thapetva brahmane ye keci agaram ajjhavasanta idha gahapatika ti veditabba. 765 The omission of dubbala in the VRI edition appears to be an error. The other editions, including the Be printed version, have this word. 766 See 3:16. 767 Right view (sammaditthi) is the first factor of the noble eightfold path/and the three types of wholesome thought are collectively right intention (sammasankappa), the second path factor. 768 Ee treats this as the beginning of a new sutta, numbered 4:74, whereas Ce and Be consider this part of 4:73. Mp supports Ce and Be, stating that the simile is brought in to give an example of the bad person's character. 769 Ee treats 4:74 and 4:75 as a single sutta, as against Ce and Be, which take them to be different. 770 What occurs from this point on is also in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta, DN 16.6.5, II 154-55. 771 Acinteyyani.

 as: 'Who made the sun and moon? Who made the earth and the ocean? Who created sentient beings? Who made the mountains, mangoes, palmyras, and coconuts?'" 773 Also at MN 142.9-13, III 256-57. 774 Mp: "They do not sit in council (n'eva sabhayam nisidati) in the judgment hall for the purpose of passing judgment. They do not engage in business (na kammantam payojeti), in major work such as agriculture, trade, and so forth. They do not go to Kamboja (na kambojam gacchati): they do not go to the Kamboja country for the purpose of carrying goods. This is the mere heading. The sense is that they do not go to any remote country." . . 775 The sutta, accompanied by.similes and verses, is at SN 3:21, I 93-96; see too Pp 51-52. Mp: "One is in darkness (tamo) because one is conjoined with darkness by being reborn in a low family, and one is heading tozuard darkness (tamoparayana) because one is approaching the darkness of hell through bodily misconduct, etc. One is m light (joti) because one is conjoined with light by being reborn in a high family, and one is heading toward light (jotipara.ya.na) because one is approaching the light of a heavenly rebirth through bodily good conduct, etc." 776 See 3:13.1 read with Ce and Be venakule va nesadakule, as against Ee nesadakule va venakule. 777 Ce defines these four types with exactly the same explanations given in 4:85. Be and Ee, however, offer no explanations but merely give the headings. 778 Mp resolves samanamacalo into samana-acalo, with —m— a mere conjunct consonant. It identifies this figure with the seven kinds of trainees (sattavidhampi sekham dasseti). On the next two ascetics, Mp says: "The white-lotus ascetic (samanapundarlka) is an ascetic similar to a white lotus (pundarika), which has fewer than a hundred petals. By this he shows the dry-insight arahant (sukkhavipassakakhinasavam dasseti), called a white-lotus ascetic because his virtues are incomplete, since he lacks the jhanas and direct knowledges. The red-lotus ascetic (samanapaduma) is an ascetic similar to a red lotus (paduma), which has a full hundred petals. By this he shows the arahant liberated in both respects (ubhatobhagavimuttam khlnasavam dasseti), called a red-lotus ascetic because his virtues are complete, since he possesses the jhanas and direct knowledges." On the colors of the two kinds of lotus flowers, pundarika and paduma, see p. 1642, note 389. "The delicate ascetic among ascetics" (samanesu samanasukhumSlo) is "one with soft mind and body, who experiences exclusively pleasure, free from bodily and mental pain" (muducittasariro

 779 Mp: " M acalappatto ti raffno khnttiyassa muddhavasittassa putfa- bhavena ceva put.tesu jetthakabhavena ca na tava abhisittabhavena ca abhisekappatti-atthdya acalappatto niccalapatto." The gist is that the eldest son is said to have "attained the unshaken" since he is destined to be a head-anointed king. See too p. 1636, note 345 780 Anuttaram. yogakkhemam patthayamano viharati, Mp: "He dwells aspiring for arahantship/' 781 Contrary to Mp, the definition of the white-lotus ascetic here is ambiguous; for the expression "he does not dwell having contacted with the body the eight emancipations" (no ca kho attha. vimokkhe . kayena phusitva viharati) could mean either: (1) that he does not attain any of the eight emancipations, which would make him a dry-insight arahant (as Mp asser ts); or (2) that he attains some of the eight emancipations but not all, perhaps the three emancipations based on form but not the formless attainments and cessation. In such a case, the meditator would conform to the definition of the arahant liberated by wisdom (pannavimutta) of whom it is said that ' he has eliminated the taints but does not attain the peaceful form­ less attainments (MN 70.16,1 477,33—478,i). The commentators hold that the pannavimutta arahant can possess any number among the four jhanas or no jhana at all; only the latter is a dry-insight arahant. The dry-insight arahant (sukkhavipassakakhinasava) is not explicitly mentioned as such in the Nikayas but first gains recogni­ tion in the commentaries. In any case, the difference in the defini­ tions between the wisdom-liberated arahant and the white-lotus arahant suggests that at some point a shift had taken place in the scale of meditative attainments that was expected of an arahant. While the arahant liberated by wisdom lacks only the formless attainments, the white-lotus arahant, on the interpretation offered by the commentators, lacks the jhanas as well. The eight emancipations (attha vimokkha), defined at 8:66, are not exactly identical with the four jhanas and four formless attainments. It seems that the first three emancipations corre­ spond to the four jhanas but distinguish them in terms of objects rather than mental factors. 782 Again, there is an ambiguity in the definition of the red-lotus. ascetic. To qualify as such, does one have to possess all eight emancipations or is it sufficient to possess several? Given the commentarial explanation, which compares the red -lotus ascetic to a lotus with a full hundred petals, it seems that one would have to possess all eight emancipations. But the commentarial definition of the ubhatobhagavimutta arahant allows one who pos­ sesses any of the formless attainments to count as "one liberated

###### stringent criterion that would restrict the designation to an ara­ hant possessing all eight emancipations. 783 More literally, "the robe he uses is usually one that he has been asked to accept, seldom one that he has not been asked to accept." And so with the other three requisites. 784 In commenting on sannipatikani, Mp-t says "produced by a combination of the three’—bile and so forth—which are out of balance" (pittadlnam tinnampi visamanam sannipatena jatani). Spk III 81 ,22-23, commenting on the same word at SN IV 230,29, says "originating through a disturbance of the three, bile and so forth" (tinnampi pittadlnam kopena samutthitdni). 785 The eight causes of feelings are also at SN 36:21, IV 230-31. • 786 Mp says that the first section describes the seven kinds of train­ ees; the second, the dry-insight arahant; the third, the arahant liberated in both respects; and the fourth, the Tathagata and an arahant similar to the Tathagata. 787 Mp: "Internal serenity of mind (ajjhattam cetosamatha) is internal concentration of mind at the level of absorption (niyakajjhatte appanacittasamadhi). Higher wisdom of insight into phenomena (adhipannadhammavipassana) is the insight knowledge that com­ prehends conditioned phenomena (sankharapariggahakavipassana- nana). This is the higher wisdom that consists of insight into phenomena, that is, into the five aggregates." 788 Mp: "Conditioned phenomena should be seen as impermanent, explored as impermanent, and discerned with insight as imper­ manent; and so too as suffering and as non-self." 789 Mp: "The mind should be steadied, composed, unified, and con­ centrated by way of the first jhana; and so too for the second and higher jhanas." 790 He repeats all four types, as does the Buddha below. I have omit­ ted the repetition. 791 Abhikkanta h'esa potaliya yadidam tattha tattha kalanhuta. Mp: "It is the nature of the wise, when they have known it is the proper time, to speak dispraise of one who deserves dispraise and to speak praise of one who deserves praise." 792 These are the nine divisions'of the Buddha's teachings. See p. 1678, note 631. 793 Ee ends 4:104 here, taking this much to be a complete sutta, and then repeats these sentences as the opening of 4:105, followed by the exposition. Thus Ee's 4:105 is identical with my 4:104. Ee reads the uddana verse to indicate there are two "pools of water" suttas, but the manuscripts have only one. In the verse dve honti can be read with either udakarahada or ambani. Ce and Be, which 1

 follow, choose the latter and thus have only one "pools of water" sutta, 4:104, with 4:106 left blank. 794 I read with Ce and Be kim nu, as against Ee kathan nu. 7 95 Pahitatto kdyena c'eva paramasaccam sacchikaroti, panndya ca ativijjha passati. Mp explains "body" as the mental body (namakayena), the supreme truth as nibbana, and wisdom as the wisdom of the path together with insight. 796 The Pali word thana can mean place, possibility, occasion, situ­ ation, cause, case, etc. Mp glosses it with karana. To convey the appropriate meaning, I here render it sometimes as "case of a deed" and sometimes simply as "deed." . 797 So na bhayati samparayikassa maranassa. Mp: "Arahants do not fear death either in the future or in this present life. They alone are intended here. Some, however, say that because of the statement, 'developed right view /all noble ones from the stream-entereir up are intended." I am not sure that samparayikassa maranassa means death in a future life, as Mp implicitly understands it. I take it to mean simply "death in the future," referring primarily to one's future in this present life. 798 Attarupena. Mp glosses: "What is in conformity with oneself, what is suitable, meaning one who desires his welfare" (attano anurupena anucchavikena, hitak&mena ti attho). 799 We find three kinds of intoxication (mada) at 3:39: with youth, health, and life. Vibh 345 (Be §832) mentions still more objects of intoxication: birth, clan, gains, honor, respect, wealth, beauty, learning, etc. The elaboration at Vibh 350 (Be §§843-45) connects mada with mana, meaning conceit, and unnati, meaning self­ promotion. 800 Na ca pana samanavacanahetupi gacchati. Mp: "He is not swayed by the words of ascetics holding other doctrines to abandon his own view and take up their view. Here, too, only arahants are intended." 801 Also in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta, DN 16.5.8, I I 140-41. The word here translated "inspiring," samvejaniya, is glossed by Mp as samvegajariaka. In this context, the rendering "inspiring a sense of urgency" does not fit. The required sense, rather, is that which inspires faith and devotion. 802 The four places, respectively, are: Lumbini, Bodhgaya, Isipatana (Samath), and Kusinara. 803 What follows is also at 2:1. 804 What follows parallels the passage on "the fault pertaining to the future life" in 2:1, but it describes this simply as "a bad result" (pdpako vipako) where 2:1 has "a bad, painful result" (papako duk-

 originally a commentator's gloss on papako that made its way into the text of 2:1 itself. 805 Mp: "Among these perils, (1) for one who reflects on the peril in self-reproach, a sense of moral shame is established inwardly. This produces in him restraint in the three doors, and such restraint is the fourfold purified virtuous behavior. Based on this virtuous behavior, he develops insight and attains the highest fruit. (2) For one who reflects on the peril of reproach by others, moral dread is established with respect to the external. This pro­ duces in him restraint in the three doors, and such restraint is the fourfold purified virtuous behavior. Based on this virtuous behavior, he develops insight and attains the highest fruit. (4) For one who reflects on the peril of a bad destination, a sense of shame is established with respect to the external. This pro­ duces in him restraint1 in the three doors, and such restraint is the fourfold purified virtuous behavior. Based on this virtuous behavior, he develops insight and attains the highest fruit." The third case does not lead directly to the highest fruit but merely to abstinence from breaches of the five precepts. 806 Also at MN 67.14-20,1459-62. 807 Pali recognizes two classesof food items: khadanlya and bhojamya. The latter comprises rice, porridge, other grains, fish, and meat; the former comprises virtually all other edibles. Hence, corre­ sponding to these two types of foods, two gerundives are used here to designate what may be eaten: khaditabba and bhunjitabba, which I render, respectively, "things that may be consumed" and "things that may be eaten." 808 Mp: "The first jhana may be of an inferior grade, a middling grade, and a superior grade. For those reborn through an inferior grade, the life span is a third of an eon; for those reborn through the middling grade, the life span is half an eon; and for those reborn through a superior grade, the life span is an eon. This is said with reference to the last." For details on the life spans in the various realms according to the developed Theravada model, see Vibh 422-26 (Be §§1022-28); CZMA 196-99. 809 Mp: "He 'goes to hell' in some subsequent life, insofar as he has not abandoned kamma that leads to hell; not in the sense that he goes there in his immediately following life." According to the Abhidhamma, one passing away from the form realm does not immediately take rebirth in one of the three lower realms; see CMA 226-27. 810 Tasmirityeva bhave parinibbayati. Mp: "He attains final nibbana

 812 The devas of streaming radiance (deva abhassara) are the highest class of devas associated with the second jhana. Mp; "The second jhana is threefold, as stated above [for the first jhana]. For those reborn by a superior grade, the. life span is eight eons; by a mid­ dling grade, four eons; and by an inferior grade, two eons. The text refers to the last/' 813 The devas of refulgent glory (deva subhakinha) are the highest class of devas associated with the third jhana. According to the Abhidhamma system, the life spans of the three planes corre­ sponding to the third jhana are respectively sixteen, thirty-two, and sixty-four eons. Since this is contradicted by the sutta, Mp explains that what is intended here is the lowest plane among those planes reached by rebirth through attainment of the third jhana. However, according to Mp, the devas of refulgent glory are actually the highest among these realms, with a life span of sixty-four eons. There thus seems to be a contradiction between the sutta and the systematic .Theravada determination of life spans. 814 These are the deva vehapphald, the sole realm of rebirth corre­ sponding to the mundane fourth jhana. This figure is .in agree­ ment with the stipulation of the Abhidhamma. 815 Te dhamme aniccato dukkhato rogato gandato sallato aghato abadhato parato palokato sunnato anattato samanupassati. Mp: "Of these eleven terms, two— impermanent and disintegrating—signify the characteristic of impermanence. Two— empty and non-self— signify the characteristic of non-self. The rest signify the charac­ teristic of suffering. By ascribing the three characteristics to the five aggregates and seeing them thus, he achieves three paths and fruits. Having developed the fourth jhana, firm in it, 'he is reborn in companionship with the devas of the pure abodes/" 816 The pure abodes (suddhavasa) are five planes of existence in the form realm into which only non-returners can be reborn. Non­ returners attain arahantship there without ever returning to lower realms. See CMA 192-93. 817 In this sutta, loving-kindness is correlated with the first jhana, compassion with the second, altruistic joy with the third, and equanimity with the fourth. According to the developed Theravada system, however, any of the first three immeasurable meditations can lead to all three jhanas, excluding the fourth; only immeasurable equanimity can lead to the fourth jhana.

Through what kamma have those beings been reborn in the world-interval hell? They arise there because they have committed terrible crimes against their parents and against righteous ascetics and brahmins, and through other violent deeds such as killing living beings day after day.... Their bodies are three gavutas long(appx. five miles) and they have long fingernails like bats. As bats hang in trees, these beings hang by their fingernails on the foot of the world-system mountain. When creeping along, they stay in arm's length of one another. Then, thinking, 'We have gained food/ they bustle around, roll over, and fall into the water that supports the world; they are just like honey fruits which, when struck by the wind, break off and fall into the water. As soon as they have fallen, they dissolve like a lump of flour in extremely caustic w ater.... This radiance [when the bodhisatta enters his mother's womb] does not even last long enough to fake a sip of porridge, but only long enough for them to awaken from sleep and cognize the object. But the Dlgha Nikaya reciters say that, like a flash of lightning, it shows forth merely for the time of a finger snap and disappears even while they are saying, 'What is that?'" 821 Alaya. Mp explains this narrowly as the five objects of sensual pleasure, or more broadly, as the entire round of samsara. 822 Analaye dhamme. Mp: ''The noble Dhamma opposed to attach­ ment, based on the ending of the round." . 823 Anupasama. Lit., "lack of peace." 824 Avijjagata, bhikkhave, paja andabhuia pariyonaddha. This is the read­ ing in Ce and Be, but Ee has andhabhuta, "become blind/' The latter, at first glance, seems more likely to have been original, but the simile of the hen at 8:11,TV 176,15-16 supports andabhilta, "become an egg/' Mp too accepts this reading with its gloss, "being enveloped by the shell, of ignorance, it has become like an egg" (avijjandakosena pariyonaddhatta andam viya bhuta ti andabhuta). 825 Also at DN-16.5.16, II 145^6. 826 In Pali, the three kinds of fetters are, respectively: orambhagiyftni samyojanani, upapattipatilabhiyani samyojanani, bhavapatilabhiyani samyojanani.

 (upapattibhavassa patilabhaya paccayani). ApparentJy the differ­ ence, from the commentary's point of view, is that the former bind one only to the immediately following rebirth while the latter bind one to successive rebirths. But see note 829 below for an alternative interpretation. 827 Since the stream-enterer, too, has not abandoned any of these fetters, Mp explains: "The once-returner is mentioned to show the highest among the noble ones who have not abandoned any of the fetters." Mp-t: "'That is, who have not abandoned the lower fetters. For above the once-returner, there is no noble one who has not abandoned the lower fetters. But isn't it the case that once-returners have abandoned [sOme] lower fetters, for they have abandoned the fetters of views, doubt, and wrong grasp of rules and observances? In that case, why is it said that they have not abandoned the lower fetters? Because once-returners have not abandoned the fetters of sensual lust and ill will; therefore the statement that they have not abandoned the lower fetters is said with reference to those fetters that, they have not abandoned. It does not mean that they have not abandoned any fetters." 828 Uddhamsotassa akanitthagamino puggalassa. This refers to the most sluggish of the five classes of non-returners, who proceed upward through successive pure abodes to the highest one, called Akanittha. This type, too, is mentioned to show the coars­ est who still retain the fetters of rebirth, but more acute classes of non-re turners also retain these fetters. 829 This statement creates a predicament for the traditional Theravadin interpretation of the five types of non-returners, which is based on Pp 16-17 and its commen tary at Pp-a 198-201. The core of this interpretation is the rejection of an intermediate state (antarabhava) between two lives. Such rejection thus entails the need to interpret the antaraparinibbayi as a non-returner who attains arahantship during the first half of the life span in the next existence. However, the word antaraparinibbayi literally means "one who attains final nibbana in between," and there seems no legitimate reason, based on a sutta, to deny the possibility that certain non-returners, following their death in human form, enter an intermediate state and attain final nibbana in that state itself, thereby circumventing the need to take another rebirth. This seems to be the purport of the present text, according to which the antaraparinibbayi has abandoned the fetters of rebirth but not the fetters of existence. Upon attaining arahan tship, the antaraparinibbayi will also abandon the fetters of existence. I have discussed the five types of non-returners in detail in CDB 1902-3,

Mp: "When answering a question, he answers correctly (yuttameva), b.ut he does not answer quickly (sigham pana na katheti). The meaning is that he answers slowly. This method [of explanation] should be applied to all the cases." Pp 42 (Be §152) defines this person in the same sense thus: "A person who, being asked a question, speaks cor­ rectly but not quickly is called one whose discernment is incisive but not free-flowing" (idh'ekacco puggalo panham puttho samano yuttam vadati no sigham, ayam .vuccati puggalo yuttappatibhano no muttappatibhano). 831 The four alternatives are: ugghatitannu, vipacitannu (so Ce and Ee; Be vipancitannu), neyyo, padaparamo. The difference in read­ ing of the second person would yield a choice between "one who understands when ripened" (based on Ce and Ee) and "one who understands.when elaborated" (based on Be). Be's reading seems to me to agree better with the formal definition of this type in other sources. 1 cite here the definitions at Pp 41 (Be §§148-51) with commentarial clarifications at Pp-a 223: (1) "The person of quick understanding is one for whom the breakthrough to the Dhamma (dhammabhisamaya) occurs together with an utterance. (Pp-a: Ugghatita means the opening up of knowledge (nanugghatana); the meaning is that one knows as soon as knowl­ edge opens up. Together with an utterance; as soon as [a statement on Dhamma] is uttered. The breakthrough occurs together with knowledge of the Dhamma of the four truths.)" (2) "The person who understands through elaboration is one for whom the break­ through to the Dhamma occurs when the meaning of what has been stated briefly is being analyzed in detaii. (Pp-a: This is the person able to attain arahantship when, after a concise outline of the teaching has been set up, the meaning is being analyzed in detail.)" (3) "The person to be guided is one for whom the break­ through to the Dhamma occurs gradually, through instruction, questioning, careful attention, ^and reliance on good friends." (4) "One for whom the word is the maximum is one who— though hearing much, reciting much, retaining much in mind, and teach­ ing much—does not reach the breakthrough to the Dhamma in that life." Nett 125 (Be §88) correlates these four types with the four kinds of practice (see 4:161-62): the ugghatitannu puggala with one emancipated by pleasant practice and quick direct knowledge, the vipancitannu puggala with one emancipated by either pain­

 and sluggish direct knowledge, and the neyya puggala with one emancipated by painful practice and sluggish direct knowledge. The padaparama puggala is not emancipated and thus the four alternatives do not apply. 832 Mp: " One who lives off the fruit of his effort but not off the fruit of his kamma: This is one who passes the day energetically exerting himself and lives off whatever he gains as the consequential fruit of this, but does not obtain any meritorious fruits as a result of his exertion. One who lives off the fruit of his kamma but not off the fru it of his effort: These are all the devas, from [theheaven of] the four great kings up, who live off their meritorious fruits without energetically exerting themselves. One who lives off the fruit of both his effort and his kamma: These are kings and royal ministers, etc. O ne who lives off the fruit of neither his effort nor his kamma: These are the beings in hell. In this sutta, by 'fruit of kamma/ only meritorious fruit is intended." 833 Mp: "The first is the blind foolish worldling; the second is the worldling who intermittently does wholesome deeds; the third is the stream-enterer, the once-returner, and the non-returner; and the fourth is the arahant." 834 Mp: "The first is the multitude of worldly people; the second is the dry-insight stream-enterer and once-returner; and the third is the non-returner. Since the dry-insight meditator does obtain momentary jhana arisen on the basis of his object (tafikhanikampi upapattinimittakam jhanam patilabhati yeva), he too fulfills concen­ tration. The fourth is the arahant. The following sutta should be understood by the method stated here." 835 On the four analytical knowledges (patisambhida), see below note 875. 836 Here and in the next sutta I read with Ce and Ee samatho, as against Be sammasana. 837 The usual list of faculties (indriya) and powers (bala) is fivefold, with wisdom (panna) as the fifth. For definitions of the five facul­ ties, see SN 48:9-10. For the five powers, see 5:14. 838 Cattari kappassa asankheyyanl. Despite the word "incalculable" (Ce and Ee asankheyya; Be asankhyeyya), the length of this period is finite. For similes illustrating the length of an eon—said to be too difficult to express in numbers— see SN 15:5-6, II 181-82. And for the number of eons that have ''elapsed and gone by," see SN 15:7-8, II182-84. 839 Mp explains that there are three ways the dissolution of an eon takes place: by water, fire, and wind. When the eon is destroyed by fire, it is consumed up to the devas of streaming radiance.

 refulgent glory. When it is destroyed by wind, it disintegrates
 ■ up to the devas of great fruit. 840 Mp: "He is not content with the four requisites by way of the three kinds of contentment." See p. 1600, note 55. 841 Mp says the word "cunningly" (sankhaya, lit. "having calculated") indicates that he tries to make a false impression on families (for the purpose of receiving offerings). The last phrase is perhaps similar in nuance to a well-known English slang expression. 842 Ee reads here: gam bhtresu... thanatthanesu, which might be trans­ lated "various deep matters." It could be that thanatthanesu was the more original reading, which was altered to thanatthanesu under the influence of this more common expression. But since Mp comments as if the latter were the reading, it is clear that thanatthanesu goes back at least to the age of the commentator. At MN 115.12—19, III 64^6.7, the Buddha explains how a bhikkhu is "skilled in what is possible and impossible" (thanathanakusalo). 843 It is puzzling that Ananda goes unaccompanied to visit the bhikkhuni. Almost always when, a bhikkhu goes to’visit a lay­ person, even a male, he brings another monk along. In a Chi­ nese parallel of this sutta/SA 564 (T .II 148ai3-148cio), as Ananda approaches, the bhikkhuni sees him in the distance and exposes her body. When Ananda sees her exposed, he restrains his senses and turns away. The nun then feels ashamed and puts on her clothes. She offers Ananda a seat, pays homage to him, and sits down to one side. Apart from this circumstantial difference, Ananda's discourse in the Chinese version is almost exactly as in the Pali version. 844 Setughato vutto bhagavata. Mp: "The demolition of the bridge (setughatam): the demolition of the state and the demolition of its condition (padaghatam paccayaghatam)." The expression is also in 3:74. See p. 1660, note 497. 845 Mp: "Based on the present nutriment of edible food, using.it . carefully^ he abandons the nutriment consisting in past kamma; but the craving for present edible food should be abandoned." 846 The Chinese version reads: "Sister, by not indulging it, one aban­ dons and severs sexual desire, the connecting bridge (fO'atfiTs#)-" It seems that setughato m ust have been an idiom meaning that any connection with a particular state should be destroyed. Mp says that w hen A nanda reached the end of the discourse, the bhikkhum's passion for him had vanished. 847 Sugata. Lit., "Well-Gone."

 here has an implicitly plural sense; for other examples, see Vin III 159,12, and Vin IV 344,21. 849 Ce is missing the uddcina verse at the end of this vagga. Hence I base the titles on Be. 850 JnPali: dukkha patipada dandhabhinna, dukkha patipada khippabhinna, sukha patipada dandhabhinna, sukha patipada khippabhinna. 851 Anantariyam papunati dsavanam khayaya. The word anantariya is of rare occurrence, so its meaning must be determined inferen- . tially. One clue is the Ratana Sutta, which says: yam buddhasettho parivannayl sucim samadhim anantarikannam ahu (Sn 226). Any dif­ ference between dnantarika and anantariya is insignificant, as the terminations -iya and -ika are often interchangeable. Another clue is SN 22:81, at III 96 -99, where the Buddha addresses the question: "How should one know and see to attain immediately (lit. /without interval') the destruction of the taints?" (evam . . . janato evam passato anantara asavdnam khayo hoti). Other AN .sut­ tas—3:102, I 158,7-12, and 5:23, III 16,29-17,2—speak about the mind being "properly concentrated for the destruction of the taints" (samma samadhiyati asavdnam khayaya). See too.5:170, III 202 ,27-33, which speaks about certain conditions "such that imme­ diately afterward the destruction of the taints oCcurs" (anantara asavdnam khayo hoti). Thus, the "immediacy condition" spoken of here seems to be a state in which the mind is properly concen­ trated and, at the same time, has acquired the insight that brings about the destruction of the taints. Mp explains anantariya with reference to the Abhidhamma concept of an immediate succes­ sion between path and fruit: "The /immediacy condition' is the concentration of the path, which immediately yields its result (anantaravipakadayakam maggasamadhim)." Though the suttas do not employ the scheme of the cognitive process that underlies the concept of path and fruition moments, the expression "imme­ diacy condition" does suggest a state of complete ripeness for the breakthrough to arahantship. 852 The trainee powers (sekhabalani), defined at 5:2, partly differ from the five powers included among the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment. 853 Here, sameti, "calms [it] down," is an addition to the usual for­ mula, intended to subsume this discipline under "the calming practice." 854 Mp says that for Moggallana, the first three paths were achieved by pleasant practice and sluggish direct knowledge, but the path of arahantship was won by pleasant practice and quick direct knowledge. In 7:61 it is seen that Moggallana often had

 often regressed and needed the help of the Buddha to progress further, as shown in SN 40:1-9, IV 262—69- 855 In this sutta the phrase kayassa bheda, "with the breakup of the body/' is not followed by par am marana, "after death," as it nor­ mally is. The omission seems deliberate. Perhaps the purpose is to indicate that the person being described can attain nibbana at the very moment of death, without having to continue on to another existence. 856 According to this sutta, the distinction between the use of repug­ nant objects and the jhanas determines whether one attains nibbana through exertion (sasankharaparinibbayi) or without exertion (asahkharaparinibbayi). The distinction between promi­ nent faculties and feeble faculties determines whether one
 ■ attains nibbana in this very life (ditth'eva dhamme) or with the breakup of the body (kayassa bheda), Mp says that the first and second persons are dry-insight meditators (sukkhavipassaka) who attend to conditioned phenomena as their meditation object (safikharanimittam upatthapehti}. Sasankharena is glossed with sappayogena, which supports my rendering "through exertion." The third and fourth persons are those who take serenity as their vehicle (samathayanika).

**8 5 7 With Ce and Be I read** **_maggehi,_** **as against Ee angehi.** **The latter**
###### is likely to be an editorial error. Though Mp does not provide a gloss here, the passage is cited at Patis II 92,9, and commented on at Patis-a III 5 8 4 ,2 4 -2 5 , in a way that requires maggehi: C atuhi m aggehi ti upari vuccamdnehi catuhi patipadamaggehi, na ariya- maggehi (''By fo u r paths: by the four paths of practice spoken about below, not by the noble paths"). 858 Mp explains this as the first world-transcending path, but Mp-t says: "This is said with reference to the path of stream- entry (sotapattimagga), but the meaning of this passage can be understand simply by way of the mundane [preparatory] path" (lokiyamaggavasen 'eva). 859 Mp and Mp-t, read together, say that because there is no devel­ opment and cultivation of the world-transcending path, which lasts for only one mind-moment, he develops and cultivates the preparatory mundane path (pubbabhagiyo lokiyamaggo) for the purpose of attaining the higher world-transcending paths. Then the fetters are abandoned and the underlying tendencies are uprooted by the successive paths (maggappatipatiya pahTyanti by anti honti). 860 Mp: "This is a person who naturally gains insight. Based on insight, he produces concentration."

 meditative attainment (samapatti), he explores it by way of its conditioned phenomena. And having explored its conditioned phenomena, he enters the next attainment. Thus, having attained the first jhana, he emerges and explores its conditioned phe­ nomena as impermanent, etc. Then he enters the second jhana, emerges, and explores its conditioned phenomena, and so or up to the base of neither-perception-norTnon-perception. Since however, yuganaddha means literally "yoked together," some interpret the term to mean that in this inode pf practice seren­ ity and insight occur simultaneously. The commentarial system does not acknowledge this possibility but several suttas mighl be read as suggesting that insight can occur within the jhana and . does not require the meditator, to withdraw before beginning contemplation. In AN, see in particular 9:36; see too MN 52.4—14, I 350-52; MN 64.9-15,1 435-37. . 862 The readings vary. Ee has dhanimuddhaccaviggahltamana; the ter­ mination -mana is suspicious..Be has -viggahitarn manasam. Ce has -inggahltam 'manam. While maria and manasam can both be translated as "mind," manam normally means "conceit." The Sinhala translation seems to support this by rendering manam as adhimanaya (Pali adhimana), "overestimation of oneself," but tc speak of "conceit"— as opposed to "mind"—as being "grasped by restlessness" does not make good sense. Mp glosses the term without specifying the subject: "Grasped, thoroughly grasped, by restlessness, which consists of the ten corruptions of insight (dasa vipassan'upakkilesS.; see Vism 633-38, Ppn 20.105-28) in regard to the dhammas of serenity and insight." Nothing in the text itseli suggests the corruptions of insight are involved. I understand the person being described here as a practitioner who reflects deeply on the Dhamma, acquires a sense of urgency, and then finally settles down and gains insight when meeting w ith favor­ able supporting conditions. In the next sentence of the text, the word rendered "mind" is cittam. 863 The first part of this sutta, up to the section on the four acquisi­ tions of individuality, is also at SN 12:25, II39-41, but addressed to Ananda. 864 Mp explains this with reference to the Abhidhamma scheme of cittas, types of consciousness; see CMA 32-40,46-64.1 summarize Mp's explanation: Bodily volition is of twenty kinds by way of the eight kinds of sense-sphere wholesome cittas and twelve kinds of unwholesome cittas. So too for verbal volition. But mental voli­ tion includes these as well as the nine kinds of sublime (mahag- gata) volition, namely, volition associated with the five jhanas


-----

###### Because of bodily volition, there arises pleasure conditioned by the eight kinds of wholesome kamma, and pain conditioned by the twelve kinds of unwholesome kamma, that is,, the kamma generated in the corresponding active types of consciousness. So too for the other two doors. Ignorance is a condition (avijjdpaccayd va) because, there being ignorance, volition occurs in the three doors as a condition for pleasure and pain. Thus this sutta state­ ment refers to. ignorance as the root cause. Pleasure and pain arise "internally" (ajjhattam) When they arise in oneself. The word seems to underscore the retributive aspect of. kamma. 865 . Mp: "One acts on one's own (samam ) when one initiates the action without instigation from others. One instigates activity . because of others when others encourage or command one to act. . One acts with clear comprehension (sampajano) when one knows the wholesome and unwholesome as such, and their respective results as such. If one does not understand this, one acts without clear comprehension." 866 Imesu bhikkhave dhammesu avijja anupatita. Mp: "Ignorance is com­ prised in the volitional states analyzed above, .functioning both as a coexistent condition and as a decisive-support condition (sahajdtavasena ca upahissayavaseria ca). Thus the round of exis­ tence and its root, ignorance, are shown." 867 Mp: "Arahants are seen acting with the body. They sweep the courtyard of the shrine and the bodhi tree, go out and return, do various duties, etc., but in their case the twenty volitions occurring at the bodily door no longer produce kammic results (avipakadhammatam apajjanti). Here, it is the volition that occurs at the body door that is intended by the word 'body.' The same method applies to the other two." Mp-t: ''When arahants perform actions, how is it that they create no bodily or other kinds of kamma? In the sense that these deeds do not bear results, for an action done by an arahant is neither wholesome nor unwholesome but a mere activity (kiriyamatta) that does not yield results." 868 Mp: "'Field/ etc., are names for wholesome and unwholesome kamma. For that is a field (khetta) in the sense of a place where results grow; a site (vatthu) in the sense of their foundation; a base (Uyatana) in the sense of a cause; a location (adhikarana) in the sense of a locale." 869 In Ee this sentence marks the beginning of a new sutta, and thus at this point Ee's numbering exceeds mine by one. Both Ce and Be, in accord with Mp, treat the previous passage and this one as a single sutta. While this paragraph certainly looks like the beginning of an independent sutta, and perhaps originally was, Mp takes it to be continuous with the analysis of volition

 stated above. It says that up to this point the Buddha has shown the kamma accumulated in the three doors; now he shows the places where that kamma ripens. "Acquisition of individuality" (attabhavappatildbha) is an individual existence, the combination of body and mind that constitutes a particular life. 870 Mp identifies these beings as the devas corrupted by play {,khiddapadosika deva). While they are enjoying celestial delights in their heavenly realm, they sometimes forget to eat and drink, and because they misis a .meal they wither away like a garland placed in the sun. See Bodhi 2007: 159-60. 871 Mp says these are the devas corrupted by mind (manopadosika deva), who dwell in the realm of the four great kings. When they become angry at one another, their mutual anger becomes the cause for both to pass away. See Bodhi 2007: 160-61. 872 Mp says that these are human beings. For people kill themselves and others kill them. Thus they perish either on account of their own volition or because of the volition of others. 873 'Mp: "[Question:] Why does Sariputta pose this question? Isn't, he able to answer it himself? [Reply:] Fie is able, but he does not . speak because he thinks, 'This question is in the domain of a Buddha.'" 874 Mp: "The former, who come back to this state of being (agantaro itthattam), are those who return to the five aggregates in the sense sphere; they are not reborn there [in the realm where they pass away] or in a higher realm. Those who do not come back to this state of being (anagantaro itthattam) do not return to the five aggregates or take a lower rebirth. They are either reborn there [in the realm where they pass away] or in a higher real in, or they attain final nibbana right there. When it is said that they are reborn in a higher realm, this is said in the case of those who had been born in a lower existence. But from the realm of neither-perception- nor-non-perception, there is no rebirth into a higher realm." 875 Odhiso vyahjanaso. Mp glosses these two words respectively with karanaso akkharaso, "by way of reasons [or cases], by way of the letter." The meaning is not entirely clear to me and Mp-t does not elaborate. The patisambhidas are explained alfVism 440-43, Ppn 14.21-31, on the basis of Vibh 292—94 (Be §§^18-24), which analyzes them from several angles. Briefly: Knowledge of mean­ ing is analytical knowledge of meaning (<attPiqpatisambhida); knowledge of Dhamma is analytical knowledge of Dhainrna (dhammapatisambhida); knowledge of how to^.express and articulate the Dhamma is analytical knowledge of language (niruttipatisambhida); and knowledge about knowledges is ana­


-----

###### last analytical knowledge seems to refer to the ability to spon­ taneously apply the other three types of knowledge to clearly communicate the Dhamma. From a more philosophical per­ spective, attha is considered the result of a cause (hetuphala) and dhamma a cause (hetu) producing an effect. Therefore the analyti­ cal knowledge of meaning is correlated with knowledge of the first and third noble truths, analytical knowledge of Dhamma with knowledge of the second and fourth noble truths. Analyti­ cal knowledge of meaning is knowledge of each factor of depen­ dent origination in its role as an effect arisen from a condition, and analytical knowledge of Dhamma is knowledge of the same factor in its role as a condition giving rise to an effect. 876 Ee's pakasemi, as the third verb, is not in Ce or Be. Pakaseti is also absent in the same sjequence of verbs-at 3:136,1 286,9-io, also in Ee. 877. The text is cryptic here and may have become garbled in the course of transmission. Mp supplies a verb to the first part of the sentence, upagacchatu, which I include and translate in brackets. Mp fills out aham veyyakaranena with ahamassa panhakathanena cittam aradhessami ("I will satisfy his mind by answering the ques­ tion"). I have also added this in brackets. 878 Mp: "'Our teacher, who is highly skilled in these things that have been attained by us, is present. If 1 had not realized the analytical knowledge of meaning, he would dismiss me, telling me to first realize it.' Even while sitting in front of the teacher, he roars a lion's roar." 879 The dialogue here seems to be concerned with the "ontological status" of the arahant who has attained the nibbana element without residue remaining, that is, with the question whether the liberated person exists or does not exist after death. 880 Mp glosses ma h'evam with evam ma. bhani, "Do not speak thus," and explains that the four questions are asked by way of eter- nalism, annihilationism, partial eternalism, and "eel-wriggling" (sassaia-uccheda-ekaccasassata-amaravikkhepa). Thus Sariputta rejects each question. "Eel-wriggling" is agnosticism, skepticism, or intellectual evasiveness. ( 881 Appapancam papanceti. Mp: "He creates proliferation [or specula­ tions] in relation to something that should not be proliferated [or speculated about]. He travels along a path that one should not travel on." The Pali word papanca suggests mental fabrication, obsessive mental construction, and deluded conceptualization, whiclt the commentaries say arise from craving, conceit, and wrong views (tanka, mana, clitthi). It seems to me that Mp under­ stands appapancam as a contraction of appapanciyam. A Chinese

 assertions about the six bases for contact], these are just empty words ( j l t i l l j a l ' s ) .  With the vanishing, fading away, cessation, and stilling of the six bases for contact, one relinquishes empty falsehood and attains nibbana." 882 Tavatd papancassa gati. Mp: "As far as the range of the six bases extends, just so far extends the range of proliferation, distin­ guished by way of craving, views, and conceit." 883 Ee treats this sutta as a continuation of the preceding one, with­ out counting it separately. Thus at this point Ee's numbering catches up with Ce and Be. 884 The dialogue, according to Mp, refers to making an end to samsara, the entire round of suffering {vattadukkhassa anta- karohoti, sakalam vattadukkham paricchinnam pavivatumam katva titthati). 885 Caranasampanno yathabhutamjanati passati. Yathdbhutam janam passam antakaro hoti. This differs from the previous assertion (that one Cannot become an end-maker by means of knowledge and conduct) in its emphasis on knowing and seeing (as well as conduct) as active functions rather than subjective possessions tinged with clinging. 886 This sutta merges 2:130-33. 887 Much of this is also in MN 62.8-11,1421-23. See too MN 28 and MN 140, which treat the topic more elaborately. 888 Ee's panhaya cittam virajeti is clearly wrong, hi each of the four paragraphs, pannaya here should be replaced by the name of the element. 889 Sakkayanirodham. Mp: "The cessation of personal existence, that is, the round of existence with its three realms; the meaning is nibbana." 890 These are explained at Vibh 330—31 (Be §799), though in terms of wisdom (pafina). I quote only the text on the first jhana: "When perception and attention are accompanied by sensuality in one who attains the first jhana, wisdom pertains to deterioration; when mindfulness is stabilized in accordance with its nature, wisdom pertains to stabilization; when perception and attention are unaccompanied by thought, wisdom pertains to distinction. When perception and attention are accompanied by disenchant­ ment, conjoined with dispassion, wisdom pertains to penetra­ tion" (pathamassa jhanassa labhim kamasahagata sannamanasikard samudacaranti hanabhagini pafina; tadanudhammata sati santitthati thitibhaginlpafina; avitakkasahagata sannamanasikard samudacaranti visesabhdginlpanna; nibbidasahagata sannamanasikard samudacaranti virdgupasamhitd nibbedhabhagini pafina). Similar distinctions are

###### 891 This passagie is also included in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta, DN 16.4.7, at II 124-26. 892 Mahapadese. Mp glosses as maha-okase (apparently as if the com­ pound could be resolved maha + padese) and as maha-apadese, the latter explained as "great reasons stated with reference to such great ones as the Buddha and others" (buddhadayo mahante mahante apadisitva vuttani mahakaranani). This second resolu­ tion is certainly to be preferred. DOP gives, among the mean­ ings of apadesa, "designation, pointing out, reference, witness, authority." Cattaro mahapadesa is sometimes rendered "four great authorities" but the sutta actually specifies only two authorities, the suttas and the Vinaya. Walshe, in LDB, renders it as "four criteria." I understand the term to mean "four great references," the four provenances of a teaching. 893 Tdnipadabyanjanani...sutteotdretabbani vinciyesandassetabbani. Mp gives various meanings of sutte and vinaye here, some improb­ able. Clearly, this instruction presupposes that there already existed a body of discourses and a systematic Vinaya that could be used to evaluate other texts proposed for inclusion as authen­ tic utterances of the Buddha. Otaretabbdni is gerundive plural of otarenti, "make descend, put down or put into," and otaranti, just below, means "descend, come down, go into." My renderings, respectively, as "check for them" and "are included among" are adapted to the context. Sandassetabbani is gerundive plural of san- dassenti, "show, make seen," and sandissanti means "are seen." 894 The clearer of the two Chinese parallels is in DA 2, at T I 17b29- 18a22. H ere cattaro mahapadesa is rendered "four great teaching dhammas." I translate the first declaration (T I 17c2-i3) as follows: "If there is a bhikkhu who claims: 'Venerable ones, in that village, city, country, I personally heard [this] from the Buddha, I personally received this teach in g/ you should not disbelieve what you hear from him, nor should you reject it, but through the suttas determine whether it is. true or false; based on the Vinaya, based on the Dhamma, probe it thoroughly. If w hat he says is not the sutta, not the Vinaya, not the Dhamma, then you should say to him: 'The Buddha did not say this. W hat you have received is mistaken! [Or: You have received it erro­ neously!] For what reason? Because based on the suttas, based on the Vinaya, based on the Dhamma, we [find] that what you said deviates from the Dhamma. Venerable one, you should not uphold this, you should not report it to people, but should dis­ card it/ But if what he says is based on the suttas, based on the Vinaya, based on the Dhamma, then you should say to him:

Venerable one, you should uphold this, you should widely report it to people; you should not discard it/ This is the first great teaching dhamma." 895 I follow Ce and Ee here. Be differs and would be translated: "But if, when one does not speak about what one has seen, wholesome qualities decline and unwholesome qualities increase, I say. that . one should speak about what one has seen." Each of the follow­ ing paragraphs varies in the same way. 896 Naham kvacana, kassaci kincanatasmim, na ca mama kvacana, kat- thaci kincanatatthi. At 3:70,1206,18-20, this formula is said to have been used by the Niganthas to cultivate non-possessiveness. I follow the reading in Ce. Be is almost the same, except that it has kvacani twice in place of kvacana. Ee at the end reads kincanam ' n'atthi rather than kincanat'atthi or kincanatatthi. This reading is also found in older Sinhala-script editions, and in the Be reading of MN 106.8, . . ' . My rendering follows Mp, which comments: "This is an expla­ nation of four-pointed emptiness (catukkotisunnata). I am not any­ where (naham kvacana): He does not see [his] self anywhere. The belonging of anyone (kassaci kincanatasmim): He does not regard his self as an entity that could be taken up by anyone else, that is, he cannot be taken up by thinking of him as a brother in the position of a brother, a friend in the position of a friend, an employee in the position of an employee. Nor is there anywhere anything . .. that is mine (naca mama kvacana): Here, we temporarily put aside the word 'mine' (mama). The meaning is then: 'He does not see anywhere the self of another/ Now,, having brought in the word 'mine/ we get: [Anything] in any place that is mine (mama kvacana, katthaci kincanatatthi): He does not see: 'There is somewhere the self of another that might become my belonging.' The meaning is that he does not see any self of another in any position that could be taken up as his belonging: a brother in the position of a brother, a friend in the position of a friend, an employee in the position of an employee." 897 Akincannamyeva patipadam patipanno hoti. Mp says that he is practicing the way without impediments, without grasping (nippalibodham niggahanameva patipadam patipanno hoti). MN 106.8, II 263y33-264,3, however, offers this formula as a meditation device for attaining the base of nothingness (akincanndyatanam samapajjati). 898 The questions and the Buddha's reply are stated as verse at SN

###### 1714 The Ahguttara Nikaya

 899 Mp identifies both ummagga and patibhana with wisdom (panna): "Acumen is rising up, that is, the movement of wisdom. Or wis­ dom itself is called 'acumen/ in the sense of rising up. It is [also called] 'discernment' in the sense of discerning" (ummaggo ti ummujjanam, panfiagamanan ti attho. Pannci eva va ummujjanatthena um m aggo ti vuccati. Sa va patibhanatthena patibhanam). 900 There is a change in the text from ceteti in the preceding sentence to cintamano cinteti here. It is hard to determine whether this has any significance. Mp does not comment on it, so I assume it is unimportant. 901 Mp identifies him as Uddaka Ramaputta, one of the Buddha's teachers before his enlightenment. See M N.26.16,1 165-66.. 902 Mp explains the purport of this apparent digression thus: "The brahmin, being a good person himself, praises King Eleyya, his retinue, and Uddaka Ramaputta. For the. bad person is like a blind man, and a good person like one with good sight. As a blind man does not see either One who is blind or One with sight, so a bad person does riot know either a good person or a bad one. But just as one with good sight can see both a blind person and one with sight, so a good person can know both a good person and a bad one. The brahmin [Vassakara], thinking:
 •Even Todeyya, being a good person, knew who were bad men,' was delighted because of this and said: Tt is astounding, Master Gotama!"' 903 Be and Ee read sotanugatanam bhikkhave dhammanam. Ce has sotanudhatanam here, and sotanudhata honti just below, as against Be and Ee sotanugata honti; however, Ce has sotanugatam in the uddana verse. Mp (Ce) reads sotanugatanam. Mp glosses: "Hav­ ing applied the sensory ear, one has determined [the meaning] with the ear of knowledge" (pasadasotam odahitva nanasotena vavatthapitanam). This seems to support sotanudhatanam, but just below Mp (Be) glosses sotanugata honti with sotam anuppatta anupavittha honti, which suggests the reading sotanugatanam. Mp (Ce), though reading sotanugatanam in the lemma of the ear­ lier sentence, inconsistently reads here sotanudhata honti. Thus a number of texts reveal that the compilers were themselves uncertain of the reading. There is no recorded Chinese parallel. 904 The sentence is highly problematic, with respect to both reading and meaning. First, the reading: with Ce I read tassa tattha sukhino dhammapadapilapanti. I construe dhammapadapilapanti as a sandhi formed from dhammapada and apilapanti, meaning "to recite, to enunciate." The verb is possibly a corruption of abhilapanti (see DOP sv apilapati). Be has tassa tattha sukhino dhammapada plavanti.

###### Notes to the Fours 1715

 seems unacceptable. In a short paper on this passage, Norman (1992: 257-59) opines that the verb is api-lapanti = abhi + lapanti. The Be reading plavanti apparently takes the verb to be from the root pin, to float, perhaps via pilavanti. A second problem arises from the phrase tassa tattha sukhino. Sukhino can be either a dative-genitive singular or a nomina­ tive plural, and thus the phrase can be construed to mean either "to him who is happy there'7 (with tassa and sukhino as dative singulars denoting the same subject) or "to him, the happy ones there" (with tassa denoting the one reborn, and sukhino a nomi­ native plural .denoting those already there). The connection of the phrase with the words that follow will differ depending on which alternative is chosen. Mp (Be) opts for the first alterna­ tive, taking dhammapada as the nominative subject, plavanti as the verb, and tassa sukhino as the dative indirect object: "Passages of the Dhamma float up to.him who is happy there." Commenting on the phrase in this sense, Mp .(Be) says: "To the one reborn who is muddled in mind in his next existence, the teachings of the Buddha's words that he had recited, being rooted in his past recitation of them, all float up clearly discerned like images in a pure mirror." Mp (Ce), interestingly, records the lemma as dhammapadapilapanti, and reads the gloss: te sabbe pasanne adase chaya viya apilapanti upatthahanti. I assume that the verb apilapanti entered here because Sinhala-script manuscripts of AN retained the original verb, which then migrated back to the commentary to replace plavanti or pilavanti. Otherwise it is hard to account for plavanti in Be. Mp (Ce) also includes the verb upatthahanti, "[theyj appear to," missing in Be, perhaps through editorial over­ sight. This verb is evidently intended as a gloss on apilapanti/ plavanti. I depart from Mp and follow Norman in taking tassa and sukhino to denote different persons: tassa the indirect dative object and sukhino the nominative plural subject. I take the verb to be transitive apilapanti (= abhilapanti) with dhammapada its direct object. Norman (p. 259) affirms that neuter nouns in the accusative plural occasionally end in —a. Thus I understand the line to mean that "the happy ones"— the devas in the celestial realm— "recite passages of Dhamma to him," that is, to the per­ son reborn there. 905 Here and just below, I read with Ce and Be purimavohara pacchima- voharam. 906 I render this freely to conform to ordinary English diction.

 of such a nature, this obtaining of individual existence is of such a nature.. . . "  Lokasannivdso is also in 3:40 §2. 907 This charge is also at SN 42:13, IV 340,23-29. According to MN 56.8, 1 375,24-26, it originated among the Jains. 908 This is the Buddha's advice to the Kalamas at 3:65. The interroga­ tion that follows also parallels that used with the Kalamas, but with an additional unwholesome motive. 909 BHSD defines sarambha as "quarrelsomeness" and connects the word with Skt samrambha, which SED explains as "the act of grasping or taking hold of," and gives as meanings "vehemence, impetuosity... fury, wrath against."Sincethe sutta speaks about sarambha as occurring through body, speech, and. mind, I settle for "vehemence." 910 Ce reads lobham vineyya vineyya viharant'o, and so in relation to d'osa, moha, and sarambha. I try to capture this sense with "con­ stantly," though "repeatedly" might also have been used. Be and Ee read simply lobham vineyya viharanto. 911 See MN 56:26, II 383;32-3S4,7. ■ 912 The words sace ceteyyum are inCe and Ee, but not Be. 913 Parisuddhipadhaniya’ngani. I translate the compound in.accor­ dance with Mp's resolution: parisuddhi-atthaya padhaniyahgani. 914 Stlaparisuddhipadhaniyanga, cittaparisuddhipadhaniyanga, ditthi- parisuddhipadhaniyanga, vimuttiparisuddhipadhdniyafiga. Stla- visuddhi, cittavisuddhi, and ditthivisuddhi are included among the seven purifications (satta visuddhi) in MN 24, which is used as the scaffolding for Vism. The four are included among the. nine parisuddhipadhaniyanguni in DN 34.2.2, III 288,16-25, where they are all conjoined with the word visuddhi, for instance, silavisuddhi- parisuddhipadhaniyangam. It is intriguing that no suttas on the seven purifications are included in the Sevens. This suggests a late origin for the scheme, as well as a late origin for MN 24. 915 Tattha tattha pannaya anuggahessami. Mp: "In this and that respect I will assist it with the wisdom of insight (vipassandpannaya)." 916 Since, in the Nikayas, direct understanding of the four noble truths typically marks the attainment of stream-entry, purifi­ cation of view here can be identified with the wisdom of the stream-enterer. This stands in contrast with the scheme of Vism, in which purification of view (ditthivisuddhi) is the third of the seven purifications. Vism explains it as the clear understand­ ing of mental and material phenomena (ndmarupavavatthdna), also known as the delimitation of conditioned phenomena (sahkhdraparicccheda). In the Vism scheme, the attainment of stream-entry (arid each subsequent path) occurs only with the

 seventh purification, purification of knowledge and vision (nanadassanavisuddhi). 917 A separate purification of this name does not occur in the Vism scheme, but perhaps it could be considered the culmination of purification of knowledge and vision. 918 This seems to have been a tenet of the Jains, who sought, through the practice of self-affliction, to eradicate past kamma. See the teaching given by Nataputta (Mahavira) at 3:74. 919 So navanca kammam na kar.oti, purana n ca kammam phussa phussa vyanttkaroti. See p. 1660, note 499. Mp's paraphrase here differs slightly from the earlier one: "Having contacted the kamma again and again by contact with knowledge, he destroys the kamma to be eliminated by means of knowledge. Having contacted the result again and again by resultant-contact, he destroys the kamma to be eliminated by [experiencing] the result.". 920 Mp: "Because he has acquired equanimity, which is embraced by mindfulness and clear comprehension and has mental bal­ ance as its characteristic; 'he dwells equanimous,' mentally bal­ anced in relation to those objects" (satisampajannapaHggahitdya majjhattdkdralakkhandya upekkhaya tesu drammanesu upckkhako majjhatto hutva viharati). 921 This shows the arahant's attitude toward present experience. He knows that his feelings continue only as long as the body and vitality continue, and that with the perishing of the body and the extinction of vitality all feelings will come to an end. Mp explains "will become cool right here (idh 'eva sltlbhavissanti) "thus: "They will become cool, devoid of the disturbance and trouble caused by the occurrence [of the life process]; they will never recur. [This takes place] right here, without his going elsewhere by way of rebirth." 922 Mp: "Here is the application of the simile: The body should be seen as like the tree. Wholesome and unwholesome kamma are like the shadow depending on the tree. The meditator is like the man who wants to remove the shadow; wisdom is like the shovel; concentration is like the basket; insight is like the pick (khanitti, not mentioned in the sutta; DOP defines both kuddala and khanitti as a digging tool, a spade, a trowel). The time of digging up the roots with the pick is like the time of cutting off ignorance with the path of arahantship. The time of reducing the stump to pieces is like the time of seeing the aggregates; the time of splitting the pieces is like the time of seeing the sense bases; the time of reducing them to slivers is like the time of seeing the elements. The time of drying the slivers in the wind and sun is

 of burning the slivers in a fire is like the time of burning the defilements with knowledge. The time of reducing them to ash is like the time when the five aggregates are still occurring [after one reaches arahantship]. The time of winnowing the ashes in a strong wind and letting them be carried away by the current is like the cessation of the five aggregates, which have been cut off a t the root with no further rebirth. As the ashes winnowed and car­ ried away go to the indiscernible state (apannattibha.vupaga.mo), so should one understand the indescribable state (appannattibhavo)
 [reached] by the non-arising of resultant aggregates in renewed . existence." • 923 The crossing of the flood (oghassa nittharana) is a metaphor for the crossing of samsara or the eradication of defilements. The two factors mentioned by Salha are sllavisuddhi and tapojiguccha. The latter comprises diverse types of austerity and self-mortification rejected by the Buddha in his formulation of the "middle Way." In his reply, the Buddha accepts purification of virtuous behav­ ior as one ..of the factors of asceticism (samannahga), but rejects austerity and disgust. 924 See 3:78. 925 Mp explains right concentration spoken of above as the con­ centration of the path and fruit. Right view is the view of the path; the mention Of the four noble truths points to the four paths and three fruits. Right liberation is the liberation of the fruit of arahantship. The mass of ignorance is split by the path of arahantship, which the disciple has reached before he gains the liberation of the fruit. I assume this sutta is included in the Fours by way of moral purity (of body, speech, mind, and livelihood), right concentra­ tion, right view, and right liberation. However, the sutta itself is not sufficiently explicit about this and thus my numbering is hypothetical. 926 Queen Mallika was the wife of King Pasenadi of Kosala. 927 The contents of this sutta are also included in MN 51.8-28, I 342-49. i 928 The expression occurs also at 3:66. See p. 1654, note 463. 929 The ascetic practices to be described are also at 3:156 §2. 930 Be alone has an additional occupation here, goghatako, a cattle butcher. 931 See p. 1658, note 481. 932 Mp: "Craving is called the ensnarer (jaiinl) because it is like a net. For as a net'is sewn tightly together and is thoroughly inter­ woven, so too vis craving. Or it is called the ensnarer because

 streaming (sarita) because it streams and runs on here and there. It is widespread (visata) because it is spread out and dispersed. And it is sticky (visattika) because it sticks, attaches, fastens here and there/' 933 I translate these phrases—some obscure—-with the aid of Mp. "Related to the internal" (ajjhattikassa upadaya) means related to one's own five aggregates. 934 "Related to the external" (bahirassa upadaya) means related to . external five aggregates. 935 Mp says that "because of this" (imina) should be understood to mean "because of this form . .. because of this consciousness" (imina rupena va ... pe ... vinnanena). The passage is opaque as it stands and I am not sure that Mp has caught the original inten­ tion. "Because of this" might have meant "because of a creator God," or "because of primordial matter" or "because of chance or necessity," etc. 936 I am unsure how to explain the inclusion of. this sutta in the Fours. The reason may be the four terms used to describe crav­ ing, enclosed between dashes, but this is a mere hypothesis. 937 DOP defines the verb usseneti as "forms an association (with), is involved," but Mp glosses it with ukkhipati, which DOP says can mean "throws up; raises; lifts up, picks up, holds up; raises up, extols." What follows are the twenty modes of personal- existence view (sakkayaditthi), the view of a real self existing in relation to the five aggregates. There are four modes in relation to each of the five aggregates. 938 There are different readings here: Ce apajjhayate, Be sampajjhayatir Ee pajjhayati. Ee is missing this paragraph but includes the fol­ lowing paragraph; presumably, this was an editorial oversight rather than a difference in the manuscripts. 939 On these four terms, see p. 1681, note 656. 940 In Pali: cintakavi, sutakavi, atthakavi, patibhandkavi.yip says the first creates poetry after reflecting, the second does so based on what he has heard, the third based oh a message, and the fourth spontaneously, through his own inspiration, like the elder Vangisa. 941 See MN 57.7-11,1 389-91. 942 Here an "afflictive bodily volitional activity" (sabyapajjhum kayasahkharam) can be understood as the volition responsible for- the three courses of unwholesome bodily kamma, an "afflictive verbal volitional activity" as the volition responsible for the four courses of unwholesome verbal kamma, and an "afflictive men­ tal volitional activity" as the volition responsible for the three

These are the devas dwelling in the highest divine realm corresponding to the third jhana. 946 Mp: "The volition of the path leading to the end of the round" (vivattagamini maggacetana). 947 I follow here the reading of Ce and Ee: sunna parappavada samanehi anne ti. Be reads annehi for aitne ti. The same difference in read­ ings between the.editions occurs, at MN I 63,30—64/1. In a line of verse without reference to a lion's roar DN II 151,22, has sunna
 - parappavada samanehi anne. Mp says that the "other sects" are the proponents of the sixty-two views, who lack twelve kinds Of ascetics: the four who have attained the fruits, the four cul­ tivating the paths, and the four practicing insight to attain the respective paths. 948 Adhikaranam vupasantam. See p .4623, note 231. 949 The parajikas are the most serious class of offenses. For bhikkhus/ they consist of four offenses that entail expulsion from the Sangha:: sexual intercourse, theft (to a degree punishable by law), murder of a human being, and making a false claim to a superhuman state of spiritual distinction. Bhikkhunls have four additional pSrajikas. The only way for one who has committed one of these offenses to "make amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma" is to admit it and relinquish one's status as a fully ordained monk or nun. For details, see Thanissaro 2007a, chap. 4. 950 The text uses the word bhante here. Apparently this word was not used solely to address monks but also others in a superior position. Thus I here translate it as "worthy sirs." 951 The sahghadisesas are the second most serious class of offenses. For bhikkhus, they include intentional emission of semen, touch­ ing a woman with a lustful mind, speaking lewdly to a woman, falsely accusing a virtuous bhikkhu of a pardjika, etc. Rehabilita­ tion involves a complex process requiring formal meetings of the Sahgha. For details, see Thanissaro 2007a, chap. 5. 952 Ce and Ee assaputam, Be bhasmaputam. Mp: "[His deed] deserves to be punished with a reprehensible sack of ashes on his head" igarahitabbacharikaputena mntthake abhighatdraham). 953 The pacittiyas are a class of offenses that can be cleared by confes­ sion to a fellow monastic. Presumably the nissaggiya-pdcittiyas, offenses which also require the relinquishment of an unsuit­ able item, are also included under this heading. For details, see Thanissaro 2007a, chaps. 7 and 8. 954 This is a smaller class of offenses that can be cleared by confes­

 955 Sikkhdnisamsam idam bhikkhave. brahmacariyam vussaii pannuttaram vimuttisaram satadhipateyyam. In later suttas that use these meta­ phors (8:83,9:14,10:58), mindfulness precedes wisdom and liber­ ation, but the present sutta explains the reason for the inversion of the normal sequence. 956 Abhisamacarika sikkha. Mp: "This is a designation for the type of virtuous behavior that is prescribed by way of duties" (vattava- sena pannattisilass'etam adhivacanam). The commentaries draw a contrast between natural virtuous behavior (pakatislla), modes of virtuous behavior with ethical significance, and prescription- based virtuous behavior (pannattisila) derived from monastic rules prescribing conduct and deportment that are not intrin­ sically ethical, such as not eating after midday, not accepting money, not tickling another monk, etc. The latter are intended by abhisanxacarika sikkha. 957 Mp: "This is a designation for the four major types of virtuous behavior, which are the foundation for the spiritual life of the . path" (maggabrahmacariyassa adibhutanam cdtunnam mahasllanam . etam adhivacanam). Though Mp seems to confine this type of vir­ tue to the four pdrajika offenses, it certainly includes many more training rules included among the other classes of offenses. 958 Mp does not explain in what sense panila is called uttara, but says only: "They are well seen by the wisdom of the path along with insight" (sahavipassanaya maggapafindya sudittha honti). 959 Mp: "They are experienced by the experiential knowledge Of the liberation of the fruit of arahantship" (arahattaphalavimultiyd nanaphassena phuttha honti). 960 As in 4:194. Mp says that insight wisdom (vipassanapanna) is intended here. 961 See 2:55. 962 As at SN 55:60, V 411.. These are also called the four factors that lead to realization of .the fruit of stream-entry (and the higher fruits). See SN 55-58, V 410-11. 963 Ee conjoins this sutta with the preceding one, whereas Ce and Be treat them as distinct. 964 These correspond to the four noble truths, but with the third and fourth truths inverted. 965 As at MN 26.5,1161—62, but the latter is augmented by two more quests: for what is subject to sorrow and for what is subject to defilement. The noble quests are at MN 26.12., I 162-63. 966 See above, 4:32. It seems to me that these two suttas should have been contiguous. 967 He is the monk who threatened to leave the Buddha if the lat­

Despite a partial overlap, these should not be confused with, the fiv6 powers (panca. balani) included among the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment, which are introduced at 5:13-16. Mp: "Trainee's powers: the powers of the seven trainees. The power of faith is so called because it does not waver (na kampati) in the face of faithlessness; the power of moral shame does not waver in the face of moral shamelessness; the power of moral dread does not waver in the face of moral recklessness; the power of energy does not waver in the face of laziness; and the power of wisdom does not waver in the face of ignorance." 975 In Be only. 976 For the distinction between moral shame (hiri) and moral dread (ottappa), with references, see 2:8—9 and p . 1622, note 225. 977 Mp explains udayatthagamini panna, "the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away," as "the wisdom able to penetrate. the arising and vanishing of the five aggregates (pancannam khandhanam udayavayagaminiya udayanca vayanca pativijjkitum samatthaya).

 980 See 4:8 for a parallel treatment of the four grounds of self- confidence, 6:64 for six Tathagata's powers, and 10:21,10:22 for the ten Tathagata's powers. 981 These are the five powers (panca balani) included among the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment (bodhipakkhiya dhamma). These five powers are, as factors, identical with the five facul­ ties (panc'indriyani), but the two are distinguished by a difference in aspect. See SN 48:43, V 219—20, and its commentary, Spk III 247,2^7, which explains that the faculty of faith means rulership in regard to conviction, and the power of faith means being unshak­ able in the face of absence of faith (adhimokkhalakkhane indatthena saddhindriyam, assaddhiye akampanena saddhabalam). Similarly,, the other four faculties respectively exercise rulership in regard to exertion, presence, non-distraction, and understanding (jmggah'a- upatthana-avikkhepa-pajdnana) and the other four powers remain unshakable in the face of laziness, muddle-mindedness, distrac­ tion, and ignorance (kosajja-mutthasacca-vikkhepa-avijjd). 982 The four factors of stream-entry (cattari sotapattiyahgani): unwaver­ ing confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sahgha, and the virtuous behavior dear to the noble ones. See 9:27,10:92. 983 Mp: "The factor of proper conduct (dbhisamdcarikam dhammam) is supreme conduct consisting in prescribed virtuous behavior by way of duties (uttamasamdcarabhutam vattavasena pahnattasilam; see 4:245 §1, where the term used is dbhisamdcdrika sikklid). The factor of a trainee (sekham dhammam) is the virtuous behavior pre­ scribed for a trainee. Virtuous behaviors (silani) are 'the four great virtuous behaviors' (cattari mahaslldni; presumably the four types of behavior safeguarded by the four pardjika rules). Right view is the right view of insight (vipassanasammaditthi); right concentra­ tion is the concentration of the path and fruit." 984 From here to "not properly concentrated for the destruction of the taints" is also at SN 46:33, V 92. 985 As at 3:101,1 254,10- 12. Instead of muddikaya MN III 243,21, has pavattikdya and AN I 254,10, and AN 1 257,26, have pattakdya. 986 The following supernormal powers are also at 3:101. On the "suitable basis," see p. 1669, note 562. 987 Mp identifies "knowledge and vision of things as they really are" (yathabhiitananadassana) with tender insight; "disenchant­ ment" (nibbidd) with strong insight; "dispassion" (virago) with the noble path. Mp would resolve vimuttinanadassana into vimutti and nanadassana, with the former representing the fruit (phala- vimutti) and the latter reviewing knowledge (paccavekkhananana). I translate, however, in accordance with the normal meaning,


-----

###### 988 Mp: " Right view here is the right view of insight. Liberation of mind ( cetovimutti) is the concentration of the path and fruit, and liberation by ivisdom (pannavimutti) is the knowledge of the fruit." Ps 1164,29-31, commenting on cetovimuttim pafinavimuttim at MN I 35,36-37, identifies liberation of mind with the concentration per­ taining to the fruit of arahantship, and liberation by wisdom with the wisdom pertaining to the fruit of arahantship. 989 Vimuttayatanani. Mp: "Causes of being liberated" (vimuccana- karanani). 990 So tasmim dhamme attha patisamvedl ca hoti dhammapatisamvedl ca. Mp explains atthapatisamvedl as "one knowing the meaning of the text" (pali-attham janaritassa)-and dhammapatisamvedl as ""one knowing the text" (p&lim janantassa), but this explanation is certainly too narrow and anachronistic. At 6:10, we find labhaii atthavedam labhati dhammavedam, which I render "[he] gains inspi­ ration in the meaning, inspiration in the Dhamma." The stem of patisamvedl is vedl, which obviously connects atthapatisamvedl and dhammapatisamvedl to atihaveda and dhammaveda. T h e root vid is related both to vijja, knowledge, and Vedaria, .feeling. Thus I suggest veda should be understood as inspired knowledge, or "inspiration/' which gives rise to pamojja and piti, joy and rap­ ture. It is likely that atthapatisamvedl and dhammapatisamvedl are related to atthapatisambhida and dhammapatisambhida, though in Pali the latter are connected to the verb bhindati, "to break, to divide." See too pp. 1643-44, note 403. 991 Mp explains this to mean "he is concentrated by the concentration of the fruit of arahantship" (arahattaphalasamadhina samadhiyati). It seems improbable to me that this was the original intention, for the context suggests that this is a concentration that serves as the basis for insight, and thereafter for the attainment of path and fruit, not a concentration that occurs subsequent to realization. 992 Appamanan. Mp: "Devoid of measure-creating qualities, world- transcending" (parnanakaradhamirmrahitam lokuttaram). Normally, the Nikayas identify the measureless concentration with the four divine abodes (brahmavihara), but some texts also recognize a world-transcending measureless concentration, obtained with the destruction of the three "measure-producing" qualities: greed, hatred, and delusion. See MN 43.35,1 298,8 9; SN 41:7, IV ' 297,11-12. 993 See p. 1669, notes 560-61. 994 Be omits samadhim. Apparently this is not a typographical error, as according to a note in Ee, the same omission commonly occurs in Burmese manuscripts. 995 Since the concentration to be explained below is primarily the

 four jhanas and, probably, the concentration of insight, Mp does not take the word ariya here to refer to the noble paths and fruits but as meaning "far away from the defilements abandoned by way of suppression (vikkhambhanavasena pahinakilesehi araka thitassa)." Iri the commentaries, ariya is sometimes derived from araka. While the etymology is playful, it is likely that this samadhi belongs to the preparatory practice for reaching the paths and fruits, not to the paths and fruits themselves. 996 Paccavekkhananimittam. Mp identifies this as reviewing knowl­ edge (paccavekkhanananameva), apparently referring to the knowh edge that reviews the path and fruition attainments. However, since this use of the word paccavekkhana seems peculiar to the commentaries, I think it more likely that paccavekkhananimitta . here; means the object being examined by insight. 997 See p. 1669, note 562. 998 Clratthitiko hoti. Mp: "If one has acquired the mark [of concentra­ tion] while standing up, it is lost when one sits down. If one has acquired the mark while sitting, it is lost when one lies down. But .. for one who has resolved on walking up and down and acquired . the mark in a moving object, it is not lost even when one stands still, sits down, and lies down." 999 Mp says that insight (vipassana) has been discussed here in five " ways. 1000 Mp identifies her as a daughter of King Pasenadi of Kosala. 1001 See 4:87 §4. 1002 Only four kinds of superiority are mentioned, unless the fifth is wealth (bhoga) rather than authority (adhipateyya), as mentioned in the following couplet. 1003 This includes an expanded parallel of 4:34. 1004 .Mp, commenting on the preceding sutta, says she was a daughter of King Bimbisara. 1005 Strangely, neither Ce nor Ee contains this paragraph, which is in Be. It seems necessary to complete the set of five items. The paragraph is found in all three editions of the Fours. The parallel It §90, 88, does not include this paragraph, but It §90 is included in the Threes and thus must limit itself to three objects of faith. 1006 Virage dhamme.

 either the physical body or a group. Mp identifies these deities with the "devas who delight in creation." Because they create any form that they wish and take delight in it, they are called either "delighting in creation" or "agreeable" (mandpa nama te deva ti nimmanaratl deva; te hi icchiticchitarn vupam mapetva abhiramanato nimmanaratl ti ca manapa ti ca vuccanti). See 8:46, where the Bud­ dha enumerates eight conditions that lead to rebirth into the company of the agreeable-bodied devas. 1010 There are. various readings of the compound here: Ce icchacarena, Be issacarena, Ee issavadena. My translation follows Ee. Interest­ ingly, at 8:46, there is a verse with an identical couplet but with the reading issavadena in all three editions. A search through CST 4.0 for icchacar* turns up many occurrences of this compound in commentarial texts but none in canonical texts. It thus seems likely that the Ce reading has been influenced by. the editor's familiarity with the commentarial expression. 1011. He was originally a lay follower of the Jains. The story of his conversion is told at 8:12. 1012 Sanditthikam danaphalam. A benefit that can be experienced in this present life. 1013 Visdrado upasankamati amankubhuto. Mp explains "confidently" (visarado) as knowledgeable and joyous (nanasomanassappatto) and "composed" (amankubhuto) as not diffident (na nittejabhuto). 1014 Samparayikam danaphalam. With this fifth benefit, the Buddha has gone beyond Siha's original request and explained, not a directly visible fruit of giving, but a fruit pertaining to the next life. 1015 Nandana: the Garden of Delight in the Tavatimsa heaven. 1016 A yum , vannam, sukham, balam, patibhanam. See 4:57, 4:58. 1017 They "show compassion" (anukampeyyum ) to them by offering them an opportunity to give alms and thereby acquire merit. Thus it is not so much the laypeople who show compassion to the monastics by giving them aims (though this is true), but the monastic who shows compassion to laypeople by approach­ ing their homes to receive their offerings. By giving alms lay­ people create the seeds for a happy rebirth and the attainment of nibbana. The monastics may also teach the Dhamma to the laypeople and in this way give them access to the teachings. 1018 An expanded parallel of 3:48. All the items mentioned in the sim­ ile of the mountain are identical in both suttas, but 3:48 reduces them to three by grouping together several as compounds, while the present sutta enumerates them separately. The present sutta adds learning (suta) and generosity (caga) to the things people grow in. The verses are identical in both suttas.

 kulaputtam. Be of my 3:48 (3:49 in Be's own enumeration) has kulapatim in the corresponding place. 1020 From this part on, this sutta closely parallels 4:61. The five items are obtained by dividing the first of the latter into two parts. The verses in the two suttas are identical. 1021 I read with Be and Ee dhammaguttam, as against Ce devaguttam, which seems redundant here. 1022 Compare with the opening of 4:61. 1023 In each paragraph, I read with Ce va pihetum, as against Be vapi hetu, Ee va pi hetum. The verb piheti (infinitive pihetum) means "to yearn for." The idea of passively yearning seems implied by the contrast with practicing the way as a means of fulfilling one's wish. 1024 Ayusamvattanika patipada. Mp: "The meritorious practice of giv­ ing, virtuous behavior, etc." For an analysis of the specific rela-^ tionship between present actions and their results,, see MN 135. 1025 The text switches back arid forth between singular and plural forms of sagga. 1026 These verses are also at SN 3:17,1 87; SN 3:18,1 89. 1027 Atthabhisamaya. I base this rendering on the gloss in Mp: Atthassa abhisctmagamena, atthappatilabhena ti vuttam hoti. 1028 Salapupphakam khadaniyam. Mp: "A food similar to sal flour; it is made with hill-rice flour prepared with the four sweets (honey, sugar, butter, and ghee)." 1029 Reading with Be sampannakolakamsUkaramamsam. Mp: "The flesh of a one-year-old pig cooked with spices such as cumin seeds, etc., together with sweet jujube fruits." 1030 Ce nibaddhatelakam naHyasakam (Be nibattatelakam naliyasakam). Mp: "The vegetable stalks are cooked in ghee mixed with cumin and other spices, which have been pulverized together with hill- rice flour; then they are coated with the four sweets and put out until they acquire a particular aroma." 1031 So Ce. Be and Ee "over a hundred thousand" (adhikasatasahassam). Presumably this refers to kahapanas, the major currency unit. 1032 Reading with Ce anaggahltam, as against Be and Ee anuggahltam. 1033 Annataram manomayam kayam upapajjati. I follow Mp in taking, this expression, as used here, to mean that he was reborn among a group (kayo) of deities rather than that he was reborn with a mind-made body. Mp: "[Reborn] into a group of devas in the pure abodes who are produced through the mind of jhana" (suddhavasesu ekam jhanamanena nibbattam devakayam). Also, at AN III 348,28-349,1 (= V i 39,5-3) we find tusitam kayam upapanno, where kayam must mean "group " In relation to the spiritual


-----

###### powers, manomaya kaya signifies a subtle body produced by the meditative mind, as at AN I 24,2. See too 5:166. 1034 It is hard to see why this sutta is included in the Fives. Could it be that the original version had only five items of offering and a sixth was added later, after the sutta was included in the Fives? 1035 This is an expanded parallel of 4:51. The additional factor is obtained by replacing "a lodging" (senasanam) with "a dwell­ ing" (viharam) and "bed and chair" (mancapitham). 1036 As in Be and Ee.. The omission from Ce must be an editorial oversight, as the thousands of gallons are in the Ce version of 4;51. 1037 I have filled in this definition here; all three editions abridge. 1038 -The verses are also at 4:52. 1039 The text uses a reflexive causative form: attanamyeva parinibbapeti. This might also have been rendered: "He extinguishes himself/' or "He. quenches himself/' What is literally extinguished is the bitter feeling of sorrow, but the verb parinibbapeti, related to the noun nibbdna, implies that he reaches ultimate liberation. 1040 I read with Ee attho idha labbha api appako pi (Be is essentially the same). Ce attho alabbho api appako pi means "even the least good cannot be gained," which undermines the point. 1041 Paveniya. Mp: "By family custom (kulavamsena). The meaning is, 'We have traditionally practiced this, and we have not practiced that.'" 1042 This sentence is in the text of Ee, but in parentheses in Be and in a note in Ce.' 1043 Sokasallaharano nama ayam maharaja dhammapariyayo. . 1044 Nahgalamukhani. Lit. "plow mouths." Mp glosses as "channel mouths" (matikamukhahi), explaining: "Because these are similar to plows and are cut by plows, they are called 'plow mouths.'" 1045 Also at SN 47:5, V 145,26-146,5, followed by a declaration that the four establishments of mindfulness are "a heap of the whole­ some" (kusalarasl). Here I follow Be and Ee, which do not include ime in the opening. Ce has ime both in the opening and at the end; Be does not have it in either place. 1046 Na sukaram unchena paggahena yapetun. I take unchena paggahena to denote a single act, not two acts. There is no ca or va to sug-
 - gest that two acts are intended. The gloss inMp also implies that the expression refers to one act: "It is not possible to take one's bowl and sustain oneself by the practice of gleaning" (na sakka hoti pattam gahetva unchacariyaya yapetum). See too the gloss at Sp 1 175,22-23: paggahena yo uhcho, tena yapetum na sukara. 1047 Anhamahnam akkosa ca honti, ahhamannam paribhasa ca honti,


-----

###### similar passage in It §§18-19,10-11, has annamafinam bhandanani ceva honti instead of annamannam akkosa ca honti but is otherwise the same. I translate parikkhepa and pariccajand in accordance with It-a I 69,25-27, which explains parikkhepa as "disparagement and denigration through the ten bases of insults, attacking all around in terms of birth and so forth" (jati-adivasena parito khepa, dasahi akkosavatthuhi khumsanavambhand), and pariccajand as "dis­ missal by way of disciplinary acts of suspension and so forth" (■ukkhepaniyakammakaranadivasena nissdrana). 1048 It might be asked whether the expression pasanndnanca bhiyyo- bhavo hoti means that the number of those with confidence increases, or, alternatively, that those with confidence increase in confidence. Sp 1225,18-24, supports the latter: "Laypeople who have confidence in the Teaching, seeing the bhikkhus follow­ ing the training rules as they have been established/become ever more confident, saying: 'The monks indeed do what is hard to do; for as long as they live they eat once a day7 maintain celibacy, and observe the restraint of the Vinaya'" (yepi sasane pasanna kulaputta tepi sikkhapadapannattim natvd yathdpafinattam patipajjamane bhikkhu ud disva "aho ayya dukkarakarino, ye ydvajlvam ekabhattam brahmacariyam vinayasamvaram anupdlentl" ti bhiyyo bhiyyo pasldanti). 1049 Tesam abhinham dassana samsaggo ahosi, samsagge sati vissaso ahosi; vissase sati otaro ahosi. Though I translate vissaso as "intimacy," the word does not mean that at this point they had intimate physical relations. Vissaso is, rather, a feeling of trust that Can lead to a sexual relationship. For this to occur, however, intimacy must first provide an opening for lust. This is indicated by the expression otaro ahosi. 1050 A violation of the first parajika or expulsion offense. 1051 I follow the sequence of Be and Ee, which read giddha gathita m ucchitd ajjhopannd, as against Ce gathita giddha m ucchita ajjhopannd. The sequence—gathita, mucchita, ajjhopanna— is com­ mon in the texts. 1052 Be and Ee ugghdtitd (Ce ugghanita). Mp glosses with uddhumata, "bloated/' a stage in the decomposition of a corpse. Five such stages are mentioned at 1:480—84. Perhaps the next item, the dead woman, refers to a deceased woman preserved in memory rather than a corpse. Brahmali suggests taking ugghatiia as "obese," but I'm not sure this would work. DOP sv ugghateti2gives "puffed- up, swollen" among its meanings. 1053 Here Ce has merely yampi tarn bhikkhave samma. vadamano vadeyya samantapaso rndrassa ti, which is incomplete. Hence I follow Be

 marassci ti matugamam yeva samma vadamano vadeyya samantapaso marassa ti. 1054 SuvasldO: based on the verb asldati, to approach, with prefix su- and -v- as a liaison consonant. 1055 Mp glosses purakkhata with "forerunners, those who have gone in front" {purecarika purato gatayeva). My rendering "are plunged headlong" is free but captures the sense. Vanarata suggests that kalam, gatim, and bhavabhavam may be abbreviated locatives or split compound factors to be joined withsamsarasmim, but I think the verse may use the accusative for metrical reasons. There is no identified Chinese parallel of this sutta with which to make a comparison. 1056 The expression "I live the spiritual life dissatisfied" (anabhirato ca brahmacariyam carami) implies that he wants to disrobe and return to lay life. 1057 Here the text changes to the plural bhikkhavc. The Buddha is now addressing the monks at large. 1058 The first three themes echo 3:39, with which this sutta lias much in common. 1059 Sabbehi me piyehi manapehi. I use "everyone and everything" to cover both persons and possessions. The Pali implies both, but in English we need two words to span both objects. 1060 Mp: "The path is generated (maggo sanjayati): the world- transcending path is generated. The fetters are entirely abandoned (samyojanani sabbaso pahiyanti): the ten fetters are entirely aban­ doned (see 10:13). The underlying tendencies are uprooted (anusaya byantihonti): the seven underlying tendencies are removed, cut off, terminated (see 7:11). Thus in the aboye five sections insight is discussed; in these five sections, the world-transcending path." 1061 These verses are also at 3:39. They seem to be a self-reproach spoken by the bodhisatta prior to his enlightenment and thus fit better there. The line below—"while I am dwelling thus" {mama evam viharino)—suggests that this is the bodhisatta speaking with reference to his struggle for enlightenment. In pada c I read with Ce yathadhamma tathasanta, as against Be and Ee yatha dhamma tatha satta (though they both concur with Ce in their reading of the earlier sutta). 1062 Ce and Be read nekkhamme datthu khematam. Ee has nekkhammam datthu khemato as its primary reading but mentions the C e/Be variants in its notes. Mp (both Ce and Be) uses the Ce and Be reading as the lemma, which it glosses nibbane khemabhavam disva, biit it then cites the Ee reading as a variant, glossed nibbanam

Mp (Ce): "The owners of the neighboring fields bordering his own fields, and those with whom he does business, who measure the land with measuring rods" {ye attano khettakammantanarn samanta anantarakkheltasamino, te ca rajjudandehi bhumippamanaggahake samvohare ca).

Mp: "The mass of dust arisen from the ground, which has been trampled upon by the feet of the elephants, horses, etc." 1079 This is the prescribed method for renouncing monastic status.. One declares to another person (normally a fellow bhikkhu) one's inability to observe the training, exchanges one's robes for ordinary clothing, takes the five lay precepts, and returns to lay life. 1080 I follow Be and Ee, which do not have ellipsis points here. Ce inconsistently has ellipsis points in this sutta (implying that all three vijja are intended) but not in the paraLlel section of the next sutta. 1081 The following exhortation is also at MN 22.3, 1130,23-31. Many of these similes for Sensual pleasures are elaborated at MN 54.15- 21,1364-67. . 1082 Vafa amanussa, lit., "wild nonhumans," Mp glosses "such nonhumans as rough, violent yakkhas, etc/' (kakkhala duttha yakkhadayo amanussa). 1083 Mp does not com m ent on abhavitakaya, but Spk II 395,16 glosses it as abhavitapancadvarikakaya, "undeveloped in the body of the five sense doors," probably referring to sense restraint. I suspect the term actually refers to the m aintenance of clear comprehension in all modes of deportm ent and in the various bodily activities, as described at AN II 210,21-26 and V 206,25-30. 1084 Iti kho, bhikkhave, dhammasandosa vinayascmdoso; vinayasandosa dhammasandoso. Mp: "How is it that when the Dhamma is becom­ ing corrupt, the discipline becomes corrupt? When the dhammas of serenity and insight are no longer being nurtured, the fivefold discipline no longer exists. But when there is no discipline of restraint among those who are immoral, in its absence serenity and insight are not nurtured. In this way, through corruption of the discipline, there is corruption of the Dhamma." The fivefold discipline by restraint is restraint by virtuous behavior, mindful­ ness, knowledge, patience, and energy (silasamvara, satisamvara, nanasamvara,khantisamvara, viriyasamvara).

 years after a bhikkhu's full ordination, but it can be extended in the case of one who needs more time to gain competence. For details, see Thanissaro 2007a: 29^10. 1086 Abhidhammakatham vedallakatharn kathenta. I take the word abhi­ dhamma here to have a purely referential function, that is, to mean "pertaining to the Dhamma, relating to the Dhamma." It does not denote the canonical collection of that name or its philosophy. See DOP sv abhidhamme. Mp, too, appears to recognize that the Abhidhamma Pitaka is not relevant here, explaining abhidhammakatham. in this passage as a discussion on '"'the supreme teaching concerned with virtuous behavior, etc." (siladi-uttamadhammakatham). It takes vedallakatharn to be a "miscellaneous talk on knowledge connected with inspira- . tional jo y " (vedapatisamyuttarn ndnamissakakatham). MN 43 and MN 44 have vedalla in their title and proceed by way of miscel­ laneous questions and answers between disciples. The "dark Dhamma" (kanhadhamrriam) is said to occur by way of fault­ finding with a mind bent on criticizing others (randhagavesitaya uparatnbhapariyesariavasend). 1087 See 2:47. 1088 Samsattha viharissanti. Mp: "They will bond closely by way of the fivefold bond (pancavidhena samsaggena)." Mp-t: "Five­ fold bond: bonding by hearing, seeing, conversation, eating together, and bodily contact" (savanasamsaggo, dassanasamsaggo, samullapasamsaggo, sambhogasamsaggo, kdyasamsaggo). Mp-t iden­ tifies them all as manifestations of lust and exemplifies the last by the lust arisen through holding hands (hatthaggaha, a sanghadisesa offense when it occurs between a bhikkhu and a woman). Female probationers (sikkhamana) are nuns already ordained as novices who are formally training for full bhikkhuni ordination. 1089 A defiled offense (sahkilittham apattim) here would be a pardjika or a sanghadisesa. 1090 Use of stored-up food (sannidhikaraparibhoga) is prohibited by Pacittiya 38, Vin IV 86-87. Regarding "giving a gross hint" (qlarikartt nimittam), Mp says: "Here, digging the ground and ordering 'Dig!' is called giving a gross hint in regard to the ground. Gutting and ordering 'Cut!' is called giving a gross hint with regard to vegetation." The reference is to Pacittiyas 10 and 11, Vin IV 32-33, 33-35. 1091 Kuhako ca hoti, lapako ca, nemittiko ca, nippesiko ca, labhena ca labharn nijigisita.

 sabyanjnnarn. The same difference appears wherever this phrase occurs. The difference is not trivial; it indicates that for Ce, mean­ ing and phrasing pertain to the dhamma, whereas for Be and Ee they pertain to the brnhmacariyam, the practice of the spiritual life. The terms make better sense in relation to dhamma, teachings that are verbally articulated, than in relation to the brahmacariyam, which is lived rather than spoken. 1094 Be reads here ditthiya. appatividdha, "not penetrated by view," which seems a learned "'correction" to a stock formula. Otherwise we would have expected an adversative conjunction, such as ca or ca pana, to prepare us for the variation on the usual reading. Ce and Ee have the familiar ditthiya suppatividdha, which I follow.. 1095 Yathdvimuttam cittam na paccavekkliati. Mp: "Having reviewed . which faults have been abandoned and which virtues have been obtained, he does not make an effort to obtain higher virtues/' This passage seems to presage the idea of paccavekkhanandna, which figures prominently in the commentaries. . 1096 Mp: "This sutta has discussed the causes for decline and growth of the seven trainees in relation to the higher virtues. The causes for decline of a trainee occur first to the worldling." 1097 Ananulomikena gihisamsaggena. On the five kinds of samsagga, see p. 1733, note 1088. 1098 Anhabyakaranani. Mp: "Declarations of arahantship." . 1099 Akuppam. Probably meaning akuppa cetovimutti, unshakable lib­ eration of mind. Mp identifies this with arahantship. 1100 Sakkaccannevadeti no asakkaccam. Mp: "He gives the blow without despising, without transgressing; he does not do so despising and transgressing." 1101 Annabharanesadanam. Mp glosses annabhara as beggars (yacaka) and nesada as fowlers (sakunika). 1102 The opening story, together with the discourse on the five kinds of teachers, is at Vin II 185-87. 1103 Manomayam kayam upapanno. The mind-made deities are those reborn in the form realm through the power of their past attain­ ment of the jhanas. i 1104 The word for "body" here is attabhavapatilabha. I take patilabha to be merely an idiomatic adjunct and do not think it adds any­ thing to the meaning. Mp glosses as sarirapatilabho, which sup­ ports my supposition that the simple physical body is intended here. The expression attabhavapatilabha occurs in 4:171, where it designates the entire typology of a living being. In that text it cannot be construed narrowly as the physical body, since it also encompasses "thev devas of the base of neither-perception-nor-

 On the size of his body, the text reads dve va tini va magadhikani gamakkhettani. On gamakkhetta Brahmali writes: "This word also occurs at MN III 10,u: ekam gamakkhettani upanissaya viharama, and atMN II 167,27: amhakam gamakkhettain agacchanti. From these passages it seems quite clear to me that gamakkhetta refers to a village together zvith all its fields'' (private communication). The figures for length given by Mp suggest that his body was 3-4.5 miles or 5-7 km tall. 1105 The text says tassa iddhiya, "that psychic potency.," not tassa iddhiya, "his psychic potency." The pronoun refers to a psychic power already mentioned,.yet the sutta does not make clear what it is. The context is provided by Vin II 184,33-185,21, where Deva- datta exercises the psychic power of transforming himself into a young boy wearing a girdle of snakes. He used tliis power to impress Prince Ajatasattu and win his support. Thereupon Deva1 datta thought to wrest control of the Sahgha from the Buddha, whereupon he lost that psychic potency. 1106 Yam tumo karissati tumo'va' tena pannayissati. PED explains the stem tuma as "most likely apostrophe form of atuma = atta, Skt atman self." Mp paraphrases: "One will be known by the action that one does" (yam esa karissati, eso'va tena kammena pakato bhavissati). 1107 A^parisiiddhaveyyakarano. Mp does not comment. Presumably, this refers to his explanation of a point in his teaching or his reply to a question. 1108 Sekhavesarajjakamna dhamma. 1109 Sarajjam. Mp glosses with domanassam , "dejection," but this does not seem sufficiently precise. Sarajja is the condition of one who feels timid, hesitant, and insecure (sarada) when having to appear in public or take a stand in community affairs. Its oppo­ site, vesarajja, is the condition of one who feels at ease and self- confident (visarada) when interacting with others. 1110 Ee's kuppadhammo is evidently an error, though in the notes on variantreadings Ee recognizes the correct reading, akuppadhammo. Mp glosses with khinasavo, one whose taints are destroyed, an arahant. For the Sangha to maintain the respect of the lay com­ munity, it is considered important not only for monastics to be virtuous in their behavior but to avoid actions that might arouse suspicion. Such behavior not only reflects adversely on the indi­ vidual monastic but may also bring discredit to the Dhamma and the Sahgha. Hence this exhortation. 1111 Mp glosses vesiyagocaro with tasam geham abhinhagamano, "fre­ quently going to their homes. " Thus gocara in the narrow sense

Here manta must mean "deliberations"' or "consultations," not mantras. Mp offers only a verbal gloss, guhitabbamanta. 1115 Antaggahikaya. Mp: "He grasps hold of eternalism or annihilationism." 1116 This sutta reproduces 4:87 §4, the delicate ascetic among ascetics section, here divided into five secondary sections. 1117 Phasuvihara. These are five of the better known six principles of cordiality, at 6:11—12. 1118 No param adhislle sampavatta. I take adhisile here to have the purely referential sense "in regard to virtuous behavior," and not to imply "higher virtuous behavior" (though, Of course, since "vir­ tuous behavior" is identified with restraint by the Patimokkha, the "higher virtuous behavior" is implied). Mp supports this referential understanding of adhisile with its glOss: "He does not censure or reproach others in regard to virtuous behavior" (param silabhavena na garahati na upavadati). 1119 Catuddiso. Mp: "He moves about without obstruction in the four quarters" (catiisu disasu dppatihatacaro). 1120 Ce does not have a title at the beginning of the vagga, but it includes the title before the uddana verse at the end- 1121 The meaning is not transparent and readings vary.

For one who squanders it, there is an offense of wrongdoing" (na ca bhikkhave saddhadeyyani oin ip a tetabbam; yo vinipateyya, dpatti dukkatassa). This is an offense because it shows disregard for the generosity of others. After taking the top portion for oneself, however, one can share the rest with others. The Buddha also made a unique allowance for a monastic to give almsfood, cloth, and other gains to his or her parents if they are in neecl- .1125 I follow the punctuation of Be and Ee, which connect dhammanam udayatthagaminiya pannaya with the preceding ajjhattam yeva sati supatthita hoti. Ce puts a comma .after hoti and no punctuation after pannaya, thus connecting dhammanam udayatthagaminiya pannaya with the followiiig asubhMnupassi kaye viharati. This, how­ ever, connects the meditation on the body's unattractive nature with the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, a con­ nection that, to my knowledge, is not made elsewhere in the Nikayas (apart from the repetitive refrain in the Satipatthana Sutta). ‘ . 1126 Sn 386 suggests that akalacari refers to walking for alms at an improper time. 1127 On contentment, see p. 1600, note 55. 1128 Mp explains parikuppa as "something with an irritating nature, similar to an old wound'' (parikuppanasabhdvd purdnavanasadisa). More commonly these acts are known as the dnantariya kamma, grave deeds that bring as their immediate result a rebirth in hell. See 6:93. 1129 Disaster regarding virtuous behavior (sllavyasana) obviously refers to conduct that violates the five ethical precepts, and disas­ ter regarding view (ditthivyasana) to the adoption of a wrong view, particularly the view that denies the principle of kamma and its results. 1130 Dhammen'eva cakkam vatteti.

###### Notes to the Fives 1739

 1144 This mode of practice is explained at Patis II 212-13, where it is called the psychic potency of the noble ones (ariy'iddhi), The fol­ lowing explanations of Mp are drawn from that source: (1) "Per­ ceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive (appatikule patikillasanm): He observes a desirable object with the idea of its unattractiveness or he attends to it as impermanent. (2) Perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive (patikUle appatikulasanm): He observes an undesirable object with loving-kindness or attends to it by way of elements. (3-4) In the third and fourth sections, he applies respectively the first and second methods to both kinds of objects. (5) To dzvell equanimous (upekkhako vihareyya): this is the six-factored equa­ nimity [that is, equanimity regarding the six sense objects] simi- . lar to that of an arahant In this sutta, insight is explained in the five cases. It is possible for a bhikkhu who has initiated insight to do this; it is also possible for a knowledgeable, wise, and learned person to do this. The stream-enterer, once-returner, and non- returner definitely, can do this; there is no need to say anything about the arahant." 1145 Md me kvacini katthaci kincana rajaniyesu dhammesu rago udapadi, md me kvacini katthaci kincana dosamyesu dhammesu doso udapadi, md me kvacini katthaci kincana mohaniyesu dhammesu rnoho udapadi. The formulation here seems deliberately stronger and more com­ prehensive than in the previous cases. Mp glosses: KvacanT ti kisminci drammane. K atthaci ti kisminci padese. Kincana ti koci . appamattakopi. 1146 Anagamanaditthiko deti. Mp: "One gives without having brought forth the view of arrival thus: The fruit of what has been done will arrive/" Presumably the view of kamma and its result is intended. 1147 Agdmanaditihiko. Mp: ."He gives with faith in kamma and its result." 1148 Samayavimuttassa bhikkhuno.

###### 1154 This is Laludayl, often depicted as a presumptuous monk. Thus the Buddha's words to follow should probably be read as a reproach to him for prematurely setting himself up as a teacher. Other examples of Udayl's rashness are at 3:80 and 5:166. At 6:29 and again at MN 136.6, III 208,25-31, he is reproached by the Buddha. In the Vinaya Pitaka a certain Udayi is depicted as a licentious monk whose misbehavior in sexual matters was responsible for the laying down of several sanghadisesa rules, but it is questionable whether he is identical with this Udayi. He may even have been a fictional character, a "John Doe" used to account for the origin of these rules. 1155 Anupubbikatham kathessami.

###### 1157 Yattha bhikkhuno uppanno aghato sabbaso pativinetabbo. I interpret this following Mp, which explains: "When resentment has arisen in a bhikkhu in regard to some object (yattha arammane), it should be completely dispelled there in these five ways." Thus Mp takes yattha to mean the person toward whom the resentment has arisen, not .the physical place where it has arisen. 1158 Labhati ca kalena kalam cetaso vivaram cetaso pasadam. Mp: "From time to time he gains an opening of the mind, that is, an oppor­ tunity arises in his mind for serenity and insight, and he gains placidity, which consists in the achievement of faith" (kale kale samathavipassanacittassa uppannokasasankhatam vivaranceva saddhasampannabhavasafikhatam pasadanca labhati). 1159 Samantapasadikam avuso puggalam agamma citlam pasTdati. This is apparently referring to the fifth type of person. Since his behavior and mind are both pure, one can easily dispel resentment toward him and settle down into a state of trust and tranquility. 1160 Mp: " The devas that subsist on edible food (kabalikaraharabhakkhanam devanan): the deities of the senke sphere. A certain mind-made group (annataram manomayam kayan): a certain group of brahmas 1 in the pure abodes, who are reborn by the jhana-mind." 1161 Ye te, bhante, deva arupino sannamaya. Udayi has confused the devas of the formless realm, who are said to be perception-made (sannamaya), with the devas of the form realm (including the pure abodes), who are said to be mind-made (manomaya). 1162 I read with Ce and He mayam te na pucchama, as against Be may am

It seems strange that the text uses the word kupita to refer to being reproved at the proper time.

Perhaps the last . two can be comprised.under patibhunapatiscimbhida. Mp explains five types of sequence: sequence of meaning (atthapubbapara), sequence of Dhamma (dhammapubbapara), sequence of syllables (akkharapubbapara), sequence of phrasing (byaiijanapubbapara), and sequence of sections within a sutta (anusandhipubbapara). 1167 I prefer Ce te santanneva sukhita sukham patisamvedenti to Be and Ee te santamyeva tusita sukham pativedenti. 1168 Sameti kho idam ayasmato bhaddajissa, yadidam bahujanena.

 punnatn gavesantassa. Jigimsati is desiderative of jayati, here with the sense "to wish to obtain." 1177 The verses to follow are identical with those of 3:57. 1178 Here and just below I read with Ce anuttaram vimuttisukham. Be and Ee have anuttaram vimuttim. 1179 Pdpiccho icchdpakato. arahiiiko hoti. Mp: "He thinks, 'While I am living in the forest, they will honor me with the four requisites, thinking I'm a forest dweller. They will esteem me for my vir­ tues, thinking that I'm conscientious and secluded, and so forth.' Thus he is a forest dweller based on. evil desire, because he is . overcome by desire." ■ - 1180 Ce follows this with a sutta on "these five who live solely on food gathered on alms round" (pane ime. bhikkhave pindapatika), riot included in Be and Ee. I here follow the latter, as Ce expands the vagga to an irregular eleven suttas. All these ascetic practices are explained in detail in Vism, chap. 2. Of.those below that are not . self-explanatory, the "sitter's practice" is sleeping, in the sitting posture, without lying down; the "any-bed-user's practice" is accepting any sleeping place that is offered, without preferences; the "one-session practice" is eating all one's food for the day in one sitting posture, without consuming any food after one has risen from one's seat; and the "later-food-refuser's practice" is refusing to accept any food that may be offered and made avail­ able after one has started one's meal. 1181 Reading here with Be sampiyen'eva samvasam sambandhaya sampa- vattenti. Ce and Ee have samsaggatthaya for sambandhaya. Mp (Be) seems to support the Be reading with its paraphrase: piyo piyarn upasahkamitva paveniyd bandhanattham samvasam pavattayanti. Mp (Ce) has ganthanattham for bandhanattham. Sambandhaya is glossed paveniyd, which may signify the continuity of the family. 1182 Be reads: . . . sampiyenapi samvasarn sambandhaya sampavattenti, which seems incomplete. Ee is similar in. this respect. I fol­ low Ce in positing here two contrasting clauses:. - .sampi­ yenapi samvasam samsaggatthdyh sampavattenti, asampiyenapi samvasam samsaggatthaya sampavattenti, but I would replace Ce samsaggatthaya with Be sambandhaya. 1183 This seems to have been a common criticism of the Buddha. See too 4:22 and 8:11. 1184 Komarabrahmacariyam. Presumably this means the celibacy of one who has always been a virgin. 1185 This passage suggests, contrary to a common assumption, that during the Buddha's time brahmins were not obliged to marry

###### the norm for brahmins during the prime of life, it seems that in this period some brahmins, after completing their training, chose to renounce secular life even in their youth and maintained their renunciant status throughout their lives. On celibate brahmin ascetics, see Samuel 2008:122-23,154-65. 1186 Cattaro brahmavihare bhavetva. This is one of the few places in the Nikayas where the word brahmavihara is used to designate these four meditations collectively. Wherever the word is used in the Nikayas, it immediately precedes the practitioner's rebirth in the brahma world. 1187 I read with Ce and Ee asucipatipito, as against Be asucipatiplUto, "would be oppressed by the impure substance." 1188 Ce and Ee read: Sace dona brahmano anutunim gacchati, tassa sa. hoti brahmam n'eva kamattha na davattha na ratattha, pajatthava brahmanassa brahmani hoti. This reading, it seems, joins the prem­ ise of the hypothetical to the consequence of the alternative (that is, when the brahmin has relations with his wife only when she is in season). I follow Brahmali's suggestion to delete sace dona brahmano anutuniin gacchati, which leaves a text that makes good sense. Be does not have the question about why the brahmin couples with a woman only when she is in season, but follows ■ the statement that he does not couple with a nursing woman with the words: tassa sa hoti brahmam n'eva kamattha na davattha
 ■na ratattha, pajatthava brahmanassa brahmani hoti. It seems that, in this readings a clause has been lost. 1189 Reading with Be and Ee pajatthapi, as against Ce na pajatthava. 1190 I assume the text (in all three editions) should be corrected to read na kevalam bhikkhacariy&ya rather than kevalam. pi bhikkhacariyaya. 1191 Also at SN 46:55, V 121-26, but with a section on the seven factors of enlightenment. 1192 Mp interprets the escape from the hindrances by way of the threefold escape. In relation to the hindrance of sensual desire, escape by suppression (vikkhambhananissarana) occurs through the first jhana based on the unattractive nature of the body, escape in a particular respect (tadanganissarana) through insight, and escape by eradication (samucchedanissarana) through the path of arahantship (broadly interpreting kamacchanda as craving for any object), (ii) The escape from ill will occurs by suppres­ sion through the first jhana based on loving-kindness, and by eradication through the path of the non-returner, (iii) The escape from dullness and drowsiness occurs by suppression through the perception of light (the visualization of a bright light) and by

###### 1744 T h e A h g u t t a r a N i k a y a

 from restlessness and remorse occurs by suppression through serenity— remorse being then eradicated through the path of the non-returner and restlessness through the path of arahantship. And (v) the escape from doubt occurs by suppression through the defining of phenomena (dhammavavatthana; see Vism 587-93, Ppn 18.3-24) and by eradication through the path of stream- entry. Mp does not apply "escape in a particular respect" to the last four hindrances, but Mp-t says it occurs in that the hin­ drances can be dispelled by reflection (patisahkhanavasena tassa vinodetabbataya tadahganissaranampi labbhat'eva). 1193 Mp interprets these terms from a monastic perspective. One's own-good (attattha) is arahantship, arid the-good of others (parattha) is the welfare of the lay supporters who provide one . with material support (because the offering of such gifts creates merit). 1194 Mp explains that after rising early, he had new gates, a watch- tower,, and ramparts built and had those that had decayed repaired.. 1195. Mp identifies Pirigiyani as a brahmin Who was a noble disciple . established in the fruit of non-returning (anagamiphale patitthitam ariyasavakam brahmanam). His daily routine was to visit the Bud­ dha and offer him incense and garlands. At the time the sutta begins, he was returning from his daily visit. 1196 For some reason, he cites only four of the nine divisions of the Dhamma. Perhaps it was only these with which he was familiar, or perhaps this implies a later provenance for the others. 1197 Patibhatu tarn pihgiydnl. Lit., "Let it shine upon you, Pirigiyani." 1198 At SN 3:12, I 81, this verse is spoken by the lay follower Candanarigalika, who also recites it after being moved by a sud­ den surge of inspiration. In the verse, Ariglrasa is an epithet of the Buddha. 1199 The following as at 5:143 above.

Brahmali suggests here: "This was the first great dream that was beneficial for his awakening," again with a parallel construc­ tion for the corresponding sections below.

###### sentence, but the question would then arise what abhisambodhaya relates to in §§2—4, where samma sambodhi does not occur. I find the sentence is more intelligible if we read tassa (as in the fol­ lowing sections), taking it to mean "to him," that is, to the future Buddha. We can then see the whole sentence as affirming that the dream was indicative of his imminent awakening. 1202 Ce and Be yattha nemittanam cakkhu na kamati (Ee na kkhamati). The Pali itself mixes metaphors. 1203 Pabbajita. Elsewhere I have usually rendered pabbajita as "one who has gone forth," and occasionally as "monk." Here, to avoid an unwieldy "virtuous ones who have gone forth," and to keep the rendering gender-neutral, I use "monastics." "Home" ren­ ders kula, lit. "family," but in this context the former better con­ veys the sense. 1204 Nissaramya dhatuyo. Mp glosses nissaramya with visamyutta, "detached, disconnected," and dhatuyo w ith attasunnasabhava, "a nature empty of self." 1205 Mp: "Having emerged from jhana on an unattractive object, he sends his mind in the direction of sensual pleasures for the pur­ pose of investigating them, just as one might take an antidote, for the purpose of investigating a poison." Mp-t: "Such a bhik­ khu does not attend to sensual pleasures in the sense [that he is overcomel by the defilement. Rather, he investigates: 'My mind is now fixed in renunciation. Why do sensual thoughts arise?'" 1206 Though all three editions here read vimuccati, Mp glosses the word with adhimuccati. The latter makes better sense to me. The manuscript traditions, as well as printed editions, show irregular variations between these two readings throughout the Nikayas. 1207 I read with Ce and Be sugatam, as against Ee sukatam. The former has the support of Mp, which glosses "well departed because it has gone into the object" (gocare gatatta sutthu gatam). I believe, however, that the sense of sugatam is that the mind has gone away from the defilement, which ties up better with the notion of escape (nissarana). 1208 Na so tarn vedanam vediyati. Mp: "He does not feel that sensual feeling or that distressful and feverish feeling." 1209 Be and Ee read veluvane, Ce niceluvane. Mp (Be) has niculavane in the lemma, glossed as mucalindavane. Both PED and SED list nicula as a kind of tree, identified as Barringtoriia acutangula. 1210 It cannot be determined from the language of the text whether Kimbila's questions and the Buddha's replies refer to the general conditions under which the teaching of a Buddha disappears, or

 will disappear. Mp seems to support the former interpretation. It explains that Kimbila had become a monk in the time of the past Buddha Kassapa, during an era when the latter's teaching was in decline. He now recollected this past life and wanted to inquire from the present Buddha about the cause for the decline of the Dhamma. Brahmali disagrees with me about this and writes: "This [translation] seems to assume that Kimbila is thinking in cosmic terms, about Tathagatas as a type of being. But it seems more likely to me that he was concerned specifically with what would happen after Gotama Buddha passed away." 1211 An expanded parallel of 4:112. 1212 As at MN 16.2-7, I 101. 1213 Cetokhila. in MLDB cetokhila was translated "wilderness of the heart," which is not satisfactory. According to DOP, khila means "barren land; hard, arid soil," and "(as a fault of one's think' ing) barrenness, sterility; stiffness, rigidity; hostility, resistance." Mp glosses: "Rigidity, waste, stumps of the mind" (citiassa thaddhabhava kacavarabhava.khan'ukabhava). 1214 As at MN 16.8-12,1 101-2. 1215 Cetaso vinibandha. Mp: "They grasp the mind, having shack­ led it as if in a fist, therefore they are called 'bondages of. the mind'" (cittam vinibandhitva mutthiyam katva viya ganhanti ti cetaso vinibandha). 1216 Dantakatthassa akhadane, lit. "in not chewing on toothwood." In the Buddha's time people cleaned their teeth by brushing them with sticks of medicinal wood such as neem, sharpened at one end and made brush-like at the base. This practice is still observed in rural India as well as in monasteries in southern Asia. 1217 Ayatakena gltassarena dhammam hhanantassa.

Mp explains that he has cut off the world- transcending outlet (lokuttarapafipanthassa chinnatta chinnapari­ pantho), but possibly what is meant is that, having committed a parajika, which requires expulsion from the Sangha, he has no way to preserve his status as a bhikkhu. 1220 Annataram sankilittham apattim apajjati. This sometimes means that he commits a parajika or a sanghadisesa offense, but since a parajika was just mentioned, it must refer to a sanghadisesa. 1221 Verabahulo.

###### 1222 The exact meaning of pasldati cannot easily be captured by a single English word. "To be confident" normally suggests to be poised and self-confident, which is not what is meant. SED gives as meanings of Skt pra-sad, pra-sTdati, "to settle down, grow clear and bright, become placid or tranquil; . . . to become satisfied or pleased or glad." SED renders the causative pra-sadayati: "to make clear, purify; to make serene, gladden (the heart); to ren­ der calm, sooth, appease." Of these meanings, "to gladden, to please" partly captures the impact that pasadika conduct has on others; becoming “gladdened" or "pleased" is how an observer might favorably respond to such conduct. But such conduct also awakens in others trust in oneself as a spiritually refined person and inspires confidence in the teaching one follows. Thus such conduct "inspires confidence" in others. When one's behavior or attitudes act reflexively upon oneself, one "becomes serene (or placid)," which is the best way to render the sense of the verb pasidati. ' . 1223 The capital of the state of Suraseha, situated on the Yamuna River in northern India. It later became an important center for the Mulasarvastivadins. Though the text makes the Buddha say he did not.like the place, one wonders whether this sutta might be an interpolation inserted by the Vibhajjavadins to denigrate the headquarters of their rival Buddhist school. 1224 Dighacarikam anavatthacarikam. Mp glosses the latter with avavalthitacdrikam, perhaps "undetermined (or purposeless) wandering." The contrast is with samavatthacare just below, glossed samavatthitacare, "evenly determined wandering." 1225 The first four are violations, respectively, of Pacittiyas 46,45,44, and 7. 1226 On the defiled offense, see p. 1733, note 1089. 1227 Ussurabhatte kule. llssura is from Skt ut'siira (SED: "the time when the sun sets, the evening"). Mp glosses "a meal cooked late in the day" (atidwapacanabhatte). 1228 Samayabhatte kule. To suit ascetics and brahmins who "abstain from meals outside the proper time," the food would need to be ready well before midday. 1229 See pp. 60-61, for a discussion of rnisogynistic passages in AN. 1230 The first two "dangers" are evidently taken to be self- explanatory. 1231 Dhammadassane niveseti. Mp: "He establishes them in the seeing of the Dhamma of the four [noble] truths." 1232 Arahaggatam ayasmanto satim upatthapetha. Mp: "Establish respect for the three bases [of faith], gone [for refuge] only to the Triple

 1234 The ellipsis points in the Pali may give the impression that in §3
 and §4 the devoted person loses confidence in bhikkhus. How­ ever, since the person in whom he had confidence was not penal- ized in any way by other bhikkhus, it is clear that the statement about the devoted person losing his confidence in bhikkhus does not pertain to these two sections. That is, the continuation of §5 should be applied retroactively to §3 and §4 as well. He does not associate with other bhikkhus, not out of resentment toward them, but simply because.of the exclusivity of his trust

 thus translate the sutta titles at the head of each sutta in Ce. 1236 For various sets of five qualities that entitle a monk to give full ordination, to give dependence, and to have a novice attend on him, see Vin I 62-65: 1237 On nissaya, see pp. 1732—33, note 1085. 1238 Ce and Ee patik'ittham. Be patikuttham, past participle of patikkosati. 1239 I follow the arrangement of Be and Ee. Ce places the two versions on the jhanas before the two versions on the four fruits. 1240 Vaggdtirekasuttani. This is the title Ce assigns to this entire con­ cluding section. Be does not assign a general title but classifies these extra suttas into three "repetition series" (peyyala), num­ bered 1, 2, and 3. The first, referring to the first sutta in each set, is called Sammutipeyydlam, "Agreed Upon Repetition Series." I use both the general title of Ce and the separate series titles of Be. Ee does not give any separate title to this section, whether to the whole or to its separate series. 1241 Bhattuddesaka. See Vin II175,36-76. The procedures for appointing officials of the Sangha, and their respective tasks, are discussed in detail in Thanissaro 2007b: 323-57. 1242 I translate in accordance with Be and Ee. A translation from Ce would read: "Bhikkhus, one possessing five qualities should not be appointed an assigner of meals. If he is appointed, he should not be sent." 1243 Sendsanapafindpaka. On his qualifications, see Vin II 176,9-14. Dabba Mallaputta's duties as senasanapafinapaka are described at Vin III 158-60. The qualifications of the officers to follow here, except the next, are described at Vin I I 176-77.

###### Thanissaro, too, observes (2007b: 340): “The Canon allows for two officials related to lodgings: the lodging bestower (senasana- gahapaka) and the lodging assignor (senasana-pannapanaka). Nei­ ther the Canon nor Commentary clearly distinguishes between the duties of the two/' 1245 Abrahmacan hoti. Though modeled after the five lay precepts, the third item in this list lays down the more stringent requirement of celibacy for male and female monastics. 1246 Abrahmacariya pativirato hoti. 1247 Kamesu micchacarinl. For the lay Buddhist the rule of celibacy incumbent on monastics is changed to abstaining from sexual misconduct (kamesu micchacara). 1248 A sect of ascetics contemporary with the Buddha. Makkhali Gosala is regarded as their founder, or perhaps simply one of their prominent teachers.. While the text stipulates conditions for the lion-Buddhist ascetics to go to hell, it mentions none that will enable them to be reborn in heaven. 1249 In regard to the magandika and the following; Mp says only that they are types of sectarians (titthiya). I am uncertain which of these terms designate a specific religious school and which des­ ignate only a mode of practice. Hence I use initial capitals only for those that are known to designate religious schools contem­ porary with the Buddha. 1250 Be gives the final number as 1151, but the sum total of suttas in this peyyala should be 850: five major sections, taken by ten modes of treatment (direct knowledge, full understanding, etc.) in relation to seventeen defilements (lust, hatred, etc.). Thus, starting at 303, the final number should be 1152.

 N otes to the Sixes

 1251 N'eva sumano hoti na dummano, apekkhako viharati sato sampajano. Mp: "Neither joyful nor saddened: [filled ] with joy accompanied by lust in regard to a desirable object. Nor [is he] saddened: [filled] with sadness accompanied by aversion in regard to an undesir­ able object. But [he] dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly com­ prehending: He is not equanimous because he lias fallen into the 'equanimity of unknowing' (annan 'upekkha) through apathy in the case of a neutral object; but rather, being mindful and clearly comprehending,he maintains neutrality in relation to the object. In this sutta, the constant dwelling of an arahant is discussed." 1252 For details on the first five mundane direct knowledges, see Vism chaps. 12 and 13.

 1254 Elaborated below at 6:30. 1255 Elaborated just below at 6:10 and again at 6:25. 1256 Ariyasavako agataphalo vinfiatasasano. Mp says that Mahanama is asking about the stream-enterer's vital support (sotapannassa nissayaviharam). 1257 The six recollections to follow are commented on in detail in Vism chap. 7. 1258 Visamagataya pajaya samappatto. Mp: "Among beings who have become unbalanced (visamagatesu) through lust, hatred, and delusion, he has attained peace and calmness (samam upasamam patto hutva)." From this, it is obvious that Mp takes Pali sama to be equivalent to Skt sama, peace. But since the text establishes a contrast between visama, the. imbalance (or unrighteousness) in which ordinary people live, and the sama that the noble disciple has attained, it is more likely that Pali sama corresponds to Skt sama. Two Chinese parallels support this supposition. SA2 156, at T II 432ci5-i6, has .<■ ("Whether his enemies or his relatives, toward these two types of people he has no thought of hostility but his.mind is balanced"). The other, T 1537.8 at T XXVI 492c 13-15, has » f #
**0** **0** **("Amid unbalanced sentient**
###### beings, he obtains balance; among afflicted sentient beings he dwells without affliction"). Though contradicting the interpreta­ tion of sama offered by Mp, this confirms the evident meaning of the sutta. 1259 Dhammasotam samapanno. Mp: "He has entered the stream of the Dhamma consisting in insight." Since the Pali expression can easily be contracted to sotapanna, I do not see why Mp inter­ prets dhammasota as insight (vipassana) rather than the noble path (ariyamagga). In SN 55:5, at V 347,24-25, sota is used as a metaphor . for the noble eightfold path. 1260 The first six are the deities of the six sense-sphere heavens. The devas of Brahma's company (brahmalmyika deva) are the deities of the brahma world. The "devas still higher than these" are the higher devas in the form and formle;ss realms. 1261 Dhamma saramya. Mp explains saramyd as if it meant "fit to be remembered" (saritabbayuttaka), but Edgerton, in BHSD (p. 593), regards, samranjana, samranjamya, "courteous, pleasing, polite, friendly," as the correct Skt equivalent. Five of these are at 5:105, where they are called "means of dwelling at ease" (phasuvihara). 1262 Appativibhattabhogl. Mp explains that there are two kinds of reservation (dve pativibhattdni), regarding things and regarding


-----

_N o t e s t o t h e S ix e s_ **1751**

###### to give away so much and keep so much for oneself. Reservation regarding persons means that one decides to give to one person but not to another. The bhikkhu described here does not make ei ther of these reservations. 1263 Nissaranlya dhatuyo. Compare 5:200, which describes a different set of "elements of escape." 1264 Arati. This word usually signifies dissatisfaction with the life of renunciation. 1265. This text uses the word raga, which in this context probably means personal bias rather than sensual desire. Interestingly, at MN I 424,33-34, upekkha is opposed to patigha, aversion, the polar opposite of raga. Given that upekkha is a state of inner poise beyond both attraction and repulsion, it is not surprising to find it offered as the antidote to.the two opposed qualities. 1266 Animitta cetovimutti. Mp: "The marHess liberation of mind, strong insight (balavavipassana). But.the reciters of the Digha Nikaya say it is the meditative attainment of the fruit of arahantship (arahattaphalasamapatti); for that is said to. be markless because it lacks the marks of lust, etc., the marks of form, etc., and the marks of permanence, etc. (sahi raganimittadinanc’eva rupanimittadlnahca niccanimittadinanca abhava animitta ti vutta). 1267 ■ Nimittanusarl. Mp: "Follozvs after marks: follows along with the - aforesaid marks." The "aforesaid marks" are those mentioned in the preceding note. 1268 In the standard correlation between stages of attainment and removal of defilements, doubt and bewilderment along with the view "This I am" are eliminated with the attainment of stream- entry, and the conceit "I am" with the attainment of arahantship (see SN 22:89, III 126-32). In the present passage, the persistence . of doubt is taken as a criterion for determining that someone has not removed the conceit "I am." 1269 Viharam kappeti. Lit., "arranges his dwelling." Kappeti, as sug­ gesting a Way to pass time, occurs in such expressions as jwitam kappeti, "to make a living," vasam kappeti, "to make a dwelling, to dwell," nisajjam kappeti, "to take a seat, to sit down," etc. 1270 Na bhaddalcam maranam hoti, no bhaddika kalakiriya. Pali often pairs two words for death, marana and kalakiriya. Since such a manner of expression sounds odd in English, I use one word. Mp says that what is meant by "not a good death" is rebirth in the plane of misery (apaye patisandhim ganhati). 1271 Kammaramo hoti kammarato kdmmaramatam anuyutto. In this con­ text, kamma means construction work, common at monaster­ ies, such as putting up new buildings and renovating existing


-----

###### 1272 Papancaramo hoti papancarato papancdramatam anuyutto. Mp says: "Proliferation is the proliferation of defilements, occurring by way of craving, views, and conceit and inducing intoxication" (papanco ti tan haditthimanavasena pavatto madanakarasanthito kilesa- papanco). For more on papanca, see pp. 1710-11, note 881. 1273 Sakkaya. Mp: "The round of existence with its three planes" (tebhumakava tta ni). 1274 Mago. Lit., "a beast." Mp: "One like a beast" (magasadiso). 1275 Sapekkho. Mp glosses this with satanho, "with craving," but I believe the intended meaning is more likely to be "with anxiety, with worry, with sorrow." Pali apekkha, like "concern," can mean both attachment and worry. 1276 Mp says that since she was not able to cure his illness with medi- . cine, she roared this "lion's roar" (sihanada) to cure his illness by a declaration of truth (saccakiriya). 1277 I read with Ce varam, as against Be and Ee gharam. Mp: "will take another husband" (annam samikam ganhissati). See SED sv . vara2: "'chooser/ one who solicits a girl in marriage, suitor, lover, . bridegroom, husband." 1278 Gahatthakam brahmacariyarn. It is not unusual in traditional Bud­ dhist cultures for devout couples who have begotten several children to mutually agree to observe celibacy. 1279 Since the structure of this section is parallel to the two that fol­ low rather than to the three that precede it, it is evident that mam'accayena does not belong here. Though the expression is in all three printed editions, a Sinhala-script manuscript noted in Ee omits it. Like the two following sections, this one does not have a future verb bhavissati. Further, parallel to the next two sections, Nakulamata here asserts that she presently fulfills virtuous behavior, referring one who doubts this to the Bud­ dha. Hence, since Nakulamata is speaking about a current fact, there is no need for her to refer to a time when her husband has passed away. Mp says that §§4-6 are Nakulamata's declaration of truth. 1280 Na . .. imasmim dhammavinaye ogadhappatta patigadhappatta assa- sappatta. These are all ways of assorting that she is at minimum a stream-enterer- It is interesting that she claims to have obtained a foothold in the dhammavinaya, which suggests that in certain contexts vinaya bears a wider meaning than the code of monastic regulations. 1281 Yavadattham seyyasukham passasukham middhasukham anuyutto viharanto. At 5:206 this is called a mental bondage (cetaso vinibandha). 1282 Also at 5:56.


-----

###### 1283 It is interesting to note that mindfulness of death culminates in the deathless. 1284 Mp explains the opening exclamation, aho vata, as an indeclinable expressive of longing (patthanatthe nipato). Brahmali rejects Mp's interpretation and regards the sentence as an emphatic statement of fact, which he renders: "Indeed, I may live just a night and a day; I should attend to the Blessed One's teaching." The Chinese parallel, EA 40.8 (T I 741c26-742b2), is in substantial agreement with Mp. Thus the first monk to speak (at T 1742a2-3) says: "When I contemplate.death, I wish to go on living for seven days [and] contemplate the seven factors of enlightenment. This would be very beneficial [to me] in regard to the Tathagata's teaching [and] . after death I will have no regrets" °

 1285 Bahum vata me katam assa. Mp: "T could accomplish much in my task with respect to the teaching'" (sasane mama kiccam bahu katam assa). Mp-t: "I would accomplish much in my task as a monk, which would be beneficial to me/' 1286 Mp-t: "A single alms meah a single alms meal able to sustain him for a single day." The point of the Pali locution tadantaram . .. yadantaram is not that he wants to live long enough to eat a single meal, but that, aware of the uncertainty of death's arrival, he wants .to live for the length of time it takes to eat a single meal so that he can practice the Dhamma. In other words, if it takes twenty minutes to silently eat a meal, this is the length of time he hopes to live. 1287 Rattiya patihitaya. Patihita (or patihita)-is not in PED; see SED sv prati-dha. It is the past participle of patidahati, meaning "to com­ mence, to begin, to approach," which seems relevant here. Mp glosses with patipannaya. 1288 I read with Be parihayamane, as against Ce and Ee parihandya samvattamane. 1289 These eight lines are also at 3:36. Here all three editions read te khemappatta in pada a of the final verse. 1290 The text uses the singular himavantam pabbatarajam. To conform to‘ordinary English usage I translate himavantam as "the Hima­ layas," despite apparent tension between the plural object and the singular "the king of mountains." 1291 Mp: "He is skilled in the attainment of concentration (samadhissa samdpattikusalo): he is skilled in entering concentration, hav­ ing comprehended what kind of food and climate is suitable. Skilled in the duration of concentration (samadhissa thitikusalo): he is able to stabilize concentration. Skilled in emergence (samadhissa vutthanakusalo): he is able to emerge at the predetermined time.

 able to gladden the mind for concentration, to make it fit. Skilled in the area [or resort) of concentration (samadhissa gocarakusalo): hav­ ing avoided those things that are unsuitable and unhelpful for concentration, pursuing those that are suitable and helpful, he knows, 'This concentration takes a mark as its object; this one takes a characteristic as its object.' Skilled in resolution regard­ ing concentration (samadhissa abhimhdrakusalo): in order to enter higher and higher meditative attainments, he is able to direct
 [the mind] to the concentration of the first jhana and so. forth:" Mp-t adds more information on these skills: "Skilled in fitness: able to make the mind enter [concentration] by removing the. states that are opposed and by evenly applying the collabora­ tive causes of concentration. Skilled in the area: skilled in what is to be done to produce concentration; skilled in the place where it occurs, namely, the meditation subject; and skilled in yoking mindfulness arid clear comprehension to the area for going on alms round. Skilled in resolution: able to direct or lead [the mind] to the concentration of the first jhana, etc., because they pertain to distinction." For more on the skills needed to master concent tration, see 7:40-41 and SN chap. 34. 1292 Mp glosses anussatitthanani with anussatikaranani, "causes of recollection," on which Mp-t says: "The recollections are them­ selves 'causes of recollection' in that they function as the cause . (hetubhdvato) for the welfare and happiness pertaining to this present life and the future life." 1293 Idampi kho bhikkhave arammanam karitva. In the Nikayas the word arammana does not yet mean "object of consciousness" in the general sense, as it does in the Abhidhamma and commentaries. Occasionally in the Nikayas arammana may signify an. object of meditation, but this role is usually taken by nimitta, which does not necessarily mean the "counterpart sign" as it does in the commentaries. I do not interpret the present text to be saying that one takes the recollection of the Buddha as an object, but that one makes it a basis, or starting point, for departing from greed. For this, I draw support from IsJlp-t, which glosses arammanam karitva thus: "Having made it a condition, having made it a foun­ dation" (paccayam karitva pddakamkatvd). Mp-t takes "this" (idam) in the iemma above to be the access Concentration (upacarajjhdna) obtained by recollection of the Buddha. Mp explains "are puri­ fied" (visujjhanti) to mean "they attain final nibbana, the supreme purity." 1294 Mp: "In the midst of confinement (sambadhe): amid confinement

There is no difference in the meaning. 1296 Manobhdvaniyassa bhikkhi-ino dassanaya upasahkamitum. The com­ mentaries consistently e-xplain manobhdvaniyd to mean "those who increase esteem,'' or "those worthy of esteem," rather than "those who have developed the mind." Thus Spk II 250,1-2 says those bhikkhus are mano>bhdvanlyd "who, when seen, make the . mind grow in the wholesome" (yesuhiditthesu kusalavasena cittam . vaddhati). 1297. Yam nimittam dgamma yam nimittam manasikaroto anantara asavdnam khayo hoti. On th_e "immediate destruction of the taints/' see p. 1705, note 851. 1298 Mp: "On that occasion wbien he is sitting in his daytime dwelling it occurs in his mind door."" 1299 Adhicittam, Mp: "The mind of concentration and insight." The bhikkhu Udayi (Laludayl) often blunders in his explanation of doctrinal points and is tl-aea reproached by the Buddha. 1300 Ironically, this may be the only place in the Nikayas where three jhanas are referred to as an anussatitthdna, "subject of recollec­ tion." Neither text nor Mp offers an explanation why the fourth jhana is set off as a separate subject of recollection, the fifth here. In fact, the use of the designation anussatitthdna for the five con­ templations mentioned foy Ananda, and the sixth added by the Buddha, seems unique to this sutta. 1301 Yatha diva tathd rattim, yntha rattim tathd diva. Also at 4:41. Mp explains: "As by day he attends to the perception of light, just so does he attend to it at night. As at night he attends to the perception of light, just so does he attend to it during the day. Obtaining knowledge and 'vision: this is obtaining the divine eye, called knowledge and vision." 1302 Here and below are the nine charnel ground contemplations, as in the Satipatthana Sutta, at DN 22.7-10, II295-97; MN 10.12-30, 158-59. 1303 This must be referring to the fourth jhana as the basis for the six kinds of direct knowledge. 1304 In Pali: dassananuttariyccm, savananuttariyam, labhanuttariyam, sikkhanuttariyam, paricariyanuttariyam, anussatanuttariyam. 1305 Patisanthdra. At 2:152 it is said that there are two kinds of hospi­ tality: with material things and with the Dhamma. 1306 These last three perceptions are explained at 10:60 §§5-7.


-----

###### 1307 Acamayitvana. Mp explains this literally: one washes one's hands and feet and cleans one's mouth. 1308 Natthi attakaro, natthi parakaro. Lit., "There is no self-doing, there is no other-doing." The Buddha refutes him just below by point­ ing out the obvious fact that the brahmin has come of his own free will (sayam) and will depart of his own free will. 1309 Arambhadhatu. Mp: "The energy thatoccursby way of beginning
 [an activity]" (arabhanavasena pavattaviriyam). The next two ele­ ments mentioned just below, nikkamadhatu and parakkamadhatu, can be understood respectively as the energy heeded to persist in an action and to consummate it. The three are proposed as the antidote to dullness and drowsiness at 1:18 and SN 46:51, V 105,28-106,2, and as means of nurturing the enlightenment factor of energy at SN 46:2, V 6 6 ,9- 15, and SN 46:51, V 104,14-20. 1310 Mp does not differentia te the next three factors mentioned here— thamadhatu, thitidhatu, and upakkamadhatu—but says merely that they are various names for energy. . 1311 An expanded parallel of 5:201. 1312 See 5:30. Although the framework of the two suttas is the same, their content is so different that it is questionable whether the pres­ ent sutta can be considered an expanded parallel of the other. 1313 I read with Ce aramiko va samanuddeso va sahadhammiko va. Nei­ ther Be nor Ee includes sahadhairtmiko va. Be's reading here is very different: idan' imam ayasmantam aramiko va upatthahissati samanuddeso va tam tamha samadhimha cavessati; "Now a monas­ tery attendant or a novice will serve this venerable one, which will cause him to fall away from that concentration." Ee follows Be, but withghattessati, "strike against, offend, provoke," instead of upatthahissati. 1314 Aranfuisanfiamyeva manasi karissati ekattam. Mp: " Oneness: he will bring to mind just the perception of the forest, a one-pointed state of uniformity" (ekasabhavam, ekaggatabhutam arannasannam yeva citte karissati). The wording here is reminiscent of MN 121, III 104,20-2i: arannasannam paticca manasi karoti ekattam, "he attends to the oneness dependent on the, perception of the forest." 1315 Mp: "By this much, the Teacher has praised a forest lodging." 1316 The various applications of the word naga will be explained . just below. King's Pasenadi's buli elephant was called "Seta" ("White"') because its body was white. 1317 A pun is intended here. The Buddha's statement— agum na karoti—playfully derives the word naga from na + agum, "no evil." Naga thus becomes an epithet for the Buddha, or, more broadly, for any arahant. See Sn 527: Agum na karoti kind loke ... nago tadi pavuccate tathatta ("One who does no evil in the world


-----

###### ... the stable one is for such a reason called a naga"). See too Th 1249 (= SN.8 :8 , I 192,34): Naganamo'si bhagava ("You are named Naga, O Blessed One"). 1318 Mp identifies this LJdayl with Kaludayl. However, the same verses at Th 689-704 are ascribed simply to Udayl, while a different set of verses in Th (527—36) is ascribed to Kaludayl. This proves that Mp's identification of the poet cannot be correct. There is a Chi­ nese parallel of this sutta, MA 118 (at T I 608b2—609a3), which at several points proved helpful in my reading of the Pali verses. 1319 Reading with Be vana nibbanam agatam. Ce and Ee have nibbanam in place of nibbanam. Mp draws out the word play: "From the jungle of defilements, he has come to a clearing; he has reached nibbana, devoid of the jungle of defilements" (kilesavanatd - nibbanam kilesavanarahitam nibbanam agatam sampattam). It seems that Ce and Ee have transposed nibbana from the gloss into the text itself. The Chinese at T I 608c2 has "from the woods he has left the woods," which supports the Be reading. 1320 Saccanamc is not "one whose name is truth," but "one who is truly named," whose name truly corresponds to his being. Mp: "He is truly named, really named, accurately named 'naga'justbecause of not doing evil" (tacchanamo bhutanamo agum akaraneneva nagoti evam avitathanamo). The Chinese (at T I 608c7) has — M "he is the naga among all nagas, in truth the naga who is unsurpassed." 1321 There is a word play here between two meanings oicarana, "con­ duct, behavior" and "feet." Mp glosses: "They are the Buddha- naga's two hind feet." 1322 Satigwa siro panna vimamsa dhammacintana. I translate the terms quite literally. Mp, however, says: "The tip of the elephant's trunk is called investigation (vimamsa) because [it investigates] things to determine whether they are hard or soft, edible or inedible, etc. He then rejects whatever should be rejected and takes whatever should be taken. So, for the Buddha-naga, reflection on phenomena (dhammacintana)—referring to his knowledge that determines the classes of phenomena— is his [means of] investigation. With this knowledge he knows who is capable and who incapable." The Chinese at 608cn renders the line in a more straightforward way: "wisdom is his head, reflection on and discrimination of phenomena." 1323 In pada c I read samatapo with Be and Ee, as against Ce samavapo. Mp: "It is the concentration of the fourth jhana that is here called dhamma. For it is on this basis that the supernormal powers suc­ ceed. Therefore it is called balanced heat of the belly (kucchisamatapo).


-----

###### seclusion from the acquisitions (kayacittaupadhiviveko). As the elephant uses its tail to ward off mosquitoes, so the Tathagata resorts to seclusion to ward off householders and monks/' The Chinese reads the couplet (at 6 0 8 ci2) as jgjf tf "upholding dharmas is his.belly, and delight in seclusion is his pair of arms. -' Apparently in this transmission, valadhi of the Pali came down as bahuni. 1324 Assasa can mean both inhalation and consolation, the latter refer­ ring to arahantship. Mp says, that just a!s inhalation and exhala­ tion are what keeps the elephant alive, so fruition attainment (phalasamapatti) is essential to the Buddha; and it is there that he delights. 1325 Reading with Be loke viharati. Ce and Ee loke vimjjati means ''becomes detached in the world," which does not match the simile as well.
 ■ 1326 In place of sanklmresupasantesu in pada c (the reading of all triree editions), I read here with a pair of Burmese manuscripts (referred to in a note in Ee): angaresu ca saritesu, nibbutoti pavuc- cati. The reading is also found at Th 702. Vanarata points out that "the whole verse is the simile and nibbuto [meaning both an extinguished fire and a person who has attained nibbana] refers to the fire/' The Chinese (at 6 O8 C27), in agreement with Th and the Burmese manuscripts, has "Without firewood, the fire does not continue. This fire is then said to have ceased." 1327 Mp: "Other arahant nagas will know the Buddha-naga that was taught by the naga, the elder Udayi." Despite Mp, I suspect the text itself intends the Buddha himself as the one who taught about the naga. The Chinese (at 6O8C29) supports my suspicion: PftWL, "it was spoken by the naga among nagas."- 1328 Reading with Ee parinibbati 'nasavo, as against Ce and Be parinib- bissati anasavo. This verse completes the simile with the fire. The analogy is clearer in the Chinese (at 609a2), where "this naga is said to have attained nibbana," echoes 608c27, Jib^ClS Z-M, "this fire is said to have ceaspd." I have attempted to capture this effect by translating parinibbati twice, first as quenched and then in terms of its doctrinal meaning. 1329 I take the correct reading here to be Be sakadagamipatto (found, too, in Burmese manuscripts), as contrasted with Ce and Ee sakadagami satto. Confusion of s and p is not unusual in Sinhala- script manuscripts. However, the gloss in Mp, sakadagamipuggalo hutva, suggests that the commentator used a text with the read­ ing sakadagtiTni sattp. It is not impossible that the corruption (if it is one) dates back before the age of the commentaries

###### assigns petteyya is "showing filial piety toward one's father," which does not fit here. We should probably read here pettapiyo, which PED defines as "father's brother, paternal uncle." In the version at 10:75, Ce has petta pi yo and Ee petta piyo, which, by closing the spaces, would both give the desired reading. In MN 89.18, II 123,27-124,11, Purana and Isidatta are said to have been in the employment of King Pasenadi of Kosala but to have shown greater respect toward the Buddha than toward the king. Their love for the Buddha is expressed in SN 55:6, V 348-52. 1331 Mp: "Ananda said this becaiise he did not know the reason." Brahmali writes: "I Understand Ananda to simply be saying that it should be understood just as the Buddha explained it/', and he suggests rendering the sentence: "Just so, sister, as this was declared by the Blessed One." However, at this point the Buddha's pronouncements on their destiny have not yet been explained. The explanation comes only at the end of the sutta, when the Buddha extols the respective strong points of the two . deceased lay disciples, 1332 C.e ambakapanna; Be here has ammakasanna, "a woman's'per­ ception" or "a woman's idea," but the Be text of 10:75 reads ammakapanna. Ee has ambakasanna here but ambakapanna in the concluding paragraph. Apparently Ee's former reading, is a typographical error for the latter, since on the first occurrence sanna is cited as a variant in the notes. Again, the common s /p confusion must lie behind the variants. Ambaka in Ce and Ee (or Be ammaka) is derived from anima, "mother/' but with the more general meaning of women. Mp-t explains: "Ammaka (or ambaka) means women (lit., the class of mothers). This is a meta­ phorical term. That is, mothers, the class of mothers, mater­ nal parents, are found among women" (Ammakati matugamo. Upacaravacananh'etam. Itthisu yadidam arfimaka matugamo janam janika). SED sv amba has "a mother, good woman (as a title of respect)/' And under ambika: "mother, good woman (as a term of respect)." The Chinese parallel at TII 258cs-9, does not include the derogatory generalization about women, but states the mat­ ter with reference to Migasala as an individual: "The lay follower Migasala is foolish and has little wisdom" 1333 The juxtaposition of nominative ke with locative - nane is puz­ zling. 1 take the sense to be that those referred to by ke are estab­ lished in this knowledge. Perhaps, though, - nane is a residual eastern form, a nominative plural in agreement with ke. Mp does not attempt to resolve this problem, but when commenting on "in the knowledge of other persons as superior and inferior" (purisapuggalaparopariyanane), it explains this knowledge as "the

Mp says that he does not occa­ sionally gain rapture and joy derived from listening to the Dhamma. Patis II 4 0 ,16- 17, however, defines the near-synonym samayuvimokkho as the four jhanas and four formless attainments (cattari ca jhdndni, catassoca arupasamapattiyo, ay am samayavimok- kho, which it distinguishes from permanent emancipation, iden­ tified with the four noble paths, the four fruits of the spiritual life, and nibbana (cattaro ca ariyamaggd, cattari ca sdmannaphdlani, nibbdnanca, ayam asamayavimokkho): 1335 Text reads merely, tom hi tesam, -without specifying what tam refers to. Mp explains that it is the making of the: judgment (tam pamdnalairanam). . 1336 Imam puggalam dhammasotam nibbahati. Mp: "The knowledge of insight, occurring strongly, carries him along; it.conducts him to the plane of the noble ones.". 1337 Text has lobhadhammat "states of greed,-" which Mp glosses as "simply greed" (lobho'yeva). . 1338 I follow here the text of the printed Ce, with its elisions. The electronic Ce fills in the elisions incorrectly. 1339 Here and in §6 , 1 read with Ce vaclsamsdrd, which is also the read­ ing in Mp (Ce), Be and Ee have vactsahkhdfd. M p glosses: "Just utterances in addressing and conversing" (dldpasalldpavasena vacananeva). VacTsamsaro is at 2:63, where it refers to arguments between factions of monks. 1340 Mp: "Purana excelled in virtuous behavior, Isidatta in wisdom. Purana's virtuous behavior matched Isidattars superior wis­ dom; Isidatta's wisdom matched Purana's superior virtuous behavior." 1341 I have divided the stanzas as is done in Be, which I find more satisfactory than Ce. In Ee the lines of verse are not grouped into separate stanzas. 1342 All three editions read evam etam gahatthdnam cago punnam pavaddhati. The syntax is not satisfactory yet no variants are noted. Mp attempts to resolve the problem with its gloss, cagoti sahkham gatam punnam vaddhati, "merit which is designated 'generosity7 increases/’ but this is implausible. Could there have originally been an ablative cdgd here, or an instrumental cagcna (with the verb vaddhati, to support the meter), which was changed to cago by error? The Chinese parallel, MA 125, lends some support to this hypothesis at T I 614c2o: "because of generosity merit increases." 1343 Dhammayogd. Mp says this is a name for speakers on the Dhamma

###### {(ihammakathika), but it may refer to all those who adopt a pre­ dominantly cognitive approach to the Dhamma. The term seems to be unique to the present text. The distinction posited between meditators and those intent on Dhamma suggests a late origin, when vocations in the Sangha had bifurcated along these lines. 1344 Jhayanti pajjhayanti. The tone of this is derisive. Be uses a string of four verbs: jhayanti pajjhayanti nijjhayanti avajjhayanti. For a similar derisive use of verbs based on jhayanti, see 11:9, V 323,is; MN 50.13,1334,18-M. 1345 Amatam dhatum kayena phusitva viharanti. Mp: "This refers to the nibbana element, called 'the deathless' because it is devoid of death. Having taken up a meditation subject, in stages they dwell having touched it with the mental body." 1346 Gambtiiram.cittfiapadam pannaya ativijjha passanti. Mp: "The 'deep and pithy matter'includes the aiggregates, elements, sense bases, and so forth, which are subtle and hidden. They see this after . penetrating it with insight and path wisdom (sahavipassanaya maggapannaya)."- 1347 Moliyaslvaka is also at SN 36:21, IV 230—31, where he inquires from the Buddha whether all feeling is due to past kamma. 1348 On the "directly visible Dhamma" {sanditthiko dhammo), see too 3:53-54. 1349 Lobhadhamma. Similarly, just below, the text has dosadhamma and mohadhamma. Mp glosses as "the factors associated with it" (tamsampayuttadhamma). 1350 Kayasandosam, followed by vacisandosarn and manosandosam. Mp glosses the first as a faulty quality in the body-door (kayadvarassa dussanakaram). 1351 Both monks declare, in opposite ways, the arahant's eradication of the three modes of conceit: the superiority conceit, the inferior­ ity conceit, and the equality conceit. 1352 Attho ca vutto atta ca anupanito. A s at 3:72, IV 2.18,31, there seems to be a word play between attho and atta, "goal" and "self." 1353 Mp glosses ussesu as superior persons, omesu as inferior ones, and samatte as similar ones, explaining: "Arahants do not rank them­ selves, by way of conceit, as superior, inferior, and equal." 1354 An expanded parallel of 5:24. 1355 Cetasd samphuttapubbd te ca samudacaranti. The expression is unusual. Mp offers merely a routine word gloss. 1356 The questions in Pali: kimadhippaya, kimupavicara, kimadhitthana, kimabhinivesa, kimpariyosana. j 357 I read with Ce saihadhitthana, as against Be and Ee satthaclhitthanu, "a weapon is their support." Mp does not comment, but craftiness ties up better with thickets, darkness, and remaining unseen.

 that was accepted as authentic by the commentator. I therefore treat the text as reading simply sabrahmacarisu. 1367 This is Sona Kolivisa, declared by the Buddha foremost among those who arouse energy (see 1:205). His verses are at Th 632-44. Th 638-39 refer to the simile of the lute; Th 640—44 are identical with the verses at the end of this sutta. The story of Sona appears in an expanded version at Vin I 179—85, where it leads to the Buddha's granting permission to the monks to wear sandals. 1368 Reading with Ce and Ee: Viriyasamatam adhitthaha, indriyanam ca samatam pativijjha, tattha ca nimittam ganhdhi. Where Ce aad Eehave viriyasamatam, Be has viriyasamatham (but just below, indriyananca samatam). Mp (Ce) also reads viriyasamatham in the lemma. The explanation in Mp seems to support viriyasamatham. Mp: "Resolve on evenness of energy: Resolve on serenity com­ bined with energy (viriyasampayuttam samatham adhitthaha). The meaning is, 'Link energy with serenity.' Achieve evenness of the spiritual faculties: Keep to evenness, a balance of the spiritual faculties of faith, etc. When faith is linked with wisdom and wis­ dom with faith; when energy is linked with concentration and concentration with energy, then the balance of the faculties is maintained. But mindfulness is useful everywhere, so it should always be strong.., Seize the object there: When such balance exists, the object can arise clearly, like the reflection of one's face in a mirror; and you should take up (ganhdhi) this object—bring forth (nibbattehi) the object of serenity, of insight, of the path, and of the fruit. Thus the Buddha explained the meditation subject to him, leading up to arahantship." ' Chinese parallels to this passage offer quite different readings of the Buddha's injunction, as follows: T I 612a28-29: "Therefore you should distinguish this time (could samatam have mutated into samayam?)j examine this mark, and do not be heedless" (®

Mp: "He sees the arising and vanishing of that mind" (tassa c'esa cittassa uppadampi vayampi passati). 1374 The similes that follow are found among other places also at MN 97.29, II 193,1-19, and SN 35:87, IV 56,17-57,5. 1375. This means that he passed away as a non-returner. 1376 I follow.Be and Ee, in which the first, second, fourth, and fifth benefits come from listening to the Dhamma at the proper time (kalena dhammassavane), the third and sixth from examining, the . meaning at the proper time (kalena atth'upaparikkhaya). Ce com­ bines the. two for the third and sixth items, which seems less satisfactory, because in these two situations the monk doesn't get to hear the Dhamma. . 1377 Anuttare upadhisankhaye. Mp identifies this as nibbana. On the acquisitions'(upadhi), see p. 1621, note 219. 1378 Chalabhijatiyo. Purana Kassapa is one of the six teachers contem ­ porary with the Buddha. This is the only place w here he is associ­ ated with the doctrine of the six classes, which are not mentioned elsewhere in the Nikayas. In DN 2 .1 7 ,1 52,22-53,4, he is depicted as a proponent of the doctrine of non-doing (akhiyavada), but at SN 46:56, V 126,26-30, the doctrine of non-causality (ahetukavada) is ascribed to him. 1379 Bhikkhu kantakavuttika. The exact intent is not clear, but the tone is pejorative. Mp says only that these are samanas. 1380 Nibbanam abhijayati. Mp: "Produces nibbana: that is, he attains nibbana, or he is born into the class of nibbana consisting in the plane of the noble ones" (nibbanam abhijayatlti nibbanam papunati, ariyabhumisafikhataya va nibbanajatiya jayati). This explanation is given because in strict doctrinal terms nibbana, being ajata and akata, "unborn" and "unmade" is without birth or production. 1381 As at 3:13, 4:85, but here all three editions put nesadakule before venakule. 1382 In Pali: asava samvara pahalabba,' asava patisevana pahatabba, asava adhivasana pahatabba, asava parivajjana pahatabba, asava vinodana pahatabba, asava. bhavana pahatabba. These six, preceded by "taints to be abandoned by seeing" (asava dassana pahatabba), are treated in detail in the Sabbasava Sutta (MN 2), where the explanations are the same as those given here. 1383 This sentence is missing in Be, but it occurs in Ce and Ee and has parallels in the sections on the other methods of abandoning

 1384 His name means "dealer in firewood/' Mp says that he was so named because he earned his living by selling firewood. 1385 The three qualities he mentions are ascetic practices (dhutanga). These are contrasted below with non-ascetic monastic practices: living near a village, accepting invitations from laypeople to meals at their homes, and wearing robes prepared by householders. 1386 Mp says that some time later, five hundred bhikkhus who visited families returned to lay life. When he heard this he said, "What does that have to do with me?" and his faith did not vacillate. It was in anticipation of this that the Buddha said to him: "When you give gifts to the Sahgha, your mind will be confident." On the special merits of gifts to the Sangha, see MN 142.7—8, III 255-56. 1387 Abhidhammakatham kathenti. Mp explains this as "a talk involved with the Abhidhamma" (abhidhammamissakam katham), but I take abhidhammakatham here as a mere referential term. On this use of the expression, see p. 1733, note 1086. 1388 Katham opateti (as in Ce and Be; Ee has the aorist opatesi). Mp: "He interrupted their discussion and gave his own explanation" (tesarn katham vicchinditva attano katham katheti). 1389 Gopasu. I translate following Mp: gavo ca ajika ca. 1390 Sippisambuka. PED suggests "oyster" for sippi, but oysters are marine animals. My rendering is intended to escape the difficulty. 1391 Animittam cetosamadhim.

Mp: "He will remember the virtues of going forth." 1393 Mp explains that Citta returned to lay Life seven times and went forth seven times. The reason for his instability was that during the time of the Buddha Kassapa he had persuaded a bhikkhu to return to lay life. Therefore, even though he had the supporting conditions for arahantship, because of that kamma he had to move back and forth seven times between lay life and monastic life before attaining arahantship. 1394 Sn 1042. The brahmin student's name is Tissa Metteyya. On the Parayana, see p. 1639, note 367. 1395 Majjhc manta na lippati. Mp glosses manta with pahfid, taking it to be a feminine noun.

I think it more likely, however, that manta is the nominative of the agent noun mantar, "a thinker, a

 1396 Mp explains: "The contact (phassa) at the first end is one individual existence (attabhava), which is produced by way of contact. The origin of contact (phassasamudaya), the second end, is the future existence, produced with the contact of the kamma done in this existence as its condition. The cessation of contact (phassanirodha) is nibbana. Nibbana is said to be in the middle because it cuts in half craving, the seamstress." In my opinion, it would make better sense to see phassanirodha here; not as nibbana, but as the ceasing of contact at the end of the first existence. Craving is then the seamstress because it ties the contact of the previ ous existence to the initial arising of contact at the start of the new existence. 1397 Mp: "What should be directly known (abhihneyyam) is the four noble truths; what should be fully understood (parihheyyam) is the pair of mundane truths (suffering arid its origin). In this very life, he makes an end of the suffering of the round; he terminates jit and'eradicates it." 1398 Mp: "Consciousness—both rebirth-consciousness and the other kinds—is said to be in the middle because it occurs as the condi­ tion for name and form," 1399 Mp: "Kammic consciousness is in the middle; or here, because kamma is included by the mind-base among the internal bases, any kind of consciousness is in the middle; or else the javana consciousness is dependent on an internal base— for [it depends on] adverting in the mind-door—and so it is said to be in the middle." 1400 Mp: "Personal existence (sakkaya) is the round of existence with its three planes. The origin of personal existence is the truth of the origin; the cessation of personal existence is the truth of ces­ sation." Again, I would interpret this as I did the first presenta­ tion: personal existence is the present existence; the origin of personal existence is the arising of the next existence; the cessa­ tion of personal existence is the ceasing of the present existence. And craving, by generating rebirth, sews the future existence to this present One. 1401 In a Chinese parallel to this sutta, SA 1164 (T II 310b20-311a2), the bhikkhus propose only five interpretations of the verse; (1 ) six internal bases, six external bases, and feeling; (2 ) the past, the future, and the present; (3) pleasure, pain, and neither pain nor pleasure; (4) existence, its origin, and feeling; (5) identity and its origin (the middle term is missing). When they inquire from the Buddha, he explains the verse in terms of contact, its origin, and feeling. The verse in the Chinese does not have a word cor­

 1402 Here I follow the uddana verse of Be. The Ce version is not clear to me. 1403 As at 6:44, III 348,9 10. It seems that this is Ananda's way of simply confirming that the Buddha had said something without com­ mitting himself to an interpretation of the statement. 1404 Kathanhi nama yam maya ekamsena byakatam tattha dvejjha apajjissati. The Buddha's statement here belongs to his first way of answer­ ing a question, namely, by making a categorical assertion. On the four ways of answering a question, see 3:67, 4:42. - 1405 Valaggakotinittudanamattampi sukkadhammam. Mp: "An amount that could be seen on the tip of a hair; or an amount that could be poked with the tip of a hair." 1406 Ce and Ee have vibhajantassa, as against Be vibhajissami, which Ee notes as a variant from a Burmese manuscript. The Be read­ ing seems a normalization, but since the Ce/Ee reading leaves the sentence grammatically incomplete, I follow Be. The plural —nanani is in the text, and thus I use the plural "knowledges" even though it sounds odd in English. 1407 I read with Ce kusalamula, as against Be and Ee kusala. 1408 Abhidose addharattam bhattakalasamaye.. DOP sv addha defines addharattani as "midnight." On bhattakalasamaye, Mp says "the time for a meal in the king's court" (rajakuldnarn bhattakalasankhate samaye). Perhaps in the Buddha's time the royal court ended the day with a midnight meal. 1409 Nibbedhikapariyayam vo. bhikkhave dhammapariyayam dcsessami. Mp: "A penetrative exposition is one that penetrates and splits the mass of greed, [hatred, and delusion] that had not been pene­ trated and split before." 1410 The. text alternates between singular and plural forms of kamma. I have used the singular, which sounds more natural in English. 1411 Contrary to all three editions, I regard the first occurrence of sankapparago purisassa karno as either prose or a line of a familiar verse being quoted in the prose. The following verse will then be a normal verse of four lines rather than one of five lines. See SN 1:34,122, where the verse occurs with only four lines. Mp explains scinlcapparago as "lust arisen by way of intention" (sankappavasena uppannarago). Kamasahkappa is one of the three types of unwhole­ some thought, and it is clear from the context that this is what is meant. For further discussion, see CDB 366, note 72. The verse is not included in the Chinese parallel, MA 111. 1412 Mp explains this as the coexistent contact (sahajataphassa). 1413 Mp: "One desiring celestial sensual pleasures, by fulfilling good conduct, is reborn in the deva world [and acquires] an indi­

 misconduct, one is reborn in the plane of misery [and acquires] an individual existence that is a consequence of demerit." 1414 Regarding this last phrase, Mp says that it is just the spiritual life of the path (brahmacariycisahkhato maggo va) that is called the ces­ sation of sensual pleasures. It will be observed that each section follows the pattern of the four noble truths, with two additions: diversity (vemattata) and result (vipaka). 1415 Sdmisa. Mp: "Associated with the bait of the defilements" (kilesamisasampayutta). 1416 Voharavepakkam . .. sannam vadami. Mp: "Expression, consisting in talk, is the result of perception." 1417 Cetana 'ham bhikkhave kamirmm vadami. This should probably be understood to mean that volition is a necessary factor in creat­ ing kamma, not that volition on its own invariably and in all instances creates kamma. It can thus be seen as a counterfoil to the Jain position that any action, even an unintentional one, creates kamma. The Chinese parallel, MA 111, at T I 600a23-24, says: "How does one understand kamma? There are two kinds of kamma: intention and thfe kamma [created] .when one has ' intended" (Sfsj&ilg - B S i ■ ). L418. This statement should be understood in the sense that the results of kamma are to be experienced in their respective realms. 1419 See p. 1639, note 372, and p. 1666, note 547. The Chinese parallel, MA 1 1 1 , has here the fourfold distinction of kamma found in 4:232—33. But MA 15 (at T I 437b26) speaks of only two kinds of results, in this life or in a later life, without a third alternative. 1420 This should probably be understood in the sense that, because contact is the condition for intention and kamma can be explained as intention, contact is therefore the condition for kamma. 1421 Ko ekapadam dvipadam janati imassa dukkhassa nirodhaya. Mp: "The meaning is: 'Who knows a mantra, a one-word or two-word mantra?'" The Chinese parallel at T1600bi7-i8 uses the character ^ (= ?£), meaning "mantra." 1422 It is strange that only six Tathagata's powers are mentioned here. Usually, ten Tathagata's powers are cited (identified as nanabalani, powers of knowledge). In AN the ten are in 1 0 :2 1 . They are also at MN 12.9—2 0 ,1 69—71, and analyzed at Vibh 335— 44 (Be §§809-31). 142.3 Some examples of the possible (thana) and the impossible (atthana) are at 1:268-95; MN 115.12-19, III 64-67; and Vibh 335-38 (Be §809). 1424 Thanaso hetuso.

 with four factors that can either reinforce or impede its matu­ ration: realm (gati, one's place of rebirth), acquisitions (upadhi, one's body and mind), time (Mia), and effort (payoga). The cause (hetu) is the kamma itself. 1425 The four jhanas are found throughout the Nikayas. The eight emancipations (vimokkha) are at 8 :6 6 . The three kinds of concen­ tration (samadhi) are at 8:63: concentration with thought and examination, without thought but with examination only, and without thought and examination. The nine meditative attain- ments (samapatti) are the same as the nine progressive dwellings (anupubbavihara) at 9:32. The defilement (samkilesa) is a quality that leads to deterioration; the cleansing (vodana) is a quality that makes for distinction; and the emergence (vutthana), according to Vibh 342-43 (Be §828), is the cleansing and emergence itself; "Cleansing" here means that proficiency in the lower jhana is the foundation for the next higher jhana; "emergence itself" means coming out from the jhana. 1426 Ce and Be indicate, by the use of .ellipsis points, that the last three sections should be expanded in full, as in 6:2 . To facilitate readability, I present these sections without showing the elision of stock phrases. V 1427 The Abhidhamma commentary, As 239,25-240,2 (Be §362), explains ruparaga as "desire and lust for form-[sphere] existence" (rupabhave chandarago) and arupardga as "desire and lust for formless-Jsphere] existence" (arupablmve chandarago). While the word "lust" may seem strong in relation to these refined realms of existence, I feel it is useful to render ruga consistently. 1428 Cittassa nimittam. Mp: "The object of the mind of concentra­ tion and insight, the aspect of concentration and insight" (samadhivipassanacittassa nimittam samadhivipassanakaram). Mp is apparently interpreting this via the two meanings of the word nimitta, as object and as "mark" or aspect. 1429 Tatra tatra. Lit., "there [and] there." Mp: "This or that state of distinction" (tasmim tasmim visese). Mp simply glosses ayata?ie with karane ("cause"), but see p. 1669, note 562. Gn the first four of the six factors, see 4:179. 1430 Mp: "Conceit (mana) is conceiving oneself [to be better] based on birth, etc. The inferiority complex (omana) is the conceit, 'I am inferior' (hino'ham asml ti mana). Arrogance (atimana) is the conceit of self-elevation. Self-overestimation (adhimana) is imagining one­ self to have attained [what one has not really attained]. Obstinacy (thambha) is due to anger and conceit. Self-abasement (atinipata) is the conceit T am inferior' occurring in one who is actually

 1431 Alokabahulo. Mp: ''He abounds in the light of knowledge" (fidndloknbah ulo). 1432 Mp: "The mind is to be suppressed (niggahetabbam) by concentra­ tion on an occasion of restlessness; it is to be exerted by energy at a time when it has fallen into sluggishness; it is to be encouraged (paggahetabbam) with concentration at a time when it is listless; and it is to be looked at (ajjhupekkhitabbam) with the equanimity enlightenment factor when it is proceding evenly." These aspects of mental development are discussed in detail at Vism 130-35, Ppn 4.51-64. 1433 See 3:22, 5:151—53, p. 1638, note 358; and p. 1739, note 1150. 1434 Mp: "Obstruction by kamma (kammavaranata) occurs through the five grave deeds with immediate result (see 6:87). Obstruction by defilement ( kilesavajranata) occurs through wrong view with fixed result (that is, a grave wrong view that denies the working . of kamma). Obstruction by result (vipakavaranata) is an unwhole­ some resultant rebirth or a rootless wholesome resultant rebirth." These two types of rebirth consciousness lack the root of wisdom and thus one reborn through them is incapable of attaining the path. One reborn with a two-rooted rebirth consciousness, lack­ ing the root of wisdom, is also incapable of attaining the path. On the role of rebirth consciousness, see CMA 179,194—95. The kind of desire (chanda) that is needed is wholesome desire, desire to do the good (kattukamyatachandam). 1435 I follow Be, which does not have pi here, as against Ce and Ee, which have pi. In the partly parallel 5:151-53, Ce and Ee do not have pi. It seems the sense requires that pi should be excluded; for it is when listening to the good Dhamma that one would expect a person to enter the path. The same applies to 6:87 and 6 :8 8 just below. 1436 Attham. rincati. Mp: "One discards the benefit of growth" (vaddhi- attham chaddeti). Mp explains attha here in an ethical sense, as good or benefit. However, since the word is used in connection with someone listening to the teaching, it seems more likely that its semantic sense— namely, "meaning"—is intended. Thus attha is the correct meaning of the exposition, while anattha is a false meaning resulting from misinterpretation. 1437 The word khanti, normally meaning "patience," is used in relation to contemplative practice to mean one's beliefs or convictions. I base the parenthetical addition here on Mp's gloss, sasanassa ananulomikaya, "not in conformity with the teaching." 1438 Ditthisampadam. Mp: "The path of stream-entry" (sotapatti- maggam). ,

 incapable of the five enmities (that is, breach of the five precepts) and of adopting any of the sixty-two speculative views. 1440 Mp: "'A n eighth existence' means that he cannot take an eighth rebirth in the sense sphere." 1441 CeandBeanantariyamkammain;'Eeanantariya7nkainiiuim.Strangely, though this term commonly occurs in doctrinal expositions of Buddhism, a search for it in CST 4.0 turns up only one occurrence in the entire Sutta Pi taka, namely, this one. The expression also occurs in the Vinaya Pitaka, but only once, in the Devadatta story . at Vin.II193 ,37. An anantariya kamma is understood to be a grave misdeed that in the. immediately following existence necessarily produces a rebirth in hell. The five acts that constitute this type of kamma are mentioned at 5:129, 6:87, and just below at 6:94. 1442 ito bahiddha dakkhineyyam gavesitiim. That is, incapable of seeking a person of noble attainment outside the Buddha's teaching. 1443 Annam sattharam uddisitum. That is, of looking to someone else apart from the Buddha as One's ultimate spiritual teacher. 1444. Sammatianiyamam okkamissati. Sammattaniyamam is obviously an abridgment of niyamam kusalesu dhammesu sammattam, on which see p. 1638/ note 358, and p. 1739, note 1150. 1445 Sabbasankharesu anodhim karitva aniccasannam upatthdpetum. Mp: " Unlimited: without setting a boundary thus: 'Only these condi­ tioned phenomena, but no others, are impermanent.'" 1446 Ce and Ee have gacchanti, but the future meaning (originally conveyed by this form) seems intended here. Be has gacchissan tir perhaps a novel future form. 1447 I read with Be and Ee bhavissami, as against Ce bhavissati. 1448 Sabbaloke atarnmayo bhavissami. Mp: "Identification (tammayo') is craving and views; non-identification (atammayo) is their absence." . 1449 A composite six/made up of two triads. 1450 Another composite six. 1451 Pannasakatireka vagga. This is the general title Ce assigns to these three additional chapters, which it then numbers 1, 2, and 3. Ee gives this the title Pannasasahgahito vaggo, "Chapter included with the Fifty" (?). Be does not assign a general title to the addi­ tional chapters, but numbers them 11 , 12, and 13 in succession to the earlier vaggas of this nipata. 1452 From this point on there are no uddana verses to rely on for sutta titles. I thus adopt the titles in Ce. 1453 It is often claimed that this series of suttas testifies to a large num­ ber of lay arahants during the Buddha's time. This, however, is a misunderstanding. For we find on this list Anathapindika,

 Tusita heaven (see 6:44 and MN 143.16, III 262,i). We also find Ugga of Vesali, who is said (at 5:44) to have been reborn among the mind-made deities, and Hatthaka, who is said (at 3:127) to have been reborn in the Aviha heaven of the pure abodes. The terms used to describe these lay followers are descriptive of all noble ones from stream-enterers on up. They all have unwav­ ering confidence (aveccappasada) in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha, have "reached certainty about the Tathagata" (tathagate nitthangata), and are seers of nibbana, the deathless (amataddasa). See 10:63, where certainty about the Buddha is ascribed to dis­ ciples at levels lower than arahantship. The statement that these people have noble liberation (ariyena vimuttiya) is unusual, but Mp glosses it "by the liberation of the fruit of trainees" (sekha- phalavimuttiya). Quite a different formula is used to describe an arahant. In the Nikayas there are no recorded cases of laypeople who attained arahantship and then continued to lead the lay life. Those who do attain it entered upon, the homeless life soon after their attainment, like Yasa at Vin I 17,1-3. 1454 The total number of suttas in this repetition series is calculated by taking the ten modes of treatment (from "direct knowledge" to "relinquishment'"') in regard to the seventeen defilements (from lust to heedlessness); this gives 170. Since each mode of treat­ ment is to be accomplished by developing one or another of the three sets of six, this gives a total of 510 suttas.

 1461 This is stated from the perspective of monastics thinking to approach families for alms. 1462 Mp: "They do not rise up from their seats in a humble manner but show disrespect/' 1463 The seven are explained in detail, at MN 70.14—21, I 477—79. In brief, the one liberated in both respects and the one liberated by wisdom are two kinds of arahants, distinguished by whether or not they possess the "peaceful formless emancipations tran­ scending form." The body witness, the one attained to view, and the one liberated by faith are three kinds of trainees, who can range anywhere from stream-enterer to one on the path to arahantship; they have already been discussed at 3:21. The Dhamma follower and the faith follower are two types who have entered the path to stream-entry but have not yet realized the fruit; they are distinguished according to whether wisdom or faith is their dominant faculty. The process by which they enter the path is described at SN 25:1, III 225. 1464 Parangata thale titthati brahmano. Here, "brahmin" Is used as .a synonym for the arahant. See in this connection 4:5 §4 and SN 35:228,- IV 157,1?-20’ 1465 At Pp 13 (Be §16) this person is called a samaslsi, lit., "a same- header." Mp explains that there are four kinds of samaslsi. (1 ) One who has been ill and attains the destruction of the taints at the same time that he recovers from the illness is called an "illness same-header" (rogasamaslsi). (2) One who has been afflicted with a severe painful feeling and attains the destruction of the taints at the same time that he overcomes'the pain is called a "feeling same-header" (vedanasamasist). (3) One who has been practic­ ing insight in a particular posture and attains the destruction of ' the taints at the same time that he breaks the posture is called a "posture same-header" (iriyapathasamaslsl). (4) And one who attains the destruction of the taints at the same time that his life ends is called a "life same-header" (jivitasamasTsl). In this sutta, the "life same-header" is intended. 1466 Antaraparinibbayi. Lit., "one who attains nibbana in between (or along the way)/' Pp 16 (Be §36) defines this person as one who eliminates the five lower fetters, takes spontaneous birth, and then, either immediately after being reborn or (at the latest) before reaching the middle of the life span, generates the path for abandoning the five higher fetters. Similarly, Mp defines this type as a person who is reborn somewhere among the pure abodes (suddhavasesu) and then attains arahantship either at the time of rebirth, slightly afterward, or before reaching the middle

###### 1774 The Anguttara Nikaya

 understood to mean literally that he attains the destruction of the taints in betzoeen or along the way (an tar a), that is, between two lives, and then attains final nibbana without taking rebirth at all. See 4:131 and p. 1701, note 829.1 give further arguments for this interpretation below in note 1536 on p. 1782. 1467 Upahaccaparinibbayi. Both Pp 17 (Be §37) and Mp define this type as one who eliminates the five lower fetters, takes spontaneous rebirth (in the pure abodes), and then reaches arahantship after passing the middle of the life span or, at the latest, at the time of death. Again, as I will maintain in relation to 7:55, there are suggestions in the Nikayas that this type is one who attains the destruction of the taints almost immediately after taking rebirth in the pure abodes. See p. 1782, note 1537. 1468 The difference between (5) and (6 ) is probably determined pri- marity on the basis of the amount of effort they must put forth to win the goal. Pp 17 (Be §§38-39) says merely that one generates the path without effort and the other as the result of. effort. In any case, on the commentarial interpretation these two become, not separate types of non-returners, but two modes in which the first two types (the antaraparinibbayi and the upahaccaparinibbayi) attain nibbana. Such an explanation would reduce the distinct types of non-returners to three. This would override the sequen­ tial and mutually exclusive nature of the five types, which is implied by the fivefold classification and strongly suggested by .the similes of 7:55.' 1469 See p. 1701, note 828. 1470 By using ellipsis points, Ee incorporates 7:18 and 7:19 into 7:17, and thus at this point its numbering falls two short of my own. My numbering fpllows Ce and Be in counting the expositions based on non-self and nibbana as distinct suttas. 1471 Whereas the contemplations of impermanence and suffering are directed toward all conditioned phenomena (sabbasankharesu), the contemplation of non-self is directed toward all phenomena without qualification (sabbadhammesu). 1472 Niddasavatthuni. PED takes niddasa^ to be a wrong reading for nid- desa and explains the compound to mean "object of distinction, or praise." SED sv nirdasa gives "more than ten days old, happened more than ten days ago." The expression itself, however, has no necessary connection with days and could also be explained by taking ni to be a privative prefix and thus meaning "without ten." Thus as used here it might just as well mean "without ten years." Mp accepts the reading as given and offers an explanation, which I translate just below. It could be that the original meaning of

 nothing to rely on but conjecture. There are no identified Chinese parallels to this sutta or to 7:42—43 below to serve as a check. Here is Mp: "The question ['How is one tenless?'] is said to have arisen among the outside sectarians. For they call a Nigantha [a Jain ascetic] niddaso ("ten-less") who has died at the time he is ten years of age [dasavassakale; or: "at the time he has ten years' seniority" (as an ascetic)?]. For, it is said, he does not become ten years of age again. And not only doesn't he become ten years of age again, [he doesn't become] nine years of age or even one year of age. In this way, they call a Nigantha who is dead at the.age of twenty years, and so on, nibblso ('twenty-less'), nittimso ('thirty-less'), niccattaliso ('forty-less'), nippannaso ('fifty- less'). When Ananda was wandering in the .village, he heard this discussion and reported it to the Blessed One. The Blessed Orie said: 'This is not a designation for the sectarians, Ananda, but for the taint-destroyer [arahant] in my teaching.' For if the tain t-destr oyer attains final nibbana when, he is ten years of age
 [or: has ten years' seniority?], he does not become one. of ten
**3^ears again. Not only one of ten j^ears, he doesn't become one**
###### of nine years... of a single year. Not only one of a single year, he doesn't become one of eleven months ... nor even one of a single moment. Why? Because he never again takes rebirth. The same method for one who is 'twenty-less' and so on. Thus the Blessed One begins this teaching to show the causes for becoming one who is 'ten-less.'" 1473 Icchavinaye tibbacchando hoti ayatinca icchavinaye avigatapemo. I here render iccha as "vain wishes" and chanda as "desire. " Mp glosses iccha with tanha, craving. 1474 This teaching is referred to at DN 16.1.5, II 75,23-31. 1475 I add "the city" on the basis of Mp's gloss: "situated inside the city" (antonagare thitani). 1476 Mp: "When people neglect the righteous oblations, the deities do not protect them, and even if they cannot create new suffering, they intensify arisen suffering, such as coughs and headaches, etc.; and in time of war, the people have no allies. But when people don't neglect the oblations, the deities protect them well, and even if they cannot create new happiness, they remove old illnesses; and when war breaks out, the people have allies." 1477 What follows is also in DN 16.1.1-5, II 72-76. 1478 The text of 7:23-27 is at DN 16.1.6-10, II 76-80. 1479 Mp: "As long as they do not come to a stop at some attainment, such as purification of virtuous behavior, jhana, insight, stream- entry, and so forth, without having attained arahantship, only

 1480 All these perceptions are explained at 10:60, with three additions. 1481 Reading with Ee na iti patisaficikkhati. Ce and Be omit na. Brahmali suggests "he is supposed to leave this work for the the ms [elders], who are expected to look after it." 1482 Ce attana voyogam apajjati; Ee attana vo yogam apajjati; Be attana tesu yogam apajjati. Again, I follow Brahmali's interpretation: "Since it is the task of these elders, they will have to take ultimate responsibility (and the blame or praise) no matter who carries it out. Thus he should leave it to them." 1483 Tattha ca pubbakaram karoti. See 5:175, 6:93. Mp: "He first gives to those following other creeds and only afterwards to bhikkhus." 1484 Be, but not Ce or Ee, has the following before the verses: "This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this." 1485 Ee joins this sutta and the next and mistakenly counts them as three, 28-30. Thus Ee's numbering, which had been two behind my own, now lags behind by one. 1486 An expanded parallel of 6:32. 1487 An expanded parallel of 6:33. 1488 An expanded parallel of 6:69, without the preliminary portion of the latter. 1489 An expanded parallel of 3:135. 1490 Khinena natimannati. I translate on the supposition that khinena is an adverb meaning "hurtfully, roughly" (see DOP sv khlna2). Mp, however, explains the line on the assumption that khinena means "in [time of] loss, when wealth has been exhausted": "When one's wealth is exhausted, he does not despise one because of one's loss. He does not think too highly of himself and look down on the other" (tassa bhoge khlne tena khayena tarn natimannati, tasmim omanam attani ca atimanam na karoti). On Mp's interpretation, though, I do not see how this factor would differ from the preceding one. 1491 Vatta. Mp says only "he is skilled in speech" (vacanakusalo). Since giving deep talks is listed as a separate item, here presumably the meaning is that he gives gooid advice. 1492 On the four analytical knowledges (patisambhida), see 4:172. 1493 I translate the text exactly as it has come down, but it seems that in the course of transmission a phrase dropped out suggesting that mental.sluggishness has arisen on a particular occasion. Mp thus provides the missing phrase, uppanne cetaso llnatte, "when mental sluggishness has arisen." 1494 Mp connects internal constriction with dullness and drowsiness,


-----

###### Notes to the Sevens 1777

 1495 At 4:41 §3, this is called "the development of concentration that leads to mindfulness and clear comprehension." Mp: "Feeling, etc., are the roots of mental proliferation (papanca). For feeling is the root of craving, which arises in relation to pleasure. Percep­ tion is the root of views, which arise toward an unclear object. And thought is the root of conceit, which arises through the thought, T am.'" 1496 Mp explains "mark" (nimitta) here as cause (Icarana). 1497 Ee prints this as a continuation of the preceding sutta, but Ce and Be, which.I follow, treat it as distinct. My numbering again exceeds that of Ee by two. 1498 Though the text-here uses the present tense pajanati, I construe . this as the historical present, referring to the time before Sariputta attained arahantship. As an arahant he would no longer have been prone to mental sluggishness, internal constriction, or external distraction. 1499 Six of these skills, excluding the first, are mentioned at 6:24. 1500 Again, Ee prints this as a continuation of the preceding Sutta, but Ce and Be consider it distinct. Since I follow Ce and Be/my numbering now exceeds Ee by three. 1501 See 7:20. 1502 Vinnanatthitiyo. The word is used here in a different sense than at SN 22:54, III 54,26, where the four vinnanatthitiyo are the four aggregates functioning as the supports for vinnana. In the pres­ ent sutta they are planes of rebirth. Mp calls them "grounds for the rebirth consciousness" (patisandhivinnanassa thanani). The original meaning of the seven, as described here, is probably lost. Mp explains them against the background of the Abhidhamma distinction among types of rebirth consciousness, for which see CMA 179-30, 210-19. 1503 Mp: "Human, beings are different in body (nanattakaya) because there are no two people whose bodies are exactly alike. They are different in perception (nanattasannino) because in some cases their rebirth perception (patisandhisafina) has three roots, in others two roots, and in still others it is rootless. The devas mentioned are the six sense-sphere devas. The beings in the lower world are certain yakkhas and spirits outside the plane of misery." 1504 Mp: "These are the devas of Brahma's assembly, Brahma's min­ isters, and the great brahmas. Their bodies are different in perva­ sion according to their respective level, but their perception is the same because they all have the perception pertaining to the first jhana. The beings in the four planes of misery also belong to

###### 1778 The Anguttara Nikaya

 1505 Mp takes "the devas of streaming radiance" (deva abhassara) to represent all three classes of devas pertaining to the second jhana: those of limited radiance, measureless radiance, and streaming radiance. In each plane, their bodies are identical in that they all have the same pervasion (ekavippharo va), but their perception is different in that some are without thought but retain examina­ tion (avitakka-vicaramatta), while others are without thought and examination (avitakka-avicara).. 1506 Mp; "The devas of refulgent glory (subhakinha) are identical in body, and also identical in perception because they all have the perception pertaining to the fourth jhana (in the Abhidhamma. scheme of five jhanas). The devas of great fruit (who are reborn through the fifth jhana of the fivefold scheme) fall under the . fourth station of consciousness. The non-percipient beings do not have consciousness and thus are not included." 1507 The non-percipient devas and the devas of the base of neither- perception-nor-non-perception are included among the nine abodes of beings (see 9:24) but not among the stations of consciousness. . . 1508 Ariyo sammasamadhi sa-upaniso itipi saparikkharo itipi. The "sup­ ports" (upanisa) and "accessories" (parikkhara) are the other seven path factors. See too MN 117, III 7 1 ,22. 1509 The meanings of these seven fires will be explained in the fol­ lowing sutta. 1510 Mp says that thuna is the sacrificial post itself: yupasankhatam thunam. 1511 Ge and Be atohayam (Ee ato 'yam), brahmana, ahuto sambhuto. Mp glosses: atohayan ti ato hi matapitito ayatn ahuto ii agato. There seems to be a word play here between ahuta as representing abhuta, "originated," and as past participle of ajuhati, "offered, sacrificed." See DOP sv ahuta! and ahuta2. 1512 Appatikulyata santhati. Lit., "[if] non-revulsion becomes settled." 1513 Natthimepubbenaparamviseso.Ibasettdsrenderingofpubbenaparam vist'sa on Mp: "There is no distinction between the earlier time when I had not developed it and the later time when I devel­ oped it" (natthi mayham pubbena abhavitakalena saddhim aparam bhavitakale viseso). In other contexts; pubbenaparam visesa means the successive stages of excellence reached by mental develop­ ment, but that explanation does not work here. 1514 Mp connects "I-making" (ahankara) with views, "mine-making" (mamankara) with craving, and conceit with the ninefold conceit (navavidhamana): that is, considering oneself superior, equal, or

 or inferior. "Transcended discrimination" (vidhasamatikkanta) means having overcome the threefold conceit of being superior, equal, or inferior. 1515 Mp: "It is said that he thought: 'In the sj'stem of the brahmins, one lives the celibate life for forty-eight years studying the Vedas. But the ascetic Gotama, living at home, enjoys himself with the three kinds of dancing girls in three mansions. So what now will he say?' Thus he asks with reference to this. Then the Blessed One, as if gaining control of a black snake with a mantra or as if stepping on an enemy's neck with his foot, roars his lion's roar. He shows that even during his six years of striving, a time when he still had defilements, not even a thought arose in him with regard to the pleasure of rulership or the dancing girls in his mansions." 1516 Sam.yogavisamyogam dhammapariyayam. The title might also have been rendered "connection and disconnection." 1517 In Pali: itthikuitam, itthalcappam, itthiyidham, itthicchandam, itthissaram, itthalankaram. Apparently it is these seven terms, and their masculine, counterparts (with purisa in place of itthi), that explain the inclusion of this sutta in the Sevens. I translate on the basis of the glosses offered by Mp. 1518 These are the ancient brahmin rishis who were supposedly the composers of the Vedic hymns. They are mentioned in this capacity at 5:192, III 224,5-6, and 229,28-230,1, and at DN1238,21-23, and MN II 169,29 3i. 1519 The three editions have slightly different readings. I follow Ce cittalankaram cittaparikkharanti. Neither Be nor Ee have the quota­ tion marker ti. Mp: "It is an ornament, an accessory, of the mind pertaining to serenity and insight" (samathaznpassanacit tassa). 1520 At 2:133 and 4:177 §4 she is held up as a model for the Bud­ dha's female lay followers. She is probably identical with Uttara Nandamata, declared at 1:262 to be the foremost of meditators among female lay followers. 1521 Atitheyya: the traditional gift given to a guest as a token of hospitality. 1522 A comment is called for about the expression acchariyam cibbhutam. Though often rendered "wonderful and marvelous," the phrase is not always intended to express appreciation but to suggest, rather, astonishment and amazement. Of course, the boundarj' line between the two senses is porous, as can be seen from the way the English words "wonderful" and "marvelous," which now have an appreciative sense, evolved from words connected with astonishment. 1523 Be and Ee read sallapissasi ti. Ce sallapissati ti, in the third person,

In this way the three pairs of phrases represent a sequence of arrest, imprisonment, and execution. 1525 Cittassa annathattam. The expression recurs just below.

Lit., "that you will purify even the arising of mind." 1527 Yakkhayonim. Mp: "The spirit realm is the state of an earth-bound deity (bhummadevatabhavam)." Yoni is here used in the sense of "realm," and thus the expression yakkhayoni does not imply that yakkhas are bom from the womb. 1528 This establishes her status as a non-returner, who has abandoned the five lower fetters but not the five higher fetters. 1529 The undeclared points (abyakatavatthuni) are ten matters that the Buddha has not addressed: whether or not the world is eternal, whether the world is finite or infinite, whether the life-principle is the same as the body or different from the body, and the four alternatives concerning the after-death status of the Tathagata. 1530 Na chambhati, na kampati, na vedhati, na santasam apajjati abyakatavatthusu. Ce also has na calati, not in Be or Ee. 1531 Mp glosses purisagatiyo with purisassa nanagatiyo, "a person's movement of knowledge." However, the sutta appears to be concerned principally with their destination (gati) after death. The Chinese parallel, MA 6 (T1427ai3-c24), renders the title of its Indian original (corresponding to satta purisagatiyo) as t # APfrtt 7£M, meaning "seven places where good persons are reborn." 1532 No c'assa no ca me siya, na bhavissati na me bhavissati. This cryptic formula occurs in the Nikayas in two versions. One is ascribed to the annihilationists; the other is the Buddha's adaptation of it. The annihilationist version reads: no c' assam no ca me siya, na bhavissami na me bhavissati, "I may not be, and it might not be mine. I will not be, and it will not be mine." Since the two differ only with respect to two verbs— no c'assam vs. no c'assa, and na bhavissami vs. na bhavissati— the various recensions sometimes confuse them. From the commentarial glosses, it appears that the confusion had already set in before the age of the commentaries. Readings also differ among different editions of the same text. Generally I prefer the readings in Ce. This formula is explicitly identified as an annihilationist view (ucchedaditthi) at SN 22:81, III 99,4-6. In AN, at 10:29 §8,


-----

###### V 63,28-64,2, it is said to be the foremost of outside speculative views (etadaggam bahirakanam ditthigatanam). The Buddha trans­ formed this formula into a theme for contemplation conformable to his own teaching by replacing the first-person verbs with their third-person counterparts. This change shifts the stress from the view of self implicit in the annihilationist version ("I will be anni­ hilated") to an impersonal perspective that harmonizes with the anatta doctrine. In some texts, for example at SN 22:55, III 55-58, practicing on the basis of the formula is said to culminate in the destruction of the five lower fetters, that is, in the stage of a non-returner. Sometimes, as in the present sutta, the formula includes a trailer (see below), contemplation of which is said to lead to equanimity. Practice guided by the full formula leads to one of the five levels of non-returner or to arahantship. In the Nikayas the precise meaning of the formula is never made explicit, which suggests that it may have served as an open guide to contemplation to be filled in by the meditator through personal intuition. The commentaries, including Mp, take the truncated particle c' to represent ce, "if," and interpret the two parts of the formula as conditionals. I translate here from Mp (in conformity with its own interpretation): “If it had not been: If, in the past, there had been no kamma producing individual existence; it would not be mine: now I would have no individual existence. There will not be: Now there will be no kamma produc­ ing a future individual existence for me; there will not be mine: in the future there will be no individual existence for me." I dissent from the commentaries on the meaning of c’, which I take to represent ca = "and." The syntax of the phrase as a whole requires this. Skt parallels actually contain ca (for instance, Udanavarga 15:4, parallel to Ud 78,1-3, has: no ca syan no ca me sya[n]; and MA 6 contains the character 'J'l- (= "and") in the appro­ priate places of the formula. As I interpret the meaning, the first "it" refers to the personal five aggregates, the second to the world apprehended through the aggregates. For the worldling this dyad is misconstrued as a duality of self and world; for the noble disciple it is simply the duality of internal and external phenomena. On this basis I would interpret the formula thus: "The five aggregates can be terminated, and the world presented by them can be terminated. I will so strive that the five aggregates will be terminated, (and thus) the world presented by them will be terminated." The trailer reads in Pali: yadatthi yam bhutam tam pajahaml ti upekkham patilabhati. Following Mp, I understand "what exists, what has come to be" {yadatthi yam bhutam) as the presently

###### existing five aggregates. These have come to be through the craving of previous lives and are being abandoned by the aban­ donment of the cause for their re-arising in a future life, namely, craving or desire-and-lust. 1533 Atth'uttarim padam santam sammappannaya passati. Mp: "H e sees with path wisdom together with insight, 'There is a higher peace­ ful state, nibbana.'" 1534 It is the continued presence of these three defilements that distin­ guishes the non-returner from the arahant, who has eliminated them. 1535 In accordance with the usual Theravada corrimentariailposition> Mp explains the antaraparinibbayi as one who attains nibbana—- the complete extinction of defilements— from the time im m e­ diately following rebirth up to the middle of the life span. This position seems contradicted by the similes to follow' 1536 The similes illustrate three types of antaraparinibbayi, "attainers of nibbana iri the interval." Although arguments based on sim ­ iles are not alw ays reliable, the three similes suggest that the "attainer of nibbana in the interval" attains nibbana before actu­ ally taking rebirth. Just as the three chips are extinguished after flying off from the red-hot bowl but before hitting the ground, so (on my interpretation) these three types attain final nibbana respectively either right after entering the intermediate state, or during this state, or shortly before rebirth would take place. In this case, they im m ediately enter the nibbana element without residue (anupadisesanibbanadhatu). 1537 Mp interprets this person as one who attains nibbana between the midpoint of the life span and its end. However, the word
**_upahacca, "having struck, having hit," and the simile of the chip_**
###### that goes out on hitting the ground, suggest that this type is one who attains nibbana almost immediately after rebirth. 1538 Whereas the standard Theravada commentarial interpretation takes the next tw o types— one who attains nibbana without exer­ tion (asankharaparinibbayi) and one who attains nibbana through exertion (sasankharaparinibbayl)— to be two alternative ways by which the antaraparinibbayi and bpahaccaparinibbfiyt attain the goal, the similes of the chip suggest, unambiguously, that the five types (or seven, counting separately the three subdivisions of the first) are distinct, forming a series from the sharper to the more sluggish. Thus if, as Mp alleges, the upahaccaparinibbayl were one who attains nibbana between the midpoint of the life span and its end, there would be no scope for the other two types, those who attain nibbana without exertion and those who attain

###### 1539 See p. 1701, note 828. 1540 Anupadisesa $uvimutta. Mp says that this refers to the five hun­ dred bhikkhunls of M ahapaiapati's retinue, who have been lib­ erated w ithout leaving any residue of clinging (upadanasesam atthapetva). The discussion to follow in the sutta makes it clear that anupadisesa here m eans that they have eliminated all defile­ ments without residue, not that they have attained the nibbana element without residue (anupadisesanibbanadhatu). 1541 Of the seven types m entioned in §§1-7, the first two, being ara­ hants, have no residue of defilements; the other five, being train­ ees, have a residue of defilements. 1542 In the normal sevenfold, classification of noble persons^ the sev­ enth person is the faith follower (sciddhanusan). Here, however, the seventh place is taken by the nnimittavihari, "one who dwells in the m arkless." M p says that the Buddha is actually describing the faith follower as one who practices strong insight (balava- vipassakavasena) . It explains that "all m arks" are all marks of per­ manence and.so forth, and the rnarkless mental concentration (animittam cetosamadhim) as the concentration of strong insight (balavavipassanasamadhim). Possibly Mp is attempting to rational­ ize a textual discrepancy, which might be indicative of a different understanding of the seventh noble person. 1543 This is an expanded parallel of 5:34, enlarged by partly incorpo­ rating the contents of 5:38. 1544 Mp: "They arouse com passion with the thought: 'Whom should we help today? W hose gift should .we receive or to whom should we teach the D ham m a?"' 1545 This is a "com posite seven," arrived at by combining a tetrad and a triad neither of w hich appears in AN as the theme of an independent sutta. The first tetrad, however, echoes 5:100. 1546 I read with Be and Ee tava savaka, as against Ce tathagatasavaka.. 1547 An expanded parallel of 5:201, 6:40. 1548 Pacalayamano nisinno hoti. Just below, Mp glosses the Buddha's question,. "Pacalayasi no?" with "Niddayasi nu" ("Are you fall­ ing asleep?"). Mp: "W hile depending on the village for alms, M oggallana had been practicing meditation in the grove. For seven days he had energetically practiced walking meditation and the effort fatigued him. Thus he was dozing off [in the seat] at the end of the w alkw ay." 1549 The follow ing exch an ge is also at M N 37.2-3, 1 2 5 1 -5 2 , but with Sakka as the inquirer. Mp explains the passage thus: " Nothing (lit., not all things) is worth holding to (sabbe dhamma nalam abhinivesaya): here, 'all things' (sabbe dhamma) are the five aggre­ gates the twelve sense bases and the eighteen elements These

 are not worth holding to by w ay of craving and views. W hy not? Because they do not exist in the w ay they are held to. They are held to be perm anent, pleasurable, and self, but they turn out to be impermanent, suffering, and non-self. Therefore they are not worth holding to. One directly knows them by the full under­ standing of the known (nataparinndya abhijdndti) as impermanent, suffering, and non-self. O n e fully understands them in the same . way by the full understanding of scrutinization (tiranaparinnaya parijanati)." The "all things" in m y translation from Mp relates to the "nothing" of the sutta, since the Pali phrase of the sutta is a negation of sabbe dhamma ("not all things"). On the three kinds of full understanding (parinna), see Vism 606,18-607,23, Ppn

Ce uses ' , m u.punna as the m nem onic; Be has mettd and titles it "M etta- sutta." 1551 On the evolution of a new world system after a period of dis­ solution, see DN 1.2.2-^£, 1 17,24—18,4. 1552 Ce has in brackets sattakkhattum, "seven times," not in Be or Ee.

On the seven gems, see M N 129.34—41, III 172—76. 1554 Ee has Jambusandassa, Ce JambudXpassa (perhaps a normalization), Be Jambumandassa. Jambusandassa is at Sn 552 = Th 8 2 2 .1, use the familiar name Jam budlpa, the "Rose-Apple Island," the greater Indian subcontinent. 1555 I read with Ce and Ee asahasena dhammena, as against Be asahasena kammena. 1556 Ce pathavyo [Ee pathabyo] yena vuccati. Be is less satisfactory: pathabyo me na vipajjati. 1557 I read with Ce and Ee homi here and in the first line of the next verse.

So all three editions, but an older Sri Lankan edition has adhigacchati and a Siamese edition pat ipajjat i. All three will work, but with different nuances.

###### prose portion. Mp says "having obtained something profitable, he thinks 'I have gotten what is harmful"' (vuddhim gahetva . . . anattho me gahito ti sallakkheti). The Chinese counterpart at 6 l 8ai2 has WMWrXffl, J, "when he should have obtained great wealth, on the contrary he gets what is harmful." 1562 All three editions have vadham katvana, "having slain," which I follow, but there is a variant, vanam katvana, "having wounded." Mp seems to supports vadham with its gloss, “he commits the act of taking life" (panatipatakammam katva). The Chinese at 618ais has only "the angry person does a bodily or verbal deed." 1563 The verse presents several difficulties. Pada a reads dummankuyam padasseti. Hardy, in his Preface to. AN Vol. V (pp. v-vi), states that " dummahku signifies one who is staggering in a disagree­ able, censurable, and scandalous manner, because he is not ashamed at his behavior, or the like." Mp glosses the word with . dubbannamukhatam, "an ugly facial expression," which the Chi- nese (at 618 a2i) approxim ates with The verb in pada c, patayati, is unclear. Mp glosses with nibbattati, "is produced," which is not sufficiently precise. PED offers "to be spread out" (perhaps from *sphatayati; see SED sv sphat), which I adopt! The Chinese "from this is produced hostile envy," m ay be based on a different w ord in its Indie original, perhaps sprhayati (see SED sv sprh), which could have arisen from a corruption of something related to *sphdtayati: 1564 Reading with Ce and Be yathatatham, as against Ee yathakatham. 1565 Mp identifies "b rah m in " here as -an arahant (khinasava- brahmanam). 1566 Honti kuddho puthuttanam. I render this following Mp's gloss of puthuttanam with puthu nanakaranehi attanam. 1567 Bhunahaccani kammani. The commentaries consistently gloss bhunahata simply as hatavuddhi, "one who destroys growth." SED, sv bhruna, lists bhrunahati as the killing of an embryo, and bhrunahatya as the killing of a learned brahmin. 1568 Reading with Ce ekam etam akusalam, as against Be yathd metam akusalam and Ee ekam. ekam akusalam. I take "this one unwhole­ some [quality]" to be anger. 1569 Reading with Ce vltamoha, as against Be and Ee vitalobha, "w ith­ out greed." 1570 Reading with Ce and Be parinibbanti, as against Ee parinibbimsu.

###### 1573 The yojana is between seven and nine miles in length. 1574 Annatra ditthapadehi. Mp: "W ho will believe this, except the noble disciples, stream-enterers who Have seen the truth?" The truth, or state (pada), seen by the stream -enterer is nibbana, the cessa­ tion of suffering. 1575 Ko manta ko saddhata. Mp (Ce) glosses: "W ho is able to discuss this for the sake of generating faith in this, or who has faith in this?" (ko tassa saddhapanatthaya mantetum samattho, ko va tassa saddhata). Saddhata is nominative singular of the agent noun saddhatar. So manta, which is parallel to it, must.be an agent noun from mantar, " a thinker/- T he Chinese parallel, M A 8, has nothing correspond­ ing, to Pali manta. I translate from T I 429b7-ii: "I now tell you, Sineru,. the king of mountains, will collapse and be destroyed. W ho can believe this, but those who have seen the truth? I now tell you, the waters of the great oceans will dry up and evaporate' W ho can believe this, but those who have seen the truth? I now tell you, the great earth will entirely burn up and be destroyed by fire. Who can believe this, but those who have seen the truth?" 1576 He is also mentioned at 6:54, in 371,16-27. 1577 With this begins the six planes of sense-sphere heavens, from the highest down to the lowest. 1578 The Buddha relates this of himself with reference to his own past lives at 7:62. 1579 As at 4:1, including the verses. 1580. Salakanceva jevanikanca. Mp: "Salaka are weapons that can be released (nissaggiya), such as arrow s and spears; jevanika are the other types of weapons, such as one-edge swords." SED sv salyaka, gives "arrow , dart, spear." PED defines jevanika as " a kind of (missile) w eapon," but missiles, according to Mp, are to be included under salaka. 1581 M y renderings of these term s, som etim es obscure in the origi­ nal, are partly based on the explanations given in Mp. Here are the explanations I follow for the term s that are not self-evident: Celaka ("standard-bearers"): those w ho, in the fighting, go in front carrying the standards of victory. Calaka ("cam p m ar­ shals"): those who organize the1 m ilitary array thus: "Let this be the king's place, this is the place for the chief minister," etc. Pindadayika ("food servers/' lit., "lum p-givers"): forceful great warriors. It is said that they enter the opponents' arm y and fly about cutting them up as if into lum ps (pindapindamiva); having risen up, they come out; or else it is those who take food and drink to the warriors in the m idst of the battle. [I have trans­ lated based on this second derivation, which seems more plau­ sible.] Pakkhandhino ("front-line com m andoes") are those who

Those who returned to lay life had been going around violating the lesser and minor training rules. And those who attained arahantship had purified their behavior. The Teacher's discourse was fruitful for all three. [Question:] Granted it was fruitful for those who attained arahantship, how was it fruitful for the others? [Reply:] Because if they had not heard this discourse, [the first kind] would have become heedless and would not have been able to abandon their condition.

Anukampa (the abstract noun of anukampt) has a slightly different nuance than karuna, the second im m easurable quality. Anukampa usually suggests com passion as a m otive for action on behalf of others, w hereas karuna gener­ ally designates a meditative state. 1617 I translate on the basis of the Be knd Ee reading assamedham, w hich accords with the name of the first of this traditional group of sacrifices mentioned elsewhere in the Nikayas. At 4:39 these sacrifices are condemned for the harm they inflict on helpless creatures. Ce here reads sassamedham, "the corn sacrifice," the gloss found in Mp (both Ce and Be). The gloss is perhaps apolo­ getic, intended to justify the ascription of this sacrifice to the royal sages.

 1630 N anda, the Buddha's half-brother, apparently had strong sen­ sual desires. After he became a monk he constantly thought of his fiancee and later hoped to be reborn among the celestial nymphs. His story is told at Ud 3:2, 21—24. 1631 At 4:41, this is called the development of concentration that leads to mindfulness and clear comprehension. 1632 Annenannam paticarati, bahiddha katham apanameti, kopanca dosanca appaccayanca patukaroti. 1633 I read w ith Ce and Be niddhamath'etam .. . niddhamath'etam, as against Ee dhamath'etam ... niddhamath'etam. 1634 All readings of this sentence seem confused. Ce has kim vo para- putto vihetluyati, where the passive verb does not seem to fit. Ee has kim vo paraputta vihetheti, which links a plural subject to an active singular verb. Be has kim vo tena paraputtena visodhitena, "W hat do you have [to do] with that son of another who has been purified?" which makes no sense in this context. Ee includes still m ore variants in its footnotes. I take the required reading to be: kim vo paraputto vihetheyya. Mp does not offer ah explanation, but the implication seems to be that the troublesome monk, by his behavior, is not a real disciple of the Buddha and thus can be considered a "son" (that is, a disciple) of another teacher. 1635 Ailnesam bhaddakanam bhikkhunam. I assume that it is the above eight m odes of behavior that account for the classification of this sutta am ong the Eights. 1636 Kutharipasena. DOP is uncertain about the m eaning but suggests it might be the ring or blade of the axe. PED has "throw of an axe." . 1637 Nalerupucimandamule. Sp I 108,29-30 says that Naleru was the name of a yakkha. 1638 A similar rebuke against the Buddha is voiced at 4:22. 1639 Arasarupo bhavam Gotamo. Mp: "The brahmin, lacking wisdom, did not recognize that the Buddha was the eldest in the world. U tterly unwilling to accept the Buddha's statem ent, he spoke thus, referring to the 'taste of concord'(samaggirasa), which in the w orld m eans paying homage, standing respectfully, reverential salutation, and polite conduct. To soften his mind, the Blessed One avoids directly contradicting him; instead he states that the term applies to him, but intending this in a different sense. [The Buddha speaks of 'taste'] as the gratification in sensual pleasure that arises in worldlings—even in those considered the best by w ay of class or rebirth— who relish, w elcom e, and lust after objects such as forms, etc." 1640 Nibbhogo bhavam Gotamo.

###### (samaggiparibhogo, conviviality), by which he again refers to such respectful gestures as paying homage to elders, etc. But the Bud­ dha speaks with reference to the lustful enjoym ent of sensual pleasures that arises in ordinary beings. 1641 Akiriyavado bhavam Gotamo. The doctrine of non-doing, as expressed by its proponents, denies the distinction between good and evil. See DN 2.17, I 52,22-53,2; M N 60.13, I 404,21-35; M N 76.10, I 516,3-17; SN 24.6, III 208,20-209,6. Mp says that the brahm in intended this in the sense that the Buddha did not act in accord with convention, as by paying hom age tO his elders, etc. But the Buddha spoke with reference to the non-doing of. bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct. 1642 Ucchedavado bhavam Gotamo. The annihilationists proclaimed "the annihilation, destruction, and exterm ination" of a truly existent person at death. See DN 1.3.9-16, 1 34,2-35,36. Mp says that the brahm in intended to accuse the Buddha of seeking to annihilate the long-established conventions of paying hom age to elders, etc,, but the Buddha spoke with reference to the annihilation of all defilements and unwholesome qualities by the four noble paths. 1643 Jegucchi bhavam Gotamo. Mp: "The brahm in calls the Blessed One a 'repeller' (jegucchi); he thinks that because the Buddha is repelled (jigucchaii) by polite conduct such as paying hom­ age to elders, he does not do such things. But the Blessed One acknowledges this in a metaphorical sense. He is repelled by bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct and by the various bad unwholesom e qualities, just as a man fond of ornam ents would be repelled and disgusted by feces." 1644 Venayiko bhavam Gotamo. Venayika, from the verb vineti (to disci­ pline, to remove), can mean "one who imposes discipline, one w ho trains others." Butin the Buddha's time the w ord venayika also seems to have acquired the m eaning of "one who leads astray," who leads others to destruction. Thus Mp glosses vineti, in the brahmin's view, with vinaseti, "destroys." But the Buddha affirms this in the sense that he teaches the Dhamma for the rem oval of lust and other defilements ( ragadlnam vinayaya). 1645 Tapassi bhavam Gotamo. A tapassi is usually an ascetic devoted to self-torment. The word is derived from the verb tapati, "to bum up, to heat up." The brahmin, according to M p, uses the word in the sense of one who torments elders by not showing proper respect to them. But the Buddha uses the term to m ean that he bum s up unwholesome qualities. 1646 Apagabbho bhavam Gotamo. SED explains Skt apagalbha as "w ant­

 1649 I do not follow Ce, which here includes ditthasava, the taint of
 views, absent in Be or Ee. The parallel passages in Ce at 3:59, 4:198, etc., do not include ditthasava.
 1650 It is strange that M ahavlra (the Nigantha Nataputta) is depicted
 as making such a statement! The Jains certainly must have known that the Buddha also taught a doctrine of kamma, though dif­ ferent from their own. M p says that Nataputta was extrem ely displeased at Slha's request and thought to prevent him from going. His words "destroyed the joy that had arisen in Siha, as if striking a stray.bull with a stick, extinguishing a burning lamp, or turning over a bow l of food." 1651 I read with Be and Ee: yahnunaham anapaloketva va nigantheT as against Ce yannunaham anapalokita va niganthe. In the previous sentence, with nigantha as subject, the past participles apalokita va anapalokita va are appropriate as nominatives in. agreem ent with the subject. In this sentence, where aham is the subject, an absolutive signifying an act of Siha is preferable. 1652 See p. 1646, note 416. 1653 In 8:i l accusations §§1, 3 -7 are leveled against the Buddha. 1654 Ce and Be have assasako; Ee reads assattho, which means "con ­ soled." I am not quite sure how this is intended as a criticism. 1655 Mp: " Supreme consolation (paramena assase.na): the four paths and four fruits." 1656 W hat follows here, up to "and become independent of others in the teaching Of the Teacher," closely matches Upali's experience; at MN 5 6 .1 6 -1 8 ,1 379,2-380,10. 1657 This charge is also addressed at 3:57. 1658 Ce and Ee jirantv, Be jiridanti. Mp: "They do not limit their slan­ der (abbhakkhanassa antam na gacchanti). Or else, this w ord jiri­ danti m eans sham e (lajjanatthe). The meaning is that they are not ashamed (na lajjanti)." 1659 See the Jlvaka Sutta (MN 55) for the Buddha's position on meat- eating. It is curious, indeed almost disingenuous, that the Bud­ dhist texts depict the Jains as criticizing the Buddha for eating meat from an anim al killed especially for him. This charge plays right into the Buddhists' protest that the Buddha is being slan­

But as the Jains were strict vegetarians, we can be almost certain that they criticized the Buddha and his disciples, not for having an animal killed for their meal, but sim ply for consuming meat. On the Jain prohibi­ tion of meat-eating, see h ttp :/ / www.jainworld.com/jainbooks/ guideline / 28. htm . 1660 In Ee, so rato should be read without the hiatus as sorato. 1661 Also at 2:5. 1662 Pitthito ratham pavatteti.

It breaks the triple rod, the three rods in front of the chariot." 1664 Rathisaya satthim ussajjitva rathrsamyeva ajjhomaddati. Mp: "H av ­ ing lowered its head, it throws the yoke to the ground and strikes the chariot pole with its thigh and crushes the chariot pole with its two front feet." . 1665 I follow Ce and Ee, -which here and below read patodam, as against Be patodalatthi, "goad and whip." 1666 Anutthanamala ghard. Lit., "Houses have lack of initiative as their stain." Mp: "The stain of houses is the lack of initiative, the absence of energy." Mp-t: "This is said because a house goes to ruin if one does not repeatedly take the initiative in repairing what has decayed and so forth." 1667 The verses are at Dhp 241^13ab. Dhp 243cd adds: "H aving abandoned these stains, be stainless, O bhikkhus" (etam malam pahatvana nimmald hotha bhikkhavo). 1668 Vanabhahgena. Lit., "by what is broken [from] the w oods." Mp: "By a present, such as flowers or fruits, which are taken from the woods and brought to h im /' 1669 I translate on the basis of Ce and Ee. Be, in this sutta and the next, has a different eight m eans of binding, occurring in a different sequence, nam ely: by weeping, by a smile, by speech, by appear­ ance, by a present, by scent, by taste, by touch (runnena, hasitena, bhanitena, dkappena, vanabhahgena, gandhena, rasena, phassena). Thus, apart from the change of sequence, Be replaces "form " and "singing" of Ce and Ee with "scent" and "taste." According to Mp, "appearance" (akappa) means "the manner of dressing and so forth," but this m ay be too narrow. The Chinese parallel at EA II 765c24-766a2 lists nine ways a woman binds a man: by singing; dancing, her skills, her touch, her smile, weeping, an expedient means, beautifying her face and body, and her appearance and

 1670 I read with Ce and Be subaddha yeva phassena baddha. Ee has a variant reading here and in the next sutta: subaddha yeva pdsena baddha, "[they are] thoroughly bound who are bound by a snare." 1671 Tills last phrase is com m only rendered "with a sudden drop-off only after a long stretch." But the Pali na ayataken’eva papdto, with the negative particle na, actually means the opposite: that there is no sudden drop-off. See DOP svayatakii, instr. dyatakena, "su d ­ denly, abruptly; of a su d d en /' Mp explains: ''It doesn't drop off at once like a steep precipice or deep pit. Beginning at the shore, it grows deeper by inches, feet, yards, [and successively longer measures] until it is 84,000 yojanas deep at the base of M ount Sineru/' 1672 The first three are legendary fish of gigantic size.. 1673 Anupubbasikkhd, anupubbakiriyd, anupubbapatipada. I take these to be truncated instrum entals relative to anndpativedho. Mp glosses them with anupubbasikkhaya, etc. Mp correlates each term with a set of training factors: "By gradual training the three trainings are included (see 3:89); by gradual activity, the thirteen ascetic practices (see Vism chap. 2); and by gradual practice, the seven contemplations, the eighteen great insights (see Vism 6 9 4 ,3-27, Ppn 22.113), the thirty-eight meditation objects, and the thirty- seven aids to enlightenment. Penetration to final knowledge occurs ... not abruptly (na dyataken'eva anndpativedho): there is no penetra­ tion to arahantship all at once (adito va) like the hopping of a frog, without having fulfilled virtuous behavior and so forth. One is able to attain arahantship only after having fulfilled in due order (patipatiya) virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom ." See too MN 1 479. 1674 Na tena nibbdnadhatuya unattam va purattam va pannayati. Mp: "W hen no Buddhas have arisen in countless eons, it is not pos­ sible for even one being to attain nibbana. Yet one cannot say, 'The nibbana elem ent is em p ty/ And during the time of a Bud­ dha, when countless beings attain the deathless at a single assem ­ bly, one cannot say, 'The nibbana element has become fu ll/" 1675 An unabridged version of this sutta, with a verse attached at the end, is lid 5:5, 51-56. It is also at Vin II236-40, where it serves as the background story to the rules about suspending a bhikkhu's right to participate in the Patimokkha recitation. 1676 I read with Ce dgamessati, as against Be and Ee dgamissati. 1677 At 1:253 he is declared the foremost among those who give what is agreeable.

###### precepts, but with ''abstinence from sexual activity" replacing "abstinence from sexual misconduct" as the third precept. 1679 As at 7:53 §7. W ith this he declares himself a non-returner. 1680 This is an alternative w ay of declaring oneself to be a non­ returner. By saying that he will not return to "this w orld" (imam lokarn) he indicates that he has eliminated the five low er fetters, which bind one to this world of sensual desire, and also that he is not yet an arahant, who does not return to any state of being. 1681 While Hatthaka is said to be dwelling in a residence (nivesana). unlike the preceding two lay followers, he is not addressed here as "householder" (gahapati) but as "friend" (avuso). W hether this is intentional or a transmission error is impossible to determ ine. At 6:123, how ever, H atthaka is referred to as a householder (gahapati) w hereas som e of the other lay disciples in this vagga are called lay followers (updsaka). 1682 The text repeats everything from the bhikkhu's going to H at- thaka's house up to the end of their conversation. 1683 Mentioned at 4:32 and 4:256. 1684 DaUddassd kho no tatha sotabbam mafinanti. Mp: "They do not listen to me as they w ould to a poor man, who cannot give anything or do anything; but they think they should listen to m e and follow m y advice and do not think they should transgress m y instructions." 1685 Jlvaka w as the Buddha's personal physician. For his background story, see Vin I. 268-80. 1686 It seems that the two Pali words ujjhatti and nijjhatti are being intentionally played off against one another. Mp glosses ujjhat- tibala with ujjhanabala and explains: "For fools have only the power of com plaining; 'W hen that fellow said this and that, he said it to m e, not to anyone else.' But [the wise] have the pow er of inference, of inferring w hat is beneficial and what is harmful: 'This is not so, hence it is that.'" On nijjhatti and its verb, nijjhapeti, see 2:51. 1687 Reading with Ce vavakattham, rather than vivekattham w ith Be and Ee. Vavakattha is past participle of vavakassati.

Mp: "One gives a gift w hen someone has arrived. Having seen one who has com e, one instantly makes him sit down, honors him, and gives him a gift.

###### Mp: "For the purpose of ornam enting and equipping the mind with serenity and insight." 1699 It is likely that this sutta w as originally a verse attached to the preceding one, which at som e point was broken off and treated as separate. In its present form, it contains no set of eight factors to account for its inclusion in the Eights. 1700 Danavatthuni. Mp: danakaranani, "causes for giving." 1701 Reading with Be and Ee bhaya danam deti; Ce has garahd danam . deti, "one gives a gift from criticism ," perhaps with the implica­ tion "from fear of criticism/" 1702 In translating these verses, I alternate between "accomplishment" and "excellence" as renderings for sampada, and "accomplished" and "excellent" as renderings for sampanna. In each case I have let m y sense of natural English dictiondeterm ine the appropriate choice. 1703 The text has tassa tarn cittam, but "aspiration" works better here than "mind" for cittam. . 1704 I read with Ee hlne 'dhimuttam (= hlne. adhimuttam), shared by a Siamese edition. Ce and Be have hlne vimuttarn, wliich must have been the reading in Mp. Mp.-t glosses: "Released upon is resolved upon, which means 'bent on, inclining tow ard, leaning tow ard'" (■vimuttan ti adhimuttam, ninnam ponarn pabbharanti attho). Mp: "The inferior (hlna) is the five objects of sensual pleasure." 1705 Vltardgassa, no sardgassa. This is added, because rebirth in the brahma world requires m ore than the practice of generosity. It must also be supported by the attainm ent of jhana, which arises through the fading aw ay of craving for sensual pleasures. 1706 See 5:148. The only com m on factor between the five qualities mentioned there and those listed here is giving at the proper time. 1707 This is an expanded parallel of 5:42, but with different verses. 1708 Mp glosses pubbe with pathamameva, but I suspect it is an abridg­ ment of pubbapeta, mentioned in the prose. I translate on the basis of this supposition. 1709 I read these verses as consisting of tw o six-pada stanzas and one four-pada stanza. Ce and Be both divide them into four four- pada stanzas. Ee does not divide them into stanzas. 1710 I read with Be and Ee natva dhamme ca pesalo, as against Ce natva dhamme'dha pesale. 1711 Apace brahmacarayo. Mp glosses as if apace represents apacayati, "to honor": brahmacdrino apacayati, mcavuttiiam nesam apajjati. How­ ever, DOP takes apaca to m ean "n ot cooking," and thus signify­ ing homeless.

Mp relates the origin of the present sutta thus: "It is said that those deities, hav­ ing examined their own glory, asked themselves: 'How did we obtain such glory?' Reflecting, they saw Anuruddha and knew: Tn the past, when he was a w heel-turning monarch, we were his consorts. We accepted his guidance and thus we have obtained this glory. Let's go.

O r the eight she herself pos­ sesses, and the [same] eight in w hich she enjoins others, make sixteen aspects." 1727 This sutta, the canonical account of the founding of the Bhikkhuni Sangha, has been the subject of extensive scholarly investiga­ tions. The narrative also occurs at Vin II 253-56. Several recent studies on the sutta, from a critical perspective, are in Mohr and Tsedroen 2010. Particularly instructive in this collection is Ute Husken, "The Eight G arudham m as," and Analayo, "Women's Renunciation in Early Buddhism: The Four Assemblies and the Foundation of the O rder of N uns," w hich treats the chronologi­ cal problem at pp. 86-90. 1728 The chronology is unclear to me. Mp says that at the time this sutta begins the Buddha w as living am ong the Sakyans during

###### the death of her husband, the Buddha's father Suddhodana, and that it seems improbable Sud dhodana died during the Buddha's first return visit to Kapilavatthu, w hich took place soon after his enlightenment, this fact is hardly credible. It would also lead to . an odd anachronism. The C ulavagga reports that Ananda and other prominent Sakyans becam e m onks after the Buddha's first journey to K apilavatthu (Vin II 182-83). Ananda became the Buddha's attendant tw enty years after the enlightenment, when the Buddha was fifty-five, and served the Buddha in this capacity for twenty-five years, right up until the end of his mas­ ter's life (Th 1041—43). In this sutta, how ever, Ananda is depicted as the Buddha's attendant before the founding of the Bhikkhuni Sahgha. WTiether this event occurred shortly after the Buddha's first return trip to Kapilavatthu, or even five or ten years later, it would still be too early for A nanda to be serving as his attendant. Thus, unless Ananda w as not actually the Buddha's attendant at the time, there seems to be a chronological tension between the situation depicted in the sutta and the likely period when women first obtained ordination. 1729 I summarize the sequence of events from Mp. When the Bud­ dha returned to Kapilavatthu, he gave the going forth to Nanda and Rahula and later resolved a conflict between the Sakyans and their neighbors, the Koliyans (the Buddha's relatives on his mother's side). Following this, 250 young men from each side left the home life under the Buddha. After a while, they began to pine for their wives. The Buddha brought them to the Kunala Lake, where he taught them the Kunala Jataka on the wiles and

 monks attained stream-entry and shortly afterward became ara­ hants. Their wives sent them messages entreating them to return home, but they replied that they were now incapable of living the household life. The women therefore went to Mahapajapati and asked her to request the Buddha, her stepson, to allow women to go forth. Mahapajapati took the women under her wing, went to the Buddha, and made this request. 1730 Mp: '"Why does he refuse her? Isn't it the case that all Buddhas have four assemblies? This, is true, but he refuses her with the thought that if women are given.permission to go forth only after they have made repeated efforts, they will maintain their ordina­ tion and revere it, recollecting how difficult it was to obtain the . going forth." 1731 These were the five hundred Sakyan women whose husbands . had gone forth and attained arahantship. In a personal com­ munication, Pruitt writes: "There's no indication of how much time elapsed between the Buddha's departure and what follows here. In ThI-a 3, [the commentator] Dhammapal.a says, 'He had the young Nanda and the young Rahula go forth and then the Teacher returned again to Rajagaha. On a later occasion, when the Teacher was living in the Kutagara Hall near Vesali, the great King Suddhodana attained final quenching [nibbana], having realized arahantship even while he was still [reigning] under the white parasol. The inclination to go forth arose in Maha-Pajapati' (Pruitt 1998: 6-7). This is also given at ThI-a 141 (Pruitt 1998:181). King Suddhodana.is the only layman I know of who became an arahant and remained a layman, which means he could not have lived more that seven days after becoming an arahant." 1732 Be has muhuttam, not in Ce or Ee. 1733 Atthagarudhamme. The termgarudhamma is ambiguous. The word garu normally means "heavy, weighty, grave," as for example in the expression garuka apatti, a grave or major offense. But garum karoti, lit., "to make weighty," means "to respect," and garukata, "respected." Thus garudhamma can mean either a "heavy, grave rule" or 'a rule to be respected, a principle of respect." Mp endorses the second interpretation: "The garudhammas are prin­ ciples that are to be treated with respect by the bhikkhunls who accept them." The translators of the Vinaya into Chinese also lean toward this interpretation. Thus in the corresponding passage in the Sarvastivada Vinaya (atT XXIII 345b29-c33) they are referred to as "eight principles of respect." The Mulasarvastivada Vinaya (for instance at T XXIV 350c29) calls them "eight principles of honor and respect." But the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya

 S§>£, "eight principles not to be transgressed throughout life," which corresponds to the Pali yavajwam anatikkainaniyo. And the MahTSasaka Vinaya (at T XXII 185ci9) likewise calls them $£}-&, "eight principles not to be violated." 1734 It is interesting to note how the subject of the discussion shifts almost imperceptibly from the going forth (pabbajja) of women to their full ordination (upasampada). The former refers simply to their leaving the household life, the latter to a formal act of admission into the Sahgha. 1735 Mahapajapati later asked the Buddha to permit bhikkhus and bhikkhunls to pay homage to one another (and show, other signs of respect) exclusively on the basis of seniority, without distinc­ tion of gender. The Buddha refused and issued a rule: "Bhikkhus should not pay homage to women, stand.up for them, salute them reverentially, or behave respectfully toward them. One who does so commits an offense of wrongdoing" (na bhikkhave matugamassa ubhivadanam pa.ccuttha.nani anjalikammam samicikammam katabbam; yo kareyya apatti dukkatassa).. The incident Is at Vin II 257-58. 1736 This refers to the three months7 fixed residence during the rainy season. 1737 Thus on the uposatha day a bhikkhu is assigned the task of giv­ ing the bhikkhunis an exhortation (ovada). See Thanissaro 2007b: 446-^7. 1738 The "invitation" (pavarana) is a ceremony held on the last day of the rains residence at which all the Sahgha members in order of seniority ask the others to point out any fault they may have committed, whether seen, heard about, or suspected. Each bhik­ khu Extends the invitation to all the other bhikkhus. By this rule, however, bhikkhunis are obliged to invite correction from both the bhikkhus and the other bhikkhunis. See Thanissaro 2007b: 447-48. 1739 The penalty period (manatta) is imposed on a monastic guilty of a sanghadisesa offense. During this period, the offending bhikkhu must undergo penalization for a period of six days; each day he must also inform all his fellow bhikkhus of his transgression, a humiliating experience. In the case of bhikkhunis, however, the penalty period lasts two weeks and must be observed in relation to both bhikkhus and bhikkhunis. For details, see Thanissaro 2007b: 358—73. In this rule, the word garudhamma has a different meaning from its use in relation to the eight principles as a set. Here, Mp glosses it as garukam sanghadisesapattim, that is, it is the breach of a sanghadisesa rule. Hiiskin (in Mohr and Tsedroen 2010, p. 144) conflates the two senses of the term and thus sees

 1740 A probationer (sikkhamana) is a woman candidate for full ordina­ tion who has already gone forth. To complete the requirements for ordination, she is obliged to live for two years observing a special training in regard to six rules (cha dhamma). The six rules—specified at Vin IV 319,24-29 in connection with Bhikkhuni Pacittiya 63—involve observing without transgression the precepts of abstinence from killing any living being, taking what is not given, sexual activity, false speech, intoxicants, and eating at an improper time (between midday and the following daybreak). Breach of any of these rules presumably requires the candidate to revert to the beginning of her two years' training. 1741 In the Vibhanga section of the Vinaya Pitaka, the rules of the Bhikkhuni Patimokkha are shown to have been laid down in response to specific incidents of misbehavior on the part of a cer­ tain bhikkhuni (or group of bhikkhunls). Several of these rules are already included among the garudhammas. Thus garudhammas 2, 3; 4; and 7 correspond to Bhikkhuni Pacittiyas 56, 59, 57, and 52. Garudhamma 6 has counterparts in Bhikkhuni Pacittiyas 63 and 64. The fact that the background stories to these rules show them originating at different points in the early history of the Bhikkhuni Sahgha casts doubt on the historicity of the present account, which shows the eight garudhammas being laid down at the very beginning of the Bhikkhuni Sahgha. If the eight garudhammas had been laid down at the birth of the Bhikkhuni Sahgha, they would have already been in force and there would have been no need for the Buddha to issue rules to prohibit the same undesirable behavior. He could simply have pointed to the existing rule. The fact that he did issue new rules thus collides with the thesis that the eight garudhammas were laid down at the very start of the Bhikkhuni Sahgha. 1742 For atimuttaka, DOP gives "a kind of shrub (perhaps Ougeinia oojeinensis)-, its flower." Rather than use an obscure Pali or Latin term, I freely render the name of the flower as "lilies." 1743 Assuming the historical authenticity of this passage, if the Bud­ dha had wished to proscribe the ordination of women, it seems he would likely have pointed out this danger to Ananda at the beginning of their conversation. Ananda would then have desisted from his effort and women would not have received the right to ordain. 1744 Corehi kumbhatthenakehi. Lit, "bandits who commit pot theft."

 and enters the middle of the reed. When the stalk is pierced, the sap comes out and cannot reach the top of the paddy plant." 1746 Manjitthika rogajati nipatati. Mp: 'The internal reddening of the sugar cane." 1747 Mp (Ce): "By this he shows the following: 'When a causeway is not built around a large reservoir, whatever water would have remained there if the causeway had first been built does not remain because there is no causeway. So too, these principles of respect have been prescribed in advance, before an incident has arisen, for the purpose of preventing transgression. If they had not been prescribed, then, because women have gone forth, the good Dhamma would have lasted five hundred years. But because they have been laid down in advance, it will continue another five hundred years and thus last for the thousand years originally stated.' And this expression 'a thousand years' is said with reference to arahants who have attained the analytic knowl­ edges (patisambhidapabhedappattakhlnasavanarn vasen'eva vuttam). Following this, for another thousand years, there appear dry- insight arahants; for another thousand years, non-returners; for another thousand years, once-returners; and for another thou­ sand years, stream-enterers. Thus the good Dhamma of pen­ etration (pativedhasaddhammo) will last five thousand years. The Dhamma of learning (pariyattidhammo) will also last this long. For without learning, there is no penetration, and as long as there is learning, there is penetration." From the above, we can see that according to the commentary, the allowance for women to go forth will not shorten the life span of the Dhamma; this is because the Buddha laid down the eight principles of respect, which serve as the dyke or causeway. 1748 This is evidently referring to the third garudhamma. Another anachronism appears here, at least in relation to the commen­ tarial chronology. The Bhikkhuni Sangha, on this chronology, was founded soon after the Buddha^s first visit to Kapilavatthu (or, on other chronologies, perhaps five or ten years after the enlightenment), yet it requires the bhikkhu who is to give the exhortation to have twenty years' seniority. This, of course, would not have been possible until at least twenty years after the founding of the Bhikkhu Sangha. By that time, however, Mahapajapati would likely have been too old to make the long journey to Vesali by foot. 1749 Also at Vin II258—59. The sutta mirrors 7:83. 1750 Though Ce spells the name "Vyagghapajja," I use this spelling to be consistent with the spelling of the name at 4:194. This must have been his clan name, Dlghajanu his personal name.

 1751 Ce and Ee udumbarakhadikam va; Be udumbarakhdd way a m. The intended meaning is obscure. Mp explains: "One wishing to eat figs might shake a ripe fig tree and with one effort knock down many fruits. He would eat the ripe fruits and depart, leaving behind the rest; just so, one who spends the greater part of his earnings enjoys his wealth by dissipating it, so it is said: 'This clansman eats his wealth just like an eater of figs."' A Chinese parallel, SA91 (T U23a22-ci7),readsatTIl23bi7: ° ° ^11 Mtk; "Everyone calls him a fig without seeds. The foolish man, a prey to craving, does not consider those who come after." 1752 Ce and Ee ajaddhumarikam; Be ajetthamaranam. DOP relates the compound to Skt jagdhva, "having eaten," and defines ajaddhurharika as "death by starvation." See PED $v jadd.hu, said to occur only as negative ajaddhu, "not eating, abstaining from food." Mp (Ce) glosses with anathamaranam, "death without a protector," Mp (Bre) anayakarmranam, "death without a leader." It seems Mp (Ce) is glossing the reading found in Be. The Chinese at T II 23bi9-2o has "Other people will all say that foolish man is like a dog starving to death." 1753 Akkhata saccandmena. The one "truly named" is the Buddha, since the name "Buddha" corresponds to his real stature as an enlight­ ened one. See too p. 1757, note 1320. 1754 An expanded parallel of 6:23. The additional designations for sensual pleasures are "dart" (salla) and "womb" (gabbha). The verses differ from those at 6:23. The whole sutta, with verses, is cited atNidd II 62,29-38 (VRI ed. 240). 1755 Ditthadhammikapi gabbha na parimuccati, samparayikapi gabbha na parimuccati. Mp: "The womb pertaining to the present life is a human womb; the womb pertaining to future lives is a womb other than the human." 1756 The usual phrase, "for the abandoning of unwholesome quali­ ties and for the acquisition of wholesome qualities," is omitted, perhaps deliberately because this bhikkhu is ah arahant. 1757 Text here has arahattaphalasqcchikiriyaya patipanno, whereas 8:19 has arahattayd patipanno. 1758 The verses are also at SN 11:16,1233. 1759 Pannasllasamahito.

"He takes up quickly, which means that when such subjects as the aggregates, elements, and sense bases are being taught, he understands them quickly" (khippam upadhareti, khandhadhatu-ayatanadisu kathiyamanesu te dhamme khippam janati). 1764 Dhamme ca bhasite mamanneva anubandhitabbam mannanti. Mp: "It. is said that although an exhortation was given [to him], this bhikkhu remained heedless. Having heard the Dhamma,he just hung around but did not want to strive. Therefore the Blessed One rebuked him. But since the bhikkhu had the supporting conditions for arahantship, the Buddha exhorted him with the words [below], 'Thus should you train yourself/" 1765 Mp: "This is the meaning: 'When, bhikkhu, you have developed this fundamental concentration of loving-kindness in such a way, you should not be satisfied merely with this much, but you should attain four and five jhanas [in the fivefold jhana scheme] in regard to other meditation objects. Thus you should develop it according to the method "with thought and examina­ tion" and so forth/" While, in the jhana scheme of the Nikayas, the transition from the first to the second jhana is marked by the simultaneous elimination of thought (vitakka) and examina­ tion (vicara), other texts distinguish samadhi as threefold: as with thought and examination, without thought but with examina­ tion, and without thought and examination (see DN 33.1.10, III 219,19-20; MN 128.31, III 162,13-ie; SN 43:3, IV 360,11-13). This middle stage of samadhi gave rise, in the Abhidhamma, to a fivefold scheme of jhanas that inserts, after the first jhana, a sec­ ond jhana that is without thought but with examination. This scheme then renumbers the second, third, and fourth jhanas of the fourfold scheme as“the third, fourth, and fifth jhanas to obtain a fivefold scheme. The samadhi with rapture (sappitika) includes the first and second jhanas (of the fourfold scheme); that without rapture (nippitika) includes the third and fourth jhanas.

Mp glosses obhasam as the "light of the knowledge of the divine eye" (dibba- cakkhunanobhasam). 1769 Mp: "Here, knowledge and vision (nanadassana) is the divine eye (idibbacakkhubhutarn)." 1770 Mp associates these eight facets respectively with the following eight kinds of higher knowledge: (1) the knowledge of the divine eye, (2) the knowledge of spiritual potency, (3) the knowledge encompassing the minds of others, (4) the knowledge of how beings fare in accordance with their kamma, (5) the knowledge of the future, (6) the knowledge of the present, (7) the knowledge of the past, and (8). the knowledge of past lives. Mp continues: "These are the eight knowledges that have come down in the text. But this sutta should be explained by conjoining these with the insight knowledges, the four path knowledges, the four fruition knowledges, the four reviewing knowledges, the four analytical knowledges, and the six knowledges unique to a Buddha." 1771 Abhibhayatanani. From the descriptions both in the text and com­ mentary, it seems that the "bases of overcoming" are actually approaches to the kasinas, described in detail in Vism, chaps. 4 and .5. Mp: "The abhibhayatanani are causes of overcoming (abhibhavanakaranani). What do they overcome? The adverse qualities and the objects. For they overcome the adverse quali­ ties opposed to them (patipakkhabhavena paccamka dhamme) and, through a person's superior knowledge, [they overcome] the objects (puggalassa nanuttariyataya arammanani)." 1772 Mp: "Percipient of forms internally (ajjhattam rupasanhi): This refers to the internal f©rm used for the preliminary work. For someone does the preliminary work [of meditation] on a blue, form, such as the head hairs, the bile, or the irises. Doing the preliminary work on a yellow form, he uses bodily fat, the skin, or the sur­ faces of the hands and feet, or a yellow area in the eyes. Doing the preliminary work on a red form, he uses flesh, blood, the tongue, or a red area in the eyes. Doing the preliminary work on a white form, he uses bones, teeth, nails, or the whites of the eyes. These are not perfectly blue, yellow, red, or white, but impure.

 who has obtained a mere spoonful of food collects it together, thinking, 'What is there to eat here?' and uses limited ability, so a person whose knowledge is emerging, one of clear knowl­ edge, thinks: 'What is there to attain in regard to a limited object? This isn't troublesome for me.' Having overcome those forms, he enters an attainment, and with the arising of the mark he reaches absorption. He is percipient thus (evamsanm hoti): He is percipient with the perception of reflective attention (abhoga) and with the perception of the jhana. 'I know, I see' (janami passami): By this, his reflective attention is spoken of; for that occurs after he has emerged from the attainment, not in the attainment itself. The perception of overcoming (abhibhavanasanna) exists in the attain­ ment, but the perception of reflective attention (abhogasanna) . occurs after he has emerged from the attainment." 1773 Mp: "As a hungry person who has obtained ample food does not see that meal as large but thinks: 'Give me seconds and thirds. What will this do for me?'so a person whose knowledge is emerging, one of clear knowledge, thinks: 'What is there to attain here? This isn't a measureless object. It isn't troublesome for me to obtain one-pointedness of mind.' Having overcome
 [those forms], he enters an attainment, and with the arising of the mark he reaches absorption." 1774 Mp: "One not percipient of forms internally sees forms externally (iajjhattam arupasannl eko bahiddha rilpani passati): This describes one for whom the preliminary work and the mark have arisen externally. Thus both by wa)^ of the preliminary work and by way of absorption, he is called one who is not percipient of forms internally [but] sees forms externally." 1775 Mp: "From the fifth base of overcoming On, he shows their thor­ ough purification. For these bases are stated by way of purified colors (visuddhavannavasen'eva)." The colored bases of overcom­ ing are illustrated by similes below, at 10:29, as well as at DN 16.3.29-32,11110-11. 1776 The word vimokkha is used here in a specific and limited sense and does not imply irreversible liberation of the mind from all defilements; this latter is usually indicated by akuppa cetovimutti or cetovimutti pannavimutti. Mp: "In what sense are they eman­ cipations? In the sense of releasing (adhimuccanatthena). In what sense releasing? In the sense of thoroughly freeing from adverse qualities, and in the sense of thoroughly freeing through delight in the object.

Mp: "Here, 'form' is the jhana with a form object, which has arisen by way of a blue kasina, etc., based on something internal such as head hairs, etc. One who gains this
 [jhana] is said to possess form. One might also see forms with the eye of jhana externally, such as a blue kasina, etc. What is indicated by this are the four form-sphere jhanas in the case of a person who has attained jhana through the kasinas with an internal or external basis." 1778. One not percipient of forms internally sees forms externally (ajjhattam arupasanm, bahiddha rupani passati). Mp: "One who is not percipi­ ent, of forms internally is one who does not attain form-sphere jhanas based on Iris own head hairs, etc. What is shown by this are the form-sphere jhanas of one who attains jhana externally, having done the preliminary work externally." .1779 Subhant'eva adhimutto hoti. Mp: "By this'what is shown are jhanas based on extremely purified color kasinas, such as blue, etc. " Mp points out Lhat Patis, a canonical exegetical treatise, defines the emancipation on the beautiful as the four immeasurable states (loving-kindness, compassion, altruistic joy, and equanimity); see Patis II 39,14-26. It seems that the first emancipation comprises the first two bases of overcoming; the second, the second two bases of overcoming; and the third, the remaining four bases of overcoming. 1780 On the cessation of perception and feeling (sannavedayitanirodha), see MN 43.25, I 296,5-23; MN 44.16-21, 301,30-302,27; SN 41.6, IV 293-95; Vism 702-9, Ppn 23.16-52. 1781 Obtained by combining the four of 4:250 and the four of 4:252. 1782 Obtained by combining the four of 4:251 and the four of 4:253. 1783 Also at DN 16.3.21-23, I I 109-10. 1784 This passage, which shows the Buddha as a master of bodily transformations, seems to have proto-Mahayanistic features. Mp comments: "Whether the others are white, black, or brown, the Teacher is golden-colored. But thip is stated with reference to shape. And the shape alone is perceived by them. It is not the case that the Blessed One becomes like a foreigner or like one wearing pearl earrings; he sits there in the form of a Buddha. But they see him as having the same shape as themselves. Some speak with a broken voice, some with a cackling voice, some with the voice of a crow, but the Teacher always has the voice of Brahma. This is stated with reference to the language. For if the Teacher is sitting in a king's seat, they think, 'The king speaks sweetly

 see the [real] king arrive, they wonder: 'Who was that?'... Even though they investigate, they do not know. Then why does the Buddha teach the Dhamma to them if they do not know? To plant impressions (vasanatthaya). For when the Dhamma is heard even in such a way, it becomes a condition for the future. Thus he teaches out of consideration for the future." 1785 The portion of this sutta as far as the verse is also at SN 51:10, V 258—63. The entire sutta is at DN 16.3.1—20, II102—9. 1786 Kappam va tittheyya kappavasesam va. Mp glosses kappa, "eon,", as ayukappa, "the life eon," the full normal life span of human beings at a particular time, presently a hundred years. Kappavasesa, "the remainder of the eon," is explained as a little more than the nor­ mal life span of a hundred years. Mp mentions the view of an elder named Mahasiva, who held that the Buddha could live on for the rest of the cosmic eon, but Mp cites the old commentary as holding that the "life eon" alone is intended (idameva atthakathaya- niyamitam). Nevertheless, nowhere else in the Nika}ras is kappa used in the sense of a normal human life span, and there seems no compelling reason to ascribe to the word as used here a mean­ ing different from the usual one, that is, a cosmic eon. 1787 Yatha tam Mdrena pariyutthitacitto. Mp: "As any worldling would not be able to pick up a hint, so Ananda was unable to pick it up. For Mara can obsess the mind of anyone who has not entirely abandoned the twelve cognitive inversions (vipalldsa- see 4:49), and Ananda [being only a stream-ienterer] still had four of them.
 [Mp-t; The inversions of perception and thought that take the unattractive as attractive and the painful as pleasurable.] Mara obsessed his mind by displaying a frightful sight. On seeing this, the elder failed to pick up the clear hint given him by the Buddha." 1788 Interestingly, in the Nikayas no such conversation between the Buddha and Mara is recorded as having taken place earlier in the Buddha's life. It is referred to only in this sutta and its parallels at DN 16.3.7-8, II 104-6, and SN 51:10, V 260,29-262,n. 1789 The expression pattayogakkhema, "attained to security from bond­ age," is in all three editions of AN but is absent from some (but not all) editions of the text's parallels in DN and SN mentioned in the preceding note. Since the phrase normally denotes the attainment of arahantship, it seems out of place in a description of the lay disciples.

Mp-t elaborates: "They explain the Dhamma in such a way that the doctrines of others are demol­ ished and their own doctrine is established; thus, by citing rea­ sons, it brings attainment of the goal [to be] achieved" (yatha paravadam bhanjitva sakavado patitthahati, evam hetudaharanehi yathadhigatamattham sampadetva dhammam kathessanti). My rea­ son for translating sappatihfiriya as "antidotal" is explained on p. 1673, note 586. 1790 Ayusahkharam ossaji. Mp: "Having thoroughly set up mindful­ ness, having limited it by knowledge, he discarded, abandoned, his vital force. The Blessed One did not relinquish his vital force in the way one drops a clod of earth with one's hand, but he resolved, T will enter fruition attainment for only three more months but not beyond that/" 1791 The verse is difficult, especially the first couplet. It is commented on identically by Spk III 254—55, Sv II557—58, Mp IV 153—54, and Ud-a 329-30. The commentaries offer two interpretations, one . taking tulam and atulam as opposites, the other taking tulam as the short present participle (= tulento) and atulam arid sambhavam as the opposites. I adopt the second interpretation. For a fuller discussion of the verse, see CDB 1941-44, note 255. 1792 Ce and Ee have kampeti, sahkampeti, sampakampeti. Be adds a fourth verb, sampavedheti, which might be rendered "makes [it] shudder." Just below, non-causative counterparts of the three verbs occur in Ce and Ee: kampati, sankampati, sampakampati. Be has a fourth, sampavedhati. 1793 An expanded parallel of 6:19. The additional sections are on liv­ ing for half a day and for the time needed to eat half a meal. 1794 An expanded parallel of 6:20. 1795 The eight accomplishments (sampada) and their definitions are as in 8:54, but without the section on the four dissipations of wealth. 1796 An expanded parallel of 6:31 and partly of 5:90 and 7:26. 1797 An expanded parallel of 5:24, 6:50, and 7:65. 1798 Tathagatam dhammadesana patibhati. Here I render this peculiar Pali idiom in accordance with the context as "is disposed to teach." Literally, it would be rendered "a Dhamma teaching shines upon [or 'occurs to'] the Tathagata/' 1799 Ekantapatibhana tathagatam dhammadesana hoti. 1800 A distinction between sambhava (in question 2) and samudaya (in question 3) is hard to pinpoint, since in the suttas the two words are often used almost synonymously. Mp derives samudaya from the verb form samudenti and glosses this with rasl bhavanti, "to accumulate to become a heap "

 1801 Brahmali (in a private communication) offers a fine explana­ tion of this cryptic sutta: "I understand sabbe dhamma to be a reference to the world of personal experience. The meaning would then be as follows: All elements of our experience are rooted in desire (chandamulaka) in the sense that we exist due to desire (taking chanda as equivalent to craving). They come into being through attention (manasikarasambhava) in the sense that we only experience what we attend to. They originate from contact (phassasamudaya) because without contact we don't experience, anything at all. They converge upon feeling (vedanasamosarana) in the sense that feeling is the most important aspect of our expe­ rience, the basic.motivating factor in everything we do. They are headed by. concentration (samadhippamukha) in the sense that concentration is a controlling faculty (an indriya) whose lead all elements of our experience must follow. They are under the authority of mindfulness (satadhipateyya) because mindfulness is another controlling faculty which directs us in whatever we dp. or experience. All things have wisdom as supervisor (pannuttara). because wisdom is the chief of the controlling faculties; wisdom, more than anything else, controls our experience (the last three factors are what allow us to get a sense of being in charge.of our lives). That liberation is their core (vimuttisara), the most excellent of all things, is self-explanatory." 1802 Mp clarifies some of these points. (1) An unskilled thief attacks those who should not be attacked; such as old people, children, and virtuous people who are not his enemies and who don't attack him. (2) A skillful thief should take only half of what is available; for example, if there are two articles of clothing he should take only one; of portions of food, he should take one for himself and leave the other (he can take the superior item for himself). (7) An unskilled thief commits theft in a nearby village, town, or city. (8) An unskilled thief does not purify the path to the other world by "depositing" a portion of his spoils in gifts.to those "worthy of offerings" (yam laddham, tam dakkhineyye nidahitum cheko na hoti, paralokamaggam na sodheti). Presumably a skillful thief will "deposit" part of his plunder by offering it to worthy monks and thereby "purify the path to the other world." 1803 f follow Ce here. Be and Ee put vedagii bef<pre bhisakko. 1804 The verse as preserved seems incomplete because the rela­ tive clauses beginning with yam are not explicitly completed by a demonstrative clause.

 vijitasahgamo refers precisely to this, and I have thus added "over that" in brackets. 1805 Ce paramo danto; Be paramadanto; Ee paramam danto. The gloss in Mp, paramadamathena dantatta paramadanto nama, suggests that parama qualifies danto, not nago as in Ce. 1806 The opening framework of this sutta is the same as that of 5:30 and 6:42 but the content of the discourse partly differs. 1807 In what follows, factors §§4-7 are identical with §§1-^1 of 6:42. In Ce and Ee, §§5-6 of 6:42 are excluded from this sutta, but the last sentence of 6:42, not a numerical factor there, here becomes
 • §8. Be includes §§5-6 of 6:42, which then become §§8-9- The final sentence of the sutta would then either be unnumbered or counted as §10. If Be is followed, it is hard to account for this sutta being in the Eights rather than in the Nines or Tens. §§1—3 of the present sutta have no counterparts in the previous versions. BraJhmali suggests numbering the sentence that begins "Even some deities" as §1 and treating the final sentence of the sutta as unnumbered, which would be consistent with 6:42. However, I here follow the numbering of Ce, my primary source text. 1808 The Ce reading here agrees more closely with the Be reading of 6:42 than with the Ce reading of the latter. But here Ce has the verb paccessati, "to return" (absent in Ce 6:42), whereas in both suttas Be has upatthahissati, "will serve." Ee's saccessati is likely to be a misreading of paccessati. This version has no mention of sahadhammika, a co-religionist, as in 6:42. 1809 Pattam nikkujjeyya. The procedures of overturning the alms­ bowl and turning it upright are authorized at Vin II124-27. See Thanissaro 2007b: 411—12. Mp: "May overturn.the almsbowl on him: They do not actually turn the almsbowl upside down in front of him, but they enact the motion of 'overturning the almsbowl,' which means that they do not accept gifts from this person. Simi­ larly, they might decide to abolish this act by enacting a motion to turn the.bowl upright (ukkujjeyya), which entitles them to receive his gifts again." This procedure was used in Burma dur­ ing the tumultuous period of late 2007 when the monks decided that the behavior of the military junta toward the Sangha merited such a penalty. The; monks walked down the streets with their bowls actually turned upside down to express disapproval of the rulers' actions. 1810 Appasada.

 1812 Palisaraniyakamma. When this is imposed, the bhikkhu must go to the householder, accompanied by another bhikkhu, and apolo­ gize to him. If he fails to win the householder's forgiveness, his companion should try to reconcile them. The background story is at Vin II15-18, with the legal stipulations at Vin II18-21. For details, see Thanissaro 2007b: 407-11. 1813 Tassapapiyasikaknmma. The grounds for this penalty are discussed at Vin II85-86. See/ too, Thanissaro 2007a: 549-51, where it is ren­ dered "further-punishment transaction." According to the origin story, this penalty is imposed on a bhikkhu who speaks evasively or reacts aggressively when charged with a grave offense (an offense of the sanghadisesa class) and then admits to it only under pressure. 1814 See pp. 1732-33, note 1085. 1815 Na ca tena mulena vutthdpetabbo. Mp says: "He does not get to do an act of rehabilitation [in a case] that takes that root" (tam mulam katva abbhanakammam katum na labhati). The exact meaning, is unclear. I follow Brahmaii's suggestion that mula here is "the root offense," that is, the original offense that led to the formal charge of aggravated, misconduct. 1816 Ee does not number this chapter or the suttas it contains. Ce and Be number it X (or 10), continuing the consecutive numbering scheme used for the earlier vaggas in this nipata. Ce numbers the suttas 1-27, Be 91-116. The difference in number stems from the addition of one Lay woman mentioned in Ce and Ee (which I follow) but missing in Be. 1817 The editions differ in the extent to which they attach epithets to the personal names of the women. Ce has the/greatest num­ ber; some may be late additions. Ee attaches upasikd only to Khujjuttara, Samavati, and Suppiya; Be attaches it to these three and to Bojjha. The designations rajakuman (princess) and devi (queen) are found only in Ce. I have been irregular in my treatment of the word mata pertaining to a woman's identity. When it follows another name occurring in the genitive, I trans­ late it "mother." When it is the last part of a compound, as in Migaramata, I leave it untranslated, assuming it was probably part of the woman's actual name-in-use and not merely a way of indicating her identity. Mp says that all these suttas should be elaborated by way of the undertaking of the uposatha obser­ vance complete with the eight factors. Thus presumably they should all be modeled on 8:42. At 8:43 and 8:45 we already find this for Visakha and Bojjha respectively. 1818 This name is omitted in Be, which accordingly has only twenty-

 1819 She is probably identical with Velukantaki Nandamata. See p. 1610, note 141. 1820 Ee does not number this vagga. Ce and Be number it XI (or 11), continuing their consecutive numbering schemes. As with the Book of Sevens, I have numbered it as if it were a sixth chap­ ter in this set of fifty. Ce numbers the suttas in the series from 1—510. Be numbers the suttas in continuation with those in the entire nipata, from 117 to 626.1 follow the sutta numbering of Be, though my count starts and ends one number higher because of the additional female lay follower in the previous vagga (absent in Be).

 1821 This is a composite nine, obtained by combining the five proxi­ mate causes and the four meditation subjects. 1822 The. conceit- "JL am" (qsmimana) is more subtle than personal- existencevievf(sakfcayaditthi): Both are removed by the perception of non-self, but whereas the stream-enterer eliminates personal- existence view, only the arahant eliminates the conceit "I am." On this point see SN 22:89, III 130,8-131/31. It seems that personal- existence view has a stronger conceptual underpinning than the conceit "I am," which is more closely connected to existential need and therefore can be eliminated only at arahantship. 1823 Mp: "When the characteristic of impermanence is seen, the char­ acteristic of non-self, is seen. Among the three characteristics, when one is seen, the other two are also seen. Thus it is said: 'When one perceives impermanence, the perception of non-self is stabilized/" Mp-t, commenting on 9:3, says: "One who perceives impermanence (aniccasannino): one who perceives impermanence by way of the contemplation of impermanence, which occurs thus: 'All conditioned phenomena are impermanent' because they cease to be after having existed; because they arise and van­ ish; because they are fragile; because they are temporary; and because they exclude permanence. The perception of non-self is s tabilized (anattasanna santhati): the perception of non-self consists in the contemplation of non-self, which occurs thus: 'All phe­ nomena are non-self' because they are coreless; because we have no mastery over them; and because they are alien, void, hollow, and empty. This perception is stabilized, firmly established in the mind." 1824 This is another composite nine, arrived at by combining the five means of support with the four reliances.

 patitthasampanno, “possessed of a foundation/' which suggests it refers to the supporting conditions for attaining arahantship. 1826 These are the five trainee's powers (sekhabalani) of 5:1-2. 1827 Tam hi'ssa bhikkhuno akusalam pahlnam hoti suppahlnam, yamsa ariyaya panhaya disva pahlnam. This statement indicates that whereas the previous four abandonihgs are tentative and revers­ ible, the abandoning effected by wisdom is permanent and irreversible. 1828 These four are found among the six methods of abandoning the asavas explained at 6:58. See, too, MN 2,. where they are included among the seven methods of abandoning the asavas. 1829 Still another composite nine, arrived at by combining the five things that lead to the mind's maturation and the four meditation subjects, with the addition of a narrative framework. The sutta is also found as-Ud 4:1, 34—37; with an "inspired utterance" added.. 1830 Mp says that Calika was the name of a city and nearby was a mountain also called Calika. They had built a large monastery there and the Blessed One had been dwelling in the monastery, supported by the city.. 1831 Reading with Ce and Be agacchati, as against Ee dissatu/ "let be seen." 1832 Actually, what occurs."a second time" is only the request for permission, not the full statement. Mp: "There is nothing further to be done (natthi kind uttarim karanlyam): because the four func­ tions have been done respecting the four truths. And no [need] to increase what has been done (katassa va paticayo): no repetition of what he has attained. For the path ah-eady developed is not developed again, and there is no repeated abandoning of aban­ doned defilements." 1833 Mp: "In five hundred successive lives he had been a king. There had been a stone slab there where he used to sit. He had come accompanied by three troops of dancing girls to amuse himself in the park. From the time Meghiya sat down there, it seemed as if he were no longer a monk but a king sitting on a regal couch beneath a white parasol, surrounded by his retinue of dancing girls. As he enjoyed his splendor, sensual thoughts arose in him. Just then, he seemed to see two thieves who had been arrested by his men and brought before him. In ordering one to be executed, thoughts of ill will arose in him; and in ordering the other to be
 •imprisoned, thoughts of harming arose. Thus he was enveloped by those unwholesome thoughts like a tree by creepers, or like a honey-eater by honey bees." 1834 Mp: "Liberation of mind (cetovimutti): liberation of mind from

 respect (tadahgavasena) and by way of suppression. (vikkham- bhanavasena). In the subsequent phase, it is liberated by way of eradication (samucchedavasena) and by way of tranquilization (patipassaddhivasena). When the dispositions have been awak­ ened and matureid, insight gives rise to the path, and as insight reaches maturity, liberation of mind is said to have matured. But in their absence it has not yet matured." 1835 This is still another composite nine, obtained by joining the four attributes described by the Buddha with the five benefits in timely listening to the Dhamma. 1836 This begins like 8:71 but develops differently. 1837 Be has cetosamadhissa throughout, as against Ce and Ee ceto- samathassa. 1838 Adhipannadhammavipassana, glossed as "the insight knowledge that comprehends conditioned phenomena" (sahkharapariggahaka- vipassananana). 1839 I read here with Ee: tatha tatha'ssa sat tha piyo ca hoti manapo ca garu ca bhavaniyq ca. Ce and Be have tatha tatha so satthu .. .garu ca bhavaniyo ca, which means that the bhikkhu becomes respected and esteemed by the Buddha. 1840 Tatha tatha so tasmim dhamme atthapatisamvedl ca hoti dhamma­ patisamvedl ca; as at 5:26, III21-23. See p. 1724, note 990. Strangely, though the theme of this passage is the benefit in listening to and discussing the Dhamma, the second, third, and fourth benefits (and perhaps the first as well) accrue to the monk who is teaching. the Dhamma. 1841 Tatha tatha so tasmim dhamme gambhiram atthapadam pannaya ati- vijjha passati. See p: 1761, note 1346. 1842 This is still another composite nine, which combines the four powers with the transcending of five fears. 1843 . The explanation of "impartiality" given here may be puzzling. 'Samanattata is a compound of "equal" (samana) and "oneself" (attan). As applied to conduct, it means treating others as one would have them treat oneself, without bias or partiality. Here the word is being used to express the equality between those at the four levels of awakening, all with himself or herself. 1844 Although the text puts the subject in the singular, 1 have used the plural, which sounds more natural in English. The text uses the same future participle, sevitabbam (and its negation, asevitabbam), in relation to each subject, but I render it differently as best fits each particular case. The verb sevati, on which the participle is based, has a wide range of meanings and can support all these renderings.

 time at night, one should leave that very night. But if at night there is danger of attack by wild beasts, etc., one may wait until dawn. Having known [this] some time during the day, one should leave that very day. But if there is danger during the day, one may wait until sunset." 1846 I prefer Ee, which does not include sahkha pi, "having reflected," in the first alternative. Ce and Be both include sahkha pi in the first three sections. It seems, however, that reflection only becomes pertinent when there is tension between advantages and disad­ vantages; as in the second and third alternatives. Since the first alternative poses both material and spiritual disadvantages to staying, the proper choice is immediately evident and does not require reflection. MN 17,1104—8, which is partly parallel to this sutta, provides a check on the readings. MN 17.3 (in Ce, Be, and Ee readings; Ee at 1105,8-w) supports the absence of sahkha pi in . Ee text of AN. . 1847 I read here with Ee apuccha, as against Ce and Be anapuccha. MN 17.4, in Ce and Be, have apuccha, while Ee has neither (at 1 105,28- . 29). It would be proper for the bhikkhu to take leave of the person on whom he has been relying—his preceptor or teacher—since the person has at least been kind enough to provide for his mate ­ rial needs. Further, the omission here of the words rattibhagam va divasabhagam va, "any time night or day," suggests there must also be a difference in the manner of departing. 1848 Giribbaja, a name for Rajagaha, because of the surrounding mountains. 1849 Abhabbo khlnasavo bhikkhu sikkham paccakkhatum.This means, in effect, that he is incapable of giving up the monastic training and returning to lay life. I am following the reading of Ce. Be and Ee have the last four items of 9:8 here, and their version of the lat­ ter has the last four items of the present sutta. Hence in Ee, page 371 falls in 9:8 of the Ce version, following " a wrong course on account of fear." 1850 Gotrabhu. In his translation of Vism, where the word is used in a technical sense, Nanamoli renders it "change-of-lineage" (see Vism 672-75, Ppn 22.1-14). Mp explains this person—in accordance with the exegetical scheme of the commentaries— as "one with a mind of powerful insight that has reached the peak, the immediate condition for the path of stream-entry." Mp is here referring to the gotrabhu mind-moment in the cognitive process (cittavithi) of the path, the mental event that immediately precedes sotapattimaggacitta, the mind-moment of the path of stream-entry Since this scheme is relatively late and presupposes

###### to reveal the original meaning of gotrabhu. In the Nikayas, the word occurs infrequently. In the present sutta it seems to mean simply a virtuous monk or nun who has not reached the path of stream-entry. We find the plural form at MN 142.8, III 255,6-7: "But in the future, Ananda, there will be clan members, with ochre [robes around] their necks, immoral people, of bad char­ acter" (bhavissanti kho pan'ananda, anagatamaddhanam gotrabhuno kasavakantha dusslla pdpadhamma). In the latter passage it has a pejorative sense, referring to those who show merely the outer marks of a monastic without worthy inner qualities. 1851 Mp glosses dsajja with ghattetva, implying physical violence, and appatinissajja with akkhamapetva, '.'without asking pardon." Mp continues: "Why did he bear resentment [against Sariputta]? It is said that after the elder had paid homage to the Buddha, the edge of his robe hit the monk's body as he was walking away.... Because of this the monk became resentful, so when he saw the elder leaving with a large retinue, out of envy he thought to obstruct his journey; thus he spoke as he did." 1852 .Mp explains that if the Buddha had tried to exonerate Sariputta, the bhikkhu would have thought that the Teacher was taking the side of his chief disciple and not the side of a junior monk; thus he would have harbored hatred against the Buddha, too. By calling Sariputta and asking him about the matter, the Buddha will get Sariputta to exonerate himself. 1853 Khamamaham bhante tassa ayasmato sace mam so ayasma evam aha "khamatu ca me so ayasma" ti. As I understand this sentence, Sariputta is simply saying that he will pardon the accusing bhik­ khu if the latter asks him for pardon. Mp, however, explains this sentence otherwise: "The elder [Sariputta], having pardoned the . monk for his transgression, apologizes to him before the Bud­ dha." This explanation, it seems, has influenced the translation in Gradual Sayings: "Lord, I do pardon that venerable one, if he speak thus to me; and let him, too, pardon me" (4:252). It is also reflected in NDB 233: "I shall forgive him, Lord, if this revered monk asks for my pardon. Anti he, too, may forgive me." The text itself, however, says nothing about Sariputta offering an apology to his accuser, since he has done nothing that calls for an apology. Sariputta is not himself addressing these words to the monk; he is saying that the monk should address these words to him in order to obtain pardon. In other words, so far the'monk has apologized only to the Buddha, not to Sariputta. On prin­ ciple, Sariputta can only pardon the monk if the latter asks for pardon. The word ca, "and," occurs in the sentence to be spoken

 by the monk, presumably, to mean "in addition to the Buddha, let Sariputta also pardon me." 1854 As at 7:42. 1855 I read (twice) with Ce and Be ke ca, as against Ee keci. 1856 The contrast is between sa-upadisesam and anupadisesam. Mp glosses these respectively as sa-upadanasesam, "with a residue of clinging," and upadanasesarahitam, "devoid of a residue of cling­ ing." See 7:56, which also speaks about those with a residue remaining and those without residue remaining. 1857 Wherever Ce and Be read mattasokarl, "cultivates to a moderate extent," Ee has na paripurak&ri, "does not fulfill." 1858 Dhammapariyayo panhadhippayena bhasito. Mp: "He shows: Tt was spoken because of the question you asked/ But to dispel the desire and lust for further existence among these nine types of persons, he spoke the sutta: 'Bhikkhus, just as even a trifling amount of feces is foul smelling, so too I do not praise even a trifling amount of existence, even for a mere finger snap' (1:328). Not only is the destiny of these nine persons fixed (gati nibaddha), but the destiny is fixed for those families who have such fixed merit.as [taking] the three refuges and the five precepts, [giving] one ticket meal, one fortnight meal, one dwelling for the rains residence, one pond, one dwelling. Those families are similar to stream-enterers." 1859 Mp glosses samparayavedamyam as "kamma ripening in the next existence" (dutiye attabhave vipaccanakakammam). 1860 I translate following Be and Ee, which read dukkhavedaniyam.. Ce has sukhavedaniyam, presumably because of the difficulty in seeing why the practitioner would want his kamma to be felt as painful. 1861 Mp glosses paripakkavedaniyam as laddhavipakavararn, "[kamma] that, has gained the chance to yield results." Its opposite, aparipakkavedanvyam, is aladdhavipakavaram, "[kamma] that has not gained the chance to yield results." 1862 Mp-t: " Kamma to be experienced is [kamma] that has not yet started to ripen but which is capable of producing results when there is an assemblage of other conditions. Kamma not to be experienced is clas­ sified as ahosikamma, etc., which is incapable of ripening because of a deficiency of conditions" (vedanlyan tipaccayantarasamavaye vipakuppadanasamattham, na araddhavipakam eva; avedantyan ti paccayavekallena vipaccitum asamattham ahosikammadibhedam ) . The concept of ahosikamma, kamma that never obtains a chance to ripen, is derived from Patis II 78,2-10 (Be §234). See too CM A 205.

 1863 Mahakotthita asks Sariputta a total of ten questions and recei ves ten replies. It thus seems peculiar that this sutta is included among the Nines, yet there is no other indication of a numerical framework than the number of questions asked and answered. 1864 According to Mp, Samiddhi was Sariputta's pupil. See 8:83, where the Buddha asks and answers a similar series of questions. 1865 Mp: "Intentions and thoughts are thoughts that are intentions" (sahkappavitakka ti sahkappabhuta vitakka). This is said beca.use the two words, sahkappa and vitakka, are used almost interchange­ ably in the texts. 1866 Namaruparammana. Mp glosses: "With name and form as condi­ tion (namarupapaccaya). By this he shows that the four formless aggregates and the form dependent on the primary elements are the condition for thoughts." 1867 The sections of the sutta up to this point encompass all experi­ ence. §§5-7 refer to factors of the path; §8, to the fruit; and §9, to the ultimate goal. 1868 Mp: "When they have attained the fruit of liberation, they have attained the core" (phalavimuttim patva sarappat'ta honti). 1869 Amato gadha. Mp explains this with reference to the idea that the path and fruit take nibbana as object: "Having gotten a foothold in the deathless nibbana by [making it] an object, they are estab­ lished there" (arammanavasena amatam nibbanam ogahitva tattha patitthita). 1870 Abhedanamukhani. Lit., "orifices without breaks." Mp: "They are wound-orifices not made by anyone but originated solely by kamma." The nine are the two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, the mouth, the urinary passage, and the rectum. 1871 An expanded parallel based on 7:48 and more remotely on 5:61. • 1872 An expanded parallel of 7:13. 1873 Mp: "They do not rise up from their seats and come forth to greet one, as a way of humbling themselves, and nurturing the mind." 1874 Mp: "They do not pay homage with the five placements" (that is, with the head, feet, and hands placed on the ground). 1875 An expanded parallel of 8:41, the eight precepts augmented by the meditation on loving-kindness. 1876 Mp: "The Blessed One does not ask this with reference to alms given to the Sahgha of bhikkhus.

 the Buddha uses in his response suggest that alms to renunci­ ants were intended. It is possible this sutta was spoken at a time when Anathapindika's finances were low. Alternatively, given its legendary character, the sutta maybe in part a literary fiction composed for a didactic purpose. A Chinese parallel, MA 155, has virtually the same exchange as the Pali at T I 677a 12-13.

Just below the text will mention the five ways a good per­ son gives a gift, also at 5:147. 1878 Presumably it is the nine types of gifts that justify including this sutta in the Nines.

M p does not pro­ vide a gloss and PED does not offer a useful definition under any of those readings. But in PED sandana is defined as "cord, tether, fetter/' 1880 Mp glosses kamsupadl-idranani as rajatamayakhlrapaticchakani, "sil­ ver receptacles for the milk." I am not aware that kamsa can mean silver. DOP sv kamsa says that kamsupadharana can mean "yield­ ing a pailful of milk, or with a metal milking-pail." Mp adds that the horns of the milk cows were covered with sheaths of gold; people tied garlands of jasmine around their necks, attached ornaments to their four feet, spread an excellent jute cloth over their backs, and tied a golden bell around their necks. Such ways of adorning cattle, though less costly, are still practiced in India today. 1881 Mp says that conventionally one koti is twenty pairs of cloth, but here ten garments is meant. 1882 Annassa panassa khajjassa bhojjassa leyyassa peyyassa. Leyya, from lihati, to lick, could mean something to be licked, perhaps things like honey, molasses, and palm sugar. 1883 Mp: "The perception o f impermanence is strong insight that has reached the peak and is an immediate condition for the path" (a nicca sa n n a n ti maggassa anantarapaccayabhavena sikhapattn- balavavipassanam). 1884 Uttarakuru: the continent to the north of Jambudipa, perhaps Central Asia. 1885 Ce and Ee visesabhuno.

 conditions in Uttarakuru. My rendering is a guess based on the assumption this account is intended to explain visesabhuno. 1886 This sutta combines the three triads defined separately in 3:140- 42. Hence this may be considered a composite nine. We meet here the same divergence in readings in the second group of horses as we met earlier: Ce and Ee tayo assasadassa, as against Be tayo assaparassa. 1887 The text is abridged thus in all three editions. 1888 These are found, with elaborations, in the Mahanidana Sutta, at DN 15.9-18, II 58-61. 1889 The nine terms rooted in craving, with explanations from M p. in parenthesis, are: (1) pariyesana (the seeking of objects such as forms); (2) labha (the obtaining of objects such as forms); (3) vin- icchaya (when one has gained a profit, one makes judgments by thinking what is desirable and undesirable, beautiful and ordi­ nary, how much one will keep and how much give to others, how much use and how much save); (4) chandaraga (weak lust and strong lust, respectively, which arise toward the object thought about with unwholesome thoughts); (5) ajjhosdna (the strong conviction in "I and mine"); (6) pariggaha (taking possession by way of craving and views); (7) macchariya (unwillingness to share . with others), (8) arakkha (guarding carefully by closing doors and storing in boxes); (9) dartdadana, etc. (the taking up of rods, etc., for the purpose of warding off others): 1890 §§1-4 and 6-8 are included among the seven stations of con­ sciousness at 7:44. 1891 The three editions differ here. I follow Ce bhikkhuno cetasa cittam paricitam hoti. Ee has bhikkhuno cetasa cittam suparicitam hoti, Be bhikkhuno cetasa citam hoti. Citam occurs repeatedly in Be, so it is clearly intentional. Mp (Ce): "One round of the mental process is built up, increased, by another round of the mental process." (cittacarapariyayena cittacarapariyayo cito vaddhito hoti). Mp (Be) has cittavara -in place of cittacara-. 1892 All three editions have bhikkhuno cetasa cittam suparicitam hoti. But note that in Ee, Sariputta's statement on Devadatta's way of teaching does not differ from Ca'ndikaputta's statement just above. Both have suparicitam hoti. It is puzzling that the sutta seems to be approving of Devadatta's teaching. Normally we would expect him to be censured for proposing a distorted ver­ sion of the Dhamma-. Perhaps this incident occurred before Deva­ datta became schismatic. 1893 §§4-6 are, in Pali, asaragadhammam, asadosadhammam, asamohci- dhammam. Mp does not gloss them, but the point seems to be that for the arahant lust hatred and delusion are no loneer

 even capable of arising again. §§7-9 allude to the three realms of existence. 1894 As at 6:55, but with a different simile. 1895 Text says silayupo solasakukkuko, a stone pillar sixteen kukkus tall. According to DOP, a kukku is 45 cm, about half a meter. Thus the pillar would be about eight meters. 1896 Hie number of verbs differ among the editions. Ce, which I follow, has four: n'eva nam kampeyya na sahkampeyya na sampakampeyya na sampavedheyya (but Ce abridges the middle two directions and omits the last verb in relation to the final repetition, appar­ ently an editorial oversight). Ee has three: n'eva nam kampeyya na . sahkampeyya na sampavedheyya. Be uses only two verbs: n'eva nam sahkampeyya na sampavedheyya, but threein the simile at 6:55. 1897 Also at 5:179. 1898 On bhayam veram pasavati, Mp says that one obtains the peril of mental fright (cittutrasabliayam; this favors understanding bhaya as subjective fear rather than objective peril, though I think the latter is actually intended) and enmity as a person(puggalaveram), Spk. II 73,17-33, commenting on SN 12:41, gives a fuller explana-. tion: "Peril and enmity are one in meaning. Enmity is. twofold, external and internal. For if one has killed someone's father, the other thinks: 'They say he killed my father; 1 will kill him/ So the latter takes a sharp knife and pursues the former. The voli­ tion arisen in him is called the external enmity [in relation to the future victim]. But the other hears, 'He's coming to kill me' and decides: 'I'll kill him first.' This is called the internal enmity [in relation to himself]. They both pertain,to this present life! When the warden of hell sees the murderer reborn in hell, the volition arises in him: 'I'll take a blazing iron hammer and strike him': this is the external enmity pertaining to the future life. And the voli­ tion that arises in the victim, 'He's coming to strike me though I'm faultless; I'll strike him first/ is the internal enmity pertaining to the future life. The external enmity is what is called 'enmity as a person' in the [old] Commentary." 1899 Tam kut'ettha labbha. My translation of this idiom is not intended to be literal. The point is that one has no choice but to resign oneself to the situation. Mp: "'W hat can be done in regard to that person so that there would be no such harmful conduct? By what means is it possible to obtain this?' Having reflected: 'A person harms another because of the disposition of his mind/ one dispels resentment." 1900 SN 36:11, IV 217,4-16, speaks of the "progressive cessation of activities" (anupubbasahkharanam nirodha) in terms very similar

The subject rupasanna can be read as either singular or plural. 1902 Anupubbcivihara. Be merely lists their names, that is, "the first jhana, the second jhana," etc. Ce and Ee give the full formulas. .1903 Anupubbaviharasamapattiyo. It is uncertain whether, in this com­ pound, vihdrasamapaitiyp should be interpreted, as a dvanda ("dwellings and attainments"), or as a tappurisa ("attainments of dwellings"). Mp,. with its gloss anupatipatiya samapdjjitabbavihara, "dwellings to be attained in proper sequence," suggests it is a tappurisa. ■ - -
 •1904 I read with Be and Ee tinna, as against Ce nittanha, "without craving," which seems less satisfactory in this context. Mp (Be): "Crossed over, crossed over sensuality" (kdmdto'tinna).. . 1905 Tadangena. Mp: "In that particular respect: with respect to that jhana factor" (tena jhanangena): 1906 Upekkhasukha, Mp does not comment, but 1 take the compound to be a tappurisa rather than the dvanda "equanimity and pleasure." In the fourth jhana and beyond upekkha,equanimity, continues but it is no longer accompanied by sukha, pleasant feeling. 1907 Ce and Ee have the plural verb nirujjhanti here, but the singular nirujjhati in §§6-8. Be has the singular nirujjhati here as well. Again, the subject rupasanna can be read as either singular or plural. 1908 Mp identifies him as the elder Laludayi. 1909 Brahmali comments: "Since nibbana is 'extinguishment' (of suf­ fering), any partial extinguishment of suffering is a partial kind of nibbana." 1910 Though all three editions here read upe(k)khasahagata sannamana- sikara, I follow the Burmese and Sinhala manuscripts referred to in a note in Ee, which read upe(k)khasukhasahagata safinamanasikara. This fits better with the exposition in 9:33 §4 and 9:41 §4 than the reading upe(k)khasahagata in all three printed editions. 1911 Cited at Vism 153,17-154,8, Ppn 4.130, as testimony that one should first master the jhana one has just attained before attempting to enter the next higher jhana. 1912 Tam nimittam.

 context I understand the sense to be that he does not force him­ self to aim prematurely for the higher attainment but masters the preceding one before moving on to the next. 1915 Mp: "The characteristic of impermanence is stated by way of two terms: impermanent and disintegrating (aniccato, palokato). The characteristic of non-self is stated by way of three terms: alien (parato), empty (sunnato), and non-self (anattato). The character­ istic of suffering is stated by the other six terms: suffering (duk- khato), an illness (rogato), a boil (gandato), a dart (sallato), misery (aghato), and affliction (abadhato). 1916 Mp: "He directs the mind of insight (vipassanacitta) to the uncon­ ditioned deathless element by way of hearing, by way of praise, by way Of learning, and by way of concepts thus: 'Nibbana is. peaceful/ He directs the mind of the path (maggacitta) to nibbana simply by making it an object (arammanakarancroasen'eva), not by saying,'This is peaceful, this is sublime.'The meaning is that he directs his mind there, penetrating it in this mode." 1917- Ten'eva. dhammaragena taya dlvzmmanandiya. Mp: "By desire and attachment to the Dhamma of serenity and insight. So too for 'delight in the Dhamma/ If he can fully exhaust desire and attach­ ment to serenity and insight, he attains arahantship. If not, he becomes a non-returner." Mp-t: "Having abandoned the desire and lust for serenity and insight leading to the lower paths, if he is unable to exhaust the desire for [serenity and insight] leading to the supreme path, he becomes settled in the stage of rion- returning."
 1918 See 4:181,4:196. 1919 Note that rupa, form, is omitted in describing the formless attain­
 ments. Mp: "In the formless attainment there is utterly no form; with reference to this, form is not included."
 1920 Mp: "Why is the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception
 not mentioned? Because of its subtlety: The four formless aggre­ gates in that [attainment] are so subtle that they are not suscep­ tible to exploration [by way of insight]. Hence [just below] the Buddha says: 'There is penetration to final knowledge as far as meditative attainments accompanied by perception reach/ This is meant: 'To the extent that there is an attainment accompanied by mind (sacittakasamapatti; citta here presumably means "clear and distinct cognition"), there is penetration to final knowledge when one explores [by insight] those gross phenomena, that is, one attains arahantship. But because of its subtlety, the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception is not called an attain­ ment accompanied by perception."

 Be. I follow Ce: jhayih'ete bhikkhave bhikkhuhi samapattikusalehi samapattivutthanakusalehisamapajjitva vutthahitva samakkhatabbam ti vadami. Ee basically agrees with Ce but prints jhayl h'ete, as if it had a nominative subject followed by emphatic hi. Mp: "Described means to be properly declared, to be explained, extolled, praised simply as 'peaceful and sublime'" (sa m a k k h a ta bb a m ti samma akkhatabbani, "santftni panitam" ti evam kevalam acikkhitabbani thometabbani vannetabbani). 1922 On the meaning of "confinement" (sambadha), see 9:42 below. 1923 This is the same as the well-known opening statement of the Satipatthana Sutta, at DN 22:1, II 290,s-n; MN 10.2,1 55,32-^56,2. It also occurs in AN at 3:74, 4:194. 6:26, and 10:95. 1924 Mp: "The eye itself., .will actually be present (tadeva nama cakkhum bhavissati): the sensitive substance of the eye is itself unimpaired. As well as those forms (te rUpa): that visible-form object itself will have come into range. A nd yet one does not experience that base (tancayatanam no patisatnvedissati): and yet one does not know that visible-form base." I may be wrong in assuming that the nine items are to be obtained by totaling the five kinds of sensory experience with the four formless meditations. Possibly the nine were to be obtained by including the four jhanas (which may have dropped out of the text) with the four formless meditations, and then adding, as the ninth, the special state of concentration referred to at the end of the sutta. 1925 Ce and Be both have ti here, indicating the end of a quotation, which suggests that the speaker of the next paragraph is Udayi. Yet it is clear that Ananda himself is still speaking. Thus, it seems, ti is an error and should be deleted from Ce and Be. Ee does not have ti. 1926 So Ce and Ee. Be has the name as Jatilavasika. Mp says that she was a resident of Jatila city (jatilanagaravasinl). The jatilas were matted-hair ascetics, but it is questionable whether they were ever numerous enough to constitute a city. 1927 Mp: " Does not leanforwardhy way of lust, and does not bend backby way of hatred" (ragavasena na abhinato, dosavasena na apanato). 1928 See 5:27. Here Mp comments: "It is steady, not because one has forcefully and vigorously reined in and suppressed the defile­ ments, but because it has arisen when the defilements are cut off." 1929 Vimuttatta thito, thitatta sdntusito, santusitatta no paritassati. This sequence is also at SN III 45,13-14, 46,4-5, 54,1-2, 55,34-35, 58,23-24. It is on the basis of the latter passages that I see a change in the subject of the last phrase of the AN text, from "it," refer­

 thus may be interpreted as referring either to the samadhi or to the person, the SN parallels read: Vimuttatta thitam. Thitatta santusitam. Santusitatta na paritassati. Aparitassam paccattanneva parinibbayati. 'Khina jftti, vusitam brahmacariyam, katam karamyam, naparam itthattayd'ti pajanati ti. The neuter singular participles indicate that the subject of the first two phrases is cittam, but with santusitatta na paritassati, the subject seems to shift from cittam to the person attaining liberation. We can infer by analogy that in the present passage a similar shift occurs, in this case from samadhi to the person who attains it. 1930 Ayam, bhante Ananda, samadhi kimphalo vutto bhagavata. The ques- tionis ambiguous. It could mean either, "Of what did the Blessed' One say this concentration is the fruit?" or "What did the Blessed One say this concentration has as its fruit?" Mp takes it in the former way, but there are arguments in favor of the latter (see next note). 1931 Ayam, bhagini, samadhi anndphalovutto-bhagavata. The compound annaphalocould be interpreted either as a tappurisa ("this concen­ tration is the fruit of final knowledge") or as a bahubbthi ("this concentration has final knowledge as its fruit"). In the former case, the samadhi is to be identified with the fruit; in the latter, with an achievement preceding the fruit. Mp takes it in the former sense, as the fruit itself: "The nun asks about the concentration of the fruit of arahantship (arahattaphalasamfidhi), Final knowledge is arahantship. The Blessed One has spoken of this concentra­ tion of the fruit of arahantship. [The intention is:} When one is percipient with the perception of the fruit of arahantship, one does not experience that base." However, the question kimphald occurs repeatedly at SN V 118,22—120,19, where it must mean, "What does it have as its fruit?" And in 5:25 we find pancahi, bhikkhave, angehianuggahita sammaditthi ca cetovimuttrphalahoti... pahnavimuttiphald ca hoti. The sense here is not that right view is the fruit of liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, but that right view has liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom as its fruit. Further, in 3:101, a samadhi described in exactly the same terms as this one is shown to be the supporting condition for the six higher knowledges, the last of which is the "the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom." By analogy, it follows that this samadhi is not the fruit of final knowledge, but one that yields final knowledge. There is a Chinese parallel to this last portion of the sutta, SA 557 at T II 146ai2-29. In this version, when the bhikkhuni asks Ananda the question about the concentration of mind without

 reward of wisdom" (la ^  which has the same ambiguity that I mentioned in the preceding note). 1932 Lokuyatika brahmana. See SN 12:48, II 77. Normally, the lokayatika are depicted as materialists; here, however, they seem to be sim­ ply speculators about the world. 1933 My translation does not follow any of the three editions available to me, which are all problematic. In Be both teachers claim to know an infinite world with infinite knowledge. Purana Kassapa says: aham. anantena nanena anantam lokam janam passam viharami, And Nataputta [the Jain teacher Mahavlra] uses exactly the same words. Since this directly contradicts the statement (in.all edi­ tions) that the two make mutually opposed claims (ubhinnam annamannam vipaccamkavadanam), Be must be faulty here: The error is likely to be1 old, for several Burmese manuscripts and a Siamese manuscript (referred to in Ee's notes) also have this reading. In Ce and Ee Purana Kassapa says: aham anantena nanena antavantam lokam janam passam viharami, and Nataputta says: aham antavantena nanena antavantam lokam janam passam viharami.. This reading, too, seems faulty. First, it has Nataputta claim finite knowledge, when it is known that he claimed omniscience or infinite knowledge. Second, though it makes the two teachers claim different ranges of knowledge; their conclusions about the world are the same. A true contradiction would emerge only if one teacher asserts that the world is infinite and the other that it is finite, I take it that they both claim infinite knowledge (anantena nanena) but differ regarding the extent of the world. Since the Jains actually posit the world to be both,finite and infinite (see just below), I assume the brahmin understands Nataputta to hold the world to be finite, and thus takes his opponent Purana Kas­ sapa to posit the world to be infinite. We have no other sources on Purana's thought with which to understand his cosmology. Elsewhere the crux of Purana's philosophy .is said to be the doc­ trine of non-doing (DN 2.17,152,21—53,4) or the thesis that beings are defiled and purified without cause, or that there is no cause for knowledge and vision (SN 46:56, V 126,26-30). At 6:57 a system of six classes of people is ascribed to him. Mahavlra's view of the world is explained in "Various top­ ics prepared on Jain History by Dr. K. C. Jain and his team" (http: / / www. ja inworld .com / literature / j ainhiato r y / chap ter4. asp): "It is with regard to these questions [about the world] that Mahavira declared: 'From these alternatives, you cannot arrive

 ever-changing state is concerned/ In regard to such questions, Mahavlra's advice to his disciples was neither to support those who maintained that the world is eternal nor those who advo­ cated that it is not eternal. He would have said the same thing regarding such propositions as the world exists and it does not exist; the world is unchangeable; the world is in constant flux; the world has a beginning; the world has no beginning; the world has an end; the world has no end; etc." (my italics). 1934 Be lacks paramaya gatiya, found in Ce and Ee. 1935 Dalhadhamma dhanuggaho sikkhito katahattho katupasano. Mp's comments on these terms differs slightly from its comments at 4:45 (see p. 1690, notes 724 and 725). Here Mp says: "Firm-bowed archer (dalhadhamma dhanuggaho): an archer who has taken up a firm bow. A 'firm bow' (dalhadhanu) is called the 'strength of two thousand' (dvisahassathamam): a bow to which one can attach an arrow with a head made of some metal such as bronze or lead, etc., fit the arrow notch to the string, grasp the bow handle and draw back the string the full length of the arrow shaft, and shoot the arrow up from the ground. Trained (sikkhito): they have studied the craft in their teacher's clan for ten or twelve years. Skillful (katahattho): one who has simply studied a craft is not yet skillful; they are skillful when they have achieved mastery over it. Experienced (katupasano): one who has exhibited his craft in the king's court, etc." 1936 As at 4:45 (and SN 2:26,161—62). 1937 Text has evarupaya sandhavanikaya here, whereas 4:45 has gamanena. Mp glosses padasa dhavanena, "running on foot." 1938 Ce and Ee add here bhlta, "frightened/' but it seems this word belongs only in the third case, when the devas flee to their city. In Be it occurs only in relation to the third case. 1939 All three editions read here antamakasi maram. Presumably their editors took this to mean, "who has made an end to Mara." But this is certainly wrong, for two reasons: first, grammatically, this would require the genitive marassa; and second, it is not true that a meditator in jhana has "made an end to Mara." Elsewhere we find andhamakasi maram (at MN I 159,19, I 160,5,10,1 174,15-16, and I 175,5), "he made Mara blind" or "blinded Mara," which makes better sense. Ps II 163,-ms, commenting on MN I 159,19, explains: "He blinded Mara: he did not destroy Mara's eyes, but when a bhikkhu has attained jhana as a basis for insight, Mara is unable to see the object of his mind. Hence it is said: 'He blinded Mara'" (andhamakasi maran ti na marassa akkhini bhindi.

 1940 Apadam vadhitva mdracakkhum. Mp: "Put out M ara's eyes zvith- out a trace: destroyed [them] completely, without remainder (nippadam niravasesam vadhitva).'' At MN 1 159,19-160,12 and MN 1 174,15—175,6 this whole statement is made about all nine medita­ tive attainments, including the four jhanas. There thus seems to be a difference between the textual lineages about the extent to which this statement applies. 1941 Hatthikalabha. Mp glosses as "very big bull elephants" (mahantd mahanta naga). This, however, begs the question how these bull elephants differ from the main subject of the simile. Ud 41 ,20-21 mentions different types of elephants, among them hatthikalabha (Ee hatthikalara) which Ud^a 250,12-13 calls ele­ phant offspring (hatthipotakd). They are there distinguished from hatthicchapd, young elephant offspring still being nursed (khirupagd daharahatthipotaka). I translate in accordance with this explanation.
 •1942 With Be and Ee, I read mallesu, as against Ce malatesu. SN 42:11 is also set at Uruvelakappa, which is said to be a town of the Mallas (see CDB 1348). 1943 Mp glosses vimuccati here as "liberated from the opposing quali­ ties" (paccanlkadhammehi ca vimuccati). Since all three editions, with the support of Mp, have vimuccati, I translate in conformity with this reading, but I think it likely that the original reading was adhimuccati, "resolved upon" or "focused on/' As the text unfolds with respect to the successive meditative attainments, in each case the bodhisatta is vimuccati/adhimuccati upon the attainment before he actually achieves it. In such a context being "focused on" rather than "liberated in" makes better sense. 1944 Ce has the genitive plural passatam, while Be and Ee have the genitive singular passato. Mp (Be) has passato in the lemma and a genitive plural in the gloss: ' Etam santan ti passato ti etam nekkhammam santam vigatadarathaparildhan ti evam passantdnam bhikkhunam. Passato is also found in an older Sinhala edition. Possibly passato entered the text through an erroneous transpo­ sition from the Buddha's account below, where the singular is appropriate. 1945 Mp interprets renunciation (nekkhamma) here as "going forth" (pabbajja) into homelessness. But the text itself seems to allow renunciation as an internal quality, implicitly identified with firm attainment of the first jhana. 1946 I follow the section divisions of Ee, which conform to the para­ graph divisions in Be and show the transitions in the discourse better than the divisions in Ce.

 the corresponding sections to come. Ce and Be omit it in later sections. 1948 Here I follow the manuscripts referred to in the note to Ee, which read upekhdsukhasahagata ("accompanied by the pleasure [con­ nected with] equanimity"). This fits the exposition better than the reading upe(k)khdsahagatd found in all three printed editions. 1949 In Ce and Be Sdmannavaggo. Ee names this Pancdlavagga. 1950 The verse occurs at SN 2 :7 ,148. Be and Ee have a faulty reading of pada a in AN, sambadhe gatarn okasam, as against Ce sambadhe vata okasam. The Be and Ee text of SN 2:7 reads vata. Also, in pada . b, Ce has avindi, Eeavida, two aorist forms meaning "knew." But Be has avidva, "unknowing, ignorant/' which is hard to account for. In SN 2:7 Be also reads the verb as avindi. 1951 See 9:37. 1952 Pariydyena. Mp: "For a single reason (ekena kdranena). For the first jhana is called the achievement of an opening with respect merely to the absence of confinement by sensuality, not in every respect."
 ■1953 Yadeva tattha rupasanna aniruddha hoti. The singular verb hoti indi­ cates that "perception" in the singular is intended here. In the immediately following paragraph, however, rupasahnanam and patighasanndnam are genitive plurals. 1954 Nippariydyena. Mp: "Not just for a single reason, but because it abandons all confinement, the destruction of the taints is called the achievement of an opening in every way." 1955 MN 70.17, I 478,4^-8 offers a formal definition of the body wit­ ness (kdyasakkhl) as a person who "contacts with the body and abides in those emancipations that are peaceful and formless, transcending forms, and some of his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom." In the present sutta, however, the term "body witness" does not conform to this formal definition but is explained on the basis of a word play. Strictly speaking, the one who attains the complete destruction of the taints is no longer a body witness, a category restricted to those still in training. 1956 Yatha yathdca tadayatanam tathd tathd nam kayena phusitva viharati. Mp: "Through whatever means or in whatever way there is that base consisting in the first jhana, by that same means, or in that same way, he dwells having contacted that attainment with the coexistent mental body (sahajdtanamakdyena phusitva)." 1957 As suggested by the previous note, here the term "non- provisional sense" is itself being used in a loose, "provisional" sense. In the strict, non-provisional sense, such a disciple is not a body witness, for the real body witness has still not reached

 1958 Again, strictly speaking, according to the formal definition at MN 70.16,1477 ,33-36, the one liberated by wisdom (pannavimutta) is an arahant who does not attain the formless emancipations or the cessation of perception and feeling. Similarly, to meet the formal requirement of "liberated in both respects" (in the follow­ ing sutta), a disciple must not only realize arahantship but must also attain the formless emancipations, as stated at MN 70.15, I 477,25-28. • 1959 Sikkhadubbalyani. Lit., "weaknesses in [regard to] to the train­ ing." What is intended are not defects in the training itself, but defects in one's observance of the training. Suttas 9:63-92 are all composite nines combining ten different fivefold sets with, suc­ cessively, the four establishments of mindfulness, the four right strivings, and the four bases for psychic potency. 1960 Ee does not number this vagga. Ce numbers it 5 and Be numbers it. (10). 5, using both the consecutive numbering scheme and the number of the vagga in the set of fifty.. 1961 Ce does riot number the suttas in the series. Be numbers them in continuity with those in the entire nipata, from 93 to 432. Ee numbers them from 93 to 100, with no explanation why it ends at 100.1 follow the numbering of Be. 1962 Ce has 3-18, but there are eighteen suttas in this group; the nine perceptions and nine meditative attainments are to be taken col­ lectively with each of the nine terms from "full understanding" to "relinquishment." The eighteen beginning with 3 should thus be added to the two previous suttas so that the present group ends at 20. 1963 Ce has a note: "The seventeen terms, from Tust' through 'heed­ lessness/ are each to be joined with the ten terms beginning with 'for direct knowledge/ These are each to be taken separately with the nine perceptions and the nine meditative attainments, described as/nine things to be developed/ Thus there are alto­ gether 340 suttas."

 1964 Iti kho, Ananda, kusalani silani anupubbena aggaya parenti. Mp glosses aggaya with arahattatthaya. 1965 Dhammata esa. Mp: "This is the nature of things, the order of causation" (dhammasabhavo eso karananiyamo ayam). The point, of course, is not that one need make no volitional effort at all, but that establishing each prior factor serves as a natural supporting condition for each subsequent factor. Thus the effort needed to

 arouse the later factor is much less than would be required if the proper supporting condition had not been established. 1966 Iti kho, bhikkhave, dhamma dhamme abhisandenti, dhamma dhamme paripurenti apara param gamanaya. Mp: "For going from the near shore to the far shore: For going from 'the near shore/ the round of existence with its three planes, to 'the far shore/ nibbana"

**(iorimatirabhutd tebhumakavatta nibbanapdram gamanatthaya). It**
###### seems that the point in expressing this in terms of dhamma, which I here render "stages," is to show that this process of develop­ ment unfolds in accordance with natural principles as one stage conditions the arising of the subsequent stage all the way from the beginning of the path to its culmination. This series thus con­ stitutes a "positive" version of dependent origination. We meet this positive version in the Upanisa Sutta (SN 12:23, II 29—32). See my essay on this sutta, Bodhi 1980. 1967 An expanded parallel of 5:24, 6:50, 7:65, and 8:81. 1968 Mp: "He would not take earth as object and be percipient through an arisen perception 'earth.'" It seems that what is being denied here is a jhana based on the earth kasina. The same holds below for water, fire, and air. This is confirmed by the next four steps, which negate the foUr formless bases. In other words, this concentration is not a jhana based bn the kasinas or formless attainments. 1969 Mp identifies this with the concentration of fruition attainment (phalasamapattisamadhi). This attainment is not the fruition that occurs for a few moments immediately following the path, but a special meditative state accessible only to those who have already attained one of the four paths and its subsequent frui­ tion. The attainment, as shown in this sutta, does not take any of the mundane, conditioned meditation objects as its support; its support is the unconditioned nibbana, experienced directly and immediately. The commentaries hold that this attainment is graded as fourfold according to the four stages of realization (from stream-entry to arahantship). 1970 Bhavanirodho nibbanam bhavanirodham nibbanam. Mp para­ phrases thus: "'On that occasion, friend, I was percipient with the perception of fruition attainment/ Reviewing knowledge (paccavekkhand) is discussed to show that this attainment was accompanied by mind." In other words, because perception was present, this was not "the cessation of perception and feeling" (sannavedayitanirodha). 1971 An expanded parallel based on 8:71. See too the part-parallel ' 9:4.

###### 1973 This is a composite ten. The first set of five is in 5:53. 1974 Still another composite ten. 1975 A composite sutta with part-parallels at 5:205-6 and 9:71—72. 1976 Perhaps, with Be, we should read susamucchinnct here, but I fol­ low Ce and Ee, which have simply samucchinna here, though susamucchinna below. 1977 As at 4:34. The series of similes occurs at SN 45:139^47, V 41-45, with the simile of cloth in the tenth place. 1978 An expanded parallel of 9:10. 1979 Nathakarana dhamma. Mp: "They act as protectors for oneself, meaning that they act as supports" (attano sanathabhavakara patitthakarati attho).. 1980 Mp on piyasamudaharO: "He listens carefully when another is teaching, and he himself desires to teach others." I understand abhidhamme and abhivinuye simply in the referential sense, as explained in note 1086. Mp, however, distinguishes between dhamma as the Sutta Pitaka and abhidhamma■ as the seven trea­ tises (of the Abhidhamma Pitaka);. and vinaya as the twofold Suttavibhahga and abhivinaya as the Khandhakas and Pari vara. This type of explanation presupposes the existence of texts that had probably been compiled several generations after the Bud­ dha's passing. 1981 The text uses the past, present, and future forms of the verb avasati, "abide." Since a literal translation would be clumsy, I have rendered the phrase in accordance with the sense. 1982 As at 6:1. 1983 From this point on the text is an expanded parallel of 6:64. See the latter for notes on the first, second, and seventh powers here. The ten Tathagata powers are also in MN 12.9-20,1 69-71 and are analyzed in detail at Vibh 336-44 (Be §§809-31). 1984 Sabbatthdgdminim patipadam yathabhutam nanam. Vibh 339. (Be §811) identifies this with the Buddha's knowledge of the paths leading to hell, the animal realm, the spirit world, the human world, the deva world, and nibbana. See MN 12.37-43,1 74—77. 1985 Anekadhatunanadhatulokam yathabhutam nanam. Vibh 339 (Be §812) defines this as the Buddha's'knowledge of the diversity in the aggregates, sense bases, and elements. 1986 Sattanam nftnadhimuttikatam yathabhutam nanam. Vibh 339 (§813) explains this as the Buddha's knowledge of beings as having inferior or superior dispositions, and his understanding of how those with similar dispositions come together and meet. 1987 Parasattanam parapuggalanam indriyaparopariyattam yathabhutam nanam. Vibh 340—42 (§§814—27) explains this as the 13ud~ dha's knowledge of the condition of sentient beings' diverse

###### inclinations, underlying tendencies, temperaments, dispositions, intelligence, faculties, characters, receptivity, and potentiality. The terms are all explicated in detail. Mp is more concise, defin­ ing it simply as the Buddha's knowledge of whether the five faculties of beings (their faith, etc.) are increasing or declining. 1988 Mp: " The things {ye te dhamma): the knowledge of the ten powers,
 [or] the things pertaining to the knowledge of omniscience. Doc­ trinal principles (adhivuttipadanam): principles of designation; this . means such things as the aggregates, sense bases, and elements, which are the grounds for the principles of the teaching/' 1989 Etadanuttariyam, A nanda, nananam yadidam tattha tattha yatha- bhutananam. Mp: "The knowledge of various phenomena accord­ ing to their essential nature; by this he shows the knowledge of omniscience" (tesu tesu dhammesu yathdsabhavananam; imina , sabbanhutannanam dasseti). 1990 Ce and Ee read pannaya disva disva.- Be does not repeat disva, but Mp (Be) seems to support the reading of Ce and Ee wijth its gloss: sahavipassanaya maggapannaya.passitva passitva. pahatabba ' ("To be abandoned after having repeatedly seen with path wis­ dom together with insight wisdom"). ■ 1991 Papika issa. It is hard to account for the adjective papika, since there are no instances in the texts of a benign type of envy. 1992 Abhibhuyya iriyati, glossed by Mp with vattati. 1993 Mp says that the claims to knowledge, to development, and to both knowledge and development, in the three sections, are all claims to airahantship. 1994 Abhibhuyya titthati. This does not seem to differ in meaning from abhibhuyya iriyati used in the preceding sutta. 1995 Kasinayatanani. The kasinas are disks representing elements or col­ ors used as objects of samadhi. meditation. For example, the earth kasina is a disk filled with reddish brown clay; the water kasina is a bowl of water; the color kasinas are colored disks. Though the meditator begins with a physical disk, when he can see the kasina clearly with his mind's eye, he discards the physical disk and focuses solely on the mental image. As concentration deepens, another image called the "counterpart mark" (patibhaganimitta) emerges as an anchor of attention. Vism chaps. 4 and 5 offer a detailed explanation of the kasinas. In the Vism system, the space kasina (which was originally the base of the infinity of space) is replaced by the limited-space kasina, and the consciousness kasina by the light kasina. 1996 "Nonduai" (advaya) here refers simply to the presentation of the object and not to an underlying ontological unity. Mp explains:


-----

###### of another. For just as, when one enters the water, there is only water and nothing else in all directions, so too, the earth kasina is only the earth kasina. It is unmixed with any other kasina. The same method applies to the others." On appamana, "m easure­ less," Mp says: "This is stated by way of measureless pervasion of this or that [object]. For pervading it with the mind, one per­ vades the whole thing; one does not grasp boundaries, thinking: 'This is its beginning, this is its middle.'" 1997 At 1:267 Kali is called the "foremost of those whose confidence is based on hearsay." Apparently she never met the Buddha but based her trust in him on what she heard from others. 1998 SN 4:25, 1 126,15-18. The "maidens" are M ara's daughters, who try to tempt the Buddha after his enlightenment. The question here is specifically that of the daughter Tanha, "Craving." 1999 Ce and Ee: atthabhinibbattesum. Be: attho ti abhinibbattesum. Mp: "They generated it, thinking the attainment of the earth kasina is supreme, taking it as the ultimate goal." 2000 Ce and Ee adimaddasa; Be assadamaddasa. The Ce and Ee reading here is unusual. The standard triad is gratification, danger, and escape (assada, adlnava, nissarana), which we find here in Be. The Chinese parallel SA 549 (T II 143a2-bi7) provides a check on the two alternatives. Though SA 549 differs in some respects, the list of insights regarding the kasinas reads: "[He] saw its origin, saw the danger, saw cessation, saw the path to cessation" (MJt-'fr • M It • MM ■ A'Mi 'jBM'). The Chinese character ^ corresponds to Pali adi, not to assada, thus supporting Ce and Ee against Be, which may have normalized the reading. The Ce and Be readings of Mp differ with respect to the same word. 2001 Sabbam dhammam. I understand the singular to be doing service for the plural sabbe dhamme. 2002 Ce and Ee sabbam dhammam abhinMya abhinnaya. Be lacks the repetition. 2003 Despite the grammatical form of the sentences, I believe that this rendering does better justice to the sense than a literal transla­ tion, "One question, one concise statement, one explanation." The "tw os" and higher numbers do not present "two questions, etc.," "three questions, etc.," and so forth, but a question about two items, a question about three items, and so forth. 2004 The Chinese parallel at EA 46.8 (T II 778bi7) provides some interesting points of contrast. The Pali version is more cogent with respect to certain items, particularly the fours, fives, sixes, and tens; here EA 46.8 has the four noble truths, the five spiri­ tual faculties, the six principles of communal harmony, and the ten kinds of mindfulness (the six recollections, mindfulness of


-----

###### the body, of death, of breathing, and of peace). EA 46.8 pro­ vides explanations of the items in each group, which calls our attention to what is missing in the Pali version. While the Pali version announces three categories for each number— the ques­ tion (panha), the concise statement (uddesa), and the explanation (veyyakarana)— the sutta presents only two, the question and the concise statement, but not the explanation. The Kumarapanha section of the Khuddakapatha (§4) partly overlaps this list, but since the latter simply lists items to be remembered, without reference to disenchantment and dispassion, it includes positive sets: the four noble truths, the seven enlightenment factors, the eightfold path, and the ten factors of an arahant. 2005 Sabbe satta aharatthitika. 2006 Pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and feeling that is neither pain­ ful nor pleasant. 2007 Edible food, contact, mental volition, and consciousness. These ' are called nutriment (ahara) in the sense that they sustain the continuity of existence. 2008 See 7:44. 2009 See 8:6. 2010 See 9:24. 2011 I follow Be and Ee dasasu akusalesu kammapathesu, as against Ce dasasu akusalesu dhammesu. Ce has dasasu kusalesu kammapathesu at 10:28 §10. 2012 Kajangalika bhikkhuni. It is hard to determine whether this is a proper name or a designation by way of her place of origin. If, however, it were a proper name the text would probably have read Kajangalika nama bhikkhuni. 2013 When she speaks about the four establishments of mindfulness— and below about the five faculties, the six elements of escape, the noble eightfold path, and the ten wholesome deeds— the formu­ lation changes. Instead of saying, "is completely disenchanted w ith... completely dispassionate toward them, completely liber­ ated from them" (samma nibbindamano samma virajjamano samma vimuccamano), she says: "has a mind completely well developed in" (samma subhavitacitto). 2014 The Pali editions abridge the text thus. 2015 See 6:13. 2016 This cosmology is also at 3:80. 2017 Yebhuyyena satta abhassarasamvattanika bhavanti. This seems to mean that they are reborn among the dbhassara devas, the high­ est plane corresponding to the second jhana. It remains while all the lower planes of existence undergo dissolution. 2018 As above at 10:25.


-----

###### 2019 As at 8:65. 2020 As at 4:161-62. 2021 Mp does not comment, but I assume these four perceptions are sense-sphere perception, perception in the four jhanas, percep­ tion in the first two formless attainments, and perception in the base of nothingness. 2022 See pp. 1780-82, note 1532. 2023 Ya cayam bhave appatikulyata, sa c’assa na bhavissati, ya cayam bha- vanirodhe patikulyata, sa c’assa na bhavissati. The point, it seems, is that because annihilationism arises from aversion toward continued personal existence, the annihilationist welcomes the cessation of existence, though from the Buddha's perspective annihilationism goes too far by misinterpreting such cessation as the annihilation of a real self or existent person. See It §49, 43-44. 2024 Paramatthavisuddhim pannapenti. Mp: "This is a designation for the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. For the base of nothingness is highest as the foundation for insight, but the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception is highest in terms of long lifespan." 2025 Paramaditthadhammam nibbanam pannapenti. See DN 1.3.19-25, 136-38, where five views of "supreme nibbana in this very life" are examined. These hold that supreme nibbana is the unre­ strained enjoyment of the five kinds of sensual pleasure or each of the four jhanas (taken individually). The Buddha opposes these here with the assertion that supreme nibbana is attained by fully understanding the six sense bases for contact. The same is said at DN 1.3.71,1 45,17- 20. 2026 Mp glosses "full understanding" (parinna) here with overcoming (samatikkama). The full understanding (or overcoming) of sen­ sual pleasures occurs by the first jhana; the full understanding of form, by the formless meditative attainments; and the full understanding of feelings, by the attainment of nibbana, where all feeling has been stilled. 2027 Mp explains the historical background: When King Kosala the Great (Pasenadi's father) presented his daughter in marriage to Bimbisara (the king of Magadha), he gave her the village of Kasi (between the two kingdoms) as a wedding gift. Years later, after Ajatasattu killed his father Bimbisara, his mother died of grief. Pasenadi decided: "Since Ajatasattu killed his parents, the vil­ lage belongs to my father." Ajatasattu, too, thought: "It belongs to my mother." The two, uncle and nephew, fought a war over Kasi. Pasenadi was twice defeated by Ajatasattu and had to flee the battle, but on the third occasion he captured Ajatasattu. This


-----

###### was the purpose of which it is said "his purpose having been achieved" (laddhadhippayo). 2028 At MN II 120,m King Pasenadi makes a similar demonstration of reverence for the Buddha and gives ten reasons for showing the Buddha such supreme honor and love. However, the individual items there differ from these. 2029 Bahuno janassa ariye naye patitthapits yadidam kalyanadhammataya kusaladhammataya. Mp glosses "in the noble method" as "in the path along with insight" (sahavipassamke magge). I follow PED in taking patitthapita to be an agent noun in the nominative singular. 2030 Though sikkhUpadamis singular, I understand the statement here to refer to the whole corpus of training rules and I thus translate in the plural. In the Vinaya Pitaka, this statement occurs in con­ nection with the laying down of the first parajika and the singular is therefore appropriate; see Vin III 2 1 ,15-23. 2031 Ee mistakenly joins this sutta to the previous one, thus reducing the count by one. At Vin II240-47 "suspending the Patimokkha" (patimokkhatthapana) refers to canceling an individual's right to participate in the Patimokkha recitation on the uposatha. It seems to me that in the present sutta "suspending the Patimokkha" includes both canceling the Patimokkha recitation for a particu­ lar monk and delaying the recitation of the Patimokkha until an obstructive condition has been removed. See Thanissaro 2007b: 270-71, for a discussion of the former set of conditions under which the Patimokkha recitation is canceled. 2032 Parajikakatha vippakata hoti. Mp: "Such talk as this, 'Did such a person commit a parajika or not?' has been started and has not been concluded ('asukapuggalo parajikam apanno nu kho no’ ti evam katha arabhitva anitthapita hoti)." Note that this passage supports the translation of the stock question that the Buddha asks the monks when they are in conversation— ka ca pana vo antarakatha vippakata?— as: "W hat was your conversation that was underway?" The common alternatives— "W hat was your conver­ sation that was interrupted?" and "W hat was your conversation that has been concluded?"— do not work in this context, and in any case are contradicted by the commentaries, which consistently gloss vippakata as meaning "not brought to a conclusion, not com­ pleted" (aparinitthita sikham appatta at Sv 1 4 9 ,27-28, Ps II 169,15-16; pariyantam na gata at Ps III 226,1- 4; apariyosita at Ud-a 1 0 4 ,26-30). 2033 The word pandaka has a wider meaning than "eunuch" as usu­ ally understood. Sp V 1016,1 9 describes five types of pandakas. Of these, the two most relevant here are the castrated male (opakkamikapandaka) and the person bom sexually indeterminate


-----

###### (napumsakapandaka). A parallel of this distinction can be found in Matthew 19:12 (English Standard Version): "For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven." The first correspond to the napumsakas', the second to the opakkamikas, and the third perhaps to those who choose celibacy (or castrate themselves) for religious reasons. 2034 The implications of bhikkhunidusaka are not spelled out in the canonical texts themselves. However, the Viniayavinicchaya-tTka I 121 (VRI ed.; Be §322) defines the term in a way that applies to a bhikkhu who has had sexual intercourse of any kind with a bhikkhuni: "One is said to be a bhikkhunidusaka when one has defiled a bhikkhuni in good standing by having sexual relations with .her" (dusako ti pakatattaya bhikkhuniya methunam patisevitva tassa dusitatta bhikkhunim dusetiti "bhikkhunidusako"ti vutto ca). Thus the term does not necessarily imply rape and "seducer of abhikkhunl" should be a fit rendering. 2035 Ubbahikd. DOP defines as "the reference (of a dispute) to a com­ mittee of selected bhikkhus." Mp: "Adjudication means picking out, selecting from the Sangha to settle a disciplinary issue that has arisen" (sarnpatta-adhikaranam vupasametum sahghato ubbahitva uddharitva gahanatthaya). The procedure is described in detail at Vin II 95,25-97,16. 2036 Mp: "The four kinds of disciplinary issues." The four are a dis­ pute, an accusation, an offense, and proceedings. {vivadadhikaranay anuvadadhikarana, apattadhikarana, kiccadhikarana). See MN 104.12-20,11247-50. 2037 Mp defines this as the seven ways of settling disciplinary issues (satta adhikaranasamatha). 2038 Ee merges this sutta with the preceding one, so that from this point on my numbering exceeds He's by two. 2039 Ee treats this as the end of the sutta and the next sentence as the beginning of a separate sutta, which it numbers 38. Thus Ee's numbering of the suttas catches up on one of the two suttas by which it fell behind earlier. 2040 Kappatthiyam kibbisam pasavati. Mp glosses, kibbisam with papam and says that the question concerns the cause for dwelling in hell for ayukappa, the "life eon." Such an account of the word kappa is not found in the Nikayas and seems to be a commentarial innovation. See p. 1811, note 1786. 2041 As above, Ee treats this as the end of the sutta and the next sen­ tence as the beginning of a separate sutta, which it numbers 40. Thus Ee's numbering how matches that of the other editions.


-----

###### 2042 I add the word "mutual" on the basis of Mp's gloss: annam - annassa sangahanuggaho. 2043 For explanations of these terms, see p. 1602, note 66. 2044 This sutta combines two fivefold sets and can thus be considered a composite ten. 2045 Ce guyhavanta should be corrected to guyhamanta, as in Be and Ee. Here guyhamanta almost certainly means "secret deliberations," not "secret mantras." 2046 Mp glosses pattheti with maretum icchati, "wishes to kill." I do not see how a desire to kill can be derived from the Pali and thus prefer to take pattheti in its usual sense, as simply, "to wish, to long for." My guess as to its relevance here is that a man who has fathered a son through one of the concubines, wants to see his son, and a concubine's son who learns that he was sired, by a man other than the king wants to meet his real father, and the king suspects the monk of being the go-between. 2047 Ce and Be read hatthisammaddam; Ee has hatthisammadani in the text, but —sammaddam and —sambadham -as.alternative readings. . Mp (Be) reads hatthisambadham, resolved as hatthlki. sambadham ("crowded with elephants"). Mp (Ce) allows this reading too, though its text seems corrupted. Both editions of Mp recognize the alternative hatthisammaddam. 2048 The eight factors are the eight uposatha precepts, on which see 8:41. 2049 Ce and Ee stop at fifty kahapanas, but Be adds a hundred kahapanas. The kahapaiia was the major currency unit of the time. 2050 Lit., "a hundred times a hundred years" (satarhpi vdssasatani). 2051 Lit., "a hundred times a hundred thousand years" (satampi vassasatasaliassani). 2052 Because of the ambivalence of the word kamma (meaning both "a deed" and "the potential for results created by a deed"), the question and the reply might also have been formulated in terms of "a bad deed." The same holds below in regard to good kamma. 2053 Vevanniy'amhi ajjhupagato. The four main classes of Indian society in the Buddha's time were referred to as vanna, lit., "color," and thus the privative form, vivanna, should mean "without class" or "classless." Vevanniya is the abstract noun, "ciasslessness," implying that those who go forth give up their prior status as brahmin, khattiya, vessa, sudda, or outcast, and become known simply as ascetics following the Sakyan son (see 8:19 §4). By the time of the commentaries the original meaning seems to have been forgotten, and thus Mp takes the word in the sense of "plain"

###### 1844 The Anguttara Nikaya

 body and with respect to articles of use. Vevanniya with respect to body means shaving off the hair and beard. Vevanniya with respect to articles of use means wearing ochre robes made from stitched-together pieces of cloth; eating food mixed together with water in an iron or clay bowl; sleeping at the foot of a tree, etc., and lying down on mats made of reeds and grass, etc.; sitting on a strip of leather or cloth, etc.; and using fermented cow's urine, etc., for medicine. When one reflects thus, anger and conceit are abandoned." 2054 Parapatibaddha me jlvika. Monastics do not work at salaried jobs to earn money with which to purchase their requisites but receive all their material supports—robes, almsfood, lodgings, and med­ icines— as offerings from the lay community. One does not make use of the four requisites without having reflected upon them. 2055 A nno me akappo karanlyo. Mp: "Laypeople walk by swelling up their chest, lifting their heads high, in a playful manner, with dis­ orderly steps. But my manner must be different. I must walk with calm sense faculties, with a calm mind, with slow and measured steps, like a cart passing through water or a rough place. ” 2056 Here and in the next reflection the intended sense is conveyed more clearly in English if na is not translated. 2057 This and the following reflection are in 5:57. 2058 Ponobhaviko bhavasahkha.ro. Mp: "The kamma that creates existence, the active production of renewed existence" (ponobbhaviko ti punabbhavanibbattako, bhavasankharo ti bhavasankharanakammam). Presumably this is said to subsist through the body because the body is the instrument for forming and expressing volition. 2059 The formula is the same as that at 6:12, though the content is different. The ten principles are the same as the "ten qualities that make for a protector" at 10:18. 2060 Ce paripunnam should be corrected to parisuddham as in Be and Ee. Ce reads parisuddham in the parallel passage occurring in the later suttas of the chapter, so it is clear that paripunnam is a typogi'aphical error. 2061 A Chinese parallel, MA 110 <|T I 598c2i—599b7), differs slightly from the Pali in its list of defilements and their wholesome oppo­ sites. It includes lack of faith and faith, muddle-mindedness and mindfulness, and foolishness and wisdom. Faith, mindfulness, and wisdom— together with energy and concentration (overlap­ ping with the Pali list)—constitute the five spiritual faculties, considered as absent or present. 2062 I use "decline" to render parihani and "deterioration" to render hani. The two. are virtuall)' synonymous.

###### Notes to the Tens 1845

 2064 This portion of the sutta is modeled upon 9:6, but it takes associ­ ating with a person last and does not treat it in as much detail. 2065 A similar passage is at 6:51. In the present sutta, Be and Ee read the second item as sammosam gacchanti, lit. "go to forgetting," which seems preferable to Ce sammoham gacchanti, "go to delu­ sion." In 6:51 all three editions read na sammosam gacchanti, which is supported by Mp's gloss: vinasam na gacchanti ("they are not lost"). Here and below, where Ce and Ee read pubbe cetaso sanjphutthapubba, Be has the negative pubbe cetaso asamphuttha- pubbar "with which he had previously not been familiar." This is likely to be a .typographical error; at 6:51 Be reads,in.conformity with Ce and Ee, pubbe cetaso samphutthapubba. 2066 An expanded parallel of 5:61, 7:48, and 9:16. 2067 The last five contemplations are among the ten foulness medita­ tion subjects dealt with in detail in Vism chap. 6. 2068 An expanded parallel, based on 8:83. It also has a close corre­ spondence with 9:14, which poses nine of the questions, but in terms of "intentions and thoughts'" (sahkappavitakka) rather than "all things" (sabbe dhamma). 2069 The last two items, amatogadha sabbe dhamma. and nibbanapariyosana sabbe dhamma, seem to be synonymous. A Chinese parallel, MA . 113 (at T I 602ci-i6), makes the following assertions: "All things are rooted in desire; all come together in contact; all converge on feeling; all originate from attention; all are stopped by mindful­ ness (see Sn 1035); all are headed by concentration; wisdom is above all; liberation is the truth (or core) of all; all have nibbana
 • as their consummation." Interestingly, MA 113 continues (at T I 602ci7-28) with a passage that in AN correponds to the next sutta, 10:59, though rather than assure the monk who practices in such, a way one of two fruits, it states that he will definitely attain arahantship. 2070 Na c'uppanna papaka akusala dhamma ciitam pariyddaya thassanti. As phrased, the text seems to be saying that such bad unwhole' some qualities do arise but do not gain control over the bhikkhu's mind. However, it is possible the intent of the statement is that such bad unwholesome qualities do not arise and gain control over his mind. 2071 Lokassa samahca visamahca. Mp: "Good conduct and misconduct in the world of beings" (sattalokassa sucaritaduccaritani). 2072 Lokassa bhavanca vibhavanca. Mp glosses as "its growth and destruction, also success and failure." 2073 Perceptions §§8-10 will be explained just below in 10:60. 2074 Apart from this text there is no further information about

 this sutta has achieved the status of a paritta, a "protective dis­ course/' which bhikkhus often recite to people afflicted with illness. 2075 In Be only, ottharogo, lip disease, is between dantarogo and kaso. 2076 Both this and the following perception are reflective contem­ plations on nibbana. In the classical scheme of forty meditation subjects, they can be subsumed under the "recollection of peace" (upasamanussati), explained at Vism 293-94, Ppn 8:245-51. 2077 Where Ce and Ee read pajahanto viramati anupadiyanto, Be has

**.** **_pajahanto viharati anupadiyanto._** **Mp offers no clarification.**
###### 2078 It is hard to see exactly how the explanation is connected to the theme of impermanence. Some manuscripts read this perception as sabbasankharesu anicchasafina, "perception of wishlessness (or desirelessness) in regard to all conditioned phenomena," which seems to tie up better with the definition: 2079 The mental activity (cittasankhara) here is perception and feeling, for these things are said to be bound up with the mind and to occur in dependence on it (see MN 44.15,1301,28-29). 2080 That is, liberating the mind from the obstacles to the refinement of serenity and insight. 2081 I read this sentence thus: "Purima bhikkhave koti na. pannayati avijjaya, ito pubbe avijja nahosi atha paccha samabhazn'-' ti: evametam bhikkhave vuccati. The punctuation in all three editions gives the impression that the only part of the Pali sentence that forms a direct quotation is that between ito pubbe and sambhavi. 1 think it more likely that evametam bhikkhave vuccati.applies to the state­ ment as a whole, from purima through sambhavi, rather than to only part of it, and I translate accordingly. 2082 Mp glosses "has a nutriment" (sdharam) with "has a condition" (sapaccayam). 2083 Though there are only nine items in the first part of this sutta (the negative series), it appears to be included in the Tens because there are ten items in the second part (the positive series). The next sutta uses the same scheme but augmented in the first part by craving for existence. 2084 There is a word play here. "Have reached certainty about me" (mayi nitthamgata) is an idiom meaning that a person has achieved secure faith in the Buddha, the mark of a stream-enterer. But nittha also means goal, namely, arahantship. Thus reaching cer­ tainty about the Buddha marks the attainment of stream-entry (or higher stages), while gaining the goal marks the attainment of arahantship. In the light of this distinction, Mp explains "gain the goal here in this world" (idha nittha) as "reach final nibbana in this very world" (imaSmijnyeva loke parinibbanam). "This world"

###### Notes to the Tens 1847

 stream-enterer and once-returner may reach the goal in a heav­ enly realm and not necessarily in the human realm. Mp says that "having left this world" (idha vihaya) means "in the pure abodes of the brahma world (suddhavasabrahmalokam)
 •2085 Ekablji, kolamkola, and sattakkhattuparama. These are three grades of stream-enterers in the technical sense. They are distinguished according to the sharpness of their spiritual faculties. For the distinctions between them, see 3:89. 20§6 For the distinctions between these five kinds of non-returners, see 7:55. They are mentioned in relation to the threefold training at 3:87 and 3:88. 2087 Here the text uses the word sotapanna in a loose sense. Mp -says it means those who have entered the "stream" of the noble path (ariyamaggasotam apanna). The word thus applies to disciples at all fo u r stages of awakening. 2088 Ee omits this passage, though acknowledging its presence in the manuscripts it drew upon. Ce and Be both include it. The transi­ tion to the Buddha's talk on the ten grounds of praise is unclear, unless We assume that, as in the preceding sutta, the Buddha had visited the monks and reproached them for engaging in pointless talk. 2089 This is a more compressed version of MN 6 ,1 33—36. The latter includes sections on the three lower stages of realization and the five mundane direct knowledges but excludes §§5-6 of this sutta. 2090 An expanded parallel of 5:63 and 5:64. 2091 A part-parallel of 6:44, with similar setting but different contents. 2092 Ce petta pi yo; Be pitamaho, Ee petta piyo. PED explains pitamaha (under pitar) as "grandfather," which seems unlikely here. PED. under pettapiya (epic Skt pitrvya), gives "father's brother, pater­ nal uncle," which can thus support Ce and Ee if the spaces are eliminated. See too pp. 1758-59, note 1330. 2093 1 take Ce -nano here to be a misprint for —nane. which occurs in the repetition of the statement toward the end of the sutta. In 6:44, Ce has —nane in both places. 2094 Dussllyam aparisesam nirujjhati. Mp: "Here, the five kinds of immorality are abandoned by the path of stream-entry; the ten
 [courses of unwholesome kamma], by the path of arahantship. At the moment of fruition they are said to have been abandoned. By nirujjhati the text here refers to the moment of fruition.

 fifth neither to decline nor growth. But how is virtuous behav­ ior broken by reaching arahantship? Because a worldling can have extremely wholesome virtuous behavior, but the path of arahantship leads to the destruction of wholesome and unwhole­ some kamma; thus it is broken in that way." This, it should be pointed out, is explained from the Abhidhamma standpoint, according to which an arahant's actions, being mere activities (kiriya) without kammic result, are not classified as either whole­ some or unwholesome. In the language of the suttas, however, they would be described as extremely wholesome. 2095 I translate on the basis of Ce and Be, which read tdyo me.. Ee consistently reads only tayo, without me. . 2096 I read with Ce and Ee micchaditthika, as against Be papaniitta, "have bad friends." 2097 An expanded parallel of 9:29. 2098 Atthane ca kuppati. Mp: "In relation to some intentionally moti-. vated event there can be a reason [for getting angry], as when someone acts for my harm/and so forth:.But this is not the case when one injures oneself against tree stumps and so forth. There­ fore, in this case it is said that the resentment is without a reason (atthane aghato)." 2099 An expanded parallel of 9:30. 2100. Also in 4:36. 2101 An expanded parallel of 8:82. 2102 I here read with Be Sati kho pana ayamayasma uttari karaniye, as against Ce and Ee Mutthassati kho pana ayamayasma uttari karaniye, "This venerable one, who is muddle-minded, when there is some­ thing further to be done..." In Be sati is a present participle used in a locative absolute construction; it is totally unrelated to the noun sati meaning mindfulness. Possibly the reading mutthassati arose through the influence of 10:85 §7 below. 2103 Ce repeats the exchange here once more, with the trickster telling his companion to dig still again. I follow Be and Ee, which omit this repetition. 2104 As with 10:84 §10,1 prefer the Be reading. 2105 This is the name in Ce. Ee reads kalakam, which could also be taken as a proper name. But Be has kalakatam, which means "one who has died." 2106 Ayampi dhammo na piyataya nagarutaya na bhavanaya ha samannaya na ekibhavaya samvattati. Mp glosses na sam annaya with na samanadhammabhavaya "nor to the state [or duty] of an ascetic." Mp obviously takes sSmanna to be derived from samana.

 intended here. I translate it as "accord," which agrees well with the next word, eklbhavaya. See too p. 1791, note 1623. Mp does not gloss bhavanaya, but in commenting on 8:2 it allows two alterna­ tives, "meditative development" and "esteem.for virtues." In this context I have taken the latter to be intended. A Chinese parallel, MA 94, at T1576a23-25, has for bhavanaya, "nor to meditative development"; and for samanna, "nor to obtaining the ascetic state." Despite this agreement between Mp and MA 9 4 ,1 still think it possible that the words were mis­ understood at an early period and prefer my rendering. 2107 This partly, replicates 5:211,. but the difference in formulation is too prominent for it to be called an expanded parallel of the earlier sutta. 2108 With Ce, Be, and Mp (Ce arid Be). I read saddhammassa na
 ■vodayanti. Ee has the singular verb vodayati, but the notes in Ee also refer to mss with vodayanti. Saddhammassa should be resolved saddhamma assa.Mp: "The good qualities of the teach­ ing;. consisting in the three trainings, do not become polished for him" (sikkhattayasahkhata sasanasaddhamma assa vodanam na gacchanti). 2109 Versions of this sutta are also at SN 6:9-10 and Sn 3:10. 2110 M a h'evam Kokalika, ma h'evam Kokalika. Sn p. 124 has the same reading, but SN I 150,7-8 reads: ma h'evam Kokalika avaca, ma h'evam Kokalika avaca. 2111 The unripe belli fruit is about the size of a peach, the ripe fruit the size of a pomegranate. 2112 The sutta refers to Tudu as a paccekabrahma. Neither Mp nor Mp-t define the term, but Spk-pt I 213 (VRI ed.), commenting on its occurrence at SN I 146,26-27, explains it as a brahma who travels about alone, not as a member of an asseiribly- (paccekabrahma ti ca ekacari brahma, na parisacarl brahmati attho). Mp.says that in his . past life he had been Kokalika's preceptor. He passed away as a non-returner and was reborn in the brahma world. When he heard that Kokalika was slandering Sariputta and Moggallana, he came to request him to place confidence in them. 2113 Since the Buddha had declared Tudu a non-returner, Kokalika reproaches him for reappearing in the human world. As a non- returner he does not, of course, take rebirth into the human worlds but he can manifest himself before humans. 2114 The following three verses are at 4:3. 2115 In the Indian numbering system one koti = ten million; a koti of kotis = one pakoti; a koti of pakotis = one kotipakoti; a koti of kotipakotis = one nahuta; a koti of nahutas = one ninnahuta; a koti

###### 2116 Mp states that the red-lotus (paduma) hell is not a separate hell realm but a particular place in the great avid hell where the dura­ tion of the torment is measured by units of padumas. The same applies to the abbuda hell, etc., mentioned below. 2117 Ce should be corrected by bringing the word dlgham down a line. Thus the paragraph begins with evam vutte and the question with klva dlgham nu kho bhante. The mistake is in both the printed and electronic versions of Ce. 2118 An expanded parallel of 8:28. 2119 In Ee titled Upasakavagga, "The Chapter on Lay Disciples." 2120 This is a part-parallel of SN 42:12, IV 331-37, but differing slightly in arrangement. Where there are mixed grounds for praise and criticism, SN 42:12 enumerates all the grounds for praise and criticism together, each in its own group, whereas the present sutta takes each item in the order in which it occurs, designating it a ground for either criticism or praise. 2121 The three variables of the pattern to be elaborated are: (i) how wealth is acquired, whether unrighteously, righteously, or both; (ii) whether or not it is used for one's own benefit; and (iii) whether or not it is used to benefit others. Those who rank positively on all three will be further divided into those who are attached to their wealth and those who are unattached to it. 2122 An expanded parallel of 9:27. It differs only by the addition of the section on dependent origination, which is also in the version of SN 12:41, I I 68-70, a full parallel. 2123 Mp: "The noble method (ariya nciya) is the path together with insight." 2124 This sutta is probably included in the Tens because of the ten views. 2125 Evam kho te, gahapati, moghapurisa kalena kalarn sahadhammena suniggahitam niggahetabba. Mp glosses sahadhammena as "with a cause, with a reason, with a statement" (sahetukena karanena vacanena). 2126 VibhajjavRdl bhagava, na so bhagava ettha ekamsavadl. The expres­ sion vibhajjavadl, used to describe the Buddha, is sometimes understood to mean that the Buddha analyzes things into their component parts. But the use of the term here (and elsewhere in the Nikayas) shows that it actually means that the Buddha draws the distinctions needed to avoid making broad generaliza­ tions that overlook important ambiguities. See how the term is employed at MN 99.4, II 197,io-i8. 2127 Like 10:93, this sutta was probably included in the Tens because it deals with the ten speculative views. 2128 Mp: " The most elevated question of all: 'Do not let him acquire the


-----

###### bad view: "When I ask the ascetic Gotama the ultimate question, he falters and does not reply. Is it the case that he isn't up to the mark and cannot answer?""' 2129 Mp: "The same question: He shows that Uttiya again asked the same invalid question that he had previously posed in terms of whether the world is eternal. He asks from a different angle about the entire world, taking a stand on the belief in a sentient being (sattupaladdhiyamyeva thatva annenakSrem pucchati)." 2130 In Be and Ee, Kokanuda. 2131 At 4:38 and 6 :5 4 ,1 render ditthitthana as "viewpoint," but here as "basis for view." I follow Mp, which glosses the word in its earlier occurrences as meaning views themselves, but here as "causes for views" (ditthikttrana). Mp mentions eight such causes: the aggregates, ignorance, contact, perception, thought, careless attention, bad friends, and another person's utterance (khandha, avijja, phasso, sahna, vitakko, ayoniso manasikaro, papamitta, paraghoso). 2132 I follow Be, whose reading of this stock passage conforms to the sequence found elsewhere in AN. Ce and Ee invert the order of the "exalted," "concentrated," and "liberated" dyads, so that the superior consistently follows the inferior state. The Ce and Ee readings of all the earlier AN suttas use the sequence of the Be reading, and there seems no reason here for this sequence to be inverted. 2133 Mp: "H e will sink (samsldissati) because of sensual thoughts, or float away (uplavissati) because of thoughts of ill will and harming." 2134 Much of the following comes from the standard sequence on the progressive training, already at 4:198. 2135 No ca kho tava anuppattasadattha viharanti. The stock formula for the arahant, at 3:37 and 6:49, describes the arahant as one who has "reached his own goal" (anuppattasadattho). Thus Mp II 235,14-15, and Mp III 380,i7-i8, commenting on the formula, iden­ tify sadattha with arahantship. 2136 I read with Be anuppattasadattha ca viharanti, which seems neces­ sary. Ce and Ee have, as in the earlier passages, no ca kho tava anuppattasadattha viharanti, "but they still have not attained their own goal." Since only nine meditative attainments are men­ tioned, it is unclear what justifies the inclusion of this sutta in the Tens. To obtain ten stages, I have divided the last stage into two parts, but I am unsure this was the original intention. 2137 Sanghe te viharato phaso bhavissati. Lit., "For you dwelling in the Sahgha, there will be ease [or comfort]." Mp: "[The Buddha] asks him to live in the midst of the Sahgha and does not permit him

###### to live in the forest. Why? [He thought:] 'If he lives in the forest, he will fulfill only the task of practice, not the task of learning. But if he lives in the midst of the Sahgha, he will fulfill the two tasks, attain arahantship, and become the foremost expert in the Vinaya Pitaka. Then, I will explain his past aspiration and resolu­ tion and appoint him as the foremost bhikkhu among the experts in the Vinaya.' Seeing this benefit, the Master did not permit Upali to live in the forest." 2138 Samamsanm. Identical with the first three of the "ten things that one who has gone forth should often reflect upon." See 10:48 for notes on these three themes. 2139 All three true knowledges are abridged in the text. 2140 Ps I 188,32-189,4, commenting on MN I 42,28, explains wrong knowledge (micchanana) as the delusion (moha) that arises when someone, having done a bad deed or pondered a bad thought, reflects on it and thinks, "I have done good." Wrong liberation (micchavimutti) arises when someone who is not liberated thinks "I'm liberated," or it is the belief that what is not liberation is true liberation. 2141 At Ps 1 188,35-189,9 right knowledge (sammanana) is explained to be the nineteen kinds of reviewing knowledge (see Vism 676,4 29, Ppn 22.20-21) and right liberation (samniavimutti) to be the men­ tal factors concomitant with fruition. I find it simpler to interpret "right knowledge" as the direct knowledge that culminates in arahantship and "right liberation" as the release of the mind from the asavas and other defilements. 2142 An expanded parallel based on 1:314 and 1:315. 2143 The same sutta, but only as far as micchasamadhi and samma- samadhi, is SN 45:1, V 1-2. Mp does not offer any substantial com­ ment here, but Spk III 116,5-6, commenting on the same sentence in SN 45:1, explains that ignorance is a forerunner (pubbahgama) in two ways, as co-arisen condition (sahajata, a condition for simul­ taneously arisen phenomena) and as decisive-support condition (upanissaya, a strong condition for subsequently arisen phenom­ ena). Spk-pt I I 103 (VRI ed.) adds that ignorance is a co-arisen forerunner when it makes simultaneous states conform to its own confusion about the object, so that they grasp impermanent phenomena as permanent, etc. It is both a co-arisen and decisive- support forerunner when a person overcome by delusion, not seeing the danger, takes life, steals, commits sexual misconduct, speaks falsely, and engages in other immoral actions. 2144 At Spk III 117,27-31 it is said that these do not occur all together in the mundane path but occur together in the world-transcending path. Even in the development of the mundane path it would be


-----

###### a mistake to suppose the eight factors follow in sequence. Right view is the guide for the other path factors and the direct condi­ tion for right intention. Right view and right intention jointly condition right speech, right action, and right livelihood. These in turn are the basis for right effort and right mindfulness. Right concentration results from the interplay of right effort and right mindfulness. Right knowledge (samma nana) is the wisdom of the path of arahantship, and right liberation (samma vimutti) is the liberation from the asavas that occurs through right knowledge. Its culmination is the arahant's anasava cetovimutti pannavimutti ("taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom"). 2145 Nijjara. The "wearing away" of old kamma through austerities was a fundamental Jain concept. The Buddha borrows the word but gives it a new meaning. See too 3:74 for three kinds of "w ear­ ing away" taught by the Buddha. 2146 Mp explains that in this country, people do not cremate their dead relatives but bury them. After their bodies have decayed, they excavate the bones, wash them, arrange them in order, and worship them with scents and garlands. When an [auspicious] constellation arrives, they take the bones and wail and lament, after which they play [the game of] constellation. 2147 Asekha. A term for an arahant, who has completed the training in the noble eightfold path and thus possesses, beyond the eight path factors, right knowledge (sammanana) and right liberation (sammavimutti). 2148 Adhammo ca bhikkhave veditabbo anattho ca; dhammo ca veditabbo attho ca. Here dhamma should be understood more in the sense of the principle of goodness and truth than in the narrow sense of the Buddha's teaching. And attha should be understood in the sense of what is good, beneficial, and profitable (in a spiritual sense), what leads to one's long-term well-being and happiness. The word also means "meaning." Often dhamma and attha are paired off as two things that are to be understood and appreci­ ated in the contemplative process, as in the expression atthaveda and dhammaveda, or atthapatisamvedi dhammapatisamvedl. 2149 What follows is a stock passage leading up to the elaboration of the brief teaching by one of the bhikkhus, usually either Mahakaccana or Ananda. 2150 A Chinese parallel occurs in MA 188. The first part, T1734a29-c24, roughly corresponds to 10:116, but it includes a block of text that mirrors MN 76.21, I 519,13-29, a satirical account of a cer­ tain teacher's claim to omniscience. A later part of the sutta, T I 734c25-735b25, is parallel to 10:115.

###### 2151 Pandita. The word means "wise one, learned one." I am uncertain whether this was a proper name or a sobriquet. 2152 Cittatthanasatcmi. Mp glosses with cittuppadasatani. It seems to me that reading cinta- in place of citta- would be more appropriate to the context. One Burmese manuscript referred to in the notes to Ee does in fact have this reading. 2153 Pandito vata bho pandito vata bho. This refers back to the name of the ascetic sophist. 2154 These first three cases are common to Ce, Be, and Ee. Be ends here, but Ce adds two further paragraphs, and Ee one paragraph, unique to that edition. 2155 The two paragraphs in brackets are in Ce but not in Be or Ee. It seems to me to be foreign to the thought-world of the Nikayas to pit two doctrines that accord with the Dhamma against one another in a contest aimed at refutation, and also incongruous for an "assembly that accords with the Dhamma" (dhammika parisa) to be described as "loud and boisterous" (uccasadda tnahasadda). Normally, this expression describes either an assembly of non- Buddhist wanderers (as in 10:93, V 185,14) or a group of unruly householders making a racket (as in 5:30, HI 30,27). On one occa­ sion it describes a group of bhikkhus (MN I 456,20-22), but they are promptly sent away by the Buddha. In place of these two paragraphs in Ce, Ee has a paragraph that reads as follows: "Someone refutes and disproves a doctrine contrary to the Dhamma with a doctrine that accords with the Dhamma. In this way, [231] he delights an assembly that accords with the Dhamma. For this reason, the assembly that accords with the Dhamma becomes loud and boisterous, exclaiming: 'He is truly wise, sir! He is truly wise, sir!"' It is quite normal, even expected, for a doctrine that accords with the Dhamma to pre­ vail over a doctrine contrary to the Dhamma, but again it seems incongruous for an assembly that accords with the Dhamma to become "loud and boisterous." 2156 These verses are also at Dhp 86-89. 2157 Te lake parinibbuta. This could also have been rendered, "They have attained nibbana in the world." 2158 PED explains paccorohani as "the ceremony of coming down again (?), approaching or descending to (acc.), esp. the holy fire." SED sv pratyavarohana says: "A particular Grhya [householder] festival in the month Margasirsa" (November-December). 2159 Paccorohama bhavantam, paccorohama bhavantam. It is apparently from this salutation that the paccorohani festival derives its name. SED explains the verb pratyavarohati to mean: "to descend (from a seat, chariot, etc.) in honor of (acc.)." Apparently, here

###### the brahmins are descending in honor of Agni, the god of fire, representing the all-pervasive energy of the universe. 2160 I follow Ce, which unlike Be and Ee, does not include dhammam in the sentence. 2161 I follow Be, which is consistent in putting the dark path before the bright path here and in 10:190. Ce and Ee put the bright path first here, but invert the sequence at 10:190. My title conforms to Be, whereas Ce has "The Bright Path" here but titles 10:190 "The Dark Path." 2162 This sutta and the following are parallels respectively of 10:119 and 10:120. 2163 This sutta and the next are parallels respectively of 10:117 and 10:118. 2164 There is parallelism between 10:171 and 10:113; 10:172 and 10:115; and 10:173 and 10:114. 2165 It was this Cunda that offered the Buddha his final meal. See DN
 ■ 16.4.17-19, I I 127. 2166 Soceyyani. The meaning is not immediately clear and Mp does not gloss the word. Soceyya normally means "purity, purification," but from the context it seems to refer to a kind of rite. 2167 The last four refer respectively to: (1) a woman protected by her co-religionists, (2) one already married or even promised to a husband at birth or in childhood, (3) one with whom sexual rela­ tions entail punishment, and (4) a girl who has been garlanded by a man as a sign of engagement. 2168 All three editions here read bajjhantu, "let them be bound." Mp provides no gloss but at MN I 287,ii we find vajjhantu, glossed by Ps II 332,16 as vadham papunantu, "let them be slaughtered," and by Ps-pt II 230 (VRI ed.) as maranam papunantu, "let them die." I thus take vajjhantu to be the correct reading. 2169 Pali: saddhanv, Skt sraddhani. SED sv sraddha says: "A ceremony in honour and for the benefit of dead relatives observed with great strictness at various fixed periods and on occasions of rejoicing as well as mourning by the surviving relatives (these ceremonies are performed by the daily offering of water and on stated occa­ sions by the offering of pindas or balls of rice and meal to three paternal and three maternal forefathers, i.e., to father, grand­ father, and ^reat grandfather; it should be borne in mind that a sraddha is not a funeral ceremony but a supplement to such a ceremony; it is an act of reverential homage to a deceased person performed by relatives, and is moreover supposed to supply the dead with strengthening nutriment after the performance of the previous funeral ceremonies has endowed them with ethe­ real bodies; indeed, until those anteyesti or 'funeral rites' have been performed, and until the succeeding first sraddha has been

 - 'When it is the wrong occasion [for sharing the merit of giving], does Master Gotama proclaim the fruitfulness of giving to that relative?' For the brahmin held the belief that the donor does not gain any fruit of a gift given thus. But the Blessed One, having acknowledged his question, shows: 'The donor gains the fruit of his gift wherever he is reborn, in any place where he is sustained by his meritorious fruits.'" 2173 This chapter is parallel to. the Third Fifty, Chapter IV; the next chapter, to the Third Fifty, Chapter V. 2174 This chapter is parallel to the Fourth Fifty, Chapter I. 2175 Ee merges these eleven suttas with the previous one, thus count­ ing only one sutta in the chapter, whereas Ce and Be, which I follow, have twelve distinct suttas. Thus from this point my numbering differs significantly from Ee. 2176 Except for the abridgment I do not detect any difference between this sutta and the previous one. I have translated the text just as it is, additionally abridging only the descriptions of wrong view and right view. None of the editions says anything about this. Mp does not comment on the first five suttas in this vagga, stating that their meaning is clear. 2177 Samsappanlyapariyayam vo bhikkhave dharnmapariyayam desessami. Mp: "An exposition of the Dhamma that has /creeping' as its subject matter." 2178 Mp: "In doing that action he creeps forward, creeps around, wriggles around." 2179 Uluka. The owl may have been included here because it operates furtively. The Chinese counterpart at T I 273c27-28 mentions only four animals: the snake, the mouse, the cat and the fox. 2180 The text has the genitive plural sancetanikanam kammanam. Out of deference to established English usage, I have used the sin­ gular "kamma." In view of the fact that kamma is by definition volitional (cetana 'harn bhikkhave kammam vadiimi), "volitional

 of "deed, action" and the extended meaning of a deed with the capacity to produce ethically determined fruits. The former meaning, perhaps, is accentuated by kata, "done," the latter by upacita, "accumulated, stored up" as well as by the reference to the time periods when it can ripen. 2181 On the threefold ripening of kamma, see pp. 1639-40, note 372. The Buddha's statement that there is no termination of volitional kamma so long as one has not experienced its results seems to contradict one of the main premises of his teaching, namely, that to attain liberation—"to make an end of suffering"—one need not experience the results of all the kamma one has accumulated in the past. This tenet (at least according to the Nikayas) was proposed by the Jains, as stated at MN 14.17, I 92,35-93,10; MN . 101.10, II 2 1 8 ,i-i2. However, since the cycle of rebirths is "with­ out discoverable beginning" (anamatagga samsara), and in this long stretch we have all accumulated an immensity of kamma, . it would virtually require infinite time to exhaust such kamma by experiencing its results. The Buddha taught that the key to liberation was not the eradication of past , kamma (whether by experiencing its results or by austerities) but the elimination of the defilements. Arahants, by terminating the defilements, extin­ guish the potential for ripening of all their past kamma beyond the residue that might ripen in their final life. Mp explains the text's statement as having an implicit meaning: "This is intended to show that as long as samsara continues, if there is kamma that has acquired the capacity to ripen (patiladdhavipakarahakamma) 'there is no place on earth where one might escape an evil deed'" (the citation, na vijjati so jagatippadeso, yatthatthito mucceyya papakamma, is from Dhp 127). The point, in other words, is not that all karhma created will have to ripen, but that any kamma created and accumulated retains the potential to ripen as long as one wanders On in the cycle of rebirths. A Chinese parallel of 10:219, MA 15 (T 1437b24—438bn), opens with a similar declaration as 10:217. The statement (at T1437b26-
**2g) reads in translation: "If one has done a past kamma, I say**
###### that one must experience its result: one experiences it either in the present life or in a future life. But if one has not done a past kamma., I say that one will not experience its result" (SWH&fF

 The Chinese parallel offers only two alternatives for the time of ripening and lacks anything corresponding to the problematic assertion, "I do not say that there is making an end of suffering so long as one has not experienced [the results of] volitional kamma

 in bodily action" (kayakammantasankhata vipatti). Apparently, Mp understands sandosa and bydpatti to convey the same meaning, glossed by vipatti, but I take the compound to be a dvanda: "cor­ ruption and failure." 2183 See p. 1672, note 582. 2184 Apparently this version differs from 10:217 only by abridging the expository sections and by omitting the simile of the dice. 2185 Although the text of the sutta (in the three editions) does not include a peyyala here, indicating an elision, it was probably right here that the sutta originally included the passage on the ten courses of kamma (as in the preceding two suttas). Only in this way would its inclusion in the Tens make sense. Fur­ ther, the transition to sa kho so . . . ariyasavako evam vigaiabhijiho vigatabyapddo asammulho in the next paragraph, with the refer­ ence to a definite subject, implies that it had been preceded by a passage that already spoke about the noble disciple. We find the full passage, in fact, in the Chinese parallel, MA 15, which is a synthesis of 10:217-18 and the present sutta. The structure of MA 15 is as follows: Following the opening statement, the Buddha defines the ten kinds of unwholesome kamma of body, speech, and mind. He then says that an instructed noble disciple discards the threefold unwholesome types of kamma (bodily, verbal, and mental) and cultivates the threefold wholesome types. At this point "that instructed noble disciple" ), possessing such energy and virtue, has purified his kamma of body, speech, and mind. He is without anger and hostility, has dispelled drowsiness, eliminated restlessness and arrogance, abandoned doubt, and gone beyond conceit. He is mindful, possesses clear comprehension, and is unconfused. He then pervades the ten directions and the entire world with a mind of loving-kindness and the other three immeasurables. 2186 Yam kho pana kind pamdnakatam kammam, na tarn tatrdvasissati, na tam tatravatitthati. Mp identifies "measurable kamma" with sense-sphere kamma (kdmdvacarakamma), that is, kamma due to produce its results in the sense sphere. Since the disciple being described is presumably a non-returner (or one bound to become a non-returner), he or she will take rebirth in the form realm and never again descend to the sense sphere. Thus the sense-sphere kamma cannot find an opportunity to ripen. 2187 As pointed out earlier, the Pali word kamma bears two senses often difficult to distinguish: the etymological sense, simply an action or deed, and the soteriological sense, a deed considered as a moral force that can bring retributive consequences. It is

###### Notes to the Tens 1859

 the liberation of mind by loving-kindness can do no bad deed. It seems to me that although such a person might not commit bad deeds motivated by hatred and ill wi 11, they could still do bad deeds, even minor ones, motivated by greed and delusion. 2188 This statement, too, seems counterintuitive. Those who do no bad deeds in this life certainly can suffer the kammic effects of bad deeds done in previous lives. Thus Moggallana was assassinated and the Buddha himself was badly injured by a sharp stone that broke off from the boulder hurled at him by Devadatta. Virtuous people who are not arahants might also undergo psychological suffering, and not merely physical pain, as a consequence of undesirable situations. For example, Ananda, a virtuous monk,. felt grief and worry when the Buddha fell ill and Visakha, a stream-enterer, lamented the death of her grandchild. 2189 Cittanlaro ayam bhikkhave macco. Mp: "They have mind as their cause, or their interior is due to mind (cittakarano,'atha Va citteneva- antariko). For with the mind at rebirth that follows without inter­ val the mind at death, one becomes a deva, a hell-being, or an animal." 2190 Karajakaya. I translate the expression literally but it may imply much the same thing as such English expressions as "this mortal body" or "this corporeal body." DOP sv kara, says: "A body pro­ duced by action, the physical body." SN 12:37, II 65,l, speaks of the body as "old kamma" (jpuranamidam.. .kammam). The Chinese parallel has nothing that corresponds to this term. 2191 Mp: "By means of loving-kindness, .the feeling that would have been experienced upon rebirth is cut off, and thus it does not follow one along. This is the reflection of a noble person who is a stream-enterer or a once-returner." Presumably, the bad kamma is all to be experienced here (sabbam tam idha vedqmyarn)/ in this life, and will not follow along (na. tam anugam bhavissati) because his next rebirth will be in the form realm, where there is no painful experience, and he will attain nibbana in the form realm without returning to this world. 2192 Idha pahhassa bhikkhuno uttarim vimuttim appativijjhato. Mp: "A wise bhikkhu here: The wisdom in this teaching is called 'wis­ dom here.' The meaning [of a wise one here] is a noble disciple who is settled in the noble wisdom that pertains to the teaching" (imasmim sasanepahiia idhapanna nama, sasanacaritayaariyapanhaya thitassa ariyasavakassa ti attho). 2193 Mp calls this the state of a "jhana non-returner" (jhananagamita). Such persons have realized the lower two fruits and attained the jhanas but have not yet really reached the stage of non-returner

 form realm, where they will attain the higher two paths and fruits without ever returning to the sense sphere; thus they are called "jhana non-returners." The "further liberation" (uttarim vimutti) is arahantship. See too p. 1664, note 539. 2194 Ee combines these three suttas with the previous one. 2195 Neither Ce nor Ee numbers this vagga. Ce, however, numbers the suttas in this series as if the vagga were to be counted as 3 (thus beginning with 10.5.3.1, where the second figure indicates the number of the Fifties and the third the number of the vagga). Be numbers it 23, in accordance with the consecutive numbering scheme it uses for the vaggas. Since the "Extra Fifty" has only twenty-six suttas without this vagga, I have numbered it "111/' on the assumption that it belongs in this set of Fifty. 2196 Ce numbers the suttas from 10.5.3.1 to 10.5.3*510. Be, using con­ secutive numbering for1 the entire nipata, numbers them from. 237 to 746; Ee numbers them from 217 to 219, collecting all the elaborations into 219,1 follow the.system of Be. ' 2197 It seems peculiar for riglit knowledge and right liberation to be treated as conditions for direct knowledge, for (as denoting the knowledge, and liberation of the arahant) they are normally themselves the results of direct knowledge. 2198 Here Ce and Ee additionally insert upasamaya ("for the pacifica­ tion").

Note that whereas, in the Tens, Sariputta answers the question in a different way than the Bud­ dha (but presumably referring to the same state of concentra­ tion), here his answer agrees with the Buddha's. 2205 Ee treats the passage from here to the end as a separate sutta, which it numbers 8 . Thus from this point on its numbering

 dialogue to belong to 11:7. The last sentence, applauding the agreement between the Buddha's explanation and Sariputta's, confirms that both are parts of a single sutta. In contrast, 10:6 and 10:7, which are also dialogues on this samadhi respectively between Ananda and the Buddha, and Ananda and Sariputta, have no bridge that unites them. 2206 Mp identifies the "foremost state" (aggapada) with nibbana. 2207 By counting the sense faculties and their objects, this sutta includes more than eleven items. But to maintain the elevenfold scheme, 1 begin numbering the relevant items with "earth." 2208 Be has the name as Saddha. 2209 Jhayati pajjhayati nijjhayati avajjhayati. As in 6:46, 111 354,a-io, the tone is derisive. 2210 Yassa te nabhijandma, yampi nissdya jhayasi. See MN 22.36,1 140, w/; "When the devas with Indra, Brahma, and Pajapati, search for a monk tlrus liberated in mind, they do not find that on which the consciousness of one who has thus attained is dependent. Why so? I say that one who has thus attained is untraceable even in . this very life" (evam vimuttacittam kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhuni sa-inda deva sabrahmaka sapajapatika anvesam nadhigncchanti 'idam nissitam tathagatassa virmdnan' ti. Tam kissa hetu? Ditth’evahambhikkhave, dhamme tathagatam ananuvijjo ti vadami). 2211 Pathaviyam pathavisanna vibhuta hoti. Mp glosses vibhuta here with "evident" (pakata), explaining: "The perceptions of the four or five jhanas arisen with earth, etc., as object are evident. . . because they have been seen with insight as impermanent, suf­ fering, and non-self ." Mp tries to support its interpretation with a citation it says is from a sutta: vibhuta, bhante, rupasanna avibhuta atthikasannd. However, a search through CST 4.0 fails to locate these words anywhere in the Nikayas. To my knowledge, in the Nikayas vibhuta always means "disappeared, vanished." See the expressions vibhutasanni at Sn 874, and vibhutarupasanfiissa at Sn 1113, where in both cases vibhuta can only mean "disap­ peared." There seems no reason to ascribe a later meaning to it here. A Chinese parallel, SA 926 (at TII 235c26-236bn), supports this conclusion. Taking earth as an example (at II 236a27), it reads: "A bhikkhu is able to suppress the perception of earth in relation to the perception of earth" Could the middle

 to obtain eleven items. It might thus be considered a composite eleven. The formula on the arahant is also in 7:61. Mp explains "ultimate conclusion" (accantanittho) thus: "The indestructible nibbana is his conclusion; it is called 'ultimate' (accanta) because it surpasses the end (antam atitattd)." 2214 A part-parallel of 6:10. 2215 I translate this freely in accordance with natural English diction. More literally it would read: "Bhante, among the various ways in which we dwell, how should we dwell?" 2216 Brahmali writes: "It is worth noting that a layperson speaks of entering upon the rains residence. Perhaps this was a common phenomenon in northern India, and not just restric ted to samanas. Maybe it was generally too difficult to travel." 2217 Mp identifies the asamayavimutto with the arahant. In relation to the expression in 6:55, "does not see in himself anything still to be done or [any need] to increase what has been done" (asamaya- . vimiitto karanlyafn attano na samanupassati katassa vd paticayam), Mp has glossed paticayam with "progress by repeatedly doing" (punappunam karanena vaddhim). 2218 Neither Ce nor Be use a ti to signal the end of a direct quotation, and thus on their readings it is not easy to determine exactly where the meditation formula ends. Ee inserts ti here, which signifies that the form ula ends here and that it includes the simile and the repetition. The devas that subsist on edible food belong to the sense sphere. Those that have been reborn in a mind-made body belong to the form sphere. It is not clear why it is said that they "do not see in themselves anything still to be done or
 [any need] to increase what has been done" (td karanlyam attano na sarnanupasSanii katassa vd paticayam). This phrase is normally reserved for the arahant. I can only surmise that the text is allud­ ing to those devas that have attained arahantship. 2219 I read with Be and Ee aggi mutto, as against Ce aggimukko. 2220 Saddhassa updsakassa putto. This might have also been rendered "the son of the male lay follower Saddha," taking saddha to be a proper name. But in such a case I would expect nama to have been included. Be reads sudattassa updsakassa putto, "the son of the male lay follower Sudatta." Sudatta was the proper name of Anathapindika, but Anathapindika's children would surely have been well known to the Buddha and thus his inquiry about the monk's identity would be strange. Further, except under rare . conditions, the Nikayas do not refer to Anathapindika by his personal name. 2221 Saddhapadanesu-vMp: "In the manifestation, the characteristics, of

**2 2 2 2** **An expanded parallel of 8 :1** **. This is the version that is usually**
###### recited as a protective discourse. 2223 The eleven benefits are explained in detail at Vism 311-14, Ppn 9.59-76. 2224 Identical with MN 52. 2225 The. householder is described as gahapati atthakanagara, where -nagarci means "a citizen of [such and such] a city." The word for city itself is nagara. This is analogous to calling a person from New York a New Yorker, one from Paris a Parisian, etc. 2226 Ten'eva dhamniaragena dhammanandiya. As at 9:36; see p. 1827, note 1917. Mp: "What is meant by this pair of terms is desire and lust for serenity and insight. For if one is able to exhaust all desire and lust for serenity and insight, one becomes an arahant. If one cannot do so, one becomes a non-retumer. Because one has not abandoned desire and lust for serenity and insight, through, the volition of the fourth jhana one is reborn in the pure abodes. This is the general explanation among the teachers." 2227 The base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception is not included because it is considered too subtle for its constituent factors to be used as objects of contemplation. 2228 The eleven "doors to the deathless" are the four jhanas, the four immeasurables, and the lower three formless attainments. They are used as bases to develop insight and attain arahantship. 2229 That is, five hundred kahSpanas. 2230 Identical with MN 33. 2231 At SN 47:6, V 148,1-2, the four establishments of mindfulness are called the pasture (gocara) of a bhikkhu, that is, the proper sphere of his attention. 2232 The dialogue here is identical with the first part of 11:7. 2233 Be does not include this series of suttas, perhaps assuming that it was implied by the preceding. Ee includes it only as three short sections within the larger sutta on the simile of the cowherd. 2234 Ee does not number this vagga. Both Ce and Be number it 4. 2235 Ce numbers the suttas in this vagga starting from 1 and ending at 170, Be numbers them in continuation with those in the entire nipdta. Since it did not include the positive version of the cow­ herd simile, Be begins with 502 and ends with 671. I use both schemes but begin the absolute count with 982.
