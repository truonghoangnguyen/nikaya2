# Preface

The present work offers a complete translation of the Anguttara Nikāya, the fourth major collection in the Sutta Pitaka, or "Basket of Discourses," belonging to the Pāli Canon. An English translation of the Anguttara Nikāya published by the Pali Text Society has long been in print under the title The Book of the Gradual Sayings. It was issued in five volumes, I, II, and V translated by F. L. Woodward, and III and IV by E. M. Hare. First published between 1932 and 1936, this translation is now dated both in style and technical terminology, and thus a fresh English rendering of the entire work has long been a pressing need. In the late 1990s I collected Nyanaponika Thera's four-part series of Wheel booklets, An Anguttara Nikāya Anthology, into a single volume for the International Sacred Literature Trust. I added sixty suttas to the original anthology, and the resulting volume was published as Numerical Discourses of the Budaha: An Anthology of Suttas from the Anguttara Nikāya (Walnut Creek, CA: AltaMira Press 1999). This compilation, with a total of 208 suttas, contained perhaps an eighth of the full Anguttara Nikāya. Translations of many individual Anguttara suttas have also been available over the internet, but a selection, however valuable, cannot do service for a translation of the complete work.

This translation, like my previous renderings from the Pāli Canon and commentaries, aims to fulfill two ideals that are to some degree in tension with one another: first, to be faithful to the meaning of the original; and second, to express this meaning in clear contemporary English. My translation is based on three different editions of the Pāli text. I used the Sinhala-script Buddha Jayanti edition as my root text, and I am grateful to Ven. Dhammajīva Thera of Mitirigala Nissarana Vanaya for presenting me with a full set of these volumes. I compared this
edition with the Vipassana Research Institute's electronic version of the Burmese-script Chattha Sangāyana (Sixth Council) edition and with the PTS's Roman-script edition. I also consulted the variants noted in the PTS edition, which occasionally, in my view, had a better reading than the printed editions. In defense of this "eclectic" approach I appeal to Professor E. Hardy's words in his preface to part V of his PTS edition of the Anguttara Nikāya: "It may be open to dispute, whether our Sinhalese Mss. [manuscripts] of the Anguttara are the more reliable, or our Burmese. . . . As a rule, there is no Ms. nor any set of Mss. which can be relied on indiscriminately" (p. v).

The contents of the Anguttara Nikāya (AN) prove especially challenging to modern readers because there is virtually no "rhyme or reason" to their order apart from their conformity to the numerical scheme that governs each book. To help the reader make sense of the work, I prepared a thematic study guide to AN, which follows the introduction (see pp. 75-84). The guide lays out the principal themes of this collection in a meaningful sequence, which is similar to the one I used in my anthology In the Buddha's Words. On this basis I then classified the suttas (the great majority, though not all) according to the way they exemplify the scheme. I suggest that readers new to AN consider reading the work twice. First, read the suttas in the order in which they fit into the thematic guide; then read the entire Nikāya again in the original order, from the Ones through the Elevens. The first reading will enable readers to grasp the main contours of the Buddha's teachings as they are represented by AN; the second will enable them to follow the work in its original arrangement. My long introduction is primarily intended to explain AN using the thematic guide as a framework for making sense of the mountain of material found in this collection.

In the course of preparing this translation, I have had the generous help of several people whose contributions have been invaluable. First and foremost is John Kelly, who offered his help even before I actually embarked on the project and unfailingly assisted me through the six years it has taken to bring the work to completion. A keen student of Pāli since 2003, John read the translation alongside the Pāli text at several stages, offering useful comments and suggestions and occasionally catching lines of text that I had overlooked. He maintained the electronic
files, entered the page numbers of the PTS edition into the files, compiled the two appendixes and index of proper names, and checked page proofs. His article, "The Buddha's Teachings to Lay People," which I cite several times in the introduction, is a bountiful source of information that helps us better understand the place of the Anguttara Nikāya in the corpus of Buddhist canonical literature. Occasionally John's wife Lynn also offered suggestions.

Another major helper was Bhikkhu Brahmāli of Bodhinyana Monastery in Serpentine, Australia. Ven. Brahmāli read the translation alongside the Pāli text in two stages, offering incisive comments. Often his comments necessitated revisions in the draft or required me to add explanatory notes to clarify the reasons behind my rendering. On a few occasions I have quoted Ven. Brahmāli's comments in my notes.

Ven. Vanarata Ānanda Thera, a senior bhikkhu in Sri Lanka, checked my translations of the verse portions of AN. He wrote extremely helpful comments into a printout of the manuscript, which Bhikkhu Nyanatusita kindly photographed and sent to me by email. I have occasionally included Ven. Vanarata's remarks in the notes.

Bhikkhu Pāsādiko, William Pruitt, and Bhikkhu Khemaratana read various versions of the translation and offered useful suggestions and comments. Pamela Kirby reviewed the proofs with sharp eyes for minor typographical and stylistic flaws. My student Pohui Chang helped review the indexes and checked my Chinese renderings in the notes.

I must also thank Tim McNeill and the team at Wisdom Publications for such a fine job of production, consistent with their treatment of the earlier volumes in this series. I reserve a special word of thanks to David Kittelstrom, Megan Anderson, and Laura Cunningham for their work on the present volume.

I am grateful to all these helpers for their selfless assistance, offered entirely from their love of the Dhamma. May they share in any merits that might arise from the publication of this work. I myself, of course, take responsibility for any errors or faults that remain.

The retroflexes (or cerebrals) are spoken with the tongue on the roof of the mouth; the dentals with the tongue behind the upper teeth. The aspirates- $k h, g h, c h, j h, t ̣ h, d h, t h, d h$, $p h, b h$-are single consonants pronounced with slightly more force than the non-aspirates, thus th as in "Thomas" (not as in "thin"); ph as in "puff" (not as in "phone"). Double consonants are always enunciated separately, thus $d d$ as in "mad dog," $g g$ as in "big gun." The niggahita, the pure nasal $m$, is pronounced like the $n g$ in "song." An $o$ and an $e$ always carry a stress; otherwise the stress falls on a long vowel- $\bar{a}, \bar{\imath}, \bar{u}$, or on a double consonant, or on $m$.

# Introduction

## The Anguttara Nikāya as a Collection

The Anguttara Nikāya is the fourth of the four major Nikāyas making up the Sutta Pitaka of the Pāli Canon, the collection of texts that Theravāda Buddhists regard as buddhavacana or "word of the Buddha." The work is arranged according to a pedagogical technique often employed by the Buddha, namely, the use of a numerical scheme as the underpinning of a discourse. In a period in Indian history when writing might not have been known, ${ }^{1}$ or in any case was not used to record spiritual teachings, memorization and preservation of the teachings required that they could be easily retained in mind. The use of numbers served this purpose well. Anyone who has regularly given lectures knows how helpful it is to draw up an outline that organizes the theme of the lecture into a numerical list. Precisely this is the principle that lies behind the suttas, or discourses, of the Anguttara Nikāya.

The word anguttara is a compound that might be rendered "increasing-by-a-factor." The compilation is occasionally referred to in the commentaries as the Ekuttaranikāya, "the collection increasing by one," and also as the Anguttarāgama. This suggests that in the age of the commentators, several ways of designating the work were still in circulation. The corresponding work in the Northern Buddhist tradition is known as the Ekottarāgama or Ekottarikāgama, āgama ("heritage") being the word used in the Northern tradition in place of nikāya to designate the compilations of discourses. One full version of the Ekottarāgama in Chinese translation is included in the Chinese Tripitaka. The occasional use of the word āgama in the Pāli commentaries to designate the discourse collections indicates that the Northern Buddhists had no monopoly on this word.

The name Anguttara is given to this collection because it is arranged according to a scheme in which the number of items in the suttas of each successive part increases incrementally over those of the preceding part. The collection contains eleven nipatas or "books" named simply after their numerical basis: the Ekakanipata, the Book of the Ones; the Dukanipata, the Book of the Twos; and so forth up to the Ekadasakanipata, the Book of the Elevens. From the Book of the Sixes upward we occasionally find that the number of items needed for a sutta to fit into the scheme is obtained by combining smaller sets.

The summary verse (uddäna) at the end of the last volume states that the Anguttara Nikāya contains 9,557 suttas. An exact figure is hard to arrive at because it is uncertain whether particular suttas are to be counted separately or as composite wholes. The large figure probably results from counting separately all the suttas generated by the "Lust and So Forth Repetition Series" found at the end of each nipata after the first (see below, pp. 62-63). According to my numbering scheme, AN contains a total of 8,122 suttas, of which 4,250 belong to the "Lust and So Forth Repetition Series." This means that there are only 3,872 suttas independent of that series. Many of these, however, occur in repetition sequences of their own, so even this figure is misleading if it is taken to imply that the contents of the suttas are autonomous. For example, the total number of suttas in the Fives, the Sevens, and the Elevens is greatly inflated by the inclusion in each of entire series of suttas derived from permutations. If these are bracketed, the number of independent suttas would be much reduced. The following table shows the total number of suttas in each nipata and in the "Lust and So Forth Repetition Series."

In each nipata, the suttas are gathered into vaggas, which may be called "chapters." The vaggas are constructed according to an ideal plan according to which they would each contain ten suttas, but-given that ideals are seldom realized in our world, even in Buddhist scriptures-in individual cases the actual number may vary from as many as 262 down to a minimum of seven. On occasion all, or most, of the suttas in a single vagga may relate to a single topic, indicated by the vagga's title, but this is rare. It is much more common for merely two or three suttas-and often only one-to bear a clear relation to the title.
| Nipata | Total Number <br> of Suttas | Lust etc. Repetition <br> Suttas | Independent <br> Suttas |

| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |

| Ones | 627 | - | 627 |

| Twos | 479 | 170 | 309 |

| Threes | 352 | 170 | 182 |

| Fours | 783 | 510 | 273 |

| Fives | 1152 | 850 | 302 |

| Sixes | 649 | 510 | 139 |

| Eights | 627 | 510 | 117 |

| Total | 8,122 | 4,250 | 3,872 |

Table 1. Total Number of Suttas

There is no apparent significance in the sequence of vaggas, though we might suppose that the redactors included in the first few vaggas of any book suttas they considered especially weighty. Although on a first reading the apparently haphazard organization of AN may be disconcerting, over time this becomes one of the most enjoyable features of the collection, exposing the knowledgeable reader to a constantly shifting succession of topics and ideas without allowing preconceptions to determine what will come next. All the reader can know for certain is that the successive suttas will conform to the numerical plan that governs the individual book (but sometimes even this is hard to detect).

The suttas of the Anguttara Nikāya, it seems, were not originally given titles as we understand the word. Modern editions, such as the Sri Lankan Buddha Jayanti and Burmese Chattha Sangāyana versions, do title them, but these titles are the work of recent editors. The typical procedure was to include, at the
end of each vagga, an uddāna or summary verse, which labels each sutta by a key word related to its subject matter. I have drawn my sutta titles from the uddānas, and they are therefore very short. Some vaggas do not have summary verses, and thus their suttas are untitled. This is especially the case with those that are extremely short, such as the suttas of the Ones and the Twos.

While the four main Nikāyas of the Sutta Pitaka are each highly variegated, close examination of their contents suggests that each has a dominant purpose in conveying a particular aspect of the Buddha's message. This concern, I should stress, is by no means evident in every sutta in the respective collection but only pertains to the collection when viewed as a whole. The Digha Nikāya is largely governed by the aim of propagating Buddhism within its cultural milieu. Its suttas attempt to establish the supremacy of the Buddha and his Dhamma over their competitors on the Indian religious and social scene. Thus the first sutta of DN surveys the philosophical views that the Buddha flatly rejected, the second repudiates the teachings of six contemporary teachers, while many of the following texts pit the Buddha in debate against brahmins and members of other sects; other suttas serve the purpose of glorifying the Buddha and demonstrating his superiority to the gods, the nature spirits, and the ascetics and contemplatives who traveled over the Ganges plain. The Majjhima Nikāya, on the other hand, turns its spotlight inward on the Buddhist community. Many of the suttas deal with the fundamentals of the doctrine and with meditation and other aspects of Buddhist practice. This makes it particularly well suited for the instruction of monks who need to be integrated into the community.

The Samyutta Nikāya and Anguttara Nikāya consist mostly of short suttas and thus lack the scenarios and dramatic confrontations that make the two longer collections so fascinating. The Samyutta is governed by a thematic principle and contains many short suttas disclosing the Buddha's radical insights and the topography of the path. This collection would have served the needs of two types of specialists in the monastic order. One were those monks and nuns who were capable of grasping the deeper ramifications of Buddhist wisdom and were therefore charged with clarifying these for others. The other were those
who had already fulfilled the preliminary stages of meditative training and were intent on developing insight and realizing the goal.

With the move from the Samyutta to the Anguttara Nikāya, a shift in emphasis takes place from comprehension to personal edification. Because the short suttas that explain the philosophical "theory" and the main methods of training found their way into the Majjhima and the Samyutta, what remained to be incorporated into the Anguttara were short suttas whose primary concern is practical. To some extent, in its practical orientation, the Anguttara partly overlaps the last book of the Samyutta, which contains chapters devoted to the seven groups that make up the thirty-seven "aids to enlightenment" (bodhipakkhiyā dhammā). To avoid unnecessary duplication, the redactors of the canon did not include these suttas again in the Anguttara under their numerical headings. The topics do appear in the repetition series at the end of each nipāta, but here their role is stereotyped and secondary. The Anguttara focuses instead on aspects of practical training that are not comprised in the standard sets, thereby helping us understand the Buddhist training from new angles. Perhaps we might say that if the last part of the Samyutta gives us an anatomy of the Buddhist path, the Anguttara takes a physiological slant on the path, viewing it by way of its dynamic unfolding rather than by way of its constituents.

It would be unrealistic, however, to insist that a single criterion has governed the compilation of the Anguttara Nikāya, which includes material from the Vinaya, lists of eminent disciples, cosmological ideas, and odd registers of terms that defy easy categorization. What can be said with confidence is that a broad survey of its contents would show a preponderance of texts dealing with Buddhist practice. Their subjects range from the basic etlical observances recommended to the busy layperson, through the pillars of mind training, to the highest meditative state, the samädhi or concentration of the arahant.

# Approaching the Anguttara

Because the suttas of AN constantly shift from one topic to another with little to connect them apart from the exemplification
of a particular numerical scheme, readers of this Nikāya often come away bewildered. While they may profit from individual suttas, they can discern no way to fit them together into an intelligible whole. The text itself is not particularly helpful in this respect, for it does not articulate a comprehensive framework that reveals the contours of its teachings.

The Dīgha Nikāya and the Majjhima Nikāya, of course, are also arranged in an apparently haphazard manner, with little more than a simple theme governing each vagga or chapter. But because these collections are composed of suttas that are either long or of middle length-as their respective titles indicate their contents are substantial enough to engage the reader with material for reflection and contemplation. The major discourses in these Nikāyas also show a sufficient degree of internal organization to reveal the chief categories into which the Buddha's discourses are cast: the courses of wholesome and unwholesome kamma, the graduated training, dependent origination, the four establishments of mindfulness, the four noble truths, and so forth. Though the Samyutta Nikāya contains mostly short suttas, the method of grouping connected texts dealing with a single theme makes fewer demands on the reader's patience than a collection with no intelligible organizational principle.

When it comes to AN, however, a neophyte reader may feel as if he or she has been dropped off in a boat far out at sea, with no land in sight and without a compass or map. I pick a chapter at random-the sixth vagga of the Book of the Fives-and I find the following: two suttas on the five hindrances (one embellished with a simile, the other little more than an enumeration); a sutta on the five factors of striving, followed by another on the five wrong and right occasions for striving; a sutta about the perils that separate mother and son; next, one on the training of a monk; a discourse on five themes for reflection; next, one on the proper uses of wealth; and finally two brief suttas on the hardships of those who enter monastic life in old age. With such apparently arbitrary organization, one cannot but wonder what the compilers had in mind when they assembled the chapter.

To assist the reader, I have developed a thematic guide to the Anguttara Nikāya that organizes the contents of the collection in accordance with a systematic pattern. The scheme, which follows the introduction on pages $75-84$, is similar to the
one I used as the scaffolding for my anthology In the Buddha's Words. I do not assign every sutta in AN to a niche in this guide. Some suttas resist classification, while others are too short or insubstantial for inclusion. Rather than try to be all-inclusive, I have proposed a framework, with divisions and subdivisions, and included enough discourses under each heading to enable the reader to see how the texts of AN can be fit together into a meaningful pattern.

Inevitably, the attempt to assign particular suttas to specific categories involved abstraction and painful decision-making. Many suttas in AN can be viewed from different points of view, any of which could have resulted in a sutta being placed in different categories. For instance, the suttas often explain practices or qualities by way of the persons who exemplify them, or alternatively, they explain persons by way of their practices and qualities. Thus I had to decide whether the sutta should be classified in terms of practices and qualities or in terms of persons. In some cases a given sutta covers a range of topics and thus fits comfortably into several categories. I did not want my guide to turn into an index, which would lack the degree of specificity needed to help the reader fit the sutta into the ground plan of the whole. Thus, while my ideal was "one sutta, one category," I often had to assign a single sutta to two categories and sometimes to three. However, I do not think I have exceeded three places for a single sutta.

The broadest categories that I used for the scheme are the "Three Jewels": the Buddha; the Dhamma, and the Sangha. I begin with the section on the Buddha, honoring him as the founder of the Buddhist heritage and the ultimate source of all the teachings comprised in the Anguttara Nikāya. Section II, titled "The Dhamma and Discipline," deals with the Buddha's teaching as a body of instructions that can be summarized, applied, and realized, and also as a corpus of texts that need to be preserved and transmitted to posterity. Following this section come eight sections devoted to the teachings themselves. This portion of the outline is intended to cover the Dhamma in its full range as we find it in AN. It begins with a survey of the Buddha's worldview (section III), covering the cosmological background to the Buddhist liberation project, the problematic nature of human experience, and the determinants of human
destiny. I then proceed in stages through the different forms of Buddhist practice, beginning with life in the world: family relations, livelihood, wealth, community, and state (section IV). These spheres of human activity are often neglected by writers on Buddhism, who succumb to the error of assuming that monastic practice represents the Dhamma in its entirety. The Anguttara is a treasury of inspiring and informative discourses on righteous living in the confines of the world, and these texts are essential to arriving at an adequate picture of early Buddhism.

While the Buddha stressed the virtues conducive to domestic harmony, his teaching does not stop there but leads on to the training for a higher rebirth and ultimate liberation. Though the former of these two trainings was directed toward lay disciples and the latter toward the bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, the two share many values. These values constitute a common platform of spiritual cultivation for both lay disciples and monastics. Under this theme, I have gathered into section V a variety of texts that concentrate on the practices of the devoted lay disciple who is not content merely to observe an ethical life but also seeks to advance along the path to liberation. The Anguttara Nikāya is a rich source of guidance for earnest lay followers, and this section attempts to do justice to such texts.

To inspire in his followers an aspiration for the final goal, the Buddha highlights the defects and dangers of mundane existence, which illustrate the noble truth of suffering. Section VI therefore groups together a number of topics and texts devoted to the task of "dispelling the world's enchantment." What binds us to conditioned existence, with its round of repeated birth and death and the danger of descent to lower realms of rebirth, are the defilements of the mind. Suttas dealing with this topic play a very prominent role in AN, and these have been gathered into section VII. The next division, section VIII, groups together suttas on the monastic training, which flows out from the spirit of renunciation and aims at the attainment of nibbäna. The heart of the monastic training is the practice of meditation, which is given a section of its own, section IX. Here I have allocated suttas that emphasize the practices that lead to the higher states of concentration (samädhi). Section X takes us into the next phase of the higher training, the development of wisdom (pañ $\tilde{\bar{a}}$ ), cul-
minating in liberation and the realization of nibbāna, the final goal of the teaching.

The next portion of the outline represents the third Jewel of Buddhism, the Sangha. It deals with both the institutional Sangha, the order of ordained monks and nuns (bhikkhus and bhikkhunis), and the ariyasangha, the community of noble ones, those who have attained the paths and fruits of enlightenment.

The last major section of the ground plan deals with types of persons. This is an area where the Anguttara differs significantly from the Samyutta. The major chapters of the Samyutta focus on the main philosophical themes of the teaching, the principles and categories that the Buddha proposed as templates for contemplation and insight. Thus we find in the Samyutta huge chapters on dependent origination, the elements, the five aggregates, the six sense bases, and the path factors, often explained in bare phenomenological terms with only minimal references to actual persons. The Anguuttara, in contrast, abounds in different ways of classifying people-both monastics and laypeople, noble ones and ordinary people-and it gives primacy to their qualities, their struggles for happiness and meaning, their aspirations and attainments. The Anguttara thus became the inspiration and a major source for one of the books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka, the Puggalapaññatti or "Descriptions of Persons," the one treatise in the collection that departs from the strict Abhidhamma method of phenomenological reduction in order to survey types of persons as they relate to the values and goals of the Dhamma.

# The Buddha in the Anguttara Nikaya

In what follows I will explore the contents of AN through the major categories of the Thematic Guide, highlighting prominent themes that emerge in this Nikāya and citing suttas that exemplify them. At the risk of being repetitive, I have to assert once again that the assignment of individual suttas to particular categories is largely done for the sake of expediency and risks nullifying the complexity in the contents of particular texts.

In a work that focuses largely on persons, it is fitting that we
find a substantial number of suttas devoted to the Buddha himself, not merely as the teacher and expounder of the Dhamma, but as a person with his own life story and achievements. I have distinguished the suttas that deal with the Buddha into three classes: those that refer to his life and thus constitute the building blocks of a biography; those that extol his spiritual qualities and attainments; and, as a distinct category, those that speak of the Buddha not so much as a unique individual but as an archetype, the exemplar of the fully enlightened teacher who embodies his message in his person. This last heading comprises those suttas in which the Buddha speaks of himself as "the Tathāgata."

The Nikāyas never sought to construct a continuous biography of the Buddha. The suttas that refer to events in his life are widely spread out in the different collections and seldom provide the clues that would be needed to connect these into a single coherent sequence. The Mahāparinibbāna Sutta (DN 16) gives us a connected account of the Buddha's last days, culminating in his death and cremation. But beyond this, the biographical material has to be ferreted out from widely scattered texts, and we must rely on speculation, imagination, and hints in the texts themselves (such as settings and occasional references to related incidents) to assign these to specific phases of the Buddha's life.

Nevertheless, AN does allude to the incidents familiar to us from the connected accounts of his life that were composed later. We can see these perhaps as the raw material that the poets and hagiographers would draw upon to construct the glorious Buddha biography. Thus 4:127 speaks about the wonders that accompanied his conception in the womb, his physical birth, his enlightenment, and his setting in motion the wheel of the Dhamma. In 3:39 he speaks about his delicate and luxurious upbringing, and he recounts the reflections on old age, illness, and death that roused him from his intoxication with youth, health, and life. He discusses his efforts to master the various stages of meditation during his struggle for enlightenment in 8:64 and 9:40, two accounts that are not included in the familiar Buddha biography. Sutta 5:196 tells of the five dreams that he had while still a bodhisatta, foretokens of his awakening, and 8:11 relates the traditional account of the enlightenment as
proceeding through the four jhānas and the three higher knowledges to the destruction of the taints. In 4:21 he tells of his reflections after his enlightenment and of his decision to honor only the Dhamma. In 8:70 he claims that if he so wished, he could live out the eon, and he decides to "relinquish his life force" because Ānanda failed to request him to extend his life. This incident is familiar to us from the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta.

While texts offering biographical information on the Buddha are relatively sparse, those that extol his virtues and attainments are plentiful. He is praised as the "one person who arises in the world...out of compassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and human beings" (1:170). His bodily form is endowed with such extraordinary marks that an inquisitive brahmin cannot believe he is a mere human being (4:36). He has perfected noble virtue, concentration, wisdom, and liberation (4:1). He possesses the qualities expected of a fully accomplished spiritual teacher (5:100). He is praised by the monk Udāyī in verses of great beauty (6:43) and extolled by his lay disciple King Pasenadi (10:30). He dwells in the world detached from the world, with all defilements gone, free from birth, old age, and death, like a lotus flower that is "born in the water and grown up in the water, but rises up above the water and stands unsoiled by the water" (4:36, 10:81).

The suttas in which the Buddha speaks of himself as the "Tathāgata" are sufficiently impressive to warrant being assigned to a class of their own. In these suttas I see the Buddha referring to himself not simply as a unique individual but as the latest representative of the "dynasty" of Buddhas, those extraordinary beings who appear at rare intervals in the cosmic process to rediscover the lost path to nibbāna and teach it to the world. In AN, we find explicit references to only two of the six Buddhas of the past that we know from other Nikāyas. Sikhī, the fifth back, is referred to at 3:80, and Kassapa, Gotama's predecessor, at 5:180. But there are a fair number of references to Tathāgatas in the plural, which indicates that the idea of a succession of Buddhas was already known to the compilers.

From the perspective of the Nikāyas, all the Tathāgatas partake of the same essential attributes that qualify them to serve as world teachers. The Tathāgata is declared to be "without a peer, without counterpart, incomparable, matchless, unrivaled,
unequaled, without equal, the foremost of bipeds" (1:174). He is the foremost of beings, and those who have confidence in him have confidence in the best (4:34). His arising is "the manifestation of great vision, light, and radiance" (1:175-77). He has fully awakened to "whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, and examined by the mind," and therefore whatever he teaches "is just so and not otherwise" (4:23). He is endowed with the "ten Tathāgata powers" and the "four kinds of self-confidence" on the basis of which "he claims the place of the chief bull, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the brahma wheel" (4:8, 10:22; see too 6:64). His "lion's roar" on impermanence is so powerful that it even causes the long-lived deities to quake and tremble (4:33).

# The Dhamma and the Discipline

Although the Buddha is the supreme person in the spiritual realm, he still revered something superior to himself: the Dhamma. After his enlightenment, seeking in vain for someone to honor, he decided: "Let me honor, respect, and dwell in dependence only on this Dhamma to which I have become fully enlightened" (4:22). When he teaches others, he does so "relying just on the Dhamma, honoring, respecting, and venerating the Dhamma, taking the Dhamma as his standard, bannner, and authority" (3:14, 5:133). Whomever he teaches, he teaches respectfully, "because the Tathāgata has respect for the Dhamma, reverence for the Dhamma" (5:99).

The Dhamma in this sense is not so much the verbally expressed doctrine as the corpus of spiritual principles that makes possible spiritual growth and liberation. Its ultimate referents are the noble eightfold path, the foremost of all conditioned phenomena, and nibbāna, the foremost of all things conditioned and unconditioned (4:34). The Buddha summed up the essence of the Dhamma in various ways that all flow out of the same body of principles. In one place, he says that the unlimited expressions of the Dhamma converge on four things: understanding what is unwholesome and abandoning it, and understanding what is wholesome and developing it (4:188). He taught Mahāpajāpatī, his foster mother, eight cri-
teria of the true Dhamma (8:53), and more concisely he told the bhikkhu Upāli that the teaching could be found in "those things that lead exclusively to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to nibbāna" (7:83).

Contrary to many of his contemporaries, the Buddha refused to indulge in speculative views about matters irrelevant to the quest for release from suffering. He particularly refused to make pronouncements about the fate of the liberated one after death or to answer the ten idle speculative questions (see 7:54). Instead, he stressed that he taught the Dhamma "for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and dejection, for the achievement of the method, for the realization of nibbāna" (9:20). Yet, though he maintained a kind of "metaphysical reticence," he did not hesitate to criticize those views he considered detrimental to the spiritual life. The texts sometimes mention three that he expressly repudiated: past-action determinism, deterministic theism, and denial of causality (3:61). He decidedly rejects as a wrong view the thesis that "there is no fruit or result of good and bad actions," which disavows the principle of kamma (10:176, 10:211, etc.). He also strongly criticized the "hard determinist" view that our decisions are irrevocably caused by factors and forces outside ourselves. Against the determinist position that "there is no kamma, no deed, no energy," he says that all the perfectly enlightened Buddhas teach "a doctrine of kamma, a doctrine of deeds, a doctrine of energy" (3:137). He insisted that there are such things as instigation, initiative, choice, and exertion, by reason of which people are responsible for their own destiny (6:38).

The Buddha claimed that his Dhamma was "directly visible" (sanditthika), a word that became one of its epithets. When questioned how this was to be confirmed, he explained in ways that directed the inquirers back to their own immediate experience. When a person is overwhelmed by lust, hatred, and delusion, he said, he acts for his own harm, the harm of others, and the harm of both, and he experiences suffering and dejection; but when lust, hatred, and delusion are abandoned, he is free to act for the well-being of all and no longer experiences suffering and grief (see 3:53-54). The destruction of lust, hatred, and
delusion is nibbāna, and in this respect nibbāna too is directly visible (3:55).

In AN, the Dhamma is viewed not merely as the path of practice and the goal of realization but also as the collection of verbal discourses that the Buddha gave during his teaching career. Thus the suttas occasionally refer to the nine types of teaching into which the discourses were classified in the earliest period, before they were compiled into Nikāyas (4:102, 4:107, 5:73-74, etc.). Because the Buddha's teachings, which disclose the path to enlightenment and liberation, were collected into a body of scriptures, the vigor, purity, and longevity of the Dhamma depend on the proper preservation and transmission of the texts. Among the four Nikāyas, AN is the one that insists most often on the need to properly preserve the Dhamma and thereby protect it from decay and disappearance.

Suttas that dwell on this theme are found throughout the work. A series of short texts in the Ones delineates the factors that cause the good Dhamma to vanish and, conversely, the factors that sustain its vitality (1:30-69). The latter can be summed up as not confusing what is the Dhamma with what is not the Dhamma; not confusing the discipline with what is contrary to the discipline; quoting the Buddha accurately, describing his conduct correctly, and not confounding different categories of disciplinary rules. In one sutta, the Buddha gives instructions to the monks on the criteria for determining whether teachings reported after his passing are authentic or spurious (4:180). Another sutta says that the good Dhamma degenerates when the monks do not preserve the teachings properly, misinterpret their meaning, fail to teach others, and backslide in the practice. But when, to the contrary, they preserve the teachings properly, interpret them correctly, teach others, and strive in the practice, the teaching lasts long (4:160).

# The Shifting Kaleidoscope of Experience

Given the importance of preserving the teaching and ensuring its longevity, what exactly is the content of the Dhamma that the Buddha discovered, and why is it so special? Before answering this question, it is useful to briefly review the Buddha's picture of the universe in order to see the background
setting for the quest for liberation. The Nikāyas envision a universe of inconceivably vast dimensions undergoing alternating phases of development and decline. The basic unit of cosmic time is the eon (kappa). Those who acquire the power of recalling their past lives, the texts say, can recollect "many eons of world-dissolution, many eons of world-evolution, many eons of world-dissolution and world-evolution" (3:58, 3:101, etc.). The.eon is divided into four phases: dissolving, prolonged dissolution, evolving, and completed evolution. Each of these is beyond calculation in hundreds of thousands of years (4:156). A world system has not only vast temporal duration but is also stratified by way of various realms of existence, ranging from the dismal hell realms, worlds of intense suffering, through the animal realm, to the sphere of afflicted spirits (sometimes called "hungry ghosts"); then on to the human realm, and upward through an ascending series of celestial realms inhabited by the devas and brahmās; the deities and divine beings. There are six sensual heavenly realms: the heaven of the four divine kings, the Tāvatimsa devas, the Yāma devas, the Tusita devas, the devas who delight in creation, and the devas who control what is created by others ( $3: 70,6: 10,8: 36$, etc.). Above these are the brahmā world and still higher realms, spheres of rebirth for those who have mastered the meditative attainments.

Despite their many differences, there is one thing that unites all sentient beings from the lowest to the highest: they all seek freedom from suffering and the achievement of true happiness. This inherent urge of a sentient being is precisely what the Buddha makes the commanding theme of his teaching, the linchpin holding all the doctrines and practices together. But rather than take our common assumptions for granted, the Buddha embarks on a critical inquiry into the question of what constitutes suffering and what offers the prospect for indissoluble happiness. Our preconceptions about what will make us happy are often deceptive, stemming from a fixation on immediate sensation that excludes recognition of the deeper repercussions and long-term consequences of our behavior.

Experience is ever changing, always shifting its shape without regard for our wishes and expectations. Despite our hopes, we cannot avoid old age, illness, and death, the decay of our possessions, the loss of those who are dear. The foolish worldling
and the wise disciple both share this fate. They differ in that the worldling does not reflect on the universality of this law, and therefore, when his fate catches up with him, "he sorrows, languishes, laments, weeps beating his breast, and becomes confused." The wise disciple, in contrast, realizes that old age, illness, and death, destruction and loss, are our universal destiny; he thus draws out "the poisonous dart of sorrow" and dwells happily, free of darts (5:48). Again, both worldling and disciple are subject to the "eight worldly conditions": gain and loss, disrepute and fame, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain. The worldling, attracted to one and repelled by the other, "is not freed from birth, from old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish." But the noble disciple, recognizing that all these unstable conditions are impermanent and subject to change, discards attraction and repulsion and achieves inner freedom (8:6).

What the Buddha emphasizes as a starting point in the quest for true happiness is the close correlation between the ethical quality of our conduct and the felt tone of our experience. Bodily deeds, speech, and thoughts can be distinguished ethically into two broad classes, the unwholesome (akusala) and the wholesome (kusala). The Buddha noted that the unwholesome is a source of misery, the wholesome a source of blessedness. Greed, hatred, and delusion lead to harm and suffering, while their removal brings well-being and happiness (3:6566). His constant injunction to his disciples, therefore, was to make a determined effort to abandon the unwholesome and to develop the wholesome (2:19). Wholesome endeavor brings a far greater, richer, and more enduring happiness than the indulgence of craving. A series of very short suttas contrasts different kinds of happiness and assesses their relative worth: the happiness of monastic life is superior to that of lay life; the happiness of renunciation superior to sensual happiness; the happiness without acquisitions superior to the happiness arisen from acquisitions; the happiness without taints superior to that with taints; and spiritual happiness superior to worldly happiness (2:64-68).

According to the Buddha, the "ever-shifting kaleidoscope" of suffering and happiness does not change its configurations only in a single life on earth; it changes even more radically as we
travel onward in the round of rebirths known as samsāra, "the wandering." The governing factor in this process, which makes the entire course of rebirth a lawful one, is a force called kamma (Skt: karma). The word kamma literally means "action," but the Buddha uses it to refer specifically to volitional or intentional action: "It is volition, bhikkhus, that I call kamma; for having willed, one acts by body, speech, or mind" (6:63 §5). Kamma thus denotes deeds that originate from volition, which may remain purely mental, creating kamma through our thoughts, plans, and desires; or it may come to expression in bodily and verbal deeds. Kamma also denotes the moral force created by our deeds. All our morally determinate deeds create a potential to bring forth results (vipāka) that correspond to their ethical quality. Our deeds generate kamma, and when suitable conditions come together, the kamma ripens and produces the appropriate fruits, bringing misery or happiness in dependence on the moral quality of the original action. The kamma we create may ripen in this very life, in the next rebirth, or on some subsequent occasion (3:34, 10:217). The one thing that is certain is that as long as we travel on in the cycle of rebirths, our stockpile of kamma is capable of ripening and yielding its due results. Thus the Buddha teaches, again and again, that "beings are the owners of their kamma, the heirs of their kamma; they have kamma as their origin, kamma as their relative, kamma as their resort; whatever kamma they do, good or bad, they are its heirs" (10:216; see too 5:57, 10:48).

The differences in kamma account for the wide diversity in the fortunes of people, who are constantly revolving in the cycle of existence, rising and falling, sometimes heading from darkness to light, sometimes from light to darkness (4:85). Kamma is the principal determinant of rebirth. Unwholesome kamma conduces to an unfortunate rebirth and painful results, wholesome kamma to a fortunate rebirth and pleasant results (2:16-17, 3:111, 10:217-18). Rebirth is not confined to the human realm, for kamma varies in its quality and potency and thus may produce rebirth in any of the five gatis or destinations: hell, the animal realm, the realm of afflicted spirits, the human world, or the deva world (6:63 §5). Beings are constantly migrating from realm to realm, but relatively few are reborn in the human or deva worlds compared to the much greater number who are
reborn in the hells, the animal realm, and the spirit realms, collectively called the plane of misery, the bad destinations, or the lower world (1:348-77). Modernists who propose interpreting these realms as psychological states that we experience in our human existence would have a hard time finding support for their position in the Nikāyas. In AN we read again and again, in almost every nipāta, of how beings are reborn in hell or in heaven "with the breakup of the body, after death" (käyassa bhedā parammarana). The expression is one of the main leitmotifs of the Nikāyas, and there are no indications that it is intended metaphorically.

The criterion for judging the volition responsible for an action to be unwholesome or wholesome is its accompanying motives or "roots." Three roots are unwholesome: greed, hatred, and delusion. From these such secondary defilements as anger, hostility, envy, miserliness, conceit, and arrogance arise, and from the roots and secondary defilements arise defiled actions with their potential to produce rebirth in the plane of misery (6:39). Wholesome kamma, on the other hand, is action that originates from the three wholesome roots: non-greed, non-hatred, and non-delusion, which may be expressed more positively as generosity, loving-kindness, and wisdom. Whereas actions springing from the unwholesome roots are necessarily tied to the round of repeated birth and death, actions born from the wholesome roots are of two kinds, mundane and world-transcending. Mundane wholesome actions have the potential to produce a fortunate rebirth in the higher realms (6:39). The world-transcending or supramundane (lokuttara) wholesome actions-namely, the kamma generated by practicing the noble eightfold path and the seven factors of enlightenment-dismantles the entire process of karmic causation and thereby leads to liberation from the round of rebirths (3:34, 4:233, 4:237-38).

The texts do not leave us guessing what kinds of deeds create wholesome and unwholesome kamma but provide precise maps over the terrain of right and wrong conduct. The standard list contains ten kinds of unwholesome action-three of body, four of speech, and three of mind-and ten corresponding types of wholesome kamma (10:167-233; see 10:176 for a detailed analysis). All these actions, however, ultimately spring from the mirid: Thus mind is revealed as the underlying source
of good and evil and, through the actions that flow from it, the fundamental cause of suffering and happiness.

By tracing the roots of suffering and happiness back to our intentions, the Buddha demonstrates that the key to happiness is the training and mastery of the mind. In a series of paired suttas, he says that he sees nothing that leads to such harm and suffering as the mind that is undeveloped, uncultivated, untamed, unguarded, unprotected, and unrestrained; while nothing leads to such great good and happiness as the mind that is developed, cultivated, tamed, guarded, protected, and restrained (1:23-40). Thus the core of the Buddha's teaching is the development and cultivation of the mind, which, as a result of such cultivation, will unfold its intrinsic luminosity and ultimately arrive at the bliss of liberation.

# Maintaining a Harmonious Household

Although early Buddhism prescribes a path of self-cultivation leading to the extinction of suffering, the Buddha realized that spiritual development does not occur in a social vacuum but rests upon a healthy and harmonious social order that exemplifies the kinds of virtues that nurture the spiritual life. Spiritual influences begin at the top of the social hierarchy and gradually spread downward, affecting the whole society and even the brological and physical domains (4:70). Thus the Buddha devotes considerable effort to instilling in his followers the lifestyle and sense of social responsibility that conduces to a harmonious society in which people act in accordance with the civic virtues. Among the four Nikāyas, the Anguttara-along with the Sigalaka Sutta (DN 31)-is probably the richest source of such teachings. John Kelly notes that this Nikāya has the largest number of suttas concerned with laypeople, either directly, by being addressed to them, or indirectly, by being spoken to the monks about the practices proper for a lay disciple. (See table 2.)

From the number of discourses on family relationships, it is evident that the Buddha regarded the family as the primary agent of acculturation. Since the head of the family has a particularly powerful impact on his household, the Buddha tried to promote the positive transformation of society by offering

Table 2. SUTTAS TO LAYPEOPLE BY NIKĀYA

(Source: Kelly 2011: 8)

householders guidelines to righteous living. He set up a pragmatic but inspiring ideal for the laity, that of the sappurisa or "good person," who lives "for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people," his parents, his wife and children, the domestic help, his friends, and contemplative renouncers (5:42). When the head of the family sets a good example, those who depend on him grow in all that is worthy: in faith, virtue, learning, generosity, and wisdom (3:48, 5:40).

In offering guidance to the family, the Buddha lays down the duties of children toward their parents (2:33, 3:31), advises husbands and wives how to live together (4:53), and even instructs a loving couple how they can be assured of reuniting in future lives (4:55). He distinguishes between wrong livelihood and right livelihood, defines the proper ways of acquiring and utilizing wealth, and prescribes the appropriate means for sustaining cordial relationships: giving, endearing speech, beneficent conduct, and impartiality (4:32). He not only instructed individuals and families, but he also advised states and rulers. He taught the people of the Vajji confederacy, who maintained a republican form of government, "seven principles of nondecline" (7:21). For kings he set up the ideal of the "wheelturning monarch" (rāja cakkavati), the righteous king who rules by the Dhamma and provides righteous protection for all in his realm, including the animals and the birds (3:14, 5:133).

# The Way Leading Upward

While early Buddhism sees a righteous society as providing the optimal conditions for collective well-being and happiness, its focus is not on social stability as such but on the spiritual development and liberation of the individual. The most congenial conditions for the unhindered pursuit of the final goal are provided by the lifestyle of a renunciant monk or nun, who is free from the constraints and liabilities of household life. But, almost unprecedented for his time, the Buddha also held that householders earning their living by "the sweat of their arms" and supporting a family could also advance spiritually and reach three of the four stages of awakening (see pp. 55-56 below). He thus laid down guideposts to spiritual cultivation for his lay followers that would be compatible with their time-consuming schedules of work and family responsibilities. These would enable the lay disciple to win a higher rebirth and even reach the plane of the noble ones, where final liberation is assured.

Many of the factors that enter into the foundational stage of spiritual development are common to the renunciant and the householder. Thus, though the suttas often describe these qualities in terms of a bhikkhu, they can be understood to pertain to lay disciples as well. The seed of spiritual development is a triad of qualities consisting of faith (saddhā), confidence (pasāda), and reverence (gārava). Faith is a faculty and a power, and as such is defined as belief in the enlightenment of the Buddha (5:2, 5:14). It is a deep trust in his wisdom and a readiness to comply with his advice. From faith arise the other four powers that inspire and direct the training: moral shame, moral dread, energy, and wisdom. Closely connected with faith is confidence, a feeling of serenity and mental clarity that arises from faith. The disciple has confidence that the Buddha is the best of beings, the Dhamma the best of teachings, and the Sangha of noble ones the best of spiritual communities (4:34). Along with faith and confidence comes reverence, a sense of respect and esteem directed toward the Three Jewels and the training (6:32-33).

For a disciple endowed with faith, spiritual growth is furthered by associating with good friends, people who can give guidance and serve as inspiring models. The Buddha's
statement to Ananda (SN 45:2) that good friendship is the whole of the spiritual life finds powerful analogues in AN. We read that there is "no single thing that so causes unarisen wholesome qualities to arise and arisen unwholesome qualities to decline as good friendship" (1:71). A pair of suttas beautifully enumerates the traits to be sought for in a good friend (7:36-37), and a discourse to a householder advises him to befriend other householders accomplished in faith; virtuous behavior, generosity, and wisdom ( $8: 54 \S 3$ ).

A large part of the practice for a householder involves engaging in meritorious deeds, activities that generate wholesome kamma conducive to a happy rebirth, good fortune, and spiritual progress. The Buddha even urges the bhikkhus, "Do not be afraid of merit," and he details the benefits he reaped in a previous life by cultivating a mind of loving-kindness (7:62). The texts enumerate three "bases of meritorious activity": giving, virtuous behavior, and meditative development (8:36). They also mention four "streams of merit" for a noble disciple: unwavering confidence in the Three Jewels together with virtuous behavior (4:52). The list is expanded to eight streams of merit by combining the Three Refuges with the five precepts (8:39).

Many short texts in AN are concerned with the etiquette of giving and generosity, with the emphasis on providing material support to monks and nuns as well as other ascetics who live in dependence on the lay community. Though the Buddha encouraged his disciples to support renunciants of all convictions, even his rivals ( $8: 12$ ), he also taught that the merit gained by giving is proportional to the spiritual qualities of the recipients, and thus the noble persons, especially arahants, serve as the most fertile field of merit (3:57). Virtuous behavior begins by observing the five training rules: abstinence from taking life, stealing, sexual misconduct, false speech, and use of intoxicants. The code of good conduct can be expanded into the ten courses of wholesome action, which cover not only bodily and verbal behavior but wholesome dispositions and correct views (10:176). A number of texts give specific directives on right speech. I already referred to right livelihood in the previous section.

Of particular value for the earnest lay devotee intent on merit
is the uposatha observance adopted on new-moon and full-moon days. On these occasions devout lay followers undertake eight precepts that emulate the precepts of a novice monk (3:70, 8:4145). They may spend the day practicing meditation, and one text recommends loving-kindness as especially suitable for the uposatha (9:18). Another text recommends five recollections, called means of cleansing the defiled mind (3:70). ${ }^{4}$ The Buddha explains that observing the uposatha complete in its eight factors is more beneficial than sovereignty over the continent, for the merit acquired can lead to rebirth in the heavenly worlds.

In an interesting table reproduced here, Kelly has calculated the prevailing aims across Nikāyas in the discourses addressed to laypeople. He distinguishes between aims concerned with mundane welfare-in this life and a heavenly rebirth-and those connected with the attainment of liberation: ${ }^{5}$.

Table 3. Goals for Laypeople per Nikaya

(Source: Kelly 2011: 19)

Kelly notes that AN has a much stronger emphasis than the other Nikāyas on the two mundane goals as against the attainment of stream-entry or higher stages on the path. However, even in AN the practice for a lay follower is not exhausted by merit. In several suttas the Buddha mentions four qualities that lead to the superior welfare of a lay follower. The first three are faith, virtue, and generosity, the constituents of merit. But the fourth is wisdom, specifically "the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering" (8:54, 8:76). This is the
wisdom of insight into impermanence, which leads beyond all spheres of rebirth to the final goal of the Dhamma; the realization of nibbāna and release from the round of rebirths.

# Dispelling the World's Enchantment

To steer his disciples away from their attachment to transient objects of clinging, the Buddha employs an arsenal of techniques intended to uncover the abyss that lies just beneath the apparently innocent joys of a virtuous life. These techniques are intended to instill in the aspirant a quality called samvega, a word without a precise English equivalent. To convey the sense it is necessary to resort to a makeshift phrase like "a sense of urgency." Samvega might be described as the inner commotion or shock we experience when we are jolted out of our usual complacency by a stark encounter with truths whose full gravity we normally refuse to face. Samvega arises from the recognition that our self-assumed security is illusory, that we are perpetually treading on thin ice, which at any moment may crack beneath our feet.

The chief catalyst in inducing this sense of urgency is our confrontation with our inevitable mortality as revealed by old age, illness, and death. This encounter shakes us out of our habituation to mundane comforts and sets us in quest of unshakable peace and freedom. The future Buddha himself had to undergo this "shock of recognition" before he could embark on his own quest for enlightenment. His deep reflections on old age, illness, and death shattered his infatuation with youth, health, and vitality and drove him from his palace out into the forest seeking the unaging, illness-free, and deathless nibbāna (3:39).

In many suttas, the Buddha employs a template involving three standpoints designed to induce the sense of urgency. These three standpoints are gratification (assäda), danger (ädīnava), and escape (nissarana). ${ }^{6}$ We begin with what is immediately obvious: that our experience in the world provides some degree of gratification or enjoyment, which consists in the pleasure and joy that arise with the fulfillment of our desires. It is because people experience gratification that they become attached to the things that give them pleasure. When, however, we look more deeply, we can see that just beneath the glittering surface of joy there is a
dark underbelly of pain and distress. This is their danger, stemming from their impermanence (anicca), liability to suffering (dukkha), and nature to change and decay (vipariñamadhamma). The third step, escape, shows us the release from danger. When we see that our craving for pleasure binds us to what is inherently flawed, we can drop the craving. Thus the escape lies in "the removal and abandoning of desire and lust."

It is for the purpose of provoking a sense of urgency that the Buddha stresses aspects of experience that we typically try to conceal from ourselves. These points of emphasis give the teaching a "pessimistic" flavor, but it is a pessimism that does not lead to the blind alley of nihilism but to the open fields of liberation, the end of suffering. In accordance with this strategy, the Buddha teaches his disciples, whether monastics or laypeople, to often reflect on the fact that they are subject to old age, illness, and death; that they must be parted from everyone and everything they love; and that they are the heirs of their own kamma (5:57). He underscores the misery in sensual pleasures, calling them perilous, suffering, a disease, a boil, a tie, and a swamp (6:23; see too 8:56). He declares that even a trifling amount of conditioned existence, "even for a mere finger snap," is like a lump of feces (1:328). He calls attention to the foulness of the body, which contains thirty-one unattractive constituents, is prey to a host of diseases, and resembles a boil with nine orifices (10:60 §§3-4; 9:15). He stresses the transience of human life, which is short, limited, and fleeting, beset by suffering and misery (7:74). He points out that at some point in the future even this great earth with its mighty mountains will burn up and vanish (7:66). Even more, he says, the entire world system will dissolve along with its powerful deities. Understanding this, the wise disciple "becomes disenchanted and dispassionate toward the foremost, not to speak of what is inferior" (10:29 §§2-3).

# The Defilements of the Mind

Once we clearly recognize the defects in sensual pleasures and the futility of meandering from life to life in the realms of conditioned existence, the urge arises to break free from bondage and reach the end of repeated becoming, which is also the end
of suffering. To fulfill this urge, we have to investigate the cause of our bondage, for it is only by removing the cause that we can eliminate the result. The Buddha locates the cause of suffering in the bonds of our own minds. Hence the stress in the teaching on honest self-assessment (10:51). As part of a diagnosis of the origin of suffering, the Nikāyas are replete with catalogues of the various defilements to which the mind is prey. In AN we find many such groups, which are usually given metaphorical names to indicate how they affect us: taints, hindrances, floods, fetters, and so forth.

When reading the Nikāyas, we are likely to be awed by the wide range of the defilements that are listed, and also to be confused about the distinctive roles played by the different groupings. To make sense of these lists, I have sorted them into three categories. The categories are of my own devising and are not mentioned as such either in the canonical texts or the commentaries. However, though the groups should not be thought of as rigidly exclusive, the classification seems to stand up to examination.

(1) The first class are the defilements responsible for flawed behavior. These are the underlying motives of misconduct and unwholesome kamma. The most important of such groups are the three unwholesome roots: greed (or lust), hatred, and delusion, referred to above in the discussion of kamma. They are often mentioned as the causes of bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct, and they are also explicitly aligned with the ten courses of unwholesome action (10:174). The three roots are sometimes expanded to "four wrong courses" (4:17-20)-desire, hatred, delusion, and fear-when motives for biased decisions are taken up for consideration.

Sexual desire is a defilement of crucial concern to monastics, who are committed to a life of celibacy and thus need to curb and master their sexual urges. The Buddha often speaks about the dangers in sensual pleasures and cautions the monks about forming close bonds with members of the opposite sex (5:225-26). In a monastic community that brings together people with sharply differing personalities and strong opinions, anger and resentment can also have a corrosive effect on group dynamics, and thus the Buddha and his chief disciples prescribe methods to dispel these disruptive emotions (5:161-62; 9:29-30;

10:79-80). Anger and hostility jointly form the first of six "roots of dispute," which the Buddha saw as a danger to the harmony of the Sangha (6:36). Since monastics are in principle taught to share their gains-whether material things, lay supporters, or knowledge-the Buddha enumerated five kinds of miserliness that must be uprooted to ensure that everyone in the community gets to fulfill their potential (5:115, 5:224). Laypeople, too, are instructed to dwell at home "with a mind devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in relinquishment, devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing" (6:10).

(2) The second class of defilements in this threefold scheme are those that impede the success of meditation. The most elementary in this group is the simplest: sheer laziness, resistance to the work of "arousing energy for the attainment of the as-yetunattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized" (8:80). Once a meditator overcomes laziness and makes the endeavor to meditate, the defilements he or she is likely to encounter fall into a set known as the five hindrances, so called because they are "obstructions, hindrances, encumbrances of the mind, states that weaken wisdom." They even prevent one from knowing one's own good and the good of others (5:51). The Buddha condemns them as "a complete heap of the unwholesome" (5:52) and compares them to corruptions of gold (5:23) and impurities in a bowl of water (5:193). A series of suttas at the beginning of AN explains the principal triggers for each of the five hindrances and the most effective contemplative techniques for subduing them (1:11-20).

The Anguttara mentions other sets of defilements that obstruct meditation practice. These include the three kinds of unwholesome thoughts (4:11), the five kinds of mental barrenness (5:205), and the five mental bondages (5:206). These can more or less be correlated with the five hindrances. All these defilements are overcome, tentatively, through the successful practice of serenity meditation, which reaches fulfillment in samädhi, mental collectedness or concentration.

(3) The defilements of the third type are the deepest and the most obstinate. These are the defilements lodged at the base of the stream of consciousness that maintain bondage to the cycle of
rebirths. Such defilements lie dormant in the mind even when the meditator achieves exalted states of concentration. They can be removed only by the development of wisdom, by insight that penetrates deep into the truth of the Dhamma. In the language of the Pāli commentaries, they are totally eradicated only by the "supramundane" or world-transcending paths (lokuttaramagga), states of consciousness that break through the barriers of conditioned reality and penetrate the unconditioned nibbāna.

The most primordial of these fundamental defilements are called the āsavas, inadequately translated as "taints." These consist of craving for sensual pleasures, craving for continued existence, and ignorance (6:63 §4). They are fully eradicated only with the attainment of arahantship, and thus the fruit of arahantship is described as "the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom achieved with the destruction of the taints." Other groups of fundamental defilements include the four bonds (4:10), identical in content with the three āsavas but augmented by the bond of views; the seven underlying tendencies (7:1112); and the ten fetters, whose eradication in clusters marks the attainment of the successive stages of awakening (10:13). The three unwholesome roots-lust, hatred, and delusion-also operate at this level and thus must be uprooted to gain liberation. All these defilements fall under the dominion of ignorance and craving for existence, which drive the process of samsāra forward from one existence to the next (3:76-77). Final liberation therefore ultimately depends on eliminating ignorance and craving, which occurs through the world-transcendent wisdom that deeply discerns the four noble truths.

# The Path of Renunciation

Although the Buddha taught the Dhamma openly and broadly to both renunciants and laypeople, he gave special attention to those who followed him from the household life into homelessness to pursue the goal that he himself had realized. Thus the full range of Dhamma practice is incorporated into the systematic training of the bhikkhu or bhikkhunī. The graduated course of monastic training is treated in greatest detail in the Digha and Majjhima Nikāyas, but the same sequence also appears once in AN (4:198).

The precondition for the training is the arising of the Tathāgata and his proclamation of the Dhamma. Having heard the teaching, the student acquires faith and goes forth into the homeless life. Now a bhikkhu, he undertakes the ethical discipline of a renunciant, which requires a life of harmlessness and purity in bodily and verbal action. He should be content with the simplest requisites, yet without priding himself on his austerity (4:28). To facilitate the passage to concentration, he practices restraint of the sense faculties and exercises mindfulness and clear comprehension in all activities. Other texts on the monastic training mention two other measures that fit into this phase: moderation in eating and wakefulness (3:16, 4:37). The bhikkhu resorts to a secluded dwelling place, cleanses his mind of the five hindrances, and masters the four jhānas, the stages of deep concentration. He then directs the concentrated mind toward the three kinds of higher knowledge: the recollection of past lives, perception of the passing away and rebirth of beings, and the penetration of the four noble truths. This process reaches consummation in the liberation of the mind from the āsavas.

Another sutta, 10:99, begins with the same series of preparatory steps, but from the attainment of the four jhānas it proceeds to the four formless meditative attainments: the base of the infinity of space, the base of the infinity of consciousness, the base of nothingness, and the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. From there the meditator continues to the "cessation of perception and feeling"-also known as the attainment of cessation-on emerging from which he "sees with wisdom" and attains the destruction of the àsavas. In this version of the training, the first two higher knowledges are not mentioned, and the process of mental development is continued through all nine meditative attainments. Yet, despite this difference, both conclude with the destruction of the āsavas.

Though AN shares this comprehensive description of the monastic training with other Nikāyas, it includes formulations that seem to be specific, if not entirely unique, to itself. One such is the threefold training: the higher virtuous behavior, the higher mind (of concentration), and the higher wisdom (3:8190). Of particular interest in this series of texts is a pair of suttas stating that a monk can fall into offenses regarding the lesser and minor training rules, undergo rehabilitation; and attain the
four stages of awakening (3:86-87). What he upholds firmly are "those training rules that are fundamental to the spiritual life, in conformity with the spiritual life." These two suttas also correlate the threefold training with the four stages of awakening: the stream-enterer and once-returner fulfill virtuous behavior but not the other two trainings, the non-returner fulfills virtue and concentration but not wisdom, and the arahant fulfills all three trainings.

Another perspective on the sequential course of practice is offered by a series of "expanded parallels" that begins in the Fives (with 5:24) and continues with augmentation into later nipatas as far as the Elevens. This series can be stratified in terms of the threefold training and its culmination in liberation, but it exhibits the finer transitional stages that lie between the main stages. Thus in the most complete version (11:3), it proceeds from virtuous behavior to non-regret, thence in steps to joy, rapture, tranquility, pleasure, concentration, knowledge and vision of things as they really are, disenchantment, dispassion, and the knowledge and vision of liberation. Presumably, liberation itself should be wedged in after dispassion, but this would require a Book of Twelves.

The monastic quest does not always culminate in the nirvanic realization that inspired the monk to embark on the life of renunciation. The Nikāyas show a keen awareness of human weakness and thus ring precautionary alarms. One sutta mentions four "perils" that face a clansman who has "gone forth out of faith from the household life into homelessness": anger at being instructed by younger monks, craving for food that is frustrated by the regulations governing meals, attraction to the five kinds of sensual pleasure, and the encounter with seductive women (4:122). Another discourse says that any bhikkhu or bhikkhuni who gives up the training and reverts to lay life does so because of insufficient faith, moral shame, moral dread, energy, and wisdom (5:5). And two long discourses compare the bhikkhu who is deflected from the training to a warrior defeated in battle. In one case the cause is "a woman or a girl who is beautiful, attractive, graceful, possessing supreme beauty of complexion" (5:75). In the other it is the passion that arises from seeing women on alms round "with their dress in disarray and loosely attired" (5:76). The Anguttara shows that while
the Buddha had deep trust in the capacity of human beings to triumph over all bonds and fetters, he was not oblivious to the difficulty of the endeavor or to the strength and cunning of the defilements that have to be confronted and vanquished.

# Meditation

The heart of the monastic life is the practice of what we call meditation, the methodical effort to tame and master the mind and to develop its capacity for calm and insight. The training begins with the undeveloped mind, clouded and unruly, beset by passions and defilements. It ends in the liberated mind, tranquil, tamed, bright and luminous, freed from defilements and bondage to repeated existence.

Methods of mental cultivation fall into two categories, serenity (samatha) and insight (vipassana); the former is considered the means to develop concentration, the latter the means to develop wisdom. Serenity brings the tentative abandoning of lust and results in liberation of mind. Insight brings the abandoning of ignorance and results in liberation by wisdom (2:31). Jointly, "liberation of mind" and "liberation by wisdom" constitute arahantship, the final goal.

Although the usual sequence of meditative training proceeds from concentration to wisdom, several suttas in AN show that meditators can choose various routes to reach the worldtranscending path. The disciple Ānanda states that all those who attain arahantship do so in one of four ways: either by developing serenity first and then insight (the standard sequence), by developing insight first and then serenity, by developing the two in conjunction, and by emerging from "restlessness about the Dhamma" and achieving a unified mind (4:170). Another sutta advises one who gains either serenity or insight (but not the other) to seek out a teacher who can give instructions on obtaining the missing factor; one who gains neither should seek instructions on gaining both; while one who gains both should develop them to capacity to reach the destruction of the asavas (4:94).

The subjects of meditation mentioned in AN are many and diverse. Like the other Nikāyas, AN does not give detailed instructions on the technology of meditation, but it introduces
a wide variety of meditation subjects. Apparently these had to be diverse to accommodate the different dispositions of the people who came to the Buddha for instruction. The Book of the Ones includes a virtual "catalogue" of themes and attainments pertaining to meditation practice, all set forth in connection with what makes a bhikkhu worthy to receive almsfood (1:394-575). The same nipāta concludes with an extended paean to mindfulness of the body (1:575-627), declared to be the key to realizing the deathless.

Suttas in AN describe many of the familiar meditation subjects that receive more detailed treatment in such works as the Visuddhimagga. We find here mindfulness of breathing (10:60 §10), the six devotional recollections (6:10, 6:25), loving-kindness (8:1, 11:15) along with all four immeasurables or "divine abodes" (3:65, 8:63), and mindfulness of death (6:19-20, 8:73-74). Walking meditation is praised for bringing five benefits (5:29). Of particular interest is the emphasis AN places on the "perceptions" (sa $\bar{n} \bar{n} \bar{a}$ ), meditation subjects that initially involve a fair amount of reflection rather than bare mindful observation. AN 7:49, for instance, mentions seven perceptions, which are said to "culminate in the deathless, to have the deathless as their consummation." The seven are the perception of unattractiveness, the perception of death, the perception of the repulsiveness of food, the perception of non-delight in the entire world, the perception of impermanence, the perception of suffering in the impermanent, and the perception of non-self in what is suffering. Each of these perceptions is then connected to a specific distorted perception or inclination that it counteracts. Thus the perception of unattractiveness eliminates desire for sexual intercourse, the perception of death counters attachment to life, the perception of the repulsiveness of food causes the mind to shrink away from craving for tastes. The popular Girimānanda Sutta describes ten perceptions, which the Buddha instructs Ānanda to recite in order to restore the health of the bhikkhu Girimānanda, who was afflicted with a grave illness (10:60).

Some of the meditation subjects mentioned in AN pertain, in traditional Theravāda exegesis, to the development of serenity, others to the development of insight. What is interesting in AN, however, is that while serenity and insight are treated as distinct domains of meditation with their own points of
emphasis and fruits, a hard and fast line is not drawn between meditation subjects as pertaining to the one or the other. It is quite conceivable that in the Buddha's own view of meditation, serenity and insight represent not two separate categories of meditation objects but two complementary subjective orientations that can be developed on the basis of the same set of meditation objects.

In AN the higher states of consciousness achieved through meditation are often mentioned. The most frequent, of course, are the four jhānas. In addition we also come across such sets as the eight bases of overcoming (8:65), the eight emancipations (8:66), and the nine progressive abidings (9:31-61). Success in meditation is sometimes shown to culminate in the three true knowledges, the tevijja (3:58-59), which the Buddha himself attained on the night of his enlightenment (8:11). Elsewhere meditation brings attainment of the six kinds of superior knowledge later known as the abhin $\bar{n} \bar{a} s$ (3:101-2, 5:23, 6:2). Five of these involve psychic powers, while the sixth is the worldtranscending knowledge of the destruction of the $\bar{a} s a v a s$.

# WISDOM

When pursued as an end in itself, deep concentration is accompanied by exalted joy, bliss, calm, and equanimity. These experiences can convince the unwary meditator that he has reached the final goal and discovered "the nirvanic peace within." Such lofty states, however, are achieved simply through the intensification of consciousness, not through the deep insight that cuts off the bonds of repeated existence. The superior states of concentration generate powerful wholesome kamma, which can lead to rebirth in the form or formless realm-the realms of super-divine stature-depending on the attainments reached during the meditator's human existence. Without the deep discernment of wisdom, this kamma will eventually be exhausted, and the divine being will pass away and take rebirth elsewhere, perhaps even in the bad destinations (3:116, 4:123-26). For the path to reach completion and culminate in the deathless, it must eventually bring forth wisdom. Thus the Buddha praises wisdom as the foremost splendor, radiance, light, luster, and luminary (4:141-45).

Despite the analogy with light, however, wisdom does not flare up suddenly and spontaneously through pious good wishes; rather, it is gradually begotten by following a prescribed course of training. One sutta enumerates eight conditions for acquiring and maturing the wisdom that pertains to the spiritual life (8:2). These include relying on a teacher, asking questions to clear away one's doubts, observing the rules of discipline, learning and reflection, and contemplating the arising and vanishing of the five aggregates. Another supporting factor for the growth of wisdom is right view. The Buddha assigned right view to the first place among the factors of the noble eightfold path and the ten kinds of rightness (10:103). From right view originate the other nine factors, ending in right knowledge and right liberation (10:105).

Learning and investigating the Dhamma also contribute to the growth of wisdom. Among the four Nikāyas, it is perhaps AN that places the greatest emphasis on learning. Learning is described as one of the five kinds of wealth (5:47) and as a quality that makes a bhikkhu respected and esteemed by his fellow monks (5:87). Of course, a disciple who has learned just a little but puts what he or she has learned into practice is superior to one who learns much without applying it (4:6). But learning does possess intrinsic value, and those who excel in learning and also obtain the four jhānas and the three true knowledges are regarded as especially worthy of respect (10:97). Mastery over the Dhamma qualifies one to teach, so that one can not only expedite one's own progress but also promote the good of others (8:62).

The suttas of AN do not merely praise learning but provide concrete instructions on how to learn and teach the Dhamma. Since the Dhamma was always conveyed orally, not in written documents, the texts emphasize the need for both attentive listening and retention. One who does not attend closely is like an inverted bowl, which cannot hold water; one who attends but does not retain what has been learned is like a man who upsets the contents of his lap; while the one who both attends to discourses and retains what has been learned preserves it for a long time, just as an upright bowl long retains water (3:30). Ānanda, the most learned of the bhikkhus, mentions six factors conducive to mastery of the Dhamma, among them learning
many discourses, teaching others, and visiting elders to clear up points one does not fully understand (6:51).

Listening to the Dhamma can serve as an occasion for entering the irreversible path to final liberation, but to gain this benefit one has to listen properly. This means that one has to listen with a respectful and open mind, not with a mind intent on finding faults and disparaging the discourse and the speaker (5:151-53). Listening and teaching can even precipitate the attainment of liberation. While listening to the Dhamma, teaching it, reciting it, or examining its meaning, one may gain inspiration, experience joy, and set in motion a process that ends in full liberation from the āsavas (5:28): Learning, however, should be accompanied by practice. Thus the Buddha urges the monks not to spend all their time on study, teaching, recitation, and reflection but to go apart and devote themselves to the development of internal serenity and experiential wisdom (5:73-74).

Learning and teaching play a vital role in ensuring the longevity of the Dhamma. The Dhamma declines and disappears, says one sutta, when the bhikkhus do not respectfully listen to it, learn it, retain it in mind, examine the meaning, and put it into practice; it continues without degeneration when the bhikkhus are devoted to learning, reflection, and practice (5:154). Other suttas stress the importance of teaching and making others recite the texts (5:155). When teaching, one has to select the appropriate topic, assessing the interests and expectations of the audience, and then give a talk that matches their inclinations (5:157). The Buddha prescribes five guidelines for a teacher of the Dhamma: he should give a talk that follows a progressive sequence; he should provide reasons to support his assertions; he should have empathy with his audience; he should not be intent on material gain; and he should not say anything harmful to himself or others (5:159).

Penetrative wisdom is not a matter of merely mastering a body of texts or a system of ideas but of seeing into the true nature of phenomena. The principles to be seen with wisdom are the "three characteristics" of impermanence, suffering, and non-self. We are told that whether Tathāgatas àrise in the world or not, this fixed law remains: that all conditioned phenomena are impermanent; that all conditioned phenomena are suffering; and that all phenomena whatsoever are non-self (3:136).

To see the true nature of phenomena thus means to see them as impermanent, suffering, and non-self. Normally, our minds are subject to perceptual and conceptual distortion, so that we construe things as being permanent, pleasurable, and self. However obvious these notions seem to us, the texts describe them as an inversion of perception and as forms of cognitive derangement (4:49). The task of insight is to correct this distortion by contemplating things "as they really are," that is, as impermanent, suffering, and non-self (7:16-18). Interestingly, several suttas in AN add a fourth theme of contemplation: contemplating nibbāna as happiness (6:101, 7:19).

Contemplation of conditioned phenomena as impermanent and suffering, contemplation of all phenomena as nonself, and contemplation of nibbāna as happiness enable the disciple to acquire "a conviction in conformity" with the Dhamma (anulomikā khantī). This prepares the mind for still deeper insight, and when that insight becomes aligned with the Dhamma itself, it induces entry upon "the fixed course of rightness" (sammattaniyäma), the world-transcending path that leads unfailingly to the four stages of awakening (6:98-101).

The Buddha insisted that the ultimate goal of his teaching was the extinction of suffering in this very life, and for this reason he constantly urged the bhikkhus not to remain satisfied with any partial achievement but to press on toward the final goal. He enjoined them to resolve: "I will not relax my energy so long as I have not attained what can be attained by manly strength, energy, and exertion" (2:5). Two suttas in AN give us an inside glimpse of the contemplative process by which the disciple realizes the final goal. One discourse explains that a bhikkhu enters any of the four jhānas or lower three formless attainments and contemplates its constituents-the five aggregates comprised in the attainment (four aggregates in the formless attainments)-as impermanent, suffering, an illness, a boil, a dart, misery, affliction, alien, disintegrating, empty, and non-self. At a certain point he turns his mind away from those phenomena and directs it to the deathless element, nibbāna. On this basis he attains either the destruction of the āsavas, that is, arahantship, or if he cannot complete the work, the stage of non-returner (9:36). The other sutta is spoken by Ānanda to a lay devotee who has asked how a bhikkhu reaches the destruc-
tion of the taints. Ananda explains that the bhikkhu enters any of the four jhānas, the four immeasurables (loving-kindness, compassion, altruistic joy, and equanimity), or the three lower formless attainments. He then reviews the attainment as "constructed and produced by volition," and observes: "Whatever is constructed and produced by volition is impermanent, subject to cessation." In this case, too, he attains either arahantship or non-returning (11:16).

According to traditional exegesis, the word sangha is used in two senses: as a designation for the monastic order consisting of bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, sometimes called the "institutional Sangha" or "conventional Sangha" (sammutisangha), and as a designation for the "community of noble ones" (ariyasangha), which consists of the eight types of noble persons, the four pairs of those who have attained the world-transcending paths and fruits. On the basis of this distinction it is then said that the conventional Sangha consists only of monastics, whether noble ones or ordinary people, while the noble Sangha is said to include laypeople who have attained the paths and fruits as well as monastics. In AN a distinction between these two kinds of Sangha is discernible, but the boundaries between them are not as clear-cut as tradition makes them out to be. First, whenever new converts to the Dhamma declare that they go for refuge, they state the third object of refuge to be the "Sangha of bhikkhus" (presumably also including bhikkhunis). This shows that they (or, more likely, the compilers of the texts) understood the monastic community to be the third refuge. Second, the formula for the noble Sangha describes it in terms that apply more readily to renunciants than to householders: it is "worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation." Such an encomium again establishes a connection between the monastic Sangha and the noble Sangha.

However, one sutta speaks of "four kinds of persons who adorn the Sangha." These are well-disciplined and learned bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, male lay followers, and female lay followers (4:7; see too 4:211). This suggests that the word sangha
even in the conventional sense can include laypeople, unless one understands the statement to mean that bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs adorn the Sangha as its members while laypeople adorn it as its supporters. In any case, almost everywhere else when the texts speak about the Sangha without specific reference to the noble ones, the monastic order (or subgroups within it) is intended.

Several AN suttas show that the monastic Sangha did not always measure up to the criteria the Buddha had set for it. In 2:42-51 a series of contrasts is drawn between pairs of assemblies, one censurable, the other laudable. The two assemblies are specifically described in terms of bhikkhus. The censurable arm of each pair includes the shallow assembly, in which the bhikkhus are "restless, puffed up, and vain"; the inferior assembly, in which they are luxurious and lax; the dregs of an assembly, in which they enter a wrong course on account of desire, hatred, delusion, or fear; and the assembly that values worldly things, not the good Dhamma. Heedlessness and worldliness were not the only problems that the Buddha had to deal with in the monastic order. Scattered throughout AN are references to quarrels and disputes among the bhikkhus. Thus we read about situations when the bhikkhus had taken to "arguing and quarreling and fell into a dispute, stabbing each other with piercing words" (10:50; see too 2:43, 3:124). On some occasions the threat of schism cast its shadow. To forestall this danger, the Buddha proposed six guidelines to promote cordial relationships among the bhikkhus (6:12), and he urged them to assemble often and conduct the affairs of the Sangha in harmony (7:23). He also cautioned them about six roots of disputes that had to be extirpated whenever they arose (6:36). Yet despite the faults of its members, the Buddha had high regard for the monastic Sangha. He praised the Sangha of diligent bhikkhus as an unsurpassed field of merit worth traveling many miles to see (4:190), and he was pleased when he saw monks living "in concord, harmoniously, without disputes, blending like milk and water, viewing each other with eyes of affection" (10:50).

The monastic Sangha not only provided optimal conditions for those intent on leading the spiritual life in full earnestness, but it also served as a field of blessings and a channel for spreading the Buddha's teachings to the lay community.

Bhikkhus and bhikkhunis offered laypeople the opportunity to gain merit by supporting them with robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicine. The monastics also used their encounters with laypeople as opportunities to teach the Dhamma to the people in the homes, villages, and towns that they visited. Hence the Buddha laid strong emphasis on the need for both partners in this symbiotic relationship to fulfill their respective duties. The monastics are obliged to provide an inspiring model of disciplined conduct to the laity, behaving in such a way that "those without confidence gain confidence and those with confidence increase in their confidence" (8:54; see too 4:245 §1). The lay community is responsible for seeing to the material needs of the monastics. In doing so, they are expected to act with proper etiquette, saluting the monastic disciples respectfully, offering them a seat, giving generously, and showing solicitude for their well-being (7:13). The lay devotees should also sit close by to listen to the Dhamma and savor the flavor of the words (9:17).

The noble Sangha consists of eight types of noble persons, who are joined into four pairs in relation to the four stages of awakening. The two members of each pair are the one who has attained the stage itself and the one who has entered the path leading irreversibly toward that stage. They are stated concisely thus: "The stream-enterer, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of stream-entry; the once-returner, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of once-returning; the non-returner, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of non-returning; the arahant, the one practicing for realization of the fruit of arahantship" (8:59). In one sutta another term is added to the list of eight, the gotrabh $\bar{u}$ or "clan member" (9:10; see too 10:16). Strangely, the relationship of this figure to the others is not explained in the Nikāyas. The commentaries interpret this term through the lens of the later Theravādin exegetical system, according to which gotrabh $\bar{u}$ refers to the single mindmoment that makes the transition from the peak of insight to the world-transcending path. But this explanation presupposes the development of technical schemes not discernible in the Nikāyas, and it is therefore unlikely to represent the term's original meaning.

The four main stages are distinguished by the fetters that they eliminate and the number of rebirths that remain for those
who attain them (see 3:86, 4:210). With the destruction of the three lower fetters (see 10:13), the disciple becomes a streamenterer (sotāpanna), no longer subject to rebirth in the three lower realms and bound to reach liberation in a maximum of seven more lives, passed either in the human realm or in the deva world. With the destruction of three fetters and the additional diminishing of greed, hatred, and delusion, one becomes a once-returner (sakadāg $\bar{a} m \bar{\imath}$ ), who comes back to this world one more time and then makes an end of suffering. With the destruction of all five lower fetters, the disciple becomes a nonreturner (anägamī), who takes spontaneous rebirth in the form realm (usually in a special region called the pure abodes) and attains final nibbāna there without returning from that world. And with the complete destruction of the taints; the disciple becomes an'arahant, a fully liberated one. ${ }^{8}$

Though the explanations in the texts are often phrased in terms of bhikkhus, laypeople are also able to attain the first three fruits and even the fourth. In the last case; however, tradition says that they either attain arahantship on the verge of death or almost at once leave the household life for homelessness. We find in AN the testimony of several lay non-returners. Thus the laywoman Nandamātā insinuates that she is a nonreturner (at 7:53), as do Ugga of Vesālī and Ugga of Hatthigāma (at 8:21 and 8:22, respectively). The Sixes (6:119-39) mention a large number of male lay followers who have "reached certainty about the Tathāgata and become seers of the deathless," a phrase that implies that they are noble disciples (but not arahants). Many female lay followers are elsewhere confirmed as winners of the noble fruits.

Another method of distinguishing the noble ones into seven types is mentioned at 7:14, where they are simply listed without explanation; explanations are found in MN 70. The seven are the one liberated in both respects, the one liberated by wisdom, the body witness, the one attained to view, the one liberated by faith, the Dhamma follower, and the faith follower. The first two are arahants, who are distinguished in that the former can also attain the "peaceful formless emancipations" (the formless meditations and the attainment of cessation) while the latter cannot. The middle three are types of sekhas, disciples in higher training, who are distinguished according to their
dominant faculty. The first excels in concentration, the second in wisdom, the third in faith. As 3:21 points out, these three cannot be ranked against one another in terms of superiority, since each can comprise anyone ranging from a stream-enterer to a person on the path to arahantship. The Dhamma follower and the faith follower are two types who have entered the path to stream-entry but have not yet attained the fruit. They are distinguished respectively by whether their dominant faculty is wisdom or faith. At the end of 7:56, the Buddha mentions another "seventh person" in place of the faith follower. This type is called "one who dwells in the markless" (animittavihārt), a term unexplained in the sutta itself and never taken up for elaboration in the post-canonical Buddhist tradition. The commentary simply identifies this figure with the faith follower, but that may be an attempt to fit unusual ideas into the slots of an established system.

The ideal spiritual figure of AN, as of the Nikāyas as a whole, is the arahant, who is called "the best among devas and humans: one who has reached the ultimate conclusion, won ultimate security from bondage, lived the ultimate spiritual life, and gained the ultimate consummation" (3:143, 11:10). The arahants "have destroyed the taints, lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached their own goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, and are completely liberated through final knowledge" (6:49, 9:7). They are "devoid of lust through the destruction of lust; devoid of hatred through the destruction of hatred; devoid of delusion through the destruction of delusion" (6:55). They are no longer subject to return to any realm of existence, whether sense-sphere existence, form sphere existence, or formless-sphere existence (9:25). They enter and dwell in the taintless liberation of mind, the liberation by wisdom, and on their passing away attain final nibbāna.

Though all arahants are alike in their eradication of all defilements and their liberation from samsāra, AN introduces an interesting distinction between two kinds of arahants. One, the "white-lotus ascetic" (pundarikasamana), does not attain the eight emancipations, while the other, the "red-lotus ascetic" (padumasamana), does so. The commentary interprets the first type as one who attains none of the eight emancipations, and thus as a dry-insight arahant (sukkhavipassaka), who attains
arahantship without attainment of the jhānas. This figure is not explicitly found in the Nikāyas, and thus questions may be raised whether the commentary is not reading into the text an idea arisen from a later period. An interpretation that accords better with such suttas as MN 70 would regard the white-lotus ascetic as the arahant "liberated by wisdom". (paññāvimutta), who can attain the four jhānas but not the formless emancipations, while the red-lotus ascetic would be the arahant "liberated in both respects" (ubhatobhāgavimutta). In addition to the jhānas and the formless emancipations, some arahants attain the "three true knowledges": knowledge of past lives, knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings, and knowledge of the destruction of the āsavas (3:58). Still others attain six superior knowledges, which include, in addition to the three just mentioned, the psychic powers, the divine ear, and the knowledge of the minds of others (6:2).

# Types of Persons

The Anguttara is distinguished among the four Nikāyas by its interest in defining and describing types of persons. These classifications are not proposed from the standpoint of objective psychological analysis but in order to relate different types of persons to the values and goals of the Dhamma. Most, but not all, of the distinctions are drawn among monastics and are put forward as pairs or groups with three or more types.

We thus find distinctions drawn between such personality types as the fool and the wise person, the bad person and the good person, the blameworthy monk and the esteemed monk. This last pair is sometimes painted in finer detail by describing more fully the characteristics of the monk who is incorrigibly evil and the monk held up as an exemplar. Similar distinctions are drawn between laypersons, so that we have laypeople of bad intent and those who serve as examples for the lay community.

One distinction drawn among persons should dispel a misconception about early Buddhism that in recent years has receded but may not be completely extinct: namely, that in its stress on personal responsibility it was narrowly individualistic. In later times, this misconception (which might have been fostered by
attitudes that prevailed in certain sections of the Sangha) led to the designation Hinayana, or "Little Vehicle," being ascribed to the schools that adhered to the ancient scriptures. A series of suttas, 4:95-99, distinguishes persons into four types ranked by way of ascending excellence: (1) one who is practicing neither for his own welfare nor for the welfare of others; (2) one who is practicing for the welfare of others but not for his own welfare; (3) one who is practicing for his own welfare but not for the welfare of others; and (4) one who is practicing both for his own welfare and for the welfare of others. The text not only rates the fourth as best but commends it in superlatives as "the foremost, the best, the preeminent, the supreme, and the finest of these four persons." Another series of suttas, 5:17-20, explains how a bhikkhu can practice for his own welfare and the welfare of others. And still another sutta broadens the altruistic motivation further, concluding that a person of great wisdom "thinks only of his own welfare, the welfare of others, the welfare of both, and the welfare of the whole world" (4:186).

# BhikKHunis and Women in the Anguttara Nikaya

Although most of the suttas in AN are addressed to bhikkhus and describe their subjects as such, they occasionally feature bhikkhunis, fully ordained nuns, as their protagonists or subjects. We find in AN the story of the origins of the Bhikkhuni Sangha (8:51) as preserved also in the Cūlavagga of the Vinaya. The story is controversial: first, because of the Buddha's initial reluctance to allow women to enter the homeless life; and second, because, after giving them permission to go forth, he declares that the ordination of women will have a corrosive effect on the teaching, shortening its life span from a thousand years to five hundred years. Whether such an account is historically trustworthy has been questioned by modern-day scholars, for it contains anachronisms hard to reconcile with other chronological information in the canon and commentaries. But the sutta has been responsible for a distrustful attitude toward bhikkhunis in Theravāda countries and may explain why conservative elders have resisted the revival of the Bhikkhuni Sangha currently taking place in such countries as Sri Lanka and Thailand.

AN includes, in the sequence on foremost disciples, a section on outstanding bhikkhunīs. But whereas the section on bhikkhus consists of four vaggas containing forty-seven categories (several occupied by the same person), that on bhikkhunīs contains only one vagga with thirteen names. Perhaps this was because the number of bhikkhunīs was much smaller than the number of bhikkhus, but it may also reflect the biases of the age and perhaps attitudes that prevailed in the school that preserved the Pāli Canon. It seems that the Ekottarāgama of the Chinese Tripitaka, stemming from another early school, includes many more bhikkhunīs among the eminent disciples.

At 7:56 the Buddha reports that two deities informed him that a number of bhikkhunīs have been "well liberated without residue remaining." In 8:53, he explains to the bhikkhunī Mahāpajāpati Gotamī the eight qualities distinctive of the proper Dhamma and discipline. In 10:28 a "bhikkhunī from Kajañgalā" responds to ten numerical questions. When her answers are related to the Buddha, he says: "The bhikkhunī of Kajañgalā is wise, of great wisdom. If you had asked me about this matter, I would have answered exactly as she has done."

But it is not only in favorable terms that AN speaks about bhikkhunīs. A series of six suttas, 5:115-20, explains various causes for bhikkhunīs to be reborn in hell. She is miserly, she criticizes and praises others indiscriminately, she squanders gifts given out of faith, she is envious, holds wrong views, speaks and acts wrongly, and so on. It is puzzling that the text should single out bhikkhunīs for such stern remarks, but perhaps they were seen as necessary precautions. In any case, at 5:236-40 the same statements are made about bhikkhus.

Among the four Nikāyas, AN has the largest number of suttas addressed to women, ${ }^{9}$ but a small number of discourses in the collection testify to a misogynistic attitude that strikes us as discordant, distasteful, and simply unjustified. These texts depict women as driven by powerful passions that impair their abilities and undermine their morals. At 2:61, the Buddha declares that women are never satiated in two things: sexual intercourse and giving birth. When Ānanda asks why women do not sit on councils, engage in business, or travel to distant regions, the Buddha answers that this is because they are full of anger, envious, miserly, and devoid of wisdom (4:80). Two
suttas compare women to a black snake (5:229-30) in that they are "wrathful, hostile, of deadly venom, double-tongued, and betray friends." Their venom is their strong lust, their double tongue is their proclivity to slander, and they betray friends in that "for the most part women are adulterous." In 5:55 we read about a mother and son who were ordained as bhikkhunī and bhikkhu. They continued to keep close company, fell in love, and indulged in sexual relations with one another. When this was reported to the Buddha, he is shown laying the blame on women: "If one could rightly say of anything that it is entirely a snare of Māra, it is precisely of women that one might say this."

Whether these statements should really be attributed to the Buddha or regarded as interpolations by monastic editors is a question that may not be possible to settle with complete certainty. Such statements, however, are surely contrary to the more liberal spirit displayed elsewhere in the Nikāyas. Moreover, in a text like AN, with its many short suttas, it would have been relatively easy for monks, apprehensive about their own sexuality or the spiritual potentials of women, to insert such passages into the canon. These suttas do not have counterparts in the Chinese Āgamas, but that fact on its own is inconclusive; for many suttas in the Pāli Anguttara Nikāya are without counterparts in the Chinese canon. Other suttas in AN that deal with sexuality show a more symmetrical approach, such as 1:1-10, 7:51, and 8:17-18, where the sexual attractions of men toward women and of women toward men are precisely balanced.

Quite in contrast to the suttas with a misogynistic tone are others that show the Buddha acting cordially toward women and generously bestowing his teaching upon them. He teaches the lay devotee Visākhā how the uposatha observance can be of great fruit and benefit (3:70, 8:43). He teaches Suppavāsā the merits of giving food (4:57). He explains to Queen Mallikā, the wife of King Pasenadi, the karmic causes through which women can achieve beauty, wealth, and influence (4:197). He answers the questions of the princess Cundī on the best kinds of confidence and virtuous behavior (5:32). He instructs a group of girls about to be married on how to behave when they go to live with their husbands (5:33), and he instructs a boisterous wife about the seven kinds of wives (7:63). He explains
to Visākhā how a woman is heading to victory both in this world and the next (8:49). He extols the bhikkhunīs Khemā and Uppalavaṇṇā as models for his bhikkhunī followers and the female lay devotees Khujjuttarā and Velukaṇṭakī Nandamātā as models for his female lay disciples (4:176). It is hard to reconcile such texts, which display a friendly and empathetic attitude toward women, with the passages that categorically denigrate their capacities.

# The Repetition Series

Each of the nipātas from the Twos to the Elevens concludes with a "Lust and So Forth Repetition Series" (rāgädipeyyāla). ${ }^{10}$ This is created by establishing permutations among three sequences of terms. One is a list of seventeen defilements: lust, hatred, delusion, anger, hostility, denigration, insolence, envy, miserliness, deceitfulness, craftiness, obstinacy, vehemence, conceit, arrogance, intoxication, and heedlessness. The second is a series of ten terms showing the tasks that are to be fulfilled in relation to these seventeen defilements: direct knowledge, full understanding, utter destruction, abandoning, destruction, vanishing, fading away, cessation, giving up, and relinquishment. The first iwo are complementary cognitive operations; the other eight are synonyms for eradication by world-transcending wisdom. Taken in combination, we obtain an initial total of 170 operations.

The third sequence of terms consists of sets of practices that fall under the numerical rubric of the nipāta. These may be as few as one or as many as five. Each set of practices is applied to each of the 170 operations, generating a sutta for each possibility. The Twos and Threes each have only one set of practices: the pair of serenity and insight in the Twos and the three kinds of concentration in the Threes. Thus in each of these two nipatas only 170 suttas are generated. But the Fours have three practice sets: the four establishments of mindfulness, the four right strivings, and the four bases of psychic potency. So this nipata generates 510 suttas. The Fives have five practice sets, which generates the maximum number of repetition suttas: 850. Several nipāias have three sets, generating 510 suttas each. On account of the repetition series, the number of suttas in AN
more than doubles beyond the number constituted by the independent suttas.

# Other Formal Features of the Anguttara Nikaya

Apart from the "Lust and So Forth Repetition Series," AN exhibits a number of other formal features that deserve brief comment. One is what I call "expanded parallels." An expanded parallel is a sutta that is modeled on an earlier sutta and includes its contents (or most of its contents) but then introduces another item that elevates it to a higher nipāta. I mention these in the notes, but it is useful to look at them collectively. To assist with this, I have included a list of expanded parallels as appendix 1 . Most expanded parallels extend over only two nipatas, which may follow in immediate succession or be more widely separated. The most extensive expanded parallelism in AN is a series of terms on the successive steps culminating in "the knowledge and vision of liberation." It occurs in six nipatas. The sequence first appears in 5:24, and then reappears, enlarged by the addition of factors, in 6:50, 7:65, 8:81, 10:3, and 11:3. The next fullest set of expanded parallels is a group of perceptions said to "culminate in the deathless" that occurs four times. This set first appears in 5:61 and reappears in 7:48, 9:16, and 10:56. In the third most prominent set, the bhikkhu Kimbila asks the Buddha why the Dhamma does not endure long after the passing away of a Tathāgata. The set occurs three times, at 5:201, 6:40, and 7:59. The others that I have discovered all extend only over two nipatas. Their topics range from reverence for mother and father, to the ways an evil monk resembles a master thief, to the special samädhi that a bhikkhu enters to perceive nibbāna.

A second formal feature is what I call "composite numerical suttas." These are discourses that acquire the number of items characteristic of a particular nipata by combining smaller sets of terms. These composites are listed in appendix 2. For example, a series of suttas at 6:105-16 arrives at six items by combining sets of three defilements with three counteractive measures per sutta. Another sutta, 7:58, falls into the Sevens by combining four things that the Tathāgata need not hide with three ways he is irreproachable. At 8:49, the Buddha teaches Visakhā four ways a woman is heading for victory in this world
and four ways she is heading for victory in the next world. In 9:3, he explains to his attendant Meghiya five things that mature the mind for liberation and then teaches him four meditation subjects: Occasionally multiple sets are combined. Thus 11:10 enumerates three groups of three qualities, and one pair of qualities, that make a bhikkhu "best among devas and humans." In this way the sutta fits into the Elevens.

The number of suttas in AN is increased by several techniques that amplify the amount of material without adding much significantly new to the content. Some suttas share a common mold and multiply themselves by using a few. nearly synonymous terms to make the same point. An example is 3:6-8, which describe the distinction between the fool and the wise person simply by using different descriptive words. An alternative method of establishing a variation is to use a different image to convey the point. Thus 3:51 and 3:52 are virtually identical in content, but one uses the image of a flood sweeping over the world, the other the image of a fire. Toward the end of the Threes, seven suttas, 3:156-62, are created from the same mold simply by changing the group of "aids to enlightenment" taken to represent the middle way. In some suttas the subject remains the same but the content used to define the subject differs. An example is 4:201-6, where the subject is constant, namely, the bad person and the good person, but the qualities that pertain to each type differ from one sutta to the next.

Another recurrent formal technique in AN is to include in close proximity two or more suttas on the same topic, the first simply enunciating a set of factors and the second giving formal definitions of them. Examples of this are fairly numerous. Thus 4:161 enumerates the four modes of practice without explanation, while 4:162-63 elaborate on them. Sutta 4:232 enumerates the four kinds of kamma, while 4:233-38 define them and explore them from several angles. Suttas 5:1-2 provide back-toback enumerations and definitions of the five trainee's powers; 5:13-14 do the same for the five powers; 7:3-4 treat seven powers in this way; and 7:5-6 declare and define the seven kinds of noble wealth. Again, 8:5-6 applies this treatment to the eight worldly conditions, and 10:19-20 do the same for the ten abodes of the noble ones. Occasionally a large gap separates the brief and the detailed treatment; for instance, 6:9 enumerates the six
things unsurpassed, but their elaboration comes only at 6:30. This raises the question how such gaps could have entered, but it is difficult to give a cogent explanation.

Still another interesting feature of AN (noticeable, too, in the Samyutta Nikāya) is the use of what I call "auditor-setting variants." With this technique, a discourse having the exact same content is given to several people. Thus in 8:25 and 8:26 the Buddha answers the same questions on the qualities of a lay disciple raised respectively by Mahānāma and Jīvaka. In 8:43 and 8:45 he gives the same discourse on the uposatha to Visākhā and Bojjhā, and in 8:91-117 (much abridged) to twenty-seven other women, if we are to trust the commentary. Often the Buddha will deliver a discourse to an individual and then, in another sutta, say the same thing to the monks. Thus in 4:53 he speaks about different kinds of marriage to a group of householders and then teaches the same thing to the monks in 4:54. He teaches Anāthapindika how a noble disciple might declare himself a stream-enterer in 8:28 and in 8:29 repeats the same explanation to the monks.

There is variation not only in the auditor but in the speaker. One of the monks, usually Sāriputta, gives a discourse that repeats exactly what the Buddha said earlier. We see examples of this in 5:163-64, which mirror 5:65-66; in 8:77-78, which mirror 8:61-62; and in 10:4 and 10:5, where Sāriputta and Ānanda give the same discourse that the Buddha gave in 10:3. It is a puzzle why such suttas were included in the Nikāya when there is no difference in their contents from those given by the Buddha himself.

There are several instances of two suttas that appear to be "expanded parallels" but in which the content is so different that the parallelism is dubious. Moreover, the framework of these paired suttas is such that it is virtually impossible for both to have been historically authentic. Thus the Buddha gives discomses on the visible benefits of giving to the general Sina at 5:34 and 7:57. Yet the content differs so much that one may well doubt that the Buddha really spoke both to Sina. The case is even stronger with regard to 6:44 and 10:75, where on two different occasions a laywoman named Migasālā makes the same complaint about statements the Buddha issued concerning the rebirth of her father and her uncle. The Buddha's responses to
the criticism differ prominently on each occasion, and it thus seems improbable that both are reproducing actual statements made within the same narrative framework.

In the Tens, we meet two large blocks of text that state the same thing across forty or fifty suttas, using two different doctrinal lists to provide content. In 10:113-66 the subject is the tenfold rightness, and in 10:167-210 it is the ten courses of unwholesome and wholesome kamma. The number of short suttas in AN is increased still more by the use of permutations to generate a large number of texts from a few simple doctrinal sets. I explained above how this was done in the "Lust and So Forth Repetition Series." A similar process is used in 7:95-622 to generate 520 suttas by combining modes of contemplation with different objects. Again, at the end of the Elevens, 960 suttas are created by a similar process of combination and permutation.

# The Anguttara Nikāya Commentary

To assist the reader in understanding the suttas, I have provided a copious set of notes. The notes serve at least four purposes: (1) to provide background information to the sutta; (2) to explain obscure words or phrases in the original; (3) to bring out the doctrinal implications of a statement; (4) and to make explicit the reading I have adopted among competing alternatives. As noted above, my translation relies on the Sri Lankan, Burmese, and PTS editions of AN, which occasionally differ in their readings. I have used the Sri Lankan Buddha Jayanti edition as my primary text, but I sometimes prefer readings from one of the other versions or from a manuscript referred to in the notes to these edititins. For the benefit of those with access to the Pāli text, I feel obliged to state which reading I have chosen, to record plausible variants, and sometimes to explain why I made the choice I did over and against the alternatives.

In the notes (as in this introduction) references to AN suttas have been set in bold. When a textual source is followed by volume, page, and (sometimes) line numbers, these refer to the PTS editions. Manytef the notes are drawn from the authorized Pāli commentary on AN, the Anguttara Nikāya-atṭhakatha, also known by its properiname, the Manorathapurani ( Mp ), "The Fulfiller of Wishes." Tars is ascribed to the great Buddhist commen-
tator Ācariya Buddhaghosa, who came from South India to Sri Lanka in the fifth century C.E. and compiled the commentaries to the canonical texts on the basis of the ancient Sinhala commentaries (no longer extant) that had been kept at the Mahāvihāra in Anurādhapura. Buddhaghosa occasionally refers to the "Great Commentary" (Mahā Atthakathā) as the source of his own commentary. In the colophon to the Manorathapūranī he says that he completed it "by taking the essence of the Great Commentary" (sā hi mahāatṭhakathāya sāramādāya niṭthitā esā). Whereas the canonical texts had been preserved in Pāli, the Great Commentary had been transmitted in the old Sinhala language, intelligible only to the residents of the island (and perhaps by Buddhaghosa's time only to the most erudite among them). Buddhaghosa translated this material into lucid and elegant Pāli, thereby making it accessible to the bhikkhus in India and perhaps in the outlying regions to which Buddhism had spread. In his colophon to the work, Buddhaghosa explains why he gave his commentary its title, using the word Āgamas instead of the more familiar Nikāyas to designate the four main sutta collections:

Because this work fulfilled my wish to comment on all the Āgamas,

it has been given the name "The Fulfiller of Wishes." ${ }^{11}$

The other exegetical work to which I occasionally refer is the subcommentary, the Anguttara Nikāya-tikā, also known as the Manorathapūranī-tik $\bar{a}$ (Mp-t) and under its proper name, the Sāratthamañjūsā IV-tikā, "The Casket of the Essential Meaning, Part IV." This subcommentary does not belong to the set of "old subcommentaries" (purānatikā), known as the Līnatthappakäsinī and ascribed to Ācariya Dhammapāla, the (seventh-century?) South Indian author of the subcommentaries to the other three Nikāyas. ${ }^{12}$ It is ascribed, rather, to the great Sri Lankan elder Sāriputta, who worked during the reign of King Parakramabāhu I (1153-86) at the capital Polonnaruwa. Since the sutta and commentary are usually sufficiently clear on their own, I have not had to refer to the $t i k a \bar{a}$ as often as I did to the Samyutta Nikāyapurānatikā in my notes to the Connected Discourses of the Buddha. Words in bold in Pāli citations from the commentary and $t \bar{i} k \bar{a}$ represent the lemma, the word or phrase being commented upon.

I should state, as a precaution, that as useful as they are, the commentaries explain the suttas as they were understood sometime around the first century C.E., when the old commentaries drawn upon by Buddhaghosa were closed to further additions. The commentaries view the suttas through the lens of the complex exegetical method that had evolved within the Theravāda school, built up from the interpretations of the ancient teachers and welded to a framework constructed largely from the principles of the Abhidhamma system. This exegetical method does not necessarily correspond to the way the teachings were understood in the earliest period of Buddhist history, but it seems likely that its nucleus goes back to the first generation of monks who had gathered around the Buddha and were entrusted with the task of giving detailed systematic explanations of his discourses. The fact that I cite the commentaries so often in the notes does not necessarily mean that I always agree with them, though where I interpret a passage differently I generally say so.

I want to briefly mention two tenets, central to the commentarial method, that seem to be in tension with the texts themselves. Both must have emerged when the early teachings were being recast into the more rigorous and analytically precise system that underlies the Theravada Abhidhamma. The stages by which the doctrinal evolution from suttas to Abhidhamma occurred, and the specific maneuvers involved, are still barely understood in detail and thus constitute a wide-open field for scholarly investigation.

The first tenet distinctive of the commentaries concerns the meaning of the terms path and fruit. In the Abhidhamma, the four stages of awakening are regarded as temporal events, each consisting of two phases joined in immediate succession. First comes a single mind-moment known as the path (magga), which is followed at once by its corresponding fruition (phala). Thus there are the paths of stream-entry, once-returning, nonreturning, and arahantship, each followed in immediate succession respectively by the fruit of stream-entry and so forth. The path is sometimes called the "world-transcending path" (lokuttaramagga), to distinguish it from the preliminary or preparatory practice (pubbabhägapatipadā), the course of training leading up to the world-transcending path. The commentaries
take up this scheme from the Abhidhamma and apply it as a tool of exegesis, reading it back into the early suttas as if it had already been intended by the original texts. I mentioned above (pp. 55-56) that in the Nikāyas, the noble Sangha is said to consist of eight types of noble persons, who are joined into four pairs in relation to the four stages of awakening: the person practicing for realization of a particular fruit and the person who has attained that fruit. The commentaries identify the person practicing for the attainment with the path-attainer of the Abhidhamma, and the one who has attained the corresponding fruit with the one who has undergone the fruition experience.

In the Nikāyas, no such tenet is discernible, at least not in this form. The Nikāyas call the crucial awakening experience the "breakthrough to the Dhamma" (dhammäbhisamaya) or the "gaining of the Dhamma eye" (dhammacakkhupatiläbha). The experience appears to be sudden, but it is not identified with the path as such nor is it said to last only a single mind-moment. Several suttas suggest, to the contrary, that the path is a temporally extended course of practice that becomes irreversible when the disciple enters "the fixed course of rightness" (okkanto sammattaniyämam). At that point the practitioner transcends the level of a worldling or ordinary person (puthujjana) and becomes either a Dhamma follower (dhammānusārī) or a faith follower (saddhānusārī). While reaching the path guarantees realization of the fruit, the fruit does not necessarily arise a moment after entering the path. All that the texts say is that those who have entered the fixed course of rightness cannot pass away without realizing the fruit of stream-entry (see SN 25:1; III 224). This implies that further practice, perhaps over days or weeks, may be needed to realize the fruit.

Once the path has arisen, the practitioner then "pursues this path, develops it, and cultivates it," as a result of which "the fetters are abandoned and the underlying tendencies are uprooted" (4:170). These expressions suggest that the path is an extended process of cultivation rather than an instantaneous event. Though the course of practice will be punctuated by sudden breakthrough attainments, the word "path" itself refers to the whole process of development rather than a momentary event, and the fruit seems to be simply the attainment of the relevant stage of awakening, not a special contemplative experience.

Further support in AN for the extended nature of the path is at 8:22. Here the householder Ugga declares that when he is serving the Sangha with a meal, though deities inform him of the monks' spiritual attainments, he still serves them equally, without being biased on the basis of their spiritual status. Among those who receive his offerings are faith followers and Dhamma followers. If these persons existed as such only for the duration of a momentary breakthrough experience, it is hard to see how they could be spoken of as recipients of a meal offering. It certainly takes more than one mind-moment to receive and eat a meal.

The second point over which some degree of tension surfaces between the Nikāyas and the commentaries concerns the question whether rebirth occurs immediately after death or after an interval of time. During the age of Sectarian Buddhism, when different schools branched off from the originally unified Sangha and doctrinal differences began to emerge, the Pāli school adopted the tenet that rebirth occurs in the very moment following death, with no interval separating the moments of death and rebirth (or reconception). It seems that this position, articulated in the commentaries, is based on a particular reading of certain passages in the final book of the Abhidhamma Pitaka, the Patthāna. Yet there are suttas that can be read as contradicting this doctrinal position.

The Anguttara offers one of the strongest counterweights against the hypothesis of instantaneous rebirth. The Nikāyas often analyze the person at the third stage of realization, the anägämi or non-returner, into five subtypes. The first among them, the one with the sharpest faculties, is called antarāparinibbāyī, which I render "an attainer of nibbāna in the interval." The commentaries explain this figure as one who attains nibbāna in the first half of the life span; they then go on to interpret the other four types in a way that accords with this explanation. However, 7:55 distinguishes three subtypes of antarāparinibbāyī, each of which it illustrates with a simile. The similes-of a blazing metal chip going out at different points before hitting the ground-suggest that the antarāparinibbāyī attains nibbāna before taking rebirth, thus supporting the hypothesis of an intermediate stage separating death and rebirth, at least for certain non-returners (but surely capable of a broader
generalization). This was the position advocated by some of the rival schools with which the Theravāda competed on Indian soil, most notably the Sarvāstivādins.

Similes are not always a reliable basis for drawing doctrinal conclusions, and the question whether rebirth is instantaneous or follows an interval seems to have minimal practical importance. But a commitment to instantaneous rebirth is fundamental to the Theravāda commentaries. The tone of certain arguments in the commentaries suggests that among the early Indian Buddhist schools, the issue generated a degree of heat that hardly seems warranted by its practical bearings. Perhaps underlying the conflict was apprehension that acknowledgment of an intermediate state could be taken to imply a self or soul that migrates from life to life. But other schools felt comfortable enough, accepting the intermediate state without seeing it as threatening the doctrine of non-self.

# The Chinese Parallels

In my notes I have also occasionally compared the Pāli versions of suttas in AN with their parallels preserved in Chinese translation, primarily in the Chinese Agamas and occasionally in independent translations. I mentioned above (p. 17) that there is a counterpart to AN that had been translated into Chinese, the Ekottarāgama or Ekottarikāgama. It would be a mistake, however, to suppose that the Pāli Anguttara Nikāya and the Ekottarāgama are close parallels.

While the four Pāli Nikāyas all belonged to one school, known today as the Theravāda, the four Āgamas in Chinese translation derived from several schools that arose during the period of Sectarian Buddhism, none identical with the progenitor of the Theravāda. The Dirghāgama (counterpart of the Dīgha Nikāya) was translated from a version belonging to the Dharmaguptaka school, which flourished in Gandhāra. The Madhyamagama (counterpart of the Majjhima Nikāya) is believed to have descended from a branch of the Sarvāstivāda. According to Enomoto, its affiliation was most likely with the Kashmirian Sarvāstivādins. ${ }^{13}$ Enomoto finds reasons for ascribing the Chinese Samyuktāgama (counterpart of the Samyutta Nikāya) to the Mūlasarvästivadins, who had their headquarters
in Mathurā. ${ }^{14}$ The school affiliation of the Ekottarāgama is problematic. Anesaki wrote over a century ago that "there are strong reasons to believe that the version was made from a text handed down by a school which had a very different tradition from the Theravāda, possibly by one of the Mahāsāmghika sections."15 Its affiliation with the Mahāsāmghikas became a widespread supposition, often stated as a matter of fact. However, more recently, Enomoto writes that questions concerning the school, place of formation, and language of the original text of this work "have yet to be solved."16

Because the Āgamas descend from different schools, the arrangement of their contents differs. While the different schools all apparently distributed their suttas into four main collections with the same names, they made different choices in their allocation of the material. Thus the parallels of many shorter suttas that the Pāli tradition assigned to AN are to be found, in the Chinese Āgamas, in the Samyuktāgama (for example, the parallels of 3:81-90 all occur in SĀ, the parallel of 4:111 is SĀ 923, the parallel of 5:167 is SĀ 497, etc.). Often the parallels of longer AN suttas occur in the Chinese Madhyamāgama (for example, 6:43 occurs as MĀ 118, 7:55 as MĀ 6, 10:51 as MĀ 110, etc.). Since the school affiliations were different, it is not unusual for an AN sutta to have two or more parallels in the $\bar{A}$ gamias, as well as one or more independent translations. To take but one example, 6:55, the Buddha's advice to the bhikkhu Sona, occurs as MĀ 123, SĀ 254, EĀ 23.3, and as two independent translations. There are also many AN suttas that are without Āgama parallels.

Comparisons between the Pāli and Āgama versions proved helpful in a number of respects. Sometimes a simpler Chinese translation helped to clarify the intention of a phrase that seemed unnecessarily convoluted in Pāli. For example, the plea that somebody makes to the Buddha when he wants to avoid misrepresenting him (see 3:57) is so complex that it even misled the commentator into giving an implausible explanation. The Chinese treatment of the same phrase (see p. 1646, note 416) supports the simpler explanation borne out by another occurrence of the Pāli expression in a different context at 5:5. Sometimes, when there was a discrepancy between readings of a Pāli expression, the Chinese version, by agreeing with one as
against the other, supported its claim to antiquity. For example, a verse in 4:40 describes the Buddhas as yañãassa koviḍ̂, "skilled in sacrifice," in the Be version, but in the Ce and Ee versions the phrase is read puñãassa koviḍ̂, "skilled in merit." Two Chinese parallels render the phrase in a way that indicates its translators were working from an original that said the Buddhas were skilled in sacrifice, thereby supporting Be. Again, there is a verse spoken by the bhikkhu Udāyī in 6:43 in which all three printed editions of AN read the third line as sañkhäresūpasantesu, meaning "when all conditioned things have become still," but a Burmese variant (referred to in the notes of Be and Ee) and the version in the Theragāthā read it as añgāresu ca santesu, meaning "when the coals have gone out." The Chinese parallel, though not exactly identical, still supports the Burmese variant against the three printed editions of AN (see p. 1758, note 1326).

Another interesting example is at 10:26 (see p. 1838, note 2000) where in Ce and Ee we find a triad ādi, ādīnava, nissarana instead of the usual assāda, ādīnava, nissarana. The editors of Be obviously assumed an error had occurred here and replaced ādi with assāda. But the Chinese parallel has 本, which corresponds to ādi, not to assāda, and thereby confirms the antiquity of the Ce and Ee reading. A sutta near the end of the Tens, 10:219, "The Deed-Born Body," contains no set of ten items to explain its inclusion in the Tens, but the text uses a demonstrative pronoun to refer to a subject who was not previously introduced; so it seems as if a passage had been elided in the course of transmission. The Chinese parallel, MA 15 , begins with the Buddha enumerating the ten types of unwholesome kamma. It then asserts that a noble disciple discards those ten kinds of kamma, and following this comes a passage referring to that disciple with a demonstrative pronoun. Thus this version shows that a passage with ten items had in fact been elided from the AN sutta.

An intriguing divergence between the two traditions occurs in a discourse widely known as the Kālāma Sutta, which records the Buddha's advice to the people of Kesaputta. In contemporary Buddhist circles it has become almost de rigueur to regard the Kālāma Sūtta as the essential Buddhist text, almost equal in importance to the discourse on the four noble truths. The sutta is held up as proof that the Buddha anticipated Western empiricism, free inquiry, and the scientific method, that he endorsed
the personal determination of truth. Though until the late nineteenth century this sutta was just one small hill in the mountain range of the Nikāyas, since the start of the twentieth century it has become one of the most commonly quoted Buddhist texts, offered as the key to convince those with modernist leanings that the Buddha was their forerunner. However, the Chinese parallel to the Kālāma Sutta, MĀ 16 (at T I 438b13-439c22), is quite different. Here the Buddha does not ask the Kālāmas to resolve their doubts by judging matters for themselves. Instead, he advises them not to give rise to doubt and perplexity and he tells them point blank: "You yourselves do not have pure wisdom with which to know whether there is an afterlife or not. You yourselves do not have pure wisdom to know which deeds are transgressions and which are not transgressions." He then explains to them the three unwholesome roots of kamma, how they lead to moral transgressions, and the ten courses of wholesome kamma.

In other instances, the Pāli and Chinese versions of a sutta offer such different perspectives one can only conclude that the original in one tradition was inverted, but we cannot say for sure which one underwent inversion. A case in point is 2:36, in which Sāriputta speaks about "the person fettered internally" and "the person fettered externally." In the Pāli version Sāriputta explains the former as "a returner, one who returns to this state of being" (that is, to the sense sphere) and the latter as "a non-returner, one who does not return to this state of being." But the Chinese parallel inverts this explanation: "The person with an internal fetter is the non-returner, who does not come back to this world. And the person with an external fetter is one who is not a non-returner but who comes back to this world." In a case like this it is virtually impossible to mediate between the two versions, and there is little to fall back on to support one reading as against the other.

# The Book of the Twos

## Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One

## I. Entering UPON THE RAINS

## 1 (1) Faults

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, there are these two faults. What two? The fault pertaining to the present life and the fault pertaining to the future life.

"And what is the fault pertaining to the present life? Here, someone sees that when kings arrest a robber, a criminal, they subject him to various punishments: they have him flogged with whips, beaten with canes, beaten with clubs; they have his hands cut off, his feet cut off, his hands and feet cut off; his ears cut off, his nose cut off, his ears and nose cut off; they have him subjected to the 'porridge pot,' to the 'polished-shell shave,' to the 'Rāhu's mouth,' to the 'fiery wreath,' to the 'flaming hand,' to the 'blades of grass,' [48] to the 'bark dress,' to the 'antelope,' to the 'meat hooks,' to the 'coins,' to the 'lye pickling,' to the 'pivoting pin,' to the 'rolled-up palliasse'; and they have him splashed with boiling oil, and they have him devoured by dogs, and they have him impaled alive on stakes, and they have his head cut off with a sword. ${ }^{216}$

"It occurs to him: 'When kings have arrested a robber, a criminal, they subject him to various punishments because of his bad deeds: they have him flogged with whips... they have his
head cut off with a sword. Now if I were to commit such a bad deed, and if kings were to arrest me, they would subject me to the same punishments. They would have me flogged with whips... they would have my head cut off with a sword.' Afraid of the fault pertaining to the present life, he does not plunder the belongings of others. ${ }^{217}$ This is called the fault pertaining to the present life.

"And what is the fault pertaining to the future life? Here, someone reflects thus: 'Bodily misconduct has a bad, painful result ${ }^{218}$ in the future life; verbal misconduct has a bad, painful result in the future life; mental misconduct has a bad, painful result in the future life. Now if I were to engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind, then, with the breakup of the body, after death, I would be reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell!' [49] Afraid of the fault pertaining to the future life, he abandons bodily misconduct and develops bodily good conduct; he abandons verbal misconduct and develops verbal good conduct; he abandons mental misconduct and develops mental good conduct; he maintains himself in purity. This is called the fault pertaining to the future life.

"These, bhikkhus, are the two faults. Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will fear the fault pertaining to the present life; we will fear the fault pertaining to the future life. We will be fearful of faults and see peril in faults.' It is in such a way that you should train yourselves. It is to be expected that one who is fearful of faults and sees peril in faults will be freed from all faults."

# 2 (2) Striving

"Bhikkhus, there are these two strivings that are hard to achieve in the world. What two? The striving of laypeople who dwell at home for the purpose of presenting [monastics with] robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick, and the striving of those who have gone forth from the household life into homelessness for the relinquishment of all acquisitions. These are the two strivings that are hard to achieve in the world.

"Of these two strivings, bhikkhus, the foremost is the striving for the relinquishment of all acquisitions. ${ }^{219}$ Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will strive for the
relinquishment of all acquisitions.' It is in such a way that you should train yourselves."

# 3 (3) Causing Torment

"Bhikkhus, there are these two things that cause torment. What two? Here, someone has engaged in bodily misconduct but failed to engage in bodily good conduct; engaged in verbal misconduct but failed to engage in verbal good conduct; engaged in mental misconduct but failed to engage in mental good conduct. He is tormented, [thinking]: 'I have engaged in bodily misconduct'; he is tormented, [thinking]: 'I have failed to engage in bodily good conduct'; he is tormented, [thinking]: 'I have engaged in verbal misconduct'; he is tormented, [thinking]: 'I have failed to engage in verbal good conduct'; he is tormented, [thinking]: 'I have engaged in mental misconduct'; he is tormented, [thinking]: 'I have failed to engage in mental good conduct.' These, bhikkhus, are the two things that cause torment." ${ }^{\prime 220}$

## 4 (4) Not Causing Torment

"Bhikkhus, there are these two things that do not cause torment. [50] What two? Here, someone has engaged in bodily good conduct and avoided engaging in bodily misconduct; engaged in verbal good conduct and avoided engaging in verbal misconduct; engaged in mental good conduct and avoided engaging in mental misconduct. He is not tormented, [knowing]: 'I have engaged in bodily good conduct'; he is not tormented, [knowing]: 'I have avoided engaging in bodily misconduct'; he is not tormented, [knowing]: 'I have engaged in verbal good conduct'; he is not tormented, [knowing]: 'I have avoided engaging in verbal misconduct'; he is not tormented, [knowing]: 'I have engaged in mental good conduct'; he is not tormented, [knowing]: 'I have avoided engaging in mental misconduct.' These, bhikkhus, are the two things that do not cause torment."

## 5 (5) Known

"Bhikkhus, I have personally known two things: noncontentment in regard to wholesome qualities and indefatigability in siriving. ${ }^{231}$ I strove indefatigably, [resolved]: 'Willingly, let only my skin, sinews, and bones remain, and let the flesh
and blood dry up in my body, but I will not relax my energy so long as I have not attained what can be attained by manly strength, energy, and exertion. ${ }^{\prime 222}$ It was by heedfulness that I achieved enlightenment, bhikkhus; it was by heedfulness that I achieved the unsurpassed security from bondage. ${ }^{223}$

"If, bhikkhus, you too would strive indefatigably, [resolved]: 'Willingly, let only my skin, sinews, and bones remain, and let the flesh and blood dry' up in my body, but I will not relax my energy so long as I have not attained what can be attained by manly strength, energy, and exertion,' you too will, in no long time, realize for yourselves with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having entered upon it, you will dwell in it. Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will strive indefatigably, [resolved]: "Willingly, let only my skin, sinews, and bones remain, and let the flesh and blood dry up in my body, but I will not relax my energy so long as I have not attained what can be attained by manly strength, energy, and exertion."' It is in such a way that you should train yourselves."

# 6 (6) Fetter

"Bhikkhus, there are these two things. What two? Contemplation of gratification in things that can fetter and contemplation of disenchantment in things that can fetter. ${ }^{224}$ One who dwells contemplating gratification in things that can fetter does [51] not abandon lust, hatred, and delusion. Not having abandoned lust, hatred, and delusion, one is not freed from birth, from old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish; one is not freed from suffering, I say. One who dwells contemplating disenchantment in things that can fetter abandons lust, hatred, and delusion. Having abandoned lust, hatred, and delusion, one is freed from birth, from old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish; one is freed from suffering, I say. These, bhikkhus, are the two things."

7 (7) Dark

"Bhikkhus, there are these two dark qualities. What two? Moral shamelessness and moral recklessness. These are the two dark qualities."

8 (8) Bright

"Bhikkhus, there are these two bright qualities. What two? Moral shame and moral dread. ${ }^{225}$ These are the two bright qualities."

# 9 (9) Behavior

"Bhikkhus, these two bright qualities protect the world. What two? Moral shame and moral dread. If these two bright qualities did not protect the world, there would not be seen here [any restraint regarding] one's mother, aunts, or the wives of one's teachers and [other] respected people. ${ }^{226}$ The world would become promiscuous, like goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, dogs and jackals. But because these two bright qualities protect the world, there is seen here [restraint regarding] one's mother, aunts, or the wives of one's teachers and [other] respected people."

10 (10) Entering upon the Rains

"Bhikkhus, there are these two [occasions for] entering upon the rains. ${ }^{227}$ What two? The earlier and the later. These are the two [occasions for] entering upon the rains." [52]

## II. DisCIPLINARY ÎSSUES

11 (1)

"Bhikkhus, there are these two powers. What two? The power of reflection and the power of development.

"And what is the power of reflection? Here, someone reflects thus: 'Bodily misconduct has a bad result ${ }^{228}$ in the present life and in the future life; verbal misconduct has a bad result in the present life and in the future life; mental misconduct has a bad result in the present life and in the future life.' Having reflected thus, he abandons bodily misconduct and develops bodily good conduct; he abandons verbal misconduct and develops verbal good conduct; he abandons mental misconduct and develops
mental good conduct; he maintains himself in purity. This is called the power of reflection.

"And what is the power of development? The power of development is the power of trainees. ${ }^{229}$ For relying on the power of a trainee, one abandons lust, hatred, and delusion. Having abándoned lust, hatred, and delusion, one does not do anything unwholesome; one does not pursue anything bad. This is called the power of development.

"These, bhikkhus, are the two powers."

"Bhikkhus, there are these two powers. What two? The power of reflection and the power of development.

"And what is the power of reflection? Here, someone reflects thus: 'Bodily misconduct has a bad result in the present life and in the future life; verbal miscondúct has a bad result in the present life and in the future life; mental misconduct has a bad result in the present life and in the future life.' Having reflected thus, he abandons bodily misconduct and develops bodily good conduct; he abandons verbal misconduct and develops verbal good conduct; he abandons mental misconduct and develops mental good conduct; he maintains himself in purity. This is called the power of reflection.

"And what is the power of development? Here, [53] a bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness that is based upon seclusion; dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release. He develops the enlightenment factor of discrimination of phenomena ... the enlightenment factor of energy ... the enlightenment factor of rapture ... the enlightenment factor of tranquility ... the enlightenment factor of concentration ... the enlightenment factor of equanimity that is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release. This is called the power of development.

"These, bhikkhus, are the two powers."

Having reflected thus, he abandons bodily misconduct and develops bodily good conduct; he abandons verbal misconduct and develops verbal good conduct; he abandons mental misconduct and develops mental good conduct; he maintains himself in purity. This is called the power of reflection.

"And what is the power of development? Here, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. With the subsiding of thought and examination, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration, without thought and examination. With the fading away as well of rapture, he dwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, he experiences pleasure with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: 'He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.' With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity. This is called the power of development.

"These, bhikkhus, are the two powers."

"Bhikkhus, the Tathāgata has these two kinds of Dhamma teaching. What two? In brief and in detail. ${ }^{230}$ The Tathāgata has these two kinds of Dhamma teaching."

15 (5)

"Bhikkhus, if, in regard to a particular disciplinary issue, ${ }^{231}$ the bhikkhu who has committed an offense and the bhikkhu who reproves him do not each thoroughly reflect upon themselves, it can be expected that this disciplinary issue [54] will lead to acrimony and animosity for a long time and the bhikkhus will not dwell at ease. But if the bhikkhu who has committed an offense and the bhikkhu who reproves him each thoroughly
reflect upon themselves, it can be expected that this disciplinary issue will not lead to acrimony and animosity for a long time and the bhikkhus will dwell at ease.

"And how does the bhikkhu who has committed an offense thoroughly reflect upon himself? Here, the bhikkhu who has committed an offense reflects thus: 'I have committed a particular unwholesome misdeed with the body. ${ }^{232}$ That bhikkhu saw me doing so. If I had not committed a particular unwholesome misdeed with the body, he would not have seen me doing so. But because I committed a particular unwholesome misdeed with the body, he saw me doing so. When he saw me committing a particular unwholesome misdeed with the body, he became displeased. Being displeased, he expressed his displeasure to ine. Because he expressed his displeasure to me, I became displeased. Being displeased, I informed others. Thus in this case I was the one who incurred a transgression, just as a traveler does when he evades the customs duty on his goods. ${ }^{\prime 233}$. It is in this way that the bhikkhu who has committed an offense thoroughly reflects upon himself.

"And how does the reproving bhikkhu thoroughly reflect upon himself? Here, the reproving bhikkhu reflects thus: 'This bhikkhu has committed a particular unwholesome misdeed with the body. I saw him doing so. If this bhikkhu had not committed a particular unwholesome misdeed with the body, I would not have seen him doing so. [55] But because he committed a particular unwholesome misdeed with the body, I saw him doing so. When I saw him committing a particular unwholesome misdeed with the body, I became displeased. Being displeased, I expressed my displeasure to him. ${ }^{234}$ Because I expressed my displeasure to him, he became displeased. Being displeased, he informed others. Thus in this case I was the one who incurred a transgression, just as a traveler does when he evades the customs duty on his goods.' It is in this way that the reproving bhikkhu thoroughly reflects upon himself.

"If, bhikkhus, in regard to a particular disciplinary issue, the bhikkhu who has committed an offense and the bhikkhu who reproves him do not thoroughly reflect upon themselves, it can be expected that this disciplinary issue will lead to acrimony and animosity for a long time and the bhikkhus will not dwell at ease. But if the bhikkhu who has committed an offense and
the bhikkhu who reproves him thoroughly reflect upon themselves, it can be expected that this disciplinary issue will not lead to acrimony and animosity for a long time and the bhikkhus will dwell at ease."

When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One: "Why is it, Master Gotama, that some beings here, with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell?"

"Well then, brahmin, listen and attend closely. I will speak." [57]

"Yes, sir," the brahmin Jāṇussonī replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Here, brahmin, someone has done deeds of bodily misconduct, not deeds of bodily good conduct; he has done deeds of verbal misconduct, not deeds of verbal good conduct; he has done deeds of mental misconduct, not deeds of mental good conduct. Thus it is because of what has been done and what has not been done that some beings here, with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. But someone here has done deeds of bodily good conduct, not deeds of bodily misconduct; he has done deeds of verbal good conduct, not deeds of verbal misconduct; he has done deeds of mental good conduct, not deeds of mental misconduct.

"Since, Bhante, the Blessed One has declared definitively that deeds of bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, and mental misconduct are not to be done, what danger is to be expected in acting thus?"

"Ānanda, I have declared definitively that deeds of bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, and mental misconduct are not to be done because in acting thus this danger is to be expected: one blames oneself; the wise, having investigated, censure one; a bad report circulates about one; one dies confused; and with the breakup of the body, after death, one is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. I have declared definitively that deeds of bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, and mental misconduct are not to be done because in acting thus this danger is to be expected.

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you the plane of the bad person and the plane of the good person. Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"And what is the plane of the bad person? A bad person is ungrateful and unthankful. For ingratitude and unthankfulness are extolled by the bad. Ingratitude and unthankfulness belong entirely to the plane of the bad person.

"And what is the plane of the good person? A good person is grateful and thankful. For gratitude and thankfulness are extolled by the good. Gratitude and thankfulness belong entirely to the plane of the good person."

Even if one were to establish one's parents as the supreme lords and rulers over this great earth abounding in the seven treasures, one still would not have done enough for one's parents, nor would one have repaid them. For what reason? Parents are of great help to their children; they bring them up, feed them, and show them the world.

"But, bhikkhus, if, when one's parents lack faith, one encourages, settles, and establishes them in faith; if, when one's parents are immoral, one encourages, settles, and establishes them in virtuous behavior; if, when one's parents are miserly, one
encourages, settles, and establishes them in generosity; if, when one's parents are unwise, one encourages, settles, and establishes them in wisdom: in such a way, one has done enough for one's parents, repaid them, and done more than enough for them." ${ }^{252}$

"But in what way does Master Gotama assert a doctrine of deeds and a doctrine of non-doing?"

"I assert non-doing with regard to bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct; I assert non-doing with regard to the numerous kinds of bad unwholesome qualities. I assert doing with regard to good bodily, verbal, and mental conduct; I assert doing with regard to the numerous kinds of wholesome qualities. It is in this way, brahmin, that I assert a doctrine of deeds and a doctrine of non-doing."

"Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent, Master Gotama!

Then the householder Anāthapindika approached the Blessed One, [63] paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"There are, householder, two in the world worthy of offer-

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇ̣̣ika's Park. Now on that occasion the Venerable Sāriputta was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Migāramātā's Mansion in the Eastern Park. There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"255

"Friend!" those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:

"Friends, I will teach you about the person fettered internally and the person fettered externally. ${ }^{256}$ Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, friend," those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:

"And who, friends, is the person fettered internally? Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in a certain order of devas. Passing away from there, he is a returner, one who returns to this state of being. This is called the person fettered internally, who is a returner, one who returns to this state of being. ${ }^{257}$ [64]

"And who, friends, is the person fettered externally? Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. Having entered upon a certain peaceful liberation of mind, he dwells in it. ${ }^{258}$ With the breakup of the body, after death, he is
reborn in a certain order of devas. Passing away from there, he is a non-returner, one who does not return to this state of being. This is called the person fettered externally, who is a nonreturner, one who does not return to this state of being. ${ }^{259}$

"Again, friends, a bhikkhu is virtuous.... Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. He is practicing for disenchantment with sensual pleasures, dispassion toward them, and for their cessation. ${ }^{260} \mathrm{He}$ is practicing for disenchantment with states of existence, for dispassion toward them, and for their cessation. ${ }^{261}$ He is practicing for the destruction of craving. He is practicing for the destruction of greed. ${ }^{262}$ With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in a certain order of devas. Passing away from there, he is a non-returner, one who does not return to this state of being. This is called a person fettered externally, who is a non-returner, one who does not return to this state of being." ${ }^{263}$

Then a number of same-minded deities ${ }^{264}$ approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and said to him: "Bhante, at Migāramātā's Mansion in the Eastern Park, Venerable Sāriputta is teaching the bhikkhus about the person fettered internally and the person fettered externally. The assembly is thrilled. It would be good, Bhante, if the Blessed One would approach the Venerable Sāriputta out of compassion. ${ }^{1265}$ The Blessed One consented by silence.

Then, just as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, the Blessed One disappeared from Jeta's Grove and reappeared at Migāramātā's Mansion in the Eastern Park in the presence of the Venerable Sāriputta. He sat down in the seat that was prepared. The Venerable Sāriputta [65] paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to the Venerable Sāriputta:

"Here, Sāriputta, a number of same-minded deities approached me, paid homage to me, stood to one side, and said: 'Bhante, at Migāramātā's Mansion in the Eastern Park, Venerable Sāriputta is teaching the bhikkhus about the person fettered internally and the person fettered externally. The assembly is thrilled. It would be good, Bhante, if the Blessed One would approach the Venerable Sāriputta out of compassion.'

"Those deities-ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, and even sixty in number-stand in an area even as small as the tip of an awl
yet do not encroach upon one another. It may be, Sāriputta, that you think: 'Surely, it was there that those deities developed their minds in such a way that ten... and even sixty in number stand in an area even as small as the tip of an awl yet do not encroach upon one another.' But this should not be regarded in such a way. Rather, it was right here that those deities developed their minds in such a way that ten... and even sixty in number stand in an area even as small as the tip of an awl yet do not encroach upon one another. ${ }^{266}$

"Therefore, Sāriputta, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will have peaceful sense faculties and peaceful minds. ${ }^{267}$ It is in such a way that you should train yourselves. When you have peaceful sense faculties and peaceful minds, your bodily action will be peaceful, your verbal action will be peaceful, and your mental action will be peaceful. [Thinking:] 'We will offer only peaceful service to our fellow monks,' it is in such a way, Sāriputta, that you should train yourselves. Sāriputta, those wanderers of other sects are lost who did not get to hear this exposition of the Dhamma."

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Venerable Mahākaccāna was dwelling at Varaṇā on a bank of the Kaddama Lake. [66] Then the brahmin Ārāmadanda approached the Venerable Mahākaccāna and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to him: "Why is it, Master Kaccāna, that khattiyas fight with khattiyas, brahmins with brahmins, and householders with householders?"

"It is, brahmin, because of adherence to lust for sensual pleasures, bondage [to it], fixation [on it], obsession [by it], holding firmly [to it], ${ }^{268}$ that khattiyas fight with khattiyas, brahmins with brahmins, and householders with householders."

"Why is it, Master Kaccāna, that ascetics fight with ascetics?"

"It is, brahmin, because of adherence to lust for views, bondage [to it], fixation [on it], obsession [by it], holding firmly [to it], that ascetics fight with ascetics."

"Is there then anyone in the world who has overcome this adherence to lust for sensual pleasures... holding firmly [to it],
and this adherence to lust for views...holding firmly [to it]?"

"There is."

"And who is that?"

"There is, brahmin, a town to the east called Sāvatthī. There the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One is now dwelling. The Blessed One has overcome this adherence to lust for sensual pleasures, bondage [to it], fixation [on it], obsession [by it], holding firmly [to it], [67] and he has overcome. this adherence to lust for views, bondage [to it], fixation [on it], obsession [by it], holding firmly [to it]."

When this was said, the brahmin Ārāmadaṇda rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, lowered his right knee to the ground, reverently saluted in the direction of the Blessed One, and uttered this inspired utterance three times: "Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One.

# 38 (7)

On one occasion the Venerable Mahākaccāna was dwelling at Madhurā in Gundā's Grove. Then the brahmin Kand̉arāyana approached the Venerable Mahākaccāna and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to him:

"I have heard, Master Kaccāna: 'The ascetic Kaccāna does
not pay homage to brahmins who are old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage; nor does he stand up for them or offer them a seat.' This is indeed true, for Master Kaccāna does not pay homage to brahmins who are old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage; nor does he stand up for them or offer them a seat. This is not proper, Master Kaccāna." ${ }^{269}$

"Brahmin, the Blessed One, the Arahant, [68] the Perfectly Enlightened One, knowing and seeing, has proclaimed the stage of an elder and the stage of a youth. Even though someone is old-eighty, ninety, or a hundred years from birth-if he enjoys sensual pleasures, dwells in sensual pleasures, ${ }^{270}$ burns with a fever for sensual pleasures, is consumed with thoughts of sensuel pleasures, is eager in the quest for sensual pleasures, then he is reckoned as a foolish [childish] elder. But even though someone is young, a youth with dark black hair, endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life, if he does not enjoy sensual pleasures, does not dwell in sensual pleasures, does not burn with a fever for sensual pleasures, is not consumed with thoughts of sensual pleasures, is not eager in the quest for sensual pleasures, then he is reckoned as a wise elder."

When this was said, the brahmin Kandarāyana rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, and bowed down with his head at the feet of the young bhikkhus, [saying]: "You elders stand at the stage of an elder; we youths stand at the stage of a youth.

"Excellent, Master Kaccāna! ...[as in 2:37]...Let Master Kaccāna consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

# The Book of the Threes

## Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One

## The First Fifty

## I. The Fool

## 1 (1) Peril

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, whatever perils arise all arise on account of the fool, not on account of the wise person. Whatever calamities arise all arise on account of the fool, not on account of the wise person. Whatever misfortunes arise all arise on account of the fool, not on account of the wise person. Just as a fire that starts in a house made of reeds or grass burns down even a house with a peaked roof, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with bolts fastened and shutters closed; so too, whatever perils arise ... all arise on account of the fool, not on account of the wise person. (1) Thus, bhikkhus, the fool brings peril, the wise person brings no peril; (2) the fool brings calamity, the wise person brings no calamity; (3) the fool brings misfortune, the wise person brings no misfortune. There is no peril from the wise person; there is no calamity from the wise person; there is no misfortune from the wise person.

"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will avoid the three qualities possessing which one is known as a fool, and we will undertake and practice the three qualities
possessing which one is known as a wise person.' It is in this way that you should train yourselves." [102]

# 2 (2) Characteristics

"Bhikkhus, the fool is characterized by his actions; the wise person is characterized by his actions. Wisdom shines in its manifestation. ${ }^{339}$

"Bhikkhus, one who possesses three qualities should be known as a fool. What three? Bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, and mental misconduct. One who possesses these three qualities should be known as a fool. One who possesses three qualities should be known as a wise person. What three? Bodily good conduct, verbal good conduct, and mental good conduct. One who possesses these three qualities should be known as a wise person.

"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will avoid the three qualities possessing which one is known as a fool, and we will undertake and observe the three qualities possessing which one is known as a wise person.' It is in this way that you should train yourselves."

## 3 (3) Thinking

"Bhikkhus, the fool has these three characteristics of a fool, marks of a fool, manifestations of a fool. ${ }^{340}$ What three? Here, a fool thinks badly, speaks badly, and acts badly. If the fool did not think badly, speak badly, and act badly, how would wise people know of him: 'This fellow is a fool, a bad person'? But because the fool thinks badly, speaks badly, and acts badly, wise people know of him: 'This fellow is a fool, a bad person.' These are the fool's three characteristics of a fool, marks of a fool, manifestations of a fool.

"The wise person has these three characteristics of a wise person, marks of a wise person, manifestations of a wise person. What three? Here, a wise person thinks well, speaks well, and acts well. If the wise person did not think well, speak well, and act well, how would wise people know of him: 'This fellow is wise, a good person'? [103] But because the wise person thinks well, speaks well, and acts well, wise people know of him: 'This fellow is wise, a good person.' These are the wise person's three characteristics of a wise person, marks of a wise person, manifestations of a wise person.
"Therefore... [as in 3:2]... It is in this way that you should train yourselves." ${ }^{341}$

# 4 (4) Transgression

(3) When another person confesses a transgression to him, he does not accept it in accordance with the Dhamma. One who possesses these three qualities should be known as a fool.

"Therefore... It is in this way that you should train yourselves."

"Therefore...It is in this way that you should train yourselves."

## 8 (8) Afflictive

"One who possesses three qualities should be known as a wise person. What three? Unafflictive bodily action, unafflictive verbal action, and unafflictive mental action. One who possesses these three qualities should be known as a wise person.

"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will avoid the three qualities possessing which one is known as a fool, and we will undertake and observe the three qualities possessing which one is known as a wise person.' It is in this way that you should train yourselves." [105]

## 9 (9) Maimed

"Bhikkhus, possessing three qualities, the foolish, incompetent, bad person maintains himself in a maimed and injured condi-
tion; he is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise; and he generates much demerit. What three? Bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, and mental misconduct. Possessing these three qualities, the foolish, incompetent, bad person maintains himself in a maimed and injured condition; he is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise; and he generates much demerit.

Possessing these three qualities and without having abandoned these three stains, one is deposited in hell as if brought there.

"Bhikkhus, possessing three qualities and having abandoned three stains, one is deposited in heaven as if brought there. What three? (1) One is virtuous and has abandoned the stain of immorality. (2) One is not envious and has abandoned the stain of envy. (3) One is not miserly and has abandoned the stain of miserliness. Possessing these three qualities and having abandoned these three stains, one is deposited in heaven as if brought there." [106]

## II. The Cart Maker

## 11 (1) Well Known

of devas and human beings. What three? He encourages them in discordant bodily action, discordant verbal action, and discordant [mental] qualities. ${ }^{342}$ Possessing these three qualities, a well-known bhikkhu is acting for the harm of many people, for the unhappiness of many people, for the ruin, harm, and suffering of many people, of devas and human beings.

# 12 (2) To Be Remembered

"Bhikkhus, there are these three [places] that a head-anointed khattiya king should remember all his life. What three? (1) The first is the place where he was born. (2) The second is the place where he was head-anointed a khattiya king. (3) And the third is the place where, having triumphed in battle, he emerged victorious and settled at the head of the battlefield. These are the three [places] that a head-anointed khattiya king should remember all his life. [107]

"So too, bhikkhus, there are these three [places] that a bhikkhu should remember all his life. What three? (1) The first is the place where he shaved off his hair and beard, put on ochre robes, and went forth from the household life into homelessness. (2) The second is the place where he understood as it really is: 'This is suffering,' and 'This is the origin of suffering,' and 'This is the cessation of suffering,' and 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' (3) And the third is the place where, with the destruction of the tainis, he realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwelled in it. ${ }^{343}$ These are the three [places] that a bhikkhu should remember all his life."

13 (3) A Bhikkhu

"Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world. What three? The one without expectation, the one full of expectation, and the one who has overcome expectation.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the person without expectation? Here, a person has been reborn in a low family-a family of candālas, bamboo workers, hunters, cart makers, or flower scavengers ${ }^{344}$-one that is poor, with little food and drink, that subsists with difficulty, where food and clothing are obtained with difficulty; and he is ugly, unsightly, dwarfish, with much illness: blind, crippled, lame, or paralyzed. He does not obtain food, drink, clothing, and vehicles; garlands, scents, and unguents; bedding, housing, and lighting. He hears: 'The khattiyas have anointed such and such a khattiya.' It does not occur to him: 'When will the khattiyas anoint me too?' This is called the person without expectation.

(2) "And what is the person full of expectation? [108] Here, the eldest son of a head-anointed khattiya king, one due to be anointed but not yet anointed, has attained the unshaken. ${ }^{345} \mathrm{He}$ hears: 'The khattiyas have anointed such and such a khattiya.' It occurs to him: 'When will the khattiyas anoint me too?' This is called the person full of expectation.

(3) "And what is the person who has overcome expectation? Here, a head-anointed khattiya king hears: 'Such and such a khattiya has been anointed by the khattiyas.' It does not occur to him: 'When will the khattiyas anoint me too?' For what reason? Because his past expectation of anointment subsided when he was anointed. This is called the person who has overcome expectation.

"These are the three kinds of persons found existing in the world.

"So too, bhikkhus, there are three kinds of persons found existing among the bhikkhus. What three? The one without expectation, the one full of expectation, and the one who has overcome expectation.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the person without expectation? Here, some person is immoral, of bad character, of impure and suspect behavior, secretive in his actions, not an ascetic though
claiming to be one, not a celibate though claiming to be one, inwardly rotten, corrupt, depraved. He hears: 'Such and such a bhikkhu, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.' It does not occur to him: 'When will I, too, with the destruction of the taints, realize for myself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwell in it?' This is called the person without expectation.

(2) "And what is the person full of expectation? Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous, of good character. He [109] hears: 'Such and such a bhikkhu, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.' It occurs to him: 'When will I, too, with the destruction of the taints, realize for myself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwell in it?' This is called the person full of expectation.

(3) "And what is the person who has overcome expectation? Here, a bhikkhu is an arahant, one whose taints are destroyed. He hears: 'Such and such a bhikkhu, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.' It does not occur to him: 'When will I, too, with the destruction of the taints, realize for myself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwell in it?' For what reason? Because his past expectation of liberation subsided when he was liberated. This is called the person who has overcome expectation.

"These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons found existing among the bhikkhus."

# 14 (4) Wheel-Turning

"Bhikkhus, even a wheel-turning monarch, a righteous king who rules by the Dhamma, does not turn the wheel without a king above him."

When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "But, Bhante, who is the king above a wheel-turning monarch, a righteous king who rules by the Dhamma?"

"It is the Dhamma, bhikkhu," the Blessed One said. ${ }^{346}$ "Here, bhikkhu, a wheel-turning monarch, a righteous king who rules by the Dhamma, relying just on the Dhamma, honoring, respecting, and venerating the Dhamma, taking the Dhamma as his standard, banner, and authority, provides righteous protection, shelter, and guard for the people in his court. Again, a wheel-turning monarch, a righteous king who rules by the Dhamma, relying just on the Dhamma, honoring, respecting, and venerating the Dhamma, taking the Dhamma as his standard, banner, and authority, provides righteous protection, shelter, and guard for his khattiya vassals, his army, [110] brahmins and householders, the people of town and countryside, ascetics and brahmins, and the animals and birds. Having provided such righteous protection, shelter, and guard for all these beings, that wheel-turning monarch, a righteous king who rules by the Dhamma, turns the wheel solely through the Dhamma, ${ }^{347}$ a wheel that cannot be turned back by any hostile human being. ${ }^{348}$

(1) "So too, bhikkhu, the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, the righteous king of the Dhamma, relying just on the Dhamma, honoring, respecting, and venerating the Dhamma, taking the Dhamma as his standard, banner, and authority, provides righteous protection, shelter, and guard in regard to bodily action, saying: 'Such bodily action should be cultivated; such bodily action should not be cultivated.'

(2) "Again, the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, the righteous king of the Dhamma, relying just on the Dhamma, honoring, respecting, and venerating the Dhamma, taking the Dhamma as his standard, banner, and authority, provides righteous protection, shelter, and guard in regard to verbal action, saying: 'Such verbal action should be cultivated; such verbal action should not be cultivated.'

(3) "Again, the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, the righteous king of the Dhamma, relying just on the Dhamma, honoring, respecting, and venerating the Dhamma, taking the Dhamma as his standard, banner, and authority,
provides righteous protection, shelter, and guard in regard to mental action, saying: 'Such mental action should be cultivated; such mental action should not be cultivated.'

"Having provided such righteous protection, shelter, and guard in regard to bodily action, verbal action, and mental action, the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, the righteous king of the Dhamma, sets in motion the unsurpassed wheel of the Dhamma solely through the Dhamma, a wheel that cannot be turned back by any ascetic, brahmin, deva, Māra, or Brahmā, or by anyone in the world."

# 15 (5) Pacetana ${ }^{349}$

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Bārānasī in the deer park at Isipatana. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!" [111]

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, in the past there was a king named Pacetana. Then King Pacetana addressed a chariotmaker: 'Friend chariotmaker, six months from now there will be a battle. Can you make me a new pair of wheels? - 'I can, lord,' the chariotmaker replied. After six months less six days the chariotmaker had finished one wheel. King Pacetana then addressed the chariotmaker: 'Six days from now there will be a battle. Is the new pair of wheels finished?' [The chariotmaker replied:] 'In the past six months less six days, lord, I have finished one wheel.' - 'But, friend chariotmaker, can you finish a second wheel for me in the next six days?' - 'I can, lord,' the chariotmaker replied. Then, over the next six days, the chariotmaker finished the second wheel. He brought the new pair of wheels to King Pacetana and said: 'This is the new pair of wheels that I have made for you, lord.' 'What is the difference, friend chariotmaker, between the wheel that took six months less six days to complete and the one that took six days to complete? I do not see any difference between them.' - 'There is a difference, lord. Observe the difference.'

"Then the chariotmaker rolled the wheel that took six days to finish. It rolled as far as the impetus carried it, ${ }^{350}$ and then it wobbled and fell to the grötind. But the wheel that took six months [112] less six days to finish rolled as far as the impetus carried it and then stood still as if fixed on an axle. ${ }^{351}$

"[The king asked:] 'Why is it, friend chariotmaker, that the
wheel that took six days to finish rolled as far as the impetus carried it, and then wobbled and fell to the ground, while the wheel that took six months less six days to finish rolled as far as the impetus carried it and then stood still as if fixed on an axle?'

"[The chariotmaker replied:] 'The wheel that took six days to finish, lord, has a rim that is crooked, faulty, and defective; spokes that are crooked, faulty, and defective; and a nave that is crooked, faulty, and defective. For this reason, it rolled as far as the impetus carried it and then it wobbled and fell to the ground. But the wheel that took six months less six days to finish has a rim without crookedness, faults, and defects; it has spokes without crookedness, faults, and defects; and it has a nave that is without crookedness, faults, and defects. For this reason, it rolled as far as the impetus carried it and then stood still as if fixed on an axle.'

"It may be, bhikkhus, that you think: 'On that occasion the chariotmaker was someone else.' But you should not think in such a way. On that occasion, I myself was the chariotmaker. Then I was skilled in crookedness, faults, and defects in wood. But now I am the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, (1) skilled in crookedness, faults, and defects of the body; (2) skilled in crookedness, faults, and defects of speech; and (3) skilled in crookedness, faults, and defects of mind.

"Any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who has not abandoned crookedness, faults, and defects of the body, speech, and mind [113] has fallen down from this Dhamma and discipline, just as the wheel that was finished in six days [fell to the ground].

"Any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who has abandoned crookedness, faults, and defects of the body, speech, and mind is established in this Dhamma and discipline, just as the wheel that was finished in six months less six days [remained standing].

"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will abandon crookedness, faults, and defects of the body; we will abandon crookedness, faults, and defects of speech; we will abandon crookedness, faults, and defects of the mind.' It is in this way that you should train yourselves."

# 16 (6) The Unmistaken

"Bhikkhus, possessing three qualities, a bhikkhu is practicing the unmistaken way and has laid the groundwork for the
destruction of the taints. ${ }^{352}$ What three? Here, a bhikkhu guards the doors of the sense faculties, observes moderation in eating, and is intent on wakefulness. ${ }^{353}$

(1) "And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu guard the doors of the sense faculties? Here, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu does not grasp its marks and features. Since, if he left the eye faculty unrestrained, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him, he practices restraint over it; he guards the eye faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. Having heard a sound with the ear...Having smelled an odor with the nose...Having tasted a taste with the tongue... Having felt a tactile object with the body...Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, a bhikkhu does not grasp its marks and features. Since, if he left the mind faculty unrestrained, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him, he practices restraint over it; he guards the mind faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty. It is in this way that a bhikkhu guards the doors of the sense faculties. [114]

(2) "And how does a bhikkhu observe moderation in eating? Here, reflecting carefully, a bhikkhu consumes food neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness, but only for the support and maintenance of this body, for avoiding harm, and for assisting the spiritual life, considering: 'Thus I shall terminate the old feeling and not arouse a new feeling, and I shall be healthy and blameless and dwell at ease.' It is in this way that a bhikkhu observes moderation in eating.

(3) "And how is a bhikkhu intent on wakefulness? Here, during the day, while walking back and forth and sitting, a bhikkhu purifies his mind of obstructive qualities. In the first watch of the night, while walking back and forth and sitting, he purifies his mind of obstructive qualities. In the middle watch of the night he lies down on the right side in the lion's posture, with one foot overlapping the other, mindful and clearly comprehending, after noting in his mind the idea of rising. After rising, in the last watch of the night, while walking back and forth and sitting, he purifies his mind of obstructive qualities. It is in this way that a bhikkhu is intent on wakefulness.

"A bhikkhu who possesses these three qualities is practic-
ing the unmistaken way and has laid the groundwork for the destruction of the taints."

# 17 (7) Oneself

"Bhikkhus, these three qualities lead to one's own affliction, the affliction of others, and the affliction of both. What three? Bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, and mental misconduct. These three qualities lead to one's own affliction, the affliction of others, and the affliction of both.

"These three [other] qualities do not lead to one's own affliction, the affliction of others, and the affliction of both. What three? Bodily good conduct, verbal good conduct, and mental good conduct. These three qualities do not lead to one's own affliction, the affliction of others, and the affliction of both." [115]

## 18 (8) Deva

"Bhikkhus, if wanderers of other sects were to ask you thus: 'Friends, do you lead the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama for the sake of rebirth in the deva world?' wouldn't you be repelled, humiliated, and disgusted?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"Thus, bhikkhus, since you are repelled, humiliated, and disgusted with a celestial life span, celestial beauty, celestial happiness, celestial glory, and celestial authority, so much more then should you be repelled, humiliated, and disgusted with bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, and mental misconduct."

## 19 (9) Shopkeeper (1)

"Bhikkhus, possessing three factors, a shopkeeper is incapable of acquiring wealth not yet acquired or of increasing wealth already acquired. What three? Here, a shopkeeper does not diligently apply himself to his work in the morning, in the middle of the day, or in the evening. Possessing these three factors, a shopkeeper is incapable of acquiring wealth not yet acquired or of increasing wealth already acquired.

"So too, possessing three factors, a bhikkhu is incapable of achieving a wholesome state not yet attained or of increasing a wholesome state already attained. What three? Here, a bhikkhu
does not diligently apply himself to an object of concentration in the morning, in the middle of the day, or in the evening. Possessing these three factors, a bhikkhu is incapable of achieving a wholesome state not yet attained or of increasing a wholesome state already attained. [116]

# 20 (10) Shopkeeper (2)

"Bhikkhus, possessing three factors, a shopkeeper soon attains vast and abundant wealth. What three? Here, a shopkeeper has keen eyes, is responsible, and has benefactors.

(1) "And how, bhikkhus, does a shopkeeper have keen eyes? Here, a shopkeeper knows of an item: 'If this item is bought at such a price and sold at such a price, it will require this much capital and bring this much profit.' It is in this way that a shopkeeper has keen eyes.

(2) "And how is a shopkeeper responsible? Here, a shopkeeper is skilled in buying and selling goods. It is in this way that a shopkeeper is responsible.

(3) "And how does a shopkeeper have benefactors? [117] Here, rich, wealthy, affluent householders and householders' sons know him thus: 'This good shopkeeper has keen eyes and is responsible; he is able to support his wife and children and pay us back from time to time.' So they deposit wealth with him, saying: 'Having earned wealth with this, friend shopkeeper, support your wife and children and pay us back from time to time.' It is in this way that a shopkeeper has benefactors.
"Possessing these three factors, a shopkeeper soon attains vast and abundant wealth.

"So too, bhikkhus, possessing three qualities, a bhikkhu soon attains vast and abundant wholesome qualities. What three? Here, a bhikkhu has keen eyes, is responsible, and has benefactors.

(1) "And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu have keen eyes? Here, a bhikkhu understands as it really is: 'This is suffering'...'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' It is in this way that a bhikkhu has keen eyes.

(2) "And how is a bhikkhu responsible? Here, a bhikkhu has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities. It is in this way that a bhikkhu is responsible.

(3) "And how does a bhikkhu have benefactors? Here, from time to time a bhikkhu approaches those bhikkhus who are learned, heirs to the heritage, experts on the Dhamma, experts on the discipline, experts on the outlines, ${ }^{354}$ and inquires: 'How is this, Bhante? What is the meaning of this?' Those venerable ones then disclose to him what has not been disclosed, clear up what is obscure, and dispel his perplexity about numerous perplexing points. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has benefactors. [118]

"Possessing these three qualities, a bhikkhu soon attains vast and abundant wholesome qualities."

# III. PERSONS

## 21 (1) Savittha

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇ̣ika's Park. Then the Venerable Savitṭha and the Venerable Mahākottthita approached the Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, they sat down to one side. The Venerable Sāriputta then said to the Venerable Savitṭha:

"Friend Savittha, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world. What three? The body witness, the one attained to view, and the one liberated by faith. ${ }^{355}$ These are the three kinds of persons found existing in the world. Which of
these three kinds of persons do you consider the most excellent and sublime?"

"Friend Sāriputta, of those three kinds of persons, I consider the one liberated by faith to be the most excellent and sublime. ${ }^{386}$ For what reason? Because this person's faculty of faith is predominant."

Then the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Venerable Mahākotṭhita: "Friend Kotthita, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world.... [119] Which of these three kinds of persons do you consider the most excellent and sublime?"

"Friend Sāriputta, of those three kinds of persons, I consider the body witness to be the most excellent and sublime. For what reason? Because this person's faculty of concentration is predominant."

Then the Venerable Mahākotṭhita said to the Venerable Sāriputta: "Friend Sāriputta, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world.... Which of these three kinds of persons do you consider the most excellent and sublime?"

"Friend Kotthita, of those three kinds of persons, I consider the one attained to view to be the most excellent and sublime. For what reason? Because this person's faculty of wisdom is predominant."

Then the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Venerable Savittha and the Venerable Mahākotthita: "Friends, we have each explained according to our own ideal. Come, let's approach the Blessed One and report this matter to him. We will retain it in mind as he explains it to us."

"Yes, friend," the Venerable Savittha and the Venerable Mahākotthita replied. Then the Venerable Sāriputta, the VenerableSavittha, and the Venerable Mahākotthita approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. [120] The Venerable Sāriputta then reported to him the entire conversation that had taken place.

[The Blessed One said:] "It isn't easy, Sāriputta, to make a definitive declaration about this matter and say: 'Of these three kinds of persons, this one is the most excellent and sublime.'

(1) "For it is possible that a person liberated by faith is practicing for arahantship, while a body witness and one
attained to view are once-returners or non-returners. It isn't easy, Sāriputta, to make a definitive declaration about this matter and say: 'Of these three kinds of persons, this one is the most excellent and sublime.'

(2) "It is possible that a person who is a body witness is practicing for arahantship, while one liberated by faith and one attained to view are once-returners or non-returners. It isn't easy, Sāriputta, to make a definitive declaration about this matter and say: 'Of these three kinds of persons, this one is the most excellent and sublime.'

(3) "It is possible that a person attained to view is practicing for arahantship, ${ }^{357}$ while one liberated by faith and a body witness are once-returners or non-returners. It isn't easy, Sāriputta, to make a definitive declaration about this matter and say: 'Of these three kinds of persons, this one is the most excellent and sublime.'"

# 22 (2) Patients

"Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of patients found existing in the world. What three? (1) Here, one patient will not recover from his illness whether or not he gets suitable food, suitable medicine, [121] and a competent attendant. (2) Another patient will recover from his illness whether or not he gets suitable food, suitable medicine, and a competent attendant. (3) Still another patient will recover from his illness only if he gets suitable food, not if he fails to get it; only if he gets suitable medicine, not if he fails to get it; and only if he gets a competent attendant, not if he fails to get one.

"Food and medicine and a competent attendant are prescribed particularly for the sake of the patient who will recover from his illness only if he gets suitable food, not if he fails to get it; only if he gets suitable medicine, not if he fails to get it; and only if he gets a competent attendant, not if he fails to get one. But because of this patient, the other patients should also be served. These are the three kinds of patients found existing in the world.

"So too, bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of persons similar to patients found existing in the world. What three? (1) Here, some person will not enter upon the fixed course [consisting in] rightness in wholesome qualities whether or not he gets to see the Tathāgata and whether or not he gets to hear
the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata. ${ }^{358}$ (2) Then another person will enter upon the fixed course [consisting in] rightness in wholesome qualities whether or not he gets to see the Tathāgata and whether or not he gets to hear the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata. (3) And still another person will enter upon the fixed course [consisting in] rightness in wholesome qualities only if he gets to see the Tathāgata, not if he fails to see him; only if he gets to hear the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, not if he fails to hear it. [122]

"The teaching of the Dhamma is prescribed particularly for the sake of the person who will enter upon the fixed course [consisting in] rightness in wholesome qualities only if he gets to see the Tathāgata, not if he fails to see him; only if he gets to hear the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, not if he fails to hear it. But because of this person, the Dhamma should also be taught to the others. These are the three kinds of persons similar to patients found existing in the world."

# 23 (3) Volitional Activities

"Bhikkhus, there are three kinds of persons found existing in the world. What three?

(1) "Here, bhikkhus, some person generates afflictive bodily activities, afflictive verbal activities, and afflictive mental activities. ${ }^{399}$ In consequence, he is reborn in an afflictive world. When he is reborn in an afflictive world, afflictive contacts touch him. Being touched by afflictive contacts, he feels afflictive feelings, exclusively painful, as in the case of hell-beings.

(2) "Someone else generates unafflictive bodily activities, unafflictive verbal activities, and unafflictive mental activities. In consequence, he is reborn in an unafflictive world. When he is reborn in an unafflictive world, unafflictive contacts touch him. Being touched by unafflictive contacts, he feels unafflictive feelings, exclusively pleasant, as in the case of the devas of refulgent glory. ${ }^{360}$

(3) "Still another generates bodily activities that are both afflictive and unafflictive, verbal activities that are both afflictive and unafflictive, and mental activities that are both afflictive and unafflictive. In consequence, [123] he is reborn in a world that is both afflictive and unafflictive. When he is reborn
in a world that is both afflictive and unafflictive, both afflictive and unafflictive contacts touch him. Being touched by both afflictive and unafflictive contacts, he feels both afflictive and unafflictive feelings, mingled pleasure and pain, as in the case of human beings, some devas, and some beings in the lower worlds. ${ }^{361}$

"These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons found existing in the world."

# 24 (4) Helpful

"Bhikkhus, these three persons are helpful to another person. What three?

(1) "The person through whom another has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. This person is helpful to the other person.

(2) "Again, the person through whom another comes to understand as it really is: 'This is suffering,' and 'This is the origin of suffering,' and 'This is the cessation of suffering,' and 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' This person is helpful to the other person. ${ }^{362}$

(3) "Again, the person through whom, with the destruction of the taints, another realizes for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it. This person is helpful to the other person.

"These three persons are helpful to another person.

"I say, bhikkhus, that there is no one more helpful to another person than these three persons. I say, too, that it is not easy to repay these three persons by paying homage to them, by rising up for them, by reverential salutation, by proper conduct, and by presenting them with robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick."

## 25 (5) Diamond

"Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world. [124] What three? One whose mind is like an open sore, one whose mind is like lightning, and one whose mind is like a diamond.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the person whose mind is like an open sore? Here, some person is prone to anger and easily
exasperated. Even if he is criticized slightly he loses his temper and becomes irritated, hostile, and stubborn; he displays irritation, hatred, and bitterness. Just as a festering sore, if struck by a stick or a shard, will discharge even more matter, so too some person here is prone to anger... and displays irritation, hatred, and bitterness. This person is said to have a mind like an open sore.

(2) "And what is the person whose mind is like lightning? Here, some person understands as it really is: 'This is suffering,' and 'This is the origin of suffering,' and 'This is the cessation of suffering,' and 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' Just as, in the dense darkness of night, a man with good sight can see forms by a flash of lightning, so too some person here understands as it really is: 'This is suffering'... 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' This person is said to have a mind like lightning.

(3) "And what is the person whose mind is like a diamond? Here, with the destruction of the taints, some person realizes for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it. Just as there is nothing that a diamond cannot cut, whether gem or stone, so too, with the destruction of the taints, some person realizes for himself with direct knowledge ... the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and ...dwells in it. This person is said to have a mind like a diamond.

"These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons found existing in the world."

# 26 (6) To Be Associated With

"Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world. What three? (1) There is a person who is not to be associated with, followed, and served; (2) a person who is to be associated with, followed, and served; and (3) [125] a person who is to be associated with, followed, and served with honor and respect.

(1) "And what kind of person, bhikkhus, is not to be associated with, followed, and served? Here, some person is inferior [to oneself] in virtucus behavior, concentration, and wisdom. Such a person is not to be associated with, followed, and served except out of sympathy and compassion.
(2) "And what kind of person is to be associated with, followed, and served? Here, some person is similar [to oneself] in virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom. Such a person is to be associated with, followed, and served. For what reason? [Because one considers:] 'Since we are similar with regard to virtuous behavior, we will have a discussion on virtuous behavior, and it will flow on smoothly between us, and we will feel at ease. Since we are similar with regard to concentration, we will have a discussion on concentration, and it will flow on smoothly between us, and we will feel at ease. Since we are similar with regard to wisdom, we will have a discussion on wisdom, and it will flow on smoothly between us, and we will feel at ease.' Therefore such a person is to be associated with, followed, and served.

(3) "And what kind of person is to be associated with, followed, and served with honor and respect? Here, some person is superior [to oneself] in virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom. Such a person is to be associated with, followed, and served with horior and respect. For what reason? [Because one considers:] 'In such a way I will fulfill the aggregate of virtuous behavior that I have not yet fulfilled or assist with wisdom in various respects the aggregate of virtuous behavior that I have fulfilled. I will fulfill the aggregate of concentration that I have not yet fulfilled or assist with wisdom in various respects the aggregate of concentration that I have fulfilled. I will fulfill the aggregate of wisdom that I have not yet fulfilled or assist with wisdom in various respects the aggregate of wisdom that I have fulfilled. ${ }^{363}$ Therefore such a person is to be associated with, followed, and served with honor and respect.

"These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons found existing in the world." [126]

One who associates with an inferior person declines; one who associates with an equal does not decline; attending on a superior person one develops quickly; therefore you should follow one superior to yourself.

# 27 (7) Disgust

"Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world. What three? (1) There is a person who is to be looked upon with disgust, not to be associated with, followed, and
served; (2) a person who is to be looked upon with equanimity, not to be associated with, followed, and served; and (3) a person who is to be associated with, followed, and served.

(1) "And what kind of person, bhikkhus, is to be looked upon with disgust, not to be associated with, followed, and served? Here, some person is immoral, of bad character, impure, of suspect behavior, secretive in his actions, not an ascetic though claiming to be one, not a celibate though claiming to be one, inwardly rotten, corrupt, depraved. Such a person is to be looked upon with disgust, not to be associated with, followed, and served. For what reason? Even though one does not follow the example of such a person, a bad report still circulates about oneself: 'He has bad friends, bad companions, bad comrades.' Just as a snake that has passed through feces, though it does not bite one, would smear one, so too, though one does not follow the example of such a person, a bad report still circulates about oneself: 'He has bad friends, bad companions, bad comrades.' Therefore such a person is to be looked upon with disgust, not to be associated with, followed, and served.

(2) "And what kind of person is to be looked upon with equanimity, not to be associated with, followed, and served? Here, some person is prone to anger [127] and easily exasperated. Even if he is criticized slightly he loses his temper and becomes irritated, hostile, and stubborn; he displays irritation, hatred, and bitterness. Just as a festering sore, if struck by a stick or a shard, will discharge even more matter, so too...Just as a firebrand of the tinduka tree, if struck by a stick or shard, will sizzle and crackle even more, so too...Just as a pit of feces, if struck by a stick or a shard, becomes even more foul-smelling, so too some person here is prone to anger and... displays irritation, hatred, and bitterness. Such a person is to be looked upon with equanimity, not to be associated with, followed, and served. For what reason? [With the thought:] 'He might insult me, revile me, and do me harm.' Therefore such a person is to be looked upon with equanimity, not to be associated with, followed, and served.

(3) "And what kind of person is to be associated with, followed, and served? Here, some person is virtuous and of good character. Such a person is to be associated with, followed, and served. For what reason? Even though one does not follow
the example of such a person, a good report still circulates about oneself: 'He has good friends, good companions, good comrades.' Therefore such a person is to be associated with, followed, and served.

"These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons found existing in the world."

[A verse is attached identical with that in 3:26.]

28 (8) Speech Like Dung

"Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world. [128] What three? The one whose speech is like dung, the one whose speech is like flowers, and the one whose speech is like honey.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the person whose speech is like dung? Here, if he is summoned to a council, to an assembly, to his relatives' presence, to his guild, or to the court, and questioned as a witness thus: 'So, good man, tell what you know,' then, not knowing, this person says, 'I know,' or knowing, he says, 'I do not know'; not seeing, he says, 'I see,' or seeing, he says, 'I do not see.' Thus he consciously speaks falsehood for his own ends, or for another's ends, or for some trifling worldly end. ${ }^{364}$ This is called the person whose speech is like dung.

(2) "And what is the person whose speech is like flowers? Here, if he is summoned to a council, to an assembly, to his relatives' presence, to his guild, or to the court, and questioned as a witness thus: 'So, good man, tell what you know,' then, not knowing, this person says, 'I do not know,' or knowing, he says, 'I know'; not seeing, he says, 'I do not see,' or seeing, he says, 'I see'; he does not consciously speak falsehood for his own ends, or for another's ends, or for some trifling worldly end. This is called the person whose speech is like flowers.

(3) "And what is the person whose speech is like honey? Here, some person, having abandoned harsh speech, abstains from harsh speech. He speaks such words as are gentle, pleasing to the ear, and lovable, as go to the heart, are courteous, desired by many, and agreeable to many. This is the person whose speech is like honey.

"These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons found existing in the world."

29 (9) Blind

"Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world. What three? The blind person, the one-eyed person, and the two-eyed person.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the blind person? Here, some person lacks the kind of eye [129] with which one can acquire wealth not yet acquired and increase wealth already acquired, and he also lacks the kind of eye with which one can know wholesome and unwholesome qualities, blameworthy and blameless qualities, inferior and superior qualities, dark and bright qualities with their counterparts. This is called the blind person.

(2) "And what is the one-eyed person? Here, some person has the kind of eye with which one can acquire wealth not yet acquired and increase wealth already acquired, but he lacks the kind of eye with which one can know wholesome and unwholesome qualities, blameworthy and blameless qualities, inferior and superior qualities, dark and bright qualities with their counterparts. This is called the one-eyed person.

(3) "And what is the two-eyed person? Here, some person has the kind of eye with which one can acquire wealth not yet acquired and increase wealth already acquired, and he also has the kind of eye with which one can know wholesome and unwholesome qualities, blameworthy and blameless qualities, inferior and superior qualities, dark and bright qualities with their counterparts. This is called the two-eyed person.

"These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons found existing in the world."

He does not possess such wealth, nor does he do deeds of merit; the blind man destitute of eyes casts an unlucky throw in both respects.

The person described as one-eyed is a hypocrite who seeks wealth, [sometimes] righteously [and sometimes] unrighteously.

Both by thievish cheatful acts and by means of false speech
the man indulging in sensual pleasures is skilled in amassing wealth.

Having gone from here to hell, the one-eyed person is tormented.

One with two eyes is said to be the best kind of person.

His wealth ${ }^{365}$ is acquired by his own exertion, with goods righteously gained. [130]

With best intentions he then gives, this person with an undivided mind.

He goes to [rebirth in] an excellent state where, having gone, one does not sorrow.

One should avoid from afar the blind one and the one-eyed person, but should befriend the one with two eyes, the best kind of person.

# 30 (10) Inverted

"Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world. What three? The person with inverted wisdom, the person with lap-like wisdom, and the person with wide wisdom.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the person with inverted wisdom? Here, some person often goes to the monastery to listen to the Dhamma from the bhikkhus. The bhikkhus teach him the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; they reveal the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life. While he is sitting in his seat, he does not attend to that talk at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end. After he has risen from his seat, he still does not attend to that talk at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end. Just as, when a pot is turned upside down, the water that had been poured into it runs off and does not remain there, so too, some person often goes to the monastery to listen to the Dhamma from the bhikkhus.... After he has risen from his seat, he still does not attend to that talk at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end. This is called the person with inverted wisdom.
(2) "And what is the person with lap-like wisdom? Here, some person often goes to the monastery to listen to the Dhamma from the bhikkhus. The bhikkhus teach him the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; they reveal the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life. While he is sitting in his seat, he attends to that talk at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end. But after he has risen from his seat, he does not attend to that talk at the beginning; in the middle, or at the end. Just as, when a person has various food stuffs strewn over his lap-sesamum seeds, rice grains, cakes, and jujubes-if he loses his mindfulness when rising from that seat, [131] he would scatter them all over, so too, some person often goes to the monastery to listen to the Dhamma from the bhikkhus... But after he has risen from his seat, he does not attend to that talk at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end. This is called the person with lap-like wisdom.

(3) "And what is the person with wide wisdom? Here, some person often goes to the monastery to listen to the Dhamma from the bhikkhus. The bhikkhus teach him the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; they reveal the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life. While he is sitting in his seat, he attends to that talk at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end. After he has risen from his seat, again he attends to that talk at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end. Just as, when a pot is kept upright, the water that had been poured into it stays there and does not run off, so too, some person often goes to the monastcry to listen to the Dhamma from the bhikkhus.... After he has risen from his seat, again he attends to that talk at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end. This is called the person with wide wisdom.

"These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons found existing in the world."

The person with inverted wisdom, stupid and undiscerning, often goes to visit bhikkhus [to hear them teach the Dhamma].

Yet this person cannot grasp anything from the talk, at its beginning, middle, and end, for he utterly lacks wisdom.

The person with lap-like wisdom is said to be better than the former. He too often goes to visit bhikkhus [to hear them teach the Dhamma].

While sitting in his seat, he grasps the phrasing of the talk, at its beginning, middle, and end. But after rising, he no longer understands, but forgets what he had learned.

The person with wide wisdom is said to be the best of these. He too often goes to visit bhikkhus [to hear them teach the Dhamma].

While sitting in his seat, he comprehends the phrasing, at the beginning, middle, and end of the talk [given by the bhikkhu].

This person of the best intentions, his mind undivided, retains [what he hears]. Practicing in accordance with the Dhamma, he can make an end of suffering. [132]

# IV. Divine Messengers

## 31 (1) Brahma

(1) "Bhikkhus, those families dwell with Brahmā where at home the mother and father are revered by their children. (2) Those families dwell with the first teachers where at home the mother and father are revered by their children. (3) Those families dwell with the gift-worthy where at home the mother and father are revered by their children.
"Brahmā,' bhikkhus, is a designation for mother and father. 'First teachers' is a designation for mother and father. 'Giftworthy' is a designation for mother and father. For what reason? Mother and father are helpful to their children: they raise them, nurture them, and show them the world."

Mother and father are called "Brahmā" and also "first teachers."

They are worthy of gifts from their children, for they have compassion for their offspring.

Therefore a wise person should revere them, and show them due honor, serve them with food and drink, with clothes and bedding, by massaging and bathing them, and by washing their feet.

Because of this service to mother and father, the wise praise one in this world and after death one rejoices in heaven.

# 32 (2) Ānanda

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, could a bhikkhu obtain such a state of concentration that (1) he would have no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard to this conscious body; (2) he would have no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard to all external objects; and (3) he would enter and dwell in that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, through which there is no more I-making, minemaking, and underlying tendency to conceit for one who enters and dwells in it?" ${ }^{\prime 366}$

"He could, Ānanda."

"But how, Bhante, could he obtain such a state of concentration?" [133]

"Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu thinks thus: 'This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, the stilling of all activities, the relinquishing
of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, nibbana.' In this way, Ananda, a bhikkhu could obtain such a state of concentration that he would have no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard to this conscious body; he would have no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard to all external objects; and he would enter and dwell in that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, through which there is no more I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit for one who enters and dwells in it. And it was with reference to this that I said in the Pārāyana, in 'The Questions of Punnaka': ${ }^{367}$

"Having comprehended the highs and lows in the world, he is not perturbed by anything in the world.

Peaceful, fumeless, untroubled, wishless, he has, I say, crossed over birth and old age."

# 33 (3) Sāriputta ${ }^{368}$

Then the Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Sāriputta, I can teach the Dhamma briefly; I can teach the Dhamma in detail; I can teach the Dhamma both briefly and in detail. It is those who can understand that are rare."

"It is the time for this, Blessed One. It is the time for this, Fortunate One. The Blessed One should teach the Dhamma briefly; he should teach the Dhamma in detail; he should teach the Dhamma both briefly and in detail. There will be those who can understand the Dhamma."

"Therefore, Sāriputta, you should train yourselves thus: (1) 'There will be no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard to this conscious body; (2) there will be no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard to all external objects; and (3) we will enter and dwell in that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, through which there is no more I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit for one who enters and dwells in it.' It is in this way, Sāriputta, that you should train yourselves.

"When, Sāriputta, a bhikkhu [134] has no I-making, minemaking, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard to this
conscious body; when he has no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard to all external objects; and when he enters and dwells in that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, through which there is no more I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit for one who enters and dwells in it, he is called a bhikkhu who has cut off craving, stripped off the fetter, and, by completely breaking through conceit, has made an end of suffering. And it was with reference to this that I said in the Pārāyana, in 'The Questions of Udaya':369

"The abandoning of both sensual perceptions and dejection; the dispelling of dullness, the warding off of remorse; ${ }^{370}$

"purified equanimity and mindfulness preceded by reflection on the Dhamma: this, I say, is emancipation by final knowledge, the breaking up of ignorance." ${ }^{371}$

# 34 (4) Causes

"Bhikkhus, there are these three causes for the origination of kamma. What three? Greed is a cause for the origination of kamma; hatred is a cause for the origination of kamma; delusion is a cause for the origination of kamma.

(1) "Any kamma, bhikkhus, fashioned through greed, born of greed, caused by greed, originated by greed, ripens wherever the individual is reborn. Wherever that kamma ripens, it is there that one experiences its result, either in this very life, or in the [next] rebirth, or on some subsequent occasion. ${ }^{372}$

(2) "Any kamma fashioned through hatred, born of hatred, caused by hatred, originated by hatred, ripens wherever the individual is reborn. Wherever that kamma ripens, it is there that one experiences its result, either in this very life, or in the [next] rebirth, or on some subsequent occasion.

(3) "Any kamma fashioned through delusion, born of delusion, caused by delusion, originated by delusion, ripens wherever the individual is reborn. Wherever that kamma ripens, [135] it is there that one experiences its result, either in this very life, or in the [next] rebirth, or on some subsequent occasion.
"Suppose, bhikkhus, seeds that are intact, unspoiled, not damaged by wind and the sun's heat, fecund, well preserved, were deposited in well-prepared ground in a good field and receive proper rainfall: in this way, those seeds would grow, increase, and mature. So too, any kamma that is fashioned through greed... hatred...delusion, born of delusion, caused by delusion, originated by delusion, ripens wherever the individual is reborn. Wherever that kamma ripens, it is there that one experiences its result, either in this very life, or in the [next] rebirth, or on some subsequent occasion.

"These are the three causes for the origination of kamma.

"Bhikkhus, there are these three [other] causes for the origination of kamma. What three? Non-greed is a cause for the origination of kamma; non-hatred is a cause for the origination of kamma; non-delusion is a cause for the origination of kamma.

(1) "Any kamma, bhikkhus, fashioned through non-greed, born of non-greed, caused by non-greed, originated by nongreed, is abandoned when greed has vanished; it is cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising. ${ }^{373}$

(2) "Any kamma fashioned through non-hatred, born of non-hatred, caused by non-hatred, originated by non-hatred, is abandoned when hatred has vanished; it is cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising.

(3) "Any kamma fashioned through non-delusion, born of non-delusion, caused by non-delusion, originated by nondelusion, is abandoned when delusion has vanished; it is cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising.

"Suppose, bhikkhus, there are seeds that are intact, unspoiled, [136] not damaged by wind and the suri's heat, fecund, well preserved. Then a man would burn them in a fire, reduce them to ashes, and winnow the ashes in a strong wind or let them be carried away by the swift current of a river. In this way, those seeds would be cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that they are no more subject to future arising. So too, any kamma that is fashioned through non-greed:.. nonhatred...non-delusion, born of non-delusion, caused by nondelusion, originated by non-delusion, is abandoned when delusion has vanished; it is cut off at the root, made like a
palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising."

"These, bhikkhus, are the three causes for the origination of kamma."

Whatever kamma an ignorant person [has done] born of greed, hatred, and delusion, whether what was fashioned by him be little or much, it is to be experienced right here: there exists no other site [for it]. ${ }^{374}$

Therefore a wise person should abandon [any deed] born of greed, hatred, and delusion. A bhikkhu, giving rise to knowledge, should abandon all bad destinations. ${ }^{375}$

# 35 (5) Hatthaka

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at $\bar{A} l a v i ̄$ on a heap of leaves spread out on a cow track in a simsapā grove. Then Hatthaka of $\bar{A} l a v i{ }^{376}$ while walking and wandering for exercise, saw the Blessed One sitting there. He then approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to the Blessed One:

"Bhante, did the Blessed One sleep well?"

"Yes, prince, I slept well. I am one of those in the world who sleep well."

"But, Bhante, the winter nights are cold. It is the eight-day interval, the time when snow falls. ${ }^{377}$ The ground trampled by the hooves of cattle is rough, the spread of leaves is thin, [137] the leaves on the tree are sparse, the ochre robes leave one cold, and the gale wind blows cold. Yet the Blessed One says thus: 'Yes, prince, I slept well. I am one of those in the world who sleep well.'"

"Well then, prince, I will question you about this matter. You should answer as you see fit. What do you think, prince? A householder or a householder's son might have a house with a peaked roof, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with bolts fastened and shutters closed. There he might have a couch spread with rugs, blankets, and covers, with an excellent covering of antelope hide, with a canopy above and red bolsters at both ends. An oil lamp would be burning and his four wives would
serve him in extremely agreeable ways. What do you think, would he sleep well or not, or what do you think about this?"

"He would sleep well, Bhante. He would be one of those in the world who sleep well."

(1) "What do you think, prince? Might there arise in that householder or householder's son bodily and mental fevers born of lust, which would torment him so that he would sleep badly?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"There might arise in that householder or householder's son bodily and mental fevers born of lust, which would torment him so that he would sleep badly; but the Tathāgata has abandoned such lust, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising. Therefore I have slept well.

(2) "What do you think, prince? Might there arise in that householder or householder's son bodily and mental fevers born of hatred...(3)...bodily and mental fevers born of delusion, which would torment him so that he would sleep badly?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"There might arise in that householder or householder's son bodily and mental fevers born of delusion, which would torment him so that he would sleep badly; but the Tathāgata has abandoned such delusion, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, [138] obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising. Therefore I have slept well."

He always sleeps well, the brahmin who has attained nibbāna, cooled off, without acquisitions, not tainted by sensual pleasures.

Having cut off all attachments, having removed anguish in the heart, the peaceful one sleeps well, having attained peace of mind. ${ }^{378}$

36 (6) Messengers ${ }^{379}$

"Bhikkhus, there are these three divine messengers. ${ }^{380}$ What three?

"Here, bhikkhus; someone engages in misconduct by body,
speech, and mind. In consequence, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. There the wardens of hell grab him by both arms and show him to King Yama, ${ }^{381}$ [saying]: 'This person, your majesty, did not behave properly toward his mother and father; he did not behave properly toward ascetics and brahmins; and he did not honor the elders of the family. May your majesty inflict due punishment on him!'

(1) "Then King Yama questions, interrogates, and crossexamines him about the first divine messenger: 'Good man, didn't you see the first divine messenger that appeared among human beings?' And he replies: 'No, lord, I didn't see him.'

"Then King Yama says to him: 'But, good man, didn't you ever see among human beings a man or a woman, eighty, ninety or a hundred years of age, frail, bent like a roof bracket, crooked, wobbling as they go along leaning on a stick, ailing, youth gone, with broken teeth, with grey and scanty hair or bald, with wrinkled skin and blotched limbs?' And the man replies: 'Yes, lord, I have seen this.'

"Then King Yama says to him: 'Good man, didn't it occur to you, an intelligent and mature person: "I too am subject to old age, I am not exempt from old age. Let me now do good by body, speech, and mind"?' [139] - 'No, lord, I could not. I was heedless.'

"Then King Yama says: 'Through heedlessness, good man, you failed to do good by body, speech, or mind. Surely, they will treat you in a way that fits your heedlessness. That bad kamma of yours was not done by your mother or father, nor by your brother or sister, nor by your friends and companions, nor by your relatives and family members, nor by the deities, nor by ascetics and brahmins. Rather, you were the one who did that bad kamma, and you yourself will have to experience its result.'

(2) "When King Yama has questioned, interrogated, and cross-examined him about the first divine messenger, he again questions, interrogates, and cross-examines him about the second divine messenger: 'Good man, didn't you see the second divine messenger that appeared among human beings?' And he replies: 'No, lord, I didn't see him.'

"Then King Yama'says to him: 'But, good man, didn't you
ever see among human beings a man or a woman, sick, afflicted, gravely ill, lying in his own urine and excrement, having to be lifted up by some and put down by others?' And he replies: 'Yes, lord, I have seen this.'

"Then King Yama says to him: 'Good man, didn't it occur to you, an intelligent and mature person: "I too am subject to illness, I am not exempt from illness. Let me now do good by body, speech, and mind"?' - 'No, lord, I could not. I was heedless.'

"Then King Yama says: [140] 'Through heedlessness, good man, you failed to do good by body, speech, or mind. Surely, they will treat you in a way that fits your heedlessness. That bad kamma of yours was not done by your mother or father, nor by your brother or sister, nor by your friends and companions, nor by your relatives and family members, nor by the deities, nor by ascetics and brahmins. Rather, you were the one who did that bad kamma, and you yourself will have to experience its result.'

(3) "When King Yama has questioned, interrogated, and cross-examined him about the second divine messenger, he again questions, interrogates, and cross-examines him about the third divine messenger: 'Good man, didn't you see the third divine messenger that appeared among human beings?' And he replies: 'No, lord, I didn't see him.'

"Then King Yama says to him: 'Bút, good man, didn't you ever see among human beings a man or a woman, one, two, or three days dead, the corpse bloated, livid, and festering?' And he replies: 'Yes, lord, I have seen this.'

"Then King Yama says to him: 'Good man, didn't it occur to you, an intelligent and mature person: "I too am subject to death, I am not exempt from death. Let me now do good by body, speech, and mind"?' - 'No, lord, I could not. I was heedless.'

"Then King Yama says: 'Through heedlessness, good man, you failed to do good by body, speech, or mind. Surely, they will treat you in a way that fits your heedlessness. That bad kamma of yours was not done by your mother or father, nor by your brother or sister, nor by your friends and companions, nor by your relatives and family members, nor by the deities, nor by ascetics and brahmins. Rather, you were the one who
did that bad kamma, and you yourself will have to experience its result.'

"When, bhikkhus, King Yama has questioned, interrogated, and cross-examined him about the third divine messenger, he falls silent. [141] Then the wardens of hell torture him with the fivefold transfixing. They drive a red-hot iron stake through one hand and another red-hot iron stake through the other hand; they drive a red-hot iron stake through one foot and another red-hot iron stake through the other foot; they drive a red-hot iron stake through the middle of his chest. There he feels painful, racking, piercing feelings, ${ }^{362}$ yet he does not die so long as that bad kamma is not exhausted.

"Next the wardens of hell throw him down and pare him with axes. There he feels painful, racking, piercing feelings, yet he does not die so long as that bad kamma is not exhausted. Next the wardens of hell turn him upside down and pare him with adzes.... Next the wardens of hell harness him to a chariot and drive him back and forth across ground that is burning, blazing, and glowing.... Next the wardens of hell make him climb up and down a great mound of coals that are burning, blazing, and glowing.... Next the wardens of hell turn him upside down and plunge him into a red-hot copper cauldron that is burning, blazing, and glowing. He is cooked there in a swirl of foam. And as he is being cooked there in a swirl of foam, he is swept now up, now down, and now across. There he feels painful, racking, piercing feelings, yet he does not die so long as that bad kamma is not exhausted.

"Next the wardens of hell throw him into the great hell. Now, bhikkhus, as to that great hell:

"It has four corners and four doors and is divided into separate compartments; it is surrounded by iron ramparts and shut in with an iron roof. [142]

"Its floor as well is made of iron and heated till it glows with fire. The range is a full hundred yojanas which it ever covers pervasively.
"Once, bhikkhus, in the past King Yama thought: 'Those in the world who do evil deeds are punished with such diverse tortures. Oh, that I might attain the human state! That a Tathāgata, Arahant, Perfectly Enlightened One might arise in the world! That I might attend upon that Blessed One! That the Blessed One might teach me the Dhamma, and that I might come to understand his Dhamma!'

"Bhikkhus, I am not repeating something that I heard from another ascetic or brahmin, but rather I am speaking about a matter that I have actually known, seen, and understood myself."

Though warned by the divine messengers, those people who remain heedless sorrow for a long time, having fared on to a lower realm.

But those good people here who, when warned by the divine messengers, never become heedless

in regard to the noble Dhamma; who, having seen the peril in clinging as the origin of birth and death, are liberated by non-clinging in the extinction of birth and death: those happy ones have attained security; ${ }^{383}$ they have reached nibbāna in this very life. Having overcome all enmity and peril, they have transcended all suffering.

# 37 (7) Kings (1)

"Bhikkhus, (1) on the eighth of the fortnight, the ministers and assembly members of the four great kings wander over this world, ${ }^{384}$ [thinking]: 'We hope there are many people who behave properly toward their mother and father, behave properly toward ascetics and brahmins, honor the elders of the family, observe the uposatha, keep the extra observance days, and do meritorious deeds. ${ }^{385}$ (2) On the fourteenth of the fortnight, the sons of the four great kings wander over this world, [thinking]: 'We hope there are many people who behave properly toward
their mother and father... [143]... and do meritorious deeds.' (3) On the fifteenth, the uposatha day, the four great kings themselves wander over this world, [thinking]: 'We hope there are many people who behave properly toward their mother and father... and do meritorious deeds.'

"If, bhikkhus, there are few people who behave properly toward their mother and father... and do meritorious deeds, the four great kings report this to the Tāvatimsa devas when they meet and are sitting together in the Sudhamma council hall: 'Revered sirs, there are few people who behave properly toward their mother and father... and do meritorious deeds.' Then, because of this, the Tāvatimsa devas become displeased, [saying]: 'Alas, the celestial company will decline and the company of asuras will flourish!'

"But if there are many people who behave properly toward their mother and father... and do meritorious deeds, the four great kings report this to the Tāvatimsa devas when they meet and are sitting together in the Sudhamma council hall: 'Revered sirs, there are many people who behave properly toward their mother and father, behave properly toward ascetics and brahmins, honor the elders of the family, observe the uposatha, keep the extra observance days, and do meritorious deeds.' Then, because of this, the Tāvatimsa devas become elated, [saying]: 'Indeed, the celestial company will flourish and the company of asuras will decline!'"

"Bhikkhus, once in the past, when Sakka, ruler of the devas, was guiding the Tāvatimsa devas, he recited this verse: ${ }^{386}$ [144]

"The person who would be like me should observe the uposatha complete in the eight factors, on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight, and during special fortnights. ${ }^{387}$

"This verse, bhikkhus, was badly recited by Sakka, ruler of the devas, not well recited. It was badly stated, not well stated. For what reason? Because Sakka, ruler of the devas, is not devoid of lust, hatred, and delusion. But in the case of a bhikkhu who is an arahant-one whosefaints are destroyed, who has lived the
spiritual life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached his own goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, one completely liberated through final knowledge-it is fitting for him to say:

"The person who would be like me... and during special fortnights.'

"For what reason? Because that bhikkhu is devoid of lust, hatred, and delusion."

38 (8) Kings (2)

"Bhikkhus, once in the past, when Sakka, ruler of the devas, was guiding the Tāvatimsa devas, on that occasion he recited this verse: ${ }^{368}$

"The person who would be like me ... and during special fortnights.'

"This verse, bhikkhus, was badly recited by Sakka, ruler of the devas, not well recited. It was badly stated, not well stated. For what reason? Because Sakka, ruler of the devas, is not free from birth, old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish; he is not free from suffering, I say. But in the case of a bhikkhu who is an arahant-one whose taints are destroyed ... one completely liberated through final knowledge-it is fitting for him to say:

"The person who would be like me... and during special fortnights.' [145]

"For what reason? Because that bhikkhu is free from birth, old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish; he is free from suffering, I say."

# 39 (9) Delicate

"Bhikkhus, I was delicately nurtured, most delicately nurtured, extremely delicately nurtured. At my father's residence lotus ponds were made just for my enjoyment: in one of them blue lotuses bloomed, in another red lotuses, and in a third white
lotuses. ${ }^{389}$ I used no sandalwood unless it came from Kāsi and my headdress, jacket, lower garment, and upper garment were made of cloth from Kāsi. ${ }^{390}$ By day and by night a white canopy was held over me so that cold and heat, dust, grass, and dew would not settle on me.

"I had three mansions: one for the winter, one for the summer, and one for the rainy season. ${ }^{391}$ I spent the four months of the rains in the rainy-season mansion, being entertained by musicians, none of whom were male, ${ }^{392}$ and I did not leave the mansion. While in other people's homes slaves, workers, and servants are given broken rice together with sour gruel for their meals, in my father's residence they were given choice hill rice, meat, and boiled rice.

(1) "Amid such splendor and a delicate life, it occurred to me: 'An uninstructed worldling, though himself subject to old age, not exempt from old age, feels repelled, humiliated, and disgusted when he sees another who is old, overlooking his own situation. ${ }^{393}$ Now I too am subject to old age and am not exempt from old age. Such being the case, if I were to feel repelled, humiliated, [146] and disgusted when seeing another who is old, that would not be proper for me.' When I reflected thus, my intoxication with youth was completely abandoned.

(2) "[Again, it occurred to me:] 'An uninstructed worldling, though himself subject to illness, not exempt from illness, feels repelled, humiliated, and disgusted when he sees another who is ill, overlooking his own situation. Now I too am subject to illness and am not exempt from illness. Such being the case, if I were to feel repelled, humiliated, and disgusted when seeing another who is ill, that would not be proper for me.' When I reflected thus, my intoxication with health was completely abandoned.

(3) "[Again, it occurred to me:] 'An uninstructed worldling, though himself subject to death, not exempt from death, feels repelled, humiliated, and disgusted when he sees another who has died, overlooking his own situation. Now I too am subject to death and am not exempt from death. Such being the case, if I were to feel repelled, humiliated, and disgusted when seeing another who has died, that would not be proper for me.' When I reflected thus, my intoxication with life was completely abandoned.
"There are, bhikkhus, these three kinds of intoxication. ${ }^{394}$ What three? Intoxication with youth, intoxication with health, and intoxication with life. (1) An uninstructed worldling, intoxicated with youth, engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. (2) An uninstructed worldling, intoxicated with health, engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.

(3) An uninstructed worldling, intoxicated with life, engages in misconduct by body, [147] speech, and mind. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.

"Intoxicated with youth, a bhikkhu gives up the training and reverts to the lower life; or intoxicated with health, he gives up the training and reverts to the lower life; or intoxicated with life, he gives up the training and reverts to the lower life.

"Worldlings subject to illness, old age, and death, are disgusted [by other people] who exist in accordance with their nature. ${ }^{395}$

"If I were to become disgusted with beings who have such a nature, that would not be proper for me since I too have the same nature.

"While I was dwelling thus, having known the state without acquisitions, i overcame all intoxicationsintoxication with health, with youth, and with lifehaving seen security in renunciation. ${ }^{396}$

"Zeal then arose in me as I clearly saw nibbāna. Now I am incapable of indulging in sensual pleasures.

Relying on the spiritual life, never will I turn back." ${ }^{397}$

# 40 (10) Authorities

"Bhikkhus, there are these three authorities. What three? Oneself as one's authority, the world as one's authority, and the Dhamma as one's authority. ${ }^{398}$

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is oneself as one's authority? Here, having gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'I did not go forth from the household life into homelessness for the sake of a robe, almsfood, or lodging, or for the sake of becoming this or that, ${ }^{399}$ but rather [with the thought]: "I am immersed in birth, old age, and death; in sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish. I am immersed in suffering, afflicted by suffering. Perhaps an ending of this entire mass of suffering can be discerned." [148] As one who has gone forth from the household life into homelessness, it would not be proper for me to seek out sensual pleasures similar to or worse than those that I have discarded.' He then reflects thus: 'Energy will be aroused in me without slackening; mindfulness will be established without confusion; my body will be tranquil without disturbance; my mind will be concentrated and one-pointed.' Having taken himself as his authority, he abandons the unwholesome and develops the wholesome; he abandons what is blameworthy and develops what is blameless; he maintains himself in purity. This is called oneself as one's authority.

(2) "And what, bhikkhus, is the world as one's authority? Here, having gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'I did not go forth from the household life into homelessness for the sake of a robe...but rather [with the thought]: "I am immersed in birth, old age, and death...Perhaps an ending of this entire mass of suffering can be discerned." As one who has gone forth from the household life into homelessness, I might think sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill will, or thoughts of harming. But the abode of the world is vast. In the vast abode of the world there are ascetics and brahmins with psychizopotency and the divine eye who know the minds of others. They see things from a distance but they are not themselves seeneven when they're close; they know the
minds [of others] with their own mind. They would know me thus: "Look at this clansman: though he has gone forth from the household life into homelessness out of faith, he is tarnished by bad unwholesome states." There are deities, too, with psychic potency and the divine eye who know the minds of others. They see even from a distance but are not seen themselves even when close; they too know the minds [of others] with their own mind. They too would know me thus: "Look at this clansman: though he has gone forth from the household life into homelessness out of faith, he is tarnished by bad unwholesome states." He then reflects thus: 'Energy will be aroused in me [149] without slackening; mindfulness will be established without confusion; my body will be tranquil without disturbance; my mind will be concentrated and one-pointed.' Having taken the world as his authority, he abandons the unwholesome and develops the wholesome; he abandons what is blameworthy and develops what is blameless; he maintains himself in purity. This is called the world as one's authority.

(3) "And what, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma as one's authority? Here, having gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'I did not go forth from the household life into homelessness for the sake of a robe...but rather [with the thought]: "I am immersed in birth, old age, and death...Perhaps an ending of this entire mass of suffering can be discerned." The Dhamma' is well expounded by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise. There are fellow monks of mine who know and see. As one who has gone forth from the household life into homelessness in this well-expounded Dhamma and discipline, it would be improper for me to be lazy and heedless.' He then reflects thus: 'Energy will be aroused in me without slackening; mindfulness will be established without confusion; my body will be tranquil without disturbance; my mind will be concentrated and one-pointed.' Having taken the Dhamma as his authority, he abandons the unwholesome and develops the wholesome; he abandons what is blameworthy and develops what is blameless; he maintains himself in purity. This is called the Dhamma as one's authority.

"These, bhikkhus, are the three authorities."

For one performing an evil deed there is no place in the world called "hidden."

The self within you knows, O person, whether it is true or false. ${ }^{400}$

Indeed, sir, you the witness despise your good self; you conceal the evil self existing within yourself. ${ }^{401}$ [150]

The devas and Tathāgatas see the fool acting unrighteously in the world.

Therefore one should fare mindfully, taking oneself as authority; alert and meditative, taking the world as authority; and fare in accordance with the Dhamma, taking the Dhamma as authority.

Truly exerting himself, a sage does not decline.

Having vanquished Māra and overcome the end-maker, the striver has finished with birth.

Such a sage, wise, a world-knower, identifies with nothing at all. ${ }^{402}$

# V. The Minor Chapter

## 41 (1) Present

"Bhikkhus, when three things are present, a clansman endowed with faith generates much merit. What three? (1) When faith is present, a clansman endowed with faith generates much merit. (2) When an object to be given is present, a clansman endowed with faith generates much merit. (3) When those worthy of offerings are present, a clansman endowed with faith generates much merit. When these three things are present, a clansman endowed with faith generates much merit."

# 42 (2) Cases

"Bhikkhus, in three cases one may be understood to have faith and confidence. What three? When one desires to see those of virtuous behavior; when one desires to hear the good Dhamma; and when one dwells at home with a mind devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in relinquishment, devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing. In these three cases, one may be understood to have faith and confidence."

One who desires to see the virtuous ones, who wishes to hear the good Dhamma, who has removed the stain of miserliness, is called a person endowed with faith. [151]

## 43 (3) Advantages

"Bhikkhus, when one sees three advantages, it is enough to teach others the Dhamma. What three? (1) The one who teaches the Dhamma experiences the meaning and the Dhamma. ${ }^{433}$ (2) The one who hears the Dhamma experiences the meaning and the Dhamma. (3) Both the one who teaches the Dhamma and the one who hears the Dhamma experience the meaning and the Dhamma. Seeing these three advantages, it is enough to teach others the Dhamma."

## 44 (4) Smooth Flow

"Bhikkhus, in three cases talk flows smoothly. What three? (1) When the one who teaches the Dhamma experiences the meaning and the Dhamma. (2) When the one who hears the Dhamma experiences the meaning and the Dhamma. (3) When both the one who teaches the Dhamma and the one who hears the Dhamma experience the meaning and the Dhamma. In these three cases talk flows smoothly."

## 45 (5) The Wise

"Bhikkhus, there are these three things prescribed by the wise, prescribed by good people. What three? (1) Giving is prescribed by the wise, prescribed by good people. (2) The going forth is prescribed by the wise, prescribed by good people. (3) Attending upon one's mother and father is prescribed by the wise,
prescribed by good people. These three things are prescribed by the wise, prescribed by good people."

Good people prescribe giving, harmlessness, self-control, and self-taming, service to one's mother and father and to the peaceful followers of the spiritual life. ${ }^{404}$

These are the deeds of the good which the wise person should pursue.

The noble one possessed of vision goes to an auspicious world.

46 (6) Virtuous

"Bhikkhus, when virtuous renunciants dwell in dependence on a village or a town, the people there generate much merit in three ways. What three? [152] By body, speech, and mind. When virtuous renunciants dwell in dependence on a village or a town, the people there generate much merit in these three ways."

# 47 (7) Conditioned

"Bhikkhus, there are these three characteristics that define the conditioned. ${ }^{405}$ What three? An arising is seen, a vanishing is seen, and its alteration while it persists is seen. These are the three characteristics that define the conditioned.

"Bhikkhus, there are these three characteristics that define the unconditioned. ${ }^{406}$ What three? No arising is seen, no vanishing is seen, and no alteration while it persists is seen. These are the three characteristics that define the unconditioned."

## 48 (8) Mountains

"Bhikkhus, based on the Himalayas, the king of mountains, great sal trees grow in three ways. What three? (1) They grow in branches, leaves, and foliage; (2) they grow in bark and shoots; and (3) they grow in softwood and heartwood. Based on the Himalayas, the king of mountains, great sal trees grow in these three ways.

"So too, when the head of a family is endowed with faith, the people in the family who depend on him grow in three ways. What three? (1) They grow in faith; (2) they grow in virtuous
behavior; and (3) they grow in wisdom. When the head of a family is endowed with faith, the people in the family who depend on him grow in these three ways."

Just as the trees that grow in dependence on a rocky mountain in a vast forest wilderness might become great "woodland lords," so, when the head of a family here possesses faith and virtue, his wife, children, and relatives all grow in dependence upon him; so too his friends, his family circle, and those dependent on him. [153]

Those possessed of discernment; seeing that virtuous man's good conduct, his generosity and good deeds, emulate his example.

Having lived here in accord with Dhamma, the path leading to a good destination, those who desire sensual pleasures rejoice, delighting in the deva world.

49 (9) Ardor

"Bhikkhus, in three cases ardor should be exercised. What three? (1) Ardor should be exercised for the non-arising of unarisen bad unwholesome qualities. (2) Ardor should be exercised for the arising of unarisen wholesome qualities. (3) Ardor should be exercised for enduring arisen bodily feelings that are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, harrowing, disagreeable, sapping one's vitality. In these three cases ardor should be exercised.

"When a bhikkhu exercises ardor for the non-arising of unarisen bad unwholesome qualities, for the arising of unarisen wholesome qualities, and for enduring arisen bodily feelings that are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, harrowing, disagreeable, sapping one's vitality, he is called a bhikkhu who is ardent, alert, and mindful in order to make a complete end of suffering."

50 (10) A Master Thief

"Bhikkhus, possessing three factors, a master thief breaks into houses, plunders wealth, commits banditry, and ambushes highways. What three? Here, a master thief depends on the uneven, on thickets, and on powerful people.

(1) "And how does a master thief depend on the uneven? Here, a master thief depends on rivers that are hard to cross and rugged mountains. It is in this way that a master thief depends on the uneven.

(2) "And how does a master thief depend on thickets? Here; a master thief depends on a thicket of cane, [154] a thicket of trees, a coppice, ${ }^{407}$ or a large dense jungle. It is in this way that a master thief depends on thickets.

(3) "And how does a master thief depend on powerful people? Here, a master thief depends on kings or royal ministers. He thinks: 'If anyone accuses me of anything, these kings or royal ministers will dismiss the case.' If anyone accuses him of anything, those kings or royal ministers dismiss the case. It is in this way that a master thief depends on powerful people.

"It is by possessing these three factors that a master thief breaks into houses, plunders wealth, commits banditry, and ambushes highways.

"So too, bhikkhus, possessing three qualities, an evil bhikkhu maintains himself in a maimed and injured condition, is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise, and generates much demerit. What three? Here, an evil bhikkhu depends on the uneven, on thickets, and on powerful people.

(1) "And how does an evil bhikkhu depend on the uneven? Here, an evil bhikkhu engages in unrighteous bodily, verbal, and mental action. It is in this way that an evil bhikkhu depends on the uneven.

(2) "And how does an evil bhikkhu depend on thickets? Here, an evil bhikkhu holds wrong view, adopts an extremist view. It is in this way that an evil bhikkhu depends on thickets.

(3) "And how does an evil bhikkhu depend on powerful people? Here, an evil bhikkhu depends on kings or royal ministers. He thinks: 'If anyone accuses me of anything, these kings or royal ministers will dismiss the case.' If anyone accuses him of anything, those kings or royal ministers dismiss the case. It is in this way that an evil bhikkhu depends on the powerful. [155]
"It is by possessing these three qualities that an evil bhikkhu maintains himself in a maimed and injured condition, is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise, and generates much demerit."

# The Second Fifty

## I. Brahmins

## 51 (1) Two Brahmins (1)

Then two brahmins who were old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage, a hundred and twenty years of age, approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, they sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

"We are brahmins, Master Gotama, old, aged... a hundred and twenty years of age. But we have not done anything good and wholesome, nor have we made a shelter for ourselves. Let Master Gotama exhort us and instruct us in a way that will lead to our welfare and happiness for a long time!"

"Truly, brahmins, you are old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage, a hundred and twenty years of age, but you have not done anything good and wholesome, nor have you made a shelter for yourselves. Indeed, this world is swept away by old age, illness, and death. But though the world is swept away by old age, illness, and death, when one has departed, bodily, verbal, and mental self-control will provide a shelter, a harbor, an island, a refuge, and a support."

Life is swept along, short is the life span, no shelters exist for one who has grown old. Seeing clearly this peril in death, one should do deeds of merit that bring happiness. ${ }^{408}$

When one departs [this life], self-control over body, speech, and mind, and the deeds of merit one did while living, lead to one's happiness. [156]

52 (2) Two Brahmins (2)

Then two brahmins who were old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage, a hundred and twenty years of age, approached the Blessed One... and said to him:

"We are brahmins, Master Gotama, old, aged... a hundred and twenty years of age. But we have not done anything good and wholesome, nor have we made a shelter for ourselves. Let Master Gotama exhort us and instruct us in a way that will lead to our welfare and happiness for a long time!"

"Truly, brahmins, you are old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage, a hundred and twenty years of age, but you have not done anything good and wholesome, nor have you made a shelter for yourselves. Indeed, this world is burning with old age, illness, and death. But though the world is burning with old age, illness, and death, when one has departed, bodily, verbal, and mental self-control will provide a shelter, a harbor, an island, a refuge, and a support."

When one's house is ablaze the vessel taken out is the one that will be useful to you, not the one that is burnt inside.

So since the world is ablaze with old age and death, one should take out by giving: what is given is well taken out. ${ }^{409}$

When one departs [this life], self-control over body, speech, and mind, and the deeds of merit one did while alive, lead to one's happiness.

# 53 (3) A Certain Brahmin

Then a certain brahmin approached the Blessed One... and said to him:

"Master Gotama, it is said: 'A directly visible Dhamma, a directly visible Dhamma. ${ }^{410}$ In what way is the Dhamma directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise?"
(1) "Brahmin, one excited by lust, overcome by lust, with mind obsessed by it, [157] intends for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, and for the affliction of both, and he experiences mental suffering and dejection. But when lust is abandoned, he does not intend for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, or for the affliction of both, and he does not experience mental suffering and dejection. It is in this way that the Dhamma is directly visible....

(2) "One full of hate, overcome by hatred, with mind obsessed by it, intends for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, and for the affliction of both, and he experiences mental suffering and dejection. But when hatred is abandoned, he does not intend for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, or for the affliction of both, and he does not experience mental suffering and dejection. It is in this way, too, that the Dhamma is directly visible....

(3) "One who is deluded, overcome by delusion, with mind obsessed by it, intends for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, and for the affliction of both, and he experiences mental suffering and dejection. But when delusion is abandoned, he does not intend for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, or for the affliction of both, and he does not experience mental suffering and dejection. It is in this way, too, that the Dhamma is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise."

"Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the darkness so those with good eyesight can see forms. I now go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

# 54 (4) A Wanderer

Then a certain brahmin wanderer approached the Blessed One ... and said to him:

"Master Gotama; it is said: 'A directly visible Dhamma, a directly visible Dhamma.' In what way is the Dhamma directly
visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise?"

(1) "Brahmin, one excited by lust, overcome by lust, with mind obsessed by it, intends for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, or for the affliction of both, and he experiences mental suffering and dejection. But when lust is abandoned, he does not intend for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, or for the affliction of both, and he does not experience mental suffering and dejection. [158] One excited by lust, overcome by lust, with mind obsessed by it, engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when lust is abandoned, he does not engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. One excited by lust, overcome by lust, with mind obsessed by it, does not understand as it really is his own good, the good of others, or the good of both. But when lust is abandoned, he understands as it really is his own good, the good of others, and the good of both. It is in this way, brahmin, that the Dhamma is directly visible ... to be personally experienced by the wise.

(2) "One full of hate, overcome by hatred...

(3) "One who is deluded, overcome by delusion, with mind obsessed by it, intends for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, or for the affliction of both, and he experiences mental suffering and dejection. But when delusion is abandoned, he does not intend for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, or for the affliction of both, and he does not experience mental suffering and dejection. One who is deluded, overcome by delusion, with mind obsessed by it, engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when delusion is abandoned, he does not engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. One who is deluded, overcome by delusion, with mind obsessed by it, does not understand as it really is his own good, the good of others, or the good of both. But when delusion is abandoned, he understands as it really is his own good, the good of others, and the good of both. It is in this way, too, that the Dhamma is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise."

"Excellent, Master Gotama!...Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

55 (5) Nibbāna

Then the brahmin Jānussonī approached the Blessed One ... and said to him:

"Master Gotama, it is said: 'Directly visible nibbāna, directly visible nibbāna.' In what way is nibbāna directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise?" [159]

(1) "Brahmin, one excited by lust, overcome by lust, with mind obsessed by it, intends for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, or for the affliction of both, and he experiences mental suffering and dejection. But when lust is abandoned, he does not intend for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, or for the affliction of both, and he does not experience mental suffering and dejection. It is in this way that nibbāna is directly visible.

(2) "One full of hate, overcome by hatred...

(3) "One who is deluded, overcome by delusion, with mind obsessed by it, intends for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, or for the affliction of both, and he experiences mental suffering and dejection. But when delusion is abandoned, he does not intend for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, or for the affliction of both, and he does not experience mental suffering and dejection. It is in this way, too, that nibbāna is directly visible.

"When, brahmin, one experiences the remainderless destruction of lust, the remainderless destruction of hatred, and the remainderless destruction of delusion, it is in this way, too, that nibbāna is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise."

"Excellent, Master Gotama!... Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

# 56 (6) Depopulation

Then a certain affluent brahmin approached the Blessed One ... and said to him:

"Master Gotama, I have heard older brahmins who are aged, burdened with years, teachers of teachers, saying: 'In the past this world was so thickly populated one would think there
was no space between people. The villages, towns, and capital cities were so close that cocks could fly between them. ${ }^{141}$ Why is it, Master Gotama, that at present the number of people has declined, depopulation is seen, ${ }^{412}$ and villages, [160] towns, cities, and districts have vanished?"413

(1) "At present, brahmin, people are excited by illicit lust, overcome by unrighteous greed, afflicted by wrong Dhamma. ${ }^{414}$ As a result, they take up weapons and slay one another. Hence many people die. This is a reason why at present the number of people has declined, depopulation is seen, and villages, towns, cities, and districts have vanished.

(2) "Again, at present people are excited by illicit lust, overcome by unrighteous greed, afflicted by wrong Dhamma. When this happens, 'sufficient rain does not fall. As a result, there is a famine, a scarcity of grain; the crops become blighted and turn to straw. Hence many people die. This is another reason why at present the number of people has declined, depopulation is seen, and villages, towns, cities, and districts have vanished.

(3) "Again, at present people are excited by illicit lust, overcome by unrighteous greed, afflicted by wrong Dhamma. When this happens, the yakkhas release wild spirits. ${ }^{415}$ Hence many people die. This is yet another reason why at present the number of people has declined, depopulation is seen, and villages, towns, cities, and districts have vanished."

"Excellent, Master Gotama!...Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

# 57 (7) Vaccha

Then the wanderer Vacchagotta approached the Blessed One ... and said to him:

"Master Gotama, I have heard: 'The ascetic Gotama says: "Alms should be given only to me, [161] not to others; alms should be given only to my disciples, not to the disciples of others. Only what is given to me is very fruitful, not what is given to others; only what is given to my disciples is very fruitful, not what is given to the disciples of others." Do those who speak thus state what has been said by Master Gotama and not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact? Do they explain in accordance with the Dhamma so that they would not incur
any reasonable criticism or ground for censure? ${ }^{416}$ For we do not want to misrepresent Master Gotama."

"Those, Vaccha, who say: 'The ascetic Gotama says: "Alms should be given only to me . . . only what is given to my disciples is very fruitful, not what is given to the disciples of others,"' do not state what has been said by me but misrepresent me with what is untrue and contrary to fact. One who prevents another from giving alms creates an obstruction and stumbling block for three people. What three? He creates an obstruction to the donor's acquiring merit, to the recipients' gaining a gift, and already he has maimed and injured himself. One who prevents another from giving alms creates an obstruction and stumbling block for these three people.

"But, Vaccha, I say that one acquires merit even if one throws away dishwashing water in a refuse dump or cesspit with the thought: 'May the living beings here sustain themselves with this!' How much more, then, [does one acquire merit] when one gives to human beings! However, I say that what is given to one of virtuous behavior is more fruitful than [what is given] to an immoral person. And [the most worthy recipient] is one who has abandoned five factors and possesses five factors.

"What five factors has he abandoned? Sensual desire, ill will, dullness [162] and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. These are the five factors that he has abandoned.

"And what five factors does he possess? The virtuous behavior, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and knowledge and vision of liberation of one beyond training. These are the five factors that he possesses.

"It is in such a way, I say, that what is given to one who has abandoned five factors and possesses five factors is very fruitful."

Among cattle of any sort, whether black, white, red, or golden, mottled, uniform, or pigeon-colored, the tamed bull is born, the one that can bear the load, possessing strength, advancing with good speed. They yoke the burden just to him; they are not concerned about his color.

So too, among human beings

it is in any kind of birth-

among khattiyas, brahmins, vessas,

suddas, caṇdālas, or scavengers-

among people of any sort

that the tamed person of good manners is born:

one firm in Dhamma, virtuous in conduct,

truthful in speech, endowed with moral shame;

one who has abandoned birth and death,

consummate in the spiritual life,

with the burden dropped, detached,

who has done his task, free of taints;

who has gone beyond all things [of the world]

and by non-clinging has reached nibbāna:

an offering is truly vast

when planted in that spotless field.

Fools devoid of understanding,

dull-witted, unlearned,

do not attend on the holy ones ${ }^{417}$

but give their gifts to those outside.

Those, however, who attend on the holy ones,

on the wise ones esteemed as sagely, ${ }^{418}$

and those whose faith in the Fortunate One

is deeply rooted and well established,

go to the world of the devas

or are born here in a good family.

Advancing in successive steps,

those wise ones attain nibbāna. [163]

# 58.(8) Tikaṇna

Then the brahmin Tikaṇna approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him.... Then, sitting to one side, the brahmin Tikaṇna, in the presence of the Blessed One, spoke praise of the brahmins who had mastered the threefold knowledge: "Such are the brahmins who are masters of the threefold knowledge; thus are the brahmins who are masters of the threefold knowledge."

[The Blessed One said:] "But how, brahmin, do the brahmins describe a brahmin who is a master of the threefold knowledge?"
"Here, Master Gotama, a brahmin is well born on both his maternal and paternal sides, of pure descent, unassailable and impeccable with respect to birth as far back as the seventh paternal generation. He is a reciter and preserver of the hymns, a master of the three Vedas with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology, and etymology, and the histories as a fifth; skilled in philology and grammar, he is fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a great man. It is in this way that the brahmins describe a brahmin who is a master of the threefold knowledge."

"Brahmin, a master of the threefold knowledge in the Noble One's discipline is quite different from a brahmin who is a master of the threefold knowledge as the brahmins describe him."

"But in what way, Master Gotama, is one a master of the threefold knowledge in the Noble One's discipline? It would be good if Master Gotama would teach me the Dhamma in such a way as to make clear how one is a master of the threefold knowledge in the Noble One's discipline."

"Well then, brahmin, listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, sir," the brahmin Tikaṇṇa replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Here, brahmin, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. With the subsiding of thought and examination, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration, without thought and examination. With the fading away as well of rapture, he dwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, he experiences pleasure with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: 'He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.' With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection; [164] he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity.

(1) "When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, cleansed, unblemished, rid of defilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and
attained to imperturbability, he directs it to the knowledge of the recollection of past abodes. He recollects his manifold past abodes, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births; five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many eons of world-dissolution, many eons of world-evolution, many eons of world-dissolution and worldevolution, thus: 'There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere, and there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn here.' Thus he recollects his manifold past abodes with their aspects and details.

"This is the first true knowledge attained by him. Ignorance is dispelled, true knowledge has arisen; darkness is dispelled, light has arisen, as happens when one dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute.

(2) "When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, cleansed; unblemished, rid of defilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs it to the knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings. With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the hưman, he sees beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma thus: 'These beings who engaged in misconduct by body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong view, and undertook kamma based on wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; but these beings who engaged in good conduct by body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right [165] view, and undertook kamma based on right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.' Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma.
"This is the second true knowledge attained by him. Ignorance is dispelled, true knowledge has arisen; darkness is dispelled, light has arisen, as happens when one dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute.

(3) "When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, cleansed, unblemished, rid of defilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs it to the knowledge of the destruction of the taints. He understands as it really is: 'This is suffering'; he understands as it really is: 'This is the origin of suffering'; he understands as it really is: 'This is the cessation of suffering'; he understands as it really is: 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' He understands as it really is: 'These are the taints'; he understands as it really is: 'This is the origin of the taints'; he understands as it really is: 'This is the cessation of the taints'; he understands as it really is: 'This is the way leading to the cessation of the taints.'

"When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint of sensuality, from the taint of existence, and from the taint of ignorance. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: '[It's] liberated.' He understands: 'Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.'

"This is the third true knowledge attained by him. Ignorance is dispelled, true knowledge has arisen; darkness is dispelled, light has arisen, as happens when one dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute.

"He whose virtue has no vacillation, who is alert and meditative, whose mind has been mastered, one-pointed, well concentrated;

"the wise one, dispeller of darkness, the triple-knowledge bearer, victor over death; the one they call an abandoner of all, benefactor of devas and humans;

"the one possessing the three knowledges, who dwells without delusion; they worship him, the Buddha Gotama, bearing his final body.
"One who knows his past abodes, who sees heaven and the plane of misery, and has reached the destruction of birth is a sage consummate in direct knowledge. ${ }^{419}$

"Through these three kinds of knowledge one is a triple-knowledge brahmin. I call him a triple-knowledge master, not the other who utters incantations. [166]

"It is in this way, brahmin, that one is a master of the threefold knowledge in the Noble One's discipline."

"Master Gotama, a master of the threefold knowledge in the Noble One's discipline is quite different from a master of the threefold knowledge according to the brahmins. And a master of the threefold knowledge according to the brahmins is not worth a sixteenth part of a master of the threefold knowledge in the Noble One's discipline.

"Excellent, Master Gotama!... Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

# 59 (9) JānuSSOṇ̄̄

Then the brahmin Jāṇussonī approached the Blessed One... and said to him:

"Master Gotama, whoever has a sacrifice, a memorial meal, an offering dish, or something to be given should give the gift to brahmins who are masters of the threefold knowledge." ${ }^{420}$

[The Blessed One said:] "But how, brahmin, do the brahmins describe a brahmin who is a master of the threefold knowledge?"

"Here, Master Gotama, a brahmin is well born on both sides... [as in 3:58]... and [skilled] in the marks of a great man. It is in this way that the brahmins describe a master of the threefold knowledge."

"Brahmin, a master of the threefold knowledge in the Noble One's discipline is'quite different from the one that the brahmins describe."

"But in what. way, Master Gotama, is one a master of the threefold knowledge in the Noble One's discipline? It would be good if Master Gotama would teach me the Dhamma in such
a way as to make clear how one is a master of the threefold knowledge in the Noble One's discipline."

"Well then, brahmin, listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, sir," the brahmin Jannusson̄ replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Here, brahmin, secluded from sensual pleasures... [all as in 3:58, down to:] [167]...This is the third true knowledge attained by him. Ignorance is dispelled, true knowledge has arisen; darkness is dispelled, light has arisen, as happens when one dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute.

"One consummate in virtue and observances, who is resolute and composed, whose mind has been mastered, one-pointed and well concentrated;

"one who knows his past abodes, who sees heaven and the plane of misery, and has reached the destruction of birth is a sage consummate in direct knowledge. [168]

"Through these three kinds of knowledge one is a triple-knowledge brahmin. I call him a triple-knowledge master, not the other who utters incantations.

"It is in this way, brahmin, that one is a master of the threefold knowledge in the Noble One's discipline."

"A master of the threefold knowledge in the Noble One's discipline, Master Gotama, is quite different from a master of the threefold knowledge according to the brahmins. And a master of the threefold knowledge according to the brahmins is not worth a sixteenth part of a master of the threefold knowledge in the Noble One's discipline.

"Excellent, Master Gotama!... Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

60 (10) Sangärava

Then the brahmin Sangārava approached the Blessed One and excna:ged greetings with him.... Then, sitting to one side, the brahmin Sangārava said this to the Blessed One:
"Master Gotama, we brahmins sacrifice and enjoin others to offer sacrifices. Now both one who himself sacrifices and one who enjoins others to offer sacrifices engage in a meritorious practice that extends to many people, that is, one based on sacrifice. But one who leaves his family and goes forth from the household life into homelessness tames only himself, calms only himself, and leads to nibbāna only himself. In such a case, he engages in a meritorious practice that extends to only one person, that is, one based on going forth."

"Well then, brahmin, I will question you about this matter. You should answer as you see fit. What do you think, brahmin? Here, a Tathāgata arises in the world, an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, an Enlightened One, a Blessed One. He says thus: 'Come, this is the path, this is the way. Practicing in accordance with it, I have realized for myself with direct knowledge the unsurpassed culmination of the spiritual life ${ }^{421}$ and make it known to others. Come, you too practice thus. Practicing in accordance with it, you too will realize for yourselves with direct knowledge the unsurpassed culmination of the spiritual life and dwell in it.' Thus the teacher teaches this Dhamma and others [169] practice accordingly. There are many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands who do so. What do you think? When this is the case, is that act of going forth a meritorious practice that extends to one person or to many people?"

"When that is the case, Master Gotama, this is a meritorious practice that extends to many people, that is, one based on going forth."

When this was said, the Venerable Ānanda said to the brahmin Sangārava: "Of these two practices, brahmin, which appeals to you more as being simpler and less harmful, and as being more fruitful and beneficial?"

Thereupon the brahmin Sangārava said to the Venerable Ānanda: "I consider Master Gotama and Master Ānanda worthy of veneration and praise. ${ }^{\prime 422}$

A second time the Venerable Ānanda said to the brahmin: "Brahmin, I am not asking you whom you consider worthy of veneration and praise. I am asking you which of those two
practices appeals to you as being simpler and less harmful, and also as more fruitful and beneficial?"

But a second time the brahmin Sangārava replied: "I consider Master Gotama and Master Ānanda worthy of veneration and praise."

A third time the Venerable Ānanda said to the brahmin: "Brahmin, I am not asking you whom you consider worthy of veneration and praise. I am asking you which of those two practices appeals to you as being simpler and less harmful, and also as more fruitful and beneficial?"

But a third time the brahmin Sangārava replied: "I consider Master Gotama and Master Ānanda worthy of veneration and praise." [170]

Then the Blessed One thought: "Even for a third time the brahmin Sangārava, on being asked a legitimate question by Ānanda, falters and does not answer. Let me release him." Then the Blessed One said to the brahmin Sangārava: "What conversation, brahmin, arose today among the king's retinue when they assembled and were sitting in the royal palace?"

"The conversation was this, Master Gotama: 'Formerly there were fewer bhikkhus, but more who displayed superhuman wonders of psychic potency. But now there are more bhikkhus, but fewer who display superhuman wonders of psychic potency.' This was the conversation that arose today among the king's retinue."

"There are, brahmin, these three kinds of wonders. What three? The wonder of psychic potency, the wonder of mindreading, and the wonder of instruction. ${ }^{423}$.

(1) "And what, brahmin, is the wonder of psychic potency? Here, a bhikkhu wields the various kinds of psychic potency: having been one, he becomes many; having been many, he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he goes unhindered through a wall, through a rampart, through a mountain as though through space; he dives in and out of the earth as though it were water; he walks on water without sinking as though it were earth; seated cross-legged, he travels in space like a bird; with his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; he exercises mastery with the body as far as the brahmā world. This is called the wonder of psychic potency.

(2) "And what, brahmin, is the wonder of mind-reading?

There is one who, by means of some clue, ${ }^{424}$ declares: 'Your thought is thus, such is what you are thinking, your mind is in such and such a state.' And even if he makes many declarations, they are exactly so and not otherwise.

"Again, someone does not declare [the state of mind] on the basis of a clue, [171] but he hears the sound of people, spirits, or deities [speaking] and then declares: 'Your thought is thus, such is what you are thinking, your mind is in such and such a state.' And even if he makes many declarations, they are exactly so and not otherwise.

"Again, someone does not declare [the state of mind] on the basis of a mark, or by hearing the sound of people, spirits, or deities [speaking], but he hears the sound of the diffusion of thought ${ }^{425}$ as one is thinking and examining [some matter] and then declares: 'Your thought is thus, such is what you are thinking, your mind is in such and such a state.' And even if he makes many declarations, they are exactly so and not otherwise.

"Again, someone does not declare [the state of mind] on the basis of a mark, or by hearing the sound of people, spirits, or deities [speaking], or by hearing the sound of the diffusion of thought as one is thinking and examining [some matter], but with his own mind he encompasses the mind of one who has attained concentration without thought and examination and he understands: 'This person's mental activities are so disposed that immediately afterward he will think this thought. ${ }^{426}$ And even if he makes many declarations, they are exactly so and not otherwise. This is called the wonder of mind-reading.

(3) "And what, brahmin, is the wonder of instruction? Here, someone instructs [others] thus: 'Think in this way and not in that way! Attend to this and not to that! Abandon this and enter and dwell in that!' This is called the wonder of instruction. ${ }^{427}$

"These, brahmin; are the three kinds of wonders. Of these three wonders, which appeals to you as the most excellent and sublime?"

"Among these, Master Gotama, when someone performs this wonder by which he wields the various kinds of psychic potency ... exercises mastery with the body as far as the brahmā world, only the one who performs this wonder experiences it and it occurs only to him. This wonder seems to me like a magical trick.
"Again, Master Gotama, when someone performs this wonder by which he declares another's state of mind on the basis of a clue...by hearing the sound of people, spirits, or deities...by hearing the sound of the diffusion of thought while he is thinking and examining [some matter]...by encompassing with his own mind the mind of one who has attained concentration that is without thought and examination such that he understands: [172] 'This person's mental activities are so disposed that immediately afterward he will think this thought,' and, even if he makes many declarations, they are exactly so and not otherwise-again, only the one who performs this wonder experiences it and it occurs only to him. This wonder, too, seems to me like a magical trick.

"But, Master Gotama, when someone performs this wonder by which he instructs [others] thus: 'Think in this way and not in that way! Attend to this and not to that! Abandon this and enter and dwell in that!'-this wonder appeals to me as the most excellent and sublime of those three wonders.

"It is astounding and amazing, Master Gotama, how well this has been stated by Master Gotama! We consider Master Gotama to be one who can perform these three wonders. For Master Gotama wields the various kinds of psychic potency ... exercises mastery with the body as far as the brahmā world. Master Gotama encompasses with his own mind the mind of one who has attained concentration that is without thought and examination such that he understands: 'This person's mental activities are so disposed that immediately afterward he will think this thought.' And Master Gotama instructs [others] thus: 'Think in this way and not in that way! Attend to this and not to that! Abandon this and enter and dwell in that!'"

"Surely, brahmin, your words are prying and intrusive. ${ }^{428}$ Nevertheless, I will answer you. I do wield the various kinds of psychic potency... exercise mastery with the body as far as the brahmā world. I do encompass with my own mind the mind of one who has attained a state of concentration that is without thought and examination such that I understand: 'This person's mental activities are so disposed that immediately afterward he will think this thought.' And I do instruct [others] thus: 'Think in this way and not in that way! Attend to this and not to that! Abandon this and enter and dwell in that!'"
"But, Master Gotama, is there even one other bhikkhu apart from Master Gotama who can perform these three wonders?"

"There is not just one hundred, two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, or five hundred bhikkhus, but even more who can perform these three wonders."

"But where are those bhikkhus presently dwelling?" [173]

"Right here, brahmin, in this Sangha of bhikkhus."

"Excellent, Master Gotama!...Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

# II. The Great Chapter

61 (1) Sectarian

"Bhikkhus, there are these three sectarian tenets ${ }^{429}$ which, when questioned, interrogated, and cross-examined by the wise, and taken to their conclusion, will eventuate in non-doing. ${ }^{430}$ What are the three?

(1) "There are, bhikkhus, some ascetics and brahmins who hold such a doctrine and view as this: 'Whatever this person experiences-whether pleasure, pain, or neither-pain-nor-pleasure-all that is caused by what was done in the past.' (2) There are other ascetics and brahmins who hold such a doctrine and view as this: 'Whatever this person experiences-whether pleasure, pain, or neither-pain-nor-pleasure-all that is caused by God's creative activity.' (3) And there are still other ascetics and brahmins who hold such a doctrine and view as this: 'Whatever this person experiences-whether pleasure, pain, or neither-pain-nor-pleasure-all that occurs without a cause or condition. ${ }^{431}$

(1) "Bhikkhus, I approached those ascetics and brahmins who hold such a doctrine and view as this: 'Whatever this person experiences-whether pleasure, pain, or neither-pain-nor-pleasure-all that is caused by past deeds, ${ }^{432}$ and I said to them: 'Is it true that you venerable ones hold such a doctrine and view?' When I ask them this, they affirm it. [174] Then I say to them: 'In such a case, it is due to past deeds that you might destroy life, take what is not given, indulge in sexual activity, speak falsehood, utter divisive speech, speak harshly, indulge in idle chatter; that you might be full of longing, have a mind of ill will, and hold wrong view. ${ }^{133}$
"Those who fall back on past deeds as the essential truth have no desire [to do] what should be done and [to avoid doing] what should not be done, nor do they make an effort in this respect. Since they do not apprehend as true and valid anything that should be done or should not be done, they are muddleminded, they do not guard themselves, and even the personal designation 'ascetic' could not be legitimately applied to them. This was my first legitimate refutation of those ascetics and brahmins who hold such a doctrine and view.

(2) "Then, bhikkhus, I approached those ascetics and brahmins who hold such a doctrine and view as this: 'Whatever this person experiences-whether pleasure, pain, or neither-pain-nor-pleasure-all that is caused by God's creative activity,' and I said to them: 'Is it true that you venerable ones hold such a doctrine and view?' When I ask them this, they affirm it. Then I say to them: 'In such a case, it is due to God's creative activity that you might destroy life ... and hold wrong view.'

"Those who fall back on God's creative activity as the essential truth have no desire [to do] what should be done and [to avoid doing] what should not be done, nor do they make an effort in this respect. Since they do not apprehend as true and valid anything that should be done or should not be done, they are muddle-minded, they do not guard themselves, and even the personal designation 'ascetic' could not be legitimately applied to them. This was my second legitimate refutation of those ascetics and brahmins who hold such a doctrine and view. [175]

(3) "Then, bhikkhus, I approached those ascetics and brahmins who hold such a doctrine and view as this: 'Whatever this person experiences-whether pleasure, pain, or neither-pain-nor-pleasure-all that occurs without a cause or condition,' and I said to them: 'Is it true that you venerable ones hold such a doctrine and view?' When I ask them this, they affirm it. Then I say to them: 'In such a case, it is without a cause or condition that you might destroy life ... and hold wrong view.'

"Those who fall back on absence of cause and condition as the essential truth have no desire [to do] what should be done and [to avoid doing] what should not be done, nor do they make an effort in this respect. Since they do not apprehend as true and valid anything that should be done or should not be done,
they are muddle-minded, they do not guard themselves, and even the personal designation 'ascetic' could not be legitimately applied to them. This was my third legitimate refutation of those ascetics and brahmins who hold such a doctrine and view.

"These, bhikkhus, are the three sectarian tenets which, when questioned, interrogated, and cross-examined by the wise, and taken to their conclusion, will eventuate in non-doing.

"But, bhikkhus, this Dhamma taught by me is unrefuted, undefiled, irreproachable, and uncensured by wise ascetics and brahmins. ${ }^{434}$ And what is the Dhamma taught by me that is unrefuted, undefiled, irreproachable, and uncensured by wise ascetics and brahmins?

"These are the six elements': this, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma taught by me that is unrefuted... uncensured by wise ascetics and brahmins. 'These are the six bases for contact'...'These are the eighteen mental examinations'...'These are the four noble truths': this, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma taught by me that is unrefuted, undefiled, irreproachable, and uncensured by wise ascetics and brahmins.

"When it was said: "These are the six elements": this, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma taught by me that is unrefuted... uncensured by wise ascetics and brahmins,' for what reason was this said? There are [176] these six elements: the earth element, the water element, the fire element, the air element, the space element, and the consciousness element. ${ }^{435}$ When it was said: ""These are the six elements": this, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma taught by me that is unrefuted... uncensured by wise ascetics and brahmins,' it is because of this that this was said.

"When it was said: ""These are the six bases for contact": this, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma taught by me that is unrefuted... uncensured by wise ascetics and brahmins,' for what reason was this said? There are these six bases for contact: the eye as a base for contact, the ear as a base for contact, the nose as a base for contact, the tongue as a base for contact, the body as a base for contact, and the mind as a base for contact. When it was said: ""These are the six bases for contact": this, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma taught by me that is unrefuted... uncensured by wise ascetics and brahmins,' it is because of this that this was said.

"When it was said: "These are the eighteen mental exami-
nations": this, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma taught by me that is unrefuted...uncensured by wise ascetics and brahmins,' for what reason was this said? ${ }^{436}$ Having seen a form with the eye, one examines a form that is a basis for joy; one examines a form that is a basis for dejection; one examines a form that is a basis for equanimity. Having heard a sound with the ear...Having smelled an odor with the nose...Having tasted a taste with the tongue...Having felt a tactile object with the body...Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, one examines a mental phenomenon that is a basis for joy; one examines a mental phenomenon that is a basis for dejection; one examines a mental phenomenon that is a basis for equanimity. When it was said: '"These are the eighteen mental examinations": this, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma taught by me that is unrefuted...uncensured by wise ascetics and brahmins,' it is because of this that this was said.

"When it was said: "These are the four noble truths": this, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma taught by me that is unrefuted...uncensured by wise ascetics and brahmins,' for what reason was this said? In dependence on the six elements the descent of a [future] embryo occurs. ${ }^{437}$ When the descent takes place, there is name-and-form; with name-and-form as condition, there are the six sense bases; with the six sense bases as condition, there is contact; with contact as condition, there is feeling. Now it is for one who feels that I proclaim: 'This is suffering,' and 'This is the origin of suffering,' and 'This is the cessation of suffering,' and 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.'

"And what, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of suffering? Birth is suffering, old age is suffering, illness is suffering, death [177] is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish are suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering; in brief, the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering. This is called the noble truth of suffering.

"And what, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering? With ignorance as condition, volitional activities [come to be]; with volitional activities as condition, consciousness; with consciousness as condition, name-and-form; with name-and-form as condition, the six sense bases; with the six sense bases as condition, contact; with contact as condition,
feeling; with feeling as condition, craving; with craving as condition, clinging; with clinging as condition, existence; with existence as condition, birth; with birth as condition, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish come to be. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering. This is called the noble truth of the origin of suffering. ${ }^{436}$

"And what, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering? With the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional activities; with the cessation of volitional activities, cessation of consciousness; with the cessation of consciousness, cessation of name-andform; with the cessation of name-and-form, cessation of the six sense bases; with the cessation of the six sense bases, cessation of contact; with the cessation of contact, cessation of feeling; with the cessation of feeling, cessation of craving; with the cessation of craving, cessation of clinging; with the cessation of clinging, cessation of existence; with the cessation of existence, cessation of birth; with the cessation of birth, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish cease. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering. This is called the noble truth of the cessation of suffering.

"And what, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering? It is just this noble eightfold path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. This is called the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering.

"When it was said: ""These are the four noble truths": this, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma taught by me that is unrefuted, undefiled, irreproachable, and uncensured by wise ascetics and brahmins,' it is because of this that this was said." [178]

# 62 (2) Perils

"Bhikkhus, the uninstructed worldling speaks of these three perils that separate mother and son. ${ }^{439}$ What three?

(1) "There comes a time when a great conflagration arises. When the great conflagration has arisen; it burns up villages, towns, and cities. When villages, towns, and cities are burning up, the mother does not find her son and the son does not find his mother. This is the first peril that separates mother and son of which the uninstructed-wordling speaks.
(2) "Again, there comes a time when a great rain cloud arises. When the great rain cloud has arisen, a great deluge takes place. When the great deluge takes place, villages, towns, and cities are swept away. When villages, towns, and cities are being swept away, the mother does not find her son and the son does not find his mother. This is the second peril that separates mother and son of which the uninstructed worldling speaks.

(3) "Again, there comes a time of perilous turbulence in the wilderness, when the people of the countryside, mounted on their vehicles, flee on all sides. When there is perilous turbulence in the wildemess, and the people of the countryside, mounted on their vehicles, are fleeing on all sides, the mother does not find her son and the son does not find his mother. This is the third peril that separates mother and son of which the uninstructed worldling speaks.

"These are the three perils that separate mother and son of which the uninstructed worldling speaks.

"There are, bhikkhus, these three perils when mother and son reconnect that the uninstructed worldling speaks of as perils that separate mother and son. ${ }^{40}$ What three?

(1) "There comes a time when a great conflagration arises. When the great conflagration has arisen, it burns up villages, towns, and cities. When villages, towns, and cities are burning up, there is sometimes an occasion when the mother [179] finds her son and the son finds his mother. This is the first peril when mother and son reconnect that the uninstructed worldling speaks of as a peril that separates mother and son.

(2) "Again, there comes a time when a great rain cloud arises. When the great rain cloud has arisen, a great deluge takes place. When the great deluge takes place, villages, towns, and cities are swept away. When villages, towns, and cities are being swept away, there is sometimes an occasion when the mother finds her son and the son finds his mother. This is the second peril when mother and son reconnect that the uninstructed worldling speaks of as a peril that separates mother and son.

(3) "Again, there comes a time of perilous turbulence in the wilderness, when the people of the countryside, mounted on their vehicles, flee on all sides. When there is perilous turbulence in the wilderness, and the people of the countryside, mounted on their vehicles, are fleeing on all sides, there is sometimes an occasion when the mother finds her son and the
son finds his mother. This is the third peril when mother and son reconnect that the uninstructed worldling speaks of as a peril that separates mother and son.

"These are the three perils when mother and son reconnect that the uninstructed worldling speak of as perils that separate mother and son.

"There are, bhikkhus, these three perils that separate mother and son. ${ }^{411}$ What three? The peril of old age, the peril of illness, and the peril of death.

(1) "When the son is growing old, the mother cannot fulfill her wish: 'Let me grow old, but may my son not grow old!' And when the mother is growing old, the son cannot fulfill his wish: 'Let me grow old, but may my mother not grow old!'

(2) "When the son has fallen ill, the mother cannot fulfill her wish: 'Let me fall ill, but may my son not fall ill!' And when the mother has fallen ill, the son cannot fulfill his wish: 'Let me fall ill, but may my mother not fall ill!'

(3) "When the son is dying, the mother cannot fulfill her wish: 'Let me die, but may my son not die!' And when the mother is dying, the son cannot fulfill his wish: 'Let me die, but may my mother not die!'

"These are the three perils that separate mother and son. [180]

"There is a path, bhikkhus, there is a way that leads to the abandoning and overcoming of these three perils when mother and son reconnect and of these three perils that separate mother and son. And what is the path and way? It is just this noble eightfold path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. This is the path and way that leads to the abandoning and overcoming of these three perils when mother and son reconnect and of these three perils that separate mother and son."

# 63 (3) Venāga

On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Sangha of bhikkhus when he reached the Kosalan brahmin village named Venāgapura. The brahmin householders of Venāgapura heard: "It is said that the ascetic Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a

Sakyan family, has arrived at Venāgapura. Now a good report about that Master Gotama has circulated thus: 'That Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One. Having realized by his own direct knowledge this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, he makes it known to others. He teaches a Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; he reveals a spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure.' Now it is good to see such arahants."

Then the brahmin householders of Venāgapura approached the Blessed One. Some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side; some exchanged greetings with him [181] and, when they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, sat down to one side; some reverentially saluted him and sat down to one side; some pronounced their name and clan and sat down to one side; some kept silent and sat down to one side. The brahmin Vacchagotta of Venāgapura then said to the Blessed One:

"It is astounding and amazing, Master Gotama, how Master Gotama's faculties are tranquil and the color of his skin is pure and bright. Just as a yellow jujube fruit in the autumn is pure and bright, so Master Gotama's faculties are tranquil and the color of his skin is pure and bright. Just as a palm fruit that has just been removed from its stalk is pure and bright, so Master Gotama's faculties are tranquil and the color of his skin is pure and bright. Just as an ornament of finest gold, well prepared by a skilled goldsmith and very skillfully wrought in the furnace, placed on red brocade, shines and beams and radiates, so Master Gotama's faculties are tranquil and the color of his skin is pure and bright.

"Whatever high and luxurious kinds of bedding there arethat is, a sofa, a divan, a long-haired coverlet, a coverlet of diverse colors, a white coverlet, a woolen coverlet with floral designs, a quilt of cotton wool, a woolen coverlet ornamented with animal figures, a woolen coverlet with double borders, awoolen coverlet with a single border, a silken sheet studded
with gems, a sheet made with silk threads and studded with gems, a dancer's rug, an elephant rug, a horse rug, a chariot rug, a rug of antelope hide, a spread made of the hide of the kadali-deer, [a bed] with a canopy above and red bolsters at both ends-Master Gotama surely gains them at will, without trouble or difficulty." ${ }^{\prime 442}$

"Brahmin, those high and luxurious kinds of bedding are rarely obtained by those who have gone forth, and if they are obtained, they are not allowed.

"But, brahmin, there are three kinds of high and luxurious beds that at present I gain at will, without trouble or difficulty. What three? [182] The celestial high and luxurious bed, the divine high and luxurious bed, and the noble high and luxurious bed. ${ }^{433}$ These are the three kinds of high and luxurious beds that at present I gain at will, without trouble or difficulty."

(1) "But, Master Gotama, what is the celestial high and luxurious bed that at present you gain at will, without trouble or difficulty?"

"Here, brahmin, when I am dwelling in dependence on a village or town, in the morning I dress, take my bowl and robe, and enter that village or town for alms. After the meal, when I have returned from the alms round, I enter a grove. I collect some grass or leaves that I find there into a pile and then sit down. Having folded my legs crosswise and straightened my body, I establish mindfulness in front of me. Then, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, I enter and dwell in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. With the subsiding of thought and examination, I enter and dwell in the second jhāna, which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration, without thought and examination. With the fading away as well of rapture, I dwell equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, I experience pleasure with the body; I enter and dwell in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: 'He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.' With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing-away of joy and dejection, I enter and dwell in the fourth jhāna, meither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity.
"Then, brahmin, when I am in such a state, if I walk back and forth, on that occasion my walking back and forth is celestial. ${ }^{\text {*4 }}$ If I am standing, on that occasion my standing is celestial. If I am sitting, on that occasion my sitting is celestial. If I lie down, on that occasion this is my celestial high and luxurious bed. This is that [183] celestial high and luxurious bed that at present I can gain at will, without trouble or difficulty."

"It is astounding and amazing, Master Gotama! Who else, apart from Master Gotama, can gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, such a celestial high and luxurious bed?

(2) "But, Master Gotama, what is the divine high and luxurious bed that at present you gain at will, without trouble or difficulty?"

"Here, brahmin, when I am dwelling in dependence on a village or town, in the morning I dress, take my bowl and robe, and enter that village or town for alms. After the meal, when I have returned from the alms round, I enter a grove. I collect some grass or leaves that I find there into a pile and then sit down. Having folded my legs crosswise and straightened my body, I establish mindfulness in front of me. Then I dwell pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, likewise the second quarter, the third quarter, and the fourth quarter. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to myself, I dwell pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will. I dwell pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with compassion... with a mind imbued with altruistic joy ... with a mind imbued with equanimity, likewise the second quarter, the third quarter, and the fourth quarter. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to myself, I dwell pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with equanimity, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will.

"Then, brahmin, when I am in such a state, if I walk back and forth, on that occasion my walking back and forth is divine. If I am standing, on that occasion my standing is divine. If I am sitting, on that occasion my sitting is divine. If I lie down, on that occasion this is my divine high and luxurious bed. This is that divine high and luxurious bed that at present I can gain at will, without trouble or difficulty." [184]
"It is astounding and amazing, Master Gotama! Who else, apart from Master Gotama, can gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, such a high and luxurious bed?

(3) "But, Master Gotama, what is the noble high and luxurious bed that at present you gain at will, without trouble or difficulty?"

"Here, brahmin, when I am dwelling in dependence on a village or town, in the morning I dress, take my bowl and robe, and enter that village or town for alms. After the meal, when I have returned from the alms round, I enter a grove. I collect some grass or leaves that I find there into a pile and then sit down. Having folded my legs crosswise and straightened my body, I establish mindfulness in front of me. Then I understand thus: 'I have abandoned greed, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising. I have abandoned hatred, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising. I have abandoned delusion, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising. ${ }^{\prime 445}$

"Then, brahmin, when I am in such a state, if I walk back and forth, on that occasion my walking back ahd forth is noble. If I am standing, on that occasion my standing is noble. If I am sitting, on that occasion my sitting is noble. If I lie down, on that occasion this is my noble high and luxurious bed. This is that noble high and luxurious bed that at present I can gain at will, without trouble or difficulty."

"It is astounding and amazing, Master Gotama! Who else, apart from Master Gotama, can gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, such a noble high and luxurious bed?

"Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the darkness so those with good eyesight can see forms. We now go for refuge to Master Gotama, [185] to the Dhamma; and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. Let Master Gotama consider us lay followers who from today have gone for refuge for life."

64 (4) Sarabha

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Now on that occasion a wanderer named Sarabha had recently left this Dhamma and discipline. ${ }^{446} \mathrm{He}$ had been telling an assembly in Rajagaha: "I have learned the Dhamma of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan son. After I learned their Dhamma, I left that Dhamma and discipline."

Then, one morning, a number of bhikkhus dressed, took their bowls and robes, and entered Rājagaha for alms. They then heard the wanderer Sarabha making such a statement to an assembly in Rājagaha. When those bhikkhus had walked for alms in Rajagaha, after their meal, when they returned from their alms round, they approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, the wanderer Sarabha, who recently left this Dhamma and discipline, has been telling an assembly in Rajagaha: 'I have learned the Dhamma of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan son. After I learned their Dhamma, I left that Dhamma and discipline.' It would be good, Bhante, if the Blessed One would go to the wanderers' park on the bank of the Sappinikā [river] and, out of compassion, approach the wanderer Sarabha." The Blessed One consented by silence.

Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and went to the wanderers' park on the bank of the Sappinikā [river]. He approached the wanderer Sarabha, sat down on the seat that was prepared [186] for him, and said to him: "Is it true, Sarabha, that you have been saying: 'I have learned the Dhamma of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan son. After I learned their Dhamma, I left that Dhamma and discipline'?" When this was said, the wanderer Sarabha was silent.

A second time the Blessed One said to the wanderer Sarabha: "Tell me, Sarabha, how have you learned the Dhamma of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan son? If you have not learned it completely, I will complete it. But if you have learned it completely, I will rejoice." But a second time the wanderer Sarabha was silent.

A third time the Blessed One said to the wanderer Sàrabha:447 "Tell me, Sarabha, how have you learned the Dhamma of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan son? If you have not learned
it completely, I will complete it. But if you have learned it completely, I will rejoice." But a third time the wanderer Sarabha was silent. ${ }^{48}$

Then those wanderers said to the wanderer Sarabha: "The ascetic Gotama has offered to give you whatever you might ask him for, friend Sarabha. Speak, friend Sarabha! How have you learned the Dhamma of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan son? If you have not learned it completely, the ascetic Gotama will complete it for you. But if you have learned it completely, he will rejoice." When this was said, the wanderer Sarabha sat silenced, disconcerted, hunched over, downcast, glum, and speechless.

Then the Blessed One, having understood that the wanderer Sarabha [sat] silenced, disconcerted, hunched over, downcast, glum, and speechless, said to those wanderers:

(1) "Wanderers, if anyone should say about me: 'Though you claim to be perfectly enlightened, you are not fully enlightened about these things,' [187] I might question him closely about this matter, interrogate him, and cross-examine him. ${ }^{49}$ When he is being closely questioned by me, interrogated, and crossexamined, it is impossible and inconceivable that he would not incur one or another of three consequences: he would either answer evasively and divert the discussion to an irrelevant subject; [or] display anger, hatred, and bitterness; or would sit silenced, disconcerted, hunched over, downcast, glum, and speechless, just like the wanderer Sarabha. ${ }^{450}$

(2) "If, wanderers, anyone should say about me: 'Though you claim to be one whose taints are destroyed, you have not fully destroyed these taints.' I might question him closely about this matter, interrogate him, and cross-examine him. When he is being closely questioned by me, interrogated, and crossexamined, it is impossible and inconceivable that he would not incur one or another of three consequences: he would either answer evasively and divert the discussion to an irrelevant subject; [or] display anger, hatred, and bitterness; or would sit silenced, disconcerted, hunched over, downcast, glum, and speechless, just like the wanderer Sarabha.

(3) "If, wanderers, anyone should say about me: 'The Dhamma does not lead one who practices it to the complete destruction of suffering, the goal for the sake of which you teach it, ${ }^{1451}$ I might question him closely about this matter, interrogate him,
and cross-examine him. When he is being closely questioned by me, interrogated, and cross-examined, it is impossible and inconceivable that he would not incur one or another of three consequences: he would either answer evasively and divert the discussion to an irrelevant subject, [or] display anger, hatred, and bitterness, or would sit silenced, disconcerted, hunched over, downcast, glum, and speechless, just like the wanderer Sarabha."

Then the Blessed One, having roared his lion's roar three times in the wanderers' park on the bank of the Sappinika [river], rose up into the air and departed. ${ }^{452}$

Then, soon after the Blessed One had left, those wanderers gave the wanderer Sarabha a thorough verbal lashing, ${ }^{453}$ [saying:] "Just as an old jackal in a huge forest might think: 'I will roar a lion's roar,' and yet would only howl and yelp like a jackal, so, friend Sarabha, claiming in the absence of the ascetic Gotama: 'I will roar a lion's roar,' [188] you only howled and yelped like a jackal. Just as, friend Sárabha, a chick might think: 'I will sing like a cock,' and yet would only sing like a chick, so, friend Sarabha, claiming in the absence of the ascetic Gotama: 'I will sing like a cock,' you only sang like a chick. ${ }^{454}$ Just as, friend Sarabha, a bull might think to bellow deeply in an empty cow shed, so, friend Sarabha, in the absence of the ascetic Gotama you thought you could bellow deeply." [In this way] those wanderers gave the wanderer Sarabha a thorough verbal lashing.

65 (5) Kesaputtiya ${ }^{455}$

On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Sangha of monks when he reached the town of the Kālāmas named Kesaputta. The Kālāmas of Kesaputta heard: "It is said that the ascetic Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan family, has arrived at Kesaputta. Now a good report about that Master Gotama has circulaied thus: 'That Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened... [as at 3:63]... [and] reveals a spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure.' Now it is good to see sucl arahants."

Then the Kālāmas of Kesaputta approached the Blessed One. Some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one
side... [as at 3:63]... some kept silent and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Kālāmas said to the Blessed One:

"Bhante, there are some ascetics and brahmins who come to Kesaputta. They explain and elucidate their own doctrines, but disparage, denigrate, deride, and denounce the doctrines of others. But then some other ascetics and brahmins come to Kesaputta, [189] and they too explain and elucidate their own doctrines, but disparage, denigrate, deride, and denounce the doctrines of others. We are perplexed and in doubt, Bhante, as to which of these good ascetics speak truth and which speak falsehood."

"It is fitting for you to be perplexed, Kālāmas, fitting for you to be in doubt. Doubt has arisen in you about a perplexing matter. ${ }^{456}$ Come, Kālāmas, do not go by oral tradition, by lineage of teaching, by hearsay, by a collection of scriptures, by logical reasoning, by inferential reasoning, by reasoned cogitation, by the acceptance of a view after pondering it, by the seeming competence [of a speaker], or because you think: 'The ascetic is our guru. ${ }^{1457}$ But when, Kālāmas, you know for yourselves: 'These things are unwholesome; these things are blameworthy; these things are censured by the wise; these things, if accepted and undertaken, lead to harm and suffering,' then you should abandon them.

(1) "What do you think, Kālāmas? When greed arises in a person, is it for his welfare or for his harm?"458

"For his harm, Bhante."

"Kālāmas, a greedy person, overcome by greed, with mind obsessed by it, destroys life, takes what is not given, transgresses with another's wife, and speaks falsehood; and he encourages others to do likewise. Will that lead to his harm and suffering for a long time?"

"Yes, Bhante."

(2) "What do you think, Kālāmas? When hatred arises in a person, is it for his welfare or for his harm?"

"For his harm, Bhante."

"Kālāmas, a person who is full of hate, overcome by hatred, with mind obsessed by it, destroys life... and he encourages others to do likewise. Will that lead to his harm and suffering for a long time?"

"Yes, Bhante."
(3) "What do you think, Kālāmas? When delusion arises in a person, is it for his welfare or for his harm?"

"For his harm, Bhante." [190]

"Kālāmas, a person who is deluded, overcome by delusion, with mind obsessed by it, destroys life... and he encourages others to do likewise. Will that lead to his harm and suffering for a long time?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"What do you think, Kālāmas? Are these things wholesome or unwholesome?" - "Unwholesome, Bhante." - "Blameworthy or blameless?" - "Blameworthy, Bhante." - "Censured or praised by the wise?" - "Censured by the wise, Bhante." - "Accepted and undertaken, do they lead to harm and suffering or not, or how do you take it?" - "Accepted and undertaken, these things lead to harm and suffering. So we take it."

"Thus, Kālāmas, when we said: 'Come, Kālāmas, do not go by oral tradition... But when you know for yourselves: "These things are unwholesome; these things are blameworthy; these things are censured by the wise; these things, if undertaken and practiced, lead to harm and suffering," then you should abandon them,' it is because of this that this was said.

"Come, Kālāmas, do not go by oral tradition, by lineage of teaching, by hearsay, by a collection of scriptures, by logical reasoning, by inferential reasoning, by reasoned cogitation, by the acceptance of a view after pondering it, by the seeming competence [of a speaker], or because you think: 'The ascetic is our guru.' But when you know for yourselves: 'These things are wholesome; these things are blameless; these things are praised by the wise; these things, if accepted and undertaken, lead to weltare and happiness,' then you should live in accordance with them.

(1) "What do you think, Kālāmas? When non-greed arises in a person, is it for his welfare or for his harm?"

"For his welfare, Bhante."

"Kālāmas, a person without greed, not overcome by greed, his mind not obsessed by it, does not destroy life, take what is not given, transgress with another's wife, or speak falsehood; nor does he encourage others to do likewise. [191] Will that lead to his welfare and happiness for a long time?"

"Yes, Bhante."
(2) "What do you think, Kālāmas? When non-hatred arises in a person, is it for his welfare or for his harm?"

"For his welfare, Bhante."

"Kālāmas, a person who is without hate, not overcome by hatred, his mind not obsessed by it, does not destroy life...nor does he encourage others to do likewise. Will that lead to his welfare and happiness for a long time?"

"Yes, Bhante."

(3) "What do you think, Kālāmas? When non-delusion arises in a person, is it for his welfare or for his harm?"

"For his welfare, Bhante."

"Kālāmas, a person who is undeluded, not overcome by delusion, his mind not obsessed by it, does not destroy life...nor does he encourage others to do likewise. Will that lead to his welfare and happiness for a long time?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"What do you think, Kālāmas? Are these things wholesome or unwholesome?" - "Wholesome, Bhante." - "Blameworthy or blameless?" - "Blameless, Bhante." - "Censured or praised by the wise?" - "Praised by the wise, Bhante." - "Accepted and undertaken, do they lead to welfare and happiness or not, or how do you take it?" - "Accepted and undertaken, these things lead to welfare and happiness. So we take it."

"Thus, Kālāmas, when we said: 'Come, Kālāmas, do not go by oral tradition... But when you know for yourselves: "These things are wholesome; these things are blameless; these things are praised by the wise; these things, if accepted and undertaken, lead to welfare and happiness," then you should [192] live in accordance with them,' it is because of this that this was said.

"Then, Kālāmas, that noble disciple, who is thus devoid of longing, devoid of ill will, unconfused, clearly comprehending, ever mindful, dwells pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with loving-kindness... with a mind imbued with compassion... with a mind imbued with altruistic joy... with a mind imbued with equanimity, likewise the second quarter, the third quarter, and the fourth quarter. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with equanimity, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will.
"This noble disciple, Kālāmas, whose mind is in this way without enmity, without ill will, undefiled, and pure, has won four assurances in this very life.

"The first assurance he has won is this: 'If there is another world, and if there is the fruit and result of good and bad deeds, it is possible that with the breakup of the body, after death, I will be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.'

"The second assurance he has won is this: 'If there is no other world, and there is no fruit and result of good and bad deeds, still right here, in this very life, I maintain myself in happiness, without enmity and ill will, free of trouble.

"The third assurance he has won is this: 'Suppose evil comes to one who does evil. Then, when I have no evil intentions toward anyone, how can suffering afflict me, since I do no evil deed? ${ }^{159}$

"The fourth assurance he has won is this: 'Suppose evil does not come to one who does evil. Then right here I see myself purified in both respects. ${ }^{1460}$

"This noble disciple, Kālāmas, whose mind is in this way without enmity, without ill will, undefiled, and pure, has won these four assurances in this very life." ${ }^{461}$

"So it is, Blessed One! So it is, Fortunate One! This noble disciple whose mind is in this way without enmity, without ill will, undefiled, and pure, [193] has won four assurances in this very life.

"The first assurance he has won ... [as above, down to:] ... The fourth assurance he has won is this: 'Suppose evil does not befall the evil-doer. Then right here I see myself purified in both respects.'

"This noble disciple, Bhante, whose mind is in this way without enmity, without ill will, undefiled, and pure, has won these four assurances in this very life.

"Excellent, Bhante! ... We go for refuge to the Blessed One, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. Let the Blessed One consider us lay followers who from today have gone for refuge for life."

66 (6) Sālha

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Venerable Nandaka was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Migāramātā's Mansion in the Eastern

Park. Then Sālha, Migāra's grandson, and Rohana, Pekhuniya's grandson, approached the Venerable Nandaka, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Venerable Nandaka then said to Sālha:

"Come, Sālha, do not go by oral tradition, by lineage of teaching, by hearsay, by a collection of scriptures, by logical reasoning, by inferential reasoning, by reasoned cogitation, by the acceptance of a view after pondering it, by the seeming competence [of a speaker], or because you think: 'The ascetic is our guru.' But when you [194] know for yourselves: 'These things are unwholesome; these things are blameworthy; these things are censured by the wise; these things, if accepted and undertaken, lead to harm and suffering,' then you should abandon them.

(1) "What do you think, Sālha, is there greed?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"I say this means longing. A greedy person, full of longing, destroys life, takes what is not given, transgresses with another's wife, and speaks falsehood; and he encourages others to do likewise. Will that lead to his harm and suffering for a long time?"

"Yes, Bhante."

(2) "What do you think, Sālha, is there hatred?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"I say this means ill will. A person full of hate, with a mind of ill will, destroys life . . . and he encourages others to do likewise. Will that lead to his harm and suffering for a long time?"

"Yes, Bhante."

(3) "What do you think, Sālha, is there delusion?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"I say this means ignorance. A deluded person, immersed in ignorance, destroys life... and he encourages others to do likewise. Will that lead to his harm and suffering for a long time?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"What do you think, Sālha? Are these things wholesome or unwholesome?" - "Unwholesome, Bhante." - "Blameworthy or blameless?" - "Blameworthy, Bhante." - "Censured or praised by the wise?" - "Censured by the wise, Bhante." - "Accepted and undertaken, do they lead to harm and suffering or not, or
how do you take it?" [195] - "Accepted and undertaken, these things lead to harm and suffering. So we take it."

"Thus, Sālha, when we said: 'Come, Sālha, do not go by oral tradition... But when you know for yourselves: "These things are unwholesome; these things are blameworthy; these things are censured by the wise; these things, if undertaken and practiced, lead to harm and suffering," then you should abandon them,' it is because of this that this was said.

"Come, Sālha, do not go by oral tradition, by lineage of teaching, by hearsay, by a collection of scriptures, by logical reasoning, by inferential reasoning, by reasoned cogitation, by the acceptance of a view after pondering it, by the seeming competence [of a speaker], or because you think: 'The ascetic is our guru.' But when you know for yourselves: 'These things are wholesome; these things are blameless; these things are praised by the wise; these things, if accepted and undertaken, lead to welfare and happiness,' then you should live in accordance with them.

(1) "What do you think, Sālha, is there non-greed?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"I say this means absence of longing. A person without greed, without longing, does not destroy life, take what is not given, transgress with another's wife, or speak falsehood; nor does he encourage others to do likewise. Will that lead to his welfare and happiness for a long time?"

"Yes, Bhante."

(2) "What do you think, Sālha, is there non-hatred?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"I say this means good will. A person without hate, with a mind of good will, does not destroy life ... nor does he encourage others to do likewise. Will that lead to his welfare and happiness for a long time?"

"Yes, Bhante."

(3) "What do you think, Sālha, is there non-delusion?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"I say this means true knowledge. An undeluded person, [196] who has arrived at true knowledge, does not destroy life ...nor does he encourage others to do likewise. Will that lead to his welfare and happiness for a long time?"

"Yes, Bhante."
"What do you think, Sālha? Are these things wholesome or unwholesome?" - "Wholesome, Bhante." - "Blameworthy or blameless?" - "Blameless, Bhante." - "Censured or praised by the wise?" - "Praised by the wise, Bhante." - "Accepted and undertaken, do they lead to welfare and happiness or not, or how do you take it?" - "Accepted and undertaken, these things lead to welfare and happiness. So we take it."

"Thus, Sālha, when we said: 'Come, Sālha, do not go by oral tradition... But when you know for yourselves: "These things are wholesome; these things are blameless; these things are praised by the wise; these things, if accepted and undertaken, lead to welfare and happiness," then you should live in accordance with them,' it is because of this that this was said.

"Then, Sālha, that noble disciple, who is thus devoid of longing, devoid of ill will, unconfused, clearly comprehending, ever mindful, dwells pervading one quarter with a mindimbued with loving-kindness... with a mind imbued with compassion... with a mind imbued with altruistic joy ... with a mind imbued with equanimity, likewise the second quarter, the third quarter, and the fourth quarter. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with equanimity, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will.

"He then understands thus: 'There is this; there is the inferior; there is the superior; there is a further escape from whatever is involved with perception. ${ }^{\prime 462}$ When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint of sensuality, from the taint of existence, and from the taint of ignorance. [197] When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: ' $[I t$ 's] liberated.' He understands: 'Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.'

"He understands thus: 'Formerly, there was greed; that was unwholesome. Now there is none; thus this is wholesome. Formerly, there was hatred; that was unwholesome. Now there is none; thus this is wholesome. Formerly, there was delusion; that was unwholesome. Now there is none; thus this is wholesome.'

"Thus in this very life he dwells hungerless, quenched and cooled, experiencing bliss, having himself become divine." ${ }^{\text {"463 }}$

67 (7) Bases of Talk

"Bhikkhus, there are these three bases of talk. What three? (1) Referring to the past, one would say: 'So it was in the past.' (2) Referring to the future, one would say: 'So it will be in the future.' (3) Referring to the present, one would say: 'So it is now, at present.'

"It is in relation to talk, bhikkhus, that a person may be understood as either fit to talk or unfit to talk. If this person is asked a question that should be answered categorically and he does not answer it categorically; [if he is asked] a question that should be answered after making a distinction and he answers it without making a distinction; [if he is asked] a question that should be answered with a counter-question and he answers it without asking a counter-question; [if he is asked] a question that should be set aside and he does not set it aside, in such a case this person is unfit to talk. ${ }^{464}$

"But if this person is asked a question that should be answered categorically and he answers it categorically; [if he is asked] a question that should be answered after making a distinction and he answers it after making a distinction; [if he is asked] a question that should be answered with a counter-question and he answers it with a counter-question; [if he is asked] a question that should be set aside and he sets it aside, in such a case this person is fit to talk.

"It is in relation to talk, bhikkhus, that a person should be understood as either fit to talk or unfit to talk. If this person is asked a question and he does not stand firm in regard to his position and the opposing position; if he does not stand firm in his stratagem; if he does not [198] stand firm in an assertion about what is known; if he does not stand firm in the procedure, in such a case this person is unfit to talk. ${ }^{465}$

"But if this person is asked a question and he stands firm in regard to his position and the opposing position; if he stands firm in his stratagem; if he stands firm in an assertion about what is known; if he stands firm in the procedure, in such a case this person is fit to talk.

"It is in relation to talk, bhikkhus, that a person should be understood as either fit to talk or unfit to talk. If this person is asked a question and he answers evasively, diverts the discussion to an irrelevant subject, and displays anger, hatred, and bitterness, in such a case this person is unfit to talk.
"But if this person is asked a question and he does not answer evasively, divert the discussion to an irrelevant subject, or display anger, hatred, and bitterness, in such a case this person is fit to talk.

"It is in relation to talk, bhikkhus, that a person should be understood as either fit to talk or unfit to talk. If this person is asked a question and he overwhelms [the questioner], crushes him, ridicules him, and seizes upon a slight error, ${ }^{468}$ in such a case this person is unfit to talk.

"But if this person is asked a question and he does not overwhelm [the questioner], or crush him, or ridicule him, or seize upon a slight error, in such a case this person is fit to talk.

"It is in relation to talk, bhikkhus, that a person should be understood as either having a supporting condition or not having a supporting condition. One who does not lend an ear does not have a supporting condition; one who lends an ear has a supporting condition. One who has a supporting condition directly knows one thing, fully understands one thing, abandons one thing, and realizes one thing. Directly knowing one thing, fully understanding one thing, abandoning one thing, and realizing one thing, he reaches right liberation. ${ }^{467}$

"This, bhikkhus, is the goal of talk, the goal of discussion, the goal of a supporting condition, the goal of lending an ear, that is, the emancipation of the mind through non-clinging." [199]

Those who speak with quarrelsome intent, settled in their opinions, swollen with pride, ignoble, having assailed virtues, ${ }^{468}$

look for openings [to attack] one another.

They mutually delight when their opponent speaks badly and makes a mistake, [they rejoice] in his bewilderment and defeat; but noble ones don't engage in such talk.

If a wise person wants to talk, having known the time is right, without quarrelsomeness or pride,
the sagely person should utter the speech that the noble ones practice, which is connected with the Dhamma and meaning. ${ }^{499}$

Not being insolent or aggressive, with a mind not elated, ${ }^{400}$

he speaks free from envy

on the basis of right knowledge.

He should approve of what is well expressed

but should not attack what is badly stated.

He should not train in faultfinding nor seize on the other's mistakes;

he should not overwhelm and crush his opponent, nor speak mendacious words.

Truly, a discussion among the good

is for the sake of knowledge and confidence.

Such is the way the noble discuss things;

this is the discussion of the noble ones.

Having understood this, the wise person

should not swell up but should discuss things.

68 (8) Other Sects

"Bhikkhus, wanderers of other sects may ask you: 'Friends, there are these three things. What three? Greed, hatred, and delusion. These are the three. What, friends, is the distinction, the disparity, the difference between them?' If you are asked this, how would you answer?"

"Bhante, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the Blessed One, take recourse in the Blessed One. It would be good if the Blessed One would clear up the meaning of this statement. Having heard it from him, the bhikkhus will retain it in mind."

"Then listen, bhikkhus, and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, if wanderers of other sects should ask you such a question, [200] you should answer them as follows: 'Lust,
friends, is slightly blameworthy but slow to fade away; hatred is very blameworthy but quick to fade away; delusion is very blameworthy and slow to fade away. ${ }^{1371}$

(1) "[Suppose they ask:] 'But, friends, what is the reason unarisen lust arises and arisen lust increases and expands?' You should answer: 'An attractive object. For one who attends carelessly to an attractive object, unarisen lust arises and arisen lust increases and expands. This, friends, is the reason unarisen lust arises and arisen lust increases and expands.'

(2) "[Suppose they ask:] 'But what, friends, is the reason unarisen hatred arises and arisen hatred increases and expands?' You should answer: 'A repulsive object. For one who attends carelessly to a repulsive object, unarisen hatred arises and arisen hatred increases and expands. This, friends, is the reason unarisen hatred arises and arisen hatred increases and expands.'

(3) "[Suppose they ask:] 'But what, friends, is the reason unarisen delusion arises and arisen delusion increases and expands?' You should answer: 'Careless attention. For one who attends carelessly, unarisen delusion arises and arisen delusion increases and expands. This, friends, is the reason unarisen delusion arises and arisen delusion increases and expands.'

(1) "[Suppose they ask:] 'But what, friends, is the reason unarisen lust does not arise and arisen lust is abandoned?' You should answer: 'An unattractive object. For one who attends carefully to an unattractive object, unarisen lust does not arise [201] and arisen lust is abandoned. This, friends, is the reason unarisen lust does not arise and arisen lust is abandoned.'

(2) "[Suppose they ask:] 'But what, friends, is the reason unarisen hatred does not arise and arisen hatred is abandoned?' You should answer: 'The liberation of the mind by lovingkindness. For one who attends carefully to the liberation of the mind by loving-kindness, unarisen hatred does not arise and arisen hatred is abandoned. This, friends, is the reason unarisen hatred does not arise and arisen hatred is abandoned.'

(3) "[Suppose they ask:] 'But what, friends, is the reason unarisen delusion does not arise and arisen delusion is abandoned?' You should answer: 'Careful attention. For one who attends carefully, unarisen delusion does not arise and arisen delusion is abandoned. This, friends, is the reason unarisen delusion does not arise and arisen delusion is abandoned.'"

69 (9) Roots

"Bhikkhus, there are these three unwholesome roots. What three? The unwholesome root, greed; the unwholesome root, hatred; and the unwholesome root, delusion.

(1) "Whatever greed occurs, bhikkhus, is unwholesome. Whatever [deed] a greedy person performs by body, speech, and mind is also unwholesome. When a greedy person, overcome by greed, with mind obsessed by it, inflicts suffering upon another under a false pretext ${ }^{472}$-by killing, imprisonment, confiscation, censure, or banishment-[thinking]: 'I am powerful, I want power,' that too is unwholesome. Thus numerous bad unwholesome qualities originate in him born of greed, caused by greed, arisen from greed, conditioned by greed.

(2) "Whatever hatred occurs is unwholesome. Whatever [deed] a person full of hate performs by body, speech, and mind is also unwholesome. When a person full of hate, overcome by hatred, with mind obsessed by it, inflicts suffering upon another under a false pretext... [thinking]: 'I am powerful, [202] I want power,' that too is unwholesome. Thus numerous bad unwholesome qualities originate in him born of hatred, caused by hatred, arisen from hatred, conditioned by hatred.

(3) "Whatever delusion occurs is unwholesome. Whatever [deed] a deluded person performs by body, speech, and mind is also unwholesome. When a deluded person, overcome by delusion, with mind obsessed by it, inflicts suffering upon another under a false pretext... [thinking]: 'I am powerful, I want power,' that too is unwholesome. Thus numerous bad unwholesome qualities originate in him born of delusion; caused by delusion, arisen from delusion, conditioned by delusion.

"Such a person, bhikkhus, is called one who speaks at an improper time, who speaks falsely, who speaks what is unbeneficial, who speaks non-Dhamma, who speaks nondiscipline. And why is such a person called one who speaks at an improper time... who speaks non-discipline? This person inflicts suffering upon another under a false pretext-by killing, imprisonment, confiscation, censure, or banishmentthinking: 'I am powerful, I want power.' Thus when spoken to, in accordance with fact, he despises [the one who reproaches him]; he does not admit [his faults]. When spoken to contrary to fact, he does not make an effort to unravel what is said to him:
'For such and such a reason this is untrue; for such and such a reason this is contrary to fact.' Therefore such a person is called one who speaks at an improper time, who speaks falsely, who speaks what is unbeneficial, who speaks non-Dhamma, who speaks non-discipline.

"Such a person, overcome by bad unwholesome qualities born of greed...born of hatred...born of delusion, with his mind obsessed by them, dwells in suffering in this very life, with distress, anguish, and fever, and with the breakup of the body, after death, a bad destination can be expected for him.

"Suppose a tree ${ }^{473}$ was choked and enveloped by three māluva creepers. It would meet with calamity, with disaster, with calamity and disaster. So too, such a person overcome by bad unwholesome qualities born of greed [203]...born of hatred...born of delusion, with his mind obsessed by them, dwells in suffering in this very life, with distress, anguish, and fever, and with the breakup of the body, after death, a bad destination can be expected for him. These are the three unwholesome roots.

"There are, bhikkhus, these three wholesome roots. What three? The wholesome root, non-greed; the wholesome root, non-hatred; and the wholesome root, non-delusion.

(1) "Whatever non-greed occurs, bhikkhus, is wholesome. Whatever [deed] one without greed performs by body, speech, and mind is also wholesome. When one without greed, not overcome by greed, with mind not obsessed by it, does not inflict suffering upon another under a false pretext-by killing, imprisonment, confiscation, censure, or banishment-thinking: 'I am powerful, I want power,' that too is wholesome. Thus numerous wholesome qualities originate in him born of nongreed, caused by non-greed, arisen from non-greed, conditioned by non-greed.

(2) "Whatever non-hatred occurs is wholesome. Whatever [deed] one without hate performs by body, speech, and mind is also wholesome. When one without hate, not overcome by hatred, with mind not obsessed by it, does not inflict suffering upon another under a false pretext... that too is wholesome. Thus numerous wholesome qualities originate in him born of non-hatred, caused by non-hatred, arisen from non-hatred, conditioned by non-hatred.
(3) "Whatever non-delusion occurs is wholesome. Whatever [deed] one who is undeluded performs by body, speech, and mind is also wholesome. When one who is undeluded, not overcome by delusion, with mind not obsessed by it, does not inflict suffering upon another under a false pretext...that too is wholesome. Thus [204] numerous wholesome qualities originate in him born of non-delusion, caused by non-delusion, arisen from non-delusion, conditioned by non-delusion.

"Such a person, bhikkhus, is called one who speaks at the proper time, who speaks in accordance with fact, who speaks what is beneficial, who speaks Dhamma, who speaks discipline. And why is such a person called one who speaks at the proper time... who speaks discipline? This person does not inflict suffering upon another under a false pretext-by killing, imprisonment, confiscation, censure, or banishmentthinking: 'I am powerful, I want power.' Thus when spoken to in accordance with fact, he admits [his faults]; he does not despise [the one who reproaches him]. When spoken to contrary to fact, he makes an effort to unravel what is said to him: 'For such and such a reason this is untrue; for such and such a reason this is contrary to fact.' Therefore such a person is called one who speaks at the proper time, who speaks in accordance with fact, who speaks what is beneficial, who speaks Dhamma, who speaks discipline.

"Such a person has abandoned the bad unwholesome qualities born of greed ...born of hatred ...born of delusion, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so that they are no more subject to future arising. He dwells happily in this very life, without distress, anguish, or fever, and in this very life he attains nibbāna.

"Suppose a tree was choked and enveloped by three māluvā creepers. Then a man would come along bringing a shovel and a basket. He would cut down the creepers at their roots, dig them up, and pull out the roots, even the fine rootlets and rootfiber. He would cut the creepers into pieces, split the pieces, and reduce them to slivers. Then he would dry the slivers in the wind and sun, burn them in a fire, [205] reduce them to ashes, and winnow the ashes in a strong wind or let them be carried away by the swift current of a river. In this way, those mäluvā creepers would be cut off at the root, made like a palm
stump, obliterated so that they are no more subject to future arising.

"So too, bhikkhus, such a person has abandoned the bad unwholesome qualities born of greed ... born of hatred...born of delusion, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so that they are no more subject to future arising. He dwells happily in this very life, without distress, anguish, or fever, and in this very life he attains nibbāna. These are the three wholesome roots."

# 70 (10) Uposatha

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Migāramātā's Mansion in the Eastern Park. Then Visākhā Migāramātā, on the day of the uposatha, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to her:

"Why, Visākhā, have you come in the middle of the day?"

"Today, Bhante, I am observing the uposatha."

"There are, Visākhā, three kinds of uposathas. What three? The cowherds' uposatha, the Niganthas' uposatha, ${ }^{474}$ and the noble ones' uposatha.

(1) "And how, Visākhā, is the cowherds' uposatha observed? Suppose, Visākhā, in the evening a cowherd returns the cows to their owners. He reflects thus: 'Today the cows grazed in such and such a place and drank water in such and such a place. Tomorrow the cows will graze in such and such a place and drink water in such and such a place.' So too, someone here observing the uposatha reflects thus: 'Today I ate this and that food; today I ate a meal of this and that kind. [206] Tomorrow I will eat this and thatfood; tomorrow I will eat a meal of this and that kind.' He thereby passes the day with greed and longing in his mind. It is in such a way that the cowherds' uposatha is observed. The cowherds' uposatha, thus observed, is not of great fruit and benefit, nor is it extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive.

(2) "And how, Visākhā, is the Niganthas' uposatha observed? There are, Visākhā, ascetics called Niganthas. They enjoin their disciples thus: 'Come, good man, lay down the rod toward living beings dwelling more than a hundred yojanas' distance in the eastern quarter. ${ }^{475}$ Lay down the rod toward living beings
dwelling more than a hundred yojanas' distance in the western quarter. Lay down the rod toward living beings dwelling more than a hundred yojanas' distance in the northern quarter. Lay down the rod toward living beings dwelling more than a hundred yojanas' distance in the southern quarter.' Thus they enjoin them to be sympathetic and compassionate toward some living beings, but not to others. On the uposatha day, they enjoin their disciples thus: 'Come, good man, having laid aside all clothes, recite: 'I am not anywhere the belonging of anyone, nor is there anywhere anything in any place that is mine. ${ }^{476}$ However, his parents know: 'This is our son.' And he knows: 'These are my parents.' His wife and children know: 'He is our supporter.' And he knows: 'These are my wife and children.' His slaves, workers, and servants know: 'He is our master.' And he knows: 'These are my slaves, workers, and servants.' Thus on an occasion when they should be enjoined in truthfulness, [the Niganthas] enjoin them in false speech. This, I say, is false speech. When that night has passed, he makes use of possessions that have not been given. This, I say, is taking what has not been given. It is in such a way that the Niganthas' uposatha is observed. When one has observed the uposatha in the way of the Niganthas, the uposatha is not of great fruit and benefit, nor is it extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive.

(3) "And how, Visākhā, is the noble ones' uposatha observed? [207] The defiled mind is cleansed by exertion. ${ }^{477}$ And how is the defiled mind cleansed by exertion? Here, Visākhā, a noble disciple recollects the Tathāgata thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' When a noble disciple recollects the Tathāgata, his mind becomes placid, joy arises, and the defilements of the mind are abandoned in the same way that one's head, when dirty, is cleansed by exertion.

"And how, Visākhā, does one cleanse a dirty head by exertion? By means of cleansing paste, clay, water, and the appropriate effort by the person. It is in such a way that one's head, when dirty, is cleansed by exertion. So too, the defiled mind is cleansed by exertion. And how is the defiled mind cleansed by exertion? Here, Visākhā, a noble disciple recollects
the Tathāgata thus: 'The Blessed One is ...teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' When a noble disciple recollects the Tathāgata, his mind becomes placid, joy arises, and the defilements of the mind are abandoned. This is called a noble disciple who observes the uposatha of Brahmā, who dwells together with Brahmā, and it is by considering Brahmā that his mind becomes placid, joy arises, and the defilements of the mind are abandoned. ${ }^{478}$ It is in this way that the defiled mind is cleansed by exertion.

"The defiled mind, Visākhā, is cleansed by exertion. And how is the defiled mind cleansed by exertion? Here, Visākhā, a noble disciple recollects the Dhamma thus: 'The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.' When a noble disciple recollects the Dhamma, his mind becomes placid, joy arises, and the defilements of the mind [208] are abandoned in the same way that one's body, when dirty, is cleansed by exertion.

"And how, Visākhā, does one cleanse a dirty body by exertion? By means of a bathing brush, lime powder, water, and the appropriate effort by the person. It is in such a way that one's body, when dirty, is cleansed by exertion. So too, the defiled mind is cleansed by exertion. And how is the defiled mind cleansed by exertion? Here, Visākhā, a noble disciple recollects the Dhamma thus: 'The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One...to be personally experienced by the wise.' When a noble disciple recollects the Dhamma, his mind becomes placid, joy arises, and the defilements of the mind are abandoned. This is called a noble disciple who observes the uposatha of the Dhamma, who dwells together with the Dhamma, and it is by considering the Dhamma that his mind becomes placid, joy arises, and the defilements of the mind are abandoned. It is in this way that the defiled mind is cleansed by exertion.

"The defiled mind, Visākhā, is cleansed by exertion. And how is the defiled mind cleansed by exertion? Here, Visākhā, a noble disciple recollects the Sangha thus: 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is practicing the good way, practicing the straight way, practicing the true way, practicing the proper way; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals-this

Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.' When a noble disciple recollects the Sangha, his mind becomes placid, joy arises, and the defilements of the mind are abandoned in the same way that a dirty cloth is cleansed by exertion.

"And how, Visākhā, does one cleanse a dirty cloth by exertion? [209] By means of heat, lye, cow dung, water, and the appropriate effort by the person. It is in such a way that a dirty cloth is cleansed by exertion. So too, the defiled mind is cleansed by exertion. And how is the defiled mind cleansed by exertion? Here, Visākhā, a noble disciple recollects the Sangha thus: 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is practicing the good way...the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.' When a noble disciple recollects the Sangha, his mind becomes placid, joy arises, and the defilements of the mind are abandoned. This is called a noble disciple who observes the uposatha of the Sangha, who dwells together with the Sangha, and it is by considering the Sangha that his mind becomes placid, joy arises, and the defilements of the mind are abandoned. It is in this way that the defiled mind is cleansed by exertion.

"The defiled mind, Visākhā, is cleansed by exertion. And how is the defiled mind cleansed by exertion? Here, Visākhā, a noble disciple recollects his own virtuous behavior as unbroken, flawless, unblemished, unblotched, freeing, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading to concentration. When a noble disciple recollects his virtuous behavior, his mind becomes placid, joy arises, and the defilements of the mind are abandoned in the same way that a dirty mirror is cleansed by exertion.

"And how, Visākhā, is a dirty mirror cleansed by exertion? By means of oil, ashes, a roll of cloth, and the appropriate effort by the person. It is in such a way that a dirty mirror is cleansed by exertion. So too, the defiled mind is cleansed by exertion. And how is the defiled mind cleansed by exertion? [210] Here, Visākhā, a noble disciple recollects his own virtuous behavior as unbroken ...leading to concentration. When a noble disciple recollects his virtuous behavior, his mind becomes placid, joy arises, and the defilements of the mind are abandoned. This is called a noble disciple who observes the uposatha of virtuous behavior, who dwells together with virtuous behavior, and it is
by considering virtuous behavior that his mind becomes placid, joy arises, and the defilements of the mind are abandoned. It is in this way that the defiled mind is cleansed by exertion.

"The defiled mind, Visākhā, is cleansed by exertion. And how is the defiled mind cleansed by exertion? Here, Visākhā, a noble disciple recollects the deities thus: 'There are devas [ruled by] the four great kings, Tāvatimsa devas, Yāma devas, Tusita devas, devas who delight in creation, devas who control what is created by others, devas of Brahmā's company, and devas still higher than these. ${ }^{479}$ I too have such faith as those deities possessed because of which, when they passed away here, they were reborn there; I too have such virtuous behavior...such learning ...such generosity ...such wisdom as those deities possessed because of which, when they passed away here, they were reborn there.' When a noble disciple recollects the faith, virtuous behavior, learning, generusity, and wisdom in himself and in those deities, his mind becomes placid, joy arises, and the defilements of the mind are abandoned in the same way that impure gold is cleansed by exertion.

"And how, Visākhā, is impure gold cleansed by exertion? By means of a furnace, salt, red chalk, a blow-pipe and tongs, and the appropriate effort by the person. It is in such a way that impure gold is cleansed by exertion. So too, the defiled mind is cleansed by exertion. [211] And how is the defiled mind cleansed by exertion? Here, Visākhā, a noble disciple recollects the deities thus: 'There are devas [ruled by] the four great kings... and devas still higher than these. I too have such faith...such wisdom as those deities possessed because of which, when they passed away here, they were reborn there.' When a noble disciple recollects the faith, virtuous behavior, learning, generosity, and wisdom in himself and in those deities, his mind becomes placid, joy arises, and the defilements of the mind are abandoned. This is called a noble disciple who observes the uposatha of the deities, who dwells together with the deities, and it is by considering the deities that his mind becomes placid, joy arises, and the defilements of the mind are abandoned. It is in this way that the defiled mind is cleansed by exertion.

(i) "This noble disciple, Visākhā, reflects thus: ${ }^{480}$ 'As long as they live the arahānts abandon and abstain from the destruc-
tion of life; with the rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious and kindly, they dwell compassionate toward all living beings. Today, for this night and day, I too shall abandon and abstain from the destruction of life; with the rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious and kindly, I too shall dwell compassionate toward all living beings. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.

(ii) "As long as they live the arahants abandon and abstain from taking what is not given; they take only what is given, expect only what is given, and are honest at heart, devoid of theft. Today, for this night and day, I too shall abandon and abstain from taking what is not given; I shall accept only what is given, expect only what is given, and be honest at heart, devoid of theft. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.

(iii) "'As long as they live the arahants abandon sexual activity and observe celibacy, living apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the common person's practice. Today, for this night and day, I too shall abandon sexual activity and observe celibacy, living apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the common person's practice. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me. [212]

(iv) "'As long as they live the arahants abandon and abstain from false speech; they speak truth, adhere to truth; they are trustworthy and reliable, no deceivers of the world. Today, for this night and day, I too shall abandon and abstain from false speech; I shall be a speaker of truth, an adherent of truth, trustworthy and reliable, no deceiver of the world. I shall imitate. the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.

(v) "'As long as they live the arahants abandon and abstain from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Today, for this night and day, I too shall abandon and abstain from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.

(vi) "'As long as they live the arahants eat once a day, ${ }^{481}$ abstaining from eating at night and from food outside the proper time. Today, for this night and day, I too shall eat once a day, abstaining from eating at night and from food outside
the proper time. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.

(vii) "'As long as they live the arahants abstain from dancing, singing, instrumental music, and unsuitable shows, and from adorning and beautifying themselves by wearing garlands and applying scents and unguents. Today, for this night and day, I too shall abstain from dancing, singing, instrumental music, and unsuitable shows, and from adorning and beautifying myself by wearing garlands and applying scents and unguents. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.

(viii) "'As long as they live the arahants abandon and abstain from the use of high and luxurious beds; they lie down on a low resting place, either a small bed or a straw mat. Today; for this night and day, I too shall abandon and abstain from the use of high and luxurious beds; I shall lie down on a low resting place, either a small bed or a straw mat. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.'

"It is in this way, Visākhā, that the noble ones' uposatha is observed. When one has observed the uposatha in the way of the nuble ones it is of great fruit and benefit, extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive.

"To what extent is it of great fruit and benefit? To what extent is it extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive? Suppose, Visākhā, one were to exercise sovereignty and kingship over these sixteen great countries abounding in the seven precious substances, ${ }^{482}$ [213] that is, [the countries of] the Angans, the Magadhans, the Kāsis, the Kosalans, the Vajjis, the Mallas, the Cetis, the Vangas, the Kurus, the Pañcālas, the Macchas, the Sūrasenas, the Assakas, the Avantis, the Gandhārans, and the Kambojans: ${ }^{483}$ this would not be worth a sixteenth part of the uposatha observance complete in those eight factors. For what reason? Because human kingship is poor compared to celestial happiness.

"For the devas [ruled by] the four great kings, ${ }^{484}$ a single night and day is equivalent to fifty human years; thirty such days make up a month, and twelve such months make up a year. The life span of the devas [ruled by] the four great kings is five hundred such celestial years. It is possible, Visakhā, that a woman or man here who observes the uposatha complete in these eight factors will, with the breakup of the body, after
death, be reborn in companionship with the devas [ruled by] the four great kings. It was with reference to this that I said human kingship is poor compared to celestial happiness.

"For the Tāvatimsa devas a single night and day is equivalent to a hundred human years; thirty such days make up a month, and twelve such months make up a year. The life span of the Tāvatimsa devas is a thousand such celestial years. It is possible, Visākhā, that a woman or man here who observes the uposatha complete in these eight factors will, with the breakup of the body, after death, be reborn in companionship with the Tāvatimsa devas. It was with reference to this that I said human kingship is poor compared to celestial happiness.

"For the Yāma devas a single night and day is equivalent to two hundred human years; thirty such days make up a month, and twelve such months make up a year. The life span of the Yāma devas is two thousand such celestial years. It is possible, Visākhā, that a woman or man here who observes the uposatha complete in these eight factors will, with the breakup of the body, after death, be reborn in companionship with the Yāma devas. It was with reference to this [214] that I said human kingship is poor compared to celestial happiness.

"For the Tusita devas, a single night and day is equivalent to four hundred human years; thirty such days make up a month, and twelve such months make up a year. The life span of the Tusita devas is four thousand such celestial years. It is possible, Visākhā, that a woman or man here who observes the uposatha complete in these eight factors will, with the breakup of the body, after death, be reborn in companionship with the Tusita devas. It was with reference to this that I said human kingship is poor compared to celestial happiness.

"For the devas who delight in creation, a single night and day is equivalent to eight hundred human years; thirty such days make up a month, and twelve such months make up a year. The life span of the devas who delight in creation is eight thousand such celestial years. It is possible, Visākhā, that a woman or man here who observes the uposatha complete in these eight factors will, with the breakup of the body, after death, be reborn in companionship with the devas who delight in creation. It was with reference to this that I said human kingship is poor compared to celestial happiness.

"For the devas who control what is created by others, a single
night and day is equivalent to sixteen hundred human years; thirty such days make up a month, and twelve such months make up a year. The life span of the devas who control what is created by others is sixteen thousand such celestial years. It is possible, Visākhā, that a woman or man here who observes the uposatha complete in these eight factors will, with the breakup of the body, after death, be reborn in companionship with the devas who control what is created by others. It was with reference to this that I said human kingship is poor compared to celestial happiness."

One should not kill living beings or take what is not given;

one should not speak falsehood or drink intoxicants;

[215]

one should refrain from sexual activity, from unchastity; one should not eat at night or at an improper time.

One should not wear garlands or apply scents; one should sleep on a [low] bed or a mat on the ground; this, they say, is the eight-factored uposatha proclaimed by the Buddha, who reached the end of suffering.

As far as the sun and moon revolve, shedding light, so beautiful to gaze upon, dispellers of darkness, moving through the firmament, they shine in the sky, ${ }^{485}$ brightening up the quarters.

Whatever wealth exists in this spherepearls, gems, and excellent beryl, ${ }^{486}$

horn gold and mountain gold, and the natural gold called hataka-487

those are not worth a sixteenth part of an uposatha complete in the eight factors, just as all the hosts of stars

[do not match] the moon's radiance. ${ }^{488}$

Thereforea virtuous woman or man, having observed the uposatha complete in eight factors,
and having made merit productive of happiness, goes blameless to a heavenly state.

# III. ÄNANDA

## 71 (1) Channa

Then the wanderer Channa approached the Venerable Ānanda and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Ānanda:

"Friend Ānanda, do you prescribe the abandoning of lust, hatred, and delusion?"469

"We do, friend." [216]

"But what is the danger that you have seen on account of which you prescribe the abandoning of lust, hatred, and delusion?"

(1) "One excited by lust, friend, overcome by lust, with mind obsessed by it, intends for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, and for the affliction of both, and he experiences mental suffering and dejection. But when lust is abandoned, he does not intend for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, or for the affliction of both, and he does not experience mental suffering and dejection.

"One excited by lust, overcome by lust, with mind obsessed by it, engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when lust is abandoned, one does not engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. One excited by lust, overcome by lust, with mind obsessed by it, does not understand as it really is his own good, the good of others, and the good of both. But when lust is abandoned, one understands as it really is one's own good, the good of others, and the good of both. Lust leads to blindness, loss of vision, and lack of knowledge; it is obstructive to wisdom, aligned with distress, and does not lead to nibbāna.

(2) "One full of hate, overcome by hatred...

(3) "One deluded, overcome by delusion, with mind obsessed by it, intends for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, and for the affliction of both, and he experiences mental suffering and dejection. But when delusion is abandoned, he does not intend for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, or for the affliction of both, and he does not experience mental suffering and dejection.
"One deluded, overcome by delusion, with mind obsessed by it, engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when delusion is abandoned, he does not engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. One deluded, overcome by delusion, with mind obsessed by it, does not understand as it really is his own good, the good of others, and the good of both. But when delusion [217] is abandoned, one understands as it really is one's own good, the good of others, and the good of both. Delusion leads to blindness, loss of vision, and lack of knowledge; it is obstructive to wisdom, aligned with distress, and does not lead to nibbāna.

"Having seen these dangers in lust, hatred, and delusion, we prescribe their abandoning."

"But is there a path, friend, is there a way to the abandoning of lust, hatred, and delusion?"

"There is a path, friend, there is a way to the abandoning of lust, hatred, and delusion."

"But what is the path, what is the way to the abandoning of lust, hatred, and delusion?"

"It is just this noble eightfold path, that is, right view...right concentration. This is the path, the way to the abandoning of lust, hatred, and delusion."

"Excellent, friend, is the path, excellent the way to the abandoning of lust, hatred, and delusion. It is enough, friend Ānanda, to be heedful."

# 72 (2) Ājīvaka

On one occasion the Venerable Ānanda was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita's Park. Then a certain householder, a disciple of the Ājīvakas, ${ }^{490}$ approached the Venerable Ānanda, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

(1) "Bhante Ānanda, whose Dhamma is well expounded? (2) Who in the world are practicing the good way? (3) Who in the world are the fortunate ones?"491

"Well then, householder, I will question you about this matter. You should answer as you see fit.

(1) "What do you think, householder? Is the Dhamma of those who teach the abandoning of lust, hatred, and delusion well expounded or not, or how do you take it?" [218]

"The Dhamma of those who teach the abandoning of lust, hatred, and delusion is well expounded. So I take it."
(2) "What do you think, householder? Are those practicing for the abandoning of lust, hatred, and delusion practicing the good way in the world or not, or how do you take it?"

"Those practicing for the abandoning of lust, hatred, and delusion are practicing the good way in the world. So I take it."

(3) "What do you think, householder? Are those who have abandoned lust, hatred, and delusion, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so that they are no more subject to future arising fortunate ones in the world or not, or how do you take it?"

"Those who have abandoned lust, hatred, and delusion, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so that they are no more subject to future arising are fortunate ones in the world. So I take it."

"Thus, householder, you have declared: 'The Dhamma of those who teach the abandoning of lust, hatred, and delusion is well expounded.' You have declared: 'Those practicing for the abandoning of lust, hatred, and delusion are practicing the good way in the world.' And you have declared: 'Those who have abandoned lust, hatred, and delusion, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so that they are no more subject to future arising are fortunate ones in the world."

"It is astounding and amazing, Bhante, that there is no extolling of one's own Dhamma nor any denigration of the Dhamma of others, but just the teaching of the Dhamma in its own sphere. The meaning is stated, but one does not bring oneself into the picture. ${ }^{492}$

"Bhante Ānanda, you teach the Dhamma for the abandoning of lust, hatred, and delusion, [219] so your Dhamma is well expounded. You are practicing for the abandoning of lust, hatred, and delusion, so you are practicing the good way in the world. You have abandoned lust, hatred, and delusion, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so that they are no more subject to future arising, so you are the fortunate ones in the world.

"Excellent, Bhante! Excellent, Bhante! The noble Ānanda has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the darkness so those with good eyesight can see
forms. Bhante Ananda, I now go for refuge to the Blessed One, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. Let the Noble Ananda consider ine a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

# 73 (3) The Sakyan

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Park. Now on that occasion the Blessed One had just recently recovered from illness. Then the Sakyan Mahānāma approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"For a long time, Bhante, I have understood the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One thus: 'Knowledge occurs for one who is concentrated, not for one who lacks concentration.' Does concentration precede knowledge, Bhante, or does knowledge precede concentration?"

Then it occurred to the Venerable Ananda: "The Blessed One has just recently recovered from his illness, yet this Mahānāma the Sakyan asks him a very deep question. Let me lead Mahānāma the Sakyan off to one side and teach him the Dhamma."

Then the Venerable Ānanda took Mahānāma the Sakyan by the arm, led him off to one side, and said to him: "The Blessed One has spoken about the virtuous behavior of a trainee and the virtuous behavior of one beyond training, the concentration of a trainee [220] and the concentration of one beyond training, the wisdom of a trainee and the wisdom of one beyond training.

(1) "And what, Mahānāma, is the virtuous behavior of a trainee? Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. This is called the virtuous behavior of a trainee.

(2) "And what is the concentration of a trainee? ${ }^{493}$ Here, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna... [as at 3:58]... the fourth jhāna.... This is called the concentration of a trainee.

(3) "And what is the wisdom of a trainee? Here, a bhikkhu understands as it really is: 'This is suffering'... [as in 3:12]...'This
is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' This is called the wisdom of a trainee.

"When this noble disciple is thus accomplished in virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom, with the destruction of the taints, he realizes for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. ${ }^{494}$

"It is in this way, Mahānāma, that the Blessed One has spoken about the virtuous behavior of a trainee and the virtuous behavior of one beyond training; about the concentration of a trainee and the concentration of one beyond training; about the wisdom of a trainee and the wisdom of one beyond training."

# 74 (4) The Nigantha

On one occasion the Venerable Ānanda was dwelling at Vesāli in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then the Licchavi Abhaya and the Licchavi Paṇditakumāra approached the Venerable Ānanda, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. ${ }^{495}$ The Licchavi Abhaya then said to the Venerable Ānanda:

"Bhante, the Nigantha Nātaputta claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing and to have all-embracing knowledge and vision, [saying]: 'When I am walking, standing, sleeping, and awake, knowledge and vision are constantly and continuously present to me. ${ }^{1496}$ He prescribes the termination of old kammas by means of austerity and the demolition of the bridge by not creating any new kamma. ${ }^{497}$ [221] Thus, through the destruction of kamma, suffering is destroyed. Through the destruction of suffering, feeling is destroyed. Through the destruction of feeling, all suffering will be worn away. In this way, the overcoming [of suffering] takes place through this directly visible purification by wearing away. ${ }^{498}$ What does the Blessed One say about this?"

"Abhaya, these three kinds of wearing-away purification have been properly expounded by the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One who knows and sees, for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and dejection, for the achievement of the method, for the realization of nibbāna: What three?

(1) "Here, Abhaya, a bhikkhu is virtuous...[as in 3:73]... Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. He does not
create any new kamma and he terminates the old kamma having contacted it again and again. ${ }^{499}$ The wearing away is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.

(2) "When, Abhaya, this bhikkhu is thus accomplished in virtuous behavior, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna... [as in 3:58] ... the fourth jhāna.... He does not create any new kamma and he terminates the old kamma having contacted it again and again. The wearing away is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.

(3) "When, Abhaya, this bhikkhu is thus accomplished in virtuous behavior and concentration, then, with the destruction of the taints, he realizes for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. He does not create any new kamma and he terminates the old kamma having contacted it again and again. The wearing away is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise. ${ }^{500}$

"These, Abhaya, are the three kinds of wearing-away purification that have been properly expounded by the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One who knows and sees, for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and dejection, for the achievement of the method, for the realization of nibbāna."

When this was said, the Licchavi Panditakumāra said to the Licchavi Abhaya: "Why, friend Abhaya, don't you thank ${ }^{501}$ the Venerable Ānanda for his well-stated words?"

"How, friend, could I not thank the Venerable Ānanda for his well-stated words? [222] If one were not to thank the Venerable Ānanda for his well-stated words, one's head would split apart!"

# 75 (5) Should Be Encouraged

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Ānanda, those for whom you have compassion and who
think you should be heeded, whether friends or companions, relatives or family members, should be encouraged, settled, and established by you in three things. What three?

(1) "They should be encouraged, settled, and established in unwavering confidence ${ }^{502}$ in the Buddha thus: 'The Blessed One is ... [as in 3:70]...teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.'

(2) "They should be encouraged, settled, and established in unwavering confidence in the Dhamma thus: 'The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One, directly visible ... [as in 3:70]...to be personally experienced by the wise.'

(3) "They should be encouraged, settled, and established in unwavering confidence in the Sangha thus: 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is practicing the good way... [as in 3:70]... the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.'

"There might be, Ananda; alteration in the four great ele-ments-the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element-but there cannot be alteration in a noble disciple who possesses unwavering confidence in the Buddha. In this context, this is alteration: that this noble disciple who possesses unwavering confidence in the Buddha could be reborn in hell, in the animal realm, or in the sphere of afflicted spirits. Such a thing is impossible. [223]

"There might be, Ananda, alteration in the four great elements-the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element-but there cannot be alteration in a noble disciple who possesses unwavering confidence in the Dhamma ... in the Sangha. In this context, this is alteration: that this noble disciple who possesses unwavering confidence in the Sangha could be reborn in hell, in the animal realm, or in the sphere of afflicted spirits. Such a thing is impossible.

"Ānanda, those for whom you have compassion and who think you should be heeded, whether friends or companions, relatives or family members, should be encouraged, settled, and established by you in these three things."

# 76 (6) Existence

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, it is said: 'existence, existence.' In what way, Bhante, is there existence?"503
(1) "If, Ānanda, there were no kamma ripening in the sensory realm, would sense-sphere existence be discerned?"

"No, Bhante."

"Thus, Ānanda, for beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, kamma is the field, consciousness the seed, and craving the moisture for their consciousness to be established in an inferior realm. In this way there is the production of renewed existence in the future. ${ }^{594}$

(2) "If, Ānanda, there were no kamma ripening in the form realm, would form-sphere existence be discerned?"

"No, Bhante."

"Thus, Ānanda, for beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, kamma is the field, consciousness the seed, and craving the moisture for their consciousness to be established in a middling realm. In this way there is the production of renewed existence in the future.

(3) "If, Ānanda, there were no kamma ripening in the formless realm, would formless-sphere existence be discerned?" [224]

"No, Bhante."

"Thus, Ānanda, for beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, kamma is the field, consciousness the seed, and craving the moisture for their consciousness to be established in a superior realm. In this way there is the production of renewed existence in the future.

"It is in this way, Ānanda, that there is existence."

# 77 (7) Volition and Aspiration

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One ... and said to him:

"Bhante, it is said: 'existence, existence.' In what way, Bhante, is there existence?"

(1) "If, Ānanda, there were no kamma ripening in the sensory realm, would sense-sphere existence be discerned?"

"No, Bhante."

"Thus, Ānanda, for beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, kamma is the field, consciousness the seed, and craving the moisture for their volition and aspiration ${ }^{595}$ to be established in an inferior realm. In this way there is the production of renewedexistence in the future.

(2) "If, Ānanda, there were no kamma ripening in the form realm, would form-sphere existence be discerned?".
"No, Bhante."

"Thus, Ānanda, for beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, kamma is the field, consciousness the seed, and craving the moisture for their volition and aspiration to be established in a middling realm. In this way there is the production of renewed existence in the future.

(3) "If, Ānanda, there were no kamma ripening in the formless realm, would formless-sphere existence be discerned?"

"No, Bhante."

"Thus, Ānanda, for beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, kamma is the field, consciousness the seed, and craving the moisture for their volition and aspiration to be established in a superior realm. In this way there is the production of renewed existence in the future.

"It is in this way, Ānanda, that there is existence." [225]

78 (8) Setting Up

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One. . . . The Blessed One then said to him:

"Ānanda, are all behavior and observances, [austere] lifestyles, and spiritual life fruitful when set up as the essence?"506

"Not exclusively so, Bhante."

"Well then, Ānanda, distinguish [them]."

"Bhante, suppose one cultivates behavior and observances, an [austere] lifestyle, and a spiritual life, setting them up as if they were the essence. If unwholesome qualities then increase and wholesome qualities decline, such behavior and observances, [austere] lifestyle, and spiritual life, set up as the essence, are fruitless. But if unwholesome qualities decline and wholesome qualities increase, then such behavior and observances, [austere] lifestyle, and spiritual life, set up as the essence, are fruitful."

This is what the Venerable Ānanda said. The Teacher agreed. Then the Venerable Ānanda, thinking, "The Teacher has agreed," paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and left.

Then, not long after the Venerable Ānanda had left, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, Ānanda is a trainee, but it is not easy to find one equal to him in wisdom."

79 (9) Fragrance

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One . . . and said to him:

"Bhante, there are these three fragrances that spread with the wind but not against the wind. What three? The fragrance of roots, the fragrance of heartwood, and the fragrance of flowers. These three fragrances spread with the wind but not against the wind. Is there any fragrance that spreads with the wind, against the wind, and both with and against the wind?"

"There is, Ānanda, a fragrance that spreads with the wind, [226] against the wind, and both with and against the wind."

"But, Bhante, what is that fragrance?"

"Here, Ānanda, in whatever village or town a man or a woman has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha; he or she is virtuous and of good character, abstaining from the destruction of life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech, and liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness; and he or she dwells at home with a heart devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in relinquishment, devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing-in such a case, ascetics and brahmins in [all] quarters speak praise, saying: 'In such and such a village or town a man or a woman has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha ... delighting in giving and sharing.'

"The deities and the spirits, ${ }^{507}$ too, speak praise, saying: 'In such and such a village or town a man or a woman has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha... is virtuous and of good character... delighting in giving and sharing.'

"This, Ānanda, is the fragrance that spreads with the wind, against the wind, and both with and against the wind."

The fragrance of flowers does not spread against the wind,

nor the fragrance of sandal, tagara, ${ }^{508}$ or jasmine.

But the fragrance of good people spreads against the wind:

the good person's fragrance pervades all quarters. ${ }^{509}$

80 (10) Abhibhū

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One ...[227]... and said to him:

"Bhante, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard this; in his presence I learned this: 'Abhibhū, a disciple of the Blessed One Sikhi, while staying in the brahmā world, conveyed his voice throughout a thousandfold world system. ${ }^{510}$ How far, Bhante, can the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One convey his voice?"

"He was a disciple, Ānanda. The Tathāgatas are immeasurable. ${ }^{\prime 511}$

A second time the Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard this.... How far, Bhante, can the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One convey his voice?"

"He was a disciple, Ānanda. The Tathāgatas are immeasurable."

A third time the Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard this.... How far, Bhante, can the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One convey his voice?"

"Have you heard, Ānanda, about a thousandfold minor world system?"

"It is the time for this, Blessed One. It is the time for this, Fortunate One. The Blessed One should speak. Having heard this from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will retain it in mind."

"Well then, Ānanda, listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," the Venerable Ānanda replied. The Blessed One said this:

(1) "A thousand times the world in which the sun and moon revolve and light up the quarters with their brightness is called a thousandfold minor world system. ${ }^{512}$ In that thousandfold world system there are a thousand moons, a thousand suns, a thousand Sinerus king of mountains, a thousand Jambudīpas, a thousand Aparagoyānas, a thousand Uttarakurus, a thousand Pubbavidchas, ${ }^{513}$ and a thousand four great oceans; a thousand four great kings, a thousand [heavens] of devas [ruled by] the four great kings, a thousand Tāvatimsa [heavens], a thousand [228] Yāma [heavens], a thousand Tusita [heavens], a thousand
[heavens] of devas who delight in creation, a thousand [heavens] of devas who control what is created by others, a thousand brahmā worlds.

(2) "A world that is a thousand times a thousandfold minor world system is called a thousand-to-the-second-power middling world system. ${ }^{514}$ (3) A world that is a thousand times a thousand-to-the-second-power middling world system is called a thousand-to-the-third-power great world system. Ānanda, the Tathāgata can convey his voice as far as he wants in a thousand-to-the-third-power great world system."

"But in what way, Bhante, can the Tathāgata convey his voice as far as he wants in a thousand-to-the-third-power great world system?"

"Here, Ānanda, the Tathāgata suffuses with his radiance a thousand-to-the-third-power great world system. When those beings perceive that light, then the Tathāgata projects his voice and makes them hear its sound. It is in such a way, Ānanda, that the Tathāgata can convey his voice as far as he wants in a thousand-to-the-third-power great world system." ${ }^{1515}$

When this was said, the Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: "It is my good fortune! I am very fortunate that my Teacher is so powerful and mighty."

When this was said, the Venerable Udāyī said to the Venerable Ānanda: "What is it to you, friend Ānanda, that your Teacher is so powerful and mighty?"516

When this was said, the Blessed One said to the Venerable Udāyī: "Do not say so, Udāyī! Do not say so, Udāyī! ${ }^{517}$ Udāyī, if Ānanda were to die without being free of lust, then because of his confidence he would exercise celestial kingship among the devas seven times and great kingship in this Jambudīpa seven times. However, in this very life Ānanda will attain final nibbāna." [229]

# IV. ASCETICS

## 81 (1) Ascetics

"Bhikkhus, there are these three ascetic tasks to be practiced by an ascetic. What three? (1) The undertaking of the training in the higher virtuous behavior, (2) the undertaking of the training in the higher mind, and (3) the undertaking of the training in the
higher wisdom. These are the three ascetic tasks to be practiced by an ascetic.

"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will have a keen desire to undertake the training in the higher virtuous behavior; we will have a keen desire to undertake the training in the higher mind; we will have a keen desire to undertake the training in the higher wisdom.' It is in this way that you should train yourselves."

# 82 (2) The Donkey ${ }^{316}$

"Bhikkhús, suppose a donkey was following right behind a herd of cattle, [thinking]: 'I'm a cow too, I'm a cow too. ${ }^{519}$ (1) But his appearance would not be like that of the cows, (2) his braying would not be like that of the cows, and (3) his footprint would not be like that of the cows. Yet he follows right behind a herd of cattle, [thinking]: 'I'm a cow too, I'm a cow too.'

"So too, a bhikkhu might be following rightbehind the Sangha of bhikkhús, [thinking]: 'I'm a bhikkhu too, I'm a bhikkhu too.' (1) But his desire to undertake the training in the higher virtuous behavior is not like that of the other bhikkhus; (2) his desire to undertake the training in the higher mind is not like that of the other bhikkhus; (3) his desire to undertake the training in the higher wisdom is not like that of the other bhikkhus. Yet he follows right behind the Sangha of bhikkhus, [thinking]: 'I'm a bhikkhu too, I'm a bhikkhu too.'

"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will have a keen desire to undertake the training in the higher virtuous behavior; we will have a keen desire to undertake the training in the higher mind; we will have a keen desire to undertake the training in the higher wisdom.' It is in this way that you should train yourselves."

## 83 (3) The Field

"Bhikkhus, there are these three preliminary tasks of a farmer. What three? (1) Here, the farmer first of all thoroughly plows and harrows the field. (2) Next, he sows seeds at the proper time. (3) And then he occasionally irrigates [230] and drains the field. These are the three preliminary tasks of a farmer.

"So too, bhikkhus, there are these three preliminary tasks of a bhikkhu. What three? (1) The undertaking of the training in
the higher virtuous behavior, (2) the undertaking of the training in the higher mind, and (3) the undertaking of the training in the higher wisdom. These are the three preliminary tasks of a bhikkhu.

"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will have a keen desire to undertake the training in the higher virtuous behavior... the training in the higher mind... the training in the higher wisdom.' It is in this way that you should train yourselves."

# 84 (4) The Young Vajji

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then a certain Vajji bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and said to him:

"Bhante, every half-month more than a hundred and fifty training rules come up for recitation. I cannot train in them."

"Can you train in the three trainings, bhikkhu: the training in the higher virtuous behavior, the training in the higher mind, and the training in the higher wisdom?"

"I can, Bhante."

"Therefore, bhikkhu, train in the three trainings: the training in the higher virtuous behavior, the training in the higher mind, and the training in the higher wisdom. As you train in them, you will abandon lust, hatred, and delusion. With the abandoning of lust, hatred, and delusion, you will do nothing unwholesome or resort to anything bad."

Then, sometime later, that bhikkhu trained in the higher virtuous behavior, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom. As he [231] trained in them, he abandoned lust, hatred, and delusion. With the abandoning of lust, hatred, and delusion, he did nothing unwholesome and did not resort to anything bad.

## 85 (5) A Trainee

Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One . . . and said to him: "Bhante, it is said: 'A trainee, a trainee.' In what way is one a trainee?"

"He trains, bhikkhu, therefore he is called a trainee. And in what does he train? He trains in the higher virtuous behavior; he trains in the higher mind; he trains in the higher wisdom. He trains, bhikkhu, therefore he is called a trainee."

As the trainee trains along the straight path, the knowledge of destruction arises first immediately followed by final knowledge. ${ }^{520}$

Thereafter, when the fetters of existence are destroyed, for one liberated by final knowledge, the knowledge arises:

"My liberation is unshakable." ${ }^{521}$

86 (6) The Process of Training (1)

"Bhikkhus, every half-month more than a hundred and fifty training rules come up for recitation; clansmen who desire their own good train in these. These are all comprised within these three trainings. What three? The training in the higher virtuous behavior, the training in the higher mind, and the training in the higher wisdom. These are the three trainings in which all this is comprised.

"Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu fulfills virtuous behavior, but cultivates concentration and wisdom only to a moderate extent. He falls into offenses in regard to the lesser and minor training rules and rehabilitates himself. ${ }^{522}$ For what reason? Because I have not said that he is incapable of this. ${ }^{523}$ But in regard to those training rules that are fundamental to the spiritual life, in conformity with the spiritual life, ${ }^{524}$ his behavior is constant and steadfast. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. With the utter destruction of three fetters, [232] he is a stream-enterer, no longer subject to [rebirth in] the lower world, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as his destination.

"Another bhikkhu fulfills virtuous behavior, but cultivates concentration and wisdom only to a moderate extent. He falls into offenses in regard to the lesser and minor training rules and rehabilitates himself. For what reason? Because I have not said that he is incapable of this. But in regard to those training rules that are fundamental to the spiritual life, in conformity with the spiritual life, his behavior is constant and steadfast. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. With the utter destruction of three fetters and with the diminishing of greed, hatred, and delusion, he is a once-returner who, after coming back to this world only one more time, will make an end of suffering.
"Another bhikkhu fulfills virtuous behavior and concentration, but cultivates wisdom only to a moderate extent. He falls into offenses in regard to the lesser and minor training rules and rehabilitates himself. For what reason? Because I have not said that he is incapable of this. But in regard to those training rules that are fundamental to the spiritual life, in conformity with the spiritual life, his behavior is constant and steadfast. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, he is one of spontaneous birth, due to attain final nibbāna there without returning from that world.

"Another bhikkhu fulfills virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom. He falls into offenses in regard to the lesser and minor training rules and rehabilitates himself. For what reason? Because I have not said that he is incapable of this. But in regard to those training rules that are fundamental to the spiritual life, in conformity with the spiritual life, his behavior is constant and steadfast. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. With the destruction of the taints, he realizes for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.

"Thus, bhikkhus, one who cultivates in part succeeds in part; one who cultivates fully reaches fulfillment. These training rules, I say, are not barren."

# 87 (7) The Process of Training (2)

"Bhikkhus, every half-month more than a hundred and fifty training rules come up for recitation; clansmen who desire their own good [233] train in these. These are all comprised within these three trainings. What three? The training in the higher virtuous behavior, the training in the higher mind, and the training in the higher wisdom. These are the three trainings in which all this is comprised.

"Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu fulfills virtuous behavior, but cultivates concentration and wisdom only to a moderate extent. He falls into offenses in regard to the lesser and minor training rules and rehabilitates himself. For what reason? Because I have not said that he is incapable of this. But in regard to those training rules that are fundamental to the spiritual life, in conformity with the spiritual life, his behavior is constant and
steadfast. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. With the utter destruction of three fetters, he is a seven-times-at-most attainer who, after roaming and wandering on among devas and humans seven times at most, makes an end of suffering. ${ }^{525}$ With the utter destruction of three fetters, he is a family-to-family attainer who, after roaming and wandering on among good families two or three times, makes an end of suffering. With the utter destruction of three fetters, he is a one-seed attainer who, after being reborn once more in human existence, makes an end of suffering. With the utter destruction of three fetters and with the diminishing of greed, hatred, and delusion, he is a once-returner who, after coming back to this world only one more time, makes an end of suffering.

"Another bhikkhu fulfills virtuous behavior and concentration, but cultivates wisdom only to a moderate extent. He falls into offenses in regard to the lesser and minor training rules and rehabilitates himself. For what reason? Because I have not said that he is incapable of this. But in regard to those training rules that are fundamental to the spiritual life, in conformity with the spiritual life, his behavior is constant and steadfast. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, he is one bound upstream, heading toward the Akaniṭtha realm... an attainer of nibbāna through exertion... an attainer of nibbāna without exertion... an attainer of nibbāna upon landing... an attainer of nibbāna in the interval. ${ }^{526}$

"Another bhikkhu fulfills virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom. He [234] falls into offenses in regard to the lesser and minor training rules and rehabilitates himself. For what reason? Because I have not said that he is incapable of this. But in regard to those training rules that are fundamental to the spiritual life, in conformity with the spiritual life, his behavior is constant and steadfast. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. With the destruction of the taints, he realizes for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.

"Thus, bhikkhus, one who cultivates in part succeeds in part; one who cultivates fully reaches fulfillment. These training rules, I say, are not barren."

88 (8) The Process of Training (3)

"Bhikkhus, every half-month more than a hundred and fifty training rules come up for recitation; clansmen who desire their own good train in these.

"If he does not attain and penetrate this, ${ }^{527}$ with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, he is an attainer of nibbāna in the interval. If he does not attain and penetrate this, with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, he is an attainer of nibbāna upon landing... an attainer of nibbāna without exertion... an attainer of nibbāna through exertion... one bound upstream, heading toward the Akaniṭtha realm.

"If he does not attain and penetrate this, with the utter destruction of three fetters and with the diminishing of greed, hatred, and delusion, he is a once-returner who, after coming back to this [235] world only one more time, makes an end of suffering. If he does not attain and penetrate this, with the utter destruction of three fetters, he is a one-seed attainer who, after being reborn once more in human existence, makes an end of suffering. If he does not attain and penetrate this, with the utter destruction of three fetters, he is a family-to-family attainer who, after roaming and wandering on among good families two or three times, makes an end of suffering. If he does not attain and penetrate this, with the utter destruction of three fetters, he is a seven-times-at-most attainer who, after roaming and wandering on among devas and humans seven times at most, makes an end of suffering.
"Thus, bhikkhus, one who cultivates fully reaches fulfillment; one who cultivates in part succeeds in part. These training rules, I say, are not barren."

89 (9) The Trainings (1)

"Bhikkhus, there are these three trainings. What three? The training in the higher virtuous behavior, the training in the higher mind, and the training in the higher wisdom.

"And what, bhikkhus, is the training in the higher virtuous behavior? Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous. . . . Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. This is called the training in the higher virtuous behavior.

"And what, bhikkhus, is the training in the higher mind? Here, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna... the fourth jhāna.... This is called the training in the higher mind.

"And what, bhikkhus, is the training in the higher wisdom? Here, a bhikkhu understands as it really is: 'This is suffering'... 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' This is called the training in the higher wisdom.

"These, bhikkhus, are the three trainings."

90 (10) The Trainings (2)

"Bhikkhus, there are these three trainings. What three? The training in the higher virtuous behavior, the training in the higher mind, and the training in the higher wisdom.

"And what, bhikkhus, is the training in the higher virtuous behavior? Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous.... Having underiaken the training rules, he trains in them. This is called the training in the higher virtuous behavior.

"And what, bhikkhus, is the training in the higher mind? Here, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna... [236] the fourth jhāna.... This is called the training in the higher mind.

"And what, bhikkhus, is the training in the higher wisdom? Here, with the destruction of the taints, a bhikkhu realizes for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.
"These, bhikkhus, are the three trainings."

Energetic, strong, and resolute, meditative, mindful, the faculties guarded, one should practice the higher virtue, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom.

As before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below;

as by day, so at night; as at night, so by day, having overcome all quarters, with measureless concentration. ${ }^{528}$

They call him a trainee on the path, whose conduct has been well purified. They call him enlightened in the world, a wise one who has fulfilled the practice. ${ }^{529}$

For one freed by craving's destruction, with the cessation of consciousness the emancipation of the mind is like the extinguishing of a lamp. ${ }^{530}$

# 91 (11) Pañkadhā

On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Sangha of bhikkhus when he reached the Kosalan town of Pankadhā. He then dwelled near Pankadhā.

Now on that occasion the bhikkhu Kassapagotta was resident at Pankadhā. There the Blessed One instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk connected with the training rules. Then, while the Blessed One was instructing . . . and gladdening the bhikkhus with a talk on the Dhamma connected with the training rules, the bhikkhu Kassapagotta became impatient and bitter, [thinking]: "This ascetic is too stringent." ${ }^{\prime 531}$

Then, having dwelled at Pankadhā as long as he wanted,
the Blessed One set out on tour toward Rājagaha. Wandering on tour, the Blessed One eventually arrived at Rājagaha. [237] There, at Rājagaha, the Blessed One dwelled on Mount Vulture Peak. Then, not long after the Blessed One had left, the bhikkhu Kassapagotta was filled with remorse and regret, [thinking]: "It is my misfortune and loss that when the Blessed One was instructing, encouraging, inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk connected with the training rules, I became impatient and bitter, [thinking]: 'This ascetic is too stringent.' Let me now go to the Blessed One and confess my transgression to him."

Then the bhikkhu Kassapagotta cleaned up his lodging, took his bowl and robe, and set out for Rājagaha. Eventually he arrived at Rājagaha and went to Mount Vulture Peak. He approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:

"Bhante, on one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at the Kosalan town of Pankadhā. There the Blessed One instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk connected with the training rules. While he was instructing . . . and gladdening them, I became impatient and bitter, thinking: 'This ascetic is too stringent.' Then, having dwelled at Pankadhā as long as he wanted, the Blessed One set out on tour for Rājagaha. Not long after he left, I was filled with remorse and regret, thinking: 'It is my misfortune and loss that when the Blessed One was instructing... and gladdening the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk connected with the training rules, I became impatient and bitter, thinking: "This ascetic is too stringent." Let me now go to the Blessed One and confess my transgression to him.'

"Bhante, I have committed a transgression [238] in that, when the Blessed One was instructing, encouraging, inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk connected with the training rules, I so foolishly, stupidly, and unskillfully became impatient and bitter, thinking: 'This ascetic is too stringent.' Bhante, may the Blessed One accept my transgression seen as a transgression for the sake of future restraint."

"Surely, Kassapa, you have committed a transgression in that, when I was instructing, encouraging, inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus with a talk on the Dhamma connected with the training rules, you so foolishly, stupidly, and unskillfully became
impatient and bitter, thinking: 'This ascetic is too stringent.' But since you see your transgression as a transgression and make amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma, we accept it. For it is growth in the Noble One's discipline that one sees one's transgression as a transgression, makes amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma, and undertakes future restraint.

(1) "If, Kassapa, an elder bhikkhu ${ }^{532}$ does not desire to train and does not speak praise of undertaking the training; if he does not encourage in the training other bhikkhus who do not desire to train; and if he does not speak genuine, real, and timely praise of. those bhikkhus who desire to train, I do not speak praise of such an elder bhikkhu. For what reason? Because other bhikkhus, [hearing]: 'The Teacher speaks praise of him,' might associate with him, and those who associate with him might follow his example. If they follow his example, this would lead to their harm and suffering for a long time. Therefore I do not speak praise of such an elder bhikkhu.

(2) "If, Kassapa, a bhikkhu of middle standing... (3) If a junior bhikkhu does not desire to train and does not speak praise of undertaking the training; if he does not encourage in the training other bhikkhus who do not desire to train; and if he does not speak genuine, real, and timely praise of those bhikkhus who desire to train, I do not speak praise of such a junior bhikkhu. For what reason? Because other bhikkhus, [hearing]: 'The Teacher speaks praise of him,' might associate with him, and those who associate with him [239] might follow his example. If they follow his example, this would lead to their harm and suffering for a long time. Therefore I do not speak praise of such a junior bhikkhu.

For what reason? Because other bhikkhus, [hearing]: 'The Teacher speaks praise of him,' might associate with him, and those who associate with him might follow his example. If they follow his example, this would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time. Therefore I speak praise of such an elder bhikkhu.

# V. A LUMP OF SALT ${ }^{333}$

## 92 (1) Urgent

"Bhikkhus, there are these three urgent tasks of a farmer. ${ }^{334}$ What three? (1) First, the farmer swiftly yet thoroughly plows the field and swiftly yet thoroughly harrows it. (2) Next, he swiftly sows seeds. (3) And then he swiftly [240] irrigates and drains the field. These are the three urgent tasks of a farmer.

"This farmer has no psychic potency or spiritual might [by which he could command]: 'Let my crops start growing today! Let them mature tomorrow! Let them bear grain the day after tomorrow!' But, with the change of seasons, there comes a time when the crops grow, mature, and bear grain.

"So too, bhikkhus, there are these three urgent tasks of a bhikkhu. What three? (1) The undertaking of the training in the higher virtuous behavior, (2) the undertaking of the training in the higher mind, and (3) the undertaking of the training in the higher wisdom. These are the three urgent tasks of a bhikkhu.

"This bhikkhu has no psychic potency or spiritual might [by which he could command]: 'Let my mind be liberated from the taints by non-clinging today, or tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow!' Rather, as this bhikkhu trains in the higher virtuous behavior, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom, there comes an occasion when his mind is liberated from the taints by nonclinging.

"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will have a keen desire to undertake the training in the
higher virtuous behavior, the training in the higher mind, and the training in the higher wisdom.' It is in this way that you should train yourselves."

# 93 (2) Solitude

"Bhikkhus, wanderers of other sects prescribe these three kinds of solitude. What three? Solitude with respect to robes, solitude with respect to almsfood, and solitude with respect to lodgings. ${ }^{335}$

"This, bhikkhus, is what wanderers of other sects prescribe as solitude with respect to robes: they wear hemp robes, robes of hemp-mixed cloth, shroud robes, rag-robes; robes made from tree bark, antelope hides, strips of antelope hide; robes of kusa grass, bark fabric, or wood-shavings fabric; a blanket made of head hair or of animal wool, [241] a covering made of owls' wings. That is what wanderers of other sects prescribe as solitude with respect to robes.

"This is what wanderers of other sects prescribe as solitude with respect to almsfood: they eat greens, millet, forest rice, hide-parings, moss, rice bran, the scum of rice, sesamum flour, grass, or cow dung. They subsist on forest roots and fruits; they feed on fallen fruits. That is what wanderers of other sects prescribe as solitude with respect to almsfood.

"This is what wanderers of other sects prescribe as solitude with respect to lodgings: a forest, the foot of a tree, a charnel ground, remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves, the open air, a heap of straw, a chaff-house. That is what wanderers of other sects prescribe as solitude with respect to lodgings.

"These are the three kinds of solitude that wanderers of other sects prescribe.

"In this Dhamma and discipline, bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of solitude for a bhikkhu. What three?

"Here, (1) a bhikkhu is virtuous; he has abandoned immorality and remains secluded from it. (2) He holds right view; he has abandoned wrong view and remains secluded from it. ${ }^{336}$ (3) He is one whose taints are destroyed; he has abandoned the taints and remains secluded from them.

"When a bhikkhu is virtuous, one who has abandoned immorality and remains secluded from it; when he is one of right view, who has abandoned wrong view and remains secluded
from it; when he is one whose taints are destroyed, who has abandoned the taints and remains secluded from them, he is then called a bhikkhu who has attained the foremost, attained the core, one who is pure and established in the core.

"Suppose, bhikkhus, there is a farmer whose field of hill rice has ripened. The farmer would swiftly have the plants cut. Then he would swiftly have the plants collected. Then he would swiftly [242] have them transported [to the threshing place]. Then he would swiftly pile them'up, have them threshed, get the straw removed, get the chaff removed, and winnow it. Then he would swiftly have it brought over, get it pounded, and get the husks removed. In this way, the farmer's grains of rice would be foremost, attained the core, pure, and established in the core.

"So too, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhú is virtuous . . . one of right view . . . one who has abandoned the taints and remains secluded from them, he is then called a bhikkhú who is foremost, attained the core, pure, and established in the core."

# 94 (3) Autumn ${ }^{537}$

"Bhikkhus, just as, in the autumn, when the sky is clear and cloudless, the sun, ascending in the sky, dispels all darkness from space as it shines and beams and radiates, so too, when the dust-free, stainless Dhamma-eye arises in the noble disciple, then, together with the arising of vision, the noble disciple abandons three fetters: personal-existence view, doubt, and wrong grasp of behavior and observances. ${ }^{538}$

"Afterward, when he departs from two states, longing and ill will, then, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. If, bhikkhus, the noble disciple should pass away on that occasion, there is no fetter bound by which he might return to this world. ${ }^{\text {"539 }}$

## 95 (4) Assemblies

"Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of assemblies. ${ }^{540}$ What three? The assembly of the foremost, the divided assembly, and the harmonious assembly. [243]

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the assembly of the foremost?

Here, in this kind of assembly the elder bhikkhus do not become luxurious and lax, but discard backsliding and take the lead in solitude; they arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yetunattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. [Those in] the next generation follow their example. They too do not become luxurious and lax, but discard backsliding and take the lead in solitude; they too arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yetunattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. This is called the assembly of the foremost.

(2) "And what is the divided assembly? Here, the assembly in which the bhikkhus take to arguing and quarreling and fall into disputes, stabbing each other with piercing words, is called the divided assembly.

(3) "And what is the harmonious assembly? Here, the assembly in which the bhikkhus dwell in concord, harmoniously, without disputes, blending like milk and water, viewing each other with eyes of affection, is called the harmonious assembly.

"When the bhikkhus dwell in concord, harmoniously, without disputes, blending like milk and water, viewing each other with eyes of affection, on that occasion they generate much merit. On that occasion the bhikkhus dwell in a divine abode, that is, in the liberation of mind through altruistic joy. When one is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated.

"Just as, when it is raining and the rain pours down in thick droplets on a mountain top, the water flows down along the slope and fills the clefts, gullies, and creeks; these, becoming full, fill up the pools; these, becoming full, fill up the lakes; these, becoming full, fill up the streams; these, becoming full, fill up the rivers; and these, becoming full, fill up the ocean; so too, when the bhikkhus dwell in concord, harmoniously, without disputes, blending like milk and water, viewing each other [244] with eyes of affection, on that occasion they generate much merit. On that occasion the bhikkhus dwell in a divine abode, that is, in the liberation of mind through altruistic joy. When one is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated:
"These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of assemblies."

# 96 (5) Thoroughbred (1)

"Bhikkhus, possessing three factors a king's excellent thoroughbred horse is worthy of a king, an accessory of a king, and reckoned as a factor of kingship. What three? Here, a king's excellent thoroughbred horse possesses beauty, strength, and speed. Possessing these three factors, a king's excellent thoroughbred horse is ... reckoned as a factor of kingship.

"So too, possessing three qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings; worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What three? Here, a bhikkhu possesses beauty, strength, and speed.

(1) "And how does a bhikkhu possess beauty? Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort; seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. It is in this way that a bhikkhu possesses beauty.

(2) "And how does a bhikkhu possess strength? Here, a bhikkhu arouses energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities. It is in this way that a bhikkhu possesses strength.

(3) "And how does a bhikkhu possess speed? Here, a bhikkhu understands as it really is: 'This is suffering,' and 'This is the origin of suffering, [245] and 'This is the cessation of suffering,' and 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' It is in this way that a bhikkhu possesses speed.

"Possessing these three qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

## 97 (6) Thoroughbred (2)

[All as in 3:96, with only the following difference in factor (3):]

"And how does a bhikkhu possess speed? Here, with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, a bhikkhu is one of spontaneous birth, due to attain final nibbäna there without ever returning from that world. It is in this way that a bhikkhu possesses speed.
"Possessing these three qualities, a bhikkhu is ... an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

# 98 (7) Thoroughbred (3)

[All as in 3:96, with only the following difference in factor (3):] [246]

"And how does a bhikkhu possess speed? Here, with the destruction of the taints, a bhikkhu has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. It is in this way that a bhikkhu possesses speed.

"Possessing these three qualities, a bhikkhu is ... an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

## 99 (8) Bark Fabric

"Bhikkhus, when it is new, cloth made of bark fabric ${ }^{541}$ is ugly, uncomfortable, and of little value. When it has been worn, ${ }^{542}$ cloth made of bark fabric is ugly, uncomfortable, and of little value. When it is old, cloth made of bark fabric is still ugly, uncomfortable, and of little value. They use old cloth made of bark fabric for cleaning pots or they discard it on a rubbish heap.

(1) (i) ${ }^{543}$ "So too, bhikkhus, if a junior bhikkhu is immoral, of bad character, this, I say, counts as his ugliness. [247] Just as cloth made of bark fabric is ugly, so, I say, this person is similar.

(ii) "For those who associate with him, resort to him, attend on him, and follow his example, this leads to their harm and suffering for a long time. This, I say, counts as his uncomfortableness. Just as cloth made of bark fabric is uncomfortable, so, I say, this person is similar.

(iii) "When he accepts a robe, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick, this [acceptance] is not of great fruit and benefit for those [who offer such things]. This, I say, counts as his being of little value. Just as cloth made of bark fabric is of little value, so, I say, this person is similar.

(2) "If a bhikkhu of middle standing...

(3) "If an elder bhikkhư is immoral, of bad character, this, I say, counts as his ugliness. 5 : : [all as above] . . Just as cloth made of bark fabric is of little value, so, I say, this person is similar.

"If such an elder bhikkhu speaks in the midst of the Sangha,
the bhikkhus say to him: 'What gives you, an incompetent fool, the right to speak? Do you think you too are entitled to speak?' He then becomes angry and displeased and utters speech on account of which the Sangha expels him, as if [discarding] the clothing made of bark fabric on the rubbish heap. ${ }^{54}$

"When it is new, bhikkhus, cloth from Kāsi is beautiful, comfortable, and of great value. When it has been worn, [248] cloth from Kāsi is beautiful, comfortable, and of great value. When it is old, cloth from Kāsi is beautiful, comfortable, and of great value. They use old cloth from Kāsi as a.wrapping for gems or they deposit it in a fragrant casket.

(1) (i) "So too, if a junior bhikkhu is virtuous, of good character, this, I say, counts as his beauty. Just as cloth from Kāsi is beautiful, so, I say, this person is similar.

(ii) "For those who associate with him, resort to him, attend on him, and follow his example, this leads to their welfare and happiness for a long time. This, I say, counts as his comfortableness. Just as cloth from Kāsi is comfortable, so, I say, this person is similar.

(iii) "When he accepts a robe, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick, this [acceptance] is of great fruit and benefit for those [who offer such things]. This, I say, counts as his being of great value. Just as cloth from Kāsi is of great value, so, I say, this person is similar.

(2) "If a bhikkhu of middle standing...

(3) "If an elder bhikkhu is virtuous, of good character, this, I say, counts as his beauty. . . [all as above] . . Just as cloth from Kāsi is of great value, so, I say, this person is similar.

"If such an elder bhikkhu speaks in the midst of the Sangha, [249] the bhikkhus say: 'Please let the venerable ones be quiet. An elder bhikkhu is speaking on the Dhamma and the discipline.' Those words of his should be preserved, just as they deposit a cloth from Kāsi in a fragrant casket. ${ }^{545}$

"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will be like cloth from Kāsi, not like cloth made of bark fabric.' It is in such a way that you should train yourselves."

100 (9) A Lump of Salt

"Bhikkhus, if one were to say thus: 'A person experiences kamma in precisely the same way that he created it,' in such a case there could be no living of the spiritual life and no opportunity would
be seen for completely making an end of suffering. ${ }^{546}$ But if one were to say thus: 'When a person creates kamma that is to be experienced in a particular way, he experiences its result precisely in that way,' in such a case the living of the spiritual life is possible and an opportunity is seen for completely making an end of suffering. ${ }^{547}$

"Here, bhikkhus, some person has created trifling bad kamma yet it leads him to hell, while some other person here has created exactly the same trifling kamma yet it is to be experienced in this very life, without even a slight [residue] being seen, much less abundant [residue].

"What kind of person creates trifling bad kamma that leads him to hell? Here, some person is undeveloped in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom; he is limited and has a mean character, ${ }^{548}$ and he dwells in suffering. ${ }^{549}$ When such a person creates trifling bad kamma, it leads him to hell.

"What kind of person creates exactly the same trifling bad kamma and yet it is to be experienced in this very life, without even a slight [residue] being seen, much less abundant [residue]? Here, some person is developed in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom. He is unlimited and has a lofty character, and he dwells without measure. ${ }^{550}$ When such a person creates exactly the same trifling bad kamma, it is to be experienced in this very life, without even a slight [residue] being seen, much less abundant [residue]. ${ }^{551}$ [250]

(1) "Suppose a man would drop a lump of salt into a small bowl of water. What do you think, bhikkhus? Would that lump of salt make the small quantity of water in the bowl ${ }^{552}$ salty and undrinkable?"

"Yes, Bhante. For what reason? Because the water in the bowl is limited, thus that lump of salt would make it salty and undrinkable."

"But suppose a man would drop a lump of salt into the river Ganges. What do you think, bhikkhus? Would that lump of salt make the river Ganges become salty and undrinkable?"

"No, Bhante. For what reason? Because the river Ganges contains a large volume of water, thus that lump of salt would not make it salty and undrinkable."

"So too, bhikkhus, some person here has created trifling bad kamma yet it leads him to hell, while some other person here
has created exactly the same trifling kamma yet it is to be experienced in this very life, without even a slight [residue] being seen, much less abundant [residue].

"What kind of person creates trifling bad kamma that leads him to hell? Here, some person is undeveloped in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom. When such a person creates a trifling bad kamma, it leads him to hell.

"What kind of person creates exactly the same trifling bad kamma and yet it is to be experienced in this very life, without even a slight [residue] being seen, much less an abundant [residue]? Here, some person is developed in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom. When such a person has created exactly the same trifling bad kamma, it is to be experienced in this very life, without even a slight [residue] being seen, much less abundant [residue].

(2) "Here, bhikkhus, someone is imprisoned for [stealing] half a kahāpana, a kahāpana, [251] or a hundred kahāpanas, ${ }^{553}$ while someone else is not imprisoned for [stealing] the same amount of money.

"What kind of person is imprisoned for [stealing] half a kahāpana, a kahāpana, or a hundred kahāpanas? Here, someone is poor, with little property and wealth. Such a person is imprisoned for [stealing] half a kahāpana, a kahāpana, or a hundred kahāpanas.

"What kind of person is not imprisoned for [stealing] half a kahāpana, a kahāpana, or a hundred kahāpanas? Here, someone is rich, with much money and wealth. Such a person is not imprisoned for [stealing] half a kahāpana, a kahāpana, or a hundred kahāpanas.

"So too, bhikkhus, some person has created trifling bad kamma yet it leads him to hell, while some other person here has created exactly the same trifling kamma yet it is to be experienced in this very life, without even a slight [residue] being seen, much less abundant [residue].

"What kind of person creates trifling bad kamma that leads him to hell? Here, some person is undeveloped in body ... and wisdom. When such a person has created trifling bad kamma, it leads him to hell.

"What kind of person creates exactly the same trifling bad kamma and yet it is to be experienced in this very life, without
even a slight [residue] being seen, much less an abundant [residue]? Here, some person is developed in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom. When such a person has created exactly the same trifling bad kamma, it is to be experienced in this very life, without even a slight [residue] being seen, much less abundant [residue].

(3) "Bhikkhus, take the case of a sheep merchant or butcher, [252] who can execute, imprison, fine, or otherwise penalize someone who has stolen one of his sheep but can't do so to someone else who has stolen his sheep.

"What kind of person ${ }^{584}$ can the sheep merchant or butcher execute, imprison, fine, or otherwise penalize for stealing a sheep? One who is poor, with little property and wealth. The sheep merchant or butcher can execute, imprison, fine, or otherwise penalize such a person for stealing a sheep.

"What kind of person can't the sheep merchant or butcher execute, imprison, fine, or otherwise penalize for stealing a sheep? One who is rich, with a lot of money and wealth, a king or royal minister. The sheep merchant or butcher can't execute, imprison, fine, or otherwise penalize such a person for stealing a sheep; he can only plead with him: 'Sir, return my sheep or pay me for it.'

"So too, bhikkhus, some person has created trifling bad kamma yet it leads him to hell, while some other person here has created exactly the same trifling kamma yet it is to be experienced in this very life, without even a slight [residue] being seen, much less abundant [residue].

"What kind of person creates trifling bad kamma that leads him to hell? Here, some person is undeveloped in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom; he is limited and has a mean character, and he dwells in suffering. When such kind of [253] person has created a trifling bad kamma, it leads him to hell.

"What kind of person creates exactly the same trifling bad kamma and yet it is to be experienced in this very life, without even a slight [residue] being seen, much less an abundant [residue]? Here, some person is developed in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom. He is unlimited and has a lofty character, and he dwells without measure. When such a person has created exactly the same trifling bad kamma, it is to be experienced in this very life, without even a slight [residue] being seen, much less abundant [residue].
"If, bhikkhus, one were to say thus: ' $\Lambda$ person experiences kamma in precisely the same way that he created it,' in such a case there could be no living of the spiritual life and no opportunity would be seen for completely making an end of suffering. But if one were to say thus: 'When a person creates kamma that is to be experienced in a particular way, he experiences its result precisely in that way,' in such a case the living of the spiritual life is possible and an opportunity is seen for completely making an end of suffering."

# 101 (10) The Soil Remover

"Bhikkhus, there are gross defilements of gold: soil, grit, and gravel. Now the soil remover or his apprentice first pours the gold into a trough and washes, rinses, and cleans it. When that has been removed and eliminated, there still remain middlesize defilements in the gold: fine grit and coarse sand. The soil remover or his apprentice washes, rinses, and cleans it again. When that has been removed and eliminated, there still remain subtle defilements in the gold: fine sand and black dust. So the soil remover or his apprentice washes, rinses, and cleans it again. When that has been removed and eliminated, only grains of gold remain.

"The goldsmith or his apprentice now pours the gold into a melting pot, and fans it, melts it, [254] and smelts it. But even when this has been done, the gold is not yet settled and the dross has not yet been entirely removed. ${ }^{555}$ The gold is not yet malleable, wieldy, and luminous, but still brittle and not properly fit for work.

"But as the goldsmith or his apprentice continues to fan, melt, and smelt the gold, a time comes when the gold is settled and the dross has been entirely removed, so that the gold becomes malleable, wieldy, and luminous, pliant and properly fit for work. Then whatever kind of ornament the goldsmith wishes to make from it-whether a bracelet, earrings, a necklace, or a golden garland-he can achieve his purpose.

"So too, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is devoted to the higher mind, (1) there are in him gross defilements: bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct. An earnest, capable bhikkhu abandons, dispels, terminates, and obliterates them. When this has been done, (2) there remain in him middling defilements: sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of harming. An
earnest, capable bhikkhu abandons, dispels, terminates, and obliterates them. When this has been done, (3) there remain in him subtle defilements: thoughts about his relations, ${ }^{556}$ thoughts about his country, and thoughts about his reputation. ${ }^{557}$ An earnest, capable bhikkhu abandons, dispels, terminates, and obliterates them. When this has been done, then there remain thoughts connected with the Dhamma. ${ }^{558}$ That concentration is not peaceful and sublime, not gained by full tranquilization, ${ }^{559}$ not attained to unification, but is reined in and checked by forcefully suppressing [the defilements]. ${ }^{560}$

"But, bhikkhus, there comes a time when his mind becomes internally steady, composed, unified, and concentrated. That concentration is peaceful and sublime, gained by full tranquilization, and attained to unification; it is not reined in and checked by forcefully suppressing [the defilements]. ${ }^{561}$.Then, there being a suitable basis, he is capable of realizing any state realizable by direct knowledge toward which he might incline his mind. ${ }^{562}$ [255]

"If he wishes: ${ }^{563}$ 'May I wield the various kinds of psychic potency: having been one, may I become many; having been many, may I become one; may I appear and vanish; may I go unhindered through a wall, through a rampart, through a mountain as though through space; may I dive in and out of the earth as though it were water; may I walk on water without sinking as though it were earth; seated cross-legged, may I travel in space like a bird; with my hand may I touch and stroke the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; may I exercise mastery with the body as far as the brahmā world,' he is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.

"If he wishes: 'May I, with the divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the human, hear both kinds of sounds, the divine and human, those that are far as well as near,' he is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.

# 102 (11) A Goldsmith ${ }^{565}$

"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is devoted to the higher mind, from time to time he should give attention to three marks. ${ }^{566}$ (1) From time to time he should give attention to the mark of concentration, (2) from time to time to the mark of exertion, and (3) from time to time to the mark of equanimity.

"If a bhikkhu devoted to the higher mind attends exclusively to the mark of concentration, it is possible that his mind will veer toward laziness. If he attends exclusively to the mark of exertion, it is possible that his mind will veer toward restlessness. If [257] he attends exclusively to the mark of equanimity, it is possible that his mind will not be pi operly concentrated for the destruction of the taints. But when a bhikkhu devoted to the higher mind from time to time gives attention to the mark of concentration, from time to time to the mark of exertion, and from time to time to the mark of equanimity, his mind becomes malleable, wieldy, and luminous, pliant and properly concentrated for the destruction of the taints.

"Suppose, bhikkhus, a goldsmith or his apprentice would prepare a furnace, heat up the crucible, take some gold with tongs, and put it into the crucible. Then from time to time he would blow on it, from time to time sprinkle water over it, and from time to time just look on. If the goldsmith or his apprentice were to exclusively blow on the gold, it is possible that the gold would just burn up. If he were to exclusively sprinkle water on the gold, it is possible the gold would cool down. If he were exclusively to just look on, it is possible the gold would not reach the right consistency. But if the goldsmith or his apprentice from time to time blows on it, from time to time sprinkles water over it, and from time to time just looks on, the gold would become malleable, wieldy, and luminous, pliant and properly fit for work. Then whatever kind of ornament the goldsmith wishes to make from it-whether a bracelet, earrings, a necklace, or a golden garland-he can achieve his purpose.

"So too, when a bhikkhu is devoted to the higher mind, from time to time he should give attention to three marks. From time
to time he should give attention to the mark of concentration, from time to time to the mark of exertion, and from time to time to the mark of equanimity.

"If a bhikkhu devoted to the higher mind attends exclusively to the mark of concentration, [258] it is possible that his mind will veer toward laziness. If he attends exclusively to the mark of exertion, it is possible that his mind will veer toward restlessness. If he attends exclusively to the mark of equanimity, it is possible that his mind will not be properly concentrated for the destruction of the taints. But when from time to time he gives attention to the mark of concentration, from time to time to the mark of exertion, and from time to time to the mark of equanimity, his mind becomes malleable, wieldy, and luminous, not brittle but properly concentrated for the destruction of the taints. Then, there being a suitable basis, he is capable of realizing any state realizable by direct knowledge toward which he might incline his mind.

"If he wishes: 'May I wield the various kinds of psychic potency'... [all as in 3:101, down to:]... If he wishes: 'May I, with the destruction of the taints, in this very life realize for myself with direct knowledge the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, may I dwell in it,' he is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis."

# The Third Fifty

## I. EnlightENMENT

## 103 (1) Before

"Bhikkhus, before my enlightenment, while I was just a bodhisatta, not yet fully enlightened, it occurred to me: (1) 'What is the gratification in the world? (2) What is the danger in it? (3) What is the escape from it? ${ }^{567}$

"Then, bhikkhus, it occurred to me: 'The pleasure and joy that arise in dependence on the world: this is the gratification in the world. That the world is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change: this is the danger in the world. The removal and abandonment of desire and lust for the world. this is the escape from the world.'
"So long, bhikkhus, as I did not directly know as they really are the gratification in the world [259] as gratification, the danger as danger, and the escape from it as escape, I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans. But when I directly knew as it really is the gratification in the world as gratification, the danger as danger, and the escape from it as escape, then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with... its devas and humans.

"The knowledge and vision arose in me: 'Unshakable is my liberation of mind; this is my last birth; now there is no more renewed existence.'"

# 104 (2) Gratification (1) ${ }^{568}$

(1) "Bhikkhus; I set out seeking the gratification in the world. Whatever gratification there is in the world-that I found. I have clearly seen with wisdom just how far the gratification in the world extends.

(2) "I set out seeking the danger in the world. Whatever danger there is in the world-that I found. I have clearly seen with wisdom just how far the danger in the world extends.

(3) "I set out seeking the escape from the world. Whatever escape there is from the world-that I found. I have clearly seen with wisdom just how far the escape from the world extends.

"So long, bhikkhus, as I did not directly know as they really are the gratification in the world as gratification, the danger as danger, and the escape from it as the escape, I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans. But when I directly knew as it really is the gratification in the world as gratification, the danger as danger, and the escape from it as escape, then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with... its devas and humans.

"The knowledge and vision arose in me: 'Unshakable is my liberation of mind; this is my last birth; now there is no more renewed existence.'" [260]

105 (3) Gratification (2)

"Bhikkhus, (1) if there were no gratification in the world, beings would not become enamored of it; but because there is gratification in the world, beings become enamored of it. (2) If there were no danger in the world, beings would not become disenchanted with it; but because there is danger in the world, beings become disenchanted with it. (3) If there were no escape from the world, beings would not escape from it; but because there is an escape from the world, beings escape from it.

"So long, bhikkhus, as beings have not directly known as they really are the gratification in the world as gratification, the danger as danger, and the escape from it as escape, they have not escaped from this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, from this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans; they have not become detached from it, released from it, nor do they dwell with a mind rid of barriers. But when beings have directly known as it really is the gratification in the world as gratification, the danger as danger, and the escape from it as escape, then they have escaped from this world with...its devas and humans; they have become detached from it, released from it, and they dwell with a mind rid of barriers."

106 (4) Ascetics ${ }^{569}$

"Bhikkhus, those ascetics or brahmins who do not understand as it really is (1) the gratification in the world as gratification, (2) the danger as danger, and (3) the escape from it as escape: these I do not consider to be ascetics among ascetics or brahmins among brahmins, and these venerable ones do not, by realizing it for themselves with direct knowledge, in this very life enter and dwell in the goal of asceticism or the goal of brahminhood.

"But those ascetics and brahmins who understand as it really is the gratification in the world as gratification, the danger as danger, and the escape from it as escape: these I consider to be ascetics among ascetics and brahmins among brahmins, and these venerable ones, by realizing it for themselves with direct knowledge, in this very life enter and dwell in the goal of asceticism and the goal of brahminhood." [261]

107 (5) Wailing

"Bhikkhus, (1) in the Noble One's discipline, singing is wailing. (2) In the Noble One's discipline, dancing is madness. (3) In the Noble One's discipline, to laugh excessively, displaying one's teeth, is childishness. Therefore, bhikkhus, in regard to singing and dancing [let there be] the demolition of the bridge. When you smile rejoicing in the Dhamma, you may simply show a smile. ${ }^{\prime \prime 570}$

# 108 (6) No Satiation

"Bhikkhus, there are three things that give no satiation by indulging in them. What three? (1) There is no satiation by indulging in sleep. (2) There is no satiation by indulging in liquor and wine. (3) There is no satiation by indulging in sexual intercourse. These are the three things that give no satiation by indulging in them."

## 109 (7) Peaked Roof (1)

Then the householder Anathapindika approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Householder, when the mind is unprotected, bodily, verbal, and mental actions are unprotected.

"For one whose bodily, verbal, and mental deeds are unprotected, bodily, verbal, and mental actions become tainted. ${ }^{571}$ For one whose bodily, verbal, and mental deeds become tainted, bodily, verbal, and mental actions become rotten. One whose bodily, verbal, and mental deeds become rotten will not have a good death. ${ }^{572}$

"Suppose a house witha peaked roof is badly thatched: then the roof peak, the rafters, and the walls are unprotected; the roof peak, the rafters, and the walls become tainted; the roof peak, the rafters, and the walls become rotten.

"So too, householder, [262] when the mind is unprotected, bodily, verbal, and mental actions are unprotected.... One whose bodily, verbal, and mental deeds are rotten will not have a good death.

"When, householder, the mind is protected, bodily, verbal, and mental actions are pretected.

"For one whose bodily, verbal, and mental deeds are protected, bodily, verbal, and mental actions do not become tainted.

For one whose bodily, verbal, and mental deeds do not become tainted, bodily, verbal, and mental actions do not become rotten. One whose bodily, verbal, and mental deeds do not become rotten will have a good death.

"Suppose a house with a peaked roof is well thatched: then the roof peak, the rafters, and the walls are protected; the roof peak, the rafters, and the walls do not become tainted; the roof peak, the rafters, and the walls do not become rotten.

"So too, householder, when the mind is protected, bodily, verbal, and mental actions are protected. . . . One whose bodily, verbal, and mental deeds do not become rotten will have a good death."

# 110 (8) Peaked Roof (2)

The Blessed One then said to the householder Anāthapindika:

"Householder, when the mind has failed, bodily, verbal, and mental actions fail: One whose bodily, verbal, and mental deeds fail will not have a good death.

"Suppose a house with a peaked roof is badly thatched: then the roof peak, the rafters, and the walls fail. So too, when the mind has failed, bodily, verbal, and mental actions fail. One whose bodily, verbal, and mental deeds have failed will not have a good death.

"Householder, when the mind has not failed, bodily, verbal, and mental actions do not fail. One whose deeds of body, speech, and mind do not fail will have a good death.

"Suppose a house with a peaked roof is well thatched: then the roof peak, [263] the rafters, and the walls do not fail. So too, when the mind has not failed, bodily, verbal, and mental actions do not fail. One whose deeds of body, speech, and mind do not fail will have a good death."

## 111 (9) Causes (1)

"Bhikkhus, there are these three causes for the origination of kamma. What three? Greed is a cause for the origination of kamma; hatred is a cause for the origination of kamma; delusion is a cause for the origination of kamma.

(1) "Any kamma fashioned by greed, born of greed, caused by greed, originating from greed, is unwholesome and blameworthy and results in suffering. That kamma leads to the origination of kamma, not to the cessation of kamma. ${ }^{573}$
(2) "Any kamma fashioned by hatred... (3) Any kamma fashioned by delusion, born of delusion, caused by delusion, originating from delusion, is unwholesome and blameworthy and results in suffering. That kamma leads to the origination of kamma, not to the cessation of kamma.

"These are the three causes for the origination of kamma. ${ }^{574}$

"There are, bhikkhus, these three [other] causes for the origination of kamma. ${ }^{575}$ What three? Non-greed is a cause for the origination of kamma; non-hatred is a cause for the origination of kamma; non-delusion is a cause for the origination of kamma.

(1) "Any kamma fashioned by non-greed, born of non-greed, caused by non-greed, originating from non-greed, is wholesome and blameless and results in happiness. That kamma leads to the cessation of kamma, not to the origination of kamma.

(2) "Any kamma fashioned by non-hatred... (3) Any kamma fashioned by non-delusion, born of non-delusion, caused by non-delusion, originating from non-delusion, is wholesome and blameless and results in happiness. That kamma leads to the cessation of kamma, not to the origination of kamma.

"These are the three [other] causes for the origination of kamma." [264]

# 112 (10) Causes (2)

Bhikkhus, there are these three causes for the origination of kamma. What three? (1) Desire arises with reference to things in the past that are the basis for desire and lust. (2) Desire arises with reference to things in the future that are the basis for desire and lust. (3) Desire arises with reference to things presently existing that are the basis for desire and lust.

(1) "And how, bhikkhus, does desire arise with reference to things in the past that are the basis for desire and lust? One thinks about and mentally examines things in the past that are the basis for desire and lust. As one does so, desire arises. When desire springs up, one is fettered by those things. The mental infatuation is what I call the fetter. It is in this way that desire arises with reference to things in the past that are the basis for desire and lust.

(2) "And how does desire arise with reference to things in the future that are the basis for desire and lust? One thinks
about and mentally examines things in the future that are the basis for desire and lust. As one does so, desire arises. When desire springs up, one is fettered by those things. The mental infatuation is what I call the fetter. It is in this way that desire arises with reference to things in the future that are the basis for desire and lust.

(3) "And how does desire arise with reference to things presently existing that are the basis for desire and lust? One thinks about and mentally examines things presently existing that are the basis for desire and lust. As one does so, desire arises. When desire springs up, one is fettered by those things. The mental infatuation is what I call the fetter. It is in this way that desire arises with reference to things presently existing that are the basis for desire and lust.

"These are the three causes for the origination of kamma. ${ }^{576}$ [265]

"There are, bhikkhus, these three [other] causes for the origination of kamma. What three? Desire does not arise with reference to things in the past that are the basis for desire and lust. Desire does not arise with reference to things in the future that are the basis for desire and lust. Desire does not arise with reference to things presently existing that are the basis for desire and lust.

(1) "And how, bhikkhus, does desire not arise with reference to things in the past that are the basis for desire and lust? One understands the future result of things in the past that are the basis for desire and lust. Having understood the future result, one avoids it. ${ }^{577}$ Having avoided it, one becomes dispassionate in mind, and having pierced through with wisdom, one sees. ${ }^{578}$ It is in this way that desire does not arise with reference to things in the past that are the basis for desire and lust.

(2) "And how, bhikkhus, does desire not arise with reference to things in the future that are the basis for desire and lust? One understands the future result of things in the future that are the basis for desire and lust. Having understood the future result, one avoids it. Having avoided it, one becomes dispassionate in mind and, having pierced through with wisdom, one sees. It is in this way that desire does not arise with reference to things in the future that are the basis for desire and lust.

(3) "And how, bhikkhus, does desire not arise with reference
to things presently existing that are the basis for desire and lust? One understands the future result of things presently existing that are the basis for desire and lust. Having understood the future result, one avoids it. Having avoided it, one becomes dispassionate in mind and, having pierced through with wisdom, one sees. It is in this way that desire does not arise with reference to things presently existing that are the basis for desire and lust.

"These are the three [other] causes for the origination of kamma."

# II. Bound for the Plane of Misery

113 (1) Bound for the Plane of Misery

"Bhikkhus, there are three who, if they do not abandon this [fault of theirs], are bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell. Which three? [266] (1) One who, though not celibate, claims to be celibate; (2) one who slanders a pure celibate leading a pure celibate life with a groundless charge of non-celibacy; and (3) one who holds such a doctrine and view as this: 'There is no fault in sensual pleasures,' and then falls into indulgence in sensual pleasures. ${ }^{579}$ These are the three who, if they do not abandon this [fault of theirs], are bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell."

## 114 (2) Rare

"Bhikkhus, the manifestation of three [persons] is rare in the world. What three? (1) The manifestation of a Tathāgata, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One is rare in the world. (2) A person who teaches the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata is rare in the world. (3) A grateful and thankful person is rare in the world. The manifestation of these three [persons] is rare in the world."

## 115 (3) Immeasurable

"Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world. What three? The one who is easily measured, the one who is hard to measure, and the immeasurable one.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the person who is easily measured? Here, some person is restless, puffed up, personally
vain, talkative, rambling in his talk, muddle-minded, without clear comprehension, unconcentrated, with a wandering mind, with loose sense faculties. This is called the person who is easily measured.

(2) "And what is the person who is hard to measure? Here, some person is not restless, puffed up, and personally vain; he is not talkative and rambling in his talk; he has mindfulness established and clearly comprehends, is concentrated, with a one-pointed mind, with restrained sense faculties. This is called the person who is hard to measure.

(3) "And what is the person who is immeasurable? Here, a bhikkhu is an arahant, one whose taints have been destroyed. This is called the person who is immeasurable.

"These are the three kinds of persons found existing in the world" [267]

# 116 (4) Imperturbable

"Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world. What three?

(1) "Here, bhikkhus, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, [perceiving] 'space is infinite,' some person enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of space. He relishes it, desires it, and finds satisfaction in it. If he is firm in it, focused on it, often dwells in it, and has not lost it when he dies, he is reborn in companionship with the devas of the base of the infinity of space. The life span of the devas of the base of the infinity of space is 20,000 eons. The worldling remains there all his life, and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas, he goes to hell, to the animai realm, or to the sphere of afflicted spirits. ${ }^{580}$ But the Blessed One's disciple remains there all his life, and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas, he attains final nibbāna in that very same state of existence. This is the distinction, the disparity, the difference between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling, that is, when there is future destination and rebirth. ${ }^{581}$

(2) "Again, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of space, [perceiving] 'consciousness is infinite,' someone here enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of consciousness.

He relishes it, desires it, and finds satisfaction in it. If he is firm in it, focused on it, often dwells in it, and has not lost it when he dies, he is reborn in companionship with the devas of the base of the infinity of consciousness. The life span of the devas of the base of the infinity of consciousness is 40,000 eons. The worldling remains there all his life, and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas, he goes to hell, to the animal realm, or to the sphere of afflicted spirits. But the Blessed One's disciple remains there all his life, and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas, he attains final nibbāna in that very same state of existence. This is the distinction, the disparity, the difference [268] between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling, that is, when there is future destination and rebirth.

(3) "Again, bhikkhus, by completely surmounting the base of the infinity of consciousness [perceiving] 'there is nothing,' some person here enters and dwells in the base of nothingness. He relishes it, desires it, and finds satisfaction in it. If he is firm in it, focused on it, often dwells in it, and has not lost it when he dies, he is reborn in companionship with the devas of the base of nothingness. The life span of the devas of the base of nothingness is 60,000 eons. The worldling remains there all his life, and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas, he goes to hell, to the animal realm, or to the sphere of afflicted spirits. But the Blessed One's disciple remains there all his life, and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas, he attains final nibbāna in that very same state of existence. This is the distinction, the disparity, the difference between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling, that is, when there is future destination and rebirth.

"These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons found existing in the world."

# 117 (5) Failures and Accomplishments

"Bhikkhus, there are these three failures. What three? Failure in virtuous behavior, failure in mind, and failure in view.

(1) "And what is failure in virtuous behavior? Here, someone destroys life, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, speaks falsehood, speaks divisively, speaks harshly, and indulges in idle chatter. This is called failure in virtuous behavior.
(2) "And what is failure in mind? Here, someone is full oflonging and has a mind of ill will. This is called failure in mind.

(3) "And what is failure in view? Here, someone holds wrong view and has an incorrect perspective thus: 'There is nothing given, nothing sacrificed, nothing offered; there is no [269] fruit or result of good and bad actions; there is no this world, no other world; there is no mother, no father; there are no beings spontaneously reborn; there are in the world no ascetics and brahmins of right conduct and right practice who, having realized this world and the other world for themselves by direct knowledge, make them known to others.

"Bhikkhus, there are these three purities. What three? Bodily purily, verbal purity, and mental purity:

(1) "And what is bodily purity? Here, someone abstains from
the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, and from sexual misconduct. This is called bodily purity.

(2) "And what is verbal purity? Here, someone abstains from false speech, from divisive speech, from harsh speech, and from idle chatter. This is called verbal purity.

(3) "And what is mental purity? Here, someone is without longing, without ill will, [272] and holds right view. This is called mental purity.

"These, bhikkhus, are the three purities."

121 (9) Purity (2)

"Bhikkhus, there are these three purities. What three? Bodily purity, verbal purity, and mental purity.

(1) "And what is bodily purity? Here, a bhikkhu abstains from the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, and from sexual activity. This is called bodily purity.

(2) "And what is verbal purity? Here, a bhikkhu abstains from false speech, from divisive speech, from harsh speech, and from idle chatter. This is called verbal purity.

(3) "And what is mental purity? ${ }^{583}$ Here, when there is sensual desire in him, a bhikkhu understands: 'There is sensual desire in $\mathrm{me}^{\prime}$; or when there is no sensual desire in him, he understands: 'There is no sensual desire in me'; and he also understands how unarisen sensual desire arises, how arisen sensual desire is abandoned, and how abandoned sensual desire does not arise again in the future.

"When there is ill will in him... When there is dullness and drowsiness in him... When there is restlessness and remorse in him... [273]... When there is doubt in him, he understands: 'There is doubt in me'; or when there is no doubt in him, he understands: 'There is no doubt in me'; and he also understands how unarisen doubt arises, how, arisen doubt is abandoned, and how abandoned doubt does not arise again in the future. This is called mental purity.

"These, bhikkhus, are the three purities."

Pure in body, pure in speech, pure in mind, without taints:

they call the pure one, accomplished in purity,

"one who has washed away evil."

# 122 (10) Sagacity

"Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of sagacity. What three? Bodily sagacity, verbal sagacity, and mental sagacity.

(1) "And what is bodily sagacity? Here, someone abstains from the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, and from sexual activity. This is called bodily sagacity.

(2) "And what is verbal sagacity? Here, someone abstains from false speech, from divisive speech, from harsh speech, and from idle chatter. This is called verbal sagacity.

(3) "And what is mental sagacity? Here, with the destruction of the taints, a bhikkhu has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. This is called mental sagacity.

"These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of sagacity."

A sage by body, a sage in speech, a sage in mind, without taints:

they call the sage, accomplished in sagacity, "one who has abandoned all." [274]

## III. BHARANDU ${ }^{584}$

## 123 (1) Kusinārā

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kusinārā, in the Baliharaña forest thicket. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus...

"Here, bhikkhus, a bhik:khu dwells in dependence on a certain village or town. A householder or a householder's son approaches him and invites him for the next day's meal. If he wishes, the bhikkhu accepts. When the night has passed, in the morning the bhikkhu dresses, takes his bowl and robe, and goes to the residence of that householder or householder's son. He sits down in the seat that has been prepared and that householder or householder's son, with his own hand, serves and satisfies him with various kinds of delicious food. (1) It occurs to him: 'How good, indeed, that this householder or householder's son, with his own hand, serves and satisfies me with various kinds of delicious food!' (2) It also occurs to him: 'Oh, in the future too may this householder or householder's son, with his own
hand, serve and satisfy me with a similar variety of delicious food!' (3) He uses that food while being tied to it, infatuated with it, blindly absorbed in it, not seeing the danger in it and understanding the escape from it. He thinks sensual thoughts in relation to it; he thinks thoughts of ill will; he thinks thoughts of harming. What is given to such a bhikkhu, I say, is not of great fruit. For what reason? Because the bhikkhu is heedless.

"Here, a bhikkhu dwells in dependence on a certain village or town. A householder or a householder's son approaches him and invites him for the next day's meal. If he wishes, the bhikkhu accepts. When the night has passed, in the morning the bhikkhu dresses, takes his bowl and robe, and goes to the residence of that householder or householder's son. He sits down in the seat that has been prepared and that householder or householder's son, with his own hand, serves and satisfies him with various kinds of delicious food. (1) It does not occur to him: 'How good, indeed, that this householder [275] or householder's son, with his own hand, serves and satisfies me with various kinds of delicious food!' (2) It also does not occur to him: 'Oh, in the future too may this householder or householder's son, with his own hand, serve and satisfy me with a similar variety of delicious food!' (3) He uses that food without being tied to it, infatuated with it, and blindly absorbed in it, but seeing the danger in it and understanding the escape from it. He thinks thoughts of renunciation in relation to it; he thinks thoughts of good will; he thinks thoughts of non-harming. What is given to such a bhikkhu, I say, is of great fruit. For what reason? Because the bhikkhu is heedful."

# 124 (2) Arguments

"Bhikkhus, wherever bhikkhus take to arguing and quarreling and fall into a dispute, stabbing each other with piercing words, I am uneasy even about directing my attention there, let alone about going there. I conclude about them: 'Surely, those venerable ones have abandoned three things and cultivated three [other] things.'

"What are the three things they have abandoned? Thoughts of renunciation, thoughts of good will, and thoughts of nonharming. These are the three things they have abandoned.

"What are the three things they have cultivated? Sensual
thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of harming. These are the three things they have cultivated.

"Wherever bhikkhus take to arguing and quarreling and fall into a dispute . . I conclude: 'Surely, those venerable ones have abandoned these three things and cultivated these three [other] things.'

"Bhikkhus, wherever bhikkhus are dwelling in concord, harmoniously, without disputes, blending like milk and water, viewing each other with eyes of affection, I am at ease about going there, let alone about directing my attention there. I conclude: 'Surely, those venerable ones have abandoned three things and cultivated three [other] things.'

"What are the three things they have abandoned? [276] Sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of harming. These are the three things they have abandoned.

"What are the three things they have cultivated? Thoughts of renunciation, thoughts of good will, and thoughts of nonharming. These are the three things they have cultivated.

"Wherever bhikkhus are dwelling in concord ... I conclude: 'Surely, those venerable ones have abandoned these three things and cultivated these three [other] things.'"

# 125 (3) Gotamaka

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesāli at the Gotamaka Shrine. ${ }^{585}$ There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus...

"Bhikkhus, (1) I teach the Dhamma through direct knowledge, not without direct knowledge. (2) I teach the Dhamma with a basis, not without a basis. (3) I teach the Dhamma that is antidotal, not one without antidotes. ${ }^{586}$ Since I teach the Dhamma through direct knowledge, not without direct knowledge; since I teach the Dhamma with a basis, not without a basis; since I teach the Dhamma that is antidotal, not one without antidotes, my exhortation should be acted upon, my instructions should be acted upon. It is enough for you to rejoice, enough for you to be elated, enough for you to be joyful: 'The Blessed One is perfectly enlightened! The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One! The Sangha is practicing the good path!'"

This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed One's statement. And while this
discourse was being spoken, the thousandfold world system shook.

# 126 (4) Bharandu

On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans when he reached Kapilavatthu. Mahānāma the Sakyan heard: "The Blessed One has arrived at Kapilavatthu." Then Mahānāma the Sakyan approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Go, Mahānāma, and find a suitable rest house in Kapilavatthu where we might stay for the night." [277]

"Yes, Bhante," Mahānāma replied. He then entered Kapilavatthu and searched the entire city but did not see a suitable rest house where the Blessed One could stay for the night. So he returned to the Blessed One and told him: "Bhante, there is no suitable rest house in Kapilavatthu where the Blessed One might stay for the night. But Bharandu the Kālāma, formerly the Blessed One's fellow monk, [is here]. ${ }^{587}$ Let the Blessed One spend the night at his hermitage."

"Go, Mahānāma, and prepare a mat for me."

"Yes, Bhante," Mahānāma replied. Then he went to Bharandu's hermitage, prepared a mat, set out water for washing the feet, returned to the Blessed One, and said:

"I have spread a mat, Bhante, and set out water for washing the feet. The Blessed One may go at his own convenience."

Then the Blessed One went to Bharandu's hermitage, sat down on the seat that was prepared for him, and washed his feet. It then occurred to Mahānāma: "This is not a proper time for staying with the Blessed One, for he is tired. I will visit him tomorrow." Then he paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed.

Then, when the night had passed, Mahānāma approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"There are, Mahānāma, these three kinds of teachers found existing in the world. What three?

(1) "Here, Mahānāma, some teacher prescribes the full understanding of sensual pleasures, but not of forms or feelings. (2) Another teacher prescribes the full understanding of sensual
pleasures and forms, but not [278] of feelings. (3) Still another teacher prescribes the full understanding of sensual pleasures, forms, and feelings. These are the three kinds of teachers found existing in the world. Is the goal of these three kinds of teachers the same or different?"

When this was said, Bharandu the Kālāma said to Mahānāma: "Say the same, Mahānāma." But the Blessed One said to Mahānāma: "Say different, Mahānāma."

A second time... A third time Bharandu the Kālāma said to Mahānāma: "Say the same, Mahānāma." But the Blessed One said to Mahānāma: "Say different, Mahānāma."

Then it occurred to Bharandu: "The ascetic Gotama has contradicted me three times in front of the influential Mahānāma the Sakyan. I had better leave Kapilavatthu."

Then Bharandu the Kālāma left Kapilavatthu. When he left Kapilavatthu, he left for good and never returned.

# 127 (5) Hatthaka

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Then, when the night had advanced, the young deva Hatthaka, ${ }^{588}$ illuminating the entire Jeta's Grove, approached the Blessed One. I laving approached, [while thinking:] "I will stand in front of the Blessed One," he sank down, descended, and could not remain in place. Just as ghee or oil, when poured on sand, sinks down, descends, and does not remain in place, so the young deva Hatthaka, [while thinking:] "I will stand in front of the Blessed One," sank down, descended, and could not remain in place. [279].

Then the Blessed One said to Hatthaka: "Create a gross body, Hatthaka."

"Yes, Bhante," Hatthaka replied. Then he created a gross body, paid homage to the Blessed One, and stood to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Hatthaka, do those teachings that you could recall in the past, when you were a human being, come back to you now?"589

"Bhante, those teachings that I could recall in the past, when I was a human being, come back to me now; and those teachings that I could not recall in the past, when I was a human being, come back to me now. ${ }^{590}$ Just as the Blessed One is now hemmed in by bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, male and female lay followers, kings
and royal ministers, sectarian teachers and their disciples, so I am hemmed in by other young devas. Young devas come to me even from a distance, [thinking]: 'We will hear the Dhamma from the young deva Hatthaka.'

"I died, Bhante, insatiable and unquenchable in three things. What three? (1) I died insatiable and unquenchable in seeing the Blessed One. (2) I died insatiable and unquenchable in hearing the good Dhamma. (3) I died insatiable and unquenchable in attending upon the Sangha. I died insatiable and unquenchable in these three things.

"I could never get enough of seeing the Blessed One, hearing the good Dhamma, and attending on the Sangha.

"Training in the higher virtuous behavior, I rejoiced in hearing the good Dhamma. Hatthaka has gone to [rebirth in] Aviha ${ }^{591}$ not having gotten enough of these three things."

# 128 (6) Pollution

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling in Bārānasī at the deer park in Isipatana. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Bārānasī for alms. [280] While walking for alms near the cattle-yoking fig tree, ${ }^{592}$ the Blessed One saw a dissatisfied bhikkhu, [seeking] gratification outwardly, ${ }^{593}$ muddle-minded, without clear comprehension, unconcentrated, with a wandering mind and loose sense faculties. Having seen him, he said to that bhikkhu:

"Bhikkhu, bhikkhu! Do not pollute yourself. ${ }^{594}$ It is inevitable, bhikkhu, that flies will pursue and attack one who has polluted himself and been tainted by a stench." ${ }^{\prime 595}$

Then, being exhorted thus by the Blessed One, that bhikkhu acquired a sense of urgency. ${ }^{595}$

When the Blessed One had walked for alms in Bārānasī, after his meal, when he had returned from his alms round, he addressed the bhikkhus:

"Bhikkhus, this morning I dressed, took my bowl and robe, and entered Bārānasī for alms. While walking for alms near
the cattle-yoking fig tree, I saw a dissatisfied bhikkhu [seeking] gratification outwardly, muddle-minded, without clear comprehension, unconcentrated, with a wandering mind and loose sense faculties. Having seen him, I said to that bhikkhu: 'Bhikkhu, bhikkhu! Do not pollute yourself. It is inevitable, bhikkhu, that flies will pursue and attack one who has polluted himself and been tainted by a stench.' Then, being exhorted thus by me, that bhikkhu acquired a sense of urgency."

When this was said, a certain bhikkhu asked the Blessed One: "What, Bhante, is meant by 'pollution'? What is the 'stench'? And what are the 'flies'?"

(1) "Longing, bhikkhu, is what is meant by 'pollution.' (2) Ill will is the 'stench.' (3) Bad unwholesome thoughts are the 'flies.' It is inevitable that flies will pursue and attack one who has polluted himself and been tainted by a stench." [281]

The flies-thoughts based on lustwill run in pursuit of one unrestrained in the sense faculties, unguarded in the eye and ear.

A bhikkhu who is polluted, tainted by a stench, is far from nibbāna and reaps only distress.

Whether in the village or the forest, the unwise foolish person, not having gained peace for himself, goes around followed by flies. ${ }^{597}$

But those accomplished in virtuous behavior who delight in wisdom and peace, those peaceful ones live happily, having destroyed the flies. ${ }^{598}$

# 129 (7) Anuruddha (1)

Then the Venerable Anuruddha approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: "Now, Bhante, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses
the human, I see that women, with the breakup of the body, after death, are mostly reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. What qualities does a woman possess on account of which, with the breakup of the body, after death, she is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell?"

"When she possesses three qualities, Anuruddha, with the breakup of the body, after death, a woman is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. What three?

(1) "Here, Anuruddha, in the morning a woman dwells at home with a mind obsessed by the stain of miserliness. (2) At midday she dwells at home with a mind obsessed by envy. (3) And in the evening she dwells at home with a mind obsessed by sensual lust. When she possesses these three qualities, with the breakup of the body, after death, a woman is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell."

# 130 (8) Anuruddha (2)

Then the Venerable Anuruddha approached the Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, [282] he sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Sāriputta:

"Here, friend Sāriputta, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, I survey a thousandfold world system. Energy is aroused in me without slackening; my mindfulness is established without confusion; my body is tranquil without disturbance; my mind is concentrated and one-pointed. Yet my mind is still toot liberated from the taints through nonclinging."

[The Venerable Sāriputta said:] (1) "Friend Anuruddha, when you think: 'With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, I survey a thousandfold world system,' this is your conceit.

(2) "And when you think: 'Energy is aroused in me without slackening; my mindfulness is established without confusion; my body is tranquil without disturbance; my mind is concentrated and one-pointed,' this is your restlessness.

(3) "And when you think: Yet my mind is still not liberated from the taints through non-clinging,' this is your remorse.
"It would be good if you would abandon these three qualities and stop attending to them. Instead, direct your mind to the deathless element."

Some time later the Venerable Anuruddha abandoned those three qualities and stopped attending to them. Instead, he directed his mind to the deathless element. Then, dwelling alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute, in no long time the Venerable Anuruddha realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having entered upon it, he dwelled in it. He directly knew: "Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being." And the Venerable Anuruddha became one of the arahants.

# 131 (9) Concealed

"Bhikkhus, there are these three things that flourish when concealed, not when exposed. What three? (1) Women flourish when concealed, not when exposed. ${ }^{599}$ (2) The hymns of the brahmins flourish when concealed, not [283] when exposed. (3) And wrong views flourish when concealed, not when exposed. These are the three things that flourish when concealed, not when exposed.

"Bhikkhus, there are these three things that shine when exposed, not when concealed. What three? (1) The moon shines when exposed, not when concealed. (2) The sun shines when exposed, not when concealed. (3) The Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata shines when exposed, not when concealed. These are the three things that shine when exposed, not when concealed."

## 132 (10) Line Etched in Stone

"Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world. What three? The person who is like a line etched in stone, the person who is like a line etched in the ground, and the person who is like a line etched in water.

(1) "And what kind of person is like a line etched in stone? Here, some person often gets angry, and his anger persists for a long time. Just as a line etched in stone is not quickly erased
by the wind and water but persists for a long time, so too, some person often gets angry, and his anger persists for a long time. This is called the person who is like a line etched in stone.

(2) "And what kind of person is like a line etched in the ground? Here, some person often gets angry, but his anger does not persist for a long time. Just as a line etched in the ground is quickly erased by the wind and water and does not persist for a long time, so too, some person often gets angry, but his anger does not persist for a long time. This is called the person who is like a line etched in the ground.

(3) "And what kind of person is like a line etched in water? Here, some person, even when spoken to roughly [284] and harshly, in disagreeable ways, remains on friendly terms [with his antagonist], mingles [with him], and greets [him]. Just as a line etched in water quickly disappears and does not persist for a long time, so too, some person, even when spoken to roughly and harshly, in disagreeable ways, remains on friendly terms [with his antagonist], mingles [with him], and greets [him]. This is called the person who is like a line etched in water.

"These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons found existing in the world."

# IV. A WARRIOR

## 133 (1) A Warrior

"Bhikkhus, possessing three factors, a warrior is worthy of a king, an accessory of a king, and reckoned a factor of kingship. What three? Here, a warrior is a long-distance shooter, a sharp-shooter, and one who splits a great body. Possessing these three factors, a warrior is worthy of a king, an accessory of a king, and reckoned a factor of kingship. So too, possessing three factors, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What three? Here, a bhikkhu is a long-distance shooter, a sharp-shooter, and one who splits a great body.

(1) "And how is a bhikkhu a long-distance shooter? Here, any kind of form whatsoever-whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near-a bhikkhu sees all form as it really is with correct
wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' Any kind of feeling whatsoever... [285]... Any kind of perception whatsoever... Any kind of volitional activities whatsoever... Any kind of consciousness whatsoever-whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near-a bhikkhu sees all consciousness as it really is with correct wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' It is in this way that a bhikkhu is a long-distance shooter.

(2) "And how is a bhikkhu a sharp-shooter? Here, a bhikkhu understands as it really is: 'This is suffering.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the origin of suffering.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the cessation of suffering.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' It is in this way that a bhikkhu is a sharp-shooter.

(3) "And how is a bhikkhu one who splits a great body? Here, a bhikkhu splits the great mass of ignorance. It is in this way that a bhikkhu is one who splits a great body.

"Possessing these three qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

# 134 (2) Assemblies

"Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of assemblies. What three? The assembly trained in vain talk, the assembly trained in interrogation, and the assembly trained to the limits. These are the three kinds of assemblies. ${ }^{\prime 600}$ [286]

## 135 (3) A Friend

"Bhikkhus, one should associate with a friend who possesses three factors. What three? (1) Here, a bhikkhu gives what is hard to give. (2) He does what is hard to do. (3) He patiently endures what is hard to endure. One should associate with a friend who possesses these three factors."

## 136 (4) Arising

(1) "Bhikkhus, whether Tathāgatas arise or not, there persists that law, that stableness of the Dhamma, that fixed course of the Dhamma: ${ }^{601}$ 'All conditioned phenomena are impermanent.' A Tathāgata awakens to this and breaks through to it, and then
he explains it, teaches it, proclaims it, establishes it, discloses it, analyzes it, and elucidates it thus: 'All conditioned phenomena are impermanent. ${ }^{\prime 602}$

(2) "Bhikkhus, whether Tathāgatas arise or not, there persists that law, that stableness of the Dhamma, that fixed course of the Dhamma: 'All conditioned phenomena are suffering.'

(3) "Bhikkhus, whether Tathāgatas arise or not, there persists that law, that stableness of the Dhamma, that fixed course of the Dhamma: 'All phenomena are non-self.' A Tathāgata awakens to this and breaks through to it, and then he explains it, teaches it, proclaims it, establishes it, discloses it, analyzes it, and elucidates it thus: 'All phenomena are non-self.'"

# 137 (5) A Hair Blanket

"Bhikkhus, a hair blanket is declared to be the worst kind of woven garment. ${ }^{603}$ A hair blanket is cold in cold weather, hot in hot weather, ugly, foul-smelling, and uncomfortable. So too, the doctrine of Makkhali is declared the worst among the doctrines of the various ascetics. ${ }^{604}$ The hollow man Makkhali teaches the doctrine and view: 'There is no kamma, no deed, no energy.' [287]

(1) "Bhikkhus, the Blessed Ones, Arahants, Perfectly Enlightened Ones of the past taught a doctrine of kamma, a doctrine of deeds, a doctrine of energy. Yet the hollow man Makkhali contradicts them [with his claim]: 'There is no kamma, no deed, no energy.'

(2) "The Blessed Ones, Arahants, Perfectly Enlightened Ones of the future will also teach a doctrine of kamma, a doctrine of deeds, a doctrine of energy. Yet the hollow man Makkhali contradicts them [with his claim]: 'There is no kamma, no deed, no energy.'

(3) "At present I am the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, and I teach a doctrine of kamma, a doctrine of deeds, a doctrine of energy. Yet the hollow man Makkhali contradicts me [with his claim]: 'There is no kamma, no deed, no energy.'

"Just as a trap set at the mouth of a river would bring about harm, suffering, calamity, and disaster to many fish, so too,
the hollow man Makkhali is, as it were, a 'trap for people' who has arisen in the world for the harm, suffering, calamity, and disaster of many beings."

# 138 (6) Accomplishment

"Bhikkhus, there are these three accomplishments. What three? Accomplishment of faith, accomplishment of virtuous behavior, and accomplishment of wisdom. These are the three accomplishments."

## 139 (7) Growth ${ }^{\text {os }}$

"Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of growth. What three? Growth in faith, growth in virtuous behavior, and growth in wisdom. These are the three kinds of growth."

140 (8) Horses (1)

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you the three kinds of wild colts and the three kinds of persons who are like wild colts. Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"And what, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of wild colts? [288] (1) Here, one kind of wild colt possesses speed but not beauty or the right proportions. (2) Another kind of wild colt possesses speed and beauty but not the right proportions. (3) And still another kind of wild colt possesses speed, beauty, and the right proportions. These are the three kinds of wild colts.

"And what, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons who are like wild colts? (1) Here, one kind of person who is like a wild colt possesses speed but not beauty or the right proportions. (2) Another kind of person who is like a wild colt possesses speed and beauty but not the right proportions. (3) And still another kind of person who is like a wild colt possesses speed, beauty, and the right proportions.

(1) "And how does a person who is like a wild colt possess speed but not beauty or the right proportions? Here, a bhikkhu understands as it really is: 'This is suffering,' and 'This is the origin of suffering,' and 'This is the cessation of suffering,' and 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' This, I say, is his speed. But when asked a question pertaining to the Dhamma or the discipline, he falters and does not answer.

This, I say, is his lack of beauty. And he does not gain robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick. This, I say, is his lack of the right proportions. In this way a person who is like a wild colt possesses speed but not beauty or the right proportions.

(2) "And how does a person who is like a wild colt possess speed and beauty but not the right proportions? Here, a bhikkhu understands as it really is: 'This is suffering'... 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' This, I say, is his speed. And when asked a question pertaining to the Dhamma or the discipline, he answers and does not falter. This, I say, is his beauty. But he does not gain robes... and provisions for the sick. This, I say, is his lack of the right proportions. In this way [289] a person who is like a wild colt possesses speed and beauty but not the right proportions.

(3) "And how does a person who is like a wild colt possess speed, beauty, and the right proportions? Here, a bhikkhu understands as it really is: 'This is suffering,' and 'This is the origin of suffering,' and 'This is the cessation of suffering,' and 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' This, I say, is his speed. And when asked a question pertaining to the Dhamma or the discipline, he answers and does not falter. This, I say, is his beauty. And he gains robes . . . and provisions for the sick. This, I say, is his right proportions. In this way a person who is like a wild colt possesses speed, beauty, and the right proportions.

"These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons who are like wild colts."

141 (9) Horses (2) "?

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you the three kinds of good horses and the three kinds of persons who are like good horses. ${ }^{605}$ Listen...

"And what, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of good horses? (1) Here, one kind of good horse possesses speed but not beauty or the right proportions.

These are the three kinds of good horses.

"And what, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons who are
like good horses? (1) Here, one kind of person who is like a good horse possesses speed but not beauty or the right proportions.

Here, with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, a bhikkhu becomes one of spontaneous birth, due to attain final nibbāna there without ever returning from that world. This, I say, is his speed. But when asked a question pertaining to the Dhamma or the discipline, he falters and does not answer. This, I say, is his lack of beauty. And he does not gain robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick. This, I say, is his lack of the right proportions. In this way a person who is like a good horse possesses speed but not beauty or the right proportions.

# VI. WAYS OF PRACTICE ${ }^{609}$

156 (1) [Establishments of Mindfulness] ${ }^{610}$

"Bhikkhus, there are these three ways of practice. What three? The coarse way of practice, the blistering way of practice, and the middle way of practice. ${ }^{611}$

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the coarse way of practice? Here, someone holds such a doctrine and view as this: 'There is no fault in sensual pleasures,' and then indulges in sensual pleasures. This is called the coarse way of practice.

(2) "And what is the blistering way of practice? ${ }^{612}$ Here, someone goes naked, rejecting conventions, licking his hands, not coming when asked, not stopping when asked; he does not accept food brought or food specially made or an invitation to a meal; he receives nothing from a pot, from a bowl, across a threshold, across a stick, across a pestle, from two eating together, from a pregnant woman, from a woman nursing a child, from a woman being kept by a man, from where food is advertised to be distributed, from where a dog is waiting, from where flies are buzzing; he accepts no fish or meat; he drinks no liquor, wine, or fermented brew.

"He keeps to one house [on alṃs round], to one morsel of food; he keeps to two houses, to two morsels... he keeps to seven houses, to seven morsels. He lives on one saucer a day, on two saucers a day... on seven saucers a day. He takes food once a day, once every two days . . . once every seven days; thus even up to once every fortnight, he dwells pursuing the practice of taking food at stated intervals.

"He is an eater of greens or millet or forest rice or hide-parings or moss or rice bran or rice scum or sesame flour or grass or
cow dung. He subsists on forest roots and fruits; he feeds on fallen fruits.

"He wears hemp robes, robes of hemp-mixed cloth, shroud robes, rag-robes; robes made from tree bark, antelope hides, strips of antelope hide; robes of kusa grass, bark fabric, or woodshavings fabric; a mantle made of head hair [296] or of animal wool; a covering made of owls' wings.

"He is one who pulls out hair and beard, pursuing the practice of pulling out hair and beard. He is one who stands continuously, rejecting seats. He is one who squats continuously, devoted to maintaining the squatting position. He is one who uses a mattress of thorns; he makes a mattress of thorns his bed. He dwells pursuing the practice of bathing in water three times daily including the evening. Thus in such a variety of ways he dwells pursuing the practice of tormenting and mortifying the body. This is called the blistering way of practice.

(3) "And what is the middle way of practice? Here, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed longing and dejection in regard to the world. He dwells contemplating feelings in feelings . . . mind in mind . . . phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed longing and dejection in regard to the world. This is called the middle way of practice.

"These, bhikkhus, are the three ways of practice."

(157) "Bhikkhus, there are these three ways of practice. What three? The coarse way of practice, the blistering way of practice, and the middle way of practice.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the coarse way of practice? . . [as in 3:156]... This is called the coarse way of practice.

(2) "And what is the blistering way of practice?... [as in 3:156]... This is called the blistering way of practice.

(3) "And what is the middle way of practice? Here, a bhikkhu generates desire for the non-arising of unarisen bad unwholesome states; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. He generates desire for the abandoning of arisen bad unwholesome states... for the arising of unarisen wholesome states... for the maintenance of arisen wholesome
states, for their non-decline, increase, expansion, and fulfillment by development; [297] he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. . ."

(158) "... he develops the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to desire and activities of striving. He develops the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to energy and activities of striving ... that possesses concentration due to mind and activities of striving...that possesses concentration due to investigation and activities of striving. . ."

(159) "... he develops the faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, the faculty of wisdom:..."

(160) "... he develops the power of faith, the power of energy, the power of mindfulness, the power of concentration, the power of wisdom. . ."

(162) "... he develops right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration. This is called the middle way of practice.

# The Book of the Fours

## Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One

## The First Fifty

## I. BHANDAGAMA

## 1 (1) Understood

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Vajjis at Bhandagama. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this: ${ }^{618}$ "Bhikkhus, it is because of not understanding and penetrating four things that you and I have roamed and wandered for such a long stretch of time. ${ }^{619}$ What four?

"It is, bhikkhus, because of not understanding and penetrating noble virtuous behavior, noble concentration, noble wisdom, and noble liberation that you and I have roamed and wandered for such a long stretch of time.

"Noble virtuous behavior has been understood and penetrated. Noble concentration has been understood and penetrated. Noble wisdom has been understood and penetrated. Noble liberation has been understood and penetrated. Craving for existence has been cut off; the conduit to existence has been destroyed; ${ }^{620}$ now there is no more renewed existence."

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this: [2]

"Virtuous behavior, concentration, wisdom, and unsurpassed liberation:
these things the illustrious Gotama understood by himself.

"Having directly known these things, the Buddha taught the Dhamma to the bhikkhus. The Teacher, the end-maker of suffering, the One with Vision, has attained nibbāna." ${ }^{\text {" }} 21$

# 2 (2) Fallen

At Sāvatthī. "Bhikkhus, one who does not possess four things is said to have fallen from this Dhamma and discipline. What four? (1) One who does not possess noble virtuous behavior is said to have fallen from this Dhamma and discipline. (2) One who does not possess noble concentration... (3) One who does not possess noble wisdom...(4) One who does not possess noble liberation is said to have fallen from this Dhamma and discipline. One who does not possess these four things is said to have fallen from this Dhamma and discipline.

"But, bhikkhus, one who possesses four things is said to be secure ${ }^{622}$ in this Dhamma and discipline. What four? (1) One who possesses noble virtuous behavior is said to be secure in this Dhamma and discipline. (2) One who possesses noble concentration... (3) One who possesses noble wisdom... (4) One who possesses noble liberation is said to be secure in this Dhamma and discipline. One who possesses these four things is said to be secure in this Dhamma and discipline."

Collapsed and fallen, they fall away;

the greedy ones come back again.

Done is the task, the delightful is delighted in;

happiness is reached by happiness. ${ }^{623}$

## 3 (3) Maimed (1)

"Bhikkhus, possessing four qualities, the foolish, incompetent, bad person maintains himself in a maimed and injured condition; he is blameworthy [3] and subject to reproach by the wise; and he generates much demerit. What four?

(1) "Without investigating and scrutinizing, he speaks praise of one who deserves dispraise. (2) Without investigating and scrutinizing, he speaks dispraise of one who deserves praise.
(3) Without investigating and scrutinizing, he believes a matter that merits suspicion. (4) Without investigating and scrutinizing, he is suspicious about a matter that merits belief. Possessing these four qualities, the foolish, incompetent, bad person maintains himself in a maimed and injured condition; he is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise; and he generates much demerit.

"Bhikkhus, possessing four qualities, the wise, competent, good person preserves himself unmaimed and uninjured; he is blameless and beyond reproach by the wise; and he generates much merit. What four?

(1)."Having investigated and scrutinized, he speaks dispraise of one who deserves dispraise. (2) Having investigated and scrutinized, he speaks praise of one who deserves praise. (3) Having investigated and scrutinized, he is suspicious about a matter that merits suspicion. (4) Having investigated and scrutinized, he believes a matter that merits belief. Possessing these four qualities, the wise, competent, good person preserves himself unmaimed and uninjured; he is blameless and beyond reproach by the wise; and he generates much merit."

He who praises one deserving blame, or blames one deserving praise, casts with his mouth an unlucky throw by which he finds no happiness. ${ }^{624}$

Slight is the unlucky throw at dice that results in the loss of one's wealth, [the loss] of all, oneself included; much worse is this unlucky throw of harboring hate against the fortunate ones. ${ }^{625}$

For a hundred thousand and thirty-six

nirabbudas, plus five abbudas, [4]

the slanderer of noble ones goes to hell,

having defamed them with evil speech and mind. ${ }^{626}$

4 (4) Maimed (2)

"Bhikkhus, behaving wrongly toward four persons, the foolish, incompetent, bad person maintains himself in a maimed and
injured condition; he is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise; and he generates much demerit. What four? (1) Behaving wrongly toward his mother, the foolish, incompetent, bad person maintains himself in a maimed and injured condition; he is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise; and he generates much demerit. (2) Behaving wrongly toward his father... (3) Behaving wrongly toward the Tathāgata... (4) Behaving wrongly toward a disciple of the Tathāgata... Behaving wrongly toward these four persons, the foolish, incompetent, bad person maintains himself in a maimed and injured condition; he is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise; and he generates much demerit.

"Bhikkhus, behaving rightly toward four persons, the wise, competent, good person preserves himself unmaimed and uninjured; he is blameless and beyond reproach by the wise; and he generates much merit. What four? (1) Behaving rightly toward his mother, the wise, competent, good person preserves himself unmaimed and uninjured; he is blameless and beyond reproach by the wise; and he generates much merit. (2) Behaving rightly toward his father... (3) Behaving rightly toward the Tathāgata... (4) Behaving rightly toward a disciple of the Tathāgata... Behaving rightly toward these four persons, the wise, competent, good person preserves himself unmaimed and uninjured; he is blameless and beyond reproach by the wise; and he generates much merit."

A person who behaves wrongly toward his mother and father, toward the enlightened Tathāgata, or toward his disciple, [5] generates much demerit.

Because of that unrighteous conduct toward mother and father, the wise criticize one here in this world and after death one goes to the plane of misery.

A person who behaves rightly toward his mother-and father, toward the enlightened Tathāgata,
or toward his disciple, generates much merit.

Because of that righteous conduct toward mother and father, the wise praise one in this world and after death one rejoices in heaven. ${ }^{627}$

# 5 (5) Along with the Stream

"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? The person who goes along with the stream; the one who goes against the stream; the one who is inwardly firm; and the one who has crossed over and gone beyond, the brahmin who stands on high ground. ${ }^{628}$

(1) "And what is the person who goes along with the stream? Here, someone indulges in sensual pleasures and performs bad deeds. This is called the person who goes along with the stream.

(2) "And what is the person who goes against the stream? Here, someone does not indulge in sensual pleasures or perform bad deeds. Even with pain and dejection, weeping with a tearful face, he lives the complete and purified spiritual life. This is called the person who goes against the stream.

(3) "And what is the person who is inwardly firm? Here, with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, some person is of spontaneous birth, due to attain final nibbāna there without ever returning from that world. This is called the person who is inwardly firm.

(4) "And what is the one who has crossed over and gone beyond, the brahmin who stands on high ground? [6] Here, with the destruction of the taints, some person has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. This is called the person who has crossed over and gone beyond, the brahmin who stands on high ground.

"These bhikkhus, are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world."

Those people who are uncontrolled in sense pleasures, not rid of lust, enjoying sense pleasures here,
repeatedly coming back to ${ }^{639}$ birth and old age, immersed in craving, are "the ones who go along with the stream."

Therefore a wise person with mindfulness established, not resorting to sense pleasures and bad deeds, should give up sense pleasures even if it's painful: they call this person "one who goes against the stream."

One who has abandoned five defilements, a fulfilled trainee, ${ }^{630}$ unable to retrogress, attained to mind's mastery, his faculties composed: this person is called "one inwardly firm."

One who has comprehended things high and low, burnt them up, so they're gone and exist no more: that sage who has lived the spiritual life, reached the world's end, is called "one who has gone beyond."

# 6 (6) One of Little Learning

"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? One of little learning who is not intent on what he has learned; one of little learning who is intent on what he has learned; one of much learning who is not intent on what he has learned; and one of much learning who is intent on what he has learned.

(1) "And how is a person one of little learning who is not intent on what he has learned? [7] Here, someone has learned little-that is, of the discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts, and questions-and-answers ${ }^{631}$-but he does not understand the meaning of what he has learned; he does not understand the Dhamma; and he does not practice in accordance with the Dhamma. In such a way, a person is one of little learning who is not intent on what he has learned.

(2) "And how is a person one of little learning who is intent on what he has learned? Here, someone has learned littlethat is, of the discourses . . . questions-and-answers-but having understood the meaning of what he has learned, and having
understood the Dhamma, he practices in accordance with the Dhamma. In such a way, a person is one of little learning who is intent on what he has learned.

(3) "And how is a person one of much learning who is not intent on what he has learned? Here, someone has learned much-that is, of the discourses . . . questions-and-answersbut he does not understand the meaning of what he has learned; he does not understand the Dhamma; and he does not practice in accordance with the Dhamma. In such a way, a person is one of much learning who is not intent on what he has learned.

(4) "And how is a person one of much learning who is intent on what he has learned? Here, someone has learned muchthat is, of the discourses ... questions-and-answers-and having understood the meaning of what he has learned, and having understood the Dhamma, he practices in accordance with the Dhamma. In such a way, a person is one of much learning who is intent on what he has learned.

"These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world."

If one has little learning and is not settled in the virtues, they criticize him on both counts, virtuous behavior and learning.

If one has little learning but is well settled in the virtues, they praise him for his virtuous behavior; his learning has succeeded. ${ }^{632}$

If one is highly learned but is not settled in the virtues, they criticize him for his lack of virtue; his learning has not succeeded. [8]

If one is highly learned and is settled in the virtues, they praise him on both counts, virtuous behavior and learning.

When a disciple of the Buddha is highly learned, an expert on the Dhamma, endowed with wisdom, like a coin of refined mountain gold, who is fit to blame him?

Even the devas praise such a one;

by Brahmā too he is praised.

# 7 (7) They Adorn

"Bhikkhus, these four kinds of persons who are competent, disciplined, self-confident, learned, experts on the Dhamma, practicing in accordance with the Dhamma, adorn the Sangha. What four?

(1) "A bhikkhu who is competent, disciplined, self-confident, learned, an expert on the Dhamma, practicing in accordance with the Dhamma, adorns the Sangha. (2) A bhikkhunī who is competent...(3) A male lay follower who is competent...(4) A female lay follower who is competent, disciplined, selfconfident, learned, an expert on the Dhamma, practicing in accordance with the Dhamma, adorns the Sangha.

"Bhikkhus, these four kinds of persons who are competent, disciplined, self-confident, learned, upholders of the Dhamma, practicing in accordance with the Dhamma, adorn the Sangha."

One who is competent and self-confident, learned, an expert on the Dhamma, practicing in accord with the Dhamma, is called an adornment of the Sangha.

A bhikkhu accomplished in virtue, a learned bhikkhunī, a male lay follower endowed with faith, a female lay follower endowed with faith: these are the ones that adorn the Sangha; these are the Sangha's adornments.

8 (8) Self-Confidence

"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of self-confidence that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he claims the place of the chief bull, [9] roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the brahma wheel. ${ }^{633}$ What four?
(1) "I do not see any ground on the basis of which an ascetic or brahmin or deva or Māra or Brahmā or anyone in the world might reasonably reprove me, saying: 'Though you claim to be perfectly enlightened, you are not fully enlightened about these things.' Since I do not see any such ground, I dwell secure, fearless, and self-confident.

(2) "I do not see any ground on the basis of which an ascetic or brahmin or deva or Māra or Brahmā or anyone in the world might reasonably reprove me, saying: 'Though you claim to be one whose taints are destroyed, you have not fully destroyed these taints.' Since I do not see any such ground, I dwell secure, fearless, and self-confident.

(3) "I do not see any ground on the basis of which an ascetic or brahmin or deva or Māra or Brahmā or anyone in the world might reasonably reprove me, saying: 'These things that you have said to be obstructive are not able to obstruct one who engages in them.' Since I do not see any such ground, I dwell secure, fearless, and self-confident.

(4) "I do not see any ground on the basis of which an ascetic or brahmin or deva or Māra or Brahmā or anyone in the world might reasonably reprove me, saying: 'The Dhamma does not lead one who practices it to the complete destruction of suffering, the goal for the sake of which you teach it. ${ }^{1334}$ Since I do not see any such ground, I dwell secure, fearless, and selfconfident.

"These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of self-confidence that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he claims the place of the chief bull, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the wheel of Brahmā."

These pathways of doctrine, formulated in diverse ways; relied upon by ascetics and brahmins, do not reach the Tathāgata, the self-confident one who has passed beyond the pathways of doctrine. ${ }^{635}$

Consummate, having overcome [everything], he set in motion the wheel of Dhamma out of compassion for all beings.

Beings pay homage to such a one,
the best among devas and humans, who has gone beyond existence. [10]

# 9 (9) Craving

"Bhikkhus, there are these four ways in which craving arises in a bhikkhu. What four? Craving arises in a bhikkhu because of robes, almsfood, lodgings, or for the sake of life here or elsewhere. ${ }^{636}$ These are the four ways in which craving arises in a bhikkhu."

With craving as companion

a person wanders during this long time.

Going from one state to another,

he does not overcome samsāra.

Having known this danger-

that craving is the origin of suffering-

free from craving, devoid of grasping,

a bhikkhu should wander mindfully.

## 10 (10) Bonds

"Bhikkhus, there are these four bonds. What four? The bond of sensuality, the bond of existence, the bond of views, and the bond of ignorance.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the bond of sensuality? Here, someone does not understand as they really are the origin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to sensual pleasures. When one does not understand these things as they really are, then sensual lust, sensual delight, sensual affection, sensual infatuation, sensual thirst, sensual passion, sensual attachment, and sensual craving lie deep within one in regard to sensual pleasures. This is called the bond of sensuality.

(2) "Such is the bond of sensuality. And how is there the bond of existence? Here, someone does not understand as they really are the origin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to states of existence. ${ }^{637}$ When one does not understand these things as they really are, then lust for existence, delight in existence, affection for existence, infatuation with existence, thirst for existence, passion for
existence, attachment to existence, and craving for existence lie deep within one in regard to states of existence. This is called the bond of existence.

(3) "Such are the bond of sensuality and the bond of existence. And how is there the bond of views? Here, someone does not understand as they really are the origin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to views. When one does not understand these things as they really are, [11] then lust for views, delight in views, affection for views, infatuation with views, thirst for views, passion for views, attachment to views, and craving for views lie deep within one in regard to views. This is called the bond of views.

(4) "Such are the bond of sensuality, the bond of existence, and the bond of views. And how is there the bond of ignorance? Here, someone does not understand as they really are the origin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to the six bases for contact. When one does not understand these things as they really are, then, ignorance and unknowing lie deep within one in regard to the six bases for contact. This is called the bond of ignorance. Such are the bond of sensuality, the bond of existence, the bond of views, and the bond of ignorance.

"One is fettered by bad unwholesome states that are defiling, conducive to renewed existence, troublesome, ripening in suffering, leading to future birth, old age, and death; therefore one is said to be 'not secure from bondage.' These are the four bonds.

"There are, bhikkhus, these four severances of bonds. What four? The severance of the bond of sensuality, the severance of the bond of existence, the severance of the bond of views, and the severance of the bond of ignorance.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the severance of the bond of sensuality? Here, someone understands as they really are the origin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to sensual pleasures. When one understands these things as they really are, then sensual lust, sensual delight, sensual affection, sensual infatuation, sensual thirst, sensual passion, sensual attachment, and sensual craving do not lie within one in regard to sensual pleasures. This is called the severance of the bond of sensuality.
(2) "Such is the severance of the bond of sensuality. And how is there the severance of the bond of existence? Here, someone understands as they really are the origin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to states of existence. When one understands these things as they really are, then lust for existence, delight in existence, affection for existence, infatuation with existence, thirst for existence, passion for existence, attachment to existence, and craving for existence do not lie within one in regard to states of existence. This is called the severance of the bond of existence.

(3) "Such are the severance of the bond of sensuality and the severance of the bond of existence. And how is there the severance of the bond of views? Here, someone understands as they really are the origin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and [12] the escape in regard to views. When one understands these things as they really are, then lust for views, delight in views, affection for views, infatuation with views, thirst for views, passion for views, attachment to views, and craving for views do not lie within one in regard to views. This is called the severance of the bond of views.

(4) "Such are the severance of the bond of sensuality, the severance of the bond of existence, and the severance of the bond of views. And how is there the severance of the bond of ignorance? Here, someone understands as they really are the origin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to the six bases for contact. When one understands these things as they really are, then ignorance and unkiowing do not lie within one in regard to the six bases for contact. This is called the severance of the bond of ignorance. Such are the severance of the bond of sensuality, the severance of the bond of existence, the severance of the bond of views, and the severance of the bond of ignorance.

"One is detached from bad unwholesome states that are defiling, conducive to renewed existence, troublesome, ripening in suffering, leading to future birth, old age, and death; therefore one is said to be 'secure from bondage.' These are the four severances of bonds."

Fettered by the bond of sensuality and the bond of existence,
fettered by the bond of views, preceded by ignorance, beings go on in samsāra, led on in birth and death.

But having entirely understood sense pleasures and the bond of existence, having uprooted the bond of views and dissolved ignorance, the sages have severed all bonds; they have gone beyond bondage. ${ }^{638}$ [13]

# II. WALKING

11 (1) Walking ${ }^{639}$

(1) "Bhikkhus, if a sensual thought, a thought of ill will, or a thought of harming arises in a bhikkhu while walking, and he tolerates it, does not abandon it, dispel it, terminate it, and obliterate it, then that bhikkhu is said to be devoid of ardor and moral dread; he is constantly and continuously lazy and lacking in energy while walking.

(2) "If a sensual thought... arises in a bhikkhu while standing... (3) If a sensual thought : . . arises in a bhikkhu while sitting... (4) If a sensual thought, a thought of ill will, or a thought of harming arises in a bhikkhu while wakefully lying down, and he tolerates it, does not abandon it, dispel it, terminate it, and obliterate it, then that bhikkhu is said to be devoid of ardor and moral dread; he is constantly and continuously lazy and lacking in energy while wakefully lying down.

(1) "But, bhikkhus, if a sensual thought, a thought of ill will, or a thought of harming arises in a bhikkhu while walking, and he does not tolerate it but abandons it, dispels it, terminates it, and obliterates it, then that bhikkhu is said to be ardent and to dread wrongdoing; he is constantly and continuously energetic and resolute while walking.

(2) "If a sensual thought . . . arises in a bhikkhu while standing... (3) If a sensual thought . . . arises in a bhikkhu while sitting... (4) If a sensual thought, a thought of ill will, or a thought of harming arises in a bhikkhu while wakefully lying down,
and he does not tolerate it but abandons it, dispels it, terminates it, [14] and obliterates it, then that bhikkhu is said to be ardent and to dread wrongdoing; he is constantly and continuously energetic and resolute while walking."

Whether walking or standing, sitting or lying down, one who thinks bad thoughts connected with the household life has entered upon a dire path, infatuated by delusive things: such a bhikkhu cannot reach the highest enlightenment.

But one who, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, has calmed his thoughts and delights in the stilling of thought: a bhikkhu such as this can reach the highest enlightenment.

# 12 (2) Virtuous Behavior

"Bhikkhus, dwell observant of virtuous behavior, observant of the Pātimokkha. Dwell restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken them, train in the training rules. When you have done so, what further should be done?

(1) "Bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu has gotten rid of longing and ill will while walking; if he has abandoned dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt; ${ }^{640}$ if his energy is aroused without slackening; if his mindfulness is established and unmuddled; if his body is tranquil and undisturbed; if his mind is concentrated and one-pointed, then that bhikkhu is said to be ardent and to dread wrongdoing; he is constantly and continuously energetic and resolute while walking.

(2) "If a bhikkhu has gotten rid of longing and ill will while standing...(3) If a bhikkhu has gotten rid of longing and ill will while sitting...[15]...(4) If a bhikkhu has gotten rid of longing and ill will while wakefully lying down; if he has abandoned dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and
doubt; if his energy is aroused without slackening; if his mindfulness is established and unmuddled; if his body is tranquil and undisturbed; if his mind is concentrated and one-pointed, then that bhikkhu is said to be ardent and to dread wrongdoing; he is constantly and continuously energetic and resolute while wakefully lying down."

Controlled in walking, controlled in standing, controlled in sitting and in lying down; controlled, a bhikkhu draws in the limbs, and controlled, he stretches them out.

Above, across, and below, as far as the world extends, he is one who scrutinizes the arising and vanishing of such phenomena as the aggregates.

Training in what is conducive to serenity of mind, always mindful, they call such a bhikkhu one constantly resolute.

13 (3) Striving

"Bhikkhus, there are these four right strivings. What four? (1) Here, a bhikkhu generates desire for the non-arising of unarisen bad unwholesome states; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. (2) He generates desire for the abandoning of arisen bad unwholesome states; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. (3) He generates desire for the arising of unarisen wholesome states; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. (4) He generates desire for the persistence of arisen wholesome states, for their non-decline, increase, expansion, and fulfillment by development; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. These are the four right strivings."

Those who strive rightly overcome the realm of Māca; they are unattached, gone beyond fear of birth and death.

They are contented and unstirred, having conquered Māra and his mount; those happy ones have overcome all Namuci's armies. ${ }^{641}$ [16]

# 14 (4) Restraint

"Bhikkhus, there are these four strivings. What four? Striving by restraint, striving by abandonment, striving by development, and striving by protection.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is striving by restraint? Here, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu does not grasp its marks and features. Since, if he left the eye faculty unrestrained, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him, he practices restraint over it, he guards the eye faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. Having heard a sound with the ear . . . Having smelled an odor with the nose . . . Having tasted a taste with the tongue ... Having felt a tactile object with the body... Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, a bhikkhu does not grasp its marks and features. Since, if he left the mind faculty unrestrained, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him, he practices restraint over it, he guards the mind faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty. This is called striving by restraint.

(2) "And what is striving by abandonment? Here, a bhikkhu does not tolerate an arisen sensual thought; he abandons it, dispels it, terminates it, and obliterates it. He does not tolerate an arisen thought of ill will ... an arisen thought of harming ... bad unwholesome states whenever they arise; he abandons them, dispels them, terminates them, and obliterates them. This is called striving by abandonment.

(3) "And what is striving by development? Here, a bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness, which is based upon seclusion;dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release. He develops the enlightenment factor of discrimination of phenomena . . . the enlightenment factor of energy . . . the enlightenment factor of rapture . . . the enlightenment factor of tranquility ... the enlightenment factor of concentration ... the enlightenment factor of equanimity, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, andcessation, maturing in release. This is called striving by development. [17]
(4) "And what is striving by protection? Here, a bhikkhu protects an arisen excellent object of concentration: ${ }^{642}$ the perception of a skeleton, the perception of a worm-infested corpse, the perception of a livid corpse, the perception of a festering corpse, the perception of a fissured corpse, the perception of a bloated corpse. This is called striving by protection.

"These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of striving."

Restraint and abandonment, development and protection: these four strivings were taught by the Kinsman of the Sun.

By these means an ardent bhikkhu here can attain the destruction of suffering.

15 (5) Proclamations

"Bhikkhus, there are these four proclamations of the foremost. What four?

(1) "The foremost of those with bodies is Rāhu, lord of the asuras. ${ }^{643}$ (2) The foremost of those who enjoy sensual pleasures is King Mandhātā. ${ }^{6+4}$ (3) The foremost of those who exercise authority is Māra the Evil One. (4) In this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, among this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One is declared foremost. These are the four proclamations of those who are foremost."

Rāhu is the foremost of those with bodies, Mandhātā, of those enjoying sense pleasures;

Māra is the foremost of rulers, blazing with power and glory.

In this world together with its devas above, across, and below, as far as the world extends, the Buddha is declared foremost.

16 (6) Exquisiteness

"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of exquisiteness. ${ }^{645}$ What four? (1) Here, a bhikkhu possesses supreme exquisiteness of
form. He does not perceive any other exquisiteness of form more excellent or sublime than that one; he does not yearn for any other exquisiteness of form more excellent or sublime than that one. (2) He possesses supreme exquisiteness of feeling [18]...(3)...supreme exquisiteness of perception...(4)...supreme exquisiteness of volitional activities. He does not perceive any other exquisiteness of volitional activities more excellent or sublime than that one; he does not yearn for any other exquisiteness of volitional activities more excellent or sublime than that one.

"These are the four kinds of exquisiteness."

Having known the exquisiteness of form, the origination of feelings,

how perception arises,

and where it disappears;

having known volitional activities

as alien, as suffering, and not as self,

truly that bhikkhu who sees rightly, ${ }^{546}$

peaceful, delights in the peaceful state.

He bears his final body,

having conquered Māra and his mount.

17 (7) Wrong Courses (1)

"Bhikkhus, there are these four ways of taking a wrong course. What four? One takes a wrong course because of desire, because of hatred, because of delusion, or because of fear. These are the four ways of taking a wrong course."

If through desire, hate, fear, or delusion one transgresses against the Dhamma, one's fame diminishes like the moon in the dark fortnight.

18 (8) Wrong Courses (2)

"Bhikkhus, there are these four ways of not taking a wrong course. What four? One does not take a wrong course because of desire, because of hatred, because of delusion, or because of fear. These are the four ways of not taking a wrong course."

If one does not transgress the Dhamma through desire, hate, fear, or delusion, one's fame becomes full like the moon in the bright fortnight.

19 (9) Wrong Courses (3)

"Bhikkhus, there are these four ways of taking a wrong course. What four? [19] One takes a wrong course because of desire ... [as in 4:17]...These are the four ways of taking a wrong course.

"Bhikkhus, there are these four ways of not taking a wrong course. What four? One does not take a wrong course because of desire ... [as in 4:18]... These are the four ways of taking a wrong course."

If through desire, hate, fear, or delusion one transgresses against the Dhamma, one's fame diminishes like the moon in the dark fortnight.

If one does not transgress the Dhamma through desire, hate, fear, or delusion, one's fame becomes full like the moon in the bright fortnight.

20 (10) An Assigner of Meals

"Bhikkhus, if an assigner of meals ${ }^{647}$ possesses four qualities, he is deposited in hell as if brought there. What four? He takes a wrong course because of desire, because of hatred, because of delusion, or because of fear. If an assigner of meals possesses these four qualities, he is deposited in hell as if brought there.

"Bhikkhus, if an assigner of meals possesses four qualities, he is deposited in heaven as if brought there. What four? He does not take a wrong course because of desire, because of hatred, because of delusion, or because of fear. If an assigner of meals possesses these four qualities, he is deposited in heaven as if brought there."

Those people uncontrolled in sensual pleasures, who are unrighteous, not revering the Dhamma, gone [astray] through desire, hate, and fear ${ }^{648}$
are called a stained assembly.

Such is said by the Ascetic who knows.

Therefore those good persons who are praiseworthy, firm in the Dhamma, who do nothing bad, unswayed by desire, hate, and fear, are called an elite assembly.

Such is said by the Ascetic who knows. [20]

# III. Uruvela

21 (1) Uruvela (1) ${ }^{649}$

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, on one occasion I was dwelling at Uruvelā, by the goatherds' banyan tree on the bank of the Neranjarā River, just after I had attained full enlightenment. Then, while I was alone in seclusion, a course of thought arose in my mind thus: 'It is painful to dwell without reverence and deference. Now what ascetic or brahmin can I honor, respect, and dwell in dependence on?'

"Then it occurred to me: (1) 'If my aggregate of virtuous behavior were incomplete, for the sake of completing it I would honor, respect, and dwell in dependence on another ascetic or brahmin. However, in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, among this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, I do not see another ascetic or brahmin more accomplished in virtuous behavior than myself whom I could honor, respect, and dwell in dependence on.

(2) "If my aggregate of concentration were incomplete, for the sake of completing it I would honor, respect, and dwell in dependence on another ascetic or brahmin. However . . I do not see another ascetic or brahmin more accomplished in concentration than myself....

(3) "If my aggregate of wisdom were incomplete, for the sake of completing it I would honor, respect, and dwell in dependence on another ascetic or brahmin. However...I do not see
another ascetic or brahmin more accomplished in wisdom than myself...

(4) "'If my aggregate of liberation were incomplete, for the sake of completing it I would honor, respect, and dwell in dependence on another ascetic or brahmin. However, in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, among this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, I do not see another ascetic or brahmin more accomplished in liberation than myself whom I could honor, respect, and dwell in dependence on.

"It occurred to me: 'Let me then honor, respect, and dwell in dependence only on this Dhamma to which I have become fully enlightened.'

"Then Brahmā Sahampati, [21] having known with his own mind the reflection in my mind, disappeared from the brahmā world and reappeared before me just as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm. He arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, bent down with his right knee on the ground, reverently saluted me, and said: 'So it is, Blessed One! So it is, Fortunate One! Bhante, those who were the Arahants, the Perfectly Enlightened Ones in the past-those Blessed Ones, too, honored, respected, and dwelled in dependence only on the Dhamma: Those who will be the Arahants, the Perfectly Enlightened Ones in the future-those Blessed Ones, too, will honor, respect, and dwell in dependence only on the Dhamma. Let the Blessed One, too, who is at present the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, honor, respect, and dwell in dependence only on the Dhamma.'

"This is what Brahmā Sahampati said. Having said this, he further said this:

"'The perfect Buddhas of the past, the Buddhas of the future, and the present Buddha who removes the sorrow of many: all those dwelled, now dwell, and [in the future] will dwell

revering the good Dhamma.

This is the nature of the Buddhas.
"Therefore one desiring the good, ${ }^{650}$

aspiring for greatness,

should revere the good Dhamma, recollecting the Buddhas' teaching.'

"This was what Brahmā Sahampati said. He then paid homage to me, and keeping me on his right, he disappeared right there. Then, having acknowledged Brahmā's request and what was proper for myself, I honored, respected, and dwelled in dependence only on the Dhamma to which I had become fully enlightened. And now that the Sangha has acquired greatness, I have respect for the Sangha, too." [22]

# 22 (2) Uruvelā (2)

"Bhikkhus, on one occasion I was dwelling at Uruvelā, by the goatherds' banyan tree on the bank of the Neranjarā River, just after I had attained full enlightenment. Then a number of brahmins, old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage, approached me and exchanged greetings with me. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, they sat down to one side and said to me:

"We have heard, Master Gotama: "The ascetic Gotama does not pay homage to brahmins who are old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage; nor does he stand up for them or offer them a seat." This is indeed true, for Master Gotama does not pay homage to brahmins who are old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage; nor does he stand up for them or offer them a seat. This is not proper, Master Gotama. ${ }^{\text {6s1 }}$

"It then occurred to me: These venerable ones do not know what an elder is or what the qualities that make one an elder are. Even though someone is old-eighty, ninety, or a hundred years from birth-if he speaks at an improper time, speaks falsely, speaks what is unbeneficial, speaks contrary to the Dhamma and the discipline, if at an improper time he speaks words that are worthless, unreasonable, rambling, and unbeneficial, then he is reckoned as a foolish [childish] elder.

"But even though someone is young, a youth with black hair, endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life, if he speaks at a proper time, speaks what is truthful, speaks what
is beneficial, speaks on the Dhamma and the discipline, and if at a proper time he speaks words that are worth recording, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial, then he is reckoned as a wise elder.

"There are, bhikkhus, these four qualities that make one an elder. What four?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them.

(2) "He has learned much, [23] remembers what he has learned, and accumulates what he has learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life-such teachings as these he has learned much of, retained in mind, recited verbally, investigated with the mind, and penetrated well by view.

(3) "He is one who gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life.

(4) "With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.

"These are the four qualities that make one an elder."

The dullard with a restless mind ${ }^{652}$

who speaks much chatter,

his thoughts unsettled,

delighting in a bad teaching,

holding bad views, disrespectful,

is far from an elder's stature.

But one accomplished in virtue,

learned and discerning,

self-controlled in the factors of firmness,

who clearly sees the meaning with wisdom;

gone beyond all phenomena,

not barren, discerning; ${ }^{653}$
who has abandoned birth and death, consummate in the spiritual life, in whom there are no taints-

he is the one I call an elder.

With the destruction of the taints

a bhikkhu is called an elder.

23 (3) The World ${ }^{654}$.

"Bhikkhus, the Tathāgata has fully awakened to the world; ${ }^{655}$ the Tathāgata is detached from the world. The Tathāgata has fully awakened to the origin of the world; the Tathāgata has abandoned the origin of the world. The Tathāgata has fully awakened to the cessation of the world; the Tathāgata has realized the cessation of the world. The Tathāgata has fully awakened to the way leading to the cessation of the world; the Tathāgata has developed the way leading to the cessation of the world.

(1) "Bhikkhus, in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, among this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, [24] examined by the mind-all that the Tathāgata has fully awakened to; therefore he is called the Tathāgata. ${ }^{656}$

(2) "Bhikkhus, whatever the Tathāgata speaks, utters, or expounds in the interval between the night when he awakens to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment and the night when he attains final nibbāna, ${ }^{657}$ all that is just so and not otherwise; therefore he is called the Tathāgata. ${ }^{658}$

(3) "Bhikkhus, as the Tathāgata speaks, so he does;as he does, so he speaks. Since he does as he speaks and speaks as he does, therefore he is called the Tathāgata. ${ }^{659}$

(4) "Bhikkhus, in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, among this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans; the Tathāgata is the vanquisher, the unvanquished, the universal seer, the wielder of mastery; therefore he is called the Tathāgata."

Having directly known all the worldall in the world just as it is-

he is detached from all the world, disengaged from all the world.

He is the vanquisher of all, the wise one who has untied all knots. He has reached the supreme peace, nibbāna, inaccessible to fear.

He is the Buddha, his taints destroyed, untroubled, all doubts cut off; having reached the destruction of all kamma, he is liberated in the extinction of acquisitions.

He is the Blessed One, the Buddha, he is the lion unsurpassed; in this world with its devas, he set in motion the wheel of Brahmā.

Thus those devas and human beings who have gone for refuge to the Buddha assemble and pay homage to himi, the great one free from diffidence:

"Tamed, he is the best of tamers; peaceful, he is the seer among peace-bringers; freed, he is the chief of liberators; crossed over, he is the best of guides across."

Thus indeed they pay him homage, the great one free from diffidence. In this world together with its devas, there is no one who can rival you.

# 24 (4) Kālaka

[Thus have I heard. ${ }^{600}$ On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāketa, at Kālaka's Park. ${ }^{661}$ There the Blessed One addiessed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this: [25]

"Bhikkhus, in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, among this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, examined by the mind-that I know.

"Bhikkhus, in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā,
among this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, examined by the mind-that I have directly known. It has been known by the Tathāgata, ${ }^{662}$ but the Tathāgata did not become subservient to it. ${ }^{663}$

"Bhikkhus, if I were to say, 'In this world with its devas . . . whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, examined by the mind-that I do not know,' that would be a falsehood on my part.

"Bhikkhus, if I were to say, 'In this world with its devas . . . whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, examined by the mind-that I both know and do not know,' that too would be just the same. ${ }^{664}$

"Bhikkhus, if I were to say, 'In this world with its devas . . . whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, examined by the mind-that I neither know nor do not know,' that would be a fault on my part. ${ }^{665}$

(1) "So, having seen what can be seen, the Tathāgata does not misconceive the seen, does not misconceive the unseen, does not misconceive what can be seen, does not misconceive one who sees. ${ }^{666}$ (2) Having heard what can be heard, he does not misconceive the heard, does not misconceive the unheard, does not misconceive what can be heard, does not misconceive one who hears: (3) Having sensed what can be sensed, he does not misconceive the sensed, does not misconceive the unsensed, does not misconceive what can be sensed, does not misconceive one who senses. (4) Having cognized what can be cognized, he does not misconceive the cognized, does not misconceive the uncognized, does not misconceive what can be cognized, does not misconceive one who cognizes.

"Thus, bhikkhus, being ever stable among things seen, heard, sensed, and cognized, the Tathāgata is a stable one. ${ }^{667}$ And, I say, there is no stable one more excellent or sublime than that stable one."

Amid those who are self-constrained, the Stable One would not posit as categorically true or false anything seen, heard, or sensed, clung to and considered truth by others. ${ }^{668}$

Since they have already seen this dart ${ }^{600}$ to which people cling and adhere, [26] [saying] "I know, I see, it is just so," the Tathāgatas cling to nothing.

# 25 (5) The Spiritual Life

"Bhikkhus, this spiritual life is not lived for the sake of deceiving people and cajoling them; nor for the benefit of gain, honor, and praise; nor for the benefit of winning in debates; nor with the thought: 'Let the people know me thus.' But rather, this spiritual life is lived for the sake of restraint, abandoning, dispassion, and cessation." ${ }^{\prime 670}$

The Blessed One taught the spiritual life, not based on tradition, culminating in nibbāna, lived for the sake of restraint and abandoning. ${ }^{671}$

This is the path of the great beings, ${ }^{672}$ the path followed by the great seers.

Those who practice it as taught by the Buddha, acting upon the Teacher's guidance, will make an end of suffering.

## 26 (6) Deceivers ${ }^{673}$

(1) "Bhikkhus, those bhikkhus who are deceivers, stubborn, talkers, imposters, haughty, and unconcentrated are not bhikkhus of mine. ${ }^{674}$ (2) They have strayed from this Dhamma and discipline, and they do not achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline. (3) But those bhikkhus who are honest, sincere, steadfast, compliant, and well concentrated are bhikkhus of mine. (4) They have not strayed from this Dhamma and discipline, and they achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline."

Those who are deceivers, stubborn, talkers, imposters, haughty, unconcentrated, do not make progress in the Dhamma that the Perfectly Enlightened One has taught.

But those who are honest and sincere, steadfast, compliant, and well concentrated, make progress in the Dhamma that the Perfectly Enlightened One has taught.

# 27 (7) Contentment

"Bhikkhus, there are these four trifles, easily gained and blameless. What four?

(1) "A rag-robe is a trifle among robes, easily gained [27] and blameless. (2) A lump of almsfood is a trifle among meals, easily gained and blameless. (3) The foot of a tree is a trifle among lodgings, easily gained and blameless. (4) Putrid urine is a trifle among medicines, easily gained and blameless. ${ }^{675}$

"These are the four trifles, easily gained and blameless. When a bhikkhu is satisfied with what is trifling and easily gained, I say that he has one of the factors of the ascetic life."

When one is content with what is blameless, trifling and easily gained; when one's mind is not distressed because of a lodging, robe, drink, and food, one is not hindered anywhere. ${ }^{676}$

These qualities, rightly said to conform to the ascetic life, are acquired by a bhikkhu ${ }^{677}$ who is content and heedful.

## 28 (8) Noble Lineages ${ }^{678}$

"Bhikkhus, there are these four noble lineages, primal, of long standing, traditional, ancient, unadulterated and never before adulterated, which are not being adulterated and will not be adulterated, which are not repudiated by wise ascetics and brahmins. What four?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is content with any kind of robe, and he speaks in praise of contentment with any kind of robe, and he does not engage in a wrong search, in what is improper, for the sake of a robe. ${ }^{679}$ If he does not get a robe he is not agitated, and if he gets one he uses it without being tied to it, infatuated
with it, and blindly absorbed in it, seeing the danger in it and understanding the escape from it. Yet he does not extol himself or disparage others because of this. Any bhikkhu who is skillful in this, diligent, clearly comprehending and ever mindful, is said to be standing in an ancient, primal noble lineage.

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu is content with any kind of almsfood, and he speaks in praise of contentment with any kind of almsfood, and he does not engage in a wrong search, in what is improper, for the sake of almsfood. If he does not get almsfood he is not agitated, and if he gets some he uses it without being tied to it, infatuated with it, and blindly absorbed in it, seeing the danger in it and understanding the escape from it. [28] Yet he does not extol himself or disparage others because of this. Any bhikkhu who is skillful in this, diligent, clearly comprehending and ever mindful, is said to be standing in an ancient, primal noble lineage.

(3) "Again, a bhikkhu is content with any kind of lodging, and he speaks in praise of contentment with any kind of lodging, and he does not engage in a wrong search, in what is improper, for the sake of lodging. If he does not get lodging he is not agitated, and if he gets it he uses it without being tied to it, infatuated with it, and blindly absorbed in it, seeing the danger in it and understanding the escape from it. Yet he does not extol himself or disparage others because of this. Any bhikkhu who is skillful in this, diligent, clearly comprehending and ever mindful, is said to be standing in an ancient, primal noble lineage.

(4) "Again, a bhikkhu finds delight in development, is delighted with development, finds delight in abandoning, is delighted with abandoning. ${ }^{680}$ Yet he does not extol himself or disparage others because of this. Any bhikkhu who is skillful in this, diligent, clearly comprehending and ever mindful, is said to be standing in an ancient, primal noble lineage.

"These, bhikkhus, are the four noble lineages, primal, of long standing, traditional, ancient, unadulterated and never before adulterated, which are not being adulterated and will not be adulterated, which are not repudiated by wise ascetics and brahmins.

"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu possesses these four noble lineages, if he dwells in the east he vanquishes discontent,
discontent does not vanquish him; if he dwells in the west he vanquishes discontent, discontent does not vanquish him; if he dwells in the north he vanquishes discontent, discontent does not vanquish him; if he dwells in the south he vanquishes discontent, discontent does not vanquish him. For what reason? Because he is a steadfast one who vanquishes discontent and delight."

Discontent does not vanquish the steadfast one, ${ }^{681}$

[for] the steadfast one is not variquished by discontent. ${ }^{682}$

The steadfast one vanquishes discontent,

for the steadfast one is a vanquisher of discontent. [29]

Who can obstruct the dispeller

who has discarded all kamma?

Who is fit to blame one who is like

a coin of refined gold?

Even the devas praise such a one;

by Brahmā too he is praised.

29 (9) Dhamma Factors

"Bhikkhus, there are these four Dhamma factors, ${ }^{683}$ primal, of long standing, traditional, ancient, unadulterated and never before adulterated, which are not being adulterated and will not be adulterated, which are not repudiated by wise ascetics and brahmins. What four?

(1) "Non-longing is a Dhamma factor, primal, of long standing, traditional, ancient, unadulterated and never before adulterated, which is not being adulterated and will not be adulterated, which is not repudiated by wise ascetics and brahmins. (2) Good will is a Dhamma factor, primal, of long standing... (3) Right mindfulness is a Dhamma factor, primal, of long standing... (4) Right concentration is a Dhamma factor, primal, of long standing... not repudiated by wise ascetics and brahmins.

"These are the four Dhamma factors, primal, of long standing, traditional, ancient, unadulterated and never before adulterated, which are not being adulterated and will not be adulterated, which are not repudiated by wise ascetics and brahmins."

One should dwell free from longing with a heart of good will.

One should be mindful and one-pointed in mind, internally well concentrated.

# 30 (10) Wanderers

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Now on that occasion a number of very well-known wanderers were residing at the wanderers' park on the bank of the river Sappini, namely, Annabhāra, Varadhara, Sakuludāyī the wanderer, and other very well-known wanderers.

Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and went to the wanderers' park on the bank of the Sappini. He sat down on a seat that was prepared and said to those wanderers: "Wanderers, there are these four Dhamma factors that are primal, [30] of long standing, traditional, ancient, unadulterated and never before adulterated, which are not being adulterated and will not be adulterated, which are not repudiated by wise ascetics and brahmins. What four?

(1) "Non-longing is a Dhamma factor that is primal, of long standing, traditional, ancient, unadulterated and never before adulterated, which is not being adulterated and will not be adulterated, which is not repudiated by wise ascetics and brahmins. (2) Good will is a Dhamma factor that is primal, of long standing...(3) Right mindfulness is a Dhamma factor that is primal, of long standing... (4) Right concentration is a Dhamma factor that is primal, of long standing . . . not repudiated by wise ascetics and brahmins.

"These are the four Dhamma factors that are primal, of long standing, traditional, ancient, unadulterated and never before adulterated, which are not being adulterated and will not be adulterated, which are not repudiated by wise ascetics and brahmins.

(1) "If, wanderers, anyone should say: 'I will reject this Dhamma factor of non-longing and point out a [real] ascetic or brahmin who is full of longing, deeply passionate about sensual pleasures,' I would respond to him thus: 'Let him come, speak, and converse. Let me see how mighty he is!' Indeed, it would be impossible for him to reject non-longing as a Dhamma factor
and to point out a [real] ascetic or brahmin who is full of longing, deeply passionate about sensual pleasures.

(2) "If anyone should say: 'I will reject this Dhamma factor of good will and point out a [real] ascetic or brahmin who has a mind of ill will and intentions of hate,' I would respond to him thus: 'Let him come, speak, and converse. Let me see how mighty he is!' Indeed, it would be impossible for him to reject good will as a Dhamma factor and to point out a [real] ascetic or brahmin who has a mind of ill will and intentions of hate.

(3) "If anyone should say: 'I will reject this Dhamma factor of right mindfulness and point out a [real] ascetic or brahmin who is muddled in mind and lacks clear comprehension,' I would respond to him thus: 'Let him come, speak, and converse. Let me see how mighty he is!' Indeed, it would be impossible for him to reject right mindfulness as a Dhamma factor and to point out a [real] ascetic or brahmin who is muddled in mind and lacks clear comprehension.

(4) "If anyone should say: 'I will reject this Dhamma factor of right concentration and point out a [real] ascetic or brahmin who is unconcentrated, with a wandering mind,' I would respond to him thus: 'Let him come, speak, [31] and converse. Let me see how mighty he is!' Indeed, it would be impossible for him to reject right concentration as a Dhamma factor and to point out a [real] ascetic or brahmin who is unconcentrated, with a wandering mind.

"If, wanderers, anyone thinks these four Dhamma factors should be censured and repudiated, then, in this very life, he incurs four reasonable criticisms and grounds for censure. ${ }^{684}$ What four?

"If you censure and repudiate this Dhamma factor of nonlonging, then you must regard as worthy of worship and praise those ascetics and brahmins who are full of longing and deeply passionate about sensual pleasures. If you censure and repudiate this Dhamma factor of good will, then you must regard as worthy of wortship and praise those ascetics and brahmins who have minds of ill will and intentions of hate. If you censure and repudiate this Dhamma factor of right mindfulness, then you must regard as worthy of worship and praise those ascetics and brahmins who are muddle-minded and lack clear comprehension. If you censure and repudiate this Dhamma factor of right
concentration, then you must regard as worthy of worship and praise those ascetics and brahmins who are unconcentrated, with wandering minds.'

"If, wanderers, anyone thinks these four Dhamma factors should be censured and repudiated, then, in this very life, he incurs these four reasonable criticisms and grounds for censure. Even those wanderers Vassa and Bhañña of Ukkalā, who were proponents of non-causality, inactivity, and nihilism, did not think that these four Dhamma factors should be censured and repudiated. For what reason? From fear of blame, attack, and refutation. ${ }^{\prime \prime 685}$

One of good will, ever mindful, inwardly well concentrated, training to remove longing, is said to be heedful. [32]

# IV. Tite WheEL

## 31 (1) The Wheel

"Bhikkhus, there are these four wheels. When these four wheels turn, those devas and humans who possess them soon attain greatness and abundance of wealth: What four? Dwelling in a suitable locality, relying on good persons, right resolution, and merits done in the past. ${ }^{686}$ These are the four wheels. When these four wheels turn, those devas and humans who possess them soon attain greatness and abundance of wealth."

When a person dwells in a suitable locality and makes friends with the noble ones, when he has formed right resolutions, and done deeds of merit in the past, grain, riches, fame, and reputation, along with happiness accrue to him.

## 32 (2) Sustaining

"Bhikkhus, there are these four means of sustaining a favorable relationship. What four? Giving, endearing speech, beneficent conduct, and impartiality. ${ }^{687}$ These are the four means of sus. taining a favorable relationship."

Giving, endearing speech, beneficent conduct, and impartiality under diverse worldly conditions, as is suitable to fit each case: these means of sustaining a favorable relationship are like the linchpin of a rolling chariot.

If there were no such means of sustaining a favorable relationship, neither mother nor father would be able to obtain esteem and veneration from their children.

But since there exist these means of sustaining a favorable relationship, wise people respect them; thus they attain to greatness and are highly praised. [33]

# 33 (3) The Lion

"Bhikkhus, in the evening the lion, the king of beasts, comes out from his lair, stretches his body, surveys the four quarters all around, and roars his lion's roar three times. Then he sets out in search of game.

"Whatever animals hear the lion roaring for the most part are filled with fear, a sense of urgency, and terror. Those who live in holes enter their holes; those who live in the water enter the water; those who live in the woods enter the woods; and the birds resort to the sky. Even those royal bull elephants, bound by strong thongs in the villages, towns, and capital cities, burst and break their bonds asunder; frightened, they urinate and defecate and flee here and there. So powerful among the animals is the lion, the king of beasts, so majestic and mighty.

"So too, bhikkhus, when the Tathāgata arises in the world, an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One, he teaches the Dhamma thus: '(1) Such is personal existence, (2) such the origin of personal existence, (3) such the cessation of personal existence, (4) such the way to the cessation of personal existence. ${ }^{\text {'688 }}$
"When those devas who are long-lived, beautiful, abounding in happiness, dwelling for a long time in lofty palaces, hear the Tathāgata's teaching of the Dhamma, for the most part they are filled with fear, a sense of urgency, and terror thus: ${ }^{699}$ 'It seems that we are actually impermanent, though we thought ourselves permanent; it seems that we are actually transient, though we thought ourselves everlasting; it seems that we are actually non-eternal, though we thought ourselves eternal. It seems that we are impermanent, transient, non-eternal, included in personal existence. ${ }^{1000}$ So powerful is the Tathāgata, so majestic and mighty is he in this world together with its devas." [34]

When, through direct knowledge, the Buddha, the teacher, the peerless person in this world with its devas, sets in motion the wheel of Dhamma, [he teaches] personal existence, its cessation, the origin of personal existence, and the noble eightfold path that leads to the calming down of suffering.

Then even those devas with long life spansbeautiful, ablaze with glorybecome fearful and filled with terror, like beasts who hear the lion's roar. "It seems that we are impermanent, not beyond personal existence," [they say], when they hear the word of the Arahant, the Stable One who is fully freed.

# 34 (4) Confidence

"Bhikkhus, there are these four foremost kinds of confidence. What four?

(1) "To whatever extent there are beings, whether footless or with two feet, four feet, or many feet, whether having form or formless, whether percipient or non-percipient, or neither percipient nor non-percipient, the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectiy Enlightened One is declared the foremost among them. Those who have confidence in the Buddha have confidence in the foremost, and for those who have confidence in the foremost, the result is foremost.
(2) "To whatever extent there are phenomena that are conditioned, the noble eightfold path is declared the foremost among them. Those who have confidence in the noble eightfold path have confidence in the foremost, and for those who have confidence in the foremost, the result is foremost.

(3) "To whatever extent there are phenomena conditioned or unconditioned, ${ }^{691}$ dispassion is declared the foremost among them, that is, the crushing of pride, the removal of thirst, the uprooting of attachment, the termination of the round, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, nibbāna. Those who have confidence in the Dhamma have confidence in the foremost, and for those who have confidence in the foremost, the result is foremost.

(4) "To whatever extent there are Sanghas or groups, the Sangha of the Tathāgata's disciples is declared the foremost among them, that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals-this Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world. [35] Those who have confidence in the Sangha have confidence in the foremost, and for those who have confidence in the foremost, the result is foremost.

"These are the four foremost kinds of confidence."

For those confident in regard to the foremost, knowing the foremost Dhamma, confident in the Buddha-the foremostunsurpassed, worthy of offerings;

for those confident in the foremost Dhamma, in the blissful peace of dispassion;

for those confident in the foremost Sangha, the unsurpassed field of merit;

for those giving gifts to the foremost, the foremost kind of merit increases: the foremost life span, beauty, and glory, good reputation, happiness, and strength.

The wise one who gives to the foremost, ${ }^{692}$ concentrated upon the foremost Dhamma,
having become a deva or a human being, rejoices, having attained the foremost.

# 35 (5) Vassakāra

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. Then the brahmin Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

"Master Gotama, we describe someone who possesses four qualities as a great man with great wisdom. What four? (1) Here, someone is highly learned in the various fields of learning. (2) He understands the meaning of various statements, so that he can say: 'This is the meaning of this statement; this is the meaning of that one.' (3) He has a good memory; he remembers and recollects what was done and said long ago. (4) He is skillful and diligent in attending to the diverse chores of a householder; he possesses sound judgment about them in order to carry out and arrange them properly. We describe someone who possesses these four qualities as a great man with great wisdom. If Master Gotama thinks what I say should be approved, let him approve it. If he thinks what I say should be rejected, let him reject it."

"I neither approve of your [statement], brahmin, nor do I reject it. [36] Rather, I describe one who possesses four [other] qualities as a great man with great wisdom. What four? (1) Here, he is practicing for the welfare and happiness of many people; he is one who has established many people in the noble method, that is, in the goodness of the Dhamma, in the wholesomeness of the Dhamma. ${ }^{293}$ (2) He thinks whatever he wants to think and does not think what he does not want to think; he intends whatever he wants to intend and does not intend what he does not want to intend; thus he has attained to mental mastery over the ways of thought. (3) He gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life. (4) With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.

"I neither approve of your [statement], brahmin, nor do I
reject it. But I describe someone who possesses these four qualities as a great man with great wisdom."

"It is astounding and amazing, Master Gotama, how well this has been stated by Master Gotama. And we consider Master Gotama as one who possesses these four qualities. (1) For he is practicing for the welfare and happiness of many people; he is one who has established many people in the noble method, that is, in the goodness of the Dhamma, in the wholesomeness of the Dhamma. (2) He thinks whatever he wants to think and does not think what he does not want to think; he intends whatever he wants to intend and does not intend what he does not want to intend; thus he has attained to mental mastery over the ways of thought. (3) He gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life. (4) With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it." [37]

"Surely, brahmin, your words are prying and intrusive. ${ }^{694}$ Nevertheless, I will answer you. (1) Indeed, I am practicing for the welfare and happiness of many people; I have established many people in the noble method, that is, in the goodness of the Dhamma, in the wholesomeness of the Dhamma. (2) I think what I want to think and do not think what I do not want to think; I intend what I want to intend and do not intend what I do not want to intend; thus I have attained to mental mastery over the ways of thought. (3) I gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life. (4) With the destruction of the taints, I have realized for myself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, I dwell in it."

He who found for the sake of all beings release from the snare of death;

who revealed the Dhamma, the method, for the benefit of devas and humans;

he in whom many people gain confidence when they see and listen to him;

the one skilled in the path and what is not the path,
the taintless one who accomplished his task; the Enlightened One bearing his final body is called "a great man of great wisdom."

# 36 (6) Doṇa

On one occasion the Blessed One was traveling along the highway between Ukkaṭthā and Setavya. The brahmin Doṇa was also traveling along the highway between Ukkaṭthā and Setavya. The brahmin Doṇa then saw the thousand-spoked wheels of the Blessed One's footprints, with their rims and hubs, complete in all respects, ${ }^{695}$ and thought: "It is astounding and amazing! These surely could not be the footprints of a human being!" [38]

Then the Blessed One left the highway and sat down at the foot of a tree, folding his legs crosswise, straightening his body, and establishing mindfulness in front of him. Tracking the Blessed One's footprints, the brahmin Doṇa saw the Blessed One sitting at the foot of the tree-graceful, inspiring confidence, with peaceful faculties and peaceful mind, one who had attained to the highest taming and serenity, [like] a tamed and guarded bull elephant with controlled faculties. He then approached the Blessed One and said to him:

(1) "Could you be a deva, sir?"696

"I will not be a deva, brahmin."

(2) "Could you be a gandhabba, sir?"697

"I will not be a gandhabba, brahmin."

(3) "Could you be a yakkha, sir?"

"I will not be a yakkha, brahmin."

(4) "Could you be a human being, sir?"

"I will not be a human being, brahmin."

"When you are asked: 'Could you be a deva, sir?' you say: 'I will not be a deva, brahmin.' When you are asked: 'Could you be a gandhabba, sir?' you say: 'I will not be a gandhabba, brahmin.' When you are asked: 'Could you be a yakkha, sir?' you say: 'I will not be a yakkha, brahmin.' When you are asked: 'Could you be a human being, sir?' you say: 'I will not be a human being, brahmin.' What, then, could you be, sir?"

(1) "Brahmin, I have abandoned those taints because of which I might have become a deva; I have cut them off at the root, made them like palm stumps, obliterated them so that they
are no longer subject to future arising. (2) I have abandoned those taints because of which I might have become a gandhabba... (3) . . . might have become a yakkha... (4) . . might have become a human being; I have cut them off at the root, made them like palm stumps, obliterated them so that they are no longer subject to future arising. Just as a blue, red, or white lotus flower, though born in the water and grown up in the water, rises above the water and stands [39] unsoiled by the water, even so, though born in the world and grown up in the world, I have overcome the world and dwell unsoiled by the world. Remember me, brahmin, as a Buddha.

"I have destroyed those taints by which

I might have been reborn as a deva

or as a gandhabba that travels through the sky;

by which I might have reached the state of a yakkha, or arrived back at the human state: ${ }^{698}$

I have dispelled and cut down these taints.

"As a lovely white lotus

is not soiled by the water,

I am not soiled by the world:

therefore, O brahmin, I am a Buddha." ${ }^{\prime 699}$

# 37 (7) Non-Decline

"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who possesses four qualities is incapable of decline and is in the vicinity of nibbāna. What four? Here, a bhikkhu is accomplished in virtuous behavior, guards the doors of the sense faculties, observes moderation in eating, and is intent on wakefulness.

(1) "And how is a bhikkhu accomplished in virtuous behavior? Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. It is in this way that a bhikkhu is accomplished in virtuous. behavior.

(2) "And how does a bhikkhu guard the doors of the sense faculties? Here, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu does not grasp its marks and features. Since, if he left the eye faculty unrestrained, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him, he practices restraint over it; he guards the
eye faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. Having heard a sound with the ear ... Having smelled an odor with the nose... Having tasted a taste with the tongue... Having felt a tactile object with the body... Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, a bhikkhu does not grasp its marks and features. Since, if he left the mind faculty unrestrained, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection [40] might invade him, he practices restraint over it; he guards the mind faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty. It is in this way that a bhikkhu guards the doors of the sense faculties.

(3) "And how does a bhikkhu observe moderation in eating? Here, reflecting carefully, a bhikkhu consumes food neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness, but only for the support and maintenance of this body, for avoiding harm, and for assisting the spiritual life, considering: 'Thus I shall terminate the old feeling and not arouse a new feeling, ${ }^{700}$ and 1 shall be healthy and blameless and dwell at ease.' It is in this way that a bhikkhu observes moderation in eating.

(4) "And how is a bhikkhu intent on wakefulness? Here, during the day, while walking back and forth and sitting, a bhikkhu purifies his mind of obstructive qualities. In the first watch of the night, while walking back and forth and sitting, he purifies his mind of obstructive qualities. In the middle watch of the night he lies down on the right side in the lion's posture, with one foot overlapping the other, mindful and clearly comprehending, after noting in his mind the idea of rising. After rising, in the last watch of the night, while walking back and forth and sitting, he purifies his mind of obstructive qualities. It is in this way that a bhikkhu is intent on wakefulness.

"A bhikkhu who possesses these four qualities is incapable of decline and is in the vicinity of nibbāna."

Established in virtuous behavior, restrained in the sense faculties, moderate in eating, intent on wakefulness:

a bhikkhu dwells thus ardently, unwearying by day and night,
developing wholesome qualities ${ }^{701}$ to attain security from bondage.

A bhikkhu who delights in heedfulness, seeing the dànger in heedlessness, is incapable of decline:

he is close to nibbāna. ${ }^{702}$ [41]

# 38 (8) Drawn Back

"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who has dispelled personal truths, totally renounced seeking, and tranquilized bodily activity is said to have drawn back. ${ }^{703}$

(1) "And how, bhikkhus, has a bhikkhu dispelled personal truths? ${ }^{704}$ Here, whatever ordinary personal truths may be held by ordinary ascetics and brahmins-that is, 'The world is eternal' or 'The world is not eternal'; 'The world is finite' or 'The world is infinite'; 'The soul and the body are the same' or 'The soul is one thing, the body another'; 'The Tathāgata exists after death,' or 'The Tathāgata does not exist after death,' or 'The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death,' or 'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death'--a bhikkhu has discarded and dispelled them all, given them up, rejected them, let go of them, abandoned and relinquished them. ${ }^{705}$ It is in this way that a bhikkhu has dispelled personal truths.

(2) "And how has a bhikkhu totally renounced seeking? Here, a bhikkhu has abandoned the search for sensual pleasures and the search for existence and has allayed the search for a spiritual life. ${ }^{706}$ It is in this way that a bhikkhu has totally renounced seeking.

(3) "And how has a bhikkhu tranquilized bodily activity? Here, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has tranquilized bodily activity. ${ }^{707}$

(4) "And how has a bhikkhu drawn back? Here, a bhikkhu has abandoned the conceit 'I am,' cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no longer subject to future arising. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has drawn back.

"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who has dispelled personal truths,
totally renounced seeking, and tranquilized bodily activity is said to have drawn back." [42]

Seeking for sense pleasures, seeking for existence, seeking for a spiritual life; the tight grasp "Such is the truth," viewpoints [that are] swellings: ${ }^{738}$

for one entirely detached from lust, liberated by the destruction of craving, such seeking has been relinquished, and viewpoints are uprooted.

That peaceful, mindful bhikkhu, tranquil, undefeated, enlightened by breaking through conceit; is called."one who has drawn back."

# 39 (9) Ujjaya

Then the brahmin Ujjaya approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

"Does Master Gotama praise sacrifice?"

"I do not praise all sacrifice, brahmin, nor do I withhold praise from all sacrifice. (1) I do not praise a violent sacrifice at which cattle, goats, rams, chickens, and pigs are slain, at which various creatures are led to slaughter. (2) For what reason? Because arahants and those who have entered the path to arahantship do not attend a violent sacrifice.

(3) "But I praise a nonviolent sacrifice at which cattle, goats, rams, chickens, and pigs are not slain, where various creatures are not slaughtered, that is, a regular giving, a sacrifice offered by family custom. ${ }^{799}$ (4) For what reason? Because arahants and those who have entered the path to arahantship attend a nonviolent sacrifice." ${ }^{\prime 710}$

The horse sacrifice, human sacrifice, sammāpāsa, vājapeyya, [43] niraggala: ${ }^{711}$
these grand sacrifices, fraught with violence, ${ }^{712}$ do not bring great fruit.

The great seers of right conduct do not attend a sacrifice where goats, rams, cattle, and various creatures are slain.

But when they regularly offer by family custom sacrifices free from violence, no goats, sheep, and cattle or various creatures are slain.

That is the sacrifice the great seers of right conduct attend.

The wise person should offer this; this sacrifice is very fruitful.

For one who makes such sacrifice it is indeed better, never worse.

Such a sacrifice is truly vast and the deities too are pleased.

40) (10) Udāyī

Then the brahmin Udāyī approached the Blessed One ... and said to him:

[The prose portion is identical with that of 4:39.]

When a sacrifice is timely and allowable, well prepared and nonviolent, [44] the self-controlled followers of the spiritual life attend such a sacrifice as this.

Those in the world who have removed the coverings, ${ }^{713}$ transcenders of time and destination, ${ }^{714}$ the Buddhas who are proficient in sacrifice, ${ }^{715}$ praise this kind of sacrifice.

Having prepared an appropriate gift, whether of the ordinary kind or in memory of the dead,
one makes the sacrifice with a confident mind to a fertile field, to followers of the spiritual life.

When what has been properly obtained is properly offered, properly sacrificed, to those worthy of offerings, the sacrifice is vast and the deities are pleased.

The wise person endowed with faith, having sacrificed thus with a generous mind, is reborn in a happy world, in [a realm] without affliction.

# V. ROHITASSA

41 (1) Concentration

"Bhikkhus, there are these four developments of concentration. What four? (1) There is a development of concentration that leads to dwelling happily in this very life. ${ }^{716}$ (2) There is a development of concentration that leads to obtaining knowledge and vision. (3) There is a development of concentration that leads to mindfulness and clear comprehension. (4) There is a development of concentration that leads to the destruction of the taints. [45]

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the development of concentration that leads to dwelling happily in this very life? Here, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. With the subsiding of thought and examination, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration, without thought and examination. With the fading away as well of rapture, he dwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, he experiences pleasure with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: 'He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.' With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, neither
painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity. This is called the development of concentration that leads to dwelling happily in this very life. ${ }^{717}$

(2) "And what is the development of concentration that leads to obtaining knowledge and vision? ${ }^{718}$ Here, a bhikkhu attends to the perception of light; he focuses on the perception of day thus: 'As by day, so at night; as at night, so by day. ${ }^{719}$ Thus, with a mind that is open and uncovered, he develops a mind imbued with luminosity. This is the development of concentration that leads to obtaining knowledge and vision.

(3) "And what is the development of concentration that leads to mindfulness and clear comprehension? Here, a bhikkhu knows feelings as they arise, as they remain present, as they disappear; he knows perceptions as they arise, as they remain present, as they disappear; he knows thoughts as they arise, as they remain present, as they disappear. ${ }^{720}$ This is the development of concentration that leads to mindfulness and clear comprehension.

(4) "And what is the development of concentration that leads to the destruction of the taints? Here, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating arising and vanishing in the five aggregates subject to clinging: 'Such is form, such its origin, such its passing away; such is feeling . . . such is perception . . . such are volitional activities . . .such is consciousness, such its origin, such its passing away.' This is the development of concentration that leads to the destruction of the taints.

"These are the four developments of concentration. And it was with reference to this that I said in the Pārāyana, in 'The Questions of Punṇaka':

"Having comprehended the world's highs and lows, he is not perturbed by anything in the world. [46] Peaceful, fumeless, untroubled, wishless, he has, I say, crossed over birth and old age."721

# 42 (2) Questions

"Bhikkhus, there are these four ways of answering questions. ${ }^{722}$ What four? (1) There is a question to be answered categorically; (2) there is a question to be answered after making a distinction; (3) there is a question to be answered with a counter-question;
and (4) there is a question to be set aside. These are the four ways of answering questions."

One kind is given a categorical answer, another is answered after making a distinction; to the third, one should raise a counter-question, but the fourth should be set aside.

When a bhikkhu knows how to answer each type in the appropriate way, they say that he is skilled in the four kinds of questions.

He is hard to attack, hard to defeat, deep, hard to assault; he is proficient in both what is beneficial and harmful.

The wise person avoids what is harmful, and takes up what is beneficial.

By arriving at what is beneficial, the steadfast one is said to be wise.

# 43 (3) Anger (1)

"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? (1) One who values anger, not the good Dhamma; (2) one who values denigration, not the good Dhamma; (3) one who values gain, not the good Dhamma; and (4) one who values honor, not the good Dhamma. These are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world.

"There are, bhikkhus, these four [other] kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? (1) One who values the good Dhamma, notanger; (2) one who values the good Dhamma, not denigration; (3) one who values the good Dhamma, not gain; (4) one who values the good Dhamma, not honor. [47] These are the [other] four kinds of persons found existing in the world."

Bhikkhus who value anger and denigration, who value gain and honor,
do not grow in the good Dhamma taught by the Perfectly Enlightened One.

But those who value the good Dhamma, who dwelled thus in the past and dwell thus now, truly grow in the Dhamma taught by the Perfectly Enlightened One.

44 (4) Anger (2)

"Bhikkhus, there are these four things contrary to the good Dhamma. What four? (1) Valuing anger, not the good Dhamma; (2) valuing denigration, not the good Dhamma; (3) valuing gain, not the good Dhamma; and (4) valuing honor, not the good Dhamma. These are four things contrary to the good Dhamma.

"There are, bhikkhus, these four [other] things in accord with the good Dhamma. What four? (1) Valuing the good Dhamma, not anger; (2) valuing the good Dhamma, not denigration; (3) valuing the good Dhamma, not gain; and (4) valuing the good Dhamma, not honor. These are the four [other] things in accord with the good Dhamma."

Bhikkhus who value anger and denigration, who value gain and honor, are like rotten seeds in a fertile field: they do not grow in the good Dhamma.

But those who value the good Dhamma, who dwelled thus in the past and dwell thus now, are like moistened medicinal plants:

they grow in the Dhamma.

45 (5) Rohitassa (1) ${ }^{733}$.

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Then, when the night had advanced, the young deva Rohitassa, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta's Grove, approached the Blessed One. He paid homage to the Blessed One, stood to one side, and said:

"Is it possible, Bhante, by traveling to know, see, or reach the end of the world, where one is not born, does not grow old and die, [48] does not pass away and get reborn?"
"I say, friend, that by traveling one cannot know, see, or reach that end of the world where one is not born, does not grow old and die, does not pass away and get reborn."

"It is astounding and amazing, Bhante, how well this was stated by the Blessed One: 'I say, friend, that by traveling one cannot know, see, or reach that end of the world where one is not born, does not grow old and die, does not pass away and get reborn.'

"In the past, Bhante, I was a seer named Rohitassa, son of Bhoja, one possessing psychic potency, able to travel through the sky. My speed was like that of a light arrow easily shot by a firm-bowed ${ }^{74}$ archer-one trained, skillful, and experienced ${ }^{75}$ across the shadow of a palmyra tree. My stride was such that it could reach from the eastern ocean to the western ocean.' Then, while I possessed such speed and such a stride, the wish arose in me: 'I will reach the end of the world by traveling.' Having a life span of a hundred years, living for a hundred years, I traveled for a hundred years without pausing except to eat, drink, chew, and taste, to defecate and urinate, and to dispel fatigue with sleep; yet I died along the way without having reached the end of the world.

"It is astounding and amazing, Bhante, how well this was stated by the Blessed One: 'I say, friend, that by traveling one cannot know, see, or reach that end of the world where one is not born, does not grow old and die, does not pass away and. get reborn."

"I say, friend, that by traveling one cannot know, see, or reach that end of the world where one is not born, does not grow old and die, does not pass away and get reborn: Yet I say that without having reached the end of the world there is no making an end of suffering. It is in this fathom-long body endowed with perception and mind that I proclaim (1) the world, (2) the origin of the world, (3) the cessation of the world, and (4) the way leading to the cessation of the world." [49]

The end of the world can never be reached by means of traveling [across the world]; yet without reaching the world's end there is no release from suffering.

Hence the wise one, the world-knower, who has reached the world's end and lived the spiritual life,

having known the world's end, at peace, does not desire this world or another.

46 (6) Rohitassa (2)

Then when that night had passed, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, last night, when the night had advanced, the young deva Rohitassa, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta's Grove, approached me, paid homage to me, stood to one side, and said:

"Is it possible, Bhante, by traveling to know, see, or reach the end of the world, where one is not born, does not grow old and die, does not pass away and get reborn?""

[What follows is identical with 4:45, including the verses, but spoken in the first-person narrative voice.] [50]

47 (7) Far Apart

"Bhikkhus, there are these four pairs of things extremely far apart. What four? (1) The sky and the earth. (2) The near and the far shores of the ocean. (3) The place where the sun rises and the place where it sets. (4) The teaching of the good and the teaching of the bad. These are the four pairs of things extremely far apart." [51]

The sky and the earth are far apart, the ocean's far shore is said to be far, and so the place where the sun rises from the place where it sets.

But even farther apart, they say, are the teachings of the good and the bad. ${ }^{726}$

The company of the good is constant;

so long as it endures, it is just the same.

But the company of the bad is fickle;

thus the teaching of the good

is far from the bad.

48 (8) Visākha ${ }^{737}$

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Now on that occasion the Venerable Visākha Pañcāliputta was instructing, exhorting, inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk, [spoken] with speech that was polished, clear, articulate, expressive of the meaning, comprehensive, and unhindered.

Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and approached the assembly hall. He sat down on the appointed seat and addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, who has been instructing; exhorting, inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk, [spoken] with speech that is polished, clear, articulate, expressive of the meaning, comprehensive, and unhindered?"

"It was Venerable Visākha Pañcāliputta, Bhante."

Then the Blessed One said to the Venerable Visākha Pañcāliputta: "Good, good, Visākha! It is good that you instruct, exhort, inspire, and gladden the bhikkhus in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk, [spoken] with speech that is polished, clear, articulate, expressive of the meaning, comprehensive, and unhindered."

When the wise man is in the midst of fools, they do not know him if he does not speak. ${ }^{728}$

But they know him when he speaks, teaching the deathless state.

He should speak and illustrate the Dhamma; he should lift high the seers' banner.

Well-spoken words are the seers' banner:

for the Dhamma is the banner of seers. [52]

# 49 (9) Inversions

"Bhikkhus, there are these four inversions of perception, inversions of mind, and inversions of view. ${ }^{729}$ What four? (1) The inversion of perception, mind, and view that takes the impermanent to be permanent; (2) the inversion of perception, mind, and view that takes what is suffering to be pleasurable; ${ }^{730}$ (3) the inversion of perception, mind, and view that takes what is
non-self to be self; (4) the inversion of perception, mind, and view that takes what is unattractive to be attractive. These are the four inversions of perception, mind, and view.

"There are, bhikkhus, these four non-inversions of perception, non-inversions of mind, and non-inversions of view. What four? (1) The non-inversion of perception, mind, and view that takes the impermanent to be impermanent; (2) the non-inversion of perception, mind, and view that takes what is suffering to be suffering; (3) the non-inversion of perception, mind, and view that takes what is non-self to be non-self; (4) the non-inversion of perception, mind, and view that takes what is unattractive to be unattractive. These are the four non-inversions of perception, mind, and view."

Perceiving permanence in the impermanent, perceiving pleasure in what is suffering, perceiving a self in what is non-self, and perceiving attractiveness in what is unattractive, beings resort to wrong views, ${ }^{731}$

their minds deranged, their perception twisted.

Such people are bound by the yoke of Māra, and do not reach security from bondage.

Beings continue in samsāra, going to birth and death.

But when the Buddhas arise in the world, sending forth a brilliant light, they reveal this Dhamma that leads to the stilling of suffering.

Having heard it, wise people have regained their sanity.

They have seen the impermanent as impermanent and what is suffering as suffering.

They have seen what is non-self as non-self and the unattractive as unattractive.

By the acquisition of right view, they have overcome all suffering. [53]

50 (10) Defilements

"Bhikkhus, there are these four defilements of the sun and moon because of which the sun and moon do not shine, blaze, and radiate. What four? Clouds are a defilement of the sun and moon because of which the sun and moon do not shine, blaze, and radiate; fog is a defilement of the sun and moon ${ }^{732} \ldots$ smoke and dust is a defilement of the sun and moon . . . and Rāhu, lord of the asuras, is a defilement of the sun and moon because of which the sun and moon do not shine, blaze, and radiate. These are the four defilements of the sun and moon because of which the sun and moon do not shine, blaze, and radiate.

"So too, bhikkhus, there are four defilements of ascetics and brahmins because of which some ascetics and brahmins do not shine, blaze, and radiate. What four?

(1) "There are some ascetics and brahmins who drink liquor and wine and do not refrain from drinking liquor and wine. This is the first defilement of ascetics and brahmins because of which some ascetics and brahmins do not shine, blaze, and radiate.

(2) "There are some ascetics and brahmins who indulge in sexual intercourse and do not refrain from sexual intercourse. This is the second defilement of ascetics and brahmins because of which some ascetics and brahmins do not shine, blaze, and radiate.

(3) "There are some ascetics and brahmins who accept gold and silver and do not refrain from receiving gold and silver. This is the third defilement of ascetics and brahmins because of which some ascetics and brahmins do not shine, blaze, and radiate.

(4) "There are some ascetics and brahmins who earn their living by wrong livelihood and do not refrain from wrong livelihood. This is the fourth defilement of ascetics and brahmins because of which some ascetics and brahmins do not shine, blaze, and radiate.

"These are the four defilements of ascetics and brahmins [54] because of which some ascetics and brahmins do not shine; blaze, and radiate. ${ }^{\prime \prime 733}$

Some ascetics and brahmins

are dragged around by lust and hatred;
men hindered by ignorance seek delight in pleasant things.

They drink liquor and wines, indulge in sexual activity; the ignorant accept silver and gold.

Some ascetics and brahmins live by wrong livelihood. These are the defilements that the Buddha, Kinsman of the Sun, described.

Defiled by these, some ascetics and brahminsimpure, dusty creatures- ${ }^{234}$ do not shine and blaze.

Shrouded in darkness, slaves of craving, led along, they take renewed existence and fill the terrible charnel ground.

# The Second Fifty

## 1. Streams of Merit

51 (1) Streams of Merit (1)

"Bhikkhus, there are these four streams of merit, streams of the wholesome, nutriments of happiness-heavenly, ripening in happiness, conducive to heaven-that lead to what is wished for, desired, and agreeable,'to one's welfare and happiness. What four? ${ }^{235}$

"(1) When a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a measureless concentration of mind ${ }^{236}$ while using a robe [that one has given him], one acquires a measureless stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, a nutriment of happiness ... that leads ... to one's welfare and happiness. (2) When a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a measureless concentration of mind while using almsfood [that
one has given him], one acquires a measureless stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, a nutriment of happiness... that leads... to one's welfare and happiness. [55] (3) When a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a measureless concentration of mind while using a lodging [that one has given him], one acquires a measureless stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, a nutriment of happiness . . . that leads . . . to one's welfare and happiness. (4) When a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a measureless concentration of mind while using medicines and provisions for the sick [that one has given him], one acquires a measureless stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, a nutriment of happiness . . . that leads to one's welfare and happiness.

"These are the four streams of merit, streams of the wholesome, nutriments of happiness-heavenly, ripening in happiness, conducive to heaven-that lead to what is wished for, desired, and agreeable, to one's welfare and happiness.

"When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple possesses these four streams of merit, streams of the wholesome, it is not easy to measure his merit thus: 'Just so much is his stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, nutriment of happiness ... that leads to . . . one's welfare and happiness'; rather, it is reckoned simply as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit.

"Bhikkhus, just as it is not easy to measure the water in the great ocean thus: 'There are so many gallons of water,' or 'There are so many hundreds of gallons of water,' or 'There are so many thousands of gallons of water,' or 'There are so many hundreds of thousands of gallons of water,' but rather it is reckoned simply as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of water; só too, when a noble disciple possesses these four streams of merit . . . it is reckoned simply as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit."

Just as the many rivers used by the hosts of people, flowing downstream, reach the ocean, the great mass of water, the boundless sea, the fearsome receptacle of heaps of gems; [56] so the streams of merit reach the wise man who is a giver of food, drink, and cloth; [they reach] the donor of beds, seats, and covers like rivers carrying their waters to the sea.

52 (2) Streams of Merit (2) ${ }^{737}$

"Bhikkhus, there are these four streams of merit, streams of the wholesome, nutriments of happiness-heavenly, ripening in happiness, conducive to heaven-that lead to what is wished for, desired, and agreeable, to one's welfare and happiness. What four?

(1) "Here, a noble disciple possesses unwavering confidence in the Buddha thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' This is the first stream of merit....

(2) "Again, a noble disciple possesses unwavering confidence in the Dhamma thus: 'The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.' This is the second stream of merit....

(3) "Again, a noble disciple possesses unwavering confidence in the Sangha thus: 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is practicing the good way, practicing the straight way, practicing the true way, practicing the proper way; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals-this Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.' This is the third stream of merit....

(4) "Again, a noble disciple possesses the virtuous behavior loved by the noble ones, unbroken, flawless, unblemished, [57] unblotched, freeing, praised by the wise, ungfasped, leading to concentration. This is the fourth stream of merit....

"These are the four strefams of merit, streams of the wholesome, nutriments of happiness-heavenly, ripening in happiness, conducive to heaven-that lead to what is wished for, desired, and agreeable, to one's welfare and happiness."

When one has faith in the Tathāgata, unshakable and well-established, and virtuous behavior that is good, loved by the noble ones and praised; when one has confidence in the Sangha
and one's view has been straightened out, they say that one is not poor, that one's life is not lived in vain.

Therefore an intelligent person, remembering the Buddhas' teaching, should be intent on faith and virtuous behavior, confidence and vision of the Dhamma. ${ }^{338}$

# 53 (3) Living Together (1)

On one occasion the Blessed One was traveling along the highway between Madhurā and Verañjā. A number of male and female householders were also traveling along the same highway. Then the Blessed One left the highway and sat down at the foot of a tree. The male and female householders saw the Blessed One sitting there and approached him, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to them:

"Householders, there are these four ways of living together. What four? A wretch lives together with a wretch; ${ }^{339}$ a wretch lives together with a female deva; a deva lives together with a wretch; a deva lives together with a female deva.

(1). "And how, householders, does a wretch live together with a wretch? [58] Here, the husband is one who destroys life, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, speaks falsely, and indulges in liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness; he is immoral, of bad character; he dwells at home with a heart obsessed by the stain of miserliness; he insults and reviles ascetics and brahmins. And his wife is also one who destroys life . . . she insults and reviles ascetics and brahmins. It is in such a way that a wretch lives together with a wretch.

(2) "And how does a wretch live together with a female deva? Here, the husband is one who destroys life . . . he insults and reviles ascetics and brahmins. But his wife is one who abstains from the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness; she is virtuous, of good character; she dwells at home with a heart free from the stain of miserliness; she does not insult or revile ascetics and
brahmins. It is in such a way that a wretch lives together with a female deva.

(3) "And how does a deva live together with a wretch? Here, the husband is one who abstains from the destruction of life . . . he does not insult or revile ascetics and brahmins. But his wife is one who destroys life . . . she insults and reviles ascetics and brahmins. It is in such a way that a deva lives together with a wretch.

(4) "And how does a deva live together with a female deva? Here, the husband is one who abstains from the destruction of life . . . he does not insult or revile ascetics and brahmins. And his wife is also one who abstains from the destruction of life . . . she does not insult or revile ascetics and brahmins. It is in such a way that a deva lives together with a female deva. [59]

"These are the four ways of living together."

When both are immoral, miserly and abusive, husband and wife

live together as wretches.

The husband is immoral, miserly and abusive, but his wife is virtuous, charitable, generous.

She is a female deva living with a wretched husband.

The husband is virtuous, charitable, generous, but his wife is immoral, miserly and abusive. She is a wretch living with a deva husband.

Both husband and wife are endowed with faith, charitable and self-controlled, living their lives righteously, addressing each other with pleasant words.

Then many benefits accrue to them and they dwell at ease.

Their enemies are saddened when both are the same in virtue.

Having practiced the Dhamma here, the same in virtuous behavior and observances, delighting [after death] in a deva world, they rejoice; enjoying sensual pleasures.

# 54 (4) Living Together (2)

"Bhikkhus, there are these four ways of living together. What four? A wretch lives together with a wretch; a wretch lives together with a female deva; a deva lives together with a wretch; a deva lives together with a female deva.

[The rest, including the verses, is identical with 4:53 but addressed to the bhikkhus.] [60-61]

## 55 (5) The Same in Living (1)

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Bhaggas in Sumsumāragira in the deer park at Bhesakalā Grove. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and went to the residence of the householder Nakulapitā, where he sat down in the prepared seat. Then the householder Nakulapitā and the housewife Nakulamātā approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. ${ }^{740}$ The householder Nakulapitā then said to the Blessed One:

"Bhante, since I was young, when the young girl Nakulamātā was given to me in marriage, I do not recall ever transgressing against her even in thought, much less by deed. We wish, Bhante, to see one another not only in this present life but also in future lives."

The housewife Nakulamātā in turn said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, since I was a young girl given to the young householder Nakulapitā in marriage, I do not recall ever transgressing against him even in thought, much less by deed. We wish, Bhante, to see one another not only in this present life but also in future lives." [62]

"Householders, if both husband and wife wish to see one
another not only in this present life but also in future lives, they should have the same faith, the same virtuous behavior, the same generosity, and the same wisdom. Then they will see one another not only in this present life but also in future lives."

Both husband and wife are endowed with faith, charitable and self-controlled, living their lives righteously, addressing each other with pleasant words,

Then many benefits accrue to them and they dwell at ease.

Their enemies are saddened when both are the same in virtue.

Having practiced the Dhamina here, the same in virtuous behavior and observances, delighting [after death] in a deva world, they rejoice, enjoying sensual pleasures.

56 (6) The Same in Living (2)

"Bhikkhus, if both husband and wife wish to behold one another not only in this present life but also in future lives, they should have the same faith, the same virtuous behavior, the same generosity, and the same wisdom. Then they will behold one another not only in this present life but also in future lives."

[The verses are identical with those of 4:55.]

57 (7) Suppaväsā

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Koliyans near the Koliyan town named Sajjanela. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and went to the residence of the Koliyan daughter Suppavāsā, where he sat down in the prepared seat. ${ }^{741}$ Then the Koliyan daughter Suppavāsā, [63] with her own hand, served and satisfied the Blessed One with various kinds of delicious food. When the Blessed One had finished eating and had put away his bowl, the Koliyan daughter Suppavāsā sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to her:
"Suppavāsā, a female noble disciple who gives food gives the recipients four things. What four? She gives life, beauty, happiness, and strength. (1) Having given life, she partakes of life, whether celestial or human. (2) Having given beauty, she partakes of beauty, whether celestial or human. (3) Having given happiness, she partakes of happiness, whether celestial or human. (4) Having given strength, she partakes of strength, whether celestial or human. Suppavāsā, a female noble disciple who gives food gives the recipients these four things."

When one gives well-prepared food, pure, delicious, and flavorful, to the upright ones who are exalted and of excellent conduct, that offering, which links merit with merit, is praised as very fruitful by the world-knowers. ${ }^{792}$

Those recollecting such generosity dwell in the world inspired by joy.

Having removed the stain of miserliness and its root, blameless, they go to the heavenly abode.

# 58 (8) Sudatta

Then the householder Anāthapindika approached the Blessed One. . . The Blessed One then said to him:

"Householder, a noble disciple who gives food gives the recipients four things. What four? [64] He gives life, beauty, happiness, and strength. (1) Having given life, he partakes of life, whether celestial or human. (2) Having given beauty, he partakes of beauty, whether celestial or human. (3) Having given happiness, he partakes of happiness, whether celestial or human. (4) Having given strength, he partakes of strength, whether celestial or human. Householder, a noble disciple who gives food gives the recipients these four things."

One who respectfully gives timely food to those self-controlled ones who eat what others give, provides them with four things:

life, beauty, happiness, and strength.

The man who gives life and beauty, who gives happiness and strength, will obtain long life and fame wherever he is reborn.

59 (9) Food

"Bhikkhus, when a donor gives food, he gives the recipients four things. What four? ... [as in preceding sutta]... Bhikkhus, when a donor gives food, he gives the recipients these four things."

[The verses are identical with those of 4:58.] [65]

60 (10) The Layperson's Proper Practice

Then the householder Anāthapindika approached the Blessed One. . . The Blessed One said to him:

"Householder, a noble disciple who possesses four qualities is practicing the way proper to the layperson, a way that brings the attainment of fame and leads to heaven. What four?

"Here, householder, a noble disciple serves the Sangha of bhikkhus with robes; he serves the Sangha of bhikkhus with almsfood; he serves the Sangha of bhikkhus with lodgings; he serves the Sangha of bhikkhus with medicines and provisions for the sick. ${ }^{33}$

"Householder, a noble disciple who possesses these four qualities is practicing the way proper to the layperson, a way that brings the attainment of fame and leads to heaven."

When the wise practice the way proper for the layperson, they serve the virtuous monks of upright conduct with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines:

for them both by day and night merit always increases;

having done excellent deeds, they pass on to a heavenly state.

# II. WORTHY DEEDS

61 (1) Worthy Deeds

Then the householder Anāthapindika approached the Blessed One. . . The Blessed One said to him: [66]

"Householder, there are these four things that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world. What four?

(1) "One thinks: 'May wealth come to me righteously!' This is the first thing in the world that is wished for... and rarely gained in the world.

(2) "Having gained wealth righteously, one thinks: 'May fame come to me and to my relatives and preceptors! ${ }^{1744}$ This is the second thing ... rarely gained in the world.

(3) "Having gained wealth righteously and having gained fame for oneself and for one's relatives and preceptors, one thinks: 'May I live long and enjoy a long life span!' This is the third thing . . . rarely gained in the world.

(4) "Having gained wealth righteously, having gained fame for oneself and for one's relatives and preceptors, living long and enjoying a long life span, one thinks: 'With the breakup of the body, after death, may I be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world!' This is the fourth thing ... rarely gained in the world.

"These are the four things that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world.

"There are, householder, four [other] things that lead to obtaining those four things. What four? Accomplishment in faith, accomplishment in virtuous behavior, accomplishment in generousity, and accomplishment in wisdom.

(1) "And what, householder, is accomplishment in faith? Here, a noble disciple is endowed with faith; he places faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' This is called accomplishment in faith.

(2) "And what is accomplishment in virtuous behavior? Here, a noble disciple abstains from the destruction of life . . . abstains
from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. This is called accomplishment in virtuous behavior.

(3) "And what is accomplishment in generosity? Here, a noble disciple dwells at home with a mind free from the stain of miserliness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in relinquishment, devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing. This is called accomplishment in generosity.

(4) "And what is accomplishment in wisdom? [67] If one dwells with a heart overcome by longing and unrighteous greed, one does what should be avoided and neglects one's duty, so that one's fame and happiness are spoiled. If one dwells with a heart overcome by ill will ... by dullness and drowsiness . . . by restlessness and remorse . . . by doubt, one does what should be avoided and neglects one's duty, so that one's fame and happiness are spoiled.

"When, householder, a noble disciple has understood thus: 'Longing and unrighteous greed are a defilement of the mind,' he abandons them. When he has understood thus: 'Ill will is a defilement of the mind,' he abandons it. When he has understood thus: 'Dullness and drowsiness are a defilement of the mind,' he abandons them. When he has understood thus: 'Restlessness and remorse are a defilement of the mind,' he abandons them. When he has understood thus: 'Doubt is a defilement of the mind,' he abandons it.

"When, householder, a noble disciple has understood thus. 'Longing and unrighteous greed are a defilement of the mind' and has abandoned them; when he has understood thus: 'Ill will . . . Dullness and drowsiness . . . Restlessness and remorse . . . Doubt is a defilement of the mind,' and has abandoned it, he is then called a noble disciple of great wisdom, of wide wisdom, one who sees the range, ${ }^{745}$ one accomplished in wisdom. This is called accomplishment in wisdom.

"These are the four [other] things that lead to obtaining the four things that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world.

"With wealth acquired by energétic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained, the noble disciple undertakes four worthy deeds. What four?

(1) "Here, householder, with wealth acquired by energetic
striving...righteously gained, the noble disciple makes himself happy and pleased and properly maintains himself in happiness; he makes his parents happy and pleased and properly maintains them in happiness; he makes his wife and children, his slaves, workers, and servants happy and pleased and properly maintains them in happiness; he makes his friends and companions happy and pleased and properly maintains them in happiness. This is the first case of wealth that has gone to good use, that has been properly utilized and used for a worthy cause. [68]

(2) "Again, with wealth acquired by energetic striving . . . righteously gained, the noble disciple makes provisions against the losses that might arise from fire, floods, kings, thieves, or displeasing heirs; he makes himself secure against them: This is the second case of wealth that has gone to good use ... for a worthy cause.

(3) "Again, with wealth acquired by energetic striving . . . righteously gained, the noble disciple makes the five oblations: to relatives, guests, ancestors, the king, and the deities. This is the third case of wealth that has gone to good use ... for a worthy cause.

(4) "Again, with wealth acquired by energetic striving . . . righteously gained, the noble disciple establishes an uplifting offering of alms-an offering that is heavenly, ${ }^{746}$ resulting in happiness, conducive to heaven-to those ascetics and brahmins who refrain from intoxication and heedlessness, who are settled in patience and mildness, who tame themselves, calm themselves, and train themselves for nibbāna. This is the fourth case of wealth that has gone to good use, that has been properly employed and used for a worthy cause.

"These, householder, are the four worthy deeds that the noble disciple undertakes with wealth acquired by energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained. When anyone exhausts wealth on anything apart from these four worthy deeds, that wealth is said to have gone to waste, to have been squandered, to have been used frivolously. But when anyone exhausts wealth on these four worthy deeds, that wealth is said to have gone to good use, to have been properly used, to have been utilized for a worthy cause."
"I've enjoyed wealth, supported my dependents, and overcome adversities. I have given an uplifting offering and performed the five oblations. I have served the virtuous monks, the self-controlled celibate ones. ${ }^{747}$

"I have achieved whatever purpose a wise person, dwelling at home, [69] might have in desiring wealth; what I have done brings me no regret."

Recollecting this, a'mortal remains firm in the noble Dhamma.

They praise him here in this life, and after death he rejoices in heaven.

# 62 (2) Freedom from Debt

Then the householder Anāthapindika approached the Blessed One. . . The Blessed One said to him:

"Householder, there are these four kinds of happiness that may be achieved by a layperson who enjoys sensual pleasures, depending on time and occasion. What four? The happiness of ownership, the happiness of enjoyment, the happiness of freedom from debt, and the happiness of blamelessness. ${ }^{748}$

(1) "And what, householder, is the happiness of ownership? Here, a clansman has acquired wealth by energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained. When he thinks, 'I have acquired wealth by energetic striving...righteously gained,' he experiences happiness and joy. This is called the happiness of ownership.

(2) "And what is the happiness of enjoyment? Here, with wealth acquired by energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained, a clansman enjoys his wealth and does meritorious deeds. When he thinks, With wealth acquired by energetic striving . . . righteously gained, I enjoy my wealth and do meritorious deeds,' he experiences happiness and joy. This is called the happiness of enjoyment.
(3) "And what is the happiness of freedom from debt? Here, a clansman has no debts to anyone, whether large or small. When he thinks, 'I have no debts to anyone, whether large or small,' he experiences happiness and joy. This is called the happiness of freedom from debt.

(4) "And what is the happiness of blamelessness? Here, householder, a noble disciple is endowed with blameless bodily, verbal, and mental action. [70] When he thinks, 'I am endowed with blameless bodily, verbal, and mental action,' he experiences happiness and joy. This is called the happiness of blamelessness.

"These are the four kinds of happiness that a layperson who enjoys sensual pleasures may achieve, depending on time and occasion."

Having known the happiness of freedom from debt, one should recall ${ }^{749}$ the happiness of ownership.

Enjoying the happiness of enjoyment, a mortal then sees things clearly with wisdom.

While seeing things clearly, the wise one knows both kinds ${ }^{750}$ of happiness.

The other is not worth a sixteenth part of the bliss of blamelessness. ${ }^{751}$

63 (3) With Brahm $\bar{a}^{752}$

(1) "Bhikkhus, those families dwell with Brahmā where at home the mother and father are revered by their children. (2) Those families dwell with the first teachers where at home the mother and father are revered by their children. (3) Those families dwell with the first deities where at home the mother and father are revered by their children. (4) Those families dwell with the gift-worthy where at home the mother and father are revered by their children.

"Brahmā,' bhikkhus, is a designation for mother and father. 'First teachers' is a designation for mother and father. 'First deities' is a designation for mother and father. 'Gift-worthy' is a designation for mother and father: And why? Mother and father are very helpful to their children: they raise them, nurture them, and show them the world."

Mother and father are called "Brahmā," and also "first teachers."

They are worthy of gifts from their children, for they have compassion for their offspring. Therefore a wise person should revere them and treat them with honor.

One should serve them with food and drink, with clothes and bedding, by massaging and bathing them, and by washing their feet.

Because of that service to mother and father, the wise praise one in this world and after death one rejoices in heaven. [71]

64 (4) Hell ${ }^{753}$

"Bhikkhus, one who possesses four qualities is cast into hell as if brought there. What four? He destroys life, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, and speaks falsely. One who possesses these four qualities is cast into hell as if brought there."

The destruction of life, taking what is not given, the uttering of false speech, and consorting with others' wives: the wise do not praise such deeds.

65 (5) Form

"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? (1) One who judges on the basis of form, whose confidence is based on form. (2) One who judges on the basis of speech, whose confidence is based on speech. (3) One who judges on the basis of austerity, whose confidence is based on austerity. (4) One who judges on the basis of the Dhamma, whose confidence is based on the Dhamma. These are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world."754

Those who judge on the basis of form and those who follow because of speech have come under the control of desire and lust; those people do not understand. ${ }^{755}$

One who does not know the inside and does not see the outside, a fool obstructed on all sides, is carried away by speech.

One who does not know the inside yet who clearly sees the outside, seeing the fruit externally, is also carried away by speech.

But one who understands the inside and who clearly sees the outside, seeing without hindrances, is not carried away by speech.

66 (6) Lustful

"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? The lustful, the hating, the deluded, and the conceited. These are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world." [72]

Beings enamored of tantalizing things, seeking delight in whatever is pleasing, low beings bound by delusion, ${ }^{756}$ increase their bondage.

The ignorant go about creating unwholesome kamma born of lust, hatred, and delusion: distressful deeds productive of suffering.

People hindered by ignorance, blind, lacking eyes to see, in accordance with their own nature, do not think of it in such a way. ${ }^{757}$

67 (7) Snakes

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Now on that occasion, in Sāvatthī, a certain bhikkhu had been bitten by a snake and had died. ${ }^{758}$ Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: "Bhante, a certain bhikkhu here in Sāvatthī was bitten by a snake and died."

[The Blessed One said:] "Surely, bhikkhus, that bhikkhu did not pervade the four royal families of snakes ${ }^{759}$ with a mind of loving-kindness. For if he had done so, he would not have been bitten by a snake and died. What are the four? The virūpakkha royal family of snakes, the erāpatha royal family of snakes, the chabyäputta royal family of snakes, and the black gotamaka royal family of snakes. Surely, that bhikkhu did not pervade these four royal families of snakes with a mind of loving-kindness. For if he had done so, he would not have been bitten by a snake and died.

"I enjoin you, bhikkhus, to pervade these four royal families of snakes with a mind of loving-kindness, for your own security, safety, and protection."

I have loving-kindness for the virūpakkha snakes; for the erāpatha snakes I have loving-kindness. I have loving-kindness for the chabyäputta snakes; for the black gotamakas I have loving-kindness.

I have loving-kindness for footless creatures; for those with two feet I have loving-kindness. [73] I have loving-kindness for those with four feet; for those with many feet I have loving-kindness.

May footless beings not harm me; may no harm come to me from those with two feet; may four-footed beings not harm me; may no harm come to me from those with many feet.

May all beings, all living things, all creatures, every one, meet with good fortune; may nothing bad come to anyone.

The Buddha is measureless, the Dhamma is measureless, the Sangha is measureless; creeping things, snakes, scorpions, centipedes, spiders, lizards, and rats are finite. I have made a safeguard, I have made protection. Let the creatures retreat. I pay homage to the Blessed One, homage to the seven Perfectly Enlightened Ones. ${ }^{760}$

# 68 (8) Devadatta

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak soon after Devadatta had left. ${ }^{761}$ There the Blessed One, with reference to Devadatta, addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, Devadatta's gain, honor, and praise led to his own ruin and destruction. (1) Just as a plantain tree yields fruit to its own ruin and destruction, so Devadatta's gain, honor, and praise led to his own ruin and destruction. (2) Just as a bamboo yields fruit to its own ruin and destruction, so Devadatta's gain, honor, and praise led to his own ruin and destruction. (3) Just as a reed yields fruit to its own ruin and destruction, so Devadatta's gain, honor, and praise led to his own ruin and destruction. (4) Just as a mule becomes pregnant to its own ruin and destruction, so Devadatta's gain, honor, and praise led to his own ruin and destruction."

As its own fruit destroys the plantain, as its fruit destroys the bamboo and reed, as its embryo destroys the mule, so does honor destroy the vile man. [74]

## 69 (9) Striving

"Bhikkhus, there are these four strivings. What four? Striving by restraint, striving by abandonment, striving by development, and striving by protection.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is striving by restraint? Here, a bhikkhu generates desire for the non-arising of unarisen bad unwholesome qualities; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. This is called striving by restraint.

(2) "And what is striving by abandonment? Here, a bhikkhu generates desire for the abandoning of arisen bad unwholesome qualities; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. This is called striving by abandonment.
(3) "And what is striving by development? Here, a bhikkhu generates desire for the arising of unarisen wholesome qualities; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. This is called striving by development.

(4) "And what is striving by protection? Here, a bhikkhu generates desire for the maintenance of arisen wholesome qualities, for their non-decline, increase, expansion, and fulfillment by development; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. This is called striving by protection.

"These are the four strivings."

Restraint and abandonment, development and protection:

by means of these four strivings taught by the Kinsman of the Sun a bhikkhu who is ardent here can attain the destruction of suffering.

"Bhikkhus, when kings are unrighteous, ${ }^{763}$ the royal vassals become unrighteous. When the royal vassals are unrighteous, brahmins and householders become unrighteous. ${ }^{764}$ When brahmins and householders are unrighteous, the people of the towns and countryside become unrighteous. When the people of the towns and countryside are unrighteous, the sun and moon [75] proceed off course. When the sun and moon proceed off course, the constellations and the stars proceed off course. When the constellations and the stars proceed off course, day and night proceed off course ... the months and fortnights proceed off course ... the seasons and years proceed off course. When the seasons and years proceed off course, the winds blow off course and at random. When the winds blow off course and at random, the deities become upset. When the deities are upset, sufficient rain does not fall. When sufficient rain does not fall, the crops ripen irregularly. When people eat crops that ripen irregularly, they become short-lived, ugly, weak, and sickly. ${ }^{765}$

if the chief bull goes crookedly, all the others go crookedly because their leader has gone crookedly.

So too, among human beings, when the one considered the chief behaves unrighteously, other people do so as well. [76] The entire kingdom is dejected if the king is unrighteous.

not asked about them, how much more then when asked. But when he is asked about them, then, led on by questions, he speaks about his own virtues without gaps and omissions, fully and in detail. It can be understood: 'This fellow is a bad person.'

"One who possesses these four qualities can be understood to be a bad person.

"Bhikkhus, one who possesses [another] four qualities can be understood to be a good person. What four?

(1) "Here, bhikkhus, a good person does not disclose the faults of others even when asked about them, how much less then when not asked.

"Bhikkhus, ${ }^{768}$ when a bride is first brought into the home, whether at night or during the day, at first she sets up a keen sense of moral shame and moral dread toward her mother-in-law, her father-in-law, her husband, and even the slaves, workers, and servants. But after some time, as a result of living together and intimacy with them, she says to her mother-in-
law, her father-in-law, and her husband: 'Go away! What do you know?'

"So too, when some bhikkhu here has gone forth from the household life into homelessness, whether by night or during the day, at first he sets up a keen sense of moral shame and moral dread toward the bhikkhus, the bhikkhunis, the male lay followers, the female lay followers, and even toward the monastery workers and novices. But after some time, as a result of living-together and intimacy with them, he says even to his teacher and his preceptor: 'Go away! What do you know?'

"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will dwell with a mind like that of a newly arrived bride.' It is in such a way that you should train yourselves." [79]

# 74 (4) Foremost (1)

"Bhikkhus, there are these four things that are foremost. What four? The foremost kind of virtuous behavior, the foremost kind of concentration, the foremost kind of wisdom, and the foremost kind of liberation. These are the four things that are foremost."

## 75 (5) Foremost (2)

"Bhikkhus, there are these four things that are foremost. What four? The foremost of forms, the foremost of feelings, the foremost of perceptions, and the foremost among states of existence. These are the four things that are foremost."769

## 76 (6) Kusinärā

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kusinārā between the twirrsal trees in the sal-tree grove of the Mallas at Upavattana, on the occasion of his final nibbāna. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, it may be that even a single bhikkhu has some doubt or uncertainty about the Buddha, the Dhamma, or the Sangha, about threpath or the practice. ${ }^{770}$ Then ask, bhikkhus. Do not be remorseful later, thinking: 'Our teacher was present before us, yetwe could not bring ourselves to question the Blessed One when we were in his presence.'

When this was said, the bhikkhus were silent. A second time... A third time the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus... And a third time the bhikkhus were silent.

Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "It may be the case, bhikkhus, that you do not ask out of respect for the teacher. Then report your questions to a friend." When this was said, the bhikkhus were still silent. [80]

Then the Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: "It is astounding and amazing, Bhante! I am confident that there is not a single bhikkhu in this Sangha who has any doubt or uncertainty about the Buddha, the Dhamma, or the Sangha, about the path or the practice."

"You speak out of confidence, Ānanda, but the Tathāgata knows this for a fact. For among these five hundred bhikkhus, even the least is a stream-enterer, no longer subject to [rebirth in] the lower world, fixed in destiny, heading for enlightenment."

# 77 (7) Inconceivable Matters

"Bhikkhus, there are these four inconceivable matters ${ }^{771}$ that one should not try to conceive; one who tries to conceive them would reap either madness or frustration. What four? (1) The domain of the Buddhas is an inconceivable matter that one should not try to conceive; one who tries to conceive it would reap either madness or frustration. (2) The domain of one in jhāna is an inconceivable matter...(3) The result of kamma is an inconceivable matter...(4) Speculation about the world is an inconceivable matter that one should not try to conceive; one who tries to conceive it would reap either madness or frustration. ${ }^{772}$ These are the four inconceivable matters that one should not try to conceive; one who tries to conceive them would reap either madness or frustration."

## 78 (8) Offerings

"Bhikkhus, there are these four purifications of offerings. ${ }^{773}$ What four? (1) There is an offering that is purified through the donor but not through the recipients; (2) there is an offering that is purified through the recipients but not through the donor; (3) there is an offering that is not purified through either the donor or the recipients; (4) there is an offering that is purified through both the donor and the recipients. [81]
(1) "And how, bhikkhus, is an offering purified through the donor but not through the recipients? Here, the donor is virtuous and of good character, but the recipients are immoral and of bad character. It is in this way that an offering is purified through the donor but not through the recipients.

(2) "And how is an offering purified through the recipients but not through the donor? Here, the donor is immoral and of bad character, but the recipients are virtuous and of good character. It is in this way that an offering is purified through the recipients but not through the donor.

(3) "And how is an offering not purified through either the donor or the recipients? Here, the donor is immoral and of bad character, and the recipients too are immoral and of bad character. It is in this way that an offering is not purified through either the donor or the recipients.

(4) "And how is an offering purified through both the donor and the recipients? Here, the donor is virtuous and of good character, and the recipients too are virtuous and of good character. It is in this way that an offering is purified through both the donor and the recipients.

"These are the four purifications of offerings."

# 79 (9) Business

Then the Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: "Bhante, (1) why is it that for one person here, the business he undertakes ends in failure? (2) Why is it that for another the same kind of business does not fulfill his expectations? (3) Why is it that for still another the same kind of business fulfills his expectations? (4) And why is it that for still another the same kind of business surpasses his expectations?"

(1) "Here, Sāriputta, someone approaches an ascetic or a brahmin and invites him to ask for what he needs, [82] but does not give him what was requested. When he passes away from there, if he comes back to this world, whatever business he undertakes ends in failure.

(2) "Someone else approaches an ascetic or a brahmin and invites him to ask for what he needs. He gives it to him but does not fulfill his expectations. When he passes away from there, if he comes back to this world, whatever business he undertakes does not fulfill his expectations.
(3) "Someone else approaches an ascetic or a brahmin and invites him to ask for what he needs. He gives it to him and fulfills his expectations. When he passes away from there, if he comes back to this world, whatever business he undertakes fulfills his expectations.

(4) "Someone else approaches an ascetic or a brahmin and invites him to ask for what he needs. He gives it to him and surpasses his expectations. When he passes away from there, if he comes back to this world, whatever business he undertakes surpasses his expectations.

"This, Sāriputta, is the reason why for one person here the business he undertakes ends in failure, for another the same kind of business does not fulfill his expectations, for still another the same kind of business fulfills his expectations, and for still another the same kind of business surpasses his expectations."

80 (10) Kamboja

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita's Park. Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:

"Bhante, why is it that women do not sit in council, or engage in business, or go to Kamboja?"774

"Ānanda, women are prone to anger; women are envious; [83] women are miserly; women are unwise. This is why women do not sit in council, engage in business, or go to Kamboja."

# IV. UNSHAKABLE

81 (1) The Destruction of Life

"Bhikkhus, one possessing four [other] qualities is deposited in heaven as if brought there. What four?

## 84 (4) Anger

"Bhikkhus, one possessing four qualities is deposited in hell as if brought there. What four?

"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? The one heading from darkness to darkness, the one heading from darkness to light, the one heading from light to darkness, and the one heading from light to light.

(1) "And how, bhikkhus, is a person heading from darkness to darkness? Here, some person has been reborn in a low familya family of candalas, bamboo workers, hunters, cart makers, or flower scavengers ${ }^{770}$ - one that is poor, with little food and drink, that subsists with difficulty, where food and clothing are obtained with difficulty; and he is ugly, unsightly, dwarfish, with much illness-blind, crippled, lame, or paralyzed. He does not obtain food, drink, clothing, and vehicles; garlands, scents, and unguents; bedding, housing, and lighting. He engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. In consequence, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. It is in this way that a person is heading from darkness to darkness.

(2) "And how is a person heading from darkness to light? Here, some person has been reborn in a low family... where food and clothing are obtained with difficulty; and he is ugly ... or paralyzed. He does not obtain food ... and lighting. He engages in good conduct by body, speech, and mind. In consequence, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. It is in this way that a person is heading from darkness to light.

(3) "And how is a person heading from light to darkness? [86]. Here, some person has been reborn in a high family-an affluent khattiya family, an affluent brahmin family, or an affluent householder family-one that is rich, with great wealth and property, with abundant gold and silver, with abundant treasures and belongings, with abundant wealth and grain; and he is handsome, attractive, graceful, possessing supreme beauty
of complexion. He obtains food, drink, clothing, and vehicles; garlands, scents, and unguents; bedding, housing, and lighting. He engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind.

(1) "And how, bhikkhus, is a person an ascetic unshaken? Here, a bhikkhu is a trainee practicing the way who dwells aspiring for the unsurpassed security from bondage.

(2) "And how is a person a white-lotus ascetic? Here, with
the destruction of the taints, a bhikkhu has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it; yet he does not dwell having contacted with the body the eight emancipations.

His fellow monks, those with whom he dwells, usually behave toward him in agreeable ways by body, speech, and mind, seldom in disagreeable ways.

It is in this way that a person is a delicate ascetic among ascetics.

"If, bhikkhus, one could rightly say of anyone: 'He is a delicate ascetic among ascetics,' it is precisely of me that one might say
this. For I usually use a robe that has been specifically offered to me, seldom one that has not been specifically offered to me; I usually eat almsfood that has been specifically offered to me, seldom almsfood that has not been specifically offered to me; I usually use a lodging that has been specifically offered to me, seldom one that has not been specifically offered to me; I usually use medicines and provisions for the sick that have been specifically offered to me, seldom those that have not been specifically offered to me.

Then the wanderer Potaliya approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had exchanged greetings and cordial talk, the wanderer Potaliya sat down to one side, and the Blessed One then said to him:

"Potaliya, there are these four kinds of persons found exist-
ing in the world. What four? (1) Here, some person speaks dispraise of someone who deserves dispraise, and the dispraise is accurate, truthful, and timely; but he does not speak praise of someone who deserves praise, though the praise would be accurate, truthful, and timely.

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

Here, someone masters the Dhammathe discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts, and questions-and-answers-but he does not understand as it really is: 'This is suffering,' and 'This is the origin of suffering,' and 'This is the cessation of suffering,' and 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' It is in this way that a person is one who makes a hole but does not live in it. So, I say, this person is just like a mouse that makes a hole but does not live in it.

# II. KesI

## 111 (1) Kesi

Then Kesi the horse trainer approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Kesi, you are reputed to be a horse trainer. Just how do you discipline a horse to be tamed?"

"Bhante, I discipline one kind of horse gently, another kind sternly, and still another kind both gently and sternly."

"But, Kesi, if a horse to be tamed by you won't submit to discipline by any of these methods, how do you deal with him?"

"Bhante, if a horse to be tamed by me won't submit to discipline by any of these methods, then I kill him. For what reason? So that there will be no disgrace to my teacher's guild. But, Bhante, the Blessed One is the unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed. Just how does the Blessed One discipline a person to be tamed?"

"I discipline one kind of person gently, another kind sternly,
and still another kind both gently and sternly. (1) This, Kesi, is the gentle method: 'Such is bodily good conduct, such the result of bodily good conduct; such is verbal good conduct, such the result of verbal good conduct; such is mental good conduct, such the result of mental good conduct; such are the devas, such are human beings.' (2) This is the stern method: 'Such is bodily misconduct, such the result of bodily misconduct; such is verbal misconduct, such the result of verbal misconduct; such is mental misconduct, such the result of mental misconduct; such is hell, such the animal realm, such the sphere of afflicted spirits.' (3) This is the gentle and stern method: 'Such is bodily good conduct, such the result of bodily good conduct; such is bodily misconduct, such the result of bodily misconduct. Such is verbal good conduct, such the result of verbal good conduct; such is verbal misconduct, such the result of verbal misconduct. Such is mental good conduct, such the result of mental good conduct; such is mental misconduct, such the result of mental misconduct. Such are the devas, such are human beings; such is hell, such the animal realm, such the sphere of afflicted spirits."

"But, Bhante, if a person to be tamed by you won't submit to discipline by any of these methods, [113] how does the Blessed One deal with him?"

(4) "If a person to be tamed by me won't submit to discipline by any of these methods, then I kill him."

"But, Bhante, it isn't allowable for the Blessed One to destroy life. Yet he says, 'Then I kill him.'"

"It is true, Kesi, that it isn't allowable for the Tathāgata to destroy life. However, when a person to be tamed won't submit to discipline by the gentle method, the stern method, or the method that is both gentle and stern, then the Tathāgata thinks he should not be spoken to and instructed, and his wise fellow monks, too, think he should not be spoken to and instructed. For this, Kesi, is 'killing' in the Noble One's discipline: the Tathāgata thinks one should not be spoken to and instructed, and one's wise fellow monks, too, think one should not be spoken to and instructed."

"He is indeed well slain, Bhante, when the Tathāgata thinks he should not be spoken to and instructed, and his wise fellow monks, too, think he should not be spoken to and instructed.
"Excellent, Bhante! Excellent, Bhante! The Blessed One has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the darkness so those with good eyesight can see forms. I now go for refuge to the Blessed One, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. Let the Blessed One consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

listens? Here, whatever task the elephant trainer sets for it, whether or not it has ever done it before, the king's bull elephant heeds it, attends to it, directs his whole mind to it, and listens with eager ears. It is in this way that a king's bull elephant is one who listens.

(2) "And how is a king's bull elephant one who destroys? Here, when a king's bull elephant has entered the battle, it destroys elephants and elephant riders; it destroys horses and cavalry; [117] it destroys chariots and charioteers; it destroys infantry.

to time, but abandons them, dispels them, terminates them, and obliterates them. It is in this way that a bhikkhu is one who destroys.

(2) "Next, take the case of the deed that is disagreeable to do which will prove beneficial. It is in this case that one can understand who is a fool and who is a wise person in regard to manly strength, manly energy, and manly exertion. The fool does not reflect thus: 'Although this deed is disagreeable to do, still [119] it will prove beneficial.' So he does not do that deed, and his refraining from it proves harmful. But the wise person does reflect thus: 'Although this deed is disagreeable to do, still it will prove beneficial.' So he does that deed, and it proves beneficial.
(3) "Next, take the case of the deed that is agreeable to do which will prove harmful. It is in this case, too, that one can understand who is a fool and who is a wise person in regard to manly strength, manly energy, and manly exertion. The fool does not reflect thus: 'Although this deed is agreeable to do, still it will prove harmful.' So he does that deed, and it proves harmful.

provoke hatred!' One bent on his own welfare should practice heedfulness, mindfulness, and guarding of the mind thus.

## 121 (1) Self-Reproach

"Bhikkhus, there are these four perils. What four? The peril of self-reproach, the peril of reproach by others, the peril of punishment, and the peril of a bad destination.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the peril of self-reproach? Here, someone reflects thus: 'If I were to engage in bodily, verbal, or mental misconduct, wouldn't I reprove myself because of my behavior?' Afraid of the peril of self-reproach, he abandons bodily misconduct and develops bodily good conduct; he abandons verbal misconduct and develops verbal good conduct; he abandons mental misconduct and develops mental good conduct; he maintains himself in purity. This is called the peril of self-reproach.

(2) "And what is the peril of reproach by others? [122] Here, someone reflects thus: 'If I were to engage in bodily, verbal, or mental misconduct, wouldn't others reprove me because of my behavior?' Afraid of the peril of reproach by others, he abandons bodily misconduct and develops bodily good conduct; he abandons verbal misconduct and develops verbal good conduct; he abandons mental misconduct and develops mental good conduct; he maintains himself in purity. This is called the peril of reproach by others.

(3) "And what is the peril of punishment? ${ }^{893}$ Here, someone sees that when kings arrest a thief who has committed a crime, they subject him to various punishments: they have him flogged with whips, beaten with canes, beaten with clubs; they have his hands cut off, his feet cut off, his hands and feet cut off; his ears cut off, his nose cut off, his ears and nose cut off; they have him subjected to the 'porridge pot,' to the 'polished-shell shave,' to the 'Rāhu's mouth,' to the 'fiery wreath,' to the 'flanìing hand,' to the 'blades of grass,' to the 'bark dress,' to the 'antelope,' to the 'meat hooks,' to the 'coins,' to the 'lye pickling,' to the 'pivoting pin,' to the 'rolled-up palliasse'; and they have him
splashed with boiling oil, and they have him devoured by dogs, and they have him impaled alive on a stake, and they have his head cut off with a sword.

"It occurs to him: 'When kings have arrested a thief who has committed a crime, they subject him to various punishments because of such bad deeds: they have him flogged with whips ... they have his head cut off with a sword. Now if I were to commit such an evil deed, and if kings were to arrest me, they would subject me to the same punishments. They would have me flogged with whips ... they would have my head cut off with a sword.' Afraid of the peril of punishment, he does not go about plundering the belongings of others. This is called the peril of punishment. [123]

(4) "And what is the peril of a bad destination? Here, someone reflects thus: 'Bodily misconduct has bad results ${ }^{804}$ in future lives; verbal misconduct has bad results in future lives; mental misconduct has bad results in future lives. Now if I were to engage in misconduct with body, speech, and mind, then with the breakup of the body, after death, I would be reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.' Afraid of the peril of a bad destination, he abandons bodily misconduct and develops bodily good conduct; he abandons verbal misconduct and develops verbal good conduct; he abandons mental misconduct and develops mental good conduct; he maintains himself in purity. This is called the peril of a bad destination.

These are the four perils to be expected for one who enters the water. So too, there are these four perils to be expected for a clansman who has gone forth out of faith from the household life into homelessness in this Dhamma and discipline. What four? The peril of waves, the peril of crocodiles, the peril of whirlpools, and the peril of fierce fish.

homelessness with the thought: 'I am immersed in birth, old age, and death; in sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish. I am immersed in suffering, afflicted by suffering. Perhaps an ending of this entire mass of suffering can be attained.' Then, after he has thus gone forth, his fellow monks exhort and instruct him: 'You should go forward in this way, return in this way; [124] look ahead in this way, look aside in this way; draw in your limbs in this way, extend them in this way; you should wear your robes and carry your outer robe and bowl in this way.' He thinks: 'Formerly, when I was a layman, I exhorted and instructed others. But now these [monks], who are young enough to be my sons or grandsons, presume to exhort and instruct me.' Being angry and displeased, he gives up the training and reverts to the lower life. This is called a bhikkhu who has given up the training and reverted to the lower life because of the peril of waves. 'The peril of waves' is a designation for anger and irritation. This is called the peril of waves.

(2) "And what is the peril' of crocodiles? Here, a clansman has gone forth out of faith from the household life into homelessness with the thought: 'I am immersed in birth, old age, and death; in sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish. I am immersed in suffering, afflicted by suffering. Perhaps an ending of this entire mass of suffering can be attained.' Then, after he has thus gone forth, his fellow monks exhort and instruct him: 'You may consume this but not that; you may eat this but not that, ${ }^{807}$ you may taste this but not that; you may drink this but not that. You can consume, eat, taste, and drink what is allowable, not what is unallowable. You may consume, eat, taste, and drink within the proper time, not outside the proper time.' He thinks: 'Formerly, when I was a layman, I consumed whatever I wanted to consume and did not consume anything I did not wish to consume. I ate whatever I wanted to eat and did not eat anything I did not wish to eat. I tasted whatever I wanted to taste and did not taste anything I did not wish to taste. I drank whatever I wanted to drink and did not drink anything I did not wish to drink. I consumed, ate, tasted, and drank both what was allowable and what was not allowable. I consumed, ate, tasted, and drank both within the proper time and outside the proper time. [125] But now when faithful householders give us delicious things to consume and
eat during the day outside the proper time, these [monks] seem to put a gag over our mouths.' Being angry and displeased, he gives up the training and reverts to the lower life. This is called a bhikkhu who has given up the training and reverted to the lower life because of the peril of crocodiles. 'The peril of crocodiles' is a designation for gluttony. This is called the peril of crocodiles.

(3) "And what is the peril of whirlpools? Here, a clansman has gone forth out of faith from the household life into homelessness with the thought: 'I am immersed in birth, old age, and death; in sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish. I am immersed in suffering, afflicted by suffering. Perhaps an ending of this entire mass of suffering can be attained.' Then, after he has thus gone forth, in the morning he dresses, takes his bowl and robe, and enters a village or town for alms, with body, speech, and mind unguarded, without having established mindfulness, his sense faculties unrestrained. He sees a householder or a householder's son there enjoying himself, furnished and endowed with the five objects of sensual pleasure. It occurs to him: 'Formerly, when I was a layman, I enjoyed myself, furnished and endowed with the five objects of sensual pleasure. My family has wealth. I can both enjoy that wealth and do meritorious deeds. Let me now give up the training and revert to the lower life so that I can both enjoy that wealth and do meritorious deeds.' So he gives up the training and reverts to the lower life. This is called a bhikkhu who has given up the training and reverted to the lower life because of the peril of whirlpools. 'The peril of whirlpools' is a designation for the five objects of sensual pleasure. This is called the peril of whirlpools.

(4) "And what is the peril of fierce fish? Here, a clansman has gone forth out of faith from the household life into homelessness with the thought: 'I am immersed in birth, old age, and death; in sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish. I am immersed in suffering, afflicted by suffering. Perhaps an ending of this entire mass of suffering can be attained.' Then, after he has thus gone forth, in the morning he dresses, takes his bowl and robe, and enters a village or town for alms, [126] with body, speech, and mind unguarded, without having established mindfulness, his sense faculties unrestrained. There he sees
women with their dress in disarray and loosely attired. When he sees them, lust invades his mind. With his mind invaded by lust, he gives up the training and reverts to the lower life. This is called a bhikkhu who has given up the training and reverted to the lower life because of the peril of fierce fish. 'The peril of fierce fish' is a designation for women. This is called the peril of fierce fish.

"These, bhikkhus, are the four perils to be expected for a clansman who has gone forth out of faith from the household life into homelessness in this Dhamma and discipline."

(4) "Again, some person; with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity. He relishes it, desires it, and finds satisfaction in it. [128] If he is firm in it, focused on it, often dwells in it, and has not lost it when he dies, he is reborn in companionship with the devas of great fruit. The life span of the devas of great fruit is five hundred eons. ${ }^{814}$ The worldling remains there all his life, and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas, he goes to hell, to the animal realm, or to the sphere of afflicted spirits.

(1) "And how, bhikkhus, has a person gone on retreat by body but not gone on retreat by mind? Here, some person resorts to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves, but there he thinks sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of harming. It is in this way that a person has gone on retreat by body but has not gone on retreat by mind.

(2) "And how has a person not gone on retreat by body but gone on retreat by mind? Here, some person does not resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves, but he thinks thoughts of renunciation, thoughts of good will, and thoughts of harmlessness. It is in this way that a person has not gone on retreat by body but gone on retreat by mind.

(3) "And how has a person gone on retreat neither by body nor by mind? Here, some person does not resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves. [138] and he thinks sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of harming. It is in
this way that a person has gone on retreat neither by body nor by mind.

# 157 (7) Illness

"Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of illness. Which two? [143] Bodily illness and mental illness. People are found who can claim to enjoy bodily health for one, two, three, four, and five years; for ten, twenty, thirty, forty, and fifty years; and even for a hundred years and more. But apart from those whose taints have been destroyed, it is hard to find people in the world who can claim to enjoy mental health even for a moment.

"There are, bhikkhus, these four illnesses incurred by a monk. What four? (1) Here, a bhikkhu has strong desires, undergoes distress, and is not content with any kind of robe, almsfood, lodging, or medicines and provisions for the sick. ${ }^{840}$ (2) Because he has strong desires, undergoes distress, and is not content with any kind of robe, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick, he submits to evil desire for recognition and for gain, honor, and praise. (3) He arouses himself, strives, and makes an effort to obtain recognition and gain, honor, and praise. (4) He cunningly approaches families, cunningly sits down, cunningly speaks on the Dhamma, and cunningly holds in his excrement and urine. ${ }^{841}$ These are the four illnesses incurred by a monk.

"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will not have strong desires or undergo distress, and we will not be discontent with any kind of robe, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisioris for the sick. We will not submit to evil desires for recognition and for gain, honor, and praise. We will
not arouse ourselves, strive, and make an effort to obtain recognition and gain, honor, and praise. We will patiently endure cold and heat, hunger and thirst; contact with flies, mosquitoes, wind, the burning sun, and serpents; rude and offensive ways of speech; we will bear up with arisen bodily feelings that are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, harrowing, disagreeable, sapping one's vitality.' It is in this way, bhikkhus, that you should train yourselves."

# 158 (8) Decline

There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, [144] bhikkhus!"

"Friend!" those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:

"Friends, any bhikkhu or bhikkhuni who observes four things: inwardly can come to the conclusion: 'I am declining in wholesome qualities. This is called decline by the Blessed One.' What four? An abundance of lust, an abundance of hatred, an abundance of delusion, and his wisdom eye does not tread in the deep matters of what is possible and impossible. ${ }^{942}$ Any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who observes these four things inwardly can come to the conclusion: 'I am declining in wholesome qualities. This is called decline by the Blessed One.'

"Friends, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who observes four things inwardly can come to the conclusion: 'I am not declining in wholesome qualities. This is called non-decline by the Blessed One.' What four? The diminishing of lust, the diminishing of hatred, the diminishing of delusion, and his wisdom eye treads in the deep matters of what is possible and impossible. Any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who observes these four things inwardly can come to the conclusion: 'I am not declining in wholesome qualities. This is called non-decline by the Blessed One.'"

## 159 (9) The Bhikkhunī

On one occasion the Venerable Ananda was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita's Park. Then a certain bhikkhunī addressed a man thus: 'Come, good man, approach Master Ānanda and pay homage to him in my name with your head at his feet. Then say: 'Bhante, the bhikkhunī so-and-so is sick, afflicted, gravely ill. She pays homage to Master Ānanda with her head at his
feet.' Then say: 'It would be good, Bhante, if, out of compassion, Master Ānanda would come to visit that bhikkhunī in the bhikkhunīs' quarters.'"

"Yes, noble lady," that man replied. He then approached the Venerable Ānanda, [145] paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and delivered his message. The Venerable Ānanda consented by silence.

Then the Venerable Ānanda dressed, took his bowl and robe, and went to the bhikkhunīs' quarters. When that bhikkhunī saw the Venerable Ānanda coming in the distance, she covered herself from the head down and lay down on her bed. ${ }^{843}$ Then the Venerable Ānanda approached that bhikkhunī, sat down in the appointed seat, and said to her:

"Sister, this body has originated from nutriment; in dependence on nutriment, nutriment is to be abandoned. This body has originated from craving; in dependence on craving, craving is to be abandoned. This body has originated from conceit; in dependence on conceit, conceit is to be abandoned. This body has originated from sexual intercourse, but in regard to sexual intercourse the Blessed One has declared the demolition of the bridge. ${ }^{844}$

(1) "When it was said: 'This body, sister, has originated from nutriment; in dependence on nutriment, nutriment is to be abandoned,' for what reason was this said? Here, sister, reflecting carefully, a bhikkhu consumes food neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness, but only for the support and maintenance of this body, for avoiding harm, and for assisting the spiritual life, considering: 'Thus I shall terminate the old feeling and not arouse a new feeling, and I shall be healthy and blameless and dwell at ease.' Some time later, in dependence upon nutriment, he abandons nutriment. ${ }^{845}$ When it was said: 'This body, sister, has originated from nutriment; in dependence on nutriment, nutriment is to be abandoned,' it is because of this that this was said.

(2) "When it was said: 'This body has originated from craving; in dependence on craving, craving is to be abandoned,' for what [146] reason was this said? Here, sister, a bhikkhu hears: 'The bhikkhu named so-and-so, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom,
and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.' He thinks: 'When will I, with the destruction of the taints, realize for myself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwell in it?' Some time later, in dependence upon craving, he abandons craving. When it was said: 'This body has originated from craving; in dependence on craving, craving is to be abandoned,' it was because of this that this was said.

(3) "When it was said: 'This body has originated from conceit; in dependence on conceit, conceit is to be abandoned.' With reference to what was this said? Here, sister, a bhikkhu hears: 'The bhikkhu named so-and-so, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.' He thinks: 'That venerable one, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. Why, so can I!' Some time later, in dependence upon conceit, he abandons conceit. When it was said: 'This body has originated from conceit; in dependence on conceit, conceit is to be abandoned,' it was because of this that this was said.

(4) "This body, sister, has originated from sexual intercourse, but in regard to sexual intercourse the Blessed One has declared the demolition of the bridge. ${ }^{\prime 846}$

Then that bhikkhunī got up from her bed, arranged her upper robe over one shoulder, and having prostrated herself with her head at the Venerable Ānanda's feet, she said to the Venerable Ānanda: "Bhante, I have committed a transgression in that I so foolishly, stupidly, and unskillfully behaved as I did. Bhante, may Master Ananda accept my transgression seen as a transgression for the sake of future restraint."

"Surely, sister, you have committed a transgression in that you so foolishly, stupidly, and unskillfully behaved as you did. But since you see your transgression as a transgression and make amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma, we accept it. For it is growth in the Noble One's discipline that one sees one's transgression as a transgression, makes amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma, and undertakes future restraint." [147]

160 (10) A Fortunate One ${ }^{847}$

"Bhikkhus, while the Fortunate One or the Fortunate One's discipline remains in the world, this is for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans.

"And who, bhikkhus, is the Fortunate One? Here, the Tathāgata arises in the world, an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One. This is the Fortunate One.

"And what is the Fortunate One's discipline? He teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; he reveals the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life. This is the Fortunate One's discipline. Thus while the Fortunate One or the Fortunate One's discipline remains in the world, this is for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans.

"There are, bhikkhus, these four things that lead to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma. What four?

(1) "Here, the bhikkhus learn discourses that have been badly acquired, with badly set down words and phrases. ${ }^{848}$ When the words and phrases are badly set down, the meaning is badly interpreted. This is the first thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma.

(2) "Again, the bhikkhus are difficult to correct and possess qualities that make them difficult to correct. They are impatient and do not accept instruction respectfully. This is the second thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma.

(3) "Again, those bhikkhus who are learned, heirs to the heritage, experts on the Dhamma, experts on the discipline, experts on the outlines, do not respectfully teach the discourses to others. When they have passed away, the discourses are cut off at the root, left without anyone to preserve them. This is the third thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma.
(4) "Again, the elder bhikkhus are luxurious [148] and lax, leaders in backsliding, discarding the duty of solitude; they do not arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. [Those in] the next generation follow their example. They, too, become luxurious and lax, leaders in backsliding, discarding the duty of solitude; they, too, do not arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved; for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. This is the fourth thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma.

"These are the four things that lead to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma.

"There are, bhikkhus, these four [other] things that lead to the continuation, non-decline, and non-disappearance of the good Dhamma. What four?

(1) "Here, the bhikkhus learn discourses that have been well acquired, with well set down words and phrases. When the words and phrases are well set down, the meaning is well interpreted. This is the first thing that leads to the continuation, nondecline, and non-disappearance of the good Dhamma.

(2) "Again, the bhikkhus are easy to correct and possess qualities that make them easy to correct. They are patient and accept instruction respectfully. This is the second thing that leads to the continuation, non-decline, and non-disappearance of the good Dhamma.

(3) "Again, those bhikkhus who are learned, heirs to the heritage, experts on the Dhamma, experts on the discipline, experts on the outlines, respectfully teach the discourses to others. When they have passed away, the discourses are not cut off at the root for there are those who preserve them. This is the third thing that leads to the continuation, non-decline, and non-disappearance of the good Dhamma.

(4) "Again, the elder bhikkhus are not luxurious and lax, but they discard backsliding and take the lead in solitude; they arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. [Those in] the next generation follow their example. They, too, do not become luxurious and lax, but they discard backsliding and take the lead in solitude; they, too,
arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. This is the fourth thing that leads to the continuation, non-decline, and non-disappearance of the good Dhamma. [149]

"These, bhikkhus, are the four things that lead to the continuation, non-decline, and non-disappearance of the good Dhamma."

# II. Modes of Practice

161 (1) In Brief ${ }^{849}$

"Bhikkhus, there are these four modes of practice. What four? (1) Practice that is painful with sluggish direct knowledge; (2) practice that is painful with quick direct knowledge; (3) practice that is pleasant with sluggish direct knowledge; and (4) practice that is pleasant with quick direct knowledge. ${ }^{850}$ These are the four modes of practice."

## 162 (2) In Detail

"Bhikkhus, there are these four modes of practice. What four? (1) Practice that is painful with sluggish direct knowledge; (2) practice that is painful with quick direct knowledge; (3) practice that is pleasant with sluggish direct knowledge; and (4) practice that is pleasant with quick direct knowledge.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the practice that is painful with sluggish direct knowledge? Here, someone is by nature strongly prone to lust and often experiences pain and dejection born of lust. By nature he is strongly prone to hatred and often experiences pain and dejection born of hatred. By nature he is strongly prone to delusion and often experiences pain and dejection born of delusion. These five faculties arise in him feebly: the faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, and the faculty of wisdom: Because these five faculties are feeble in him, he sluggishly attains the immediacy condition for the destruction of the taints. ${ }^{851}$ This is called practice that is painful with sluggish direct knowledge.

(2) "And what is practice that is painful with quick direct knowledge? Here, someone is by nature strongly prone to lust...hatred...delusion and often experiences pain and
dejection born of delusion. These five faculties arise in him prominently: [150] the faculty of faith . . . the faculty of wisdom. Because these five faculties are prominent in him, he quickly attains the immediacy condition for the destruction of the taints. This is called practice that is painful with quick direct knowledge.

(3) "And what is practice that is pleasant with sluggish direct knowledge? Here, someone by nature is not strongly prone to lust and does not often experience pain and dejection born of lust. By nature he is not strongly prone to hatred and does not often experience pain and dejection born of hatred.

"These, bhikkhus, are the four modes of practice."

# 163 (3) Unattractiveness

[Opening paragraph as above.]

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is practice that is painful with sluggish direct knowledge? Here, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the unattractiveness of the body, perceiving the repulsiveness of food, perceiving non-delight in the entire world, contemplating impermanence in all conditioned phenomena; and he has the perception of death well established internally. He dwells depending upon these five trainee powers: the power of faith, the power of moral shame, the power of moral dread, [151] the power of energy, and the power of wisdom. ${ }^{852}$ These five
faculties arise in him feebly: the faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, and the faculty of wisdom. Because these five faculties are feeble, he sluggishly attains the immediacy condition for the destruction of the taints. This is called practice that is painful with sluggish direct knowledge.

(2) "And what is practice that is painful with quick direct knowledge? Here, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the unattractiveness of the body ... and he has the perception of death well established internally. He dwells depending upon these five trainee powers: the power of faith... the power of wisdom. These five faculties arise in him prominently: the faculty of faith . . . the faculty of wisdom. Because these five faculties are prominent, he quickly attains the immediacy condition for the destruction of the taints. This is called practice that is painful with quick direct knowledge.

(3) "And what is practice that is pleasant with sluggish direct knowledge? Here, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. With the subsiding of thought and examination, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration, without thought and examination. With the fading away as well of rapture, he dwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, he experiences pleasure with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: 'He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.' With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity. He dwells depending upon these five trainee powers: the power of faith ... the power of wisdom. These five faculties arise in him feebly: the faculty of faith... the faculty of wisdom. Because these five faculties are feeble, he sluggishly attains the immediacy condition for the destruction of the taints. This is called practice that is pleasant with sluggish direct knowledge.

(4) "And what is practice that is pleasant with quick direct
knowledge? Here, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna... the second jhāna... the third jhāna...[152] the fourth jhāna. He dwells depending upon these five trainee powers: the power of faith . . . the power of wisdom. These five faculties arise in him prominently: the faculty of faith ... the faculty of wisdom. Because these five faculties are prominent, he quickly attains the immediacy condition for the destruction of the taints. This is called practice that is pleasant with quick direct knowledge.

"These, bhikkhus, are the four modes of practice."

164 (4) Patient (1)

"Bhikkhus, there are these four modes of practice. What four? The impatient practice, the patient practice, the taming practice, and the calming practice.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the impatient practice? Here, someone insults one who insults him, scolds one who scolds him, and argues with one who picks an argument with him. This is called the impatient practice.

(2) "And what is the patient practice? Here, someone does not insult one who insults him, does not scold one who scolds him, and does not argue with one who picks an argument with him. This is called the patient practice.

(3) "And what is the taming practice? Here, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu does not grasp its marks and features. Since, if he left the eye faculty unrestrained, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him, he practices restraint over it; he guards the eye faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. Having heard a sound with the ear ... Having smelled an odor with the nose ... Having tasted a taste with the tongue... Having felt a tactile object with the body... Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, a bhikkhu does not grasp its marks and features. Since, if he left the mind faculty unrestrained, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him, he practices restraint over it; [153] he guards the mind faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty. This is called the taming practice.

(4) "And what is the calming practice? Here, a bhikkhu does not tolerate an arisen sensual thought; he abandons it, dispels
it, calms it down, terminates it, and obliterates it. ${ }^{853}$ He does not tolerate an arisen thought of ill will... an arisen thought of harming...bad unwholesome states whenever they arise; he abandons them, dispels them, calms them down, terminates them, and obliterates them. This is called the calming practice.

"These, bhikkhus, are the four modes of practice."

# 165 (5) Patient (2)

"Bhikkhus, there are these four modes of practice. What four? The impatient practice, the patient practice, the taming practice, and the calming practice.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the impatient practice? Here, someone does not patiently endure cold and heat; hunger and thirst; contact with flies, mosquitoes, wind, the burning sun, and serpents; rude and offensive ways of speech; he is unable to bear up with arisen bodily feelings that are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, harrowing, disagreeable, sapping one's vitality. This is called the impatient practice.

(2) "And what is the patient practice? Here, someone patiently endures cold and heat ... rude and offensive ways of speech; he is able to bear up with arisen bodily feelings that are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, harrowing, disagreeable, sapping one's vitality.

(1) Practice that is painful with sluggish direct knowledge; (2) practice that is painful with quick direct knowledge; (3) practice that is pleasant with sluggish direct knowledge; and (4) practice that is pleasant with quick direct knowledge.

(1) "The mode of practice that is painful with sluggish direct knowledge is declared to be inferior for both reasons: because it is painful and because direct knowledge is sluggish. This mode of practice is declared to be inferior for both reasons.

(2) "The mode of practice that is painful with quick di-
rect knowledge is declared to be inferior becalise of its painfulness.

(3) "The mode of practice that is pleasant with sluggish direct knowledge is declared to be inferior because of its sluggishness.

(4) "The mode of practice that is pleasant with quick direct knowledge is declared to be superior for both reasons: because practice is pleasant and because direct knowledge is quick. This mode of practice is declared to be superior for both reasons.

"These, bhikkhus, are the four modes of practice."

# 167 (7) Moggallāna

Then the Venerable Sāriputta approached the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna:

"Friend Moggallāna, there are these four modes of practice. What four? (1) Practice that is painful with sluggish direct knowledge; (2) practice that is painful with quick direct knowledge; (3) practice that is pleasant with sluggish direct knowledge; and (4) practice that is pleasant with quick direct knowledge. Through which of these four modes of practice was your mind liberated from the taints by non-clinging?" [155]

"Of these four modes of practice, friend Sāriputta, it was through the mode that is painful with quick direct knowledge that my mind was liberated from the taints by nonclinging." ${ }^{\prime 854}$

## 168 (8) Sāriputta

Then the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna approached the Venerable Sāriputta . . . and said to him:

"Friend Säriputta, there are these four modes of practice.... Through which of these four modes of practice was your mind liberated from the taints by non-clinging?"

"Of these four modes of practice, friend Moggallāna, it was through the mode that is pleasant with quick direct knowledge that my mind was liberated from the taints by non-clinging."

169 (9) Through Exertion

"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four?
(1) "Here, some person attains nibbāna through exertion in this very life. (2) Another person attains nibbāna through exertion with the breakup of the body. ${ }^{859}$ (3) Still another person attains nibbāna without exertion in this very life. (4) And still another person attains nibbāna without exertion with the breakup of the body. ${ }^{856}$

(1) "And how, bhikkhus, does a person attain nibbāna through exertion in this very life? Here, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the unattractiveness of the body, perceiving the repulsiveness of food, perceiving non-delight in the entire world, contemplating impermanence in all conditioned phenomena; and he has the perception of death [156] well established internally. He dwells depending upon these five trainee powers: the power of faith, the power of moral shame, the power of moral dread, the power of energy, and the power of wisdom. These five faculties arise in him prominently: the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. Because these five faculties are prominent, he attains nibbāna through exertion in this very life. This is how a person attains nibbāna through exertion in this very life.

(2) "And how does a person attain nibbāna through exertion with the breakup of the body? Here, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the unattractiveness of the body ... and he has the perception of death well established internally. He dwells depending upon these five trainee powers: the powers of faith ... and wisdom. These five faculties arise in him feebly: the faculties of faith . . . and wisdom. Because these five faculties are feeble, he attains nibbāna through exertion with the breakup of the body. This is how a person attains nibbāna through exertion with the breakup of the body.

(3) "And how does a person attain nibbāna without exertion in this very life? Here, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna . . . the fourth jhāna. He dwells depending upon these five trainee powers: the powers of faith ... and wisdom. These five faculties arise in him prominently: the faculties of faith ... and wisdom. Because these five faculties are prominent, he attains nibbāna without exertion in this very life. This is how a person attains nibbāna without exertion in this very life.

(4) "And how does a person attain nibbāna without exertion
with the breakup of the body? Here, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna . . . the fourth jhāna. He dwells depending upon these five trainee powers: the powers of faith... and wisdom. These five faculties arise in him feebly: the faculties of faith... and wisdom. Because these five faculties are feeble, he attains nibbāna without exertion with the breakup of the body. This is how a person attains nibbāna without exertion with the breakup of the body.

"These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world."

# 170 (10) In Conjunction

On one occasion the Venerable Ānanda was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita's Park. There the Venerable Ānanda addressed the bhikkhus:

"Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend," those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Ānanda said this: [157]

"Friends, whatever bhikkhu or bhikkhunī has declared the attainment of arahantship in my presence has done so by these four paths ${ }^{857}$ or by a certain one among them. What four?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu develops insight preceded by serenity. As he is developing insight preceded by serenity, the path is generated. ${ }^{858}$ He pursues this path; develops it, and cultivates it. As he is pursuing, developing, and cultivating this path, the fetters are abandoned and the underlying tendencies are uprooted. ${ }^{859}$

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu develops serenity preceded by insight. ${ }^{860}$ As he is developing serenity preceded by insight, the path is generated. He pursues this path, develops it, and cultivates it. As he is pursuing, developing, and cultivating this path, the fetters are abandoned and the underlying tendencies are uprooted.

(3) "Again, a bhikkhu develops serenity and insight in conjunction. ${ }^{861}$ As he is developing serenity and insight in conjunction, the path is generated. He pursues this path, develops it, and cultivates it. As he is pursuing, developing, and cultivating this path, the fetters are abandoned and the underlying tendencies are uprooted.

(4) "Again, a bhikkhu's mind is seized by restlessness about
the Dhamma. ${ }^{862}$ But there comes an occasion when his mind becomes internally steady, composed, unified, and concentrated. Then the path is generated in him. He pursues this path, develops it, and cultivates it. As he is pursuing, developing, and cultivating this path, the fetters are abandoned and the underlying tendencies are uprooted.

"Whatever bhikkhu or bhikkhunī, friends, has declared the attainment of arahantship in my presence has done so by these four paths or by a certain one among them."

# III. Volitional.

171 (1) Volition ${ }^{863}$

"Bhikkhus, when there is the body, then because of bodily volition [158] pleasure and pain arise internally; when there is speech, then because of verbal volition pleasure and pain arise internally; when there is the mind, then because of mental volition pleasure and pain arise internally-with ignorance itself as condition. ${ }^{864}$

"Either on one's own, bhikkhus, one performs that bodily. volitional activity conditioned by which pleasure and pain arise in one internally, or others make one generate that bodily volitional activity conditioned by which pleasure and pain arise in one internally. Either with clear comprehension one performs that bodily volitional activity conditioned by which pleasure and pain arise in one internally, or without clear comprehension one performs that bodily volitional activity conditioned by which pleasure and pain arise in one internally. ${ }^{865}$

"Either on one's own, bhikkhus, one performs that verbal volitional activity conditioned by which pleasure and pain arise in one internally, or others make one perform that verbal volitional activity conditioned by which pleasure and pain arise in one internally. Either with clear comprehension one performs that verbal volitional activity conditioned by which pleasure and pain arise in one internally, or without clear comprehension one performs that verbal volitional activity conditioned by which pleasure and pain arise in one internally.

"Either on one's own, bhikkhus, one performs that mental volitional activity conditioned by which pleasure and pain arise in one internally, or others make one perform that mental voli-
tional activity conditioned by which pleasure and pain arise in one internally. Either with clear comprehension one performs that mental volitional activity conditioned by which pleasure and pain arise in one internally, or without clear comprehension one performs that mental volitional activity conditioned by which pleasure and pain arise in one internally.

"Ignorance is comprised within these states. ${ }^{866}$ But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance that body does not exist conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in one internally; that speech does not exist conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in one internally; that mind does not exist conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in one internally. ${ }^{867}$ That field does not exist, that site [159] does not exist, that base does not exist, that location does not exist conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in one internally. ${ }^{888}$.

"Bhikkhus, there are these four acquisitions of individuality. ${ }^{869}$ What four? (1) There is an acquisition of individuality in which one's own volition operates, not the volition of others. (2) There is an acquisition of individuality in which the volition of others operates, not one's own volition. (3) There is an acquisition of individuality in which both one's own volition and the volition of others operate. (4) And there is an acquisition of individuality in which neither one's own volition nor the volition of others operates. These are the four acquisitions of individuality."

When this was said, the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, I understand in detail the meaning of this statement that the Blessed One has spoken in brief to be as follows. (1) In that acquisition of individuality in which one's own volition operates but not the volition of others, it is by reason of their own volition that beings pass away from that group. ${ }^{870}$ (2) In that acquisition of individuality in which the volition of others operates but not one's own volition; it is by reason of the volition of others that beings pass away from that group. ${ }^{871}$ (3) In that acquisition of individuality in which both one's own volition and the volition of others operate, it is by reason of both one's own volition and the volition of others that beings pass away from that group. ${ }^{872}$ (4) But, Bhante, what
kind of devas should be understood as the acquisition of individuality in which neither one's own volition nor the volition of others operates?" ${ }^{873}$

"They are, Sāriputta, the devas of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception."

"Why is it, Bhante, that some beings who pass away from that group are returners, who come back to this state of being, while [160] others are non-returners, who do not come back to this state of being?" ${ }^{874}$

"Here, Sāriputta, some person has not abandoned the lower fetters. In this very life he enters and dwells in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. He relishes it, desires it, and finds satisfaction in it. If he is firm in it, focused on it; often dwells in it, and has not lost it when he dies, he is rebornin companionship with the devas in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. When he passes away from there he is a returner who comes back to this state of being.

"But some [other] person here has abandoned the lower fetters. In this very life he enters and dwells in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. He relishes it, desires it, and finds satisfaction in it. If he is firm in it; focused on it, often dwells in it, and has not lost it when he dies, he is reborn in companionship with the devas in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. When he passes away from there he is a non-returner who does not come back to this state of being.

"This, Sāriputta, is the reason some beings here who pass away from that group are returners, who come back to this state of being, while others are non-returners, who do not come back to this state of being."

# 172 (2) Analysis

There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend!" those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:

(1) "A half-month, friends, after my full ordination I realized the analytical knowledge of meaning by way of its divisions and formulation. ${ }^{875}$ In many ways I explain it, teach it, proclaim it, establish it, disclose it, analyze it, and elucidate it. ${ }^{876}$ [Let] anyone who is perplexed or uncertain [approach] me with a
question; I [will satisfy him] with my answer. ${ }^{877}$ Our teacher, who is highly skilled in our teachings, is present. ${ }^{878}$

(2) "A half-month after my full ordination I realized the analytical knowledge of the Dhamma by way of its divisions and formulation. In many ways I explain it, teach it, proclaim it, establish it, disclose it, analyze it, and elucidate it. [Let] anyone who is perplexed or uncertain [approach] me with a question; I [will satisfy him] with my answer. Our teacher, who is highly skilled in our teachings, is present.

(3) "A half-month after my full ordination I realized the analytical knowledge of language by way of its divisions and formulation. In many ways I explain it, teach it, proclaim it, establish it, disclose it, analyze it, and elucidate it. [Let] anyone who is perplexed or uncertain [approach] me with a question; I [will satisfy him] with my answer. Our teacher, who is highly skilled in our teachings, is present.

(4) "A half-month after my full ordination I realized the analytical knowledge of discernment by way of its divisions and formulation. In many ways I explain it, teach it, proclaim it, establish it, disclose it, analyze it, and elucidate it. [Let] anyone who is perplexed or uncertain [approach] me with a question; I [will satisfy him] with my answer. Our teacher, who is highly skilled in our teachings, is present." [161]

# 173 (3) Kotthita

Then the Venerable Mahākotṭhita approached the Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and asked the Venerable Sāriputta:

(1) "Friend, with the remainderless fading away and cessation of the six bases for contact, is there anything else?" ${ }^{879}$

"Do not say so, friend."

(2) "With the remainderless fading away and cessation of the six bases for contact, is there nothing else?"

"Do not say so, friend."

(3) "With the remainderless fading away and cessation of the six bases for contact, is there both something else and nothing else?"

"Do not say so, friend."

(4) "With the remainderless fading away and cessation of
the six bases for contact, is there neither something else nor nothing else?"

"Do not say so, friend. ${ }^{\text {"880 }}$

"Friend, when you are asked: 'With the remainderless fading away and cessation of the six bases for contact, is there something else?' you say: 'Do not say so, friend.' And when you are asked: 'With the remainderless fading away and cessation of the six bases for contact, is there nothing else?... Is there both something else and nothing else?... Is there neither something else nor nothing else?' [in each case] you say: 'Do not say so, friend.' In what way should the meaning of this statement be understood?"

(1) "Friend, if one says: 'With the remainderless fading away and cessation of the six bases for contact, there is something else,' one proliferates that which is not to be proliferated. ${ }^{881}$ (2) If one says: 'Friend, with the remainderless fading away and cessation of the six bases for contact, there is nothing else,' one proliferates that which is not to be proliferated. (3) If one says: 'Friend, with the remainderless fading away and cessation of the six bases for contact, there is both something else and nothing else,' one proliferates that which is not to be proliferated. (4) If one says: 'Friend, with the remainderless fading away and cessation of the six bases for contact, there is neither something else nor nothing else,' one proliferates that which is not to be proliferated.

"Friend, as far as the range of the six bases for contact extends, just so far extends the range of proliferation. ${ }^{882}$ As far as the range of proliferation extends, [162] just so far extends the range of the six bases for contact. With the remainderless fading away and cessation of the six bases for contact there is the cessation of proliferation, the subsiding of proliferation."

# 174 (4) Ānanda

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Venerable Mahākotṭhita and exchanged greetings with him.

[This sutta is exactly the same as 4:173 except that here Ānanda asks the questions and Mahākotṭhita responds.] ${ }^{883}$ [163]

## 175 (5) Upavāna

Then the Venerable Upavāṇa approached the Venerable Sāriputta . . . and said to him:
(1) "Friend Sāriputta, does one become an end-maker by means of knowledge?" ${ }^{\text {8s4 }}$

"This is not the case, friend."

(2) "Then does one become an end-maker by means of conduct?"

"This is not the case, friend."

(3) "Then does one become an end-maker by means of knowledge and conduct?"

"This is not the case, friend."

(4) "Then does one become an end-maker otherwise than by means of knowledge and conduct?"

"This is not the case, friend."

"When you are asked: 'Friend Sāriputta, does one become an end-maker by means of knowledge?' you say: 'This is not the case, friend.' When you are asked: 'Then does one become an end-maker by means of conduct?... by means of knowledge and conduct?... otherwise than by means of knowledge and conduct?' [in each case] you say: 'This is not the case, friend.' Then in what way does one become an end-maker?"

(1) "If, friend, one were to become an end-maker by means of knowledge, even one who still has clinging would become an end-maker. (2) If one were to become an end-maker by means of conduct, even one who still has clinging would become an end-maker. (3) If one were to become an end-maker by means of knowledge and conduct, even one who still has clinging would become an end-maker. (4) If one were to become an end-maker otherwise than by means of knowledge and conduct, then a worldling would be an end-maker; for a worldling is destitute of knowledge and conduct.

"Friend, one deficient in conduct does not know and see things as they are. One accomplished in conduct [164] knows and sees things as they are. Knowing and seeing things as they are, one becomes an end-maker." ${ }^{\text {"s }}{ }^{85}$

# 176 (6) Aspiring ${ }^{886}$

(1) "Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu endowed with faith, rightly aspiring, should aspire thus: 'May I become like Sāriputta and Moggallāna!' This is the standard and criterion for my bhikkhu disciples, that is, Sāriputta and Moggallāna.

(2) "Bhikkhus, a bhikkhunī endowed with faith, rightly aspiring, should aspire thus: 'May I become like the bhikkhunis

Khemā and Uppalavaṇṇā!' This is the standard and criterion for my bhikkhunī disciples, that is, the bhikkhunīs Khemā and Uppalavaṇṇā.

(3) "Bhikkhus, a male lay follower endowed with faith, rightly aspiring, should aspire thus: 'May I become like Citta the householder and Hatthaka of Ālavī!' This is the standard and criterion for my male lay disciples, that is, Citta the householder and Hatthaka of Ālavī.

(4) "Bhikkhus, a female lay follower endowed with faith, rightly aspiring, should aspire thus: 'May I become like the female lay follower Khujjuttarā and Velukaṇtakī Nandamātā!' This is the standard and criterion for my female lay disciples, that is, the female lay follower Khujjuttarā and Velukaṇtakī Nandamātā."

# 177 (7) Rāhula

Then the Venerable Rāhula approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him: ${ }^{887}$

(1) "Rāhula, the internal earth element and the external earth element are just the earth element. This should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' Having seen this thus as it really is with correct wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the earth element; one detaches the mind from the earth element. ${ }^{888}$

(2) "Rāhula, the internal water element and the external water element [165] are just the water element. This should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' Having seen this thus as it really is with correct wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the water element; one detaches the mind from the water element.

(3) "Rāhula, the internal fire element and the external fire element are just the fire element. This should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' Having seen this thus as it really is with correct wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the fire element; one detaches the mind from the fire element.

(4) "Rāhula, the internal air element and the external air element are just the air element. This should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this
is not my self.' Having seen this thus as it really is with correct wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the air element; one detaches the mind from the air element.

"When, Rāhula, a bhikkhu does not recognize a self or the belongings of a self in these four elements, he is called a bhikkhu who has cut off craving, stripped off the fetter, and by completely breaking through conceit, has made an end of suffering."

# 178 (8) The Reservoir

"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a certain peaceful liberation of mind. He attends to the cessation of personal existence. ${ }^{889}$ As he is doing so, his mind does not launch out toward it, acquire confidence, become steady, and focus on it. This bhikkhu cannot be expected to attain the cessation of personal existence. Suppose a man were to grab hold of a branch with his hand smeared with gum. His hand would stick to it, adhere to it, and be fastened to it. So too, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a certain peaceful liberation of mind... This bhikkhu cannot be expected to attain the cessation of personal existence.

(2) "Here, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a certain peaceful liberation of mind. [166] He attends to the cessation of personal existence. As he is doing so, his mind launches out toward it, acquires confidence, becomes steady, and focuses on it. This bhikkhu can be expected to attain the cessation of personal existence. Suppose a man were to grab hold of a branch with a clean hand. His hand would not stick to it, adhere to it, or be fastened to it. So too, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a certain peaceful liberation of mind. . . . This bhikkhu can be expected to attain the cessation of personal existence.

(3) "Here, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a certain peaceful liberation of mind. He attends to the breaking up of ignorance. As he is doing so, his mind does not launch out towardit, acquire confidence, become steady, and focus on it. This bhikkhu cannot be expected to attain the breaking up of ignorance. Suppose there were a reservoir many years old. A man would close off its inlets and open up its outlets, and sufficient rain would not
fall. In such a case, it could not be expected that this reservoir's embankment would break. So too, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a certain peaceful liberation of mind. . . . This bhikkhu cannot be expected to attain the breaking up of ignorance.

(4) "Here, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a certain peaceful liberation of mind. He attends to the breaking up of ignorance.

This bhikkhu can be expected to attain the breaking up of ignorance.

"These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world."

# 179 (9) Nibbāna

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Venerable Sāriputta... and said to him:

"Why is it, friend Sāriputta, that some beings do not attain nibbāna in this very life?"

"Here, friend Ānanda, [some] beings do not understand as it really is: 'These perceptions pertain to deterioration; these perceptions pertain to stabilization; these perceptions pertain to distinction; these perceptions pertain to penetration.' This is why some beings here do not attain nibbāna in this very life.

"Why is it, friend Sāriputta, that some beings here attain nibbāna in this very life?"

"Here, friend Ānanda, [some] beings understand as it really is: 'These perceptions pertain to deterioration; these perceptions pertain to stabilization; these perceptions pertain to distinction; these perceptions pertain to penetration.' This is why some beings here attain nibbāna in this very life." ${ }^{\prime 890}$

180 (10) The Great References ${ }^{891}$

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Bhoganagara near the Ananda Shrine. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!'

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you these four great references. ${ }^{892}$ [168] Listen and attend closely; I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"What, bhikkhus, are the four great references?

(1) "Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu might say: 'In the presence of the Blessed One I heard this; in his presence I learned this: "This is the Dhamma; this is the discipline; this is the Teacher's teaching!" That bhikkhu's statement should neither be approved nor rejected. Without approving or rejecting it, you should thoroughly learn those words and phrases and then check for them in the discourses and seek them in the discipline. ${ }^{893}$ If, when you check for them in the discourses and seek them in the discipline, [you find that] they are not included among the discourses and are not to be seen in the discipline, you should draw the conclusion: 'Surely, this is not the word of the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. It has been badly learned by this bhikkhu.' Thus you should discard it.

"But a bhikkhu might say: 'In the présence of the Blessed One I heard this; in his presence I learned this: "This is the Dhamma; this is the discipline; this is the Teacher's teaching!" That bhikkhu's statement should neither be approved nor rejected. Without approving or rejecting it, you should thoroughly learn those words and phrases and then check for them in the discourses and seek them in the discipline. If, when you check for them in the discourses and seek them in the discipline, [you find that] they are included among the discourses and are to be seen in the discipline, you should draw the conclusion: 'Surely, this is the word of the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. It has been learned well by this bhikkhu.' You should remember this first great reference.

(2) "Then a bhikkhu might say: 'In such and such a residence a Sangha is dwelling with elders and prominent monks. In the presence of that Sangha I heard this; in its presence I learned this:

"But...if, when you check for them in the discourses and seek them in the discipline, [you find that] they are included among the discourses and are to be seen in the discipline, you should draw the conclusion: 'Surely, this is the word of the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One.

It has been learned well by those elders.' You should remember this third great reference.
(4) "Then a bhikkhu might say: 'In such and such a residence one elder bhikkhu is dwelling [170] who is learned, an heir to the heritage, an expert on the Dhamma, an expert on the discipline, an expert on the outlines.

## 181 (1) Warrior

"Bhikkhus, possessing four factors, a warrior is worthy of a king, an accessory of a king, and reckoned a factor of kingship. What four? Here, a warrior is skilled in places, a long-distance shooter, a sharp-shooter, and one who splits a great body.

Possessing these four factors, a warrior is worthy of a king, an accessory of a king, and reckoned a factor of kingship. [171] So too, possessing four factors, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What four? Here, a bhikkhu is skilled in places, a long-distance shooter, a sharp-shooter, and one who splits a great body.

(1) "And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu skilled in places? Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. It is in this way that a bhikkhu is skilled in places.

(2) "And how is a bhikkhu a long-distance shooter? Here, any kind of form whatsoever-whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near-a bhikkhu sees all form as it really is with correct wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' Any kind of feeling whatsoever . . . Any kind of perception whatsoever . . . Any kind of volitional activities whatsoever . . . Any kind of consciousness whatsoever-whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near-a bhikkhu sees all consciousness as it really is with correct wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' It is in this way that a bhikkhu is a long-distance shooter.

(3) "And how is a bhikkhu a sharp-shooter? Here, a bhikkhu understands as it really is: 'This is suffering.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the origin of suffering.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the cessation of suffering.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' It is in this way that a bhikkhu is a sharp-shooter.

(4) "And how is a bhikkhu one who splits a great body? Here, a bhikkhu splits the great mass of ignorance. It is in this way that a bhikkhu is one who splits a great body.

"Possessing these four qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world." [172]

# 182 (2) Guarantor

"Bhikkhus, against four things there can be no guarantor, neither an ascetic, a brahmin, a deva, Māra, Brahmā, nor anyone in the world. What four?
(1) "There can be no guarantor, neither an ascetic ... nor anyone in the world, that what is subject to old age will not grow old.

(2) "There can be no guarantor, neither an ascetic ... nor anyone in the world, that what is subject to illness will not fall ill.

(3) "There can be no guarantor, neither an ascetic ... nor anyone in the world, that what is subject to death will not die.

(4) "There can be no guarantor, neither an ascetic... nor anyone in the world, that bad kamma-defiled, conducive to renewed existence, troublesome, ripening in suffering, leading to future birth, old age, and death-will not produce its result.

"Against these four things, bhikkhus, there can be no guarantor, neither an ascetic, a brahmin, a deva, Māra, Brahmā, nor anyone in the world."

# 183 (3) Heard

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. Then the brahmin Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him.... Then, sitting to one side, he said to the Blessed One:

"Master Gotama, I hold the thesis and view that there is no fault when one speaks about the seen, saying: 'Such was seen by me'; no fault when one speaks about the heard, saying: 'Such was heard by me'; no fault when one speaks about the sensed, saying: 'Such was sensed by me'; no fault when one speaks about the cognized, saying: 'Such was cognized by me.'"

(1) "I do not say, brahmin, that everything seen should be spoken about, nor do I say that nothing seen should be spoken about. (2) I do not say that everything heard should be spoken about, nor do I say that nothing heard [173] should be spoken about. (3) I do not say that everything sensed should be spoken about, nor do I say that nothing sensed should be spoken about. (4) I do not say that everything cognized should be spoken about, nor do I say that nothing cognized should be spoken about.

(1) "For, brahmin, if, when one speaks about what one has seen, unwholesome qualities increase and wholesome qualities decline, I say that one should not speak about what one has seen. But if, when one speaks about what one has seen, unwholesome
qualities decline and wholesome qualities increase, I say that one should speak about what one has seen. ${ }^{895}$

(2) "If, when one speaks about what one has heard, unwholesome qualities increase and wholesome qualities decline, I say that one should not speak about what one has heard. But if, when one speaks about what one has heard, unwholesome qualities decline and wholesome qualities increase, I say that one should speak about what one has heard.

(3) "If, when one speaks about what one has sensed, unwholesome qualities increase and wholesome qualities decline, I say that one should not speak about what one has sensed. But if, when one speaks about what one has sensed, unwholesome qualities decline and wholesome qualities increase, I say that one should speak about what one has sensed.

(4) "If, when one speaks about what one has cognized, unwholesome qualities increase and wholesome qualities decline, I say that one should not speak about what one has cognized. But if, when one speaks about what one has cognized, unwholesome qualities decline and wholesome qualities increase, I say that one should speak about what one has cognized."

Then the brahmin Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One's statement, rose from his seat and departed.

# 184 (4) Fearless

Then the brahmin Jānussonī approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him.... Then, sitting to one side, he said to the Blessed One:

"Master Gotama, I hold the thesis and view that there is no one subject to death who is not frightened and terrified of death."

"Brahmin, there are those subject to death that are frightened and terrified of death, but there are also those subject to death that are not frightened and terrified of death.

"And, brahmin, who are those subject to death that are frightened and terrified of death?

(1) "Here, someone is not devoid of lust, desire, [174] affection, thirst, passion, and craving for sensual pleasures. When he incurs a severe and debilitating illness, he thinks: 'Alas, the sen-
sual pleasures dear to me will leave me, and I will have to leave those sensual pleasures.' He sorrows, languishes, and laments; he weeps beating his breast and becomes confused. This is one subject to death who is frightened and terrified of death.

(2) "Again, someone is not devoid of lust, desire, affection, thirst, passion, and craving for the body. When he incurs a severe and debilitating illness, he thinks: 'Alas, this body dear to me will leave me, and I will have to leave this body.' He sorrows, languishes, and laments; he weeps beating his breast and becomes confused. This, too, is one subject to death who is. frightened and terrified of death.

(3) "Again, someone has not done what is good and wholesome or made a shelter for himself, but he has done what is evil, cruel, and defiled. When he incurs a severe and debilitating illness, he thinks: 'Alas, I have not done anything good and wholesome, nor have I made a shelter for myself, but I have done what is evil, cruel, and defiled. When I pass on, I will meet the appropriate fate.' He sorrows, languishes, and laments; he weeps beating his breast and becomes confused. This, too, is one subject to death who is frightened and terrified of death.

(4) "Again, someone here is perplexed, doubtful, and undecided about the good Dhamma. When he incurs a severe and debilitating illness, he thinks: 'Alas, I am perplexed, doubtful, and undecided about the good Dhamma.' He sorrows, languishes, and laments; he weeps beating his breast and becomes confused. This, too, is one subject to death who is frightened and terrified of death.

"These are four subject to death that are frightened and terrified of death. [175]

"And, brahmin, who are those subject to death that are not frightened and terrified of death?

(1) "Here, someone is devoid of lust, desire, affection, thirst, passion, and craving for sensual pleasures. When he incurs a severe and debilitating illness, he does not think: 'Alas, the sensual pleasures dear to me will leave me, and I will have to leave those sensual pleasures.' He does not sorrow, languish, and lament; he does not weep beating his breast and become confused. This is one subject to death who is not frightened and terrified of death.

(2) "Again, someone is devoid of lust, desire, affection, thirst,
passion, and craving for the body. When he incurs a severe and debilitating illness, he does not think: 'Alas, this body dear to me will leave me, and I will have to leave this body.' He does not sorrow, languish, and lament; he does not weep beating his breast and become confused. This, too, is one subject to death who is not frightened and terrified of death.

(3) "Again, someone has not done what is evil, cruel, and defiled, but has done what is good and wholesome and made a shelter for himself. When he incurs a severe and debilitating illness, he thinks: 'Indeed, I have not done anything evil, cruel, and defiled, but I have done what is good and wholesome and made a shelter for myself. When I pass on, I will meet the appropriate fate.' He does not sorrow, languish, and lament; he does not weep beating his breast and become confused. This, too, is one subject to death who is not frightened and terrified of death.

(4) "Again, someone is unperplexed, doubt-free, and decided about the good Dhamma. When he incurs a severe and debilitating illness, he thinks: 'I am unperplexed, doubt-free, and decided about the good Dhamma.' He does not sorrow, languish, and lament; he does not weep beating his breast and become confused. [176] This, too, is one subject to death who is not frightened and terrified of death.

"These, brahmin, are four subject to death that are not frightened and terrified of death."

"Excellent, Master Gotama! ... [as at 4:100] ... Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

# 185 (5) Brahmin Truths

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Now on that occasion a number of very well-known wanderers were residing at the wanderers' park on the bank of the river Sappini, that is, Annabhāra, Varadhara, Sakuludāyī, and other very well-known wanderers. Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and went to the wanderers' park on the bank of the river Sappini. Now on that occasion the wanderers of other sects had assembled and were sitting together when this conversation arose: "Such are the brahmin truths, such are the brahmin truths."

Then the Blessed One approached those wanderers, sat down
on a seat that was prepared, and asked them: "Wanderers, what discussion were you engaged in just now? What was the conversation that was underway?"

"Here, Master Gotama, we had assembled and were sitting together when this conversation arose: 'Such are the brahmin truths, such are the brahmin truths.'"

"Wanderers, there are these four brahmin truths that I have proclaimed, having realized them for myself with direct knowledge. What four?

(1) "Here, wanderers, a brahmin says thus: 'All living beings are to be spared.' Speaking thus, a brahmin speaks truth, not falsehood. He does not, on that account, misconceive himself as 'an ascetic' or as 'a brahmin.' He does not misconceive: 'I am better' or 'I am equal' or 'I am worse.' Rather, having directly known the truth in that, he is practicing simply out of sympathy and compassion for living beings.

(2) "Again, a brahmin says thus: [177]'All sensual pleasures are impermanent, suffering, and subject to change.' Speaking thus, a brahmin speaks truth, not falsehood. He does not, on that account, misconceive himself as 'an ascetic' or as 'a brahmin.' He does not misconceive: 'I am better' or 'I am equal' or 'I am worse.' Rather, having directly known the truth in that, he is practicing simply for disenchantment with sensual pleasures, for their fading away and cessation.

(3) "Again, a brahmin says thus: 'All states of existence are impermanent, suffering, and subject to change.' Speaking thus, a brahmin speaks truth, not falsehood. He does not, on that account, misconceive himself as 'an ascetic' or as 'a brahmin.' He does not misconceive: 'I am better' or 'I am equal' or 'I am worse.' Rather, having directly known the truth in that, he is practicing simply for disenchantment with states of existence, for their fading away and cessation.

(4) "Again, wanderers, a brahmin says thus: 'I am not anywhere the belonging of anyone, nor is there anywhere anything in any place that is mine. ${ }^{1986}$ Speaking thus, a brahmin speaks truth, not falsehood. He does not, on that account, misconceive himself as 'an ascetic' or as 'a brahmin.' He does not misconceive: 'I am better' or 'I am equal' or 'I am worse.' Rather, having directly known the truth in that, he is practicing the path of nothingness. ${ }^{897}$

"These, wanderers, are the four brahmin truths that I have
proclaimed, having realized them for myself with direct knowledge."

# 186 (6) Acumen

Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One . . . and said to him:

(1) "Bhante, by what is the world led? By what is the world dragged around? When what has arisen does [the world] go under its control?"898

"Good, good, bhikkhu! Your acumen is excellent. Your discernment is excellent. ${ }^{899}$ Your inquiry is a good one. For you have asked thus: 'Bhante, by what is the world led? By what is the world dragged around? When what has arisen does [the world] go under its control?'"

"Yes, Bhante."

"The world, bhikkhu, is led by the mind; it is dragged around by the mind; when the mind has arisen, [the world] goes under its control." [178]

Saying, "Good, Bhante," that bhikkhu delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One's statement. Then he asked the Blessed One a further question:

(2) "It is said, Bhante, 'a learned expert on the Dhamma, a learned expert on the Dhamma.' In what way is one a learned expert on the Dhamma?"

"Good, good, bhikkhu! Your acumen is excellent. Your discernment is excellent. Your inquiry is a good one. For you have asked thus: 'It is said, Bhante, "a learned expert on the Dhamma, a learned expert on the Dhamma." In what way is one a learned expert on the Dhamma?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"I have taught many teachings, bhikkhu: discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts, and questions-andanswers. If, after learning the meaning and Dhamma of even a four-line verse, one practices in accordance with the Dhamma, that is enough for one to be called 'a learned expert on the Dhamma.'"

Saying, "Good, Bhante," that bhikkhu delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One's statement. Then he asked the Blessed One a further question:

(3) "It is said, Bhante, 'learned, of penetrative wisdom;
learned, of penetrative wisdom.' In what way is one learned, of penetrative wisdom?"

"Good, good, bhikkhu! Your acumen is excellent. Your discernment is excellent. Your inquiry is a good one. For you have asked thus: 'It is said, Bhante, "learned, of penetrative wisdom; learned, of penetrative wisdom." In what way is one learned, of penetrative wisdom?'"

"Yes, Bhante."

"Here, bhikkhu, a bhikkhu has heard: 'This is suffering,' and he sees the meaning of this, having pierced through it with wisdom. He has heard: 'This is the origin of suffering,' and he sees the meaning of this, having pierced through it with wisdom. He has heard: 'This is the cessation of suffering,' and he sees the meaning of this, having pierced through it with wisdom. He has heard: 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering,' and he sees the meaning of this, having pierced through it with wisdom. It is in this way that one is learned, of penetrative wisdom."

Saying, "Good, Bhante," that bhikkhu delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One's statement. Then he asked the Blessed One a further question:

(4) "It is said, Bhante, 'a wise person of great wisdom, a wise person of great wisdom.' In what way is one a wise person of great wisdom?" [179]

"Good, good, bhikkhu! Your acumen is excellent. Your discernment is excellent. Your inquiry is a good one. For you have asked thus: 'It is said, Bhante, "a wise person of great wisdom, a wise person of great wisdom." In what way is one a wise person of great wisdom?'"

"Yes, Bhante."

"Here, bhikkhu, a wise person of great wisdom does not intend for his own affliction, or for the affliction of others, or for the affliction of both. Rather, when he thinks, he thinks only of his own welfare, the welfare of others, the welfare of both, and the welfare of the whole world. ${ }^{900}$ It is in this way that one is a wise person of great wisdom."

# 187 (7) Vassakāra

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. Then the brahmin Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, approached the

Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him.... Then, sitting to one side, he said to the Blessed One:

(1) "Master Gotama, can a bad person know of a bad person: 'This fellow is a bad person'?"

"It is, brahmin, impossible and inconceivable that a bad person can know of a bad person: 'This fellow is a bad person.'"

(2) "Then can a bad person know of a good person: 'This fellow is a good person'?"

"It is also impossible and inconceivable that a bad person can know of a good person: 'This fellow is a good person.'"

(3) "Then can a good person know of a good person: 'This fellow is a good person'?"

"It is possible that a good person can know of a good person: 'This fellow is a good person.'"

(4) "Then can a good person know of a bad person: 'This fellow is a bad person'?"

"It is also possible that a good person can know of a bad person: 'This fellow is a bad person.'"

"It is astounding and amazing, Master Gotama, how [180] well this has been stated by Master Gotama: 'It is, brahmin, impossible and inconceivable that a bad person can know of a bad person ... [all as above] . . It is also possible that a good person can know of a bad person: "This fellow is a bad person."'

"On one occasion, Master Gotama, the members of the brahmin Todeyya's assembly were carping against others, [saying]: 'This King Eleyya is a fool, for he has complete confidence in the ascetic Rāmaputta and shows him supreme honor by paying homage to him, rising up for him, reverentially saluting him, and observing proper etiquette toward him. ${ }^{901}$ These vassals of King Eleyya-Yamaka, Moggalla, Ugga, Nāvindakī, Gandhabba, and Aggivessa-are fools as well, for they, too, have complete confidence in the ascetic Rāmaputta and show him supreme honor by paying homage to him, rising up for him, reverentially saluting him, and observing proper etiquette toward him.' Thereupon the brahmin Todeyya led them around by this method: 'What do you think, sirs, in matters pertaining to tasks and administrative duties, to edicts and proclamations, isn't King Eleyya wise and more astute even than those who are very astute?'

"[They replied:]'Yes, sir, in matters pertaining to tasks and
administrative duties, to edicts and proclamations, King Eleyya is wise and more astute even than those who are very astute.'

"But, sirs,' [he said,] 'it is because the ascetic Rāmaputta is wiser than the wise King Eleyya, more astute than this astute [king] in matters pertaining to tasks and administrative duties, to edicts and proclamations, that King Eleyya has complete confidence in him and shows him supreme honor by paying homage to him, rising up for him, reverentially saluting him, and observing proper etiquette toward him.

"What do you think, sirs, in matters pertaining to tasks and administrative duties, to edicts and proclamations, are King Eleyya's vassals-Yamaka, Moggalla, [181] Ugga, Nāvindakī, Gandhabba, Aggivessa-wise and more astute even than those who are very astute?'

"Yes, sir, in matters pertaining to tasks and administrative duties, to edicts and proclamations, King Eleyya's vassalsYamaka...Aggivessa-are wise and more astute even than those who are very astute.'

"But, sirs, it is because the ascetic Rāmaputta is wiser than King Eleyya's vassals, more astute than those astute [vassals] in matters pertaining to tasks and administrative duties, to edicts and proclamations, that King Eleyya's vassals have complete confidence in him and show him supreme honor by paying homage to him, rising up for him, reverentially saluting him, and observing proper etiquette toward him." ${ }^{\prime \prime 92}$

"It is astounding and amazing, Master Gotama, how well this has been stated by Master Gotama: 'It is impossible and inconceivable that a bad person can know of a bad person: "This fellow is a bad person." It is also impossible and inconceivable that a bad person can know of a good person: "This fellow is a good person." It is possible that a good person can know of a good person: "This fellow is a good person." It is also possible that a good person can know of a bad person: "This fellow is a bad person." And now, Master Gotama, we must be going. We are busy and have much to do."

"You may go, brahmin, at your own convenience."

Then the brahmin Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One's statement, rose from his seat and departed:

188 (8) Upaka

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Then Upaka Mandikāputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:

"Bhante, I hold such a thesis and view as this: If anyone carps against others and does not at all substantiate it, he is blameworthy and at fault."

"If, Upaka, anyone carping against others does not substantiate it, [182] he is blameworthy and at fault. But you carp against others and do not substantiate it, so you are blameworthy and at fault."

"Bhante, just as one might catch [a fish] emerging [from the water] with a large snare, just so, when I emerged, the Blessed One caught me with a large snare in debate."

(1) "Upaka, I have proclaimed: 'This is unwholesome.' The Tathāgata has unlimited Dhamma teachings about this, with unlimited words and phrases, [declaring]: 'For such and such reasons, this is unwholesome.'

(2) "Upaka, I have proclaimed: 'That which is unwholesome should be abandoned.' The Tathāgata has unlimited Dhamma teachings about this, with unlimited words and phrases, [declaring]: 'For such and such reasons, that which is unwholesome should be abandoned.'

(3) "Upaka, I have proclaimed: 'This is wholesome.' The Tathāgata has unlimited Dhamma teachings about this, with unlimited words and phrases, [declaring]: 'For such and such reasons, this is wholesome.'

(4) "Upaka, I have proclaimed: 'That which is wholesome should be developed.' The Tathāgata has unlimited Dhamma teachings about this, with unlimited words and phrases, [declaring]: 'For such and such reasons, that which is wholesome should be developed." "

Then Upaka Mandikāputta, having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One's statement, rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, and circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him. He then went to King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha and reported to the king his entire conversation with the Blessed One.

When he had spoken, King Ajātasattu became angry and dis-
pleased and said to Upaka Mandikāputta: "How bold indeed is this salt-maker's boy! How rude, how impudent, in that he thinks he can attack the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. Go away, Upaka, be gone! Get out of my sight!"

# 189 (9) Realization

"Bhikkhus, there are these four things to be realized. What four? [183]

"There are things to be realized by the body; there are things to be realized by memory; there are things to be realized by the eye; there are things to be realized by wisdom.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, are the things to be realized by the body? The eight emancipations, bhikkhus, are to be realized by the body. (2) And what are the things to be realized by memory? One's past abodes are to be realized by memory, (3) And what are the things to be realized by the eye? The passing away and rebirth of beings are to be realized by the eye. (4) And what are the things to be realized by wisdom? The destruction of the taints is to be realized by wisdom.

"These, bhikkhus, are the four things to be realized."

## 190 (10) Uposatha

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Migāramātā's Mansion in the Eastern Park. Now on that occasion, on the day of the uposatha, the Blessed One was sitting surrounded by the Sangha of bhikkhus. Then, having surveyed the utterly silent Sangha of bhikkhus, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:

"Bhikkhus, this assembly is free from prattle; this assembly is without prattle, pure, established in the core. Such a Sangha of bhikkhus, such an assembly, is rarely seen in the world. Such a Sangha of bhikkhus, such an assembly, is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. Even a little given to such a Sangha of bhikkhus, to such an assembly, becomes plentiful, while much given to it becomes even more plentiful. Such a Sangha of bhikkhus, such an assembly, is worth traveling many yojanas to see, even with a shoulder bag. Such is this Sangha of bhikkhus. [184]
"There are bhikkhus in this Sangha who dwell having attained the state of devas. There are bhikkhus in this Sangha who dwell having attained the state of brahmās. There are bhikkhus in this Sangha who dwell having attained the imperturbable. There are bhikkhus in this Sangha who dwell having attained the state of noble ones.

(1) "And how has a bhikkhu attained the state of a deva? Here, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. With the subsiding of thought and examination, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration, without thought and examination. With the fading away as well of rapture, he dwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, he experiences pleasure with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: 'He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.' With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has attained the state of a deva.

(2) "And how has a bhikkhu attained the state of a brahmā? Here, a bhikkhu dwells pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, likewise the second quarter, the third quarter, and the fourth quarter. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will. He dwells pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with compassion... with a mind imbued with altruistic joy . . . with a mind imbued with equanimity, likewise the second quarter, the third quarter, and the fourth quarter. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with equanimity, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has attained the state of a brahmā.

(3) "And how has a bhikkhu attained the imperturbable?

Here, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, [perceiving] 'space is infinite,' a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of space. By completely surmounting the base of the infinity of space, [perceiving] 'consciousness is infinite,' he enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of consciousness. By completely surmounting the base of the infinity of consciousness, [perceiving] 'there is nothing,' he enters and dwells in the base of nothingness. By completely surmounting the base of nothingness; he enters and dwells in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has attained the imperturbable.

(4) "And how has a bhikkhu attained the state of a noble one? Here, a bhikkhui understands as it really is: 'This is suffering.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the origin of suffering.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the cessation of suffering.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' It is in this way that a bhikkhu has attained the state of a noble one." [185]

# V. The Great Chapter

## 191 (1) Followed by Ear

"Bhikkhus, when one has followed the teachings by ear, ${ }^{903}$ recited them verbally, examined them with the mind, and penetrated them well by view, four benefits are to be expected. What four?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu masters the Dhamma: discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts, and questions-andanswers. He has followed those teachings by ear, recited them verbally, examined them with the mind, and penetrated them well by view. He passes away muddled in mind and is reborn into a certain group of devas. There, the happy ones recite passages of the Dhamma to him. ${ }^{94}$ The arising of his memory is sluggish, but then that being quickly reaches distinction. This is the first benefit to be expected when one has followed the teachings by ear, recited them verbally, examined them with the mind, and penetrated them well by view.
(2) "Again, a bhikkhu masters the Dhamma: discourses ... and questions-and-answers. He has followed those teachings by ear, recited them verbally, examined them with the mind, and penetrated them well by view. He passes away muddled in mind and is reborn into a certain group of devas. There, the happy ones do not recite passages of the Dhamma to him, but a bhikkhu with psychic potency who has attained mastery of mind teaches the Dhamma to an assembly of devas. It occurs to him: 'This is the Dhamma and discipline in which I formerly lived the spiritual life.' The arising of his memory is sluggish, but then that being quickly reaches distinction. Suppose a man were skilled in the sound of a kettledrum: While traveling along a highway he might hear the sound of a kettledrum and would not be at all perplexed or uncertain about the sound; rather, he would conclude: 'That is the sound of a kettledrum.' So too, a bhikkhu masters the Dhamma [186]... The arising of his memory is sluggish, but then that being quickly reaches distinction. This is the second benefit to be expected when one has followed the teachings by ear, recited them verbally, examined them with the mind, and penetrated them well by view.

(3) "Again, a bhikkhu masters the Dhamma: discourses ... and questions-and-answers. He has followed those teachings by ear, recited them verbally, examined them with the mind, and penetrated them well by view. He passes away muddled in mind and is reborn into a certain group of devas. There, the happy ones do not recite passages of the Dhamma to him, nor does a bhikkhu with psychic potency who has attained mastery of mind teach the Dhamma to an assembly of devas. However, a young deva teaches the Dhamma to an assembly of devas. It occurs to him: 'This is the Dhamma and discipline in which I formerly lived the spiritual life.' The arising of his memory is sluggish, but then that being quickly reaches distinction. Suppose a man were skilled in the soūnd of a conch. While traveling along a highway he might hear the sound of a conch and he would not be at all perplexed or uncertain about the sound; rather, he would conclude: 'That is the sound of a conch.' So too, a bhikkhu masters the Dhamma... The arising of his memory is sluggish, but then that being quickly reaches distinction. This is the third benefit to be expected when one has followed the teachings by ear, recited them verbally, examined them with the mind, and penetrated them well by view.

The other says: 'I remember, dear sir. I remember.' The arising of his memory is sluggish, but then that being quickly reaches distinction. Suppose there were two friends who had played together in the mud. By chance they would meet one another later in life. Then one friend would say to the other: 'Do you remember this, friend?

# 192 (2) Facts

"Bhikkhus, four facts [about people] can be known from four [other] facts. What four?

(1) "By dwelling together their virtuous behavior can be known, and this only after a long time, not casually; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; and by one who is wise, not by one who is unwise.

(2) "By dealing [with them] their integrity can be known, and this only after a long time, not casually; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; and by one who is wise, not by one who is unwise.

(3) "In misfortune their fortitude can be known, and this only
after a long time; not casually; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; and by one who is wise, not by one who is unwise.

(4) "By conversation their wisdom can be known, and this only after a long time, not casually; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; and by one who is wise, not by one who is unwise.

(1) "It was said: 'By dwelling together their virtuous behavior can be known, and this only after a long time, not casually; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; and by one who is wise, not by one who is unwise.' On account of what was this said?

"Here, bhikkhus, by dwelling together with another person, one comes to know him thus: 'For a long time this venerable one's conduct has been broken, flawed, blemished, and blotched, and he does not consistently observe and follow virtuous behavior. This venerable one is immoral, not virtuous.'

"But in another case, by dwelling together with another person, one comes to know him thus: 'For a long time this venerable one's conduct has been unbroken, flawless, unblemished, and unblotched, [188] and he consistently observes and follows virtuous behavior. This venerable one is virtuous, not immoral.'

"It was on account of this that it was said: 'By dwelling together their virtuous behavior can be known, and this only after a long time, not casually; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; and by one who is wise, not by one who is unwise.'

"Here, bhikkhus, when dealing with a person, one comes to know him thus: 'This venerable one deals with one person in one way, in another way if he deals with two, in still another way if he deals with three, and in still another way if he deals with many. His dealings in one case deviate from his dealings in another. ${ }^{995}$ This venerable one is impure in his dealings with others, not pure in such dealings.'
"But in another case, when dealing with a person, one comes to know him thus: 'In the same way as he deals with one, he deals with two, three, or many. His dealings in one case do not deviate from his dealings in another. This venerable one is pure in his dealings with others, not impure in such dealings.'

"It was on account of this that it was said: 'By dealing [with them] their integrity can be known, and this only after a long time, not casually; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; and by one who is wise, not by one who is unwise.'

"Here, bhikkhus, someone is afflicted with the loss of relatives, wealth, or health, but he does not reflect thus: 'Human life in the world is of such a nature ${ }^{906}$ that the eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and the world revolves. around these eight worldly conditions, namely, gain and loss, disrepute and fame, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain.' Thus when afflicted with loss of relatives, wealth, or health, he sorrows, languishes, and laments; he weeps beating his breast and becomes confused.

"Here, bhikkhus, when conversing with someone, one comes to know: 'Judging from the way this venerable one initiates, formulates, and poses a question, he is unwise, not wise. For what reason? This venerable one does not speak about matters that are deep, peaceful, sublime, beyond the sphere of reasoning, subtle, comprehensible to the wise. When this venerable one speaks on the Dhamma, he is not able to explain, teach, describe, establish, reveal, analyze, and explicate its meaning either briefly or in detail. This venerable one is unwise, not wise.' Just as if a man with good sight, standing on the bank of a pond, were to see a small fish emerging, he would think: 'Judging from the way this fish emerges, from the ripples it makes; and from its force, this is a small fish, not a big one,' so too; when conversing with a person, one comes to know: 'Judging from the way this venerable one initiates, formulates, and poses a question, he is unwise, not wise.'

"These, bhikkhus, are the four facts [about people] that can be known from four [other] facts."

193 (3) Bhaddiya

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then Bhaddiya the Licchavi approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Bhante, I have heard this: 'The ascetic Gotama is a magician who knows a converting magic by which he converts the disciples of teachers of other sects.' Do those who speak thus state what has been said by the Blessed One and not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact? Do they explain in accordance with the Dhamma so that they do not incur any reasonable criticism or ground for censure? For we do not want to misrepresent the Blessed One. ${ }^{\prime 997}$ [191]

"Come, Bhaddiya, do not go by oral tradition, by lineage of teaching, by hearsay, by a collection of scriptures, by logical reasoning, by inferential reasoning, by reasoned cogitation, by the acceptance of a view after pondering it, by the seeming competence [of a speaker], or because you think: 'The ascetic is our guru.' But when you know for yourself: 'These things are unwholesome; these things are blameworthy; these things are censured by the wise; these things, if accepted and undertaken, lead to harm and suffering,' then you should abandon them. ${ }^{998}$

(1) "What do you think, Bhaddiya? When greed arises in a person, is it for his welfare or for his harm?"

"For his harm, Bhante."

"Bhaddiya, a greedy person, overcome by greed, with mind obsessed by it, destroys life, takes what is not given, transgresses with another's wife, and speaks falsehood; and he encourages others to do likewise. Will that lead to his harm and suffering for a long time?"

"Yes, Bhante."

(2) "What do you think, Bhaddiya? When hatred . . (3) . . . delusion...(4) . . . vehemence arises in a person, is it for his welfare or for his harm?"999

"For his harm, Bhante."

"Bhaddiya, a vehement person, overcome and with mind obsessed by vehemence, destroys life ... and he encourages others to do likewise. Will that lead to his harm and suffering for a long time?"
"Yes, Bhante."

"What do you think, Bhaddiya? Are these things wholesome or unwholesome?" - "Unwholesome, Bhante." - "Blameworthy or blameless?" - "Blameworthy, Bhante." - "Censured or praised by the wise?" - "Censured by the wise, Bhante." "Accepted and undertaken, do they lead to harm and suffering or not, or how do you take it?" - "Accepted and undertaken, these things lead to harm and suffering. So we take it."

"Thus, Bhaddiya, when we said: 'Come, Bhaddiya, do not go by oral tradition...[192] ... But when you know for yourself: "These things are unwholesome; these things are blameworthy; these things are censured by the wise; these things, if undertaken and practiced, lead to harm and suffering," then you should abandon them,' it is because of this that this was said.

"Come, Bhaddiya, do not go by oral tradition, by lineage of teaching; by hearsay, by a collection of texts, by logical reasoning, by inferential reasoning, by reasoned cogitation, by the acceptance of a view after pondering it, by the seeming competence [of a speaker], or because you think: 'The ascetic is our guru.' But when you know for yourself: 'These things are wholesome; these things are blameless; these things are praised by the wise; these things, if accepted and undertaken, lead to welfare and happiness,' then you should live in accordance with them.

(1) "What do you think, Bhaddiya? When non-greed arises in a person, is it for his welfare or for his harm?"

"For his welfare, Bhante."

"Bhaddiya, a person without greed, not overcome by greed, his mind not obsessed by it, does not destroy life, take what is not given, transgress with another's wife, or speak falsehood; nor does he encourage others to do likewise. Will that lead to his welfare and happiness for a long time?"

"Yes, Bhante."

(2) "What do you think, Bhaddiya? When non-hatred... (3) . . non-delusion... (4) . . non-vehemence arises in a person, is it for his welfare or his harm?"

"For his welfare, Bhante."

"Bhaddiya, a non-vehement person, not overcome by vehemence, his mind not obsessed by it, does not destroy life . . . nor does he encourage others to do likewise. Will that lead to his welfare and happiness for a long time?"
"Yes, Bhante."

"What do you think, Bhaddiya? Are these things wholesome or unwholesome?" - "Wholesome, Bhante." - "Blameworthy or blameless?" - "Blameless, Bhante." - "Censured or praised by the wise?" - "Praised by the wise, Bhante." [193] - "Accepted and undertaken, do they lead to welfare and happiness or not, or how do you take it?" - "Accepted and undertaken, these things lead to welfare and happiness. So we take it."

"Thus, Bhaddiya, when we said: 'Come, Bhaddiya, do not go by oral tradition... But when you know for yourself: "These things are wholesome; these things are blameless; these things are praised by the wise; these things, if accepted and undertaken, lead to welfare and happiness," then you should live in accordance with them,' it is because of this that this was said.

"Bhaddiya, the good persons in the world encourage their disciples thus: 'Come, good man, you should constantly remove. greed. ${ }^{910}$ When you constantly remove greed, you will not do any action born of greed, whether by body, speech, or mind. You should constantly remove hatred. When you constantly remove hatred, you will not do any action born of hatred, whether by body, speech, or mind. You should constantly remove delusion. When you constantly remove delusion, you will not do any action born of delusion, whether by body, speech, or mind. You should constantly remove vehemence. When you constantly remove vehemence, you will not do any action born of vehemence, whether by body, speech, or mind.'"

When this was said, Bhaddiya the Licchavi said to the Blessed One: "Excellent, Bhante! . . [as at 4:111] . . . Let the Blessed One consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

"Now, Bhaddiya, did I say to you: 'Come, Bhaddiya, be my disciple and I will be your teacher?'"

"Surely not, Bhante."

"But, Bhaddiya, though I speak thus and declare [my teaching] in such a way, some ascetics and brahmins untruthfully, baselessly, falsely, and wrongly misrepresent me when they say: 'The ascetic Gotama is a magician who knows a converting magic by which he converts the disciples of teachers of other sects.'" [194]

"Excellent is that converting magic, Bhante! Good is that converting magic! If my beloved relatives and family members
would be converted by this conversion, that would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time. If all khattiyas would be converted by this conversion, that would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time. If all brahmins . . . vessas . . . suddas would be converted by this conversion, that would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time. ${ }^{\prime \prime 91}$

"So it is, Bhaddiya, so it is! If all khattiyas would be converted by this conversion toward the abandoning of unwholesome qualities and the acquisition of wholesome qualities, that would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time. If all brahmins . . . vessas . . . suddas would be converted by this conversion toward the abandoning of unwholesome qualities and the acquisition of wholesome qualities, that would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time. If the world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, would be converted by this conversion toward the abandoning of unwholesome qualities and the acquisition of wholesome qualities, that would lead to the welfare and happiness of the world for a long time. If these great sal trees would be converted by this conversion toward the abandoning of unwholesome qualities and the acquisition of wholesome qualities, that would lead to the welfare and happiness even of these great sal trees for a long time, if they could choose. ${ }^{912}$ How much more then for a human being!"

# 194 (4) Sāpūga

On one occasion the Venerable Ānanda was dwelling among the Koliyans near the Koliyan town named Sāpūga. Then a number of young Koliyans from Sāpūga approached the Venerable Ānanda, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Venerable Ananda then said to them:

"Byagghapajjas, there are these four factors of striving for purity ${ }^{913}$ that the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, knowing and seeing, [195] has rightly expounded for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and dejection, for the achievement of the method, for the realization of nibbāna. What four? The factor of striving for purity of virtuous behavior, the factor of striving for purity of mind, the factor of striving for purity of view, and the factor of striving for purity of liberation. ${ }^{914}$
(1) "And what, Byagghapajjas, is the factor of striving for purity of virtuous behavior? Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous... [as at $4: 181] \ldots$ he trains in them. This is called purity of virtuous behavior. The desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension [applied with the intention]: 'In just such a way I will fulfill purity of virtuous behavior that I have not yet fulfilled or assist with wisdom in various respects purity of virtuous behavior that I have fulfilled ${ }^{\prime 915}$-this is called the factor of striving for purity of virtuous behavior.

(2) "And what, Byagghapajjas, is the factor of striving for purity of mind? Here, secluded from sensual pleasures... a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna. This is called purity of mind. The desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension [applied with the intention]: 'In just such a way I will fulfill purity of mind that I have not yet fulfilled or assist with wisdom in various respects purity of mind that I have fulfilled' - this is called the factor of striving for purity of mind.

(3) "And what, Byagghapajjas, is the factor of striving for purity of view? Here, a bhikkhu understands as it really is: 'This is suffering'... 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' This is called purity of view. ${ }^{916}$ The desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension [applied with the intention]: 'In just such a way I will fulfill purity of view that I have not yet fulfilled or assist with wisdom in various respects purity of view that I have fulfilled'this is called the factor of striving for purity of view.

(4) "And what, Byagghapajjas, is the factor of striving for purity of liberation? That same noble disciple, possessing this factor of striving for purity of virtuous behavior, [196] this factor of striving for purity of mind, and this factor of striving for purity of view, detaches his mind from the things that cause attachment and emancipates his mind through the things that bring emancipation. He thereby reaches right liberation. This is called purity of liberation. ${ }^{917}$ The desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension [applied with the intention]: 'In just such a way I will fulfill purity of liberation that I have not yet fulfilled or assist with wisdom in various respects purity of liberation that I have fulfilled'-this is called the factor of striving for purity of liberation.

"These, Byagghapajjas, are the four factors of striving for
purity that the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, knowing and seeing, has rightly expounded for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and dejection, for the achievement of the method, for the realization of nibbāna."

# 195 (5) Vappa

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Park. Then Vappa the Sakyan, a disciple of the Niganthas, approached the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna then said to him:

"Here, Vappa, if one is restrained by body, speech, and mind, then, with the fading away of ignorance and the arising of true knowledge, do you see anything on account of which taints productive of painful feeling might flow in upon such a person in future lives?"

"I do see such a possibility, Bhante. In the past one did an evil deed whose result has not yet ripened. On that account taints productive of painful feeling might flow in upon a person in some future life. ${ }^{\prime 918}$

While this conversation between the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna and Vappa the Sakyan was underway, in the evening the Blessed One emerged from seclusion [197] and went to the attendance hall. He sat down on the appointed seat and said to the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna: "What, Moggallāna, was the discussion that you were engaged in just now? And what was the conversation of yours that was underway?"

[The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna here relates his entire conversation with Vappa the Sakyan, concluding:]

"This, Bhante, was the conversation I was having with Vappa the Sakyan when the Blessed One arrived."

Then the Blessed Oné said to Vappa the Sakyan: "If, Vappa, you would admit what should be admitted and reject what should be rejected; and if, when you do not understand the meaning of my words, you would question me about them further, saying: 'How is this, Bhante? What is the meaning of this?'; then we might discuss this."

"Bhante, I will admit to the Blessed One what should be admitted and reject what should be rejected; and when I do
not understand the meaning of his words, I will question him about them further, saying: 'How is this, Bhante? What is the meaning of this?' So let's discuss this."

(1) "What do you think, Vappa? Those taints, distressing and feverish, that might arise because of bodily undertakings do not occur when one refrains from them. I le does not create any new kamma and he terminates the old kamma having contacted it again and again. ${ }^{919}$ [198]. The wearing away is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise. Do you see, Vappa, anything on account of which taints productive of painful feeling might flow in upon such a person in future lives?"

"No, Bhante."

(2) "What do you think, Vappa? Those taints, distressing and feverish, that might arise because of verbal undertakings do not occur when one refrains from them. He does not create any new kamma and he terminates the old kamma having contacted it again and again. The wearing away is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise. Do you see, Vappa, anything on account of which taints productive of painful feeling might flow in upon such a person in future lives?"

"No, Bhante."

(3) "What do you think, Vappa? Those taints, distressing and feverish, that might arise because of mental undertakings do not occur when one refrains from them. He does not create any new kamma and he terminates the old kamma having contacted it again and again. The wearing away is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise. Do you see, Vappa, anything on account of which taints productive of painful feeling might flow in upon such a person in future lives?"

"No, Bhante."

(4) "What do you think, Vappa? With the fading away of ignorance and the arising of true knowledge, those taints, distressing and feverish, that arise with ignorance as condition no longer occur. He does not create any new kamma and he terminates the old kamma having contacted it again and again. The wearing away is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the
wise. Do you see, Vappa, anything on account of which taints productive of painful feeling might flow in upon such a person in future lives?"

"No, Bhante."

"A bhikkhu thus perfectly liberated in mind, Vappa, achieves six constant dwellings. Having seen a form with the eye, he is neither joyful nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful and clearly comprehending. ${ }^{920}$ Having heard a sound with the ear... Having smelled an odor with the nose... Having experienced a taste with the tongue... Having felt a tactile object with the body... Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, he is neither joyful nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful and clearly comprehending.

"When he feels a feeling terminating with the body, he understands: 'I feel a feeling terminating with the body.' When he feels a feeling terminating with life, he understands: 'I feel a feeling terminating with life.' He understands: 'With the breakup of the body, following the exhaustion of life, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right here. ${ }^{\prime 921}$

"Suppose, Vappa, a shadow is seen on account of a stump. Then [199] a man would come along bringing a shovel and a basket. He would cut down the stump at its foot, dig it up, and pull out the roots, even the fine rootlets and root-fibers. He would cut the stump into pieces, split the pieces, and reduce them to slivers. Then he would dry the slivers in the wind and sun, burn them in a fire, and reduce them to ashes. Having done so, he would winnow the ashes in a strong wind or let them be carried away by the swift current of a river. Thus the shadow that depended on that stump would be cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising. ${ }^{922}$

"So too, Vappa, a bhikkhu thus perfectly liberated in mind achieves six constant dwellings. Having seen a form with the eye... Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, he is neither joyful nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful and clearly comprehending. When he feels a feeling terminating with the body, he understands ...'With the breakup of the body, following the exhaustion of life, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right here.'"

When this was said, Vappa the Sakyan, a disciple of the

Niganthas, said to the Blessed One: "Suppose, Bhante, there was a man in quest of profit who raised horses for sale, but he would not gain a profit and instead would only reap weariness and distress. Just so, in quest of profit, I attended upon the foolish Niganthas, but I did not gain a profit and instead only reaped weariness and distress. Starting today, whatever confidence I had in the foolish Niganthas, I winnow in a strong wind or let it be carried away by the current of a river.

"Excellent, Bhante! ...[200]... Let the Blessed One consider me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

# 196 (6) Sālha

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesā̄ī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then Sālha the Licchavi and Abhaya the Licchavi approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Sālha the Licchavi then said to the Blessed One:

"Bhante, there are some ascetics and brahmins who proclaim the crossing of the flood through two things: by means of purification of virtuous behavior and by means of austerity and disgust. ${ }^{923}$ What does the Blessed One say about this?"

"I say, Sālha, that purification of virtuous behavior is one of the factors of asceticism. But those ascetics and brahmins who advocate austerity and disgust, who regard austerity and disgust as the essence, and who adhere to austerity and disgust are incapable of crossing the flood. ${ }^{924}$ Also, those ascetics and brahmins whose bodily, verbal, and mental behavior are impure, and whose livelihood is impure, are incapable of knowledge and vision, of unsurpassed enlightenment.

"Suppose, Sālha, a man desiring to cross a river were to take a sharp axe and enter a grove. There he would see a large sal sapling, straight, fresh, without a fruit-bud core. He would cut it down at its root, cut off the top, completely strip off the branches and foliage, trim it with axes, trim it further with hatchets, scrape it with a scraping tool, polish it with a stone ball, and set out to cross the river. What do you think, Sālha? Could that man cross the river?"

"No, Bhante. For what reason? Because although that sal sapling has been thoroughly prepared externally, [201] it has not
been purified within. It can be expected that the sal sapling will sink and the man will meet with calamity and disaster."

"So too, Sālha, those ascetics and brahmins who advocate austerity and disgust, who regard austerity and disgust as the essence, and who adhere to austerity and disgust are incapable of crossing the flood. Also, those ascetics and brahmins whose bodily, verbal, and mental behavior are impure, and whose livelihood is impure, are incapable of knowledge and vision, of unsurpassed enlightenment.

"But, Sālha, those ascetics and brahmins who do not advocate austerity and disgust, who do not regard austerity and disgust as the essence, and who do not adhere to austerity and disgust are capable of crossing the flood. Also, those ascetics and brahmins whose bodily, verbal, and mental behavior are pure, and whose livelihood is pure, are capable of knowledge and vision, of unsurpassed enlightenment.

"Suppose, Sālha, a man desiring to cross a river were to take a sharp axe and enter a grove. There he would see a large sal sapling, straight, fresh, without a fruit-bud core. He would cut it down at its root, cut off the top, completely strip off the branches and foliage, trim it with axes, trim it further with hatchets, take a chisel and thoroughly cleanse it within, scrape it with a scraping tool, polish it with a stone ball, and make it into a boat. Then he would equip it with oars and a rudder and set out to cross the river. What do you think, Sālha? Could that man cross the river?"

"Yes, Bhanté. For what reason? Because that sal sapling has been thoroughly prepared externally, well purified within, made into a boat, and equipped with oars and a rudder. It can be expected that the sal sapling will not sink and the man will safely reach the other shore."

(1) "So too, Sālha, those ascetics and brahmins who do not advocate austerity and disgust, who do not regard austerity and disgust as the essence, and who do not adhere to austerity and disgust are capable of crossing the flood. Also, those ascetics and brahmins [202] whose bodily, verbal, and mental behavior are pure, and whose livelihood is pure, are capable of knowledge and vision, of unsurpassed enlightenment.

that he is worthy of a king, an accessory of a king, and reckoned a factor of kingship. What three? He is a long-distance shooter, a sharp-shooter, and one who splits a great body.

(2) "Just as the warrior is a long-distance shooter, so too the noble disciple has right concentration. Whatever kind of form there is-whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near--a noble disciple with right concentration sees all form as it really is with correct wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' Whatever kind of feeling there is ... Whatever kind of perception there is... Whatever kind of volitional activities there are ... Whatever kind of consciousness there is-whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near-a noble disciple with right concentration sees all consciousness as it really is with correct wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.'

(3) "Just as the warrior is a sharp-shooter, so too the noble disciple has right view. The noble disciple with right view understands as it really is: 'This is suffering.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the origin of suffering.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the cessation of suffering.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.'

(4) "Just as the warrior splits a great body, so too the noble disciple has right liberation. The noble disciple with right liberation has split the great mass of ignorance." ${ }^{\prime 925}$

# 197 (7) Mallikā

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇ̣ika's Park. Then Queen Mallikā approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: ${ }^{926}$ [203]

(1) "Bhante, why is it that some women here are (i) ugly, ill formed, and unsightly; (ii) poor, destitute, and indigent; and (iii) lacking in influence? (2) And why is it that some are (i) ugly, ill formed, and unsightly; but (ii) rich, with great wealth and property; and (iii) influential? (3) And why is it that some women here are (i) beautiful, attractive, and graceful, possessing supreme beauty of complexion; but (ii) poor, destitute, and indigent; and (iii) lacking in influence? (4) And why is it that some are (i) beautiful, attractive, and graceful, possessing
supreme beauty of complexion; (ii) rich, with great wealth and property; and (iii) influential?"

(1) "Here, Mallikā, (i) some woman is prone to anger and easily exasperated. Even if she is criticized slightly she loses her temper and becomes irritated, hostile, and stubborn; she displays anger, hatred, and bitterness. (ii) She does not give things to ascetics or brahmins: food and drink; clothing and vehicles; garlands, scents, and unguents; bedding, dwellings, and lighting. (iii) And she is envious, one who envies, resents, and begrudges the gain, honor, respect, esteem, homage, and worship given to others. When she passes away from that state, if she comes back to this world, wherever she is reborn (i) she is ugly, ill formed, and unsightly; (ii) poor, destitute, and indigent; and (iii) lacking in influence.

(2) "Another woman is (i) prone to anger and easily exasperated. . . (ii) But she gives things to ascetics or brahmins. . . (iii) And she is without envy, one who does not envy, resent, or begrudge the gain, honor, respect, esteem, homage, and worship given to others. When she passes away from that state, if she comes back to this world, wherever [204] she is reborn (i) she is ugly, ill formed, and unsightly; (ii) but she is rich, with great wealth and property; and (iii) influential.

(3) "Still another woman is (i) not prone to anger or often exasperated. Even if she is criticized a lot she does not lose her temper and become irritated, hostile, and stubborn; she does not display anger, hatred, and bitterness. (ii) But she does not give things to ascetics or brahmins. . . (iii) And she is envious, one who envies, resents, and begrudges the gain, honor, respect, esteem, homage, and worship given to others. When she passes away from that state, if she comes back to this world, wherever she is reborn (i) she is beautiful, attractive, and graceful, possessing supreme beauty of complexion; (ii) but she is poor, destitute, with little wealth; (iii) and lacking in influence.

(4) "And still another woman is (i) not prone to anger or often exasperated.... (ii) And she gives things to ascetics or brahmins.... (iii) And she is without envy, one who does not envy, resent, or begrudge the gain, honor, respect, esteem, homage, and worship given to others. When she passes away from that state, if she comes back to this world, wherever she is reborn (i) she is beautiful, attractive, and graceful, possessing supreme
beauty of complexion; (ii) rich, with great wealth and property; and (iii) influential.

"This, Mallikā, is why some women here are (i) ugly, ill formed, and unsightly; (ii) poor, destitute, and indigent; and (iii) lacking in influence. This is why some are (i) ugly, ill formed, and unsightly; but (ii) rich, with great wealth and property; and (iii) influential. This is why some women here are (i) beautiful, attractive, and graceful, possessing supreme beauty of complexion; but (ii) poor, destitute, and indigent; and (iii) lacking in influence. This is why some are (i) beautiful, attractive, and graceful, possessing supreme beauty of complexion; (ii) rich, with great wealth and property; and (iii) influential."

When this was said, Queen Mallikā said to the Blessed One: "I suppose, Bhante, (i) that in some earlier life I was prone to anger and often exasperated; that even when I was criticized slightly I lost my temper and became irritated, [205] hostile, and stubborn, and displayed anger, hatred, and bitterness. Therefore I am now ugly, ill formed, and unsightly. (ii) But I suppose that in some earlier life I gave things to ascetics or brahmins . . . bedding, dwellings, and lighting. Therefore I am now rich, with great wealth and property. (iii) And I suppose that in some earlier life I was without envy, not one who envied, resented, and begrudged the gain, honor, respect, esteem, homage, and worship given to others. Therefore I am now influential. In this court there are girls of khattiya, brahmin, and householder families over whom I exercise command.

"From today, Bhante, (i) I will not be prone to anger and often exasperated. Even when I am criticized a lot I will not lose my temper and become irritated, hostile, and stubborn; I will not display anger, hatred, and bitterness. (ii) And I will give things to ascetics or brahmins: food and drink; clothing and vehicles; garlands, scents, and unguents; bedding, dwellings, and lighting. (iii) And I will not be envious, one who envies, resents, and begrudges the gain, honor, respect, esteem, homage, and worship given to others.

"Excellent, Bhante! . . [as at 4:111] . . . Let the Blessed One consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

198 (8) Self-Torment ${ }^{927}$

"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? (1) Here, a certain kind of person torments himself and pursues the practice of torturing himself. (2) But another kind of person torments others and pursues the practice of torturing others. (3) Still another kind of person torments himself and pursues the practice of torturing himself, and also torments others and pursues the practice of torturing others. (4) And still another kind of person does not torment himself or pursue the practice of torturing himself, [206] and does not torment others or pursue the practice of torturing others. Since he torments neither himself nor others, in this very life he dwells hungerless, quenched and cooled, experiencing bliss, having himself become divine. ${ }^{928}$

(1) "And how, bhikkhus, is a person one who torments himself and pursues the practice of torturing himself? ${ }^{929}$ Here, a certain person goes naked, rejecting conventions, licking his hands, not coming when asked, not stopping when asked; he does not accept food brought or food specially made or an invitation to a meal; he receives nothing from a pot, from a bowl, across a threshold, across a stick, across a pestle, from two eating together, from a pregnant woman, from a woman nursing a child, from a woman being kept by a man, from where food is advertised to be distributed, from where a dog is waiting, from where flies are buzzing; he accepts no fish or meat, he drinks no liquor, wine, or fermented brew. He keeps to one house [on alms round], to one morsel of food; he keeps to two houses, to two morsels... he keeps to seven houses, to seven morsels. He lives on one saucer a day, on two saucers a day ... on seven saucers a day. He takes food once a day, once every two days . . . once every seven days; thus even up to once every fortnight, he dwells pursuing the practice of taking food at stated intervals.

"He is an eater of greens or millet or forest rice or hide-parings or moss or rice bran or rice scum or sesame flour or grass or cow dung. He subsists on forest roots and fruits; he feeds on fallen fruits.

"He wears hemp robes, robes of hemp-mixed cloth, robes made from shrouds, rag-robes, tree bark, antelope hides, strips of antelope hide, robes of kusa grass, bark fabric, or wood-
shavings fabric; a mantle made of head hair or of animal wool, a covering made of owls' wings.

"He is one who pulls out hair and beard, pursuing the practice of pulling out hair and beard. He is one who stands continuously, rejecting seats. He is one who squats continuously, devoted to maintaining the squatting position. He is one who uses a mattress of thorns; he makes a mattress of thorns his bed. He dwells pursuing the practice of bathing in water three times daily including the evening. [207] Thus in such a variety of ways he dwells pursuing the practice of tormenting and mortifying the body. It is in this way that a person torments himself and pursues the practice of torturing himself.

(2) "And how is a person one who torments others and pursues the practice of torturing others? Here, a certain person is a butcher of sheep, a butcher of pigs, a fowler, a trapper of wild beasts, a hunter, a fisherman, a thief, an executioner, ${ }^{930}$ a prison warden, or one who follows any other such bloody occupation. It is in this way that a person is one who torments others and pursues the practice of torturing others.

(3) "And how is a person one who torments himself and pursues the practice of torturing himself and also torments others and pursues the practice of torturing others? Here, some person is a head-anointed khattiya king or an affluent brahmin. Having had a new sacrificial temple built to the east of the city, and having shaved off his hair and beard, dressed himself in rough antelope hide, and greased his body with ghee and oil, scratching his back with a deer's horn, he enters the sacrificial temple together with his chief queen and his brahmin high priest. There he lies down on the bare ground strewn with grass. The king lives on the milk in the first teat of a cow with a calf of the same color while the chief queen lives on the milk in the second teat and the brahmin high priest lives on the milk in the third teat; the milk in the fourth teat they pour onto the fire, and the calf lives on what is left. He says: 'Let so many bulls be slaughtered for sacrifice, let so many bullocks be slaughtered for sacrifice, let so many heifers be slaughtered for sacrifice, let so many goats be slaughtered for sacrifice, let so many sheep be slaughtered for sacrifice, let so many trees be felled for the sacrificial posts, let so much grass be cut for the sacrificial grass.' [208] And then his slaves, messengers, and servants make preparations,
weeping with tearful faces, being spurred on by threats of punishment and by fear. It is in this way that a person is one who torments himself and pursues the practice of torturing himself and who also torments others and pursues the practice of torturing others.

(4) "And how is a person one who does not torment himself or pursue the practice of torturing himself and does not torment others or pursue the practice of torturing others-the one who, since he torments neither himself nor others, in this very life dwells hungerless, quenched and cooled, experiencing bliss, having himself become divine?

"Here, bhikkhus, the Tathāgata arises in the world, an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One. Having realized with his own direct knowledge this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, with its devas and humans, he makes it known to others. He teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; he reveals the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life.

"A householder or householder's son or one born in some other clan hears this Dhamma. He then acquires faith in the Tathāgata and considers thus: 'Household life is crowded and dusty; life gone forth is wide open. It is not easy, while living at home, to lead the spiritual life that is utterly perfect and pure as a polished conch shell. Suppose I shave off my hair and beard, put on ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness.' On a later occasion, having abandoned a small or a large fortune, having abandoned a small or a large circle of relatives, he shaves off his hair, and beard, puts on ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness.

"Having thus gone forth and possessing the bhikkhus' training and way of life, having abandoned the destruction of life, he abstains from the destruction of life; with the rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious and kindly, he dwells compassionate toward all living beings. Having abandoned the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what is not given; [209] he takes only what is given, expects only what is given, and
dwells honestly without thoughts of theft. Having abandoned sexual activity, he observes celibacy, living apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the common person's practice.

"Having abandoned false speech, he abstains from false speech; he speaks truth, adheres to truth; he is trustworthy and reliable, no deceiver of the world. Having abandoned divisive speech, he abstains from divisive speech; he does not repeat elsewhere what he has heard here in order to divide [those people] from these, nor does he repeat to these what he has heard elsewhere in order to divide [these people] from those; thus he is one who reunites those who are divided, a promoter of unity, who enjoys concord, rejoices in concord; delights in concord, a speaker of words that promote concord. Having abandoned harsh speech, he abstains from harsh speech; he speaks words that are gentle, pleasing to the ear, lovable, words that go to the heart, courteous words that are desired by many people and agreeable to many people. Having abandoned idle chatter, he abstains from idle chatter; he speaks at a proper time, speaks what is truthful, speaks what is beneficial, speaks on the Dhamma and the discipline; at the proper time he speaks such words as are worth recording, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.

"He abstains from injuring seeds and plants. He eats once a day, ${ }^{931}$ abstaining from eating at night and outside the proper time. He abstains from dancing, singing, instrumental music, and unsuitable shows. He abstains from adorning and beautifying himself by wearing garlands and applying scents and unguents. He abstains from high and large beds. He abstains from accepting gold and silver, raw grain, raw meat, women and girls, men and women slaves, goats and sheep, fowl and pigs, elephants, cattle, horses, and mares, fields and land. He abstains from going on errands and running messages; from buying and selling; from cheating with weights, metals, and measures; from accepting bribes, deceiving, defrauding, and trickery. He abstains from wounding, murdering, binding, brigandage, plunder, and violence.

"He is content with robes to protect his body and almsfood to maintain his stomach, and wherever he goes he sets out taking only these with him. Just as a bird, wherever it goes, [210] flies with its wings as its only burden, so too, a bhikkhu is content with robes to protect his body and almsfood to maintain his
stomach, and wherever he goes he sets out taking only these with him. Possessing this aggregate of noble virtuous behavior, he experiences blameless bliss within himself.

"Having seen a form with the eye, he does not grasp at its marks and features. Since, if he left the eye faculty unrestrained, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him, he practices restraint over it; he guards the eye faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. Having heard a sound with the ear... Having smelled an odor with the nose... Having tasted a taste with the tongue... Having felt a tactile object with the body... Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, he does not grasp at its marks and features. Since, if he left the mind faculty unrestrained, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him, he practices restraint over it; he guards the mind faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty. Possessing this noble restraint of the faculties, he experiences unsullied bliss within himself.

"He acts with clear comprehension when going forward and returning; he acts with clear comprehension when looking ahead and looking away; he acts with clear comprehension when bending and stretching his limbs; he acts with clear comprehension when wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl; he acts with clear comprehension when eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting; he acts with clear comprehension when defecating and urinating; he acts with clear comprehension when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and keeping silent.

"Possessing this aggregate of noble virtuous behavior, and this noble restraint of the faculties, and this noble mindfulness and clear comprehension, he resorts to a secluded lodging: the forest, the root of a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a jungle thicket, an open space, a heap of straw.

"After his meal, on returning from his alms round, he sits down, folding his legs crosswise, straightening his body, and establishing mindfulness in front of him. Having abandoned longing for the world, he dwells with a mind free from longing; he purifies his mind from longing. Having abandoned ill will and hatred, he dwells with a mind free from ill will, compassionate toward all living beings; he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred. Having abandoned dullness and drowsiness,
[211] he dwells free from dullness and drowsiness, percipient of light, mindful and clearly comprehending; he purifies his mind from dullness and drowsiness. Having abandoned restlessness and remorse, he dwells without agitation, with a mind inwardly peaceful; he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorse. Having abandoned doubt, he dwells having gone beyond doubt, unperplexed about wholesome qualities; he purifies his mind from doubt.

"Having thus abandoned these five hindrances, defilements of the mind, qualities that weaken wisdom, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. With the subsiding of thought and examination, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration, without thought and examination. With the fading away as well of rapture, he dwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, he experiences pleasure with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: 'He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.' With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity.

"When his mind has been concentrated in this way, purified, cleansed, unblemished, rid of defilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs it to the knowledge of the recollection of past abodes... [as in 3:58 §1]... to the knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings... [as in 3:58 §2]... to the knowledge of the destruction of the taints. He understands as it really is: 'This is suffering'; he understands as it really is: 'This is the origin of suffering'; he understands as it really is: 'This is the cessation of suffering'; he understands as it really is: 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' He understands as it really is: 'These are the taints'; he understands as it really is: 'This is the origin of the taints'; he understands as it really is: 'This is the cessation of the taints'; he understands as it really is: 'This is the way leading to the cessation of the taints.'

"When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from
the taint of sensuality, from the taint of existence, and from the taint of ignorance. When it is liberatéd there comes the knowledge: '[It's] liberated.' He understands: 'Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.'

"It is in this way that a person is one who does not torment himself or pursue the practice of torturing himself and who does not torment others or pursue the practice of torturing othersone who, since he torments neither himself nor others, in this very life dwells hungerless, quenched and cooled, experiencing bliss, having himself become divine.

"These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of persons found existing in the wórid."

# 199 (9) Craving

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you about craving-the ensnarer, streaming, widespread, and sticky ${ }^{932}$-by which this world has been smothered and enveloped, and by which it has become a tangled skein, a knotted ball of thread, a mass of reeds and rushes, [212] so that it does not pass beyond the plane of misery, the bad destination, the lower world, samsāra. Listen and attend closely; I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"And what, bhikkhus, is craving-the ensnarer, streaming, widespread, and sticky-by which this world has been smothered and enveloped, and by which it has become a tangled skein, a knotted ball of thread, a mass of reeds and rushes, so that it does not pass beyond the plane of misery, the bad destination, the lower world, samsāra?

"There are, bhikkhus, these eighteen currents of craving related to the internal and eighteen currents of craving related to the external.

"And what are the eighteen currents of craving related to the internal? When there is [the notion] 'I am,' there are [the notions] 'I am thus,' 'I am just so,' 'I am otherwise,' 'I am lasting,' 'I am evanescent,' 'I may be,' 'I may be thus,' 'I may be just so,' 'I may be otherwise,' 'May I be,' 'May I be thus,' 'May I be just so,' 'May I be otherwise,' 'I shall be,' 'I shall be thus,' 'I shall be just so,' 'I shall be otherwise.' These are the eighteen currents of craving related to the internal. ${ }^{933}$
"And what are the eighteen currents of craving related to the external? ${ }^{934}$ When there is [the notion], 'I am because of this,' ${ }^{935}$ there are [the notions]: 'I am thus because of this,' 'I am just so because of this,' 'I am otherwise because of this,' 'I am lasting because of this,' 'I am evanescent because of this,' 'I may be because of this,' 'I may be thus because of this,' 'I may be just so because of this,' 'I may be otherwise because of this,' 'May I be because of this,' 'May I be thus because of this,' 'May I be just so because of this,' 'May I be otherwise because of this,' 'I shall be because of this,' 'I shall be thus because of this,' 'I shall be just so because of this,' 'I shall be otherwise because of this.' These are the eighteen currents of craving related to the external.

"Thus there are eighteen currents of craving related to the internal, and eighteen currents of craving related to the external. These are called the thirty-six currents of craving. There are thirty-six such currents of craving pertaining to the past, thirty-six pertaining to the future, [213] and thirty-six pertaining to the present. So there are one hundred and eight currents of craving.

"This, bhikkhus, is that craving-the ensnarer, streaming, widespread, and sticky-by which this world has been smothered and enveloped, and by which it has become a tangled skein, a knotted ball of thread, a mass of reeds and rushes, so that it does not pass beyond the plane of misery, the bad destination, the lower world, samsāra." ${ }^{\prime 936}$

# 200 (10) Affection

"Bhikkhus, there are these four things that are born. What four? Affection is born from affection; hatred is born from affection; affection is born from hatred; and hatred is born from hatred.

(1) "And how, bhikkhus, is affection born from affection? Here, one person is desirable, lovable, and agreeable to another. Others treat that person in a way that is desirable, lovable, and agreeable. It occurs to the latter: 'Others treat that person who is desirable, lovable, and agreeable to me in a way that is desirable, lovable, and agreeable.' He thus feels affection for them. It is in this way that affection is born from affection.

(2) "And how is hatred born from affection? Here, one person is desirable, lovable, and agreeable to another. Others treat that person in a way that is undesirable, unlovable, and disagreeable.

It occurs to the latter: 'Others treat that person who is desirable, lovable, and agreeable to me in a way that is undesirable, unlovable, and disagreeable.' He thus feels hatred for them. It is in this way that hatred is born from affection.

(3) "And how is affection born from hatred? Here, one person is undesirable, unlovable, and disagreeable to another. Others treat that person in a way that is undesirable, unlovable, and disagreeable. It occurs to the latter: 'Others treat that person who is undesirable, unlovable, and disagreeable to me in a way that is undesirable, unlovable, and disagreeable.' He thus feels affection for them. It is in this way that affection is born from hatred.

(4) "And how is hatred born from hatred? Here, one person is undesirable, unlovable, [214] and disagreeable to another. Others treat that person in a way that is desirable, lovable, and agreeable. It occurs to the latter: 'Others treat that person who is undesirable, unlovable, and disagreeable to me in a way that is desirable, lovable, and agreeable.' He thus feels hatred for them. It is in this way that hatred is born from hatred.

"These are the four things that are born.

"When, secluded from sensual pleasures . . . a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna, on that occasion affection born from affection does not exist in him, hatred born from affection does not exist in him, affection born from hatred does not exist in him, and hatred born from hatred does not exist in him.

"When, with the subsiding of thought and examination, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna... the third jhāna . . . the fourth jhāna, on that occasion affection born from affection does not exist in him, hatred born from affection does not exist in him, affection born from hatred does not exist in him, and hatred born from hatred does not exist in him.

"When, with the destruction of the taints, a bhikkhu has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it, then he has abandoned affection born from affection, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising; he has abandoned hatred born from affection, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising; he has abandoned affection born
from hatred, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising; and he has abandoned hatred born from hatred, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising.

"This is called a bhikkhu who neither picks up nor pushes away, who does not fume, does not blaze, and does not ruminate.

"And how does a bhikkhu pick up ${ }^{937}$ Here, a bhikkhu regards form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form. He regards feeling as self...[215]... perception as self . . . volitional activities as self . . . consciousness as self, or self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness. It is in this way that a bhikkhu picks up.

"And how does a bhikkhu not pick up? Here, a bhikkhu does not regard form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form. He does not regard feeling as self . . perception as self . . volitional activities as self . . consciousness as self, or self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness. It is in this way that a bhikkhu does not pick up.

"And how does a bhikkhu push away? Here, a bhikkhu insults one who insults him, scolds one who scolds him, and argues with one who picks an argument with him. It is in this way that a bhikkhu pushes away.

"And how does a bhikkhu not push away? Here, a bhikkhu does not insult one who insults him, does not scold one who scolds him, and does not argue with one who picks an argument with him. It is in this way that a bhikkhu does not push away.

"And how does a bhikkhu fume? When there is [the notion] 'I am,' there are [the notions] 'I am thus,' 'I am just so,' 'I am otherwise,' 'I am lasting,' 'I am evanescent,' 'I may be,' 'I may be thus,' 'I may be just so,' 'I may be otherwise,' 'May I be,' 'May I be thus,' 'May I be just so,' 'May I be otherwise,' 'I shall be,' 'I shall be thus,' 'I shall be just so,' 'I shall be otherwise.' It is in this way that a bhikkhu fumes.

"And how does a bhikkhu not fume? When there is no [notion] 'I am,' there are no [notions] 'I am thus'...[216]...'I shall be otherwise.' It is in this way that a bhikkhu does not fume.

"And how does a bhikkhu blaze? When there is [the notion],
'I am because of this,' there are [the notions]: 'I am thus because of this,' 'I am just so because of this,' 'I am otherwise because of this,' 'I am lasting because of this,' 'I am evanescent because of this,' 'I may be because of this,' 'I may be thus because of this,' 'I may be just so because of this,' 'I may be otherwise because of this,' 'May I be because of this,' 'May I be thus because of this,' 'May I be just so because of this,' 'May I be otherwise because of this,' 'I shall be because of this,' 'I shall be thus because of this,' 'I shall be just so because of this,' 'I shall be otherwise because of this.' It is in this way that a bhikkhu blazes.

"And how does a bhikkhu not blaze? When there is no [notion], 'I am because of this,' there are no [notions]: 'I am thus because of this'... 'I shall be otherwise because of this.' It is in this way that a bhikkhu does not blaze.

"And how does a bhikkhu ruminate? ${ }^{938}$ Here, a bhikkhu has not abandoned the conceit 'I am,' cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising. It is in this way that a bhikkhu ruminates.

"And how does a bhikkhu not ruminate? Here, a bhikkhu has abandoned the conceit 'I am,' cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising. It is in this way that a bhikkhu does not ruminate." [217]

# The Fifth Fifty

## 201 (1) Training Rules

"Bhikkhus, 'only here is there an ascetic, a second ascetic, a third ascetic, and a fourth ascetic. The other sects are empty of ascetics.' It is in such a way that you should rightly roar your lion's roar." [239]

242 (11) Benefits of a Good Person

"Bhikkhus, by relying on a good person, four benefits are to be expected. What four? One grows in noble virtuous behavior; one grows in noble concentration; one grows in noble wisdom; and one grows in noble liberation. By relying on a good person, these four benefits are to be expected."

# V. Perils of Offenses

243 (1) Schism

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita's Park. Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Has that disciplinary issue been settled yet, Ānanda?"948

"How could that disciplinary issue be settled, Bhante? The Venerable Anuruddha's pupil Bāhiya is still fully intent on creating a schism in the Sangha, but the Venerable Anuruddha doesn't think of saying even a single word about it."

"But, Ānanda, when has Anuruddha ever concemed himself with disciplinary issues in the midst of the Sangha? Shouldn't you, and Sāriputta and Moggallāna, settle any disciplinary issues that arise?

"Seeing these four advantages, Ānanda, an evil bhikkhu delights in a schism in the Sangha. What four?

(1) "Here, an evil bhikkhu is immoral, of bad character, impure, of suspect behavior, secretive in his actions, not an ascetic though claiming to be one, not a celibate though claiming to be one, [240] inwardly rotten, corrupt, depraved. It occurs to him: 'If the bhikkhus find out that I am immoral . . . depraved, and they are united, they will expel me, but if they are divided into factions they won't expel me.' Seeing this first advantage, an evil bhikkhu delights in a schism in the Sangha.

(2) "Again, an evil bhikkhu holds wrong view; he resorts to an extremist view. It occurs to him: 'If the bhikkhus find out that I hold wrong view, that I resort to an extremist view, and they are united, they will expel me, but if they are divided into factions they won't expel me.' Seeing this second advantage, an evil bhikkhu delights in a schism in the Sangha.

(3) "Again, an evil bhikkhu is of wrong livelihood; he earns
his living by wrong livelihood. It occurs to him: 'If the bhikkhus find out that I am of wrong livelihood and earn my living by wrong livelihood, and they are united; they will expel me, but if they are divided into factions they won't expel me.' Seeing this third advantage, an evil bhikkhu delights in a schism in the Sangha.

(4) "Again, an evil bhikkhu is desirous of gain, honor, and admiration. It occurs to him: 'If the bhikkhus find out that I am desirous of gain, honor, and admiration, and they are united, they will not honor, respect, esteem, and venerate me; but if they are divided into factions they will honor, respect, esteem, and venerate me.' Seeing this fourth advantage, an evil bhikkhu delights in a schism in the Sangha.

"Seeing these four adivantages, Ānanda, an evil bhikkhu delights in a schism in the Sangha."

# 244 (2) Offenses

"Bhikkhus, there are these four perils of offenses. What four?

(1) "Suppose, bhikkhus, they were to arrest a thief, a criminal, and show him to the king, saying: 'Your majesty, this is a thief, a criminal. Let your majesty impose a penalty on him.' The king would say to them: [241] 'Go, sirs, and tie this man's arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope, shave his head, and lead him around from street to street, from square to square, to the ominous beating of a drum. Then take him out through the south gate and behead him south of the city.' The king's men would do as instructed and behead that man south of the city. A man standing on the sidelines might think: 'Truly, this man must have committed an evil deed, reprehensible, punishable by beheading, insofar as the king's men tied his arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope ... and beheaded him south of the city. Indeed, I should never do such an evil deed, reprehensible, punishable by beheading.'

"So too, when a bhikkhu or bhikkhunī has set up such a keen perception of peril in regard to the parājika offenses, it can be expected that one who has never yet committed a parājika offense will not commit one; and one who has committed such an offense will make amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma. ${ }^{949}$

(2) "Suppose, bhikkhus, a man were to wrap himself in a black cloth, loosen his hair, put a club on his shoulder, and tell a
large crowd of people: 'Worthy sirs, ${ }^{950}$ I have committed an evil deed, reprehensible, punishable by clubbing. Let me do whatever will make you pleased with me.' A man standing on the sidelines might think: 'Truly, this man must have committed an evil deed, reprehensible, punishable by clubbing, insofar as he has wrapped himself in a black cloth, loosened his hair, put a club on his shoulder, and tells a large crowd of people: "Worthy sirs, I have committed an evil deed, reprehensible, deserving a clubbing. Let me do whatever will make you pleased with me." [242] Indeed, I should never do such an evil deed, reprehensible, punishable by clubbing.'

"So too, when a bhikkhu or bhikkhunī has set up such a keen perception of peril in regard to the sanghädisesa offenses, it can be expected that one who has never yet committed a sanghädisesa offense will not commit one, and one who has committed such an offense will make amends for it in accordance with' the Dhamma. ${ }^{951}$.

(3) "Suppose, bhikkhus, a man were to wrap himself in a black cloth, loosen his hair, put a sack of ashes on his shoulder, and tell a large crowd of people: 'Worthy sirs, I have committed an evil deed, reprehensible, punishable by a sack of ashes. ${ }^{952}$ Let me do whatever will make you pleased with me.' A man standing on the sidelines might think: 'Truly, this man must have committed an evil deed, reprehensible, punishable by a sack of ashes, insofar as he has wrapped himself in a black cloth, loosened his hair, put a sack of ashes on his shoulder, and tells a large crowd of people: "Worthy sirs, I have committed an evil deed, reprehensible, punishable by a sack of ashes. Let me do whatever will make you pleased with me." Indeed, I should never do such an evil deed, reprehensible, [to be punished with] a sack of ashes.'

"So too, when a bhikkhu or bhikkhunī has set up such a keen perception of peril in regard to the pācittiya offenses, it can be expected that one who has never yet committed a pācittiya offense will not commit one, and one who has committed such an offense will make amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma. ${ }^{953}$

(4) "Suppose, bhikkhus, a man were to wrap himself in a black cloth, loosen his hair, and tell a large crowd of people: 'Worthy sirs, I have committed an evil deed, reprehensible, censurable. Let me do whatever will make you pleased with me.'

A man standing on the sidelines might think: 'Truly, this man must have committed an evil deed, reprehensible, censurable, insofar as he has wrapped himself in a black cloth, loosened his hair, and tells a large crowd of people: [243] "Worthy sirs, I have committed an evil deed, reprehensible, censurable. Let me do whatever will make you pleased with me." Indeed, I should never do such an evil deed, reprehensible, censurable.'

"So too, when a bhikkhu or bhikkhunī has set up such a keen perception of peril in regard to the pätidesanīya offenses, it can be expected that one who has never yet committed a pätidesanīya offense will not commit one, and one who has committed such an offense will make amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma. ${ }^{954}$

"These, bhikkhus, are the four perils of offenses."

# 245 (3) Training

"Bhikkhus, this spiritual life is lived with the training as its benefit, with wisdom as its supervisor, with liberation as its core, and with mindfulness as its authority. ${ }^{955}$

(1) "And how, bhikkhus, is training its benefit? Here, the training pertaining to proper conduct ${ }^{956}$ has been prescribed by me to my disciples so that those without confidence gain confidence and those with confidence increase [in their confidence]. One takes up this training pertaining to proper conduct in just the way that I have prescribed it to my disciples, keeping it unbroken, flawless, unblemished, and unblotched, so that those without confidence gain confidence and those with confidence increase [in their confidence]. Having undertaken them, one trains in the training rules.

"Again, the training fundamental to the spiritual life ${ }^{957}$ has been prescribed by me to my disciples for the utterly complete destruction of suffering. One takes up this training fundamental to the spiritual life in just the way that I have prescribed it to my disciples for the utterly complete destruction of suffering, keeping it unbroken, flawless, unblemished, and unblotched. Having undertaken them, one trains in the training rules. It is in this way that the training is its benefit.

(2) "And how is wisdom its supervisor? Here, the teachings have been taught by me to my disciples for the utterly complete destruction of suffering. One scrutinizes those teachings with
wisdom in just the way that I have taught them to my disciples for the utterly complete destruction of suffering. It is in this way that wisdom is its supervisor. ${ }^{958}$ [244]

(3) "And how is liberation its core? Here, the teachings have been taught by me to my disciples for the utterly complete destruction of suffering. Through liberation one experiences those teachings in just the way that I have taught them to my disciples for the utterly complete destruction of suffering. It is in this way that liberation is its core. ${ }^{959}$

(4) "And how is mindfulness its authority? One's mindfulness is well established internally thus: 'In just such a way I will fulfill the training pertaining to good conduct that I have not yet fulfilled or assist with wisdom in various respects the training pertaining to good conduct that I have fulfilled. ${ }^{960}$ And one's mindfulness is well established internally thus: 'In just such a way I will fulfill the training pertaining to the fundamentals of the spiritual life that I have not yet fulfilled or assist with wisdom in various respects the training pertaining to the fundamentals of the spiritual life that I have fulfilled.' And one's mindfulness is well established internally thus: 'In just such a way I will scrutinize with wisdom the teachings that I have not yet scrutinized or assist with wisdom in various respects the teachings that I have scrutinized.' And one's mindfulness is well established internally thus: 'In just such a way I will experience through liberation the Dhamma that I have not yet experienced or assist with wisdom in various respects the Dhamma that I have experienced.' It is in this way that mindfulness is its authority.

"Thus when it was said: 'Bhikkhus, this spiritual life is lived with the training as its benefit, with wisdom as its supervisor, with liberation as its core, and with mindfulness as its authority,' it is because of this that this was said."

# 246 (4) Lying Down

"Bhikkhus, there are these four postures for lying down. What four? The corpse's posture, the sensualist's posture, the lion's posture, and the Tathāgata's posture.

(1) "And what is the corpse's posture? Corpses usually lie flat on their backs. This is called the corpse's posture.

(2) "And what is the sensualist's posture? The sensualist
usually lies on his left side. This is called the sensualist's posture.

(3) "And what is the lion's posture? [245] The lion, the king of beasts, lies down on his right side, having covered one foot with the other and tucked his tail in between his thighs. When he awakens, he raises his front quarters and looks back at his hind quarters. If the lion sees any disorderliness or distension of his body, he is displeased. If he does not see any disorderliness or distension of his body, he is pleased. This is called the lion's posture.

(4) "And what is the Tathāgata's posture? Here, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, the Tathāgata enters and dwells in the first jhāna... the fourth jhāna. This is called the Tathāgata's posture.

"These are the four postures."

247 (5) Worthy of a Stüpa

"Bhikkhus; these four are worthy of a stupa. What four? The Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One; a paccekabuddha; a Tathāgata's disciple; and a universal monarch. These four are worthy of a stupa." ${ }^{\prime 961}$

Saying that one has seen what one has not seen, saying that one has heard what one has not heard, saying that one has sensed what one has not sensed, saying that one has cognized what one has not cognized.

# VI. DiRECT KNOWLEDGE

254 (1) Direct Knowledge

"Bhikkhus, there are these four things. What four? (1) There are things to be fully understood by direct knowledge. (2) There are [247] things to be abandoned by direct knowledge. (3) There are things to be developed by direct knowledge. (4) There are things to be realized by direct knowledge. ${ }^{964}$

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, are the things to be fully understood by direct knowledge? The five aggregates subject to clinging. These are called the things to be fully understood by direct knowledge.

(2) "And what are the things to be abandoned by direct knowledge? Ignorance and craving for existence. These are called the things to be abandoned by direct knowledge.

(3) "And what are the things to be developed by direct knowledge? Serenity and insight. These are called the things to be developed by direct knowledge.
(4) "And what are the things to be realized by direct knowledge? True knowledge and liberation. These are called the things to be realized by direct knowledge.

"These, bhikkhus, are the four things."

# 255 (2) Quests

"Bhikkhus, there are these four ignoble quests. ${ }^{965}$ What four? (1) Here, someone who is himself subject to old age seeks only what is subject to old age; (2) who is himself subject to illness seeks only what is subject to illness; (3) who is himself subject to death seeks only what is subject to death; and (4) who is himself subject to defilement seeks only what is subject to defilement. These are the four ignoble quests.

"There are, bhikkhus, these four noble quests. What four? (1) Here, someone who is himself subject to old age, having understood the danger in what is subject to old age, seeks the unaging; unsurpassed security from bondage, nibbāna; (2) who is himself subject to illness, having understood the danger in what is subject to illness, seeks the illness-free, unsurpassed security from bondage, nibbāna; (3) who is himself subject to death, having understood the danger in what is subject to death, seeks the deathless, unsurpassed security from bondage, nibbāna; (4) who is himself subject to defilement, having understood the danger in what is subject to defilement, [248] seeks the undefiled, unsurpassed security from bondage, nibbāna. These are the four noble quests."

## 256 (3) Sustaining

"Bhikkhus, there are these four means of sustaining a favorable relationship. What four? Giving, endearing speech, beneficent conduct, and impartiality. These are the four means of sustaining a favorable relationship."966

## 257 (4) Māluñkyāputta

Then the Venerable Māluñkyāputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: ${ }^{967}$

"Bhante, it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that, having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute."
"Here now, Māluñkyāputta, what should we say to the young bhikkhus when an old man like you, decrepit and advanced in years, asks for a brief exhortation from the Tathāgata?"

"Bhante, let the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma in brief! Let the Fortunate One teach me the Dhamma in brief! Perhaps I can understand the meaning of the Blessed One's statement; perhaps I can become an heir of the Blessed One's statement."

"There are, Māluñkyāputta, these four sources of craving for a bhikkhu. What four? Craving arises in a bhikkhu because of robes, almsfood, lodgings, or for the sake of life here or elsewhere. ${ }^{968}$ These are the four sources of craving for a bhikkhu. [249] When, Māluñkyāputta, a bhikkhu has abandoned craving, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump; obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising, he is called a bhikkhu who has cut off craving, stripped off the fetter, and by completely breaking through conceit, has made an end of suffering."

Then the Venerable Māluñkyāputta, exhorted in this way by the Blessed One, rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed.

Then, dwelling alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute, in no long time the Venerable Māluñkyāputta realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having entered upon it, he dwelled in it. He directly knew: "Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being." And the Venerable Māluñkyāputta became one of the arahants.

# 258 (5) Families

"Bhikkhus, whatever families do not last long after attaining abundance of wealth, all do not last long for four reasons, or a particular one among them. What four? (1) They do not seek what has been lost; (2) they do not repair what has become decrepit; (3) they overindulge in eating and drinking; or (4) they appoint an immoral woman or man to be their chief. Whatever families do not last long after attaining abundance of wealth,
all do not last long for these four reasons, or a particular one among them. ${ }^{969}$

# 259 (6) Thoroughbred (1)

"Bhikkhus, possessing four factors a king's excellent thoroughbred horse is worthy of a king, an accessory of a king, and reckoned as a factor of kingship. ${ }^{970}$ What four? Here, a king's excellent thoroughbred horse possesses beauty, strength, speed, and the right proportions. Possessing these four factors, a king's excellent thoroughbred horse is . . . reckoned as a factor of kingship.

"So too, bhikkhus, possessing four qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings; worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What four? Here, a bhikkhu possesses beauty, strength, speed, and the right proportions.

(1) "And how does a bhikkhu possess beauty? Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. It is in this way that a bhikkhu possesses beauty.

(2) "And how does a bhikkhu possess strength? Here, a bhikkhu has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities. It is in this way that a bhikkhu possesses strength.

(3) "And how does a bhikkhu possess speed? Here, a bhikkhu understands as it really is: 'This is suffering'; he understands as it really is: 'This is the origin of suffering'; he understands as it really is: 'This is the cessation of suffering'; he understands as it really is: 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' It is in this way that a bhikkhu possesses speed.
(4) "And how does a bhikkhu possess the right proportions? Here, a bhikkhu is one who gains robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick. It is in this way that a bhikkhu possesses the right proportions. [251]

"Possessing these four qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

# 260 (7) Thoroughbred (2)

[All as in 4:259, with only the following difference: $]^{971}$

(3) "And how does a bhikkhu possess speed? Here, with the destruction of the taints, a bhikkhu has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. It is in this way that a bhikkhu possesses speed." [252]

# The Book of the Fives

## Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One

## The First Fifty

## I. The Trainee's Powers

## 1 (1) In Brief

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, there are these five trainee's powers. ${ }^{974}$ What five? The power of faith, the power of moral shame, the power of moral dread, the power of energy, and the power of wisdom. These are the five trainee's powers. Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will possess the power of faith, a trainee's power; we will possess the power of moral shame, a trainee's power; we will possess the power of moral dread, a trainee's power; we will possess the power of wisdom, a trainee's power.' Thus, bhikkhus, should you train yourselves." [This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed One's statement. $]^{975}$ [2]

## 2 (2) In Detail

At Sāvatthī. "Bhikkhus, there are these five trainee's powers. What five? The power of faith, the power of moral shame, the
power of moral dread, the power of energy, and the power of wisdom.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the power of faith? Here, a noble disciple is endowed with faith. He places faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' This is called the power of faith.

(2) "And what is the power of moral shame? Here, a noble disciple has a sense of moral shame; he is ashamed of bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct; he is ashamed of acquiring evil, unwholesome qualities. This is called the power of moral shame.

(3) "And what is the power of moral dread? Here, a noble disciple dreads wrongdoing; he dreads bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct; he dreads acquiring evil, unwholesome qualities. This is called the power of moral dread. ${ }^{976}$

(4) "And what is the power of energy? Here, a noble disciple has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities. This is called the power of energy.

(5) "And what is the power of wisdom? Here, a noble disciple is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. ${ }^{977}$ This is called the power of wisdom.

"These are the five trainee's powers. Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will possess the power of faith, a trainee's power; we will possess the power of moral shame, a trainee's power; we will possess the power of moral dread, [3] a trainee's power; we will possess the power of energy, a trainee's power; we will possess the power of wisdom, a trainee's power.' Thus, bhikkhus, should you train yourselves."

# 3 (3) Suffering

"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a bhikkhu dwells in suffering in this very life-with distress, anguish, and fever-and with the breakup of the body, after death, a bad destination can
be expected for him. What five? Here, a bhikkhu is devoid of faith, morally shameless, morally reckless, lazy, and unwise. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu dwells in suffering in this very life-with distress, anguish, and fever-and with the breakup of the body, after death, he can expect a bad destination.

"Bhikkhus, possessing five [other] qualities, a bhikkhu dwells happily in this very life-without distress, anguish, and feverand with the breakup of the body, after death, a good destination can be expected for him. What five? Here, a bhikkhu is endowed with faith, has a sense of moral shame, has moral dread, and is energetic and wise. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu dwells happily in this very life-without distress, anguish, and fever-and with the breakup of the body, after death, a good destination can be expected for him."

# 4 (4) As If Brought There

"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a bhikkhu is deposited in hell as if brought there. What five? Here, a bhikkhu is devoid of faith, morally shameless, morally reckless, lazy, and unwise. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu is deposited in hell as if brought there. [4]

"Bhikkhus, possessing five [other] qualities, a bhikkhu is deposited in heaven as if brought there. What five? Here, a bhikkhu is endowed with faith, has a sense of moral shame, has moral dread, and is energetic and wise. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu is deposited in heaven as if brought there."

## 5 (5) Training

"Bhikkhus, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who gives up the training and reverts to the lower life incurs five reasonable criticisms and grounds for censure in this very life. What five? (1) 'You did not have faith in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. (2) You did not have a sense of moral shame in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. (3) You did not have moral dread in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. (4) You did not have energy in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. (5) You did not have wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities.' Any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who gives up the training and reverts to the lower life incurs
these five reasonable criticisms and grounds for censure in this very life.

"Bhikkhus, any bhikkhu or bhikkhuni who lives the complete and pure spiritual life, even with pain and dejection, weeping with a tearful face, gains five reasonable grounds for praise in this very life. What five? (1)'You have had faith in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. (2) You have had a sense of moral shame in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. (3) You have had moral dread in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. (4) You have had energy in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. (5) You have had wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities.' Any bhikkhu or bhikkhuni who lives the complete and pure spiritual life, even with pain and dejection, weeping with a tearful face, [5] gains these five reasonable grounds for praise in this very life."

# 6 (6) Entering

(1) "Bhikkhus, there is no entering upon the unwholesome so long as faith is securely settled in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. But when faith has disappeared and lack of faith obsesses one, then there is the entering upon the unwholesome.

(2) "There is no entering upon the unwholesome so long as a sense of moral shame is securely settled in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. But when a sense of moral shame has disappeared and moral shamelessness obsesses one, then there is the entering upon the unwholesome.

(3) "There is no entering upon the unwholesome so long as moral dread is securely settled in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. But when moral dread has disappeared and lack of moral dread obsesses one, then there is the entering upon the unwholesome.

(4) "There is no entering upon the unwholesome so long as energy is securely settled in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. But when energy has disappeared and laziness obsesses one, then there is the entering upon the unwholesome.

(5) "There is no entering upon the unwholesome so long as wisdom is securely settled in [cultivating] wholesome qualities. But when wisdom has disappeared and lack of wisdom obsesses one, then there is the entering upon the unwholesome."

# 7 (7) Sensual Pleasures

"Bhikkhus, beings for the most part are captivated by sensual pleasures. When a clansman has forsaken the sickle and carrying-pole and gone forth from the household life into homelessness, he can be described as a clansman who has gone forth out of faith. For what reason? Sensual pleasures, whether of this or that kind, can be obtained by a youth. Inferior sensual pleasures, middling sensual pleasures, and superior sensual pleasures are all reckoned simply as sensual pleasures. [6]

"Suppose a young infant boy, ignorant, lying on his back, were to put a stick or pebble in his mouth because of his nurse's heedlessness. His nurse would quickly attend to him and try to take it out. If she could not quickly take it out, she would brace the boy's head with her left hand and, hooking a finger of her right hand, she would take it out even if she had to draw blood. For what reason? There would be some distress for the boy-this I don't deny-but the nurse has to do so for his good and welfare, out of compassion for him. However, when the boy has grown up and has enough sense, the nurse would be unconcerned about him, thinking: 'The boy can now look after himself. He won't be heedless.'

"So too, so long as a bhikkhu is still not accomplished in faith in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, in a sense of shame in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, in moral dread in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, in energy in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, and in wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, I must still look after him. But when that bhikkhu is accomplished in faith in [cultivating] wholesome qualities .... accomplished in wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, then I am unconcerned about him, thinking: 'The bhikkhu can now look after himself. He won't be heedless." ${ }^{\prime \prime 978}$

## 8 (8) Falling Away (1)

# II. POWERS

## 11 (1) Not Heard Before

"Bhikkhus, I claim to have attained the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge regarding things not heard before. ${ }^{979}$

"There are these five Tathāgata's powers that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he claims the place of the chief bull, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the brahma wheel. ${ }^{980}$ What five? The power of faith, the power of moral shame, the power of moral dread, the power of energy, and the power of wisdom. These are the five Tathāgata's powers that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he claims the place of
the chief bull, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the brahma wheel." [10]

# 12 (2) Peak (1)

"Bhikkhus, there are these five trainee's powers. What five? The power of faith, the power of moral shame, the power of moral dread, the power of energy, and the power of wisdom. These are the five trainee's powers. Among these five trainee's powers, the power of wisdom is foremost, the one that holds all the others in place, the one that unifies them. Just as the peak is the chief part of a peaked-roof house, the part that holds all the others in place, that unifies them, so among these five trainee powers, the power of wisdom is foremost, the one that holds all the others in place, the one that unifies them.

"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: (1) 'We will possess the power of faith, a trainee's power; (2) the power of moral shame, a trainee's power; (3) the power of moral dread, a trainee's power; (4) the power of energy, a trainee's power; (5) the power of wisdom, a trainee's power.' Thus, bhikkhus, should you train yourselves."

## 13 (3) In Brief

"Bhikkhus, there are these five powers. What five? The power of faith, the power of energy, the power of mindfulness, the power of concentration, and the power of wisdom. These are the five powers." ${ }^{\prime 981}$

## 14 (4) In Detail

"Bhikkhus; there are these five powers. What five? The power of faith, the power of energy, the power of mindfulness, the power of concentration, and the power of wisdom.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the power of faith? Here, a noble disciple is endowed with faith. He places faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened... [as in 5:2] . . . the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' [11] This is called the power of faith.

(2) "And what is the power of energy? Here, a noble disciple has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities. This is called the power of energy.
(3) "And what is the power of mindfulness? Here, the noble disciple is mindful, possessing supreme mindfulness and alertness, one who remembers and recollects what was done and said long ago. This is called the power of mindfulness.

(4) "And what is the power of concentration? Here, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. With the subsiding of thought and examination, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration, without thought and examination. With the fading away as well of rapture, he dwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, he experiences pleasure with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: 'He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.' With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity. This is called the power of concentration.

(5) "And what is the power of wisdom? Here, a noble disciple is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. This is called the power of wisdom.

"These, bhikkhus, are the five powers."

# 15 (5) To Be Seen

(1) "And where, bhikkhus, is the power of faith to be seen? The power of faith is to be seen in the four factors of streamentry. ${ }^{982}$ (2) And where is the power of energy to be seen? The power of energy is to be seen in the four right strivings. (3) And where is the power of mindfulness to be seen? The power of mindfulness is to be seen in the four establishments of mindfulness. (4) And where is the power of concentration to be seen? The power of concentration is to be seen in the four jhānas: (5)

(1) Here, a bhikkhu is himself accomplished in virtuous behavior and encourages others to become accomplished in virtuous behavior; (2) he is himself accomplished in concentration and encourages others to become accomplished in concentration; (3) he is himself accomplished in wisdom and encourages others to become accomplished in wisdom; (4) he is himself accomplished in liberation and encourages others to become accomplished in liberation; (5) he is himself accomplished in the knowledge and vision of liberation and encourages others
to become accomplished in the knowledge and vision of liberation. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu is practicing both for his own welfare and for the welfare of others."

# III. Five Factored

21 (1) Irreverent (1)

"(1) Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is irreverent and undeferential, and his behavior is uncongenial to his fellow monks, it is impossible for him to fulfill the factor of proper conduct. [15] (2) Without fulfilling the factor of proper conduct, it is impossible for him to fulfill the factor of a trainee. (3) Without fulfilling the factor of a trainee, it is impossible for him to fulfill virtuous behavior. (4) Without fulfilling virtuous behavior, it is impossible for him to fulfill right view. (5) Without fulfilling right view, it is impossible for him to fulfill right concentration. ${ }^{983}$

"(1) But, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is reverential and deferential, and his behavior is congenial to his fellow monks, it is possible for him to fulfill the duty of proper conduct. (2) Having fulfilled the duty of proper conduct, it is possible for him to fulfill the duty of a trainee. (3) Having fulfilled the duty of a trainee, it is possible for him to fulfill virtuous behavior. (4) Having fulfilled virtuous behavior, it is possible for him to fulfill right view. (5) Having fulfilled right view, it is possible for him to fulfill right concentration."

## 22 (2) Irreverent (2)

"(1) Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is irreverent and undeferential, and his behavior is uncongenial to his fellow monks, it is impossible for him to fulfill the factor of proper conduct. (2) Without fulfilling the factor of proper conduct, it is impossible for him to fulfill the factor of a trainee. (3) Without fulfilling the factor of a trainee, it is impossible for him to fulfill the aggregate of virtuous behavior. (4) Without fulfilling the aggregate of virtuous behavior, it is impossible for him to fulfill the aggregate of concentration. (5) Without fulfilling the aggregate of concentration, it is impossible for him to fulfill the aggregate of wisdom.

"(1) But, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is reverential and deferential, and his behavior is congenial to his fellow monks, it is possible for him to fulfill the factor of proper conduct. (2)

Having fulfilled the.factor of proper conduct, it is possible for him to fulfill the factor of a trainee. (3) Having fulfilled the factor of a trainee, it is possible for him to fulfill the aggregate of virtuous behavior. (4) Having fulfilled the aggregate of virtuous behavior, it is possible for him to fulfill the aggregate of concentration. [16] (5) Having fulfilled the aggregate of concentration, it is possible for him to fulfill the aggregate of wisdom."

# 23 (3) Defilements

"Bhikkhus, ${ }^{984}$ there are these five defilements of gold, defiled by which gold is not malleable, wieldy, and luminous, but brittle and not properly fit for work. What five? Iron, copper, tin, lead, and silver. These are the five defilements of gold, defiled by which gold is not malleable, wieldy, and luminous, but brittle and not properly fit for work. But when gold is freed from these five defilements, it is malleable, wieldy, and luminous, pliant and properly fit for work. Then whatever kind of ornament one wishes to make from it-whether a bracelet, earrings, a necklace, or a golden garland-one can achieve one's purpose. ${ }^{985}$

"So too, bhikkhus, there are these five defilements of the mind, defiled by which the mind is not malleable, wieldy, and luminous, but brittle and not properly concentrated for the destruction of the taints. What five? Sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. These are the five defilements of the mind, defiled by which the mind is not malleable, wieldy, and luminous, but brittle and not properly concentrated for the destruction of the taints. But when the mind is freed from these five defilements, it becomes malleable, wieldy, [17] and luminous, pliant and properly concentrated for the destruction of the taints. Then, there being a suitable basis, one is capable of realizing any state realizable by direct knowledge toward which one might incline the mind. ${ }^{986}$

"If one wishes: 'May I wield the various kinds of psychic potency: having been one, may I become many; having been many, may I become one; may I appear and vanish; may I go unhindered through a wall, through a rampart, through a mountain as though through space; may I dive in and out of the earth as though it were water; may I walk on water without sinking as though it were earth; seated cross-legged; may I travel in space like a bird; with my hand may I touch and stroke
the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; may I exercise mastery with the body as far as the brahmā world,' one is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.

"If one wishes: 'May I, with the divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the human, hear both kinds of sounds, the divine and human, those that are far as well as near,' one is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.

"If one wishes: 'May I understand the minds of other beings and persons, having encompassed them with my own mind. May I understand a mind with lust as a mind with lust, and a mind without lust as a mind without lust; [18] a mind with hatred as a mind with hatred, and a mind without hatred as a mind without hatred; a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion, and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion; a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted; an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted; a surpassable mind as surpassable and an unsurpassable mind as unsurpassable; a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated; a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated,' one is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.

"If one wishes: 'May I recollect my manifold past abodes, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many eons of world-dissolution, many eons of world-evolution, many eons of world-dissolution and world-evolution thus: "There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere, and there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn here"-may I thus recollect my manifold past abodes with their aspects and details,' one is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis. [19]

"If one wishes: 'May I, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, see beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and understand how beings fare in accordance
with their kamma thus: "These beings who engaged in misconduct by body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong view, and undertook kamma based on wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; but these beings who engaged in good conduct by body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right view, and undertook kamma based on right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world"-thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, may I see beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and understand how beings fare in accordance with their kamma,' one is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.

"If one wishes: 'May I, with the destruction of the taints, in this very life realize for myself with direct knowledge the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, may I dwell in it,' one is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis."

# 24 (4) Immoral

"Bhikkhus, (1) for an immoral person, for one deficient in virtuous behavior, (2) right concentration lacks its proximate cause. When there is no right concentration, for one deficient in right concentration, (3) the knowledge and vision of things as they really are lacks its proximate cause. When there is no knowledge and vision of things as they really are, for one deficient in the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, (4) disenchantment and dispassion lack their proximate cause. When there is no disenchantment and dispassion, for one deficient in disenchantment and dispassion, (5) the knowledge and vision of liberation lacks its proximate cause. ${ }^{987}$

"Suppose there is a tree deficient in branches and foliage. Then its shoots do not grow to fullness; also its bark, [20] softwood, and heartwood do not grow to fullness. So too, for an immoral person, one deficient in virtuous behavior, right concentration lacks its proximate cause. When there is no right concentration ... the knowledge and vision of liberation lacks its proximate cause.
"Bhikkhus, (1) for a virtuous person, for one whose behavior is virtuous, (2) right concentration possesses its proximate cause. When there is right concentration, for one possessing right concentration, (3) the knowledge and vision of things as they really are possesses its proximate cause. When there is the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, for one possessing the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, (4) disenchantment and dispassion possess their proximate cause. When there is disenchantment and dispassion, for one possessing disenchantment and dispassion; (5) the knowledge and vision of liberation possesses its proximate cause:

"Suppose there is a tree possessing branches and foliage. Then its shoots grow to fullness; also its bark, softwood, and heartwood grow to fullness. So too, for a virtuous person, one whose behavior is virtuous, right concentration possesses its proximate cause. When there is right concentration... the knowledge and vision of liberation possesses its proximate cause."

# 25 (5) Assisted

"Bhikkhus, when right view is assisted by five factors, it has liberation of mind as its fruit, liberation of mind as its fruit and benefit; it has liberation by wisdom as its fruit, liberation by wisdom as its fruit and benefit. ${ }^{988}$ What five? [21] Here, right view is assisted by virtuous behavior, learning, discussion, calm, and insight. When right view is assisted by these five factors, it has liberation of mind as its fruit, liberation of mind as its fruit and benefit; it has liberation by wisdom as its fruit, liberation by wisdom as its fruit and benefit."

## 26 (6) Liberation

"Bhikkhus, there are these five bases of liberation ${ }^{989}$ by means of which, if a bhikkhu dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute, his unliberated mind is liberated, his undestroyed taints are utterly destroyed, and he reaches the as-yet-unreached unsurpassed security from bondage. What five?

(1) "Here, bhikkhus, the Teacher or a fellow monk in the position of a teacher teaches the Dhamma to a bhikkhu. In whatever way the Teacher or that fellow monk in the position of a teacher teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhu, in just that way he experiences inspiration in the meaning and inspiration in
the Dhamma. ${ }^{990}$ As he does so, joy arises in him. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. ${ }^{991}$ This is the first basis of liberation, by means of which, if a bhikkhu dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute, his unliberated mind is liberated, his undestroyed taints are utterly destroyed, and he reaches the as-yet-unreached unsurpassed security from bondage.

(2) "Again, neither the Teacher nor a fellow monk in the position of a teacher teaches the Dhamma to a bhikkhu, but he himself teaches the Dhamma to others in detail as he has heard it and learned it. In whatever way the bhikkhu [22] teaches the Dhamma to others in detail as he has heard it and learned it, in just that way, in relation to that Dhamma, he experiences inspiration in the meaning and inspiration in the Dhamma. As he does so, joy arises in him: When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is the second basis of liberation, by means of which, if a bhikkhu dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute, his unliberated mind is liberated, his undestroyed taints are utterly destroyed, and he reaches the as-yet-unreached unsurpassed security from bondage.

(3) "Again, neither the Teacher nor a fellow monk in the position of a teacher teaches the Dhamma to a bhikkhu, nor does he himself teach the Dhamma to others in detail as he has heard it and learned it, but he recites the Dhamma in detail as he has heard it and learned it. In whatever way the bhikkhu recites the Dhamma in detail as he has heard it and learned it, in just that way, in relation to that Dhamma, he experiences inspiration in the meaning and inspiration in the Dhamma. As he does so, joy arises in him. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is the third basis of liberation, by means of which, if a bhikkhu dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute, his unliberated mind is liberated, his undestroyed taints are utterly destroyed, and he reaches the as-yet-unreached unsurpassed security from bondage.

(4) "Again, neither the Teacher nor a fellow monk in the
position of a teacher teaches the Dhamma to a bhikkhu, nor does he teach the Dhamma to others in detail as he has heard it and learned it, nor does he recite the Dhamma in detail as he has heard it and learned it, but he ponders, [23] examines, and mentally inspects the Dhamma as he has heard it and learned it. In whatever way the bhikkhu ponders, examines, and mentally inspects the Dhamma as he has heard it and learned it, in just that way, in relation to that Dhamma, he experiences inspiration in the meaning and inspiration in the Dhammá. As he does so, joy arises in him. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in. body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is the fourth basis of liberation, by means of which, if a bhikkhu dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute, his unliberated mind is liberated, his undestroyed taints are utterly destroyed, and he reaches the as-yet-unreached unsurpassed security from bondage.

(5) "Again, neither the Teacher nor a fellow monk in the position of a teacher teaches the Dhamma to a bhikkhu, nor does he teach the Dhamma to others in detail as he has heard it and learned it, nor does he recite the Dhamma in detail as he has heard it and learned it, nor does he ponder, examine, and mentally inspect the Dhamma as he has heard it and learned it, but he has grasped well a certain object of concentration, attended to it well, sustained it well, and penetrated it well with wisdom. In whatever way the bhikkhu has grasped well a certain object of concentration, attended to it well, sustained it well, and penetrated it well with wisdom, in just that way, in relation to that Dhamma, he experiences inspiration in the meaning and inspiration in the Dhamma. As he does so, joy arises in him. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is the fifth basis of liberation, by means of which, if a bhikkhu dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute, [24] his unliberated mind is liberated, his undestroyed taints are utterly destroyed, and he reaches the as-yet-unreached unsurpassed security from bondage.

"These, bhikkhus, are the five bases of liberation, by means of which, if a bhikkhu dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute, his
unliberated mind is liberated, his undestroyed taints are utterly destroyed, and he reaches the as-yet-unreached unsurpassed security from bondage."

# 27 (7) Concentration

"Bhikkhus, being alert and mindful, develop concentration that is measureless. ${ }^{992}$ When, alert and mindful, you develop concentration that is measureless, five kinds of knowledge arise that are personally yours. What five? (1) The knowledge arises that is personally yours: 'This concentration is presently pleasant and in the future has a pleasant result.' (2) The knowledge arises that is personally yours: 'This concentration is noble and spiritual.' (3) The knowledge arises that is personally yours: 'This concentration is not practiced by low persons.' (4) The knowledge arises that is personally yours: 'This concentration is peaceful and sublime, gained by full tranquilization, and attained to unification; it is not reined in and checked by forcefully suppressing [the defilements]. ${ }^{993}$ (5) The knowledge arises that is personally yours: 'I enter this concentration ${ }^{994}$ mindfully and I emerge from it mindfully.' Bhikkhus, being alert and continuously mindful, develop concentration that is measureless. When you are alert and mindful, developing concentration that is measureless, these five kinds of knowledge arise that are personally yours." [25]

## 28 (8) Five-Factored

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you the development of noble fivefactored right concentration. ${ }^{995}$ Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"And what, bhikkhus, is the development of noble fivefactored right concentration?

(1) "Here, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. He makes the rapture and happiness born of seclusion drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the rapture and happiness born of seclusion.

Just as a skillful bath man or a bath man's apprentice might heap bath powder in a metal basin and, sprinkling it gradually with water, would knead it until the moisture wets his ball of bath powder, soaks it, and pervades it inside and out, yet the ball itself does not ooze; so too, the bhikkhu makes the rapture and happiness born of seclusion drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the rapture and happiness bom of seclusion. This is the first development of noble five-factored right concentration.

(2) "Again, with the subsiding of thought and examination, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration, without thought and examination. He makes the rapture and happiness born of concentration drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the rapture and happiness born of concentration. Just as there might be a lake whose waters welled up from below with no inflow from east, west, north, [26] or south, and the lake would not be replenished from time to time by showers of rain, then the cool fount of water welling up in the lake would make the cool water drench, steep, fill, and pervade the lake, so that there would be no part of the whole lake that is not pervaded by cool water; so too, the bhikkhu makes the rapture and happiness born of concentration drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the rapture and happiness born of concentration. This is the second development of noble five-factored right concentration.

(3) "Again, with the fading away as well of rapture, a bhikkhu dwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, he experiences pleasure with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: 'He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.' He makes the happiness divested of rapture drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the happiness divested of rapture. Just as, in a pond of blue or red or white lotuses, some lotuses that are born and grow in the water might thrive immersed in the water without rising out of it, and cool water would drench, steep, fill, and
pervade them to their tips and their roots, so that there would be no part of those lotuses that would not be pervaded by cool water; so too, the bhikkhu makes the happiness divested of rapture.drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the happiness divested of rapture. This is the third development of noble five-factored right concentration.

(4) "Again, with the abandoning of pleasure [27] and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity. He sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind, so that there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the pure bright mind. Just as a man might be sitting covered from the head down with a white cloth, so that there would be no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the white cloth; so too, the bhikkhu sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind, so that there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the pure bright mind. This is the fourth development of noble five-factored right concentration.

(5) "Again, a bhikkhu has grasped well the object of reviewing, ${ }^{996}$ attended to it well, sustained it well, and penetrated it well with wisdom. Just as one person might look upon another-as one standing might look upon one sitting down, or one sitting down might look upon one lying down-so too, a bhikkhu has grasped well the object of reviewing, attended to it well, sustained it well, and penetrated it well with wisdom. This is the fifth development of noble five-factored right concentration.

"When, bhikkhus, noble five-factored right concentration has been developed and cultivated in this way, then, there being a suitable basis, he is capable of realizing any state realizable by direct knowledge toward which he might incline his mind. ${ }^{997}$

"Suppose a water jug full of water has been set out on a stand, the jug being full of water right up to the brim so that crows could drink from it. If a strong man would tip it in any direction, would water come out?"

"Yes, [28] Bhante."

"So too, bhikkhus, when noble five-factored right concentration has been developed and cultivated in this way, then, there being a suitable basis, he is capable of realizing any state
realizable by direct knowledge toward which he might incline his mind.

"Suppose on level ground there was a four-sided pond, contained by an embankment, full of water right up to the brim so that crows could drink from it. If a strong man were to remove the embankment on any side, would water come out?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"So too, bhikkhus, when noble five-factored right concentration has been developed and cultivated in this way, then, there being a suitable basis, he is capable of realizing any state realizable by direct knowledge toward which he might incline his mind.

"Suppose on even ground at a crossroads a chariot was standing harnessed to thoroughbreds, with a goad ready at hand, so that a skillful trainer, the charioteer, could mount it, and taking the reins in his left hand and the goad in his right, might drive out and return wherever and whenever he likes. So too, bhikkhus, when noble five-factored right concentration has been developed and cultivated in this way, then, there being a suitable basis, he is capable of realizing any state realizable by direct knowledge toward which he might incline his mind.

"If he wishes: 'May I wield the various kinds of psychic potency: [29] having been one, may I become many ... [here and below as in 5:23]... may I exercise mastery with the body as far as the brahmā world,' he is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.

"If he wishes: 'May I, with the divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the human, hear both kinds of sounds, the divine and human, those that are far as well as near,' he is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.

"If he wishes: 'May I understand the minds of other beings and persons, having encompassed them with my own mind. May I understand . . . an unliberated mind as unliberated,' he is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.

"If he wishes:'May I recollect my manifold past abodes . . . with their aspects and details,' he is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.

"If he wishes: 'May I, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, see beings passing away and being reborn . . . and understand how beings fare in accordance with
their kamma,' he is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.

"If he wishes: 'May I, with the destruction of the taints, in this very life realize for myself with direct knowledge the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, may I dwell in it,' he is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis."

# 29 (9) Walking Meditation

"Bhikkhus, there are these five benefits of walking meditation. What five? [30] One becomes capable of journeys; one becomes capable of striving; one becomes healthy; what one has eaten, drunk, consumed, and tasted is properly digested; the concentration attained through walking meditation is long lasting. ${ }^{998}$ These are the five benefits of walking meditation."

## 30 (10) Nagita

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Sangha of bhikkhus when he reached the Kosalan brahmin village named Icchānañgala. There the Blessed One dwelled in the Icchānañgala woodland thicket. The brahmin householders of Icchānañgala heard: "It is said that the ascetic Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan family, has arrived at Icchānañgala and is now dwelling in the Icchānañgala woodland thicket. Now a good report about that Master Gotama has circulated thus: 'That Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One. Having realized by his own direct knowledge this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, he makes it known to others. He teaches a Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; he reveals a spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure.' Now it is good to see such arahants."

Then, when the night had passed, the brahmin householders of Icchānañgala took abundant food of various kinds and went
to the Icchānañgala woodland thicket. They stood outside the entrance making an uproar and a racket. [31] Now on that occasion the Venerable Nāgita was the Blessed One's attendant. The Blessed One addressed the Venerable Nāgita: "Who is making such an uproar and a racket, Nāgita? One would think it was fishermen at a haul of fish."

"Bhante, these are the brahmin householders of Icchānañgala who have brought abundant food of various kinds. They are standing outside the entrance, [wishing to offer it] to the Blessed One and the Sangha of bhikkhus."

"Let me never come upon fame, Nāgita, and may fame never catch up with me. One who does not gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, this bliss of renunciation, bliss of solitude, bliss of peace, bliss of enlightenment that I gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, might accept that vile pleasure, that slothful pleasure, the pleasure of gain, honor, and praise."

"Let the Blessed One now consent, Bhante, let the Fortunate One consent. This is now the time for the Blessed One to consent. Wherever the Blessed One will go now, the brahmin householders of town and countryside will incline in the same direction. Just as, when thick drops of rain are pouring down, the water flows down along the slope, so too, wherever the Blessed One will go now, the brahmin householders of town and country will incline in the same direction. For what reason? Because of the Blessed One's virtuous behavior and wisdom."

"Let me never come upon fame, Nāgita, and may fame never catch up with me. One who does not gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, this bliss of renunciation . . . might accept that vile pleasure, that slothful pleasure, the pleasure of gain, honor, and praise. [32]

(1) "Nāgita, what is eaten, drunk, consumed, and tasted winds up as feces and urine: this is its outcome. (2) From the change and alteration of things that are dear arise sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish: this is its outcome. (3) For one devoted to practicing meditation on the mark of unattractiveness, revulsion toward the mark of the beautiful becomes established: this is its outcome. (4) For one who dwells contemplating impermanence in the six bases for contact, revulsion toward contact becomes established: this is its outcome. (5) For one who dwells contemplating arising and vanishing in the
five aggregates subject to clinging, revulsion toward clinging becomes established: this is its outcome." ${ }^{\prime 999}$

# IV. SuMANĀ

## 31 (1) Sumanā

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇ̣ika's Park. Then Princess Sumana, ${ }^{1000}$ accompanied by five hundred chariots and five hundred court girls, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side: Princess Sumana then said to the Blessed One:

"Here, Bhante, there might be two disciples of the Blessed One equal in faith, virtuous behavior, and wisdom, but one is generous while the other is not. With the breakup of the body, [33] after death, they would both be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. When they have become devas, would there be any distinction or difference between them?"

"There would be, Sumana," the Blessed One said. "The generous one, having become a deva, would surpass the other in five ways: in celestial life span, celestial beauty, celestial happiness, celestial glory, and celestial authority. The generous one, having become a deva, would surpass the other in these five ways."

"But, Bhante, if these two pass away from there and again become human beings, would there still be some distinction or difference between them?"

"There would be, Sumana," the Blessed One said. "When they again become human beings, the generous one would surpass the other in five ways: in human life span, human beauty, human happiness, human fame, and human authority. When they again become human beings, the generous one would surpass the other in these five ways."

"But, Bhante, if these two should go forth from the household life into homelessness, would there still be some distinction or difference between them?"

"There would be, Sumana," the Blessed One said. "The generous one, having gone forth, would surpass the other in five ways. ${ }^{1001}$ (1) He would usually use a robe that has been specifically offered to him, seldom one that had not been specifically
offered to him. (2) He would usually eat almsfood that has been specifically offered to him, seldom almsfood that had not been specifically offered to him. (3) He would usually use a lodging that had been specifically offered to him, seldom one that had not been specifically offered to him. (4) He would usually use medicines and provisions for the sick that had been specifically offered to him, seldom those that had not been specifically offered to him. (5) His fellow monastics, those with whom he dwells, would usually behave toward him in agreeable ways by bodily, verbal, and mental action, seldom in disagreeable ways. They would usually present him what is agreeable, seldom [34] what is disagreeable. The generous one, having gone forth, would surpass the other in these five ways."

"But, Bhante, if both attain arahantship, would there still be some distinction or difference between them after they have attained arahantship?"

"In this case, Sumanā, I declare, there would be no difference between the liberation [of one] and the liberation [of the other]."

"It's astounding and amazing, Bhante! Truly, one has good reason to give alms and do meritorious deeds, since they will be helpful if one becomes a deva, [again] becomes a human being, or goes forth."

"So it is, Sumanā! So it is, Sumanā! Truly, one has good reason to give alms and do meritorious deeds, since they will be helpful if one becomes a deva, [again] becomes a human being, or goes forth."

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:

"As the stainless moon

moving through the sphere of space

outshines with its radiance

all the stars in the world,

so one accomplished in virtuous behavior,

a person endowed with faith,

outshines by generosity

all the misers in the world.
"As the hundred-peaked rain cloud, thundering, wreathed in lightning, pours down rain upon the earth, inundating the plains and lowlands, so the Perfectly Enlightened One's disciple, the wise one accomplished in vision, surpasses the miserly person in five specific respects:

life span and glory, beauty and happiness. ${ }^{1002}$

Possessed of wealth, after death he rejoices in heaven." [35]

# 32 (2) Cundi ${ }^{1003}$

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. Then Princess Cundi, ${ }^{1004}$ accompanied by five hundred chariots and five hundred court girls, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Princess Cundi then said to the Blessed One:

"Bhante, my brother is Prince Cunda. He says thus: 'Whenever a man or a woman has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and abstains from the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from indulging in liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn only in a good destination, not in a bad destination.' I ask the Blessed One: 'What kind of teacher, Bhante, should one have confidence in, so that, with the breakup of the body, after death, one is reborn only in a good destination, not in a bad destination? What kind of Dhamma should one have confidence in, so that, with the breakup of the body, after death, one is reborn only in a good destination, not in a bad destination? What kind of Sangha should one have confidence in, so that, with the breakup of the body, after death, one is reborn only in a good destination, not in a bad destination? What kind of virtuous behavior should one fulfill so that, with the breakup of the body, after death, one is reborn only in a good destination, not in a bad destination?"
(1) "Cundi, to whatever extent there are beings, whether footless or with two feet, four feet, or many feet, whether having form or formless, whether percipient, non-percipient, or neither percipient nor non-percipient, the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One is declared the foremost among them. Those who have confidence in the Buddha have confidence in the foremost, and for those who have confidence in the foremost, the result is foremost.

(2) "To whatever extent, Cundī, there are phenomena that are conditioned, the noble eightfold path is declared the foremost among them. Those who have confidence in the noble eightfold path have confidence in the foremost, and for those who have confidence in the foremost, the result is foremost. ${ }^{1005}$

(3) "To whatever extent, Cundī, there are phenomena whether conditioned or unconditioned, dispassion is declared the foremost among them, that is, the crushing of pride, the removal of thirst, the uprooting of attachment, the termination of the round, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, nibbāna. Those who [36] have confidence in the Dhamma, in dispassion, ${ }^{1006}$ have confidence in the foremost, and for those who have confidence in the foremost, the result is foremost.

(4) "To whatever extent, Cundī, there are Sanghas or groups, the Sangha of the Tathāgata's disciples is declared the foremost among them, that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals-this Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world. Those who have confidence in the Sangha have confidence in the foremost, and for those who have confidence in the foremost, the result is foremost.

(5) "To whatever extent, Cundī, there is virtuous behavior, the virtuous behavior loved by the noble ones is declared the foremost among them, that is, when it is unbroken, flawless, unblemished, unblotched, freeing, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading to concentration. Those who fulfill the virtuous behavior loved by the noble ones fulfill the foremost, and for those who fulfill the foremost, the result is foremost."

For those confident in regard to the foremost, ${ }^{1007}$ knowing the foremost Dhamma,
confident in the Buddha-the foremostunsurpassed, worthy of offerings;

for those confident in the foremost Dhamma, in the blissful peace of dispassion; for those confident in the foremost Sangha, the unsurpassed field of merit;

for those giving gifts to the foremost, the foremost kind of merit increases: the foremost life span, beauty, and glory, good reputation, happiness, and strength.

The wise one who gives to the foremost, concentrated upon the foremost Dhamma, having become a deva or human being, rejoices having attained the foremost.

# 33 (3) Uggaha

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Bhaddiya in the Jātiyā Grove. Then Uggaha, Mendaka's grandson, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down tc one side, and said to the Blessed One:

"Bhante, let the Blessed One together with three other monks ${ }^{1008}$ consent to accept tomorrow's [37] meal from me."

The Blessed One consented by silence. Then Uggaha, having understood that the Blessed One had consented, rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed.

Then, when the night had passed, in the morning the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and went to Uggaha's residence, where he sat down on the appointed seat. Then, with his own hands, Uggaha, Mendaka's grandson, served and satisfied the Blessed One with various kinds of delicious food.

When the Blessed One had finished eating and had put away his bowl, Uggaha sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, these girls of mine will be going to their husbands' families. Let the Blessed One exhort them and instruct them in a way that will lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time."

The Blessed One then said to those girls:

(1) "So then, girls, you should train yourselves thus: 'To whichever husband our parents give us-doing so out of a desire for our good, seeking our welfare, taking compassion on us, acting out of compassion for us-we will rise before him and retire after him, undertaking whatever needs to be done, agreeable in our conduct and pleasing in our speech.' Thus should you train yourselves.

(2) "And you should train yourselves thus: 'We will honor, respect, esteem, and venerate those whom our husband respects-his mother and father, ascetics and brahmins-and when they arrive we will offer them a seat and water.' Thus should you train yourselves.

(3) "And you should train yourselves thus: 'We will be skillful and diligent in attending to our husband's domestic chores, whether knitting or weaving; we will possess sound judgment about them in order to carry out and arrange them properly.' Thus should you train yourselves.

(4) "And you should train yourselves thus: 'We will find out what our husband's domestic helpers-whether slaves, messengers, or [38] workers-have done and left undone; we will find out the condition of those who are ill; and we will distribute to each an appropriate portion of food.' Thus should you train yourselves:

(5) "And you should train yourselves thus: 'We will guard and protect whatever income our husband brings homewhether money or grain, silver or gold-and we will not be spendthrifts; thieves, wastrels, or squanderers of his earnings.' Thus should you train yourselves.

"When, girls, a woman possesses these five qualities, with the breakup of the body, after death, she is reborn in companionship with the agreeable-bodied devas."1009

She does not despise her husband, the man who constantly supports her, who ardently and eagerly

always brings her whatever she wants.

Nor does a good woman scold her husband with speech caused by jealousy; ${ }^{1010}$
the wise woman shows veneration to all those whom her husband reveres.

She rises early, works diligently, manages the domestic help; she treats her husband in agreeable ways and safeguards the wealth he earns.

The woman who fulfills her duties thus, following her husband's will and wishes, is reborn among the devas called "the agreeable ones."

# 34 (4) Stha

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then Sitha the general approached [39] the Blessed One, paid homage to him; sat down to one side, and said: ${ }^{1011}$

"Is it possible, Bhante, to point out a directly visible fruit of giving?"1012

"It is, Sihá," the Blessed One said.

(1) "A donor, Sīha, a munificent giver, is dear and agreeable to many people. This is a directly visible fruit of giving.

(2) "Again, good persons resort to a donor, a munificent giver. This, too, is a directly visible fruit of giving.

(3) "Again, a donor, a munificent giver, acquires a good reputation. This, too, is a directly visible fruit of giving.

(4) "Again, whatever assembly a donor, a munificent giver, approaches-whether of khattiyas, brahmins, householders, or ascetics-he approaches it confidently and composed. ${ }^{1013}$ This too is a directly visible fruit of giving.

(5) "Again, with the breakup of the body, after death, a donor, a munificent giver, is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. This is a fruit of giving pertaining to future lives."1014

When this was said, Sīha the general said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, I do not go by faith in the Blessed One concerning those four directly visible fruits of giving declared by him. I know them, too. For I am a donor, a munificent giver, and I am dear and agreeable to many people. I am a donor, a munificent giver, and many good persons resort to me. I am a donor,
a munificent giver, and I have acquired a good reputation as a donor, sponsor, and supporter of the Sangha. I [40] am a donor, a munificent giver, and whatever assembly I approachwhether of khattiyas, brahmins, householders, or ascetics-I approach it confidently and composed. I do not go by faith in the Blessed One concerning these four directly visible fruits of giving declared by him. I know them, too. But when the Blessed One tells me: 'Sîha, with the breakup of the body, after death, a donor, a munificent giver, is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world,' I do not know this, and here I go by faith in the Blessed One."

"So it is, Siha, so it is! With the breakup of the body, after death, a donor, a munificent giver, is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world."

By giving, he becomes dear and many resort to him. He attains a good reputation and his fame increases. The generous man is composed and confidently enters the assembly.

Therefore, seeking happiness, wise persons give gifts, having removed the stain of miserliness. When they are settled in the triple heaven, for a long time they delight in companionship with the devas.

Having taken the opportunity to do wholesome deeds, passing from here, self-luminous, they roam in

Nandana, ${ }^{1015}$

where they delight, rejoice, and enjoy themselves, furnished with the five objects of sensual pleasure.

Having fulfilled the word of the unattached Stable One, the Fortunate One's disciples rejoice in heaven. [41]

35 (5) The Benefits of Giving

"Bhikkhus, there are these five benefits of giving. What five? (1) One is dear and agreeable to many people. (2) Good persons resort to one. (3) One acquires a good reputation. (4) One is
not deficient in the layperson's duties. (5) With the breakup of the body, after death, one is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. These are the five benefits in giving."

By giving, one becomes dear, one follows the duty of the good; the good self-controlled monks always resort to one.

They teach one the Dhamma that dispels all suffering, having understood which the taintless one here attains nibbāna.

# 36 (6) Timely

"Bhikkhus, there are these five timely gifts. What five? (1) One gives a gift to a visitor. (2) One gives a gift to one setting out on a journey. (3) One gives a gift to a patient. (4) One gives a gift during a famine. (5) One first presents the newly harvested crops and fruits to the virtuous ones. These are the five timely gifts."

At the proper time, those wise, charitable, and generous folk give a timely gift to the noble ones, who are stable and upright; given with a clear mind, one's offering is vast.

Those who rejoice in such deeds or who provide [other] service do not miss out on the offering; they too partake of the merit.

Therefore, with a non-regressing mind, one should give a gift where it yields great fruit. Merits are the support of living beings [when they arise] in the other world. [42]

# 37 (7) Food

"Bhikkhus, a donor who gives food gives the recipients five things. What five? One gives life, beauty, happiness, strength, and discernment. ${ }^{1016}$ (1) Having given life, one partakes of life, whether celestial or human. (2) Having given beauty, one partakes of beauty, whether celestial or human. (3) Having given happiness, one partakes of happiness, whether celestial or human. (4) Having given strength, one partakes of strength, whether celestial or human. (5) Having given discernment, one partakes of discernment, whether celestial or human. A donor who gives food gives the recipients these five things."

The wise one is a giver of life, strength, beauty, and discernment.

The intelligent one is a donor of happiness and in turn acquires happiness.

Having given life, strength, beauty, happiness, and discernment, one is long-lived and famous wherever one is reborn.

## 38 (8) Faith

"Bhikkhus, these five benefits come to a clansman endowed with faith. What five? (1) When the good persons in the world show compassion, ${ }^{1017}$ they first show compassion to the person with faith, not so to the person without faith. (2) When they approach anyone, they first approach the person with faith, not so the person without faith. (3) When they receive alms, they first receive alms from the person with faith, not so from the person without faith. (4) When they teach the Dhamma, they first teach the Dhamma to the person with faith, not so to the person without faith. (5) With the breakup of the body, after death, a person with faith is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. These are the five benefits that come to a clansman who has faith.

"Just as at a crossroads on level ground, a great banyan tree becomes the resort for birds all around, so [43] the clansman endowed with faith becomes the resort for many people:
for bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, male lay followers, and female lay followers."

A large tree with a mighty trunk, branches, leaves, and fruit, firm roots, and bearing fruit, is a support for many birds.

Having flown across the sky, the birds resort to this delightful base: those in need of shade partake of its shade; those needing fruit enjoy its fruit.

Just so, when a person is virtuous, endowed with faith, of humble manner, compliant, gentle, welcoming, soft, those in the world who are fields of meritdevoid of lust and hatred, devoid of delusion, taintlessresort to such a person.

They teach him the Dhamma that dispels all suffering, having understood which the taintless one here attains nibbāna.

39 (9) Son

"Bhikkhus, considering five prospects, mother and father wish for a son to be born in their family. What five? (1) 'Having been supported by us, he will support us. (2) Or he will do work for us. (3) Our family lineage will be extended. (4) He will manage the inheritance, (5) or else, when we have passed on, he will give an offering on our behalf.' Considering these five prospects, mother and father wish for a son to be born in their family."

Considering the five prospects, wise people wish for a son.

"Supported by us, he will support us, or he will do work for us.

The family lineage will be extended, he will manage the inheritance, or else, when we have passed on, he will make an offering on our behalf."

Considering these prospects, wise people wish for a son.

Therefore good persons, grateful and appreciative, support their mother and father, recalling how they helped one in the past; [44] they do what is necessary for them as they did for oneself in the past.

Following their advice, nurturing those who brought him up, continuing the family lineage, endowed with faith, virtuous: this son is worthy of praise.

40 (10) Sal Trees ${ }^{1018}$

"Bhikkhus, based on the Himalayas, the king of mountains, great sal trees grow in five ways. What five? (1) They grow in branches, leaves, and foliage; (2) they grow in bark; (3) they grow in shoots; (4) they grow in softwood; and (5) they grow in heartwoud. Based on the Himalayas, the king of mountains, great sal trees grow in these five ways.

"So too, when the head of the family ${ }^{1019}$ is endowed with faith, the people in the family who depend on him grow in five ways. What five? (1) They grow in faith; (2) they grow in virtuous behavior; (3) they grow in learning; (4) they grow in generosity; and (5) they grow in wisdom. When the head of a family is endowed with faith, the people in the family who depend on him grow in these five ways."

just as the trees that grow

in dependence on a rocky mountain

in a vast forest wilderness

might become great 'woodland lords,'
so, when the head of a family here possesses faith and virtue, his wife, children, and relatives all grow in dependence on him; so too his companions, his family circle, and those dependent on him.

Those possessed of discernment, seeing that virtuous man's good conduct, his generosity and good deeds, emulate his example.

Having lived here in accord with Dhamma, the path leading to a good destination, those who desire sensual pleasures rejoice, delighting in the deva world: [45]

# V. MuNDA THE KING

## 41 (1) Utilization

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Then the householder Anāthapindika approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Householder, there are these five utilizations of wealth. What five? ${ }^{1020}$

(1) "Here, householder, with wealth acquired by energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained, the noble disciple makes himself happy and pleased and properly maintains himself in happiness; he makes his parents happy and pleased and properly maintains them in happiness; he makes his wife and children, his slaves, workers, and servants happy and pleased and properly maintains them in happiness. This is the first utilization of wealth.

(2) "Again, with wealthacquired by energetic striving... righteously gained, the noble disciple makes his friends and companions happy and pleased and properly maintains them in happiness. This is the second utilization of wealth.
(3) "Again, with wealth acquired by energetic striving ...righteously gained, the noble disciple makes provisions with his wealth against the losses that might arise because of fire or floods, kings or bandits or unloved heirs; he makes himself secure against them. This is the third utilization of wealth.

(4) "Again, with wealth acquired by energetic striving ...righteously gained, the noble disciple makes the five oblations: to relatives, guests, ancestors, the king, and the deities. This is the fourth utilization of wealth.

(5) "Again, with wealth acquired by energetic striving ... [46]...righteously gained, the noble disciple establishes an uplifting offering of alms-an offering that is heavenly, resulting in happiness, conducive to heaven-to those ascetics and brahmins who refrain from intoxication and heedlessness, who are settled in patience and mildness, who tame themselves, calm themselves, and train themselves for nibbāna. This is the fifth utilization of wealth.

"These, householder, are the five utilizations of wealth. Householder, if a noble disciple's wealth is exhausted when he has utilized it in these five ways, he thinks: 'I have utilized wealth in these five ways and my wealth is exhausted.' Thus he has no regret. But if a noble disciple's wealth increases when he has utilized it in these five ways, he thinks: 'I have utilized wealth in these five ways and my wealth has increased.' Thus, either way, he has no regret."

"I've enjoyed wealth, supported my dependents, and overcome adversities.

I have given an uplifting offering, and performed the five oblations. I have served the virtuous monks, the self-controlled celibate ones.

"I have achieved whatever purpose a wise person, dwelling at home, might have in desiring wealth; what I have done brings me no regret."

Recollecting this, a mortal remains firm in the noble Dhamma.

They praise him here in this life, and after death he rejoices in heaven.

# 42 (2) The Good Person

"Bhikkhus, when a good person is born in a family, it is for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people. It is for the good, welfare, and happiness of (1) his mother and father, (2) his wife and children, (3) his slaves, workers, and servants, (4) his friends and companions, and (5) ascetics and brahmins. Just as a great rain cloud, nurturing all the crops, appears for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people, so too, [47] when a good person is born in a family, it is for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people. It is for the good, welfare, and happiness of his mother and father... ascetics and brahmins."

The deities protect one guarded by the Dhamma, ${ }^{1021}$ who has managed his wealth for the welfare of many. Fame does not forsake one steadfast in the Dhamma, who is learned and of virtuous behavior and observances.

Who is fit to blame him, standing in Dhamma, accomplished in virtuous behavior, a speaker of truth, possessing a sense of shame, [pure] like a coin of refined gold?

Even the devas praise him;

by Brahmā, too, he is praised.

## 43 (3) Wished For

Then the householder Anathapiṇdika approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Householder, there are these five things that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world. What five? Long life, householder, is wished for, desired, agreeable, and
rarely gained in the world. Beauty . . . Happiness . . . Fame . . . The heavens are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world. These are the five things that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world. ${ }^{1022}$

"These five things, householder, that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world, I say, are not obtained by means of prayers or aspirations. If these five things that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world could be obtained by means of prayers [48] or aspirations, who here would be lacking in anything?

(1) "Householder, the noble disciple who desires long life ought not to pray for long life or delight in it or [passively] yearn for it. ${ }^{1023}$ A noble disciple, who desires long life should practice the way conducive to long life. ${ }^{1024}$ For when he practices the way conducive to long life, it leads to obtaining long life, and he gains long life either celestial or human.

(2) "Householder, the noble disciple who desires beauty... (3) ... who desires happiness... (4) ... who desires fame ought not to pray for fame or delight in it or [passively] yearn for it. A noble disciple who desires fame should practice the way conducive to fame. For when he practices the way conducive to fame, it leads to obtaining fame, and he gains fame either celestial or human.

(5) "Householder, the noble disciple who desires the heavens ought not to pray for the heavens or delight in them or [passively] yearn for them. A noble disciple who desires the heavens should practice the way conducive to heaven. For when he practices the way conducive to heaven, it leads to obtaining the heavens, and he gains the heavens."1025

For one desiring long life, beauty, fame, ${ }^{1026}$

acclaim, heaven, high families,

and lofty delights

following in succession,

the wise praise heedfulness

in doing deeds of merit. [49]

Being heedful, the wise person

secures both kinds of good:

the good in this' life,
and the good of the future life.

By attaining the good, ${ }^{1027}$ the steadfast one is called one of wisdom.

44 (4) The Giver of the Agreeable

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and went to the residence of the householder Ugga of Vesāli, where he sat down in the appointed seat. Then the householder Ugga of Vesāli approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to the Blessed One:

"Bhante, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learned this: 'The giver of what is agreeable gains what is agreeable.' Bhante, my sal flower porridge is agreeable. ${ }^{1028}$ Let the Blessed One accept it from me, out of compassion." The Blessed One accepted, out of compassion.

"Bhante, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learned this: 'The giver of what is agreeable gains what is agreeable.' Bhante, my pork embellished with jujubes is agreeable. ${ }^{1029}$ Let the Blessed One accept it from me, out of compassion." The Blessed One accepted, out of compassion.

"Bhante, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learned this: 'The giver of what is agreeable gains what is agreeable.' Bhante, my fried vegetable stalks are agreeable. ${ }^{1030}$ Let the Blessed One accept them from me, out of compassion." The Blessed One accepted, out of compassion.

"Bhante, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learned this: 'The giver of what is agreeable gains what is agreeable.' Bhante, my boiled hill rice cleared of dark grains, accompanied by various sauces and condiments, is agreeable. Let the Blessed One accept it from me, out of compassion." The Blessed One accepted, out of compassion. [50]

"Bhante, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learned this: 'The giver of what is agreeable gains what is agreeable.' Bhante, my cloths from Kāsi are agreeable. Let the Blessed One accept them from me, out of compassion." The Blessed One accepted, out of compassion.

"Bhante, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learned this: 'The giver of what is agreeable gains what is agreeable.'

Bhante, my couch spread with rugs, blankets, and covers, with an excellent covering of antelope hide, with a canopy above and red bolsters at both ends, is agreeable. Although I know this is not allowable for the Blessed One, this sandalwood plank of mine is worth over a thousand. ${ }^{1031}$ Let the Blessed One accept it from me, out of compassion." The Blessed One accepted, out of compassion.

Then the Blessed One expressed his appreciation to the householder Ugga of Vesālī thus:

"The giver of the agreeable gains the agreeable, when he gives willingly to the upright ones clothing, bedding, food, and drink, and various kinds of requisites.

"Having known the arahants to be like a field for what is relinquished and offered; not held back, ${ }^{1032}$ the good person gives what is hard to give: the giver of agreeable things gains what is agreeable."

Then, after expressing his appreciation to the householder Ugga of Vesālī, the Blessed One rose from his seat and left. Then, some time later, the householder Ugga of Vesālī passed away. After his death, the householder Ugga of Vesālī was reborn among a certain group of mind-made [deities]. ${ }^{1033}$ On that occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇ̣ika's Park. Then, when the night had advanced, the young deva Ugga, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire [51] Jeta's Grove, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. The Blessed One then said to him: "I hope, Ugga, that it is as you would have wished."

"Surely, Bhante, it is as I had wished."

Then the Blessed One addressed the young deva Ugga with verses:

"The giver of the agreeable gains the agreeable; the giver of the foremost again gains the foremost; the giver of the excellent gains the excellent; the giver of the best reaches the best state.
"The person who gives the best, the giver of the foremost, the giver of the excellent, is long-lived and famous wherever he is reborn." ${ }^{1034}$

45 (5) Streams ${ }^{1035}$

"Bhikkhus, there are these five streams of merit, streams of the wholesome, nutriments of happiness-heavenly, ripening in happiness, conducive to heaven-that lead to what is wished for, desired, and agreeable, to one's welfare and happiness. What five?

"(1) When a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a measureless concentration of mind while using a robe [that one has given him], one acquires a measureless stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, a nutriment of happiness . . . that leads . . . to one's welfare and happiness. (2) When a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a measureless concentration of mind while using almsfood [that one has given him], one acquires a measureless stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, a nutriment of happiness... that leads ... to one's welfare and happiness. (3) When a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a measureless concentration of mind while using a dwelling [that one has given him], one acquires a measureless stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, a nutriment of happiness . . . that leads . . . to one's welfare and happiness. (4) When a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a measureless concentration of mind while using a bed and chair [that one has given him], one acquires a measureless stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, a nutriment of happiness . . . that leads ... to one's welfare and happiness. (5) When a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a measureless concentration of mind while using medicines and provisions for the sick [that one has given him], [52] one acquires a measureless stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, a nutriment of happiness ... that leads to one's welfare and happiness.

"These are the five streams of merit, streams of the wholesome, nutriments of happiness-heavenly, ripening in happiness, conducive to heaven-that lead to what is wished for, desired, and agreeable, to one's welfare and happiness.
"When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple possesses these five streams of merit, streams of the wholesome, it is not easy to measure his merit thus: 'Just so much is his stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, nutriment of happiness-heavenly ... that leads to ... one's welfare and happiness'; rather, it is reckoned simply as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit.

"Bhikkhus, just as it is not easy to measure the water in the great ocean thus: 'There are so many gallons of water,' or 'There are so many hundreds of gallons of water,' or 'There are so many thousands of gallons of water, ${ }^{1036}$ or 'There are so many hundreds of thousands of gallons of water,' but rather it is reckoned simply as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of water; so too, when a noble disciple possesses these five streams of merit . . . it is reckoned simply as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit."

Just as the many rivers used by the hosts of people, flowing downstream, reach the ocean, the great mass of water, the boundless sea, the fearsome receptacle of heaps of gems; [53] so the streams of merit reach the wise man who is a giver of food, drink, and cloth; [they reach] the donor of beds, seats, and covers like rivers carrying their waters to the sea.

# 46 (6) Accomplishments

"Bhikkhus, there are these five accomplishments. What five? Accomplishment in faith, accomplishment in virtuous behavior, accomplishment in learning, accomplishment in generosity, and accomplishment in wisdom. These are the five accomplishments."

## 47 (7) Wealth

"Bhikkhus, there are these five kinds of wealth. What five? The wealth of faith, the wealth of virtuous behavior, the wealth of learning, the wealth of generosity, and the wealth of wisdom.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the wealth of faith? Here, a noble disciple is endowed with faith. He places faith in the enlight-
enment of the Tathāgata thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' This is called the wealth of faith.

(2) "And what is the wealth of virtuous behavior? Here, a noble disciple abstains from the destruction of life, abstains from taking what is not given, abstains from sexual misconduct, abstains from false speech, abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. This is called the wealth of virtuous behavior.

(3) "And what is the wealth of learning? Here, a noble disciple has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and accumulates what he has learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life-such teachings as these he has learned much of, retained in mind, recited verbally, mentally investigated, and penetrated well by view. ${ }^{1657}$.

(4) "And what is the wealth of generosity? Here, a noble disciple dwells at home with a heart devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in relinquishment, devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing. This is called the wealth of generosity.

(5) "And what is the wealth of wisdom? Here, a noble disciple is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. This is called the wealth of wisdom.

"These, bhikkhus, are the five kinds of wealth." [54]

When one has faith in the Tathāgata, ${ }^{1038}$ unshakable and well established, and virtuous behavior that is good; loved and praised by the noble ones; when one has confidence in the Sangha and one's view has been straightened out, they say that one is not poor, that one's life is not lived in vain.

Therefore an intelligent person, remembering the Buddhas' teaching, should be intent on faith and virtuous behavior, confidence and vision of the Dhamma.

# 48 (8) Situations

"Bhikkhus, there are these five situations that are unobtainable by an ascetic or a brahmin, by a deva, Māra, or Brahmā, or by anyone in the world. What five? (1) 'May what is subject to old age not grow old!': this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic or a brahmin, by a deva, Māra, or Brahmā; or by anyone in the world. (2) 'May what is subject to illness not fall ill!': this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic... or by anyone in the world. (3) 'May what is subject to death not die!': this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic... or by anyone in the world. (4) 'May what is subject to destruction not be destroyed!': this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic... or by anyone in the world. (5) 'May what is subject to loss not be lost!': this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic or a brahmin, by a deva, Māra, or Brahmā, or by anyone in the world.

(1) "Bhikkhus, for the uninstructed worldling, what is subject to old age grows old. When this happens, he does not reflect thus: 'I am not the only one for whom what is subject to old age grows old. For all beings that come and go, that pass away and undergo rebirth, what is subject to old age grows old. If I were to sorrow, languish, lament, weep beating my breast, and become confused when what is subject to old age grows old, I would lose my appetite and my features would become ugly. I would not be able to do my work, my enemies would be elated, and my friends would become saddened.' Thus, when what is subject to old age grows old, he sorrows, languishes, laments, weeps beating his breast, and becomes confused. This is called an uninstructed worldling pierced by the poisonous dart of sorrow who only torments himself.

(2) "Again, for the uninstructed worldling, [55] what is subject to illness falls ill... (3) ... what is subject to death dies... (4) ... what is subject to destruction is destroyed ... (5) ... what is subject to loss is lost. When this happens, he does not reflect thus: 'I am not the only one for whom what is subject to loss
is lost. For all beings who come and go, who pass away and undergo rebirth, what is subject to loss is lost. If I were to sorrow, languish, lament, weep beating my breast, and become confused when what is subject to loss is lost, I would lose my appetite and my features would become ugly. I would not be able to do my work, my enemies would be elated, and my friends would become saddened.' Thus, when what is subject to loss is lost, he sorrows, languishes, laments, weeps beating his breast, and becomes confused. This is called an uninstructed worldling pierced by the poisonous dart of sorrow who only torments himself.

(1) "Bhikkhus, for the instructed noble disciple, what is subject to old age grows old. When this happens, he reflects thus: 'I am not the only one for whom what is subject to old age grows old. For all beings that come and go, that pass away and undergo rebirth, what is subject to old age grows old. If I were to sorrow, languish, lament, weep beating my breast, and become confused when what is subject to old age grows old, I would lose my appetite and my features would become ugly. I would not be able to do my work, my enemies would be elated, and my friends would become saddened.' Thus, when what is subject to old age grows old, he does not sorrow, languish, lament, weep beating his breast; and become confused. This is called an instructed noble disciple who has drawn out the poisonous dart of sorrow pierced by which the uninstructed worldling only torments himself. Sorrowless, without darts, the noble disciple realizes nibbāna. ${ }^{1039}$

(2) "Again, for the instructed noble disciple, what is subject to illness falls ill . . (3) . . . what is subject to death dies . . (4) . . . what is subject to destruction is destroyed . . (5) . . . what is subject to loss is lost. When this happens, he reflects thus: 'I am not the only one for whom what is subject to loss is lost. For all beings that come and go, that pass away and undergo rebirth, what is subject to loss [56] is lost. If I were to sorrow, languish, lament, weep beating my breast, and become confused when what is subject to loss is lost, I would lose my appetite and my features would become ugly. I would not be able to do my work, my enemies would be elated, and my friends would become saddened.' Thus, when what is subject to loss is lost, he does not sorrow, languish, lament, weep beating his breast, and become
confused. This is called an instructed noble disciple who has drawn out the poisonous dart of sorrow pierced by which the uninstructed worldling only torments himself. Sorrowless, without darts, the noble disciple realizes nibbāna.

"These, bhikkhus, are the five situations that are unobtainable by an ascetic or a brahmin, by a deva, Māra, or Brahmā, or by anyone in the world.

"It is not by sorrowing and lamenting that even the least good here can be gained. ${ }^{1040}$ Knowing that one is sorrowful and sad, one's enemies are elated.

"When the wise person does not shake in adversities, knowing how to determine what is good, his enemies are saddened, having seen that his former facial expression does not change.

"Wherever one might gain one's good, in whatever way-by chanting, mantras, maxims, gifts, or tradition ${ }^{1041}$-there one should exert oneself in just that way.

"But if one should understand: 'This good cannot be obtained by me or anyone else,' one should accept the situation without sorrowing, thinking: 'The kamma is strong; what can I do now?"' [57]

# 49 (9) Kosala

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. [Now on that occasion Queen Mallikā had just died. ${ }^{1042}$ Then a man approached King Pasendi and whispered in his ear: "Sire, Queen Mallikā has just died." When this was said, King Pasenadi was pained and saddened, and he sat there with slumping shoulders, facing downward, glum, and speechless.

Then the Blessed One, having known the king's condition, said to him:
"Great king, there are these five situations that are unobtainable by an ascetic or a brahmin, by a deva, Māra, or Brahmā, or by anyone in the world."

[The rest of this sutta is identical with 5:48, including the verses.]

# 50 (10) Nārada

On one occasion the Venerable Nārada was dwelling at Pātaliputta at the Cock's Park. Now on that occasion King Munda's [wife] Queen Bhaddā, who had been dear and beloved to him, had died. Since her death, he did not bathe, anoint himself, eat his meals, or undertake his work. Day and night, he remained brooding over Queen Bhaddā's body. Then King Munda addressed his treasurer, Piyaka: "Well then, friend Piyaka, [58] immerse Queen Bhaddā's body in an iron vat filled with oil and enclose it in another iron vat so that we can see Queen Bhaddā's body still longer."

"Yes, sire," the treasurer Piyaka replied. Then he immersed Queen Bhaddā's body in an iron vat filled with oil and enclosed it in another iron vat.

Then it occurred to the treasurer Piyaka: "King Munda's [wife] Queen Bhaddā has died, and she was dear and beloved to him. Since her death, he does not bathe, anoint himself, eat his meals, or undertake his work. Day and night, he remains brooding over the queen's body. What ascetic or brahmin can King Munda visit, so that, having heard his Dhamma, he might abandon the dart of sorrow?"

Then it occurred to Piyaka: "The Venerable Nārada is dwelling at Pātaliputta, in the Cock's Park. Now a good report about this Venerable Nārada has circulated thus: 'He is wise, competent, intelligent, learned, an artful speaker, eloquent, mature, and an arahant.' Suppose King Munda would visit the Venerable Nārada: perhaps if he hears the Venerable Nārada's Dhamma, he would abandon the dart of sorrow."

Then the treasurer Piyaka approached King Munda and said to him: "Sire, the Venerable Nārada is dwelling at Pātaliputta, in the Cock's Park. Now a good report about this Venerable Nārada has circulated thus: 'He is wise . . . and an arahant.' Your majesty should visit the Venerable Nārada. Perhaps, when you hear the Venerable Nārada's Dhamma, you would abandon the
dart of sorrow." [The king said:] "Well then, friend Piyaka, [59] inform the Venerable Nārada. For how can one like me think of approaching an ascetic or brahmin living in his realm without first informing him?"

"Yes, sire," Piyaka replied. Then he went to the Venerable Nārada, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: "Bhante, King Munḍa's [wife] Queen Bhaddā, who was dear and beloved to him, has died. Since the queen's death, he does not bathe, anoint himself, eat his meals, or undertake his work: Day and night, he remains brooding over the queen's body. It would be good, Bhante, if the Venerable Nārada would teach the Dhamma to King Munḍa in such a way that he can abandon the dart of sorrow."

"Then let King Munḍa come at his own convenience."

Then the treasurer Piyaka rose from his seat, paid homage to the Venerable Nārada, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and went to King Munḍa. He told the king: "Sire, the Venerable Nārada has given his consent. You may go at your own convenience."

"Well then, friend Piyaka, get the finest carriages harnessed!"

"Yes, sire," Piyaka replied, and after he had gotten the finest carriages harnessed he told King Munḍa: "Sire, the finest carriages have been harnessed. You may go at your own convenience."

Then King Munḍa mounted a fine carriage, and along with the other carriages he set out in full royal splendor for the Cock's Park to see the Venerable Nārada. He went by carriage as far as the ground was suitable for a carriage, and then he dismounted from his carriage and entered the park on foot. He approached the Venerable Nārada, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. [60] The Venerable Nārada then said to him:

"Great king, there are these five situations that are unobtainable by an ascetic or a brahmin, by a deva, Māra, or Brahmā, or by anyone in the world. What five? (1) 'May what is subject to old age not grow old!': this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic or a brahmin, by a deva, Māra, or Brahmā, or by anyone in the world. (2) 'May what is subject to illness not fall ill!': this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic... or by anyone in the world. (3) 'May what is subject to death not die!': this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic... or
by anyone in the world. (4) 'May what is subject to destruction not be destroyed!': this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic... or by anyone in the world. (5) 'May what is subject to loss not be lost!': this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic or a brahmin, by a deva, Māra, or Brahmā, or by anyone in the world.

[The sequel is identical to 5:48, including the verses.] [61-62]

When this was said, King Munda asked the Venerable Nārada: "Bhante, what is the name of this exposition of the Dhamma?"

"Great king, this exposition of the Dhamma is named the extraction of the dart of sorrow." ${ }^{1043}$

"Surely, Bhante, it is the extraction of the dart of sorrow! Surely, it is the extraction of the dart of sorrow! For having heard this exposition of the Dhamma, I have abandoned the dart of sorrow."

Then King Munḍa said to the treasurer Piyaka: "Well then, friend Piyaka, have Queen Bhaddā's body cremated and build a memorial mound for her. From today on, I will bathe and anoint myself and eat my meals and undertake my work." [63]

# The Second Fifty

## I. HINDRANCES

## 51 (1) Obstructions

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, there are these five obstructions, hindrances, encumbrances of the mind, states that weaken wisdom. What five? (1) Sensual desire is an obstruction, a hindrance, an encumbrance of the mind, a state that weakens wisdom. (2) Ill will... (3) Dullness and drowsiness ... (4) Restlessness and remorse ... (5) Doubt is an obstruction, a hindrance, an encumbrance of
the mind, a state that weakens wisdom. These are the five obstructions, hindrances, encumbrances of the mind, states that weaken wisdom.

"Bhikkhus, without having abandoned these five obstructions, hindrances, encumbrances of the mind, states that weaken wisdom, it is impossible that a bhikkhu, with his powerless and feeble wisdom, might know his own good, the good of others, [64] or the good of both; or realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. Suppose a river were flowing down from a mountain, traveling a long distance, with a swift current, carrying along much flotsam. Then, on both of its banks, a man would open irrigation channels. ${ }^{1044}$ In such a case, the current in the middle of the river would be dispersed, spread out, and divided, so that the river would no longer travel a long distance, with a swift current, carrying along much flotsam. So too, without having abandoned these five obstructions . . . it is impossible that a bhikkhu . . . might realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.

"But, bhikkhus, having abandoned these five obstructions, hindrances, encumbrances of the mind, states that weaken wisdom, it is possible that a bhikkhu, with his powerful wisdom, might know his own good, the good of others, and the good of both, and realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. Suppose a river were flowing down from a mountain, traveling a long distance, with a swift current, carrying along much flotsam. Then a man would close up the irrigation channels on both of its banks. In such a case, the current in the middle of the river would not be dispersed, spread out, and divided, so that the river could travel a long distance, with a swift current, carrying along much flotsam. So too, having abandoned these five obstructions . . . it is possible that a bhikkhu . . . might realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones." [65]

# 52 (2) A Heap

"Bhikkhus, saying 'a heap of the unwholesome,' it is about the five hindrances that one could rightly say this. ${ }^{1045}$ For the five hindrances are a complete heap of the unwholesome. What five? The hindrance of sensual desire, the hindrance of ill will, the
hindrance of dullness and drowsiness, the hindrance of restlessness and remorse, and the hindrance of doubt. Bhikkhus, saying 'a heap of the unwholesome,' it is about these five hindrances that one could rightly say this. For these five hindrances are a complete heap of the unwholesome."

# 53 (3) Factors

"Bhikkhus, there are these five factors that assist striving. What five?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is endowed with faith. He places faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.'

(2) "He is seldom ill or afflicted, possessing an even digestion that is neither too cool nor too hot but moderate and suitable for striving.

(3) "He is honest and open, one who reveals himself as he really is to the Teacher and his wise fellow monks.

(4) "He has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities.

(5) "He is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering.

"These, bhikkhus, are the five factors that assist striving."

## 54 (4) Occasions

"Bhikkhus, there are these five unfavorable occasions for striving. What five? [66]

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is old, overcome by old age. This is the first unfavorable occasion for striving.

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu is ill, overcome by illness. This is the second unfavorable occasion for striving.

(3) "Again, there is a famine, a poor harvest, a time when almsfood is difficult to obtain and it is not easy to subsist by means of gleaning. ${ }^{1046}$ This is the third unfavorable occasion for striving.
(4) "Again, there is peril, turbulence in the wilderness, and the people of the countryside, mounted on their vehicles, flee on all sides. This is the fourth unfavorable occasion for striving.

(5) "Again, there is a schism in the Sangha, and when there is a schism in the Sangha there are mutual insults, mutual reviling, mutual disparagement, and mutual rejection. ${ }^{1047}$ Then those without confidence do not gain confidence, while some of those with confidence change their minds. This is the fifth unfavorable occasion for striving.

"These are the five unfavorable occasions for striving.

"There are, bhikkhus, these five favorable occasions for striving. What five?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is young, a black-haired young man endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life. This is the first favorable occasion for striving.

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu is seldom ill or afflicted, possessing an even digestion that is neither too cool nor too hot but moderate and suitable for striving. This is the second favorable occasion for striving.

(3) "Again, food is plentiful; there has been a good harvest [67] and almsfood is abundant, so that one can easily sustain oneself by means of gleaning. This is the third favorable occasion for striving.

(4) "Again, people are dwelling in concord, harmoniously, without disputes, blending like milk and water, viewing each other with eyes of affection. This is the fourth favorable occasion for striving.

(5) "Again, the Sangha is dwelling at ease-in concord, harmoniously, without disputes, with a single recitation. When the Sangha is in concord, there are no mutual insults, no mutual reviling, no mutual disparagement, and no mutual rejection. Then those without confidence gain confidence and those with confidence increase [in their confidence]. ${ }^{1048}$ This is the fifth favorable occasion for striving.

"These are the five favorable occasions for striving."

# 55 (5) Mother and Son

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Now on that occasion a mother and a son, being respectively a bhikkhiunī and a bhikkhu, had entered the rains residence at Sāvatthī. They often
wanted to see one another, the mother often wanting to see her son, and the son his mother. Because they often saw one another, a bond was formed; because a bond formed, intimacy arose; because there was intimacy, lust found an opening. ${ }^{1049}$ With their minds in the grip of lust, without having given up the training and declared their weakness, they engaged in sexual intercourse. ${ }^{1050}$

Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and reported what had happened: [68] [The Blessed One said:]

"Bhikkhus, did that foolish man think: 'A mother does not fall in love with her son, or a son with his mother'? (1) Bhikkhus, I do not see even one other form that is as tantalizing, sensuous, intoxicating, captivating, infatuating; and as much of an obstacle to achieving the unsurpassed security from bondage as the form of a woman. Beings who are lustful for the form of a woman-ravenous, tied to it, infatuated, and blindly absorbed in it ${ }^{1051}$-sorrow for a long time under the control of a woman's form. (2) I do not see even one other sound... (3) ... even one other odor... (4) ... even one other taste ... (5) ... even one other touch that is as tantalizing, sensuous, intoxicating, captivating, infatuating, and as much of an obstacle to achieving the unsurpassed security from bondage as the touch of a woman. Beings who are lustful for the touch of a woman-ravenous, tied to it, infatuated, and blindly absorbed in it-sorrow for a long time under the control of a woman's touch.

"Bhikkhus, while walking, a woman obsesses the mind of a man; while standing... while sitting... while lying down... while laughing... while speaking... while singing... while crying a woman obsesses the mind of a man. When swollen, ${ }^{1052}$ too, a woman obsesses the mind of a man. Even when dead, a woman obsesses the mind of a man. If, bhikkhus, one could rightly say of anything: 'Entirely a snare of Māra,' it is precisely of women that one could say this. ${ }^{\prime 1053}$ [69]

One might talk with a murderous foe, one might talk with an evil spirit, one might even approach a viper whose bite means certain death; but with a woman, one to one, one should never talk.

They bind one whose mind is muddled with a glance and a smile, with their dress in disarray, and with gentle speech.

It is not safe to approach ${ }^{1054}$ such a person though she is swollen and dead.

These five objects of sensual pleasure are seen in a woman's body: forms, sounds, tastes, and odors, and also delightful touches.

Those swept up by the flood of sensuality, who do not fully uriderstand sense pleasures, are plunged headlong into samsāra, [into] time, destination, and existence upon existence. ${ }^{1055}$

But those who have fully understood sense pleasures live without fear from any quarter.

Having attained the destruction of the taints, while in the world, they have gone beyond.

56 (6) Preceptor

Then a certain bhikkhu approached his own preceptor and said to him: "Bhante, my body now seems as if it has been drugged, I have become disoriented, and the teachings are no longer clear to me. Dullness and drowsiness obsess my mind. I live the spiritual life dissatisfied and have doubt about the teachings."1056

Then the preceptor took his pupil to the Blessed One. He paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side, and told the Blessed One what his pupil had said. [70] [The Blessed One said:]

"So it is, bhikkhu! (1) When one is unguarded in the doors of the sense faculties, (2) immoderate in eating, (3) and not intent on wakefulness; (4) when one lacks insight into wholesome qualities (5) and does not dwell intent on the endeavor to develop the aids to enlightenment in the earlier and later phases of the night, one's body seems as if it had been drugged, one becomes disoriented, and the teachings are no longer clear to
one. Dullness and drowsiness obsess one's mind. One lives the spiritual life dissatisfied and has doubt about the teachings.

"Therefore, bhikkhu, you should train yourself thus: (1) 'I will be guarded in the doors of the sense faculties, (2) moderate in eating, (3) and intent on wakefulness; (4) I will have insight into wholesome qualities (5) and will dwell intent on the endeavor to develop the aids to enlightenment in the earlier and later phases of the night.' It is in such a way, bhikkhu, that you should train yourself."

Then, having received such an exhortation from the Blessed One, that bhikkhu rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed. Then, dwelling alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute, in no long time that bhikkhu realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having entered upon it, he dwelled in it. He directly knew: "Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being." And that bhikkhu became one of the arahants.

Then, after attaining arahantship, that bhikkhu approached his preceptor and said to him: "Bhante, my body now no longer seems as if it had been drugged, I have become well oriented, and the teachings are clear to me. Dullness and drowsiness do not obsess my mind. I live the spiritual life joyfully and have no doubt about the teachings."

Then the preceptor took his pupil to the Blessed One. [71] He paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side, and told the Blessed One what his pupil had said. [The Blessed One said:]

"So it is, bhikkhu! When one is guarded in the doors of the sense faculties, moderate in eating, and intent on wakefulness; when one has insight into wholesome qualities and dwells intent on the endeavor to develop the aids to enlightenment in the earlier and later phases of the night, one's body does not seem as if it had been drugged, one becomes well oriented, and the teachings are clear to one. Dullness and drowsiness do not obsess one's mind. One lives the spiritual life joyfully and has no doubt about the teachings.
"Therefore, bhikkhus, ${ }^{1057}$ you should train yourselves thus: (1) 'We will be guarded in the doors of the sense faculties, (2) moderate in eating, and (3) intent on wakefulness; (4) we will have insight into wholesome qualities (5) and will dwell intent on the endeavor to develop the aids to enlightenment in the earlier and later phases of the night.' It is in such a way, bhikkhus, that you should train yourselves."

# 57 (7) Themes

"Bhikkhus, there are these five themes that should often be reflected upon by a woman or a man, by a householder or one gone forth. ${ }^{1058}$ What five? (1) A woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: 'I am subject to old age; I am not exempt from old age.' (2) A woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: 'I am subject to illness; I am not exempt from illness.' (3) A woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: 'I am subject to death; I am not exempt from death.' (4) A woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect [72] thus: 'I must be parted and separated from everyone and everything dear and agreeable to me. ${ }^{1059}$ (5) A woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: 'I am the owner of my kamma, the heir of my kamma; I have kamma as my origin, kamma as my relative, kamma as my resort; I will be the heir of whatever kamma, good or bad, that I do.'

(1) "For the sake of what benefit should a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, often reflect thus: 'I am subject to old age; I am not exempt from old age'? In their youth beings are intoxicated with their youth, and when they are intoxicated with their youth they engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when one often reflects upon this theme, the intoxication with youth is either completely abandoned or diminished. It is for the sake of this benefit that a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: 'I am subject to old age; I am not exempt from old age.'

(2) "And for the sake of what benefit should a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, often reflect thus: 'I am subject to illness; I am not exempt from illness'? In a state of
health beings are intoxicated with their health, and when they are intoxicated with their health they engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when one often reflects upon this theme, the intoxication with health is either completely abandoned or diminished. It is for the sake of this benefit that a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: 'I am subject to illness; I am not exempt from illness.'

(3) "And for the sake of what benefit should a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, often reflect thus: 'I am subject to death; I am not exempt from death'? During their lives beings are intoxicated with life, and when they are intoxicated with life they engage in misconduct by body, speech, [73] and mind. But when one often reflects upon this theme, the intoxication with life is either completely abandoned or diminished. It is for the sake of this benefit that a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: 'I am subject to death; I am not exempt from death.'

(4) "And for the sake of what benefit should a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, often reflect thus: 'I must be parted and separated from everyone and everything dear and agreeable to me'? Beings have desire and lust in regard to those people and things that are dear and agreeable, and excited by this lust, they engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when one often reflects upon this theme, the desire and lust in regard to everyone and everything dear and agreeable is either completely abandoned or diminished. It is for the sake of this benefit that a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: 'I must be parted and separated from everyone and everything dear and agreeable to me.'

(5) "And for the sake of what benefit should a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, often reflect thus: 'I am the owner of my kamma, the heir of my kamma; I have kamma as my origin, kamma as my relative, kamma as my resort; I will be the heir of whatever kamma, good or bad, that I do'? People engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when one often reflects upon this theme, such misconduct is either completely abandoned or diminished. It is for the sake of this benefit that a woman or a man, a householder or one gone
forth, should often reflect thus: 'I am the owner of my kamma, the heir of my kamma; I have kamma as my origin, kamma as my relative, kamma as my resort; I will be the heir of whatever kamma, good or bad, that I do.'

(1) "This noble disciple reflects thus: [74] 'I am not the only one who is subject to old age, not exempt from old age. All beings that come and go, that pass away and undergo rebirth, are subject to old age; none are exempt from old age.' As he often reflects on this theme, the path is generated. He pursues this path, develops it, and cultivates it. As he does so, the fetters are entirely abandoned and the underlying tendencies are uprooted. ${ }^{1060}$

(2) "This noble disciple reflects thus: 'I am not the only one who is subject to illness, not exempt from illness.

He pursues this path, develops it, and cultivates it. As he does so, the fetters are entirely abandoned and the underlying tendencies are uprooted.

All beings that come and go, that pass
away and undergo rebirth, are owners of their kamma, heirs of their kamma; all have kamma as their origin, kamma as their relative, kamma as their resort; all will be heirs of whatever kamma, good or bad, that they do.'

"Worldlings subject to illness, ${ }^{1061}$

old age, and death are disgusted

[by other people] who exist

in accordance with their nature.

"If I were to become disgusted with beings who have such a nature, that would not be proper for me since I too have the same nature.

"While I was dwelling thus, having known the state without acquisitions, I overcame all intoxications intoxication with health, with youth, and with lifenaving seen security in renunciation. ${ }^{1062}$

"Zeal then arose in me as I clearly saw nibbāna.

Now I am incapable

of indulging in sensual pleasures.

Relying on the spiritual life, never will I turn back."

# 58 (8) Licchavi Youths

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Vesālī for alms: Having walked for alms in Vesālī, after the meal, when he had returned from his alms round, he entered the Great Wood and sat down at the foot of a tree to dwell for the day.

Now on that occasion a number of Licchavi youths had taken their strung bows and were walking and wandering in the Great Wood, accompanied by a pack of dogs, when they saw the Blessed One seated at the foot of a tree to dwell for the day. When they saw him, they put down their strung bows, sent the dogs off to one side, and approached him. They paid homage to the Blessed One [76] and silently stood in attendance upon him with their hands joined in reverential salutation.

Now on that occasion the Licchavi youth Mahānāma was walking and wandering for exercise in the Great Wood when he saw the Licchavi youths silently standing in attendance upon the Blessed One with their hands joined in reverential salutation. He then approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and uttered this inspired utterance: "They will be Vajjis! They will be Vajjis!"

[The Blessed One said:] "But why, Mahānāma, do you say: 'They will be Vajjis! They will be Vajjis!'?"

"These Licchavi youths, Bhante, are violent, rough, and brash. They are always plundering any sweets that are left as gifts among families, whether sugar cane, jujube fruits, cakes, pies, or sugarballs, and then they devour them. They give women and girls of respectable families blows on their backs. ${ }^{1063}$ Now they are standing silently in attendance upon the Blessed One with their hands joined in reverential salutation."

"Mahānāma, in whatever clansman five qualities are foundwhether he is a consecrated khattiya king, a country gentleman, the general of an army, a village headman, a guildmaster, or one of those who exercise private rulership over various clansonly growth is to be expected, not decline. What five?

(1) "Here, Mahānāma, with wealth acquired by energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained, a clansman honors, respects, esteems, [77] and venerates his parents. His parents, being honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, have compassion on him with a good heart, thinking: 'May you live long and maintain a long life span.' When a clansman's parents have compassion for him, only growth is to be expected for him, not decline.

(2) "Again, Mahānāma, with wealth acquired by energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the
sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained, a clansman honors, respects, esteems, and venerates his wife and children, his slaves, workers, and servants. Being honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, they have compassion on him with a good heart, thinking: 'May you live long!' When a clansman's wife and children, slaves, workers, and servants have compassion for him, only growth is to be expected for him, not decline.

(3) "Again, Mahānāma, with wealth acquired by energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained, a clansman honors, respects, esteems, and venerates the owners of the neighboring fields and those with whom he does business. ${ }^{1064}$ Being honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, they have compassion on him with a good heart, thinking: 'May you live long!' When the owners of the neighboring fields and those with whom he does business have compassion for a clansman, only growth is to be expected for him, not decline.

(4) "Again, Mahānāma, with wealth acquired by energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the. sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained, a clansman honors, respects, esteems, and venerates the oblational deities. ${ }^{1065}$ Being honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, they have compassion on him with a good heart, thinking: 'May you live long!' When the oblational deities have compassion for a clansman, only growth is to be expected for him, not decline.

(5) "Again, Mahānāma, with wealth acquired by energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteously gained, a clansman honors, respects, esteems, and venerates ascetics and brahmins. Being honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, they have compassion on him with a good heart, thinking: 'May you live long!' When ascetics and brahmins have compassion [78] for a clansman, only growth is to be expected for him, not decline.

"Mahānāma, in whatever clansman these five qualities are found-whether he is a consecrated khattiya king, a country gentleman, the general of an army, a village headman, a guildmaster, or one of those who exercise private rulership over various clans-only growth is to be expected, not decline."

He always does his duty toward his parents;

he promotes the welfare of his wife and children.

He takes care of the people in his home and those who live in dependence on him.

The wise person, charitable and virtuous, acts for the good of both kinds of relatives, those who have passed away and those still living in this world.

[He benefits] ascetics and brahmins, and [also] the deities;

he is one who gives rise to joy while living a righteous life at home.

Having done what is good, he is worthy of veneration and praise.

They praise him here in this world and after death he rejoices in heaven.

67 (7) Bases for Psychic Potency (1)

"Bhikkhus, when any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī develops and cultivates five things, one of two fruits is to be expected: [82] either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue remaining, the state of non-returning. What five?

(3) He develops the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to mind and activities of striving.

68 (8) Bases for Psychic Potency (2)

"Bhikkhus, before my enlightenment, while I was just a bodhisatta, not yet fully enlightened, I developed and cultivated five things. What five?

(3) I developed the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to mind and activities of striving. (4) I developed the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to investigation and activities of striving. (5) Enthusiasm itself was the fifth.

"Because I had developed and cultivated these things with enthusiasm as the fifth, there being a suitable basis, I was capable of realizing any state realizable by direct knowledge toward which I inclined my mind.

"If I wished: 'May I wield the various kinds of psychic potency:
having been one, may I become many ... [as in 5:23]... may I exercise mastery with the body as far as the brahmā world,' I was capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis... [as in 5:23]...

"If I wished: [83] 'May I, with the destruction of the taints, in this very life realize for myself with direct knowledge the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, may I dwell in it,' I was capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis."

# III. Future Perils

71 (1) Liberation of Mind (1)

"Bhikkhus, these five things, when developed and cultivated, have liberation of mind as their fruit, liberation of mind as their fruit and benefit; they have liberation by wisdom as their fruit, liberation by wisdom as their fruit and benefit. ${ }^{1071}$ What five?

Here, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the unattractiveness of the body, perceiving the repulsiveness of food, perceiving nondelight in the entire world, contemplating impermanence in all conditioned phenomena; and he has the perception of death well established internally. These five things, when developed and cultivated, have liberation of mind as their fruit, liberation of mind as their fruit and benefit; they have liberation by wisdom as their fruit, liberation by wisdom as their fruit and benefit.

"When a bhikkhu is liberated in mind and liberated by wisdom, he is called a bhikkhu who has removed the crossbar, filled in the moat, pulled out the pillar, a boltless one, a noble one with banner lowered, with burden dropped, detached. ${ }^{1072}$

"And how has a bhikkhu removed the crossbar? Here, a bhikkhu has abandoned ignorance, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has removed the crossbar.

"And how has a bhikkhu filled in the moat? Here, a bhikkhu has abandoned the wandering on in birth that brings renewed existence; he has cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has filled in the moat.

"And how has a bhikkhú pulled out the pillar? [85] Here, a bhikkhu has abandoned craving, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has pulled out the pillar.

"And how is a bhikkhu a boltless one? Here, a bhikkhu has abandoned the five lower fetters, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so that they are no more subject to future arising. It is in this way that a bhikkhu is a boltless one.

"And how is a bhikkhú a noble one with banner lowered, with burden dropped, detached? Here, a bhikkhu has abandoned the conceit 'I am,' cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising. It is in this way that a bhikkhu is a noble one with banner lowered, with burden dropped, detached."

72 (2) Liberation of Mind (2)

"Bhikkhus, these five things, when developed and cultivated, have liberation of mind as their fruit, liberation of mind as their fruit and benefit; they have liberation by wisdom as their fruit, liberation by wisdom as their fruit and benefit.

"When a bhikkhu is liberated in mind and liberated by wisdom, he is called a bhikkhu who has removed the crossbar, filled in the moat, pulled out the pillar, a boltless one, a noble one with bänner lowered, with burden dropped, detached.

"And how is a bhikkhu one who has removed the crossbar? ... [all as in 5:71, down:] [86]... It is in this way that a bhikkhu is a noble one with banner lowered, with burden dropped, detached."

# 73 (3) One Who Dovells in the Dhamma (1)

Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:

"It is said, Bhante, 'one who dwells in the Dhamma, one who dwells in the Dhamma. ${ }^{1074}$ In what way is a bhikkhu one who dwells in the Dhamma?"

(1) "Here, bhikkhu, a bhikkhu learns the Dhamma: the discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts, and questions-and-answers. He passes the day in learning the Dhamma but neglects seclusion and does not devote himself to internal serenity of mind. This is called a bhikkhu who is absorbed in learning, not one who dwells in the Dhamma. [87]

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu teaches the Dhamma to others in detail as he has heard and learned it. He passes the day communicating the Dhamma ${ }^{1075}$ but neglects seclusion and does not devote himself to internal serenity of mind. This is called a bhikkhu who is absorbed in communication, not one who dwells in the Dhamma.

(3) "Again, a bhikkhu recites the Dhámma in detail as he
has heard it and learned it. He passes the day in recitation but neglects seclusion and does not devote himself to internal serenity of mind. This is called a bhikkhu who is absorbed in recitation, not one who dwells in the Dhamma.

(4) "Again, a bhikkhu ponders, examines, and mentally inspects the Dhamma as he has heard it and learned it. He passes the day in thinking about the Dhamma but neglects seclusion and does not devote himself to internal serenity of mind. This is called a bhikkhu who is absorbed in thought, not one who dwells in the Dhamma.

(5) "Here, a bhikkhu learns the Dhamma-the discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts, and questions-and-answers-but he does not pass the day [solely] in learning the Dhamma. He does not neglect seclusion but devotes himself to internal serenity of mind. ${ }^{1076}$ It is in this way that a bhikkhu is one who dwells in the Dhamma.

"Thus, bhikkhu, I have taught the one absorbed in learning, the one absorbed in communication, the one absorbed in recitation, the one absorbed in thought, and the one who dwells in the Dhamma. Whatever should be done by a compassionate teacher out of compassion for his disciples, seeking their welfare, that I have done for you. These are the feet of trees, these are empty huts. Meditate, bhikkhu, do not be heedless. Do not have cause to regret it later. This is our instruction to you." [88]

# 74 (4) One Who Dwells in the Dhamma (2)

Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:

"It is said, Bhante, 'one who dwells in the Dhamma, one who dwells in the Dhamma.' In what way is a bhikkhu one who dwells in the Dhamma?"

(1) "Here, bhikkhu, a bhikkhu learns the Dhamma-the discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts, and questions-and-answers-but he does not go further and understand its meaning with wisdom. ${ }^{1077}$ This is called a bhikkhu who is absorbed in learning, not one who dwells in the Dhamma.

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu teaches the Dhamma to others in detail as he has heard and learned it, but he does not go further and understand its meaning with wisdom. This is called a bhikkhu
who is absorbed in communication, not one who dwells in the Dhamma.

(3) "Again, a bhikkhu recites the Dhamma in detail as he has heard it and learned it, but he does not go further and understand its meaning with wisdom. This is called a bhikkhu who is absorbed in recitation, not one who dwells in the Dhamma.

(4) "Again, a bhikkhu ponders, examines, and mentally inspects the Dhamma as he has heard it and learned it, but he does not go further and understand its meaning with wisdom. This is called a bhikkhu who is absorbed in thought, not one who dwells in the Dhamma.

(5) "Here, a bhikkhu learns the Dhamma-the discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts, and questions-and-answers-but he goes further and understands its meaning with wisdom. It is in this way that a bhikkhu is one who dwells in the Dhamma.

"Thus, bhikkhu, I have taught the one absorbed in learning, [89] the one absorbed in communication, the one absorbed in recitation, the one absorbed in thought, and the one who dwells in the Dhamma. Whatever should be done by a compassionate teacher out of compassion for his disciples, seeking their welfare, that I have done for you. These are the feet of trees, these are empty huts. Meditate, bhikkhu, do not be heedless. Do not have cause to regret it later. This is our instruction to you."

# 75 (5) Warriors (1)

"Bhikkhus, there are these five kinds of warriors found in the world. What five?

(1) "Here, some warrior, when he sees the cloud of dust, ${ }^{1078}$ sinks, founders, does not brace himself, and cannot enter the battle. There is, bhikkhus, such a warrior here. This is the first kind of warrior found in the world.

(2) "Again, some warrior can endure the cloud of dust, but when he sees the crests of the standards, he sinks, founders, does not brace himself, and cannot enter the battle. There is, bhikkhus, such a warrior here. This is the second kind of warrior found in the world.

(3) "Again, some warrior can endure the cloud of dust and the crests of the standards, but when he hears the uproar, he
sinks, founders, does not brace himself, and cannot enter the battle. There is, bhikkhus, such a warrior here. This is the third kind of warrior found in the world.

(4) "Again, some warrior can endure the cloud of dust, the crests of the standards, and the uproar, but he is struck down and wounded by blows. There is, bhikkhus, such a warrior here. This is the fourth kind of warrior found in the world.

(5) "Again, some warrior can endure the cloud of dust, the crests of the standards, the uproar, [90] and the blows. Having triumphed in that battle, he emerges victorious and settles at the head of the battlefield. There is, bhikkhus, such a warrior here. This is the fifth kind of warrior found in the world.

"These are the five kinds of warriors found in the world.

"So too, there are these five kinds of persons similar to warriors found among the bhikkhus. What five?

(1) "Here, some bhikkhu, when he sees the cloud of dust, sinks, founders, does not brace himself, and cannot maintain the spiritual life. He discloses his weakness in the training, gives up the training, and reverts to the lower life. ${ }^{1079}$ What is the cloud of dust in his case? The bhikkhu hears: 'In such and such a village or town the women or girls are beautiful, attractive, graceful, possessing supreme beauty of complexion.' Having heard this, he sinks, founders, does not brace himself, and cannot maintain the spiritual life. He discloses his weakness in the training, gives up the training, and reverts to the lower life. This is the cloud of dust in his case. I say that this person is just like the warrior who, when he sees the cloud of dust, sinks, founders, does not brace himself, and cannot enter the battle. There is, bhikkhus, such a person here. This is the first kind of person similar to a warrior found among the bhikkhus.

(2) "Again, some bhikkhu can endure the cloud of dust, but when he sees the crests of the standards, he sinks, founders, does not brace himself, and cannot maintain the spiritual life. He discloses his weakness in the training, gives up the training, and reverts to the lower life. What are the crests of the standards in his case? The bhikkhu does not hear: 'In such and such a village or town the women or girls are beautiful, attractive, graceful, possessing supreme beauty of complexion,' but he himself sees a woman or a girl who is beautiful, attractive, graceful, possessing supreme beauty of complexion. Having
seen her, he sinks, founders, does not brace himself, and [91] cannot maintain the spiritual life. He discloses his weakness in the training, gives up the training, and reverts to the lower life. These are the crests of the standards in his case. I say that this person is just like the warrior who can endure the cloud of dust, but when he sees the crests of the standards, he sinks, founders, does not brace himself, and cannot enter the battle. There is, bhikkhus, such a person here. This is the second kind of person similar to a warrior found among the bhikkhus.

(3) "Again, some bhikkhu can endure the cloud of dust and the crests of the standards, but when he hears the uproar, he sinks, founders, does not brace himself, and cannot maintain the spiritual life. He discloses his weakness in the training, gives up the training, and reverts to the lower life. What is the uproar in his case? When the bhikkhu has gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, a woman approaches him, smiles at him, chats with him, laughs at him, and teases him. As the woman is smiling at him, chatting with him, laughing at him, and teasing him, he sinks, founders, does not brace himself, and cannot maintain the spiritual life. He discloses his weakness in the training, gives up the training, and reverts to the lower life. This is the uproar in his case. I say that this person is just like the warrior who can endure the cloud of dust and the crests of the standards, but when he hears the uproar, he sinks, founders, does not brace himself, and cannot enter the battle. There is, bhikkhus, such a person here. This is the third kind of person similar to a warrior found among the bhikkhus.

(4) "Again, some bhikkhu can endure the cloud of dust, the crests of the standards, and the uproar, but he is struck down and wounded by a blow. What is the blow in his case? When the bhikkhu has gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, [92] or to an empty hut, a woman approaches him, sits down or lies down next to him, and embraces him. When she does so, he has sexual intercourse with her without having given up the training and disclosed his weakness. This is the blow in his case. I say that this person is just like the warrior who can endure the cloud of dust, the crests of the standards, and the uproar, but who is struck down and wounded by a blow. There is, bhikkhus, such a person here. This is the fourth kind of person similar to a warrior found among the bhikkhus.
(5) "Again, some bhikkhu can endure the clouds of dust, the crests of the standards, the uproar, and a blow. Having triumphed in that battle, he emerges victorious and settles at the head of the battlefield. What is the victory in his case? When the bhikkhu has gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, a woman approaches him, sits down or lies down next to him, and embraces him. But he disentangles himself, frees himself, and goes off wherever he wants.

"He resorts to a secluded lodging: the forest, the foot of a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a jungle highland, the open air, a heap of straw. Gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, he sits down, folding his legs crosswise, straightening his body, and establishing mindfulness in front of him. Having abandoned longing for the world, he dwells with a mind free from longing; he purifies his mind from longing. Having abandoned ill will and hatred, he dwells with a mind free from ill will, compassionate toward all living beings; he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred. Having abandoned dullness and drowsiness, he dwells free from dullness and drowsiness, percipient of light, mindful and clearly comprehending; he purifies his mind from dullness and drowsiness. Having abandoned restlessness and remorse, he dwells without agitation, with a mind inwardly peaceful; he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorse. Having abandoned doubt, he dwells having gone beyond doubt, [93] unperplexed about wholesome qualities; he purifies his mind from doubt.

"Having abandoned these five hindrances, defilements of the mind that weaken wisdom, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna . . . the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity.

"When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, cleansed, unblemished, rid of defilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs it to the knowledge of the destruction of the taints. ${ }^{1080} \mathrm{He}$ understands as it really is: 'This is suffering.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the origin of suffering.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the cessation of suffering.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' He understands
as it really is: 'These are the taints.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the origin of the taints.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the cessation of the taints.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the way leading to the cessation of the taints.' When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire, from the taint of existence, and from the taint of ignorance. When it is liberated, there comes the knowledge: '[It's] liberated.' He understands: 'Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.' This is his victory in battle.

"Bhikkhus, I say that this person is like the warrior who can endure the cloud of dust, the crests of the standards, the uproar, and the blow, and who, having triumphed in that battle, emerges victorious and settles at the head of the battlefield. There is, bhikkhus, such a person here. This is the fifth kind of person similar to a warrior found among the bhikkhus.

"These are the five kinds of persons similar to warriors found among the bhikkhus."

# 76 (6) Warriors (2)

"Bhikkhus, there are these five kinds of warriors found in the world. What five?

(1) "Here, some warrior takes up a sword and shield, [94] arms himself with a bow and quiver, and enters the fray of battle. He strives and exerts himself in the battle, but his foes slay him and finish him off. There is, bhikkhus, such a warrior here. This is the first kind of warrior found in the world.

(2) "Again, some warrior takes up a sword and shield, arms himself with a bow and quiver, and enters the fray of battle. He strives and exerts himself in the battle, but his foes wound him. [His comrades] carry him off and bring him to his relatives. While he is being brought to his relatives, he dies along the way even before he arrives. There is, bhikkhus, such a warrior here. This is the second kind of warrior found in the world.

(3) "Again, some warrior takes up a sword and shield, arms himself with a bow and quiver, and enters the fray of battle. He strives and exerts himself in the battle, but his foes wound him. [His comrades] carry him off and bring him to his relatives. His relatives nurse him and look after him, but while they are doing
so he dies from that injury. There is, bhikkhus, such a warrior here. This is the third kind of warrior found in the world.

(4) "Again, some warrior takes up a sword and shield, arms himself with a bow and quiver, and enters the fray of battle. He strives and exerts himself in the battle, but his foes wound him. [His comrades] carry him off and bring him to his relatives. His relatives nurse him and look after him, and as a result he recovers from that injury. There is, bhikkhus, such a warrior here. This is the fourth kind of warrior found in the world.

(5) "Again, some warrior takes up a sword and shield, arms himself with a bow and quiver, and enters the fray of battle. Having triumphed in that battle, he emerges victorious [95] and settles at the head of the battlefield. There is, bhikkhus, such a warrior here. This is the fifth kind of warrior found in the world.

"These are the five kinds of warriors found in the world.

"So too, there are these five kinds of persons similar to warriors found among the bhikkhus. What five?

(1) "Here, some bhikkhu dwells in dependence upon a certain village or town. In the morning, he dresses, takes his robe and bowl, and enters that village or town for alms, with body, speech, and mind unguarded, without having established mindfulness, his sense faculties unrestrained. There he sees women with their dress in disarray and loosely attired. When he sees them, lust invades his mind. With his mind invaded by lust, he has sexual intercourse without having disclosed his weakness and given up the training. This person, I say, is just like the warrior who takes up a sword and shield, arms himself with a bow and quiver, and enters the fray of battle, and whose foes slay him and finish him off while he is striving and exerting himself in battle. There is, bhikkhus, such a person here. This is the first kind of person similar to a warrior found among the bhikkhus.

(2) "Again, some bhikkhu dwells in dependence upon a certain village or town. In the morning, he dresses, takes his robe and bowl, and enters that village or town for alms ... [and] lust invades his mind. With his mind invaded by lust, he burns bodily and mentally [with the fever of lust]. He thinks: 'Let me return to the monastery [96] and inform the bhikkhus: "Friends, I am obsessed by lust, oppressed by lust. I cannot maintain the
spiritual life. Having disclosed my weakness in the training, I will give up the training and revert to the lower life." While he is returning to the monastery, even before he arrives, he discloses his weakness in the training, gives up the training, and reverts to the lower life along the way. This person, I say, is just like the warrior who takes up a sword and shield, arms himself with a bow and quiver, enters the fray of battle, is wounded by his foes while he strives and exerts himself in the battle, and is then carried off and brought to his relatives but dies along the way even before he arrives. There is, bhikkhus, such a person here. This is the second kind of person similar to a warrior found among the bhikkhus.

He returns to the monastery and informs the bhikkhus: 'Friends, I am obsessed by lust, oppressed by lust. I cannot maintain the spiritual life. Having disclosed my weakness in the training, I will give up the training and revert to the lower life.' His fellow monks then exhort and instruct him: [97] 'Friend, the Blessed One has stated that sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering and anguish, and that the danger in them is more. ${ }^{1081}$ With the simile of the skeleton the Blessed One has stated that sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering and anguish, and that the danger in them is more. With the simile of the piece of meat..., with the simile of the grass torch... with the simile of the charcoal pit... with the simile of the dream... with the simile of the borrowed goods... with the simile of fruits on a tree . . . with the simile of the butcher's knife and block . . . with the simile of the sword stake . . . with the simile of the snake's head, the Blessed One has stated that sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering and anguish, and that the danger in them is more. Enjoy the spiritual life. Do not think you are unable to follow the training, give it
up, and revert to the lower life.' While he is being exhorted and instructed by his fellow monks in this way, he protests: 'Friends, although the Blessed One has stated that sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering and anguish, and that the danger in them is more, still, I am unable to maintain the spiritual life. Having disclosed my weakness in the training, I will give up the training and revert to the lower life.' Having disclosed his weakness in the training, he gives up the training and reverts to the lower life. This person, I say, is just like the warrior who takes up a sword and shield, arms himself with a bow and quiver, enters the fray of battle, is wounded by his foes while he strives and exerts himself in the battle, and is then carried off [98] and brought to his relatives, who nurse him and look after him, but who dies from that injury.

There is, bhikkhus, such a person here. This is the fourth kind of person similar to a warrior found among the bhikkhus.

(5) "Again, some bhikkhu dwells in dependence upon a certain village or town. In the morning, he dresses, takes his robe and bowl, and enters that village or town for alms with body, speech, and mind guarded, mindfulness established, and sense faculties restrained. Having seen a form with the eye, he does not grasp its marks and features. Since, if he left the eye faculty unrestrained, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him, he practices restraint over it; he guards the eye faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. Having heard a sound with the ear . . . Having smelled an odor with the nose... Having tasted a taste with the tongue ... [100]... Having felt a tactile object with the body ... Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, he does not grasp its marks and features. Since, if he left the mind faculty unrestrained, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him, he practices restraint over it; he guards the mind faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty. After his meal, on returning from his alms round, he resorts to a secluded lodging: the forest, the foot of a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a jungle highland, the open air, a heap of straw. Gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, he sits down, folding his legs crosswise, straightening his body, and establishing mindfulness in front of him. Having abandoned longing for the world ... [as in 5:75]... he purifies his mind from doubt.

"Having abandoned these five hindrances, defilements of the mind that weaken wisdom, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna... the second jhāna... the third jhāna... the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity.
"When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, cleansed, unblemished, rid of defilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs it to the knowledge of the destruction of the taints.

# 77 (7) Future Perils (1)

"Bhikkhus, when a forest bhikkhu considers five future perils, it is enough for him to dwell heedful, ardent, [101] and resolute for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yetunrealized. What five?

(1) "Here, a forest bhikkhu reflects thus: 'I am now dwelling all alone in the forest. But while I am living here, a snake might bite me, a scorpion might sting me, or a centipede might sting me. Because of that I might die, which would be an obstacle for me. Let me now arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yetunattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.' This is the first future peril considering which it is enough for a forest bhikkhu to dwell heedful, ardent, and resolute ... for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.

(2) "Again, a forest bhikkhu reflects thus: 'I am now dwelling all alone in the forest. But while I am living here, I might trip and fall down, or the food that I have eaten might harm me, or my bile or phlegm or sharp winds might become agitated in me. Because of that I might die, which would be an obstacle for me.

future peril considering which it is enough for a forest bhikkhu to dwell heedful, ardent, and resolute ... for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.

(3) "Again, a forest bhikkhu reflects thus: 'I am now dwelling all alone in the forest. But while I am living here, I might encounter wild beasts, such as a lion, a tiger, a leopard, a bear, or a hyena, and they might take my life. Because of that I would die, [102] which would be an obstacle for me. Let me now arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.'

But while I am living here, I might encounter hoodlums escaping a crime or planning one and they might take my life. Because of that I would die, which would be an obstacle for me. Let me now arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yetunachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.'

"Bhikkhus, when a forest bhikkhu considers five future perils, it is enough for him to dwell heedful, ardent, and resolute for the
attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. What five?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'I am now young, a blackhaired young man endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life. But there will come a time when old age assails this body. Now when one is old, overcome by old age, it is not easy to attend to the Buddhas' teaching; it is not easy to resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves. Before that unwished for, undesirable, disagreeable condition comes upon me, let me in advance arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. Thus when I am in that condition, I will dwell at ease even though I am old.' This is the first future peril considering which it is enough for a bhikkhu to dwell heedful, ardent, and resolute . . . for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'I am now seldom ill or afflicted; I possess an even digestion that is neither too cool nor too hot but moderate and suitable for striving. But there will come a time when illness assails this body. Now when one is ill, overcome by illness, it is not easy to attend to the Buddhas' teaching; it is not easy to resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves. Before that unwished for, undesirable, disagreeable condition comes upon me, let me in advance arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. [104] Thus when I am in that condition, I will dwell at ease even though I am ill.' This is the second future peril considering which it is enough for a bhikkhu to dwell heedful, ardent, and resolute . . . for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.

(3) "Again, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'Food is now plentiful; there has been a good harvest and almsfood is abundant, so that one can easily subsist by means of gleaning. But there will come a time of famine, a poor harvest, when almsfood is hard to obtain and one cannot easily subsist by means of gleaning. In a time of famine, people migrate to places where food is plentiful and living conditions there are congested and crowded. Now when living conditions are congested and crowded, it is not easy to attend to the Buddhas' teaching; it is not easy to resort
to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves. Before that unwished for, undesirable, disagreeable condition comes upon me, let me in advance arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. Thus when I am in that condition, I will dwell at ease even in a famine.' This is the third future peril considering which it is enough for a bhikkhu to dwell heedful, ardent, and resolute ... for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.

(4) "Again, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'People are now dwelling. in concord, harmoniously, without disputes, blending like milk and water, viewing each other with eyes of affection. But there will come a time of peril, of turbulence in the wilderness, when the people of the countryside, mounted on their vehicles, flee on all sides. In a time of peril, people migrate to places where there is safety and living conditions there are congested and crowded. [105] Now when living conditions are congested and crowded, it is not easy to attend to the Buddhas' teaching; it is not easy to resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves. Before that unwished for, undesirable, disagreeable condition comes upon me, let me in advance arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yetunachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. Thus when I am in that condition, I will dwell at ease even in time of peril.' This is the fourth future peril considering which it is enough for a bhikkhu to dwell heedful, ardent, and resolute ... for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.

(5) "Again, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'The Sangha is now dwelling at ease-in concord, harmoniously, without disputes, with a single recitation. But there will come a time when there will be a schism in the Sangha. Now when there is a schism in the Sangha, it is not easy to attend to the Buddhas' teaching; it is not easy to resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves. Before that unwished for, undesirable, disagreeable condition comes upon me, let me in advance arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yetunrealized. Thus when I am in that condition, I will dwell at ease even though there is a schism in the Sangha.' This is the fifth future peril considering which it is enough for a bhikkhu

# 79 (9) Future Perils (3)

"Bhikkhus, there are these five future perils as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You should recognize them [106] and make an effort to abandon them. What five?

These [pupils] too will be undeveloped in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom. They in turn will give full ordination to others but will not be able to discipline them in the higher virtuous behavior, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom. These [pupils] too will be undeveloped in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom.

Then the young deva Kakudha approached the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and [123] said to him: "Bhante, such a desire arose in Devadatta: 'I will take charge of the Sangha of bhikkhus.' And together with the arising of this thought, Devadatta lost that psychic
potency." ${ }^{1105}$ This is what the young deva Kakudha said. He then paid homage to the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and disappeared right there.

[The Blessed One said:] "But, Moggallāna, have you encompassed his mind with your mind and understood of the young deva Kakudha: 'Whatever the young deva Kakudha says is all true and not otherwise'?"

"Yes, Bhanite."

(2) Whatever timidity there is in one who is immoral does not exist in one who is virtuous; therefore this quality makes for self-confidence in a trainee.

# 104 (4) Delicate ${ }^{1116}$

"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a bhikkhu is a delicate ascetic among ascetics. What five?

They usually present him what is agreeable, seldom what is disagreeable. (3) Discomfort originating from bile, phlegm, wind, or their combination; discomfort produced by change of climate; discomfort produced by careless behavior; discomfort produced by assault; or discomfort produced as the result of kamma-these do not often arise in him. He is seldom ill. (4) He gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life.

It is by possessing these five qualities that a bhikkhu is a delicate ascetic among ascetics.

"If, bhikkhus, one could rightly say of anyone: 'He is a
delicate ascetic among ascetics,' it is precisely of me that one might say this. (1) For I usually use a robe that has been specifically offered to me, seldom one that has not been specifically offered to me; I usually eat almsfood that has been specifically offered to me, seldom almsfood that has not been specifically offered to me; I usually use a lodging that has been specifically offered to me, seldom one that has not been specifically offered to me; I usually use medicines and provisions for the sick that have been specifically offered to me, seldom those that have not been specifically offered to me. (2) Those bhikkhus with whom I dwell usually behave toward me in agreeable ways by body, speech, and mind, seldom in disagreeable ways. They usually present me what is agreeable, seldom what is disagreeable. (3) Discomfort originating from bile, phlegm, wind, or their combination; discomfort produced by change of climate; discomfort produced by careless behavior; discomfort produced by assault; or discomfort produced as the result of kamma-these [132] do not often arise in me. I am seldom ill. (4) I gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life. (5) With the destruction of the taints, I have realized for myself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, I dwell in it. If, bhikkhus, one could rightly say of anyone: 'He is a delicate ascetic among ascetics,' it is precisely of me that one might say this."

"When, Ānanda, [133] a bhikkhu is himself accomplished in virtuous behavior but does not exhort others in regard to virtuous behavior, ${ }^{1118}$ to this extent he can dwell at ease while living in the Sangha."

(2) "But, Bhante, might there be another way by which a bhikkhu can dwell at ease while living in the Sangha?"

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood.

What five? The elephant-gem, the horse-gem, the jewel-gem, the woman-gem, and the stewardgem. The manifestation of these five gems is rare in the world." [168]

Then the Licchavis stationed a man on the road and told him: "Good man, when you see the Blessed One coming, you should inform us." The man saw the Blessed One coming in the distance, went to the Licchavis, and told them: "Sirs, this Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One is coming. You may go at your own convenience."

Then the Licchavis approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. Standing there, they said to him: "Please, Bhante, let the Blessed One go to the Sārandada Shrine out of compassion." The Blessed One silently consented. He went to the Sārandada Shrine, sat down on a seat that was prepared, and said to the Licchavis:

"What discussion were you engaged in just now as you were sitting together here? What was the conversation that was underway?"

"Here, Bhante, when we had assembled and were sitting together, this conversation arose ... [He here repeats the entire conversation above.] ...'The manifestation of these five gems is rare in the world."

"Intent on sensual pleasures, the Licchavis were engaged in a conversation about sensual pleasures! Licchavis, the manifestation of five gems is rare in the world. What five?

# 157.(7) Wrongly Addressed Talk

A talk on faith is wrongly addressed to one devoid of faith; a talk on virtuous behavior is wrongly addressed to an immoral person; a talk on learning is wrongly addressed to one of little learning; a talk on generosity is wrongly addressed to a miser; a talk on wisdom is wrongly addressed to an unwise person.

(1) "And why, bhikkhus, is a talk on faith wrongly addressed to one devoid of faith?

Now on that occasion the Venerable Udāyī, surrounded by a large assembly of laypeople, was sitting teaching the Dhamma. ${ }^{1154}$ The Venerable Ananda saw this and approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: "Bhante, the Venerable Udāyī, surrounded by a large assembly of laypeople, is teaching the Dhamma."

"It isn't easy, Ānanda, to teach the Dhamma to others. One who teaches the Dhamma to others should first set up five qualities internally. What five?

## II. RESENTMENT

161 (1) Removing Resentment (1)

"Bhikkhus, there are these five ways of removing resentment by which a bhikkhu should entirely remove resentment when it has arisen toward anyone. ${ }^{1157}$ What five? (1) One should develop
loving-kindness for the person one resents; in this way one should remove the resentment toward that person. (2) One should develop compassion for the person one resents; in this way one should remove the resentment toward that person. (3) One should develop equanimity toward the person one resents; in this way one should remove the resentment toward that person. [186] (4) One should disregard the person one resents and pay no attention to him; in this way one should remove the resentment toward that person. (5) One should apply the idea of the ownership of kamma to the person one resents, thus: 'This venerable one is the owner of his kamma, the heir of his kamma; he has kamma as his origin, kamma as his relative, kamma as his resort; he will be the heir of any kamma he does, good or bad.' In this way one should remove the resentment toward that person. These are the five ways of removing resentment by which a bhikkhu should entirely remove resentment when it has arisen toward anyone."

# 162 (2) Removing Resentment (2)

There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend," those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:

"Friends, there are these five ways of removing resentment by which a bhikkhu should entirely remove resentment when it has arisen toward anyone. What five? (1) Here, a person's bodily behavior is impure, but his verbal behavior is pure; one should remove resentment toward such a person. (2) A person's verbal behavior is impure, but his bodily behavior is pure; one should also remove resentment toward such a person. (3) A person's bodily behavior and verbal behavior are impure, but from time to time he gains an opening of the mind, placidity of mind; ${ }^{1158}$ one should also remove resentment toward such a person. (4) A person's bodily behavior and verbal behavior are impure, and he does not gain [187] an opening of the mind, placidity of mind from time to time; one should also remove resentment toward such a person. (5) A person's bodily behavior and verbal behavior are pure, and from time to time he gains an opening of the mind, placidity of mind; one should also remove resentment toward such a person.
(1) "How, friends, should resentment be removed toward the person whose bodily behavior is impure but whose verbal behavior is pure? Suppose a rag-robed bhikkhu sees a rag by the roadside. He would press it down with his left foot, spread it out with his right foot, tear off an intact section, and take it away with him; so too, when a person's bodily behavior is impure but his verbal behavior is pure, on that occasion one should not attend to the impurity of his bodily behavior but should instead attend to the purity of his verbal behavior. In this way resentment toward that person should be removed.

(2) "How, friends, should resentment be removed toward the person whose verbal behavior is impure but whose bodily behavior is pure? Suppose there is a pond covered with algae and water plants. A man might arrive, afflicted and oppressed by the heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. He would plunge into the pond, sweep away the algae and water plants with his hands, drink from his cupped hands, and then leave; so too, [188] when a person's verbal behavior is impure but his bodily behavior is pure, on that occasion one should not attend to the impurity of his verbal behavior but should instead attend to the purity of his bodily behavior. In this way resentment toward that person should be removed.

(3) "How, friends, should resentment be removed toward the person whose bodily behavior and verbal behavior are impure but who from time to time gains an opening of the mind, placidity of mind? Suppose there is a little water in a puddle. Then a person might arrive, afflicted and oppressed by the heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. He would think: 'This little bit of water is in the puddle. If I try to drink it with my cupped hands or a vessel, I will stir it up, disturb it, and make it undrinkable. Let me get down on all fours, suck it up like a cow, and depart.' He then gets down on all fours, sucks the water up like a cow, and departs. So too, when a person's bodily behavior and verbal behavior are impure but from time to time he gains an opening of the mind, placidity of mind, on that occasion one should not attend to the impurity of his bodily and verbal behavior, but should instead attend [189] to the opening of the mind, the placidity of mind, he gains from time to time. In this way resentment toward that person should be removed.

(4) "How, friends, should resentment be removed toward the
person whose bodily and verbal behavior are impure and who does not gain an opening of the mind, placidity of mind, from time to time? Suppose a sick, afflicted, gravely ill person was traveling along a highway, and the last village behind him and the next village ahead of him were both far away. He would not obtain suitable food and medicine or a qualified attendant; he would not get [to meet] the leader of the village district. Another man traveling along the highway might see him and arouse sheer compassion, sympathy, and tender concern for him, thinking: 'Oh, may this man obtain suitable food, suitable medicine, and a qualified attendant! May he get [to meet] the leader of the village district! For what reason? So that this man does not encounter calamity and disaster right here.' So too, when a person's bodily and verbal behavior are impure and he does not gain from time to time an opening of the mind, placidity of mind, on that occasion one should arouse sheer compassion, sympathy, and tender concern for him, thinking, 'Oh, may this venerable one abandon bodily misbehavior and develop good bodily behavior; may he abandon verbal misbehavior and develop good verbal behavior; may he abandon mental misbehavior and develop good mental behavior! For what reason? So that, with the breakup of the body, after death, he will not be reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.' In this way resentment toward that person should be removed. [190]

(5) "How, friends, should resentment be removed toward the person whose bodily and verbal behavior are pure and who from time to time gains an opening of the mind, placidity of mind? Suppose there were a pond with clear, sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, a delightful place shaded by various trees. Then a man might arrive, afflicted and oppressed by the heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. Having plunged into the pond, he would bathe and drink, and then, after coming out, he would sit or lie down in the shade of a tree right there. So too, when a person's bodily and verbal behavior are pure and from time to time he gains an opening of the mind, placidity of mind, on that occasion one should attend to his pure bodily behavior, to his pure verbal behavior; and to the opening of the mind, the placidity of mind, that he gains from time to time. In this way resentment toward that person should be removed. Friends, by
means of a person who inspires confidence in every way, the mind gains confidence. ${ }^{1159}$

"These, friends, are the five ways of removing resentment by means of which a bhikkhu can entirely remove resentment toward whomever it has arisen."

[This sutta is identical with 5:65, except that it is spoken by Sāriputta to the bhikkhus.] [191]

164 (4) Way of Life

[This sutta is identical with 5:66, except that it is spoken by Sāriputta to the bhikkhus.]

165 (5) Asking Questions

There the Venerable Sāriputta . . . said this:

"Friends, whoever asks another person a question does so for five reasons or for a particular one among them. What five? (1) One asks another person a question because of one's dullness and stupidity; (2) one with evil desires, motivated by desire, asks another person a question; [192] (3) one asks another person a question as a way of reviling [the other person]; (4) one asks another person a question because one wishes to learn; (5) or one asks another person a question with the thought: 'If, when he is asked a question by me, he answers correctly, that is good; but if he does not answer correctly, I will give him a correct explanation.' Friends, whoever asks another person a question does so for these five reasons or for a particular one among them. Friends, I ask another person a question with the thought: 'If, when he is asked a question by me, he answers correctly, that is good; but if he does not answer correctly, I will give him a correct explanation.'"

## 166 (6) Cessation

There the Venerable Sāriputta . . . said this:

"Here, friends, a bhikkhu accomplished in virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom might enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is this possibility. But if he does not reach final knowledge in this very life, having been reborn among a certain group of mind-made [deities] that
transcend the company of devas that subsist on edible food, he might [again] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. ${ }^{1160}$ There is this possibility."

When this was said, the Venerable Udāyī said to the Venerable Sāriputta: "This is impossible, friend Sāriputta, it cannot happen that a bhikkhu, having been reborn among a certain group of mind-made [deities] that transcend the company of devas that subsist on edible food, might [again] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is no such possibility."

A second time . . A third time, [193] the Venerable Sāriputta said: "Here, friends, it is possible that a bhikkhu accomplished in virtuous behavior...having been reborn among a certain group of mind-made [deities]...might [again] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is this possibility." A third time, the Venerable Udāyī said to the Venerable Sāriputta: "This is impossible, friend Sāriputta, it cannot happen that a bhikkhu, having been reborn among a certain group of mind-made [deities] . . . might [again] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is no such possibility."

Then it occurred to the Venerable Sāriputta: "The Venerable Udāyī has rejected me up to the third time, and not a single bhikkhu expresses agreement with me. Let me approach the Blessed One." Then the Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and addressed the bhikkhus: "Here, friends, a bhikkhu accomplished in virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom might [again] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is this possibility. If he does not reach final knowledge in this very life, having been reborn among a certain group of mindmade [deities] that transcend the company of devas that subsist on edible food, he might [again] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is this possibility."

When this was said, the Venerable Udāyī said to the Venerable Sāriputta: "This is impossible, friend Sāriputta, it cannot happen that a bhikkhu, having been reborn among a certain group of mind-made [deities] transcending the company of devas that subsist on edible food, might [again] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is no such possibility."

A second time... A third time, the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: "Here, friends, a bhikkhu accomplished in virtuous behavior...[194]... having been reborn among a certain group of mind-made [deities] . . . might [again] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is this possibility." A third time, the Venerable Udāyī said to the Venerable Sāriputta: "This is impossible, friend Sāriputta, it cannot happen that a bhikkhu... reborn among a certain group of mind-made [deities]... might [again] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is no such possibility."

Then it occurred to the Venerable Sāriputta: "Even when I am in the presence of the Blessed One, the Venerable Udāyī rejects me up to the third time, and not a single bhikkhu expresses agreement with me. Let me just keep silent." Then the Venerable Sāriputta fell silent.

Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Udāyī: "Udāyī, just what do you understand by a mind-made group?"

"Bhante, it is those devas that are formless, perceptionmade."1161

"What are you saying, Udāyī, you foolish and incompetent fellow? Yet you think you have to speak up!"

Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ānanda: "Ānanda, do you just look on passively as an elder bhikkhu is being harassed? Don't you have any compassion toward an elder bhikkhu when he's being harassed?"

Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu accomplished in virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom might enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. If he does not reach final knowledge in this very life, then, having been reborn among a certain group of mind-made [deities] that transcend the company of devas that subsist on edible food, he might [again] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is this possibility." This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. [195]

Then, not long after the Blessed One had left, the Venerable Ānanda approached the Venerable Upaväna and said to him: "Here, friend Upavāna, they were harassing other elder bhikkhus, but we didn't question them. ${ }^{1162}$ It would not be surprising
if this evening, when he emerges from seclusion, the Blessed One makes a pronouncement about this matter, and he might call upon the Venerable Upavāṇa himself [to give an account]. ${ }^{1163}$ Just now I feel timid."

Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and went to the meeting hall. He sat down in the appointed seat and said to the Venerable Upavāṇa:

"Upavāna, how many qualities should an elder bhikkhu possess to be pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and to be respected and esteemed by them?"

"Possessing five qualities, Bhante, an elder bhikkhu is pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and is respected and esteemed by them. What five? (1) He is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha... [as in 5:134]... he trains in them. (2) He has learned much... [as in 5:134]... he has penetrated well by view. (3) He is a good speaker with a good delivery; he is gifted with speech that is polished, clear, articulate, expressive of the meaning. (4) He gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life. (5) With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. Possessing these five qualities, an elder is pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and is respected and esteemed by them." [196]

"Good, good, Upavāṇa! Possessing those five qualities, an elder is pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and is respected and esteemed by them. But if these five qualities are not found in an elder bhikkhu, why should his fellow monks honor, respect, esteem, and venerate him? ${ }^{1164}$ On account of his broken teeth, grey hair, and wrinkled skin? But because these five qualities are found in an elder bhikkhu, his fellow monks honor, respect, esteem, and venerate him."

# 167 (7) Reproving

There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus thus: . . .

"Friends, a bhikkhu who wishes to reprove another should first establish five things in himself. What five? (1) [He should consider:] 'I will speak at a proper time, not at an improper time;
(2) I will speak truthfully, not falsely; (3) I will speak gently, not harshly; (4) I will speak in a beneficial way, not in a harmful way; (5) I will speak with a mind of loving-kindness, not while harboring hatred.' A bhikkhu who wishes to reprove another should first establish these five things in himself.

"Here, friends, I see some person being reproved at an improper time, not disturbed ${ }^{1165}$ at a proper time; being reproved about what is false, not disturbed about what is true; being reproved harshly, not disturbed gently; being reproved in a harmful way, not disturbed in a beneficial way; being reproved by one who harbors hatred, not disturbed by one with a mind of loving-kindness.

"Friends, when a bhikkhu is reproved in a way contrary to the Dhamma, non-remorse should be induced in him in five ways: (1) 'Friend, you were reproved at an improper time, not [197] at a proper time; that is sufficient for you to be without remorse. (2) You were reproved falsely, not truthfully; that is sufficient for you to be without remorse. (3) You were reproved harshly, not gently; that is sufficient for you to be without remorse. (4) You were reproved in a harmful way, not in a beneficial way; that is sufficient for you to be without remorse. (5) You were reproved by one harboring hatred, not by one with a mind of loving-kindness; that is sufficient for you to be without remorse.' When a bhikkhu is reproved in a way contrary to the Dhamma, non-remorse should be induced in him in these five ways.

"Friends, when a bhikkhui reproves in a way contrary to the Dhamma, remorse should be induced in him in five ways: (1) 'Friend, you reproved him at an improper time, not at a proper time; that is sufficient for you to feel remorse. (2) You reproved him falsely, not truthfully; that is sufficient for you to feel remorse. (3) You reproved him harshly, not gently; that is sufficient for you to feel remorse. (4) You reproved him in a harmful way, not in a beneficial way; that is sufficient for you to feel remorse. (5) You reproved him while harboring hatred, not with a mind of loving-kindness; that is sufficient for you to feel remorse.' When a bhikkhu reproves in a way contrary to the Dhamma, remorse should be induced in him in these five ways. For what reason? So that another bhikkhu would not think of reproving falsely.
"Here, friends, I see some person being reproved at a proper time, not disturbed at an improper time; being reproved truthfully, not disturbed falsely; being reproved gently, not disturbed harshly; being reproved in a beneficial way, not disturbed in a harmful way; being reproved by one with a mind of loving-kindness, not disturbed by one who harbors hatred.

"Friends, when a bhikkhu is reproved in accordance with the Dhamma, remorse should be induced in him in five ways: (1) 'Friend, you were reproved at a proper time, not at an improper time; that is sufficient for you to feel remorse. (2) You were reproved truthfully, not falsely; that is sufficient for you to feel remorse. (3) You were reproved gently, not harshly; that is sufficient for you to feel remorse. (4) You were reproved in a beneficial way, not in a harmful way; that is sufficient for you to feel remorse. (5) You were reproved by one with a mind of loving-kindness, not by one harboring hatred; that is sufficient for you to feel remorse.' [198] When a bhikkhu is reproved in accordance with the Dhamma, remorse should be induced in him in these five ways.

"Friends, when a bhikkhu reproves in accordance with the Dhamma, non-remorse should be induced in him in five ways: (1) 'Friend, you reproved him at a proper time, not at an improper time; that is sufficient for you to be without remorse. (2) You reproved him truthfully, not falsely; that is sufficient for you to be without remorse. (3) You reproved him gently, not harshly; that is sufficient for you to be without remorse. (4) You reproved him in a beneficial way, not in a harmful way; that is sufficient for you to be without remorse. (5) You reproved him with a mind of loving-kindness, not while harboring hatred; that is sufficient for you to be without remorse.' When a bhikkhu reproves in accordance with the Dhamma, non-remorse should be induced in him in these five ways. For what reason? So that another bhikkhu would think of reproving about what is true.

"Friends, a person who is reproved should be established in two things: in truth and non-anger. If others should reprove me-whether at a proper time or at an improper time; whether about what is true or about what is false; whether gently or harshly; whether in a beneficial way or in a harmful way; whether with a mind of loving-kindness or while harboring
hatred-I should still be established in two things: in truth and non-anger.

"If I know: 'There is such a quality in me,' I tell him: 'It exists. This quality is found in me.' If I know: 'There is no such quality in me,' I tell him: 'It doesn't exist. This quality isn't found in me.'

[The Blessed One said:] "Sariputta, even when you are speaking to them in such a way, some foolish men here do not respectfully accept what you say."

"There are, Bhante, persons devoid of faith who have gone forth from the household life into homelessness, not [199] out of faith but intent on earning a living; they are crafty, hypocritical, deceptive, restless, puffed up, vain, talkative, rambling in their talk, unguarded over the doors of the senses, immoderate in eating, not intent on wakefulness, indifferent to the ascetic life, not keenly respectful of the training, luxurious and lax, leaders in backsliding, discarding the duty of solitude, lazy, devoid of energy, muddle-minded, lacking in clear comprehension, unconcentrated, with wandering minds, unwise, stupid. When I speak to them in such a way, they do not respectfully accept what I say.

"But, Bhante, there are clansmen who have gone forth from the household life into homelessness out of faith, who are not crafty, hypocritical, deceptive, restless, puffed up, vain, talkative, and rambling in their talk; who keep guard over the doors of the senses; who are moderate in eating, intent on wakefulness, intent upon the ascetic life, keenly respectful of the training; who are not luxurious and lax; who discard backsliding and take the lead in solitude; who are energetic, resolute, mindful, clearly comprehending, concentrated, with one-pointed minds, wise, intelligent. When I speak to them in such a way, they respectfully accept what I say."

"Sāriputta, leave alone those people who are devoid of faith and have gone forth from the household life into homelessness, not out of faith but intent on earning a living; who are crafty . . . unwise, stupid. But, Sariputta, you should speak to those clansmen who have gone forth from the household life into homelessness out of faith, who are not crafty ... who are wise, intelligent. [200] Exhort your fellow monks, Sāriputta! Instruct your fellow monks, Sāriputta, [thinking:] 'I will cause
my fellow monks to emerge from what is contrary to the good Dhamma and will establish them in the good Dhamma.' Thus, Sāriputta, should you train yourself."

# 168 (8) Virtuous Behavior

[This sutta is identical with 5:24, except that it is spoken by Sāriputta to the bhikkhus.] [201]

## 169 (9) Of Quick Apprehension

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said: "In what way, friend Sāriputta, is a bhikkhu one of quick apprehension conceming wholesome teachings, one who grasps well what he has learned, learns abundantly, and does not forget what he has learned?"

"The Venerable Ānanda is learned, so let him clear this up himself."

"Then listen, friend Sāriputta, and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, friend," the Venerable Sāriputta replied. The Venerable Ānanda said this:

"Here, friend Sāriputta, a bhikkhu is skilled in meaning, skilled in the Dhamma, skilled in language, skilled in phrasing, and skilled in sequence. ${ }^{1166}$ In this way, friend Sāriputta, a bhikkhu is one of quick apprehension concerning wholesome teachings, one who grasps well what he has learned, learns abundantly, and does not forget what he has learned."

"It's astounding and amazing, friend, how well this has been stated by the Venerable Ānanda! We consider the Venerable Ānanda to be one who possesses these five qualities: 'The Venerable Ānanda is skilled in meaning, skilled in Dhamma, skilled in language, skilled in phrasing, and skilled in sequence.'" [202]

## 170 (10) Bhaddaji

On one occasion the Venerable Ānanda was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita's Park. Then the Venerable Bhaddaji approached the Venerable Ānanda and exchanged greetings with him. When
they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side. The Venerable Ānanda then said to him:

"Friend Bhaddaji, what is the foremost of sights? What is the foremost kind of hearing? What is the foremost happiness? What is the foremost perception? What is the foremost among states of existence?"

"(1) There is, friend, Brahmā, the vanquisher, the unvanquished, the universal seer, the wielder of power. Getting to see Brahmā is the foremost sight. (2) There are the devas of streaming radiance who are suffused and inundated with happiness. They sometimes utter the inspired utterance: 'Oh, what happiness! Oh, what happiness!' Getting to hear that sound is the foremost kind of hearing. (3) There are the devas of refulgent glory. Being happy, they experience very peaceful happiness: ${ }^{1167}$ this is the foremost happiness. (4) There are the devas of the base of nothingness: this is the foremost perception. (5) There are the devas of the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception: this is the foremost state of existence."

"Then does the Venerable Bhaddaji agree with the multitude about this?"1168

"The Venerable Ānanda is learned, so let him clear this up himself."

"Then listen, friend Bhaddaji, and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, friend," the Venerable Bhaddaji replied. The Venerable Ānanda said this:

"(1) In whatever way, friend, one sees such that immediately afterward the destruction of the taints occurs: ${ }^{1169}$ this is the foremost sight. (2) In whatever way one hears such that immediately afterward the destruction of the taints occurs: this is the foremost kind of hearing. (3) In whatever way one is happy such that immediately afterward the destruction of the taints occurs: this is the foremost happiness. (4) In whatever way one perceives such that immediately afterward the destruction of the taints occurs: this is the foremost perception. (5) In whatever way one exists such that immediately afterward the destruction of the taints occurs: this is the foremost state of existence." [203]

# III. The Lay Follower

## 171 (1) Timidity

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a lay follower is overcome by timidity. What five? He destroys life, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, speaks falsely, and indulges in liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Possessing these five qualities, a lay follower is overcome by timidity.

"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a lay follower is selfconfident. What five? He abstains from the destruction of life, abstains from taking what is not given, abstains from sexual misconduct, abstains from false speech, abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Possessing these five qualities, a lay follower is self-confident."

## 172 (2) Self-Confidence

"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a lay follower dwells without self-confidence at home. What five? [204] He destroys life, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, speaks falsely, and indulges in liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Possessing these five qualities, a lay follower dwells without self-confidence at home.

"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a lay follower dwells self-confident at home. What five? He abstains from the destruction of life, abstains from taking what is not given, abstains from sexual misconduct, abstains from false speech, abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Possessing these five qualities, a lay follower dwells self-confident at home."

## 173 (3) Hell

"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a lay follower is deposited in hell as if brought there. What five? He destroys life, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, speaks
falsely, and indulges in liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Possessing these five qualities, a lay follower is deposited in hell as if brought there.

"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a lay follower is deposited in heaven as if brought there. What five? He abstains from the destruction of life, abstains from taking what is not given, abstains from sexual misconduct, abstains from false speech, abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Possessing these five qualities, a lay follower is deposited in heaven as if brought there."

# 174 (4) Enmities

Then the householder Anāthapindika approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"Householder, without having abandoned five perils and enmities, one is called immoral and is reborn in hell. What five? The destruction of life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech, and [indulging in] liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. [205] Without having abandoned these five perils and enmities, one is called immoral and is reborn in hell.

"Householder, having abandoned five perils and enmities, one is called virtuous and is reborn in heaven. What five? The destruction of life ... and [indulging in] liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. Having abandoned these five perils and enmities, one is called virtuous and is reborn in heaven.

(1) "Householder, one who destroys life thereby engenders peril and enmity pertaining to the present life and the future life, and also experiences mental pain and dejection. One who abstains from the destruction of life does not engender peril and enmity pertaining to the present life and the future life, nor does he experience mental pain and dejection. For one who abstains from the destruction of life, that peril and enmity has thus subsided.

(2) "Householder, one who takes what is not given... (3) ... engages in sexual misconduct... (4) ... speaks falsely... (5) ... indulges in liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, thereby engenders peril and enmity pertaining to
the present life and the future life, and also experiences mental pain and dejection. One who abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, does not engender peril and enmity pertaining to the present life and the future life, nor does he experience mental pain and dejection. For one who abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, that peril and enmity has thus subsided."

There's a man in the world who destroys life, speaks falsely, and takes what is not given, who goes to the wives of others, and indulges in liquor and wine.

Harboring within the five enmities, he is called immoral.

With the breakup of the body, that unwise person is reborn in hell.

But there is a man in the world who does not destroy life, speak falsely, take what is not given, go to the wives of others, [206] or indulge in liquor and wine.

Having abandoned the five enmities, he is called virtuous.

With the breakup of the body, that wise person is reborn in heaven.

# 175 (5) Candaala

"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a lay follower is a candāla of a lay follower, a stain of a lay follower, the last among lay followers. ${ }^{1170}$ What five? (1) He is devoid of faith; (2) he is immoral; (3) he is superstitious and believes in auspicious signs, not in kamma; (4) he seeks outside here for a person worthy of offerings; ${ }^{1171}$ and (5) he first does [meritorious] deeds there. Possessing these five qualities, a lay follower is a candāla of a lay follower, a stain of a lay follower, the last among lay followers.

"Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a lay follower is a gem of a lay follower, a red lotus of a lay follower, a white lotus of a
lay follower. ${ }^{1172}$ What five? (1) He is endowed with faith; (2) he is virtuous; (3) he is not superstitious and believes in kamma, not in auspicious signs; (4) he does not seek outside here for a person worthy of offerings; and he first does [meritorious] deeds here. Possessing these five qualities, a lay follower is a gem of a lay follower, a red lotus of a lay follower, a white lotus of a lay follower."

# 176 (6) Räptüre

Then the householder Anāthapindika, accompanied by five hundred lay followers, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to the householder Anāthapindika [and his retinue]:

"Householders, you have presented robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick to the Sangha of bhikkhus. You should not be content merely with this much, [thinking]: 'We have presented robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick to the Sangha of bhikkhus.' Therefore, householders, you should train yourselves thus: [207] 'How can we from time to time enter and dwell in the rapture of solitude? ${ }^{1173}$ It is in such a way that you should train yourselves."

When this was said, the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Blessed One: "It's astounding and amazing, Bhante, how well that was said by the Blessed One. Bhante, whenever a noble. disciple enters and dwells in the rapture of solitude, on that occasion five things do not occur in him. (1) Pain and dejection connected with sensuality do not occur in him. (2) Pleasure and joy connected with sensuality do not occur in him. (3) Pain and dejection connected with the unwholesome do not occur in him. (4) Pleasure and joy connected with the unwholesome do not occur in him. (5) Pain and dejection connected with the wholesome do not occur in him. Bhante, whenever a noble disciple enters and dwells in the rapture of solitude, on that occasion these five things do not occur in him."

"Good, good, Sāriputta! Sāriputta, whenever [208] a noble disciple enters and dwells in the rapture of solitude... [The Buddha repeats in full the entire statement of the Venerable Sāriputta, down to:] ... on that occasion these five things do not occur in him."

# 177 (7) Trades

"Bhikkhus, a lay follower should not engage in these five trades. What five? Trading in weapons, trading in living beings, trading in meat, trading in intoxicants, and trading in poisons. A lay follower should not engage in these five trades."

## 178 (8) Kings

(1) "Bhikkhus, what do you think? Have you ever seen or heard that when a person abandons and abstains from the destruction of life, kings have him arrested on the charge of so abstaining and then execute him, imprison him, banish him, or do with him as the occasion demands?"

"Surely not, Bhante."

"Good, bhikkhus! I too have not seen or heard of such a thing. But rather [209] it is when they inform kings of his evil deed, saying: 'This person has taken the life of a woman or a man,' that kings have him arrested on the charge of taking life and then execute him, imprison him, banish him, or do with him as the occasion demands. Have you ever seen or heard of such a case?"

"We have seen this, Bhante, and we have heard of it, and we will hear of it [in time to come]."

(2) "Bhikkhus, what do you think? Have you ever seen or heard that when a person abandons and abstains from taking what is not given, kings have him arrested on the charge of so abstaining and then execute him, imprison him, banish him, or do with him as the occasion demands?"

"Surely not, Bhante."

"Good, bhikkhus! I too have not seen or heard of such a thing. But rather it is when they inform kings of his evil deed, saying: 'This person has stolen something from the village or forest,' that kings have him arrested on the charge of stealing and then execute him, imprison him, banish him, or do with him as the occasion demands. Have you ever seen or heard of such a case?"

"We have seen this, Bhante, and we have heard of it, and we will hear of it [in time to come]."

(3) "Bhikkhus, what do you think? Have you ever seen or heard that when a person abandons and abstains from sexual misconduct, kings have him arrested on the charge of so
abstaining and then execute him, imprison him, banish him, or do with him as the occasion demands?"

"Surely not, Bhante."

"Good, bhikkhus! I too have not seen or heard of such a thing. [210] But rather it is when they inform kings of his evil deed, saying: 'This man has committed misconduct with someone else's women and girls,' that kings have him arrested on the charge of sexual misconduct and then execute him, imprison him, banish him, or do with him as the occasion demands. Have you ever seen or heard of such a case?"

"We have seen this, Bhante, and we have heard of it, and we will hear of it [in time to come]."

(4) "Bhikkhus, what do you think? Have you ever seen or heard that when a person abandons and abstains from false speech, kings have him arrested on the charge of so abstaining and then execute him, imprison him, banish him, or do with him as the occasion demands?"

"Surely not, Bhante."

"Good, bhikkhus! I too have not seen or heard of such a thing. But rather it is when they inform kings of his evil deed, saying: 'This person has ruined a householder or a householder's son with false speech,' that kings have him arrested on the charge of false speech and then execute him, imprison him, banish him, or do with him as the occasion demands. Have you ever seen or heard of such a case?"

"We have seen this, Bhante, and we have heard of it, and we will hear of it [in time to come]."

(5) "Bhikkhus, what do you think? Have you ever seen or heard that when a person abandons and abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, kings have him arrested on the charge of so abstaining and then execute him, imprison him, banish him, or do with him as the occasion demands?"

"Surely not, Bhante."

"Good, bhikkhus! I too have not seen or heard of such a thing. [211] But rather it is when they inform kings of his evil deed, saying: 'This person, under the influence of liquor, wine, and intoxicants, has taken the life of a woman or a man; or he has stolen something from a village or a forest; or he has committed misconduct with someone else's women and girls; or he
has ruined a householder or a householder's son with false speech,' that kings have him arrested on the charge of using liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, and then execute him, imprison him, banish him, or do with him as the occasion demands. Have you ever seen or heard of such a case?"

"We have seen this, Bhante, and we have heard of it, and we will hear of it [in time to come]."

# 179 (9) A Layman

Then the householder Anāthapindika, accompanied by five hundred lay followers, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then addressed the Venerable Sāriputta: "You should know, Sāriputta, that any white-robed householder whose actions are restrained by five training rules and who gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, four pleasant visible dwellings that pertain to the higher mind, might, if he so wished, declare of himself: 'I am finished with hell, the animal realm, and the sphere of afflicted spirits; I am finished with the plane of misery, the bad destination, the lower world; I am a stream-enterer, no longer subject to [rebirth in] the lower world, fixed in destiny, heading for enlightenment.'

(1) "What are the five training rules by which his actions are restrained? [212] Here, Sāriputta, a noble disciple abstains from the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. His actions are restrained by these five training rules.

"What are the four pleasant visible dwellings that pertain to the higher mind, which he gains at will, without trouble or difficulty?

(2) "Here, the noble disciple possesses unwavering confidence in the Buddha thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' This is the first pleasant visible dwelling that pertains to the higher mind, which he has achieved for the purification of the impure mind, for the cleansing of the unclean mind.
(3) "Again, the noble disciple possesses unwavering confidence in the Dhamma thus: 'The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.' This is the second pleasant visible dwelling that pertains to the higher mind, which he has achieved for the purification of the impure mind, for the cleansing of the unclean mind.

(4) "Again, the noble disciple possesses unwavering confidence in the Sangha thus: 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is practicing the good way, practicing the straight way, practicing the true way, practicing the proper way; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individual-this Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.' This is the third pleasant visible dwelling that pertains to the higher mind, which he has achieved [213] for the purification of the impure mind, for the cleansing of the unclean mind.

(5) "Again, the noble disciple possesses the virtuous behavior loved by the noble ones, unbroken, flawless, unblemished, unblotched, freeing, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading to concentration. This is the fourth pleasant visible dwelling that pertains to the higher mind, which he has achieved for the purification of the impure mind, for the cleansing of the unclean mind.

"These are the four pleasant visible dwellings that pertain to the higher mind, which he gains at will, without trouble or difficulty.

"You should know, Sāriputta, that any white-robed householder whose actions are restrained by these five training rules and who gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, these four pleasant visible dwellings that pertain to the higher mind, might, if he so wished, declare of himself: 'I am finished with hell, the animal realm, and the sphere of afflicted spirits; I am finished with the plane of misery, the bad destination, the lower world; I am a stream-enterer, no longer subject to [rebirth in] the lower world, fixed in destiny, heading for enlightenment.'"

Having seen the peril in the hells, one should avoid evil deeds;
having undertaken the noble Dhamma, the wise one should avoid them.

To the utmost of one's ability, one should not injure living beings; one should not knowingly speak falsely; one should not take what is not given.

One should be content with one's own wives, ${ }^{1174}$ and should refrain from the wives of others. ${ }^{1175}$ A person should not drink wine and liquor, which cause mental confusion.

One should recollect the Buddha and ponder on the Dhamma.

One should develop a benevolent mind, which leads to the world of the devas.

When things to be given are available, for one needing and wanting merit ${ }^{1176}$ an offering becomes vast if first given to the holy ones.

I will describe the holy ones, Sāriputta, listen to me. ${ }^{1177}$ [214] Among cattle of any sort, whether black, white, red, or golden, mottled, uniform, or pigeon-colored, the tamed bull is born, the one that can bear the load, possessing strength, advancing with good speed. They yoke the burden just to him; they are not concerned about his color. So too, among human beings it is in any kind of birthamong khattiyas, brahmins, vessas, suddas, candālas, or scavengersamong people of any sort that the tamed person of good manners is born: one firm in Dhamma, virtuous in conduct, truthful in speech, endowed with moral shame;
one who has abandoned birth and death, consummate in the spiritual life, with the burden dropped, detached, who has done his task, free of taints; who has gone beyond all things [of the world] and by non-clinging has reached nibbāna: an offering is truly vast when planted in that spotless field.

Fools devoid of understanding, dull-witted, unlearned, do not attend on the holy ones but give their gifts to those outside. Those, however, who attend on the holy ones, on the wise ones esteemed as sagely, and those whose faith in the Fortunato One is deeply rooted and well established, go to the world of the devas or are born here in a good family. Advancing in successive steps, those wise ones attain nibbāna.

# 180.(10) Gavesi

On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Sangha of bhikkhus. Then, while traveling along the highway, the Blessed One saw a large sal-tree grove in a certain place. He left the highway, entered the sal-tree grove, and smiled when he reached a certain place.

Then it occurred to the Venerable Ānanda: "Why did the Blessed One smile? Tathāgatas do not smile without a reason." Then the Venerable Ānanda [215] said to the Blessed One: "Why, Bhante, did the Blessed One smile? Tathāgatas do not smile without a reason."

"In the past, Ānanda, in this place there was an affluent, prosperous, well-populated city, one teeming with people. Now the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One Kassapa lived in dependence on that city. The Blessed One Kassapa had a lay follower named Gavesi who had not fulfilled virtuous behavior. And Gavesi taught and guided five hundred lay followers who had not fulfilled virtuous behavior.

(1) "Then, Ānanda, it occurred to Gavesi: 'I am the benefactor,
the leader, and the guide of these five hundred lay followers, yet neither I myself nor these five hundred lay followers have fulfilled virtuous behavior. Thus we are on the same level, and I am not the least bit better. Let me surpass them.'

"Then Gavesī approached the five hundred lay followers and said to them: 'From today on, you should consider me to be one fulfilling virtuous behavior.' Then it occurred to those five hundred lay followers: 'Master Gavesī is our benefactor, leader, and guide. Now Master Gavesī will fulfill virtuous behavior. Why shouldn't we do so too?'

"Then those five hundred lay followers approached Gavesī and said to him: 'From today onward let Master Gavesī consider us to be fulfilling virtuous behavior:'

(2) "Then, Ānanda, it occurred to the lay follower Gavesī: 'I am the benefactor, leader, and guide of these five hundred lay followers. Now I am fulfilling virtuous behavior, and so too are these five hundred lay followers. [216] Thus we are on the same level, and I am not the least bit better. Let me surpass them.'

"Then Gavesī approached the five hundred lay followers and said to them: 'From today on, you should consider me to be celibate, living apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the common person's practice.' Then it occurred to those five hundred lay followers: 'Master Gavesī is our benefactor, leader, and guide. Now Master Gavesī will be celibate, living apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the common person's practice. Why shouldn't we do so too?'

"Then those five hundred lay followers approached Gavesi and said to him: 'From today onward let Master Gavesī consider us to be celibate, living apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the common person's practice.'

(3) "Then, Ānanda, it occurred to the lay follower Gavesī: 'I am the benefactor, leader, and guide of these five hundred lay followers. Now I am fulfilling virtuous behavior, and so too are these five hundred lay followers. I am celibate, living apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the common person's practice, and so too are these five hundred lay followers. Thus we are on the same level, and I am not the least bit better. Let me surpass them.'

"Then Gavesī approached the five hundred lay followers and said to them: 'From today on, you should consider me to be eat-
ing once a day, refraining from a night meal, abstaining from eating outside the proper time.' Then it occurred to those five hundred lay followers: 'Master Gavesī is our benefactor, leader, and guide. Now Master Gavesī eats once a day, refraining from a night meal, abstaining from eating outside the proper time. Why shouldn't we do so too?'

"Then those five hundred lay followers approached Gavesī and [217] said to him: 'From today onward let Master Gavesī consider us to be eating once a day, refraining from a night meal, abstaining from eating outside the proper time.'

(4) "Then, Ānanda, it occurred to the lay follower Gavesī: 'I am the benefactor, leader, and guide of these five hundred lay followers. Now I am fulfilling virtuous behavior, and so too are these five hundred lay followers. I am celibate, living apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the common person's practice, and so too are these five hundred lay followers. I eat once a day, refraining from a night meal, abstaining from eating outside the proper time, and so too do these five hundred lay followers. Thus we are on the same level, and I am not the least bit better. Let me surpass them.'

"Then Gavesī approached the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One Kassapa, and said to him: 'Bhante, may I obtain the going forth and full ordination under the Blessed One?' The lay follower Gavesī obtained the going forth and full ordination under the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One Kassapa. Soon after his full ordination, dwelling alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute, the bhikkhu Gavesī realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having entered upon it, he dwelled in it. He directly knew: 'Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.' And the bhikkhu Gavesī became one of the arahants.

"Then, Ānanda, it occurred to those five hundred lay followers: 'Master Gavesī is our bènefactor, leader, and guide. Now Master Gavesī, having shaved off his hair and beard and put on ochre robes, has gone forth from the household life into homelessness. Why shouldn't we do so too?'
"Then those five hundred lay followers approached the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One Kassapa, [218] and said to him: 'Bhante, may we obtain the going forth and full ordination under the Blessed One?' Then those five hundred lay followers obtained the going forth and full ordination under the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One Kassapa.

(5) "Then, Ānanda, it occurred to the bhikkhu Gavesī: 'I obtain at will, without trouble or difficulty, the unsurpassed bliss of liberation. Oh, that these five hundred bhikkhus could obtain at will, without trouble or difficulty, the unsurpassed bliss of liberation!' Then, Ānanda, dwelling each alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute, in no long time those five hundred bhikkhus realized for themselves with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having entered upon it, they dwelled in it. They directly knew: 'Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.'

"Thus, Ānanda, those five hundred bhikkhus headed by Gavesi, striving in successively higher and more sublime ways, realized the unsurpassed bliss of liberation. ${ }^{1178}$ Therefore, Ānanda, you should train yourselves thus: 'Striving in successively higher and more sublime ways, we will realize the unsurpassed bliss of liberation.' Thus, Ānanda, should you train yourselves." [219]

# IV. FOREST DWELLERS

## 181 (1) Forest Dwellers

"Bhikkhus, there are these five kinds of forest dwellers. What five? (1) One who becomes a forest dweller because of his dullness and stupidity; (2) one who becomes a forest dweller because he has evil desires, because he is driven by desire; ${ }^{1179}$ (3) one who becomes a forest dweller because he is mad and mentally deranged; (4) one who becomes a forest dweller, [thinking]: 'It is praised by the Buddhas and the Buddhas' disciples'; (5) and one who becomes a forest dweller for the sake of fewness of desires, for the sake of contentment, for the sake of eliminating
[defilements], for the sake of solitude, for the sake of simplicity. These are the five kinds of forest dwellers. One who becomes a forest dweller for the sake of fewness of desires, for the sake of contentment, for the sake of eliminating [defilements], for the sake of solitude, for the sake of simplicity, is the foremost, the best, the preeminent, the supreme, and the finest of these five kinds of forest dwellers.

"Just as, bhikkhus, from a cow comes milk, from milk comes curd, from curd comes butter, from butter comes ghee, and from ghee comes cream-of-ghee, which is reckoned the foremost of all these, so one who becomes a forest dweller for the sake of fewness of desires... for the sake of simplicity, is the foremost, the best, the preeminent, the supreme, and the finest of these five kinds of forest dwellers."

182 (2)-190(10) Wearers of Rag-Robes, Etc.

"Bhikkhus, there are these five kinds of wearers of rag-robes ${ }^{1180}$ . . . these five who dwell at the foot of a tree ... [220] . . . these five who dwell in a charnel ground ... these five who dwell in the open air . . . these five who observe the sitter's practice . . . these five who observe the any-bed-user's practice . . . these five who observe the one-session practice . . . these five who observe the later-food-refuser's practice... these five who observe the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl. What five? (1) One who observes the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl because of his dullness and stupidity; (2) one who observes the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl because he has evil desires, because he is driven by desire; (3) one who observes the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl because he is mad and mentally deranged; (4) one who observes the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl, [thinking]: 'It is praised by the Buddhas and Buddhas' disciples'; (5) and one who observes the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl for the sake of fewness of desires, for the sake of contentment, for the sake of eliminating [defilements], for the sake of solitude, for the sake of simplicity. These are the five who observe the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl. One who observes the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl for the sake of fewness of desires... for the sake of simplicity, is the foremost, the best, the preeminent, the supreme, and the
finest of these five who observe the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl.

"Just as, bhikkhus, from a cow comes milk, from milk comes. curd, from curd comes butter, from butter comes ghee, and from ghee comes cream-of-ghee, which is reckoned the foremost of all these, so this one who observes the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl [221] for the sake of fewness of desires... for the sake of simplicity, is the foremost, the best, the preeminent, the supreme, and the finest of these five who observe the practice of eating only food in the almsbowl."

# V. DoGs

191 (1) Dogs

"Bhikkhus, there are these five ancient brahmin practices that are now seen among dogs but not among brahmins. What five?

(1) "In the past, brahmins coupled only with brahmin women, not with non-brahmin women. But now brahmins couple with both brahmin women and non-brahmin women. Dogs, however, still couple only with female dogs, not with other female animals. This is the first ancient brahmin practice that is now seen among dogs but not among brahmins.

(2) "In the past, brahmins coupled with brahmin women only when they were in season, not out of season. But now [222] brahmins couple with brahmin women both when they are in season and out of season. Dogs, however, still couple with female dogs only when they are in season, not out of season. This is the second ancient brahmin practice that is now seen among dogs but not among brahmins.

(3) "In the past, brahmins did not buy and sell brahmin women, and they would initiate cohabitation only through mutual affection, doing so for the sake of family continuity. ${ }^{1181}$ But now brahmins buy and sell brahmin women, and they initiate cohabitation both through mutual affection and without mutual affection, doing so for the sake of family continuity. ${ }^{1182}$ Dogs, however, still do not buy and sell female dogs, and they initiate cohabitation only through mutual affection, doing so for the sake of family continuity. This is the third ancient brahmin practice that is now seen among dogs but not among brahmins.
(4) "In the past, brahmins did not store up wealth, grain, silver, and gold. But now brahmins store up wealth, grain, silver, and gold. Dogs, however, still do not store up wealth, grain, silver, and gold. This is the fourth ancient brahmin practice that is now seen among dogs but not among brahmins.

(5) "In the past, brahmins went seeking almsfood in the evening for their evening meal and in the morning for their morning meal. But now brahmins eat as much as they want until their bellies are full, and then leave taking the leftovers away. Dogs, however, still go seeking food in the evening for their evening meal and in the morning for their morning meal. This is the fifth ancient brahmin practice that is now seen among dogs but not among brahmins.

"These, bhikkhus, are the five ancient brahmin practices that are now seen among dogs but not among brahmins." [223]

# 192 (2) Dona

Then the brahmin Dona approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When he had concluded his greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One: "I have heard, Master Gotama: 'The ascetic Gotama does not pay homage to brahmins who are old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage; nor does he stand up for them or offer them a seat. ${ }^{1183}$ This is indeed true, for Master Gotama does not pay homage to brahmins who are old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage; nor does he stand up for them or offer them a seat. This is not proper, Master Gotama."

"Do you too claim to be a brahmin, Dona?"

"Master Gotama, if one could rightly say of anyone: 'He is a brahmin well born on both his maternal and paternal sides, of pure descent, unassailable and impeccable with respect to birth as far back as the seventh paternal generation; he is a reciter and preserver of the hymns, a master of the three Vedas with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology, and etymology, and the histories as a fifth; skilled in philology and grammar, he is fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a great man'-it is precisely of me that one might say this. For I, Master Gotama, am a brahmin well born on both his maternal and paternal sides, of pure descent, unassailable and impeccable with respect to birth as far back as the seventh paternal
generation. I am a reciter and preserver of the hymns, a master of the three Vedas with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology, and etymology, and the histories as a fifth; skilled in philology and grammar, I am fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a great man."

"Doṇa, the ancient [224] seers among the brahmin-that is, Atṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Angīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāṣeṭtha, Kassapa, and Bhagu-were the creators of the hymns and the composers of the hymns, and it is their ancient hymns, formerly chanted, declared, and compiled, that the brahmins nowadays still chant and repeat, repeating what was spoken, reciting what was recited, and teaching what was taught. Those ancient seers described these five kinds of brahmins: the one similar to Brahmā, the one similar to a deva, the one who remains within the boundary, the one who has crossed the boundary, and the candāla of a brahmin as the fifth. Which of these are you, Doṇa?"

"We do not know these five kinds of brahmins, Master Gotama. All we know is [the word] 'brahmins.' Please, let Master Gotama teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might know these five kinds of brahmins."

"Then listen, brahmin, and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, sir," the brahmin Doṇa replied. The Blessed One said this:

(1) "And how, Doṇa, is a brahmin similar to Brahmā? Here, a brahmin is well born on both his maternal and paternal sides, of pure descent, unassailable and impeccable with respect to birth as far back as the seventh paternal generation. He lives the spiritual life of virginal celibacy ${ }^{1184}$ for forty-eight years, studying the hymns. He then seeks a teacher's fee for his teacher solely in accordance with the Dhamma, not contrary to the Dhamma. And what, Doṇa, is the Dhamma in that case? [225] Not by agriculture, not by trade, not by raising cattle, not by archery, not by service to the king, not by a particular craft, but solely by wandering for alms without scorning the alms bowl. Having offered the teacher's fee to his teacher, he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness. ${ }^{1185}$ When he has gone forth, he dwells pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with lovingkindness, likewise the second quarter, the third quarter, and the
fourth quarter. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will. He dwells pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with compassion . . . with a mind imbued with altruistic joy ... with a mind imbued with equanimity, likewise the second quarter, the third quarter, and the fourth quarter. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with equanimity, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will. Having developed these four divine abodes, ${ }^{186}$ with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in a good destination, in the brahmā world. In this way a brahmin is similar to Brahmā.

(2) "And how, Dona, is a brahmin similar to a deva? Here, a brahmin is well born on both his maternal and paternal sides, of pure descent, unassailable and impeccable with respect to birth as far back as the seventh paternal generation. He lives the spiritual life of virginal celibacy for forty-eight years, studying the hymns. He then seeks a teacher's fee for his teacher solely in accordance with the Dhamma, not contrary to the Dhamma. And what, Dona, is the Dhamma in that case? Not by agriculture, not by trade, not by raising cattle, not by archery, not by service to the king, not by a particular craft, but solely by wandering for alms [226] without scorning the alms bowl. Having offered the teacher's fee to his teacher, he seeks a wife solely in accordance with the Dhamma, not contrary to the Dhamma. And what, Dona, is the Dhamma in that case? Not by buying and selling, [he takes] only a brahmin woman given to him by the pouring of water. He couples only with a brahmin woman, not with a khattiya woman, a vessa woman, a sudda woman, or a candāla woman, nor with a woman from a family of hunters, bamboo workers, chariot makers, or flower scavengers. He does not couple with a pregnant woman, nor with a woman who is nursing, nor with a woman out of season.

"And why, Dona, doesn't the brahmin couple with a pregnant woman? Because, if he were to couple with a pregnant woman, the little boy or girl would be born in excessive filth; therefore he does not couple with a pregnant woman. And why doesn't he couple with a woman who is nursing? Because, if he
were to couple with a woman who is nursing, the little boy or girl would drink back the foul substance; ${ }^{1187}$ therefore he does not couple with a woman who is nursing. Why doesn't he couple with a woman out of season? Because his brahmin wife does not serve for sensual pleasure, amusement, and sensual delight, but only for procreation. ${ }^{1188}$ When he has engaged in sexual activity, he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness. When he has gone forth, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states... he enters and dwells in the first jhāna . . . [as in 5:14] . . . the fourth jhāna. Having developed these four jhānas, [227] with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. In this way a brahmin is similar to a deva.

(3) "And how, Doṇa, is a brahmin one who remains within the boundary? Here, a brahmin is well born on both his maternal and paternal sides, of pure descent, unassailable and impeccable with respect to birth as far back as the seventh paternal generation. He lives the spiritual life of virginal celibacy for forty-eight years.... [all as above down to] . . . Because his brahmin wife does not serve for sensual pleasure, amusement, or sensual delight, but only for procreation. When he has engaged in sexual activity, out of attachment to his sons he remains settled on his property and does not go forth from the household life into homelessness. He stops at the boundary of the ancient brahmins but does not violate it. Since he stops at the boundary of the ancient brahmins but does not violate it, he is called a brahmin who remains within the boundary. It is in this way that a brahmin is one who remains within the boundary.

(4) "And how, Doṇa, is a brahmin one who has crossed the boundary? [228] Here, a brahmin is well born on both his maternal and paternal sides, of pure descent, unassailable and impeccable with respect to birth as far back as the seventh paternal generation. He lives the spiritual life of virginal celibacy for forty-eight years, studying the hymns. He then seeks a teacher's fee for his teacher solely in accordance with the Dhamma, not contrary to the Dhamma. And what, Doṇa, is the Dhamma in that case? Not by agriculture, not by trade, not by raising cattle, not by archery, not by service to the king, not by a particular
craft, but solely by wandering for alms without scorning the alms bowl. Having offered the teacher's fee to his teacher, he seeks a wife both in accordance with the Dhamma and contrary to the Dhamma. [He takes a wife] by buying and selling as well as a brahmin woman given to him by the pouring of water. He couples with a brahmin woman, a khattiya woman, a vessa woman, a sudda woman, and a candāla woman, and a woman from a family of hunters, bamboo workers, chariot makers, or flower scavengers. He couples with a pregnant woman, a woman who is nursing, a woman in season, and a woman out of season. His brahmin wife serves for sensual pleasure, amusement, and sensual delight, as well as for procreation. ${ }^{1189} \mathrm{He}$ does not stop at the boundary of the ancient brahmins but violates it. Since he does not stop at the boundary of the ancient brahmins but violates it, he is called a brahmin who has crossed the boundary. It is in this way that a brahmin is one who has crossed the boundary.

(5) "And how, Doṇa, is a brahmin a candāla of a brahmin? Here, a brahmin is well born on both his maternal and paternal sides, of pure descent, unassailable and impeccable with respect to birth as far back as the seventh paternal generation. He [229] lives the spiritual life of virginal celibacy for forty-eight years, studying the hymns. He then seeks a teacher's fee for his teacher both in accordance with the Dhamma and contrary to the Dhamma-by agriculture, by trade, by raising cattle, by archery, by service to the king, by a particular craft, and not only ${ }^{1190}$ by wandering for alms without scorning the alms bowl. Having offered the teacher's fee to his teacher, he seeks a wife both in accordance with the Dhamma and contrary to the Dhamma. [He takes a wife] by buying and selling as well as a brahmin woman given to him by the pouring of water. He couples with a brahmin woman, a khattiya woman, a vessa woman, a sudda woman, and a candāla woman, and a woman from a family of hunters, bamboo workers, chariot makers, or flower scavengers. He couples with a pregnant woman, a woman who is nursing, a woman in season, and a woman out of season. His brahmin wife serves for sensual pleasure, amusement, and sensual delight, as well as for procreation. He earns his living by all kinds of work. Brahmins say to him: 'Why, sir, while claiming to be a brahmin, do you earn your living by all kinds
of work?' He answers them: 'Just as fire burns pure things and impure things yet is not thereby defiled, so too, sirs, if a brahmin earns his living by all kinds of work, he is not thereby defiled.' Since he earns his living by all kinds of work, this brahmin is called a candāla of a brahmin. It is in this way that a brahmin is a candāla of a brahmin.

"Dona, the ancient seers among the brahmin-that is, Atṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgīrasa; Bhāradvāja, [230] Vāsetṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu-were the creators of the hymns and the composers of the hymns, and it is their ancient hymns, formerly chanted, declared, and compiled, that the brahmins nowadays still chant and repeat, repeating what was spoken, reciting what was recited, and teaching what was taught. Those ancient seers described these five kinds of brahmins: the one similar to Brahmā, the one similar to a deva, the one who remains within the boundary, the one who has crossed the boundary, and the candāla of a brahmin as the fifth. Which of these are you, Dona?"

"Such being the case, Master Gotama, we do not even measure up to the candāla of a brahmin. Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the darkness so those with good eyesight can see forms. I now go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

# 193 (3) Sangārava ${ }^{1191}$

Then the brahmin Sangārava approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

"Master Gotama, why is it that sometimes even those hymns that have been recited over a long period do not recur to the mind, let alone those that have not been so recited? Why is it that sometimes even those hymns that have not been recited over a long period recur to the mind, let alone those that have been so recited?"

# 194 (4) Kāranapālī

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Now on that occasion the brahmin Kāranapālī was getting some work done for the Licchavis. ${ }^{1194}$ The brahmin Kāranapālī saw the brahmin Pingiyānī [237] coming in the distance and said to him:

"Where is Master Pingiyāni coming from in the middle of the day?"

"I am coming, sir, from the presence of the ascetic Gotama."1195

"What do you think of the ascetic Gotama's competence in wisdom? Do you consider him wise?"

"Who am I, sir, that I could know the ascetic Gotama's competence in wisdom? Certainly, only one like him could know his competence in wisdom!"
"You praise the ascetic Gotama with lofty praise, indeed."

"Who am I, sir, that I could praise the ascetic Gotama? Praised by those who are praised, Master Gotama is best among devas and humans!"

"What grounds do you see, Master Pingiyāni, for placing such full confidence in the ascetic Gotama?"

(1) "Just as a man who has found satisfaction in the best of tastes will no longer desire tastes of an inferior kind; so too, sir, whatever one hears of Master Gotama's Dhamma-be it discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, or amazing accounts-one will no longer yearn for the doctrines of ordinary ascetics and brahmins. ${ }^{1196}$

(2) "Just as a man oppressed by hunger and weakness who receives a honey cake will enjoy a sweet, delicious taste wherever he eats of it; so too, sir, whatever one hears of Master Gotama's Dhamma-discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, or amazing accounts-one will obtain satisfaction and placidity of mind.

(3) "Just as a man who comes upon a piece of sandalwood, whether yellow sandalwood or red sandalwood, will enjoy a pure, fragrant scent wherever he smells it, be it at the bottom, the middle, or the top [238]; so too, sir, whatever one hears of Master Gotama's Dhamma-discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, or amazing accounts-one will derive elation and joy.

(4) "Just as a capable physician might instantly cure one who is afflicted, sick, and gravely ill; so too, sir, whatever one hears of Master Gotama's Dhamma-discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, or amazing accounts-one's sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish will vanish.

(5) "Just as there might be a delightful pond with pleasant banks, its water clear, agreeable, cool, and limpid, and a man oppressed and exhausted by the heat, fatigued, parched, and thirsty, might come by, enter the pond, and bathe and drink; thus all his affliction, fatigue, and feverish burning would subside. So too, sir, whatever one hears of Master Gotama's Dhamma-discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, or amazing accounts-all one's affliction, fatigue, and feverish burning subside."

When this was said, the brahmin Kāranapālī rose from his
seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, and placing his right knee on the ground, he reverently saluted the Blessed One and uttered three times these inspired words:

"Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One! Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One! Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One!

"Excellent, Master Pingiyānī! Excellent, Master Pingiyāni! Master Pingiyānī has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, [239] or holding up a lamp in the darkness so those with good sight can see forms. Master Pingiyāni, I now go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus, Let Master Pingiyānī consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

# 195 (5) Pingiyānī

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Now on that occasion five hundred Licchavis were visiting the Blessed One. Some Licchavis were blue, with a blue complexion, clothed in blue, wearing blue ornaments. Some Licchavis were yellow, with a yellow complexion, clothed in yellow, wearing yellow ornaments. Some Licchavis were red, with a red complexion, clothed in red, wearing red ornaments. Some Licchavis were white, with a white complexion, clothed in white, wearing white ornaments. Yet the Blessed One outshione them all with his beauty and glory.

Then the brahmin Pingiyāni rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, and having reverently saluted the Blessed One, he said: "An inspiration has come to me, Blessed One! An inspiration has come to me, Fortunate One!"

"Then express your inspiration, Pingiyāni," the Blessed One said. ${ }^{1197}$ Then, in the presence of the Blessed One, the brahmin Pingiyānī extolled him with an appropriate verse: ${ }^{1198}$

"As the fragrant red kokanada lotus

blooms in the morning, its fragrance unspent, behold Angirasa radiant

like the sun beaming in the sky."

Then those Licchavis presented the brahmin Pingiyāni with five hundred upper robes. The brahmin Pingiyāni presented those five hundred upper robes to the Blessed One. [240] The Blessed One then said to those Licchavis:

"Licchavis, the manifestation of five gems is rare in the world. ${ }^{1199}$ What five? (1) The manifestation of a Tathāgata, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One is rare in the world. (2) A person who can teach the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by a Tathāgata is rare in the world. (3) When the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by a Tathāgata has been taught, a person who can understand it is rare in the world. (4) When the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by a Tathāgata has been taught, a person who can understand it and practice in accordance with the Dhamma is rare in the world. (5) A grateful and thankful person is rare in the world. Licchavis, the manifestation of these five gems is rare in the world."

# 196 (6) Dreams

"Bhikkhus, before his enlightenment, while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened, five great dreams appeared to the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. What five?

(1) "Before his enlightenment, while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened, the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One [dreamt] that this mighty earth was his bedstead; the Himālaya, king of mountains, was his pillow; his left hand rested on the eastern sea; his right hand on the western sea, and his two feet on the southern sea. This was the first great dream that appeared to the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One before his enlightenment, while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened.

(2) "Again, before his enlightenment... the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One [dreamt] that a kind of grass called tiriy $\bar{a}$ rose up from his navel and stood touching the sky. [241] This was the second great dream that appeared to the Tathāgata... while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened.

(3) "Again, before his enlightenment... the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One [dreamt] that white worms with black heads crawled from his feet up to his knees and covered them. This was the third great dream that appeared
to the Tathāgata... while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened.

(4) "Again, before his enlightenment . . . the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One [dreamt] that four birds of different colors came from the four quarters, fell at his feet, and turned all white. This was the fourth great dream that appeared to the Tathāgata . . . while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened.

(5) "Again, before his enlightenment . . . the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One [dreamt] that he climbed up a huge mountain of dung without being soiled by it. This was the fifth great dream that appeared to the Tathāgata . . . while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened.

(1) "Now, bhikkhus, when the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One-before his enlightenment, while just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened-[dreamt] that this mighty earth was his bedstead and the Himālaya, king of mountains, his pillow; that his left hand rested on the eastern sea, his right hand on the western sea, and his two feet on the southern sea, [this was a foretoken] that he would awaken to the unsurpassed, perfect enlightenment. ${ }^{1200}$ This first great dream appeared to him [as a sign] that his awakening [was imminent]. ${ }^{1201}$ [242]

(2) "When the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One ... [dreamt] that tiriyā grass rose up from his navel and stood touching the sky, [this was a foretoken] that he would awaken to the noble eightfold path and would proclaim it well among devas and humans. This second great dream appeared to him [as a sign] that his awakening [was imminent].

(3) "When the Tathāgata, the Arahani, the Perfectly Enlightened One...[dreamt] that white worms with black heads crawled from his feet up to his knees and covered them, [this was a foretoken] that many white-robed householders would go for lifelong refuge to the Tathāgata. This third great dream appeared to him [as a sign] that his awakening [was imminent].

(4) "When the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One ... [dreamt] that four birds of different colors came from the four quarters, fell at his feet, and turned all white, [this was a foretoken] that members of the four classes-khattiyas;
brahmins, vessas, and suddas-would go forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata and realize unsurpassed liberation. This fourth great dream appeared to him [as a sign] that his awakening [was imminent].

(5) "When the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One ... [dreamt] that he climbed up a huge mountain of dung without being soiled by it, [this was a foretoken] that he would receive robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines and provisions for the sick, and he would use them without being tied to them, infatuated with them, and blindly absorbed in them, seeing the danger and knowing the escape. This fifth great dream appeared to him [as a sign] that his awakening [was imminent].

"These, bhikkhus, were the five great dreams that appeared to the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, before his enlightenment, while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened." [243]

# 197 (7) Rain

"Bhikkhus, there are these five obstacles to rain that the forecasters do not know about, where their eyes do not tread. ${ }^{\text {tars }}$ What five?

(1) "Bhikkhus, the heat element in the upper regions of the sky becomes disturbed. Because of this, the clouds that have arisen are scattered. This is the first obstacle to rain that the forecasters do not know about, where their eyes do not tread.

(2) "Again, the air element in the upper regions of the sky becomes disturbed. Because of this, the clouds that have arisen are scattered. This is the second obstacle to rain....

198 (8) Speech

"Bhikkhus, possessing five factors, speech is well spoken, not badly spoken; it is blameless and beyond reproach by the wise. What five? [244] It is spoken at the proper time; what is said is true; it is spoken gently; what is said is beneficial; it is spoken with a mind of loving-kindness. Possessing these five factors, speech is well spoken, not badly spoken; it is blameless and beyond reproach by the wise."

# 199 (9) Families

"Bhikkhus; whenever virtuous monastics ${ }^{1203}$ come to a home, the people there generate much merit on five grounds. What five? (1) When people see virtuous monastics come to their home and they arouse hearts of confidence [toward them], on that occasion that family is practicing the way conducive to heaven. (2) When people rise, pay homage, and offer a seat to virtuous monastics who come to their home, on that occasion that family is practicing the way conducive to birth in high families. (3) When people remove the stain of miserliness toward virtuous monastics who come to their home, on that occasion that family is practicing the way conducive to great influence. (4) When, according to their means, people share what they have with virtuous monastics who come to their home, on that occasion that family is practicing the way conducive to great wealth. (5) When people question virtuous monastics who come to their home, make inquiries about the teachings, and listen to the Dhamma, on that occasion that family is practicing the way conducive to great wisdom. [245] Bhikkhus, whenever virtuous monastics come to a home, the people there generate much merit on these five grounds."

## 200 (10) Escape

"Bhikkhus, there are these five elements of escape. ${ }^{1204}$ What five?

(1) "Here, when a bhikkhu is attending to sensual pleasures, ${ }^{1205}$ his mind does not launch out upon them, and become placid, settled, and focused on them. ${ }^{1206}$ But when he is attending to renunciation, his mind launches out upon it and becomes placid, settled, and focused on it. His mind is well departed, ${ }^{1207}$ well developed, well emerged, well liberated, and well detached from sensual pleasures. And he is freed from those taints, dis-
tressful and feverish, that arise with sensual pleasures as condition. He does not feel that kind of feeling. ${ }^{1208}$ This is declared to be the escape from sensual pleasures.

(2) "Again, when a bhikkhu is attending to ill will, his mind does not launch out upon it, and become placid, settled, and focused on it. But when he is attending to good will, his mind launches out upon it and becomes placid, settled, and focused on it. His mind is well departed, well developed, well emerged, well liberated, and well detached from ill will. And he is freed from those taints, distressful and feverish, that arise with ill will as condition. He does not feel that kind of feeling. This is declared to be the escape from ill will.

(3) "Again, when a bhikkhu is attending to harming, his mind does not launch out upon it and become placid, settled, and focused on it. But when he is attending to non-harming, his mind launches out upon it and becomes placid, settled, and focused on it. His mind is well departed, well developed, well emerged, well liberated, and well detached from harming. And he is freed from those taints, distressful and feverish, that arise with harming as condition. He does not feel that kind of feeling. This is declared to be the escape from harming. [246]

(4) "Again, when a bhikkhu is attending to form, his mind does not launch out upon it and become placid, settled, and focused on it. But when he is attending to the formless, his mind launches out upon it and becomes placid, settled, and focused on it. His mind is well departed, well developed, well emerged, well liberated, and well detached from form. And he is freed from those taints, distressful and feverish, that arise with form as condition. He does not feel that kind of feeling. This is declared to be the escape from form.

(5) "Again, when a bhikkhu is attending to personal existence, his mind does not launch out upon it and become placid, settled, and focused on it. But when he is attending to the cessation of personal existence, his mind launches out upon it and becomes placid, settled, and focused on it. His mind is well departed, well developed, well emerged, well liberated, and well detached from personal existence. And he is freed from those taints, distressful and feverish, that arise with personal existence as condition. He does not feel that feeling. This is declared to be the escape from personal existence.

"Delight in sensual pleasures does not lie within him; delight
in ill will does not lie within him; delight in harming does not lie within him; delight in form does not lie within him; delight in personal existence does not lie within him. Because he is without the underlying tendencies toward delight in sensual pleasures, delight in ill will, delight in harming, delight in form, and delight in personal existence, he is called a bhikkhu devoid of underlying tendencies. He has cut off craving, stripped off the fetter, and by completely breaking through conceit, he has made an end of suffering. These, bhikkhus, are the five elements of escape." [247]

"(1) Here, Kimbila, after a Tathāgata has attained final nibbāna, the bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, male lay followers, and female lay followers dwell without reverence and deference toward the Teacher.

"Bhikkhus, there are these five benefits in listening to the Dhamma. What five? One hears what one has not heard; one clarifies what has been heard; one emerges from perplexity; one. straightens out one's view; one's mind becomes placid. These are the five benefits in listening to the Dhamma."

him. It occurs to the one [who had such confidence in him]: 'The person who is pleasing and agreeable to me has been suspended by the Sangha.' He then loses much of his confidence in bhikkhus. Since he has lost much of his confidence in them, he does not associate with other bhikkhus. Since he does not associate with other bhikkhus, he does not get to hear the good Dhamma. Since he does not get to hear the good Dhamma, he falls away from the good Dhamma. This is the first danger in basing one's confidence on a person.

(2) "Again, the person in whom another has complete confidence may commit an offense because of which the Sangha makes him sit at the end. ${ }^{1233}$ It occurs to the one [who had such confidence in him]: 'The Sangha has made the person who is pleasing and agreeable to me sit at the end.' He then loses much of his confidence in bhikkhus:... Since he does not get to hear the good Dhamma, he falls away from the good Dhamma. This is the second danger in basing one's confidence on a person.

(3) "Again, the person in whom another has complete confidence may depart for some other quarter... (4) ... may disrobe... (5) ... may pass away. It occurs to the one [who had such confidence in him]: 'The person who was pleasing and agreeable to me [has departed for some other quarter... has disrobed ...] has passed away. ${ }^{1234}$ He does not associate with other bhikkhus. Since he does not associate with other bhikkhus, he does not get to hear the good Dhamma. Since he does not get to hear the good Dhamma, he falls away from the good Dhamma. This is the fifth danger in basing one's confidence on a person.

"These, bhikkhus, are the five dangers in basing one's confidence on a person." [271]

# The Book of the Sixes

## Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One

## The First Fifty

## I. WORTHY OF GIFTS

1 (1) Worthy of Gifts (1)

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇ̣ika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, possessing six qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What six? (1) Here, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu is neither joyful nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending. ${ }^{1291}$ (2) Having heard a sound with the ear, a bhikkhu is neither joyful nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending. (3) Having smelled an odor with the nose, a bhikkhu is neither joyful nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending. (4) Having experienced a taste with the tongue, a bhikkhu is neither joyful nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending. (5) Having felt a tactile object with the body, a bhikkhu is neither joyful nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending. (6) Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, a bhikkhu is neither joyful nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly
comprehending. Possessing these six qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed One's statement. [280]

# 2 (2) Worthy of Gifts (2)

"Bhikkhus, possessing six qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What six? ${ }^{1252}$

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu wields the various kinds of psychic potency: having been one, he becomes many; having been many, he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he goes unhindered through a wall, through a rampart, through a mountain as though through space; he dives in and out of the earth as though it were water; he walks on water without sinking as though it were earth; seated cross-legged, he travels in space like a bird; with his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; he exercises mastery with the body as far as the brahmā world.

(2) "With the divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the human, he hears both kinds of sounds, the divine and human, those that are far as well as near.

(3) "He understands the minds of other beings and persons, having encompassed them with his own mind. He understands a mind with lust as a mind with lust and a mind without lust as a mind without lust; a mind with hatred as a mind with hatred and a mind without hatred as a mind without hatred; a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion; a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted; an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted; a surpassable mind as surpassable and an unsurpassable mind as unsurpassable; a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated; a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated.

(4) "He recollects his manifold past abodes, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty [281] births, a hundred
births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many eons of world-dissolution, many eons of world-evolution, many eons of world-dissolution and world-evolution thus: 'There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere, and there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn here.' Thus he recollects his manifold past abodes with their aspects and details.

(5) "With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma thus: 'These beings who engaged in misconduct by body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong view, and undertook kamma based on wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; but these beings who engaged in good conduct by body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right view, and undertook kamma based on right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.' Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma.

(6) "With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.

"Possessing these six qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

# 3 (3) Faculties

"Bhikkhus, possessing six qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world.

What six? [282] The faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, the faculty of wisdom; and with the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. Possessing these six qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

# 4 (4) Powers

The power of faith, the power of energy, the power. of mindfulness, the power of concentration, the power of wisdom; and with the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it. Possessing these six qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

## 5 (5) Thoroughbred (1)

"Bhikkhus, possessing six factors, a king's excellent thoroughbred horse is worthy of a king, an accessory of a king, and reckoned as a factor of kingship. What six? Here, a king's excellent thoroughbred horse patiently endures forms, patiently endures sounds, patiently endures odors, patiently endures tastes, patiently endures tactile objects, and it is endowed with beauty. Possessing these six factors, a king's excellent thoroughbred horse is worthy of a king, an accessory of a king, and reckoned as a factor of kingship. ${ }^{1253}$

"So too, possessing six qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What six? [283] Here, a bhikkhu patiently endures forms, patiently endures sounds, patiently endures odors, patiently endures tastes, patiently endures tactile objects, and patiently endures
mental phenomena. Possessing these six qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

# 6 (6) Thoroughbred (2)

"Bhikkhus, possessing six factors, a king's excellent thoroughbred horse is worthy of a king, an accessory of a king, and reckoned as a factor of kingship. What six? Here, a king's excellent thoroughbred horse patiently endures forms, patiently endures sounds, patiently endures odors, patiently endures tastes, patiently endures tactile objects, and it is endowed with strength. Possessing these six factors, a king's excellent thoroughbred horse is worthy of a king, an accessory of a king, and reckoned as a factor of kingship.

"So too, possessing six qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What six? Here, a bhikkhu patiently endures forms, patiently endures sounds, patiently endures odors, patiently endures tastes, patiently endures tactile objects, and patiently endures mental phenomena. Possessing these six qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

## 7 (7) Thoroughbred (3)

"Bhikkhus, possessing six factors, a king's excellent thoroughbred horse is worthy of a king, an accessory of a king, and reckoned as a factor of kingship. What six? Here, a king's excellent thoroughbred horse patiently endures forms, patiently endures sounds, patiently endures odors, patiently endures tastes, patiently endures tactile objects, and it is endowed with speed. [284] Possessing these six factors, a king's excellent thoroughbred horse is worthy of a king, an accessory of a king, and reckoned as a factor of kingship.

"So too, possessing six qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What six? Here, a bhikkhu patiently endures forms, patiently
endures sounds, patiently endures odors, patiently endures tastes, patiently endures tactile objects, and patiently endures mental phenomena. Possessing these six qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

# 8 (8) Unsurpassed Things

"Bhikkhus, there are these six unsurpassed things. What six? The unsurpassed sight, the unsurpassed hearing, the unsurpassed gain, the unsurpassed training, the unsurpassed service, and the unsurpassed recollection. These are the six unsurpassed things." ${ }^{1254}$

## 9 (9) Subjects of Recollection

"Bhikkhus, there are these six subjects of recollection. What six? Recollection of the Buddha, recollection of the Dhamma, recollection of the Sangha, recollection of virtuous behavior, recollection of generosity, and recollection of the deities. These are the six subjects of recollection." ${ }^{1255}$

## 10 (10) Mahānāma

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Park. Then Mahānāma the Sakyan approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to the Blessed One:

"Bhante, how does a noble disciple who has arrived at the fruit and understood the teaching often dwell?"1256

"Mahānāma, a noble disciple [285] who has arrived at the fruit and understood the teaching often dwells in this way: ${ }^{1257}$

(1) "Here, Mahānāma, a noble disciple recollects the Tathāgata thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' When a noble disciple recollects the Tathāgata, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight, based on the Tathāgata. A noble disciple whose mind is straight gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma,
gains joy connected with the Dhamma. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is called a noble disciple who dwells in balance amid an unbalanced population, ${ }^{1286}$ who dwells unafflicted amid an afflicted population. As one who has entered the stream of the Dhamma, ${ }^{1259}$ he develops recollection of the Buddha.

(2) "Again, Mahānāma, a noble disciple recollects the Dhamma thus: 'The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.' When a noble disciple recollects the Dhamma, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight, based on the Dhamma: A noble disciple whose mind is straight gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is called a noble disciple who dwells in balance amid an unbalanced population, who dwells unafflicted amid an afflicted population. [286] As one who has entered the stream of the Dhamma, he develops recollection of the Dhamma.

(3) "Again, Mahānāma, a noble disciple recollects the Sangha thus: 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is practicing the good way, practicing the straight way, practicing the true way, practicing the proper way; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals-this Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.' When a noble disciple recollects the Sangha, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight, based on the Sangha. A noble disciple whose mind is straight gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling
pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is called a noble disciple who dwells in balance amid an unbalanced population, who dwells unafflicted amid an afflicted population. As one who has entered the stream of the Dhamma, he develops recollection of the Sangha.

(4) "Again, Mahānāma, a noble disciple recollects his own virtuous behavior as unbroken, flawless; unblemished, unblotched, freeing, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading to concentration. When a noble disciple recollects his virtuous behavior, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight, based on virtuous behavior. A noble disciple whose mind is straight gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. [287] This is called a noble disciple who dwells in balance amid an unbalanced population, who dwells unafflicted amid an afflicted population. As one who has entered the stream of the Dhamma, he develops recollection of virtuous behavior.

(5) "Again, Mahānāma, a noble disciple recollects his own generosity thus: 'It is truly my good fortune and gain that in a population obsessed by the stain of miserliness, I dwell at home with a mind devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in relinquishment, devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing.' When a noble disciple recollects his generosity, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight, based on generosity. A noble disciple whose mind is straight gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is called a noble disciple who dwells in balance amid an unbalanced population, who dwells unafflicted amid an afflicted population. As one who has entered the stream of the Dhamma, he develops recollection of generosity.

(6) "Again, Mahānāma, a noble disciple recollects the deities
thus: 'There are devas [ruled by] the four great kings, Tāvatimsa devas, Yāma devas, Tusita devas, devas who delight in creation, devas who control what is created by others, devas of Brahmā's company, and devas still higher than these. ${ }^{1260}$ There exists in me too such faith as those deities possessed because of which, when they passed away here, they were reborn there; there exists in me too such virtuous behavior . . . such learning . . .such generosity . . .such wisdom as those deities possessed because of which, when they passed away here, they were reborn there.' When [288] a noble disciple recollects the faith, virtuous behavior, learning, generosity, and wisdom in himself and in those deities, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight, based on the deities. A noble disciple whose mind is straight gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is called a noble disciple who dwells in balance amid an unbalanced population, who dwells unafflicted amid an afflicted population. As one who has entered the stream of the Dhamma, he develops recollection of the deities.

"Mahānāma, a noble disciple who has arrived at the fruit and understood the teaching often dwells in just this way."

# II. Cordiality

## 11 (1) Cordiality (1)

"Bhikkhus, there are these six principles of cordiality. ${ }^{1261}$ What six?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu maintains bodily acts of loving-kindness toward his fellow monks both openly and privately. This is a principle of cordiality.

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu maintains verbal acts of loving-kindness toward his fellow monks both openly and privately. This, too, is a principle of cordiality.

(3) "Again, a bhikkhu maintains mental acts of lovingkindness toward his fellow monks both openly and privately. This, too, is a principle of cordiality. [289]
(4) "Again, a bhikkhu shares without reservation ${ }^{1263}$ any righteous gains that have been righteously obtained, including even the contents of his alms bowl, and uses such things in common with his virtuous fellow monks. This, too, is a principle of cordiality.

(5) "Again, a bhikkhu dwells both openly and privately possessing in common with his fellow monks virtuous behavior that is unbroken, flawless, unblemished, unblotched, freeing, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading to concentration. This, too, is a principle of cordiality.

(6) "Again, a bhikkhu dwells both openly and privately possessing in common with his fellow monks a view that is noble and emancipating, which leads out, for one who acts upon it, to the complete destruction of suffering. This, too, is a principle of cordiality.

"These, bhikkhus, are the six principles of cordiality."

# 12 (2) Cordiality (2)

"Bhikkhus, there are these six principles of cordiality that create affection and respect and conduce to cohesiveness; nondispute, concord, and unity. What six?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu maintains bodily acts of loving-kindness toward his fellow monks both openly and privately. This is a principle of cordiality that creates affection and respect and conduces to cohesiveness, non-dispute, concord, and unity.

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu maintains verbal acts of loving-kindness toward his fellow monks both openly and privately. This, too, is a principle of cordiality that creates affection and respect....

(5) "Again, a bhikkhu dwells both openly and privately possessing in common with his fellow monks virtuous behavior that is unbroken, flawless, unblemished, unblotched, free-

"These, bhikkhus, are the six principles of cordiality that create affection and respect and conduce to cohesiveness, to nondispute, to concord, and to unity."

# 13 (3) Escape

"Bhikkhus, there are these six elements of escape. ${ }^{1263}$ What six?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu might say thus: 'I have developed and cultivated the liberation of the mind by loving-kindness, made it my vehicle and basis, carried it out, consolidated it, and properly undertaken it, yet ill will still obsesses my mind.' He should be told: 'Not so! Do not speak thus. Do not misrepresent the Blessed One; for it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One would certainly not speak in such a way. It is impossible and inconceivable, friend, that one might develop and cultivate the liberation of the mind by loving-kindness, make it one's vehicle and basis, carry it out, consolidate it, and properly undertake it, yet [291] ill will could still obsess one's mind. There is no such possibility. For this, friend, is the escape from ill will, namely, the liberation of the mind by loving-kindness.'

(2) "Then, a bhikkhu might say thus: 'I have developed and cultivated the liberation of the mind by compassion, made it my vehicle and basis, carried it out, consolidated it, and properly undertaken it, yet the thought of harming still obsesses my mind.' He should be told: 'Not so! Do not speak thus. Do not misrepresent the Blessed One; for it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One would certainly not speak in such a way. It is impossible and inconceivable, friend, that one might develop and cultivate the liberation of the mind by compassion, make it one's vehicle and basis, carry it out, consolidate it, and properly undertake it, yet the thought of harming could
still obsess one's mind. There is no such possibility. For this, friend, is the escape from the thought of harming, namely, the liberation of the mind by compassion.'

(3) "Then, a bhikkhu might say thus: 'I have developed and cultivated the liberation of the mind by altruistic joy, made it my vehicle and basis, carried it out, consolidated it, and properly undertaken it, yet discontent still obsesses my mind. ${ }^{1264}$ He should be told: 'Not so! Do not speak thus. Do not misrepresent the Blessed One; for it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One would certainly not speak in such a way. It is impossible and inconceivable, friend, that one might develop and cultivate the liberation of the mind by altruistic joy, make it one's vehicle and basis, carry it out, consolidate it, and properly undertake it, yet discontent could still obsess one's mind. There is no such possibility. For this, friend, is the escape from discontent, namely, the liberation of the mind by altruistic joy.'

(4) "Then, a bhikkhu might say thus: 'I have developed and cultivated the liberation of the mind by equanimity, made it my vehicle and basis, carried it out, consolidated it, and properly undertaken it, yet lust still obsesses my mind.' He should be told: 'Not so! Do not speak thus. Do not misrepresent the Blessed One; for it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One would certainly not speak in such a way. It is impossible and inconceivable, friend, that one might develop and cultivate the liberation of the mind by equanimity, make it one's vehicle and basis, carry it out, consolidate it, and properly undertake it, [292] yet lust could still obsess one's mind. There is no such possibility. For this, friend, is the escape from lust, namely, the liberation of the mind by equanimity. ${ }^{1265}$

(5) "Then, a bhikkhu might say thus: 'I have developed and cultivated the markless liberation of the mind, ${ }^{1266}$ made it my vehicle and basis, carried it out, consolidated it, and properly undertaken it, yet my consciousness still follows after marks. ${ }^{1267}$ He should be told: 'Not so! Do not speak thus. Do not misrepresent the Blessed One; for it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One would certainly not speak in such a way. It is impossible and inconceivable, friend, that one might develop and cultivate the markless liberation of the mind, make it one's vehicle and basis, carry it out, consolidate
it, and properly undertake it, yet one's consciousness could still follow after marks. There is no such possibility. For this, friend, is the escape from all marks, namely, the markless liberation of the mind.'

(6) "Then, a bhikkhu might say: 'I have discarded [the notion] "I am," and I do not regard [anything as] "This I am," yet the dart of doubt and bewilderment still obsesses my mind.' He should be told: 'Not so! Do not speak thus. Do not misrepresent the Blessed One; for it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One would certainly not speak in such a way. It is impossible and inconceivable, friend, that when [the notion] "I am" has been discarded, and one does not regard [anything as] "This I am," the dart of doubt and bewilderment could still obsess one's mind. There is no such possibility. For this, friend, is the escape from the dart of doubt and bewilderment, namely, the uprooting of the conceit "I am." ${ }^{1268}$

"These, bhikkhus, are the six elements of escape."

# 14 (4) A Good Death

There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend!" those bhikkhus [293] replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:

"Friends, a bhikkhu passes his time ${ }^{1269}$ in such a way that he does not have a good death. ${ }^{1270}$ And how does a bhikkhu pass his time in such a way that he does not have a good death?

"Here, (1) a bhikkhu delights in work, takes delight in work, is devoted to delight in work; ${ }^{1271}$ (2) he delights in talk, takes delight in talk, is devoted to delight in talk; (3) he delights in sleep, takes delight in sleep, is devoted to delight in sleep; (4) he delights in company, takes delight in company, is devoted to delight in company; (5) he delights in bonding, takes delight in bonding, is devoted to delight in bonding; (6) he delights in proliferation, takes delight in proliferation, is devoted to delight in proliferation. ${ }^{1272}$ When a bhikkhu passes his time in such a way he does not have a good death. This is called a bhikkhu who delights in personal existence, ${ }^{1273}$ who has not abandoned personal existence to completely make an end of suffering.

"Friends, a bhikkhu passes his time in such a way that he has
a good death. And how does a bhikkhu pass his time in such a way that he has a good death?

"Here, (1) a bhikkhu does not delight in work, does not take delight in work, is not devoted to delight in work; (2) he does not delight in talk, does not take delight in talk, is not devoted to delight in talk; (3) he does not delight in sleep, does not take delight in sleep, is not devoted to delight in sleep; (4) he does not delight in company, does not take delight in company, is not devoted to delight in company; (5) he does not delight in bonding, does not take delight in bonding, is not devoted to delight in bonding; (6) he does not delight in proliferation, does not take delight in proliferation, is not devoted to delight in proliferation. When a bhikkhu [294] passes his time in such a way he has a good death. This is called a bhikkhu who delights in nibbāna, who has abandoned personal existence to completely make an end of suffering."

The creature ${ }^{1274}$ devoted to proliferation, who is delighted with proliferation, has failed to attain nibbāna, the unsurpassed security from bondage.

But one who has abandoned proliferation, who finds delight in non-proliferation, has attained nibbāna, the unsurpassed security from bondage.

# 15 (5) Regret

There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus....

"Friends, a bhikkhu passes his time in such a way that he dies with regret. And how does a bhikkhu pass his time in such a way that he dies with regret?

"Here, (1) a bhikkhu delights in work, takes delight in work, is devoted to delight in work ... [as in 6:14] ... (6) he delights in proliferation, takes delight in proliferation, is devoted to delight in proliferation. When a bhikkhu passes his time in such a way he dies with regret. This is called a bhikkhu who delights in personal existence, who has not abandoned personal existence to completely make an end of suffering.

"Friends, a bhikkhu passes his time in such a way that he dies
without regret. And how does a bhikkhu pass his time in such a way that he dies without regret?

"Here, (1) a bhikkhu does not delight in work, does not take delight in work, is not devoted to delight in work... [295]... (6) does not delight in proliferation, does not take delight in proliferation, is not devoted to delight in proliferation. When a bhikkhu passes his time in such a way he dies without regret. This is called a bhikkhu who delights in nibbāna, who has abandoned personal existence to completely make an end of suffering."

[The verses are identical with those of 6:14.]

# 16 (6) Nakula

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Bhaggas at Sumsumāragira, in the deer park at Bhesakalā Grove. Now on that occasion the householder Nakulapitā was sick, afflicted, gravely ill. Then the housewife Nakulamātā said this to him: "Do not die full of concern, ${ }^{1275}$ householder. To die full of concern is painful. To die full of concern has been criticized by the Blessed One. ${ }^{1276}$

(1) "It may be, householder, that you think thus: 'After I'm gone, Nakulamātā won't be able to support our children and maintain the household.' But you should not look at the matter in this way. I am skilled at weaving cotton and knitting wool. After you are gone, I'll be able to support the children [296] and maintain the household. Therefore, householder, do not die full of concern. To die full of concern is painful. To die full of concern has been criticized by the Blessed One.

(2) "It may be, householder, that you think thus: 'After I'm gone, Nakulamātā will take another husband. ${ }^{1277}$ But you should not look at the matter in this way. You know, householder, and so do I, that for the last sixteen years we have led the layperson's celibate life. ${ }^{1278}$ Therefore, householder, do not die full of concern. To die full of concern is painful. To die full of concern has been criticized by the Blessed One.

(3) "It may be, householder, that you think thus: 'After I'm gone, Nakulamātā won't want to see the Blessed One and the Sangha of bhikkhus.' But you should not look at the matter in this way. After you are gone, householder, I will be even keener to see the Blessed One and the Sangha of bhikkhus. Therefore, householder, do not die full of concern. To die full of concern is
painful. To die full of concern has been criticized by the Blessed One.

(4) "It may be, householder, that you think thus: Nakulamātā does not fulfill virtuous behavior. ${ }^{1279}$ But you should not look at the matter in this way. I am one of the Blessed One's whiterobed female lay disciples who fulfill virtuous behavior. If anyone has any doubt or uncertainty about this, the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One is dwelling among the Bhaggas at Sumsumāragira, in the deer park at Bhesakalā Grove. They can go and ask him. Therefore, householder, do not die full of concern. [297] To die full of concern is painful. To die full of concern has been criticized by the Blessed One.

(5) "It may be, householder, that you think thus: 'Nakulamātā does not obtain internal serenity of mind.' But you should not look at the matter in this way. I am one of the Blessed One's white-robed female lay disciples who obtain internal serenity of mind. If anyone has any doubt or uncertainty about this, the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One is dwelling among the Bhaggas at Sumsumāragira, in the deer park at Bhesakalā Grove. They can go and ask him. Therefore, householder, do not die full of concern. To die full of concern is painful. To die full of concern has been criticized by the Blessed One.

(6) "It may be, householder, that you think thus: 'Nakulamātā has not attained a foothold, a firm stand, assurance in this Dhamma and discipline; ${ }^{1280}$ she has not crossed over doubt, gotten rid of bewilderment, attained self-confidence, and become independent of others in the Teacher's teaching.' But you should not look at the matter in this way. I am one of the Blessed One's white-robed female lay disciples who have attained a foothold, a firm stand, assurance in this Dhamma and discipline; I am one of those who have crossed, over doubt, gotten rid of bewilderment, attained self-confidence, and become independent of others in the Teacher's teaching. If anyone has any doubt or uncertainty about this, the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One is dwelling among the Bhaggas at Sumsumāragira, in the deer park at Bhesakalā Grove. They can go and ask him. Therefore, householder, do not die full of concern. To die full of concern is painful. To die full of concern has been criticized by the Blessed One."

Then, while the householder Nakulapitā [298] was being exhorted in this way by the housewife Nakulamātā, his ailment subsided on the spot. Nakulapitā recovered from that illness, and that is how his illness was abandoned.

Then, not long after he had recovered, the householder Nakulapitā, leaning on a staff, approached the Blessed One. He paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:

"It is truly your good fortune and gain, householder, that the housewife Nakulamātā has compassion for you, desires your good, and exhorts and instructs you. Nakulamātā is one of my white-robed female lay disciples who fulfill virtuous behavior. She is one of my white-robed female lay disciples who obtain internal serenity of mind. She is one of my white-robed female lay disciples who have attained a foothold, a firm stand, assurance in this Dhamma and discipline, who have crossed over doubt, gotten rid of bewilderment, attained self-confidence, and become independent of others in the Teacher's teaching. It is truly your good fortune and gain, householder, that the housewife Nakulamātā has compassion for you, desires your good, and exhorts and instructs you."

# 17 (7) Wholesome

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and went to the meeting hall, where he sat down in the seat that was prepared. In the evening, the Venerable Sāriputta, too, emerged from seclusion and went to the meeting hall, where [299] he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna . . . the Venerable Mahākassapa . . . the Venerable Mahākaccāyana . . . the Venerable Mahākotṭhita . . . the Venerable Mahācunda . . . the Venerable Mahākappina . . . the Venerable Anuruddha . . . the Venerable Revata . . . the Venerable Ānanda, too, emerged from seclusion and went to the meeting hall, where he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side.

Then, having passed most of the night sitting, the Blessed One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. Soon after the Blessed One had left, those venerable ones, too, got up from
their seats and went to their own dwellings. But those bhikkhus who were newly ordained, who had not long gone forth and had just recently come to this Dhamma and discipline, slept, snoring away until sunrise. With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, the Blessed One saw those bhikkhus asleep, snoring away until sunrise. He then went to the meeting hall, sat down in the seat prepared for him, and addressed those bhikkhús:

"Bhikkhus, where is Sāriputta? Where is Mahāmoggallāna? Where is Mahākassapa? Where is Mahākaccāyana? Where is Mahākotṭhita? Where is Mahācunda? Where is Mahākappina? Where is Anuruddha? Where is Revata? Where is Ānanda? Where have those elder disciples gone?"

"Bhante, not long after the Blessed One left, those venerable ones, too, got up from their seats and went to their own dwellings."

"Bhikkhus, when the elder bhikkhus left, why did you newly ordained ones sleep, snoring away until sunrise?

(1) "What do you think, bhikkhus? Have you ever seen or heard that a head-anointed khattiya king, while exercising rule all his life, is pleasing and agreeable to the country [300] if he spends as much time as he wants yielding to the pleasure of rest, the pleasure of sloth, the pleasure of sleep?"1281

"No, Bhante."

"Good, bhikkhus. I too have never seen or heard of such a thing.

(2) "What do you think, bhikkhus? Have you ever seen or heard that a royal official... (3) ... a favorite son... (4) ... a general ... (5) ... a village headman ... (6) ... a guild master, while exercising leadership over the guild all his life, is pleasing and agreeable to the guild if he spends as much time as he wants yielding to the pleasure of rest, the pleasure of sloth, the pleasure of sleep?"

"No, Bhante."

"Good, bhikkhus. I too have never seen or heard of such a thing.

"Bhikkhus, what do you think? Suppose there is an ascetic or brahmin who spends as much time as he wants yielding to the pleasure of rest, the pleasure of sloth, the pleasure of sleep; one who does not guard the doors of the sense faculties, who
is immoderate in eating, and is not intent on wakefulness; who lacks insight into wholesome qualities; who does not dwell intent on the endeavor to develop the aids to enlightenment in the earlier and later phases of the night. Have you ever seen or heard that such a one, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it?"

"No, Bhante."

"Good, bhikkhus. I too have never seen or [301] heard of such a thing.

"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will guard the doors of the sense faculties, be moderate in eating, and be intent on wakefulness; we will have insight into wholesome qualities, and will dwell intent on the endeavor to develop the aids to enlightenment in the earlier and later phases of the night. ${ }^{1282}$ Thus, bhikkhus, should you train yourselves."

# 18 (8) The Fish Dealer

On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Sangha of bhikkhus. Then, while traveling along the highway, in a certain spot the Blessed One saw a fish dealer killing fish and selling them. He left the highway, sat down on a seat that was prepared for him at the foot of a tree, and addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, do you see that fish dealer killing fish and selling them?"

"Yes, Bhante:"

(1) "What do you think, bhikkhus? Have you ever seen or heard that a fish dealer, killing fish [302] and selling them, might, by means of this work and livelihood, travel around by elephant or horse, by chariot or vehicle, or enjoy wealth or live off a large accumulation of wealth?"

"No, Bhante."

"Good, bhikkhus. I too have never seen or heard of such a thing. For what reason? Because he looks on cruelly at the captive fish as they are brought for slaughter. Therefore he does not travel around by elephant or horse, by chariot or vehicle, or enjoy wealth or live off a large accumulation of wealth.

(2) "What do you think, bhikkhus? Have you ever seen or heard that a cattle butcher, killing cows and selling them ... [303]
(3) ... a butcher of sheep ... (4) ... a butcher of pigs ... (5) ... a butcher of poultry ... (6) ... a butcher of deer, killing deer and selling them, might, by means of that work and livelihood, travel around by elephant or horse, by chariot or vehicle, or enjoy wealth or live off a large accumulation of wealth?"

"No, Bhante."

"Good, bhikkhus. I too have never seen or heard of such a thing. For what reason? Because he looks on cruelly at the captive deer as they are brought for slaughter. Therefore he does not travel around by elephant or horse, by chariot or vehicle, or enjoy wealth or live off a large accumulation of wealth.

"Bhikkhus, one who looks on cruelly at captive animals as they are brought for slaughter will not travel around by elephant or horse, by chariot or vehicle, or enjoy wealth or live off a large accumulation of wealth. What then can be said about one who looks on cruelly at a condemned human being brought up for slaughter? This will lead to his harm and suffering for a long time. With the breakup of the body after death, he will be reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell."

# 19 (9) Mindfulness of Death (1)

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Nādika in the brick hall. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: [304] "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, mindfulness of death, when developed and cultivated, is of great fruit and benefit, culminating in the deathless, having the deathless as its consummation. ${ }^{1283}$ But do you, bhikkhus, develop mindfulness of death?"

(1) When this was said, one bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, I develop mindfulness of death."

"But how, bhikkhu, do you develop mindfulness of death?"

"Here, Bhante, I think thus: 'May I live just a night and a day so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching. ${ }^{1284}$ I could then accomplish much! ${ }^{1285}$ It is in this way that I develop mindfulness of death."

(2) Another bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "I too, Bhante, develop mindfulness of death."
"But how, bhikkhu, do you develop mindfulness of death?"

"Here, Bhante, I think: 'May I live just a day so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching. I could then accomplish much!' It is in this way that I develop mindfulness of death."

(3) Still another bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "I too, Bhante, develop mindfulness of death."

"But how, bhikkhu, do you develop mindfulness of death?"

"Here, Bhante, I think: 'May I live just the length of time it takes to eat a single alms meal ${ }^{1286}$ so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching. I could then accomplish much!' It is in this way that I develop mindfulness of death."

(4) Still another bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "I too, Bhante, develop mindfulness of death."

"But how, bhikkhu, do you develop mindfulness of death?"

"Here, Bhante, I think: 'May I live just the length of time it takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls of food so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching. [305] I could then accomplish much!' It is in this way that I develop mindfulness of death."

(5) Still another bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "I too, Bhante, develop mindfulness of death."

"But how, bhikkhu, do you develop mindfulness of death?"

"Here, Bhante, I think: 'May I live just the length of time it takes to chew and swallow a single mouthful of food so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching. I could then accomplish much!' It is in this way that I develop mindfulness of death."

(6) Still another bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "I too, Bhante, develop mindfulness of death."

"But how, bhikkhu, do you develop mindfulness of death?"

"Here, Bhante, I think: 'May I live just the length of time it takes to breathe out after breathing in, or to breathe in after breathing out, so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching. I could then accomplish much!' It is in this way that I develop mindfulness of death."

When this was said, the Blessed One said to those bhikkhus:
"Bhikkhus, (1) the bhikkhu who develops mindfulness of death thus: 'May I live just a night and a day so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching. I could then accomplish much!'; and (2) the one who develops mindfulness of death thus: 'May I live just a day so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching. I could then accomplish much!'; and (3) the one who develops mindfulness of death thus: 'May I live just the length of time it takes to eat a single alms meal so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching. I could then accomplish much!'; and (4) the one who develops mindfulness of death thus: 'May I live just the length of time it takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls of food so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching. I could then accomplish much!': [306] these are called bhikkhus who dwell heedlessly. They develop mindfulness of death sluggishly for the destruction of the taints.

"But (5) the bhikkhu who develops mindfulness of death thus: 'May I live just the length of time it takes to chew and swallow a single mouthful of food so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching. I could then accomplish much!'; and (6) the one who develops mindfulness of death thus: 'May I live just the length of time it takes to breathe out after breathing in, or to breathe in after breathing out, so that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching. I could then accomplish much!': these are called bhikkhus who dwell heedfully. They develop mindfulness of death keenly for the destruction of the taints.

"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will dwell heedfully. We will develop mindfulness of death keenly for the destruction of the taints.' Thus should you train yourselves."

# 20 (10) Mindfulness of Death (2)

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Nädika in the brick hall. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:

"Bhikkhus, mindfulness of death, when developed and cultivated, is of great fruit and benefit, culminating in the deathless, having the deathless as its consummation. And how is this so?

"Here, bhikkhus, when day has receded and night has approached, ${ }^{1267}$ a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'I could die on account of many causes. (1) A snake might bite me, or a scorpion or
centipede might sting me, and I might die; that would be an obstacle for me. (2) I might stumble and fall down, or (3) my food might disagree with me, or (4) my bile [307] might become agitated, or (5) my phlegm might become agitated, or (6) sharp winds in me might become agitated, and I might die; that would be an obstacle for me.'

"This bhikkhu should reflect thus: 'Do I have any bad unwholesome qualities that have not been abandoned, which might become an obstacle for me if I were to die tonight?' If, upon review, the bhikkhu knows: 'I have bad unwholesome qualities that have not been abandoned, which might become an obstacle for me if I were to die tonight,' then he should put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to abandon those bad unwholesome qualities. Just as one whose clothes or head had caught fire would put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to extinguish [the fire on] his clothes or head, so that bhikkhu should put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to abandon those bad unwholesome qualities.

"But if, upon review, the bhikkhu knows thus: 'I do not have any bad unwholesome qualities that have not been abandoned, which might become an obstacle for me if I were to die tonight,' then he should dwell in that same rapture and joy, training day and night in wholesome qualities.

"But when night has receded and day has approached, a bhikkhu reflects thus: 'I could die on account of many causes. A snake might bite me . . . or sharp winds might become agitated in me, and I might die; that would be an obstacle for me.'

"This bhikkhu should reflect thus: [308] 'Do I have any bad unwholesome qualities that have not been abandoned which might become an obstacle for me if I were to die this day?' If, upon review, the bhikkhu knows: 'I have bad unwholesome qualities that I have not yet abandoned, which might become an obstacle for me if I were to die this day,' then he should put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to abandon those bad unwholesome qualities. Just as one whose clothes or head had caught fire would put forth extraordinary desire,
effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to extinguish [the fire on] his clothes or head, so that bhikkhu should put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to abandon those bad unwholesome qualities.

"But if, upon review, the bhikkhu knows: 'I do not have any bad unwholesome qualities that I have not yet abandoned, which might become an obstacle for me if I were to die this day,' then he should dwell in that same rapture and joy, training day and night in wholesome qualities.

"It is, bhikkhus, when mindfulness of death is developed and cultivated in this way that it is of great fruit and benefit, culminating in the deathless, having the deathless as its consummation." [309]

# III. The UnSURPASSED Things

## 21 (1) Sāmaka

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Sāmagāmaka near the lotus pond. Then, when the night had advanced, a certain deity of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire lotus pond, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and said to the Blessed One:

"Bhante, there are these three qualities that lead to the decline of a bhikkhu. What three? (1) Delight in work, (2) delight in talk, and (3) delight in sleep. These are the three qualities that lead to the decline of a bhikkhu."

This is what that deity said. The Teacher agreed. Then that deity, thinking, "The Teacher agrees with me," paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and disappeared right there.

Then, when the night had passed, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Last night, bhikkhus, when the night had advanced, a certain deity of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire lotus pond, approached me, paid homage to me, stood to one side, and said to me: 'Bhante, there are these three qualities that lead to the decline of a bhikkhu. What three? Delight in work, delight in talk, and delight in sleep. These are the three qualities that lead to the decline of a bhikkhu.' This is what
that deity said. Having said this, that deity paid homage to me, circumambulated me keeping the right side toward me, and disappeared right there.

"It is, bhikkhus, a misfortune and loss for those of you whom even the deities know are declining in wholesome qualities. ${ }^{1288}$

"I will teach, bhikkhus, another three qualities that lead to decline. Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied.

The Blessed One said this: [310] "And what, bhikkhus, are the three [other] qualities that lead to decline? (4) Delight in company, (5) being difficult to correct, and (6) bad friendship. Those are the three [other] qualities that lead to decline.

"Bhikkhus, all those in the past who declined in wholesome qualities declined because of these six qualities. All those in the future who will decline in wholesome qualities will decline because of these six qualities. And all those at present who are declining in wholesome qualities are declining because of these six qualities."

# 22 (2) Non-Decline

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you these six qualities that lead to nondecline. Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"And what, bhikkhus, are the six qualities that lead to nondecline? Not taking delight in work, not taking delight in talk, not taking delight in sleep, not taking delight in company, being easy to correct, and good friendship. These are the six qualities that lead to non-decline.

"Bhikkhus, all those in the past who did not decline in wholesome qualities did not decline because of these six qualities. All those in the future who will not decline in wholesome qualities will not decline because of these six qualities. And all those at present who are not declining in wholesome qualities are not declining because of these six qualities."

## 23 (3) Peril

(1) "Bhikkhus, 'peril' is a designation for sensual pleasures. (2) 'Suffering' is a designation for sensual pleasures. (3) 'Disease' is a designation for sensual pleasures. (4) 'Boil' [311] is a
designation for sensual pleasures. (5) 'Tie' is a designation for sensual pleasures. (6) 'Swamp' is a designation for sensual pleasures.

"And why, bhikkhus, is 'peril' a designation for sensual pleasures? One excited by sensual lust, bound by desire and lust, is not freed from the perils pertaining to the present life or from the perils pertaining to future lives; therefore 'peril' is a designation for sensual pleasures.

"And why is 'suffering'... 'disease'... 'boil'... 'tie'... 'swamp' a designation for sensual pleasures? One excited by sensual lust, bound by desire and lust, is not freed from the swamps pertaining to the present life or from the swamps pertaining to future lives; therefore 'swamp' is a designation for sensual pleasures."

Peril, suffering, and disease, a boil, a tie, and a swamp: these describe the sensual pleasures to which the worldling is attached.

Having seen the peril in clinging as the origin of birth and death, being liberated by non-clinging in the extinction of birth and death, those happy ones have attained security; they have reached nibbāna in this very life.

Having overcome all enmity and peril, they have transcended all suffering. ${ }^{1289}$

# 24 (4) Himalayas

"Bhikkhus, possessing six qualities, a bhikkhu might split the Himalayas, the king of mountains, ${ }^{1290}$ how much more then vile ignorance! What six? Here, a bhikkhu is (1) skilled in the attainment of concentration; (2) skilled in the duration of concentration; (3) skilled in emergence from concentration; (4) skilled in fitness for concentration; (5) skilled in the area of concentration; and (6) skilled in resolution regarding concentration. ${ }^{1291}$ [312] Possessing these six qualities, a bhikkhu might split the Himalayas, the king of mountains, how much more then vile ignorance!"

25 (5) Recollection

"Bhikkhus, there are these six subjects of recollection. ${ }^{1292}$ What six?

(1) "Here, bhikkhus, a noble disciple recollects the Tathāgata thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' When a noble disciple recollects the Tathāgata, on that occasion his mind is not.obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight. He has departed from greed, freed himself from it, emerged from it. 'Greed,' bhikkhus, is a designation for the five objects of sensual pleasure. Having made this a basis, ${ }^{1293}$ some beings here are purified in such a way.

(2) "Again, a noble disciple recollects the Dhamma thus: 'The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.' When a noble disciple recollects the Dhamma, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight. He has departed from greed ... some beings here are purified in such a way.

(3) "Again, a noble disciple recollects the Sangha thus: 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is practicing the good way, practicing the straight way, practicing the true way, practicing the proper way; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals-this Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.' When [313] a noble disciple recollects the Sangha, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight. He has departed from greed ... some beings here are purified in such a way.

(4) "Again, a noble disciple recollects his own virtuous behavior as unbroken, flawless, unblemished, unblotched, freeing, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading to concentration. When a noble disciple recollects his virtuous behavior, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on
that occasion his mind is simply straight. He has departed from greed . . . some beings here are purified in such a way.

(5) "Again, a noble disciple recollects his own generosity thus: 'It is truly my good fortune and gain that in a population obsessed by the stain of miserliness, I dwell with a mind devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in relinquishment, devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing.' When a noble disciple recollects his generosity, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight. He has departed from greed . . . some beings here are purified in such a way.

(6) "Again, a noble disciple recollects the deities thus: 'There are devas [ruled by] the four great kings, Tāvatimsa devas, Yāma devas, Tusita devas, devas who delight in creation, devas who control what is created by others, devas [314] of Brahmā's company, and devas still higher than these. I too have such faith as those deities possessed, because of which, when they passed away here, they were reborn there; I too have such virtuous behavior...such learning . . .such generosity . . .such wisdom as those deities possessed, because of which, when they passed away here, they were reborn there.' When a noble disciple recollects the faith, virtuous behavior, learning, generosity, and wisdom in himself and in those deities, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight. He has departed from greed, freed himself from it, emerged from it. 'Greed,' bhikkhus, is a designation for the five objects of sensual pleasure. Having made this a basis, too, some beings here are purified in such a way.

"These, bhikkhus, are the six subjects of recollection."

# 26 (6) Kaccāna

There the Venerable Mahākaccāna addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend!" those bhikkhus replied.

The Venerable Mahākaccāna said this:

"It's astounding and amazing, friends, that the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, who knows and sees, has discovered the opening in the midst of confinement
for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and dejection, for the achievement of the method, for the realization of nibbāna, that is, the six subjects of recollection. ${ }^{1294}$ What six?

(1) "Here, friends, a noble disciple recollects the Tathāgata thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant . . . the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' When a noble disciple recollects the Tathāgata, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, [315] or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight. He has departed from greed, freed himself from it, emerged from it. 'Greed,' friends, is a designation for the five objects of sensual pleasure. This noble disciple dwells with a mind entirely like space: vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity and ill will. Having made this a basis, some beings here become pure in such a way. ${ }^{1295}$

(2) "Again, a noble disciple recollects the Dhamma thus: "The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One . . . to be personally experienced by the wise.' When a noble disciple recollects the Dhamma, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight. He has departed from greed . . . some beings here become pure in such a way.

(3) "Again, a noble disciple recollects the Sangha thus: 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is practicing the good way... the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.' When a noble disciple recollects the Sangha, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight. He has departed from greed ...

He has departed from greed ... some beings here become pure in such a way.

He has departed from greed, freed himself from it, emerged from it. 'Greed,' friends, is a designation for the five objects of sensual pleasure.

# 27 (7) Occasion (1)

Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: "Bhante, how many proper occasions are there for going to see an esteemed bhikkhu? ${ }^{\text {P1296 }}$

"There are, bhikkhu, these six proper occasions for going to see an esteemed bhikkhu. What six?

(1) "Here, bhikkhu, when a bhikkhu's mind is obsessed and oppressed by sensual lust, and he does not understand as it really is the escape from arisen sensual lust, on that occasion he should approach an esteemed bhikkhu and say to him: 'Friend, my mind is obsessed and oppressed by sensual lust, [318] and I
do not understand as it really is the escape from arisen sensual lust. Please teach me the Dhamma for abandoning sensual lust.' The esteemed bhikkhu then teaches him the Dhamma for abandoning sensual lust. This is the first proper occasion for going to see an esteemed bhikkhu.

(2) "Again, when a bhikkhu's mind is obsessed and oppressed by ill will, and he does not understand as it really is the escape from arisen ill will, on that occasion he should approach an esteemed bhikkhu and say to him: 'Friend, my mind is obsessed and oppressed by ill will....' The esteemed bhikkhu then teaches him the Dhamma for abandoning ill will. This is the second proper occasion for going to see an esteemed bhikkhu.

(3) "Again, when a bhikkhu's mind is obsessed and oppressed by dullness and drowsiness, and he does not understand as it really is the escape from arisen dullness and drowsiness, on that occasion he should approach an esteemed bhikkhu and say to him: 'Friend, my mind is obsessed and oppressed by dullness and drowsiness....' The esteemed bhikkhu then teaches him the Dhamma for abandoning dullness and drowsiness. This is the third proper occasion for going to see an esteemed bhikkhu.

(4) "Again, when a bhikkhu's mind is obsessed and oppressed by restlessness and remorse, and he does not understand as it really is the escape from arisen restlessness and remorse, on that occasion he should approach an esteemed bhikkhu and say to him: 'Friend, my mind is obsessed and oppressed by restlessness and remorse....' [319]... The esteemed bhikkhu then teaches him the Dhamma for abandoning restlessness and remorse. This is the fourth proper occasion for going to see an esteemed bhikkhu.

(5) "Again, when a bhikkhu's mind is obsessed and oppressed by doubt, and he does not understand as it really is the escape from arisen doubt, on that occasion he should approach an esteemed bhikkhu and say to him: 'Friend, my mind is obsessed and oppressed by doubt, and I do not understand as it really is the escape from arisen doubt. Please teach me the Dhamma for abandoning doubt.' The esteemed bhikkhu then teaches him the Dhamma for abandoning doubt. This is the fifth proper occasion for going to see an esteemed bhikkhu.

(6) "Again, when a bhikkhu does not know and see what
object to rely on and attend to in order to attain the immediate destruction of the taints, ${ }^{1297}$ on that occasion he should approach an esteemed bhikkhu and say to him: 'Friend, I do not know and see what object to rely on and attend to in order to attain the immediate destruction of the taints. Please teach me the Dhamma for the destruction of the taints.' The esteemed bhikkhu then teaches him the Dhamma for the destruction of the taints. This is the sixth proper occasion for going to see an esteemed bhikkhu.

"These, bhikkhu, are the six proper occasions for going to see an esteemed bhikkhu." [320]

# 28 (8) Occasion (2)

On one occasion a number of elder bhikkhus were dwelling at Bārānasī in the deer park at Isipatana. Then, after their meal, on returning from their alms round, those elder bhikkhus assembled and were sitting together in the pavilion hall when this conversation arose among them; "What, friends, is the proper occasion for going to see an esteemed bhikkhu?"

When this was said, one bhikkhu told those elders: "Friends, after his meal, when an esteemed bhikkhu has returned from his alms round, washed his feet, and is sitting with his legs crossed, holding his body straight, having established mindfulness before him: that is the proper occasion for going to see him."

When he had spoken, another bhikkhu told him: "Friend, that isn't the proper occasion for going to see an esteemed bhikkhu. After his meal, when an esteemed bhikkhu has returned from his alms round, washed his feet, and is sitting with his legs crossed, holding his body straight, having established mindfulness before him, his fatigue on account of his walking [for alms] and his meal has not yet subsided. Therefore that is not the proper occasion for going to see him. But in the evening, when an esteemed bhikkhu has emerged from seclusion and is sitting in the shade of his dwelling with his legs crossed, holding his body straight, having established mindfulness before him: that is the proper occasion for going to see him."

When he had spoken, another bhikkhu told him: "Friend, that isn't the proper occasion for going to see an esteemed bhikkhu. [321] In the evening, when an esteemed bhikkhu has emerged
from seclusion and is sitting in the shade of his dwelling with his legs crossed, holding his body straight, having established mindfulness before him, the object of concentration that he attended to during the day is still present to him. ${ }^{1298}$ Therefore that is not the proper occasion for going to see him. But when an esteemed bhikkhu has risen as the night begins to fade and is sitting with his legs crossed, holding his body straight, having established mindfulness before him: that is the proper occasion for going to see him."

When he had spoken, another bhikkhu told him: "Friend, that isn't the proper occasion for going to see an esteemed bhikkhu. When an esteemed bhikkhu has risen as the night begins to fade and he is sitting with his legs crossed, holding his body straight, having established mindfulness before him, on that occasion his body is fresh; it is easy for him to attend to the teaching of the Buddhas. Therefore that is not the proper occasion for going to see him."

When this was said, the Venerable Mahākaccāna said to those elder bhikkhus: "Friends, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learned this:

"There are, bhikkhu, these six proper occasions for going to see an esteemed bhikkhu. What six? (1) Here, bhikkhu, when a bhikkhu's mind is obsessed and oppressed by sensual lust... [as in 6:27] [322] ... (2) . . obsessed and oppressed by ill will... (3) ... obsessed and oppressed by dullness and drowsiness... (4) ... obsessed and oppressed by restlessness and remorse ... (5) ... obsessed and oppressed by doubt ... (6) ... when a bhikkhu does not know and see what object to rely on and attend to in order to attain the immediate destruction of the taints.... The esteemed bhikkhu then teaches him the Dhamma for the destruction of the taints. This is the sixth proper occasion for going to see an esteemed bhikkhu.'

"Friends, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learned this: 'These, bhikkhu, are the six proper occasions for going to see an esteemed bhikkhu.'"

# 29 (9) Udāyī

Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Udāyī: "Udāyī, how many subjects of recollection are there?"

When this was said, the Venerable Udāyī was silent. A second
time . . A third time the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Udāyī: "Udāyī, how many subjects of recollection are there?" And a third time the Venerable Udāyī was silent.

Then the Venerable Ānanda said to the Venerable Udāyī: "The Teacher is addressing you, friend Udāyī."

"I heard him, friend Ānanda. [323]

"Here, Bhante, a bhikkhu recollects his manifold past abodes, that is, one birth, two births... [as in 6:2]... Thus he recollects his manifold past abodes with their aspects and details. This, Bhante, is a subject of recollection."

Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ānanda: "I knew, Ānanda, that this hollow man Udāyī does not devote himself to the higher mind. ${ }^{1299}$ How many subjects of recollection are there, Ānanda?"

"There are, Bhante, five subjects of recollection. What five?

(1) "Here, Bhante, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. With the subsiding of thought and examination, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration, without thought and examination. With the fading away as well of rapture, he dwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, he experiences pleasure with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: 'He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.' This subject of recollection, developed and cultivated in this way, leads to a happy dwelling in this very life. ${ }^{1300}$

(2) "Again, Bhante, a bhikkhu attends to the perception of light; he focuses on the perception of day thus: 'As by day, so at night; as at night, so by day.' Thus, with a mind that is open and uncovered, he develops a mind imbued with luminosity. ${ }^{1301}$ This subject of recollection, developed and cultivated in this way, leads to obtaining knowledge and vision.

(3) "Again, Bhante, a bhikkhu reviews this very body upward from the soles of the feet, downward from the tips of the hairs, enclosed in skin, as full of many kinds of impurities: 'There are in this body head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen,
lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach, excrement, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, fluid of the joints, urine.' This subject of recollection, developed and cultivated in this way, leads to abandoning sensual lust.

(4) "Again, Bhante, suppose a bhikkhu were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground, one, two, [324] or three days dead, bloated, livid, and festering. He compares his own body with it thus: 'This body, too, is of the same nature; it will be like that; it is not beyond that. ${ }^{1302}$ Or suppose he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground, being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, dogs, jackals, or various kinds of living beings. He compares his own body with it thus: 'This body, too, is of the same nature; it will be like that; it is not beyond that.' Or suppose he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground, a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together with sinews . . . a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood, held together with sinews . . . a skeleton without flesh and blood, held together with sinews . . . disconnected bones scattered in all directions: here a handbone, there a footbone, here a shinbone, there a thighbone, here a hipbone, there a backbone, and there the skull. He compares his own body with it thus: 'This body, too, is of the same nature; it will be like that; it is not beyond that.' Or suppose he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground, bones bleached white, the color of shells...bones heaped up, more than a year old . . . bones rotted, crumbled to dust. He compares his own body with it thus: [325] 'This body, too, is of the same nature; it will be like that; it is not beyond that.' This subject of recollection, developed and cultivated in this way, leads to the uprooting of the conceit 'I am.'

(5) "Again, Bhante, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity. This subject of recollection, developed and cultivated in this way, leads to the penetration of numerous elements. ${ }^{1303}$

"These, Bhante, are the five subjects of recollection."

"Good, good, Ānanda! Therefore, Ānanda, remember this sixth subject of recollection, too.

(6) "Here, ever mindful a bhikkhu goes forward, ever mindful he returns, ever mindful he stands, ever mindful he sits,
ever mindful he lies down to sleep, ever mindful he undertakes work. This subject of recollection, developed and cultivated in this way, leads to mindfulness and clear comprehension."

# 30 (10) Unsurpassed Things

"Bhikkhus, there are these six unsurpassed things. What six? (1) The unsurpassed sight, (2) the unsurpassed hearing, (3) the unsurpassed gain, (4) the unsurpassed training, (5) the unsurpassed service, and (6) the unsurpassed recollection. ${ }^{1304}$

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the unsurpassed sight? Here, someone goes to see the elephant-gem, the horse-gem, the jewel-gem, or to see various sights; or else they go to see an ascetic or brahmin of wrong views, of wrong practice. There is this seeing; this I do not deny. But this seeing is low, common, worldly, ignoble, and unbeneficial; it does not lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, peace, direct knowledge, enlightenment, and [326] nibbāna. When, however, one of settled faith, of settled devotion, decided, full of confidence, goes to see the Tathāgata or a disciple of the Tathāgata: this unsurpassed sight is for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and dejection, for the achievement of the method, for the realization of nibbāna. This is called the unsurpassed sight. Such is the unsurpassed sight.

(2) "And how is there the unsurpassed hearing? Here, someone goes to hear the sound of drums, the sound of lutes, the sound of singing, or to hear various sounds; or else they go to hear the Dhamma of an ascetic or brahmin of wrong views, of wrong practice. There is this hearing; this I do not deny. But this hearing is low, common, worldly, ignoble, and unbeneficial; it does not lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, peace, direct knowledge, enlightenment, and nibbāna. When, however, one of settled faith, of settled devotion, decided, full of confidence, goes to hear the Tathāgata or a disciple of the Tathāgata: this unsurpassed hearing is for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and dejection, for the achievement of the method, for the realization of nibbāna. This is called the unsurpassed hearing. Such is the unsurpassed sight and the unsurpassed hearing.
(3) "And how is there the unsurpassed gain? Here, someone gains a son, a wife, or wealth; or they gain various [327] goods; or else they obtain faith in an ascetic or brahmin of wrong views, of wrong practice. There is this gain; this I do not deny. But this gain is low, common, worldly, ignoble, and unbeneficial; it does not lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, peace, direct knowledge, enlightenment, and nibbāna. When, however, one of settled faith, of settled devotion, decided, full of confidence, obtains faith in the Tathāgata or in a disciple of the Tathāgata: this unsurpassed gain is for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and dejection, for the achievement of the method, for the realization of nibbāna. This is called the unsurpassed gain. Such is the unsurpassed sight, the unsurpassed hearing, and the unsurpassed gain.

(4) "And how is there the unsurpassed training? Here, someone trains in elephantry, in horsemanship, in chariotry, in archery, in swordsmanship; or they train in various fields; or else they train under an ascetic or brahmin of wrong views, of wrong practice. There is this training; this I do not deny. But this training is low, common, worldly, ignoble, and unbeneficial; it does not lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, peace, direct knowledge, enlightenment, and nibbāna. When, however, one of settled faith, of settled devotion, decided, full of confidence, trains in the higher virtuous behavior, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata: this unsurpassed training is for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and dejection, for the achievement of the method, for the [328] realization of nibbāna. This is called the unsurpassed training. Such is the unsurpassed sight, the unsurpassed hearing, the unsurpassed gain, and the unsurpassed training.

(5) "And how is there the unsurpassed service? Here, someone serves a khattiya, a brahmin, a householder; or they serve various others; or else they serve an ascetic or brahmin of wrong views, of wrong practice. There is this kind of service; this I do not deny. But this kind of service is low, common, worldly, ignoble, and unbeneficial; it does not lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, peace, direct knowledge, enlightenment,
and nibbāna. When, however, one of settled faith, of settled devotion, decided, full of confidence, serves the Tathāgata or a disciple of the Tathāgata: this unsurpassed service is for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and dejection, for the achievement of the method, for the realization of nibbāna. This is called the unsurpassed service. Thus there is the unsurpassed sight, the unsurpassed hearing, the unsurpassed gain, the unsurpassed training, and the unsurpassed service.

(6) "And how is there the unsurpassed recollection? Here, someone recollects the gain of a son, a wife, or wealth; or else they recollect various kinds of gain; or else they recollect an ascetic or brahmin of wrong views, of wrong practice. There is this kind of recollection; this I do not deny. But this kind of recollection is low, common, worldly, ignoble, and unbeneficial; it does not lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, peace, direct knowledge, enlightenment, and nibbāna. When, however, one [329] of settled faith, of settled devotion, decided, full of confidence, recollects the Tathāgata or a disciple of the Tathāgata: this unsurpassed recollection is for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and dejection, for the achievement of the method, for the realization of nibbāna. This is called the unsurpassed recollection.

"These, bhikkhus, are the six unsurpassed things."

Having gained the best of sights, and the unsurpassed hearing, having acquired the unsurpassed gain, delighting in the unsurpassed training, attentive in service, they develop recollection connected with seclusion, secure, leading to the deathless.

Rejoicing in heedfulness, prudent, restrained by virtue, in time they realize where it is that suffering ceases.

# IV. Deities

## 31 (1) Trainee

"Bhikkhus, these six qualities lead to the decline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee. What six? [330] Delight in work, delight in talk, delight in sleep, delight in company, not guarding the doors of the sense faculties, and lack of moderation in eating. These six qualities lead to the decline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee.

"Bhikkhus, these six qualities lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee. What six? Not taking delight in work, not taking delight in talk, not taking delight in sleep, not taking delight in company, guarding the doors of the sense faculties, and moderation in eating. These six qualities lead to the nondecline of a bhikkhu who is a trainee."

## 32 (2) Non-Decline (1)

Then, when the night had advanced, a certain deity of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta's Grove, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and said to the Blessed One:

"Bhante, there are these six qualities that lead to the nondecline of a bhikkhu. What six? Reverence for the Teacher, reverence for the Dhamma, reverence for the Sangha, reverence for the training, reverence for heedfulness, and reverence for hospitality. ${ }^{1305}$ These six qualities lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu."

This is what that deity said. The Teacher agreed. Then that deity, thinking, "The Teacher agrees with me," paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and disappeared right there.

Then, when the night had passed, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Last night, bhikkhus, when the night had advanced, a certain deity of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta's Grove, approached me, paid homage to me, stood to one side, and said to me: 'Bhante, there are these six qualities that lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu. What six? Reverence for the Teacher, reverence for the Dhamma, reverence for the Sangha, reverence for the training, reverence for heedfulness, and reverence for hospitality. [331] These six qualities lead to
the non-decline of a bhikkhu.' This is what that deity said. Then that deity paid homage to me, circumambulated me keeping the right side toward me, and disappeared right there."

Respectful toward the Teacher, respectful toward the Dhamma, deeply revering the Sangha, respectful toward heedfulness, revering hospitality: this bhikkhu cannot fall away, but is close to nibbāna.

# 33 (3) Non-Decline (2)

"Last night, bhikkhus, when the night had advanced, a certain deity of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta's Grove, approached me, paid homage to me, stood to one side, and said to me: 'Bhante, there are these six qualities that lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu. What six? Reverence for the Teacher, reverence for the Dhamma, reverence for the Sangha, reverence for the training, reverence for a sense of moral shame, and reverence for moral dread. These six qualities lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu.' This is what that deity said. Then the deity paid homage to me, circumambulated me keeping the right side toward me, and disappeared right there."

Respectful toward the Teacher, respectful toward the Dhamma, deeply revering the Sangha, endowed with moral shame and moral dread: one who is deferential and reverential cannot fall away, but is close to nibbāna.

## 34 (4) Moggallana

On one occasion the Blessed Ône was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇ̣ika's Park. Then, while the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was alone in seclusion, the following course of thought arose in him: "Which devas know: 'I am a streamenterer, no longer subject to [rebirth in] the lower world, fixed in destiny, heading for enlightenment'?" [332]

Now at that time, a bhikkhu named Tissa had recently died and been reborn in a certain brahmā world. There too they
knew him as "the brahmā Tissa, powerful and mighty." Then, just as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna disappeared from Jeta's Grove and reappeared in that brahmā world. When he saw the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna coming in the distance, the brahmā Tissa said to him:

"Come, respected Moggallāna! Welcome, respected Moggallāna! It has been long since you took the opportunity to come here. Sit down, respected Moggallāna. This seat has been prepared." The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna sat down on the prepared seat. The brahmā Tissa paid homage to him and sat down to one side. The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna then said to him:

"Which devas, Tissa, know: 'I am a stream-enterer, no longer subject to [rebirth in] the lower world, fixed in destiny, heading for enlightenment'?"

(1) "The devas [ruled by] the four great kings have such knowledge, respected Moggallāna."

"Do all the devas [ruled by] the four great kings have such knowledge, Tissa?"

"Not all, respected Moggallāna. Those who do not possess unwavering confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and who lack the virtuous behavior loved by the noble ones, do not have such [333] knowledge. But those who possess unwavering confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and who have the virtuous behavior loved by the noble ones, know: 'I am a stream-enterer, no longer subject to [rebirth in] the lower world, fixed in destiny, heading for enlightenment.'"

(2) "Do only the devas [ruled by] the four great kings have such knowledge, or do the Tāvatimsa devas... (3) ... the Yāma devas... (4) ... the Tusita devas ... (5) ... the devas who delight in creation... (6) ... the devas who control what is created by others have it?"

"The devas who control what is created by others also have such knowledge, respected Moggallāna."

"Do all the devas who control what is created by others have such knowledge, Tissa?"

"Not all, respected Moggallāna. Those who do not possess unwavering confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and
the Sangha, and who lack the virtuous behavior loved by the noble ones, do not have such knowledge. But those who possess unwavering confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and who have the virtuous behavior loved by the noble ones, know: 'I am a stream-enterer, no longer subject to [rebirth in] the lower world, fixed in destiny, heading for enlightenment.'"

Then, having delighted and rejoiced in the statement of the brahmā Tissa, just as [334] a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna disappeared from the brahmā world and reappeared in Jeta's Grove.

# 35 (5) Pertain to True Knowledge

"Bhikkhus, these six things pertain to true knowledge. What six? The perception of impermanence, the perception of suffering in the impermanent, the perception of non-self in what is suffering, the perception of abandoning, the perception of dispassion, and the perception of cessation. ${ }^{1306}$ These six things pertain to true knowledge."

## 36 (6) Disputes

"Bhikkhus, there are these six roots of disputes. What six?

(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is angry and hostile. When a bhikkhu is angry and hostile, he dwells without respect and deference toward the Teacher, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and he does not fulfill the training. Such a bhikkhu creates a dispute in the Sangha that leads to the harm of many people, to the unhappiness of many people, to the ruin, harm, and suffering of devas and humans. If, bhikkhus, you perceive any such root of dispute either in yourselves or in others, you should strive to abandon this evil root of dispute. And if you do not perceive any such root of dispute either in yourselves or in others, you should practice so that this evil root of dispute does not emerge in the future. [335] In such a way this evil root of dispute is abandoned and does not emerge in the future.

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu is a denigrator and insolent... (3)... envious and miserly... (4) ... crafty and hypocritical... (5) ... one who has evil-desires and wrong view... (6) ... one who adheres to his own views, holds to them tenaciously, and relin-
quishes them with difficulty. When a bhikkhu adheres to his own views, holds to them tenaciously, and relinquishes them with difficulty, he dwells without respect and deference toward the Teacher, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and he does not fulfill the training. Such a bhikkhu creates a dispute in the Sangha that leads to the harm of many people, to the unhappiness of many people, to the ruin, harm, and suffering of devas and humans. If, bhikkhus, you perceive any such root of dispute either in yourselves or in others, you should strive to abandon this evil root of dispute. And if you do not perceive any such root of dispute either in yourselves or others, you should practice so that this evil root of dispute does not emerge in the future. In such a way this evil root of dispute is abandoned and does not emerge in the future.

"These, bhikkhus, are the six roots of dispute." [336]

# 37 (7) Giving

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. Now on that occasion the female lay follower Velukaṇtakī Nandamātā had prepared an offering possessed of six factors for the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna. With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, the Blessed One saw the female lay follower Velukaṇtakī Nandamātā preparing this offering and he then addressed the bhikkhus:

"Bhikkhus, the female lay follower Velukaṇtakī Nandamātā is preparing an offering possessed of six factors for the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna. And how is an offering possessed of six factors? Here, the donor has three factors and the recipients have three factors.

"What are the three factors of the donor? (1) The donor is joyful before giving; (2) she has a placid, confident mind in the act of giving; and (3) she is elated after giving. These are the three factors of the donor.

"What are the three factors of the recipients? Here, (4) the recipients are devoid of lust or are practicing to remove lust; (5) they are devoid of hatred or are practicing to remove hatred; (6) they are devoid of delusion or are practicing to remove delusion. These are the three factors of the recipients.

"Thus the donor has three factors, and the recipients have
three factors. In such a way the offering possesses six factors. It is not easy to measure the merit of such an offering thus: 'Just so much is the stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, nutriment of happiness-heavenly, ripening in happiness, conducive to heaven-that leads to what is wished for, desired, and agreeable, to one's welfare and happiness'; rather, it is reckoned simply as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit. Bhikkhus, just as it is not easy to measure the water in the great ocean [337] thus: 'There are so many gallons of water,' or 'There are so many hundreds of gallons of water,' or 'There are so many thousands of gallons of water,' or 'There are so many hundreds of thousands of gallons of water,' but rather it is reckoned simply as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of water; so too, it is not easy to measure the merit of such an offering... rather, it is reckoned simply as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit."

Prior to giving one is joyful;

while giving one settles the mind in trust;

after giving one is elated:

this is success in the act of offering.

When they are devoid of lust and hatred, devoid of delusion, without taints, self-controlled, living the spiritual life, the field for the offering is complete.

Having cleansed oneself ${ }^{3307}$ and given with one's own hands, the act of charity is very fruitful for oneself and in relation to others.

Having performed such a charitable deed with a mind free from miserliness, the wise person, rich in faith, is reborn in a happy, non-afflictive world.

# 38 (8) Self-Initiative

Then a certain brahmin approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had exchanged
greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

"Master Gotama, I hold such a thesis and view as this: 'There is no self-initiative; there is no initiative taken by others. ${ }^{\prime \prime 1308}$

"Brahmin, I have never seen or heard of anyone holding such a thesis and view as this. For how [338] can one who comes on his own and returns on his own say: 'There is no self-initiative; there is no initiative taken by others'?

(1) "What do you think, brahmin? Does the element of instigation exist?"1309

"Yes, sir."

"When the element of instigation exists, are beings seen to instigate activity?"

"Yes, sir."

"When beings are seen to instigate activity because the element of instigation exists, this is the self-initiative of beings; this is the initiative taken by others.

(2) "What do you think, brahmin? Does the element of persistence exist?"

"Yes, sir."

"When the element of persistence exists, are beings seen to persist in activity?"

"Yes, sir."

"When beings are seen to persist in activity because the element of persistence exists, this is the self-initiative of beings; this is the initiative taken by others.

(3) "What do you think, brahmin? Does the element of exertion exist?"

"Yes, sir."

"When the element of exertion exists, are beings seen to exert themselves in activity?"

"Yes, sir."

"When beings are seen to exert themselves in activity because the element of exertion exists, this is the self-initiative of beings; this is the initiative taken by others.

(4) "What do you think, brahmin? Does the element of strength exist?"1310

"Yes, sir."

"When the element of strength exists, are beings seen to be possessed of strength?"
"Yes, sir."

"When beings are seen to be possessed of strength because the element of strength exists, this is the self-initiative of beings; this is the initiative taken by others.

(5) "What do you think, brahmin? Does the element of continuation exist?"

"Yes, sir."

"When the element of continuation exists, are beings seen to continue [in an action]?"

"Yes, sir."

"When beings are seen to continue [in an action] because the element of continuation exists, this is the self-initiative of beings; this is the initiative taken by others.

(6) "What do you think, brahmin? Does the element of force exist?"

"Yes, sir."

"When the element of force exists, are beings seen to act with force?"

"Yes, sir."

"When beings are seen to act with force because the element of force exists, this is the self-initiative of beings; this is the initiative taken by others.

"Brahmin, I have never seen or heard of anyone holding such a thesis and view [as yours]. For how can one who comes on his own and returns on his own say: 'There is no self-initiative; there is no initiative on the part of others'?"

"Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the darkness so those with good eyesight can see forms. I now go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

# 39 (9) Origination

"Bhikkhus, there are these three causes for the origination of kamma. What three? (1) Greed is a cause for the origination of kamma; (2) hatred is a cause for the origination of kamma; and (3) delusion is a cause for the origination of kamma.
"It is not non-greed that originates from greed; rather, it is just greed that originates from greed. It is not non-hatred that originates from hatred; rather, it is just hatred that originates from hatred. It is not non-delusion that originates from delusion; rather, it is just delusion that originates from delusion.

"It is not [339] [the realms] of devas and humans-or any other good destinations-that are seen because of kamma born of greed, hatred, and delusion; rather, it is hell, the animal realm, and the sphere of afflicted spirits-as well as other bad destinations-that are seen because of kamma born of greed, hatred, and delusion. These are three causes for the origination of kamma.

"There are, bhikkhus, these three [other] causes for the origination of kamma. What three? (4) Non-greed is a cause for the origination of kamma; (5) non-hatred is a cause for the origination of kamma; and (6) non-delusion is a cause for the origination of kamma.

"It is not greed that originates from non-greed; rather, it is just non-greed that originates from non-greed. It is not hatred that originates from non-hatred; rather, it is just non-hatred that originates from non-hatred. It is not delusion that originates from non-delusion; rather, it is just non-delusion that originates from non-delusion.

"It is not hell, the animal realm, and the sphere of afflicted spirits-or any other bad destinations-that are seen because of kamma born of non-greed, non-hatred, and non-delusion; rather, it is [the realms] of devas and humans-as well as other good destinations-that are seen because of kamma born of non-greed, non-hatred, and non-delusion. These are three [other] causes for the origination of kamma."

40 (10) Kimbila ${ }^{1311}$

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kimbilā in a nicula grove. Then the Venerable Kimbila approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: [340]

"What is the cause and reason why, Bhante, the good Dhamma does not continue long after a Tathāgata has attained final nibbāna?"
"Here, Kimbila, after a Tathāgata has attained final nibbāna, (1) the bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, male lay followers, and female lay followers dwell without reverence and deference toward the Teacher. (2) They dwell without reverence and deference toward the Dhamma. (3) They dwell without reverence and deference toward the Sangha. (4) They dwell without reverence and deference toward the training. (5) They dwell without reverence and deference toward heedfulness. (6) They dwell without reverence and deference toward hospitality. This is the cause and reason why the good Dhamma does not continue long after a Tathāgata has attained final nibbāna."

"What is the cause and reason why, Bhante, the good Dhamma continues long after a Tathāgata has attained final nibbāna?"

"Here, Kimbila, after a Tathāgata has attained final nibbāna, (1) the bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, male lay followers, and female lay followers dwell with reverence and deference toward the Teacher. (2) They dwell with reverence and deference toward the Dhamma. (3) They dwell with reverence and deference toward the Sangha. (4) They dwell with reverence and deference toward the training. (5) They dwell with reverence and deference toward heedfulness. (6) They dwell with reverence and deference toward hospitality. This is the cause and reason why the good Dhamma continues long after a Tathāgata has attained final nibbāna."

# 41 (11) A Block of Wood

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Venerable Sāriputta was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Then, in the morning, the Venerable Sāriputta dressed, took his bowl and robe, and descended from Mount Vulture Peak together with a number of bhikkhus. In a certain place he saw a large block of wood and addressed the bhikkhus: "Do you see, friends, that large block of wood?"

"Yes, friend."

(1) "If he so wished, friends, a bhikkhu possessing psychic potency who has attained mastery of mind might focus on that block of wood as earth. What [341] is the basis for this? Because the earth element exists in that block of wood. On this basis a bhikkhu possessing psychic potency who has attained mastery of mind might focus on it as earth.
(2)-(4) "If he so wished, friends, a bhikkhu possessing psychic potency who has attained mastery of mind might focus on that block of wood as water . . . as fire . . . as air. What is the basis for this? Because the water element . . . the fire element . . . the air element exists in that block of wood. On this basis a bhikkhu possessing psychic potency who has attained mastery of mind might focus on it as air.

(5)-(6) "If he so wished, friends, a bhikkhu possessing psychic potency who has attained mastery of mind might focus on that block of wood as beautiful . . . as unattractive. For what reason? Because the element of beauty . . . the element of the unattractive exists in that block of wood. On this basis a bhikkhu possessing psychic potency who has attained mastery of mind might focus on that block of wood as unattractive."

# 42 (12) Nagita ${ }^{1312}$

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Sangha of bhikkhus when he reached the Kosalan brahmin village named Icchānañgala. There the Blessed One dwelled in the Icchānañgala woodland thicket. The brahmin householders of Icchānañgala heard: "It is said that the ascetic Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan family, has arrived at Icchānañgala and is now dwelling in the Icchānañgala woodland thicket. Now a good report about that Master Gotama has circulated thus: 'That Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One. Having realized by his own direct knowledge the world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, he makes it known to others. He teaches a Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; he reveals a spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure.' Now it is good to see such arahants."

Then, when the night had passed, the brahmin householders of Icchānangala took abundant food of various kinds and went to the Icchānangala woodland thicket. They stood outside the
entrance making an uproar and a racket. Now on that occasion the Venerable Nāgita was the Blessed One's attendant. The Blessed One then addressed the Venerable Nāgita: [342] "Who is making such an uproar and a racket, Nāgita? One would think it was fishermen at a haul of fish."

"Bhante, these are the brahmin householders of Icchānañgala who have brought abundant food of various kinds. They are standing outside the entrance, [wishing to offer it] to the Blessed One and the Sangha of bhikkhus."

"Let me never come upon fame, Nāgita, and may fame never catch up with me. One who does not gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, this bliss of renunciation, bliss of solitude, bliss of peace, bliss of enlightenment that I gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, might accept that vile pleasure, that slothful pleasure, the pleasure of gain, honor, and praise."

"Let the Blessed One now consent, Bhante, let the Fortunate One consent. This is now the time for the Blessed One to consent. Wherever the Blessed One will go now, the brahmin householders of town and countryside will incline in the same direction. Just as, when thick drops of rain are pouring down, the water flows down along the slope, so too, wherever the Blessed One will go now, the brahmin householders of town and country will incline in the same direction. For what reason? Because of the Blessed One's virtuous behavior and wisdom."

"Let me never come upon fame, Nāgita, and may fame never catch up with me. One who does not gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, this bliss of renunciation... might accept that vile pleasure, that slothful pleasure, the pleasure of gain, honor, and praise.

(1) "Here, Nāgita, I see a bhikkhu dwelling on the outskirts of a village [343] sitting in a state of concentration. It then occurs to me: 'Now a monastery attendant or a novice or a co-religionist will cause that venerable one to fall away from that concentration. ${ }^{1313}$ For this reason I am not pleased with this bhikkhu's dwelling on the outskirts of a village.

(2) "I see, Nāgita, a forest-dwelling bhikkhu sitting and dozing in the forest. It then occurs to me: 'Now this venerable one will dispel this sleepiness and fatigue and attend only to the perception of forest, [a state of] oneness. ${ }^{1314}$ For this reason I am. pleased with this bhikkhu's dwelling in the forest.

(3) "I see, Nāgita, a forest-dwelling bhikkhu sitting in the
forest in an unconcentrated state. It then occurs to me: 'Now this venerable one will concentrate his unconcentrated mind or guard his concentrated mind.' For this reason I am pleased with this bhikkhu's dwelling in the forest.

(4) "I see, Nāgita, a forest-dwelling bhikkhu sitting in the forest in a state of concentration. It then occurs to me: 'Now this venerable one will liberate his unliberated mind or guard his liberated mind.' For this reason I am pleased with this bhik-. khu's dwelling in the forest.

(5) "I see, Nāgita, a bhikkhu dwelling on the outskirts of a village, who gains robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick. Desiring gain, honor, and fame, he neglects seclusion; he neglects remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves. [344] Having entered the villages, towns, and capital cities, he takes up his residence. For this reason I am not pleased with this bhikkhu's dwelling on the outskirts of a village.

(6) "I see, Nāgita, a forest-dwelling bhikkhu who gains robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick. Having dispelled that gain, honor, and praise, he does not neglect seclusion; he does not neglect remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves. For this reason I am pleased with this bhikkhu's dwelling in the forest.

"When, Nāgita, I am traveling on a highway and do not see anyone ahead of me or behind me, even if it is for the purpose of defecating and urinating, on that occasion I am at ease."1315

# V. DHAMMIKA

43 (1) The Nāga

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇ̣ika's Park. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Sāvatthī for alms. When he had walked for alms in Sāvatthī, after his meal, on returning from his alms round, he addressed the Venerable Ānanda: "Come, Ānanda, let us go to Migāramātā's Mansion in the Eastern Park [345] to pass the day."

"Yes, Bhante," the Venerable Ānanda replied.

Then the Blessed One, together with the Venerable Ānanda, went to Migāramātā's Mansion in the Eastern Park.

Then in the evening the Blessed One emerged from seclusion
and addressed the Venerable Ānanda: "Come, Ānanda, let us go to the eastern gate to bathe."

"Yes, Bhante," the Venerable Ānanda replied.

Then the Blessed One, together with the Venerable Ānanda, went to the eastern gate to bathe. Having bathed at the eastern gate and come out, he stood in one robe drying himself. On that occasion, King Pasenadi of Kosala's bull elephant ${ }^{1316}$ named "Seta" was coming out through the eastern gate to the accompaniment of instrumental music and drumming. People saw him and said: "The king's bull elephant is handsome! The king's bull elephant is beautiful! The king's bull elephant is graceful! The king's bull elephant is massive! He's a nāga, truly a nāga."

When this was said, the Venerable Udāyī said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, is it only when people see an elephant possessed of a large massive body that they say: 'A nāga, truly a nāga!' or do people also say this when they see [other] things possessed of a large massive body?"

"(1) Udāyī, when people see an elephant possessed of a large massive body, they say: 'A nāga, truly a nāga!' (2) When people see a horse possessed of a large massive body, they say: 'A nāga, truly a nāga!' (3) When people see a bull possessed of a large massive body, they say: 'A nāga, truly a nāga!' (4) When people see a serpent possessed of a large massive body, they say: 'A nāga, truly a nāga!' (5) When people see a tree [346] possessed of a large massive body, they say: 'A nāga, truly a nāga!' (6) When people see a human being possessed of a large massive body, they say: 'A nāga, truly a nāga!' But, Udāyī, in the world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, I call one a nāga who does no evil by body, speech, and mind."1317

"It's astounding and amazing, Bhante, how well this was stated by the Blessed One:'But, Udāyī, in the world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans. I call one a nāga who does no evil by body, speech, and mind.' I rejoice, Bhante, in this good statement of the Blessed One with these verses: ${ }^{1318}$

"A human being who is fully enlightened, self-tamed and concentrated,
traveling on the path of brahmā, he takes delight in peace of mind.

"I have heard from the Arahant that even the devas pay homage to him, to the same one whom humans venerate, the one who has gone beyond everything.

"He has transcended all fetters and emerged from the jungle to the clearing; ${ }^{1319}$ delighting in renunciation of sensual pleasures, he is like pure gold freed from its ore.

"He is the nāga who outshines all, like the Himalayas amid the other mountains. Among all things named nāga, he, unsurpassed, is the one truly named. ${ }^{1320}$

"I will extol for you the nāga: indeed, he does no evil.

Mildness and harmlessness are two feet of the nāga.

"Austerity and celibacy are the nāga's other two feet. ${ }^{1321}$

Faith is the great nāga's trunk, and equanimity his ivory tusks.

"Mindfulness is his neck, his head is wisdom, investigation, and reflection on phenomena. ${ }^{1322}$ Dhamma is the balanced heat of his belly, and seclusion is his tail. ${ }^{1323}$

"This meditator, delighting in consolation, ${ }^{1324}$ is inwardly well concentrated.

When walking, the nāga is concentrated; when standing, the nāga is concentrated.

"When lying down, the nāga is concentrated; when sitting, too, the nāga is concentrated. [347]

Everywhere, the nāga is restrained:

this is the nāga's accomplishment.

"He eats blameless food, but doesn't eat what is blameworthy. When he gains food and clothing, he avoids storing it up.

"Having cut off all fetters and bonds, whether they be gross or subtle, in whatever direction he goes, he goes without concern.

"The lotus flower is born and grown up in water, yet is not soiled by the water but remains fragrant and delightful.

"Just so the Buddha, well born in the world, dwells in the world, ${ }^{1329}$

yet is not soiled by the world

like the lotus [unsoiled] by water.

"A great fire all ablaze settles down when deprived of fuel, and when all the coals have gone out, it is said to be extinguished. ${ }^{1326}$

"This simile, which conveys the meaning, was taught by the wise.

Great nāgas will know the nāga that was taught by the nāga. ${ }^{1327}$

"Devoid of lust, devoid of hatred, devoid of delusion, without taints, the nāga, discarding his body, taintless, is utterly quenched and attains final nibbāna." ${ }^{1328}$

# 44.(2) Migasāāa

Then, in the morning, the Venerable Ānanda dressed, took his bowl and robe, and went to the house of the female lay follower Migasālā, where he sat down on the seat prepared for him. Then the female lay disciple Migasālā approached the Venerable Ānanda, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:

"Bhante Ānanda, just how should this teaching of the Blessed One be understood, where one who is celibate and one who is not celibate both have exactly the same destination in their. future life? [348] My father Purāṇa was celibate, living apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the common person's practice. When he died, the Blessed One declared: 'He attained to the state of a once-returner ${ }^{1329}$ and has been reborn in the Tusita group [of devas].' My paternal uncle ${ }^{1330}$ Isidatta was not celibate but lived a contented married life. When he died, the Blessed One also declared: 'He attained to the state of a once-returner and has been reborn in the Tusita group [of devas].' Bhante Ānanda, just how should this teaching of the Blessed One be understood, where one who is celibate and one who is not celibate both have exactly the same destination in their future life?"

"It was just in this way, sister, that the Blessed One declared it." ${ }^{\prime \prime 331}$

Then, when the Venerable Ānanda had received almsfood at Migasālā's house, he rose from his seat and departed. After his meal, on returning from his alms round, he went to the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: "Here, Bhante, in the morning, I dressed, took my bowl and robe, and went to the house of the female lay follower Migasālā ... [349] [all as above, down to] ... When she asked me this, I replied: 'It was just in this way, sister, that the Blessed One declared it."

[The Blessed One said:] "Who, indeed, is the female lay follower Migasālā, a foolish, incompetent woman with a woman's intellect? ${ }^{1332}$ And who are those [who have] the knowledge of other persons as superior and inferior? ${ }^{1333}$

"There are, Ānanda, these six types of persons found existing in the world. What six?

(1) "Here, Ānanda, there is one person who is mild, a pleasant
companion, with whom his fellow monks gladly dwell. But he has not listened [to the teachings], become learned [in them], and penetrated [them] by view, and he does not attain temporary liberation. ${ }^{1334}$ With the breakup of the body, after death, he heads for deterioration, not for distinction; he is one going to deterioration, not to distinction.

(2) "Then, Ānanda, there is one person who is mild, a pleasant companion, with whom his fellow monks gladly dwell. And he has listened [to the teachings], become learned [in them], and penetrated [them] by view, and he attains temporary liberation. With the breakup of the body, after death, he heads for distinction, not for deterioration; he is one going to distinction, not to deterioration.

"Ānanda, those who are judgmental will pass such judgment on them: 'This one has the same qualities as the other. Why should one be inferior and the other superior?' That [judgment] of theirs ${ }^{1335}$ will indeed lead to their harm and suffering for a long time.

"Between them, Ānanda, the person who is mild, a pleasant companion, one with whom his fellow monks gladly dwell, who has listened [to the teachings], become learned [in them], and penetrated [them] by view, and who attains temporary liberation, [350] surpasses and excels the other person. For what reason? Because the Dhamma-stream carries him along. ${ }^{1336}$ But who can know this difference except the Tathāgata?

"Therefore, Ānanda, do not be judgmental regarding people. Do not pass judgment on people. Those who pass judgment on people harm themselves. I alone, or one like me, may pass judgment on people.

(3) "Then, Ānanda, in one person anger and conceit are found, and from time to time states of greed ${ }^{1337}$ arise in him. And he has not listened [to the teachings], become learned [in them], and penetrated [them] by view, and he does not attain temporary liberation. With the breakup of the body, after death, he heads for deterioration, not for distinction; he is one going to deterioration, not to distinction.

(4) "Then, Ānanda, in one person anger and conceit are found, and from time to time states of greed arise in him. But he has listened [to the teachings], become learned [in them], and penetrated [them] by view, and he attains temporary lib-
eration. With the breakup of the body, after death, he heads for distinction, not for deterioration; he is one going to distinction, not to deterioration.

"Ānanda, those who are judgmental will pass such judgment on them.... I alone, or one like me, may pass judgment on people. ${ }^{1338}$

(5) "Then, Ānanda, in one person anger and conceit are found, and from time to time he engages in exchanges of words. ${ }^{1339}$ And he has not listened [to the teachings], become learned [in them], and penetrated [them] by view, and he does not attain temporary liberation.

"Who, indeed, is the female lay follower Migasālā, a foolish, incompetent woman with a woman's intellect? And who are those [who have] the knowledge of other persons as superior and inferior?
"These are the six types of persons found existing in the world.

"Ānanda, if Isidatta had possessed the same kind of virtuous behavior that Purāna had, Purāṇa could not have even known his destination. And if Purāṇa had possessed the same kind of wisdom that Isidatta had, Isidatta could not have even known his destination. ${ }^{1340}$ In this way, Ānanda, these two persons were each deficient in one respect."

# 45 (3) Debt

(1) "Bhikkhus, isn't poverty suffering in the world for one who enjoys sensual pleasures?"

"Yes, Bhante."

(2) "If a poor, [352] destitute, indigent person gets into debt, isn't his indebtedness, too, suffering in the world for one who enjoys sensual pleasures?"

"Yes, Bhante."

(3) "If a poor, destitute, indigent person who has gotten into debt promises to pay interest, isn't the interest, too, suffering in the world for one who enjoys sensual pleasures?"

"Yes, Bhante."

(4) "If a poor, destitute, indigent person who has promised to pay interest cannot pay it when it falls due, they reprove him. Isn't being reproved, too, suffering in the world for one who enjoys sensual pleasures?"

"Yes, Bhante."

(5) "If a poor, destitute, indigent person who is reproved does not pay, they prosecute him. Isn't prosecution, too, suffering in the world for one who enjoys sensual pleasures?"

"Yes, Bhante."

(6) "If a poor, destitute, indigent person who is prosecuted does not pay, they imprison him. Isn't imprisonment, too, suffering in the world for one who enjoys sensual pleasures?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"So, bhikkhus, for one who enjoys sensual pleasures, poverty is suffering in the world; getting into debt is suffering in the world; having to pay interest is suffering in the world; being reproved is suffering in the world; prosecution is suffering in the world; and imprisonment is suffering in the world.

(1) "So too, bhikkhus, when one does not have faith in [cul-
tivating] wholesome qualities, when one does not have a sense of moral shame in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, when one does not have moral dread in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, when one does not have energy in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, when one does not have wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, in the Noble One's discipline one is called a poor, destitute, indigent person.

(2) "Having no faith, no sense of moral shame, no moral dread, no energy, no wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, that poor, destitute, indigent person engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. This, I say, is his getting into debt.

(3) "To conceal his bodily misconduct, he nurtures an evil desire. He wishes: 'Let no one know me'; he intends [with the aim]: 'Let no one know me'; [353] he utters statements [with the aim]: 'Let no one know me'; he makes bodily endeavors [with the aim]: 'Let no one know me.'

"To conceal his verbal misconduct... To conceal his mental misconduct, he nurtures an evil desire. He wishes: 'Let no one know me'; he intends [with the aim]: 'Let no one know me'; he utters statements [with the aim]: 'Let no one know me'; he makes bodily endeavors [with the aim]: 'Let no one know me.' This, I say, is the interest he must pay.

(4) "Well-behaved fellow monks speak thus about him: 'This venerable one acts in such a way, behaves in such a way.' This, I say, is his being reproved.

(5) "When he has gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, bad unwholesome thoughts accompanied by remorse assail him. This, I say, is his prosecution.

(6) "Then, with the breakup of the body, after death, that poor, destitute, indigent person who engaged in misconduct by body, speech, and mind is bound in the prison of hell or the prison of the animal realm. I do not see, bhikkhus, any other prison that is as terrible and harsh, [and] such an obstacle to attaining the unsurpassed security from bondage, as the prison of hell or the prison of the animal realm."

Poverty is called suffering in the world; so too is getting into debt.

A poor person who becomes indebted is troubled while enjoying himself.

Then they prosecute him and he also incurs imprisonment.

This imprisonment is indeed suffering for one yearning for gain and sensual pleasures.

Just so in the Noble One's discipline, one in whom faith is lacking, [354] who is shameless and brash, heaps up a mass of evil kamma.

Having engaged in misconduct by body, speech, and mind, he forms the wish:

"May no one find out about me."

He twists around with his body, [twists around] by speech or mind; he piles up his evil deeds, in one way or another, repeatedly.

This foolish evildoer, knowing his own misdeeds, is a poor person who falls into debt, troubled while enjoying himself.

His thoughts then prosecute him; painful mental states born of remorse [follow him wherever he goes] whether in the village or the forest.

This foolish evildoer, knowing his own misdeeds, goes to a certain [animal] realm or is even bound in hell.

This indeed is the suffering of bondage ${ }^{1341}$ from which the wise person is freed, giving [gifts] with wealth righteously gained, settling his mind in confidence.

The householder endowed with faith has made a lucky throw in both cases: for his welfare in this present life and happiness in future lives. Thus it is that for home-dwellers this merit increases through generosity. ${ }^{1342}$

Just so, in the Noble One's discipline, one whose faith is firm; who is endowed with shame, dreading wrong, wise and restrained by virtuous behavior, is said to live happily in the Noble One's discipline.

Having gained spiritual happiness, one then resolves on equanimity.

Having abandoned the five hindrances, always arousing energy, he enters upon the jhānas, unified, alert, and mindful.

Having known things thus as they really are, through complete non-clinging the mind is rightly liberated with the destruction of all fetters.

With the destruction of the fetters of existence, for the stable one, rightly liberated, the knowledge occurs:

"My liberation is unshakable."

This is the supreme knowledge;

this is unsurpassed happiness.

Sorrowless, dust-free, and secure, this is the highest freedom from debt. [355]

# 46 (4) Cunda

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Venerable Mahācunda was dwelling among the Cetis at Sahajāti. There he addressed the bhikkhus:
"Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend!" those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Mahācunda said this:

(1) "Here, friends, bhikkhus who are Dhamma specialists ${ }^{1343}$ disparage those bhikkhus who are meditators, saying: 'They meditate and cogitate, [claiming]: "We are meditators, we are meditators! ${ }^{1344}$ Why do they meditate? In what way do they meditate? How do they meditate?' In this case, the bhikkhus who are Dhamma specialists aren't pleased, and the bhikkhus who are meditators aren't pleased, and they aren't practicing for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people, of devas and human beings.

(2) "But the meditating bhikkhus disparage the bhikkhus who are Dhamma specialists, saying: 'They are restless, puffed up, vain, talkative, rambling in their talk, muddle-minded, lacking clear comprehension, unconcentrated, with wandering minds, with loose sense faculties, [claiming]: "We are Dhamma specialists, we are Dhamma specialists!" Why are they Dhamma specialists? In what way are they Dhamma specialists? How are they Dhamma specialists?' In this case, the meditators aren't pleased, and the Dhamma specialists aren't pleased, and they aren't practicing for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people, of devas and human beings.

(3) "Friends, the bhikkhus who are Dhamma specialists praise only bhikkhus who are Dhamma specialists, not those who are meditators. In this case, the bhikkhus who are Dhamma specialists [356] aren't pleased, and those who are meditators aren't pleased, and they aren't practicing for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people, of devas and human beings.

(4) "But the bhikkhus who are meditators praise only bhikkhus who are also meditators, not those who are Dhamma specialists. In this case, the bhikkhus who are meditators aren't pleased, and those who are Dhamma specialists aren't pleased, and they aren't practicing for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people, of devas and human beings.

(5) "Therefore, friends, you should train yourselves thus:
'Those of us who are Dhamma specialists will praise those bhikkhus who are meditators.' Thus should you train yourselves. For what reason? Because, friends, these persons are astounding and rare in the world who dwell having touched the deathless element with the body. ${ }^{1345}$

(6) "Therefore, friends, you should train yourselves thus: 'Those of us who are meditators will praise those bhikkhus who are Dhamma specialists.' Thus should you train yourselves. For what reason? Because, friends, these persons are astounding and rare in the world who see a deep and pithy matter after piercing it through with wisdom." ${ }^{1346}$

# 47 (5) Directly Visible (1)

Then the wanderer Moliyasivaka approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. ${ }^{1347}$ When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

"Bhante, it is said: 'The directly visible Dhamma, the directly visible Dhamma.' In what way, Bhante, is the Dhamma directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise'?"1348 [357]

"Well then, Sivaka, I will question you in turn about this. Answer as you see fit. What do you think, Sivaka? (1) When there is greed within you, do you know: 'There is greed within me,' and when there is no greed within you, do you know: 'There is no greed within me'?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"Since, Sivaka, when there is greed within you, you know: 'There is greed within me,' and when there is no greed within you, you know: 'There is no greed within me,' in this way the Dhamma is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.

"What do you think, Sivaka? (2) When there is hatred within you... (3) ...delusion within you... (4) ... a state connected with greed within you ${ }^{1349} \ldots$ (5) ... a state connected with hatred within you... (6) ... a state connected with delusion within you, do you know: 'There is a state connected with delusion within me,' and when there is no state connected with delusion within you, do you know: 'There is no state connected with delusion within me'?"
"Yes, Bhante."

"Since, Sivaka, when there is a state connected with delusion within you, you know: 'There is a state connected with delusion within me,' and when there is no state connected with delusion within you, you know: 'There is no state connected with delusion within me,' in this way the Dhamma is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise."

"Excellent, Bhante! ... [as at 6:38] . . . Let the Blessed One consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

48 (6) Directly Visible (2)

Then a certain brahmin approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

"Master Gotama, it is said: 'The directly visible Dhamma, the directly visible Dhamma.' In what way, Master Gotama, [358] is the Dhamma directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise?"

"Well then, brahmin, I will question you in turn about this. Answer as you see fit. What do you think, brahmin? (1) When there is lust within you, do you know: 'There is lust within me,' and when there is no lust within you, do you know: 'There is no lust within me'?"

"Yes, sir."

"Since, brahmin, when there is lust within you, you know: 'There is lust within me,' and when there is no lust within you, you know: 'There is no lust within me,' in this way the Dhamma is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.

"What do you think, brahmin? (2) When there is hatred within you... (3) ... delusion within you ... (4) ... a bodily fault within you ${ }^{1350} \ldots$ (5) . . . a verbal fault within you ... (6) . . . a mental fault within you, do you know: 'There is a mental fault within me,' and when there is no mental fault within you, do you know: 'There is no mental fault within me'?"

"Yes, sir."
"Since, brahmin, when there is a mental fault within you, you know: 'There is a mental fault within me,' and when there is no mental fault within you, you know: 'There is no mental fault within me,' in this way the Dhamma is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise."

"Excellent, Master Gotama!...[as in 6:38]...Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

# 49 (7) Khema

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthāpindika's Park. Now on that occasion the Venerable Khema and the Venerable Sumana were dwelling at Sāvatthī [359] in the Blind Men's Grove. Then they approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Venerable Khema then said to the Blessed One:

"Bhante, when a bhikkhu is an arahant, one whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached his own goal, utterly. destroyed the fetters of existence, one completely liberated through final knowledge, it does not occur to him: (1) 'There is someone better than me,' or (2) 'There is someone equal to me,' or (3) 'There is someone inferior to me.'"

This is what the Venerable Khema said. The Teacher agreed. Then the Venerable Khema, thinking, 'The Teacher agrees with me,' got up from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and left.

Then, right after the Venerable Khema had left, the Venerable Sumana said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, when a bhikkhu is an arahant, one whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached his own goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, one completely liberated through final knowledge, it does not occur to him: (4) 'There is no one better than me,' or (5) 'There is no one equal to me,' or (6) 'There is no one inferior to me.'"

This is what the Venerable Sumana said. The Teacher agreed. Then the Venerable Sumana, thinking, 'The Teacher agrees with me,' got up from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One,
circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and left. ${ }^{1351}$

Then, soon after both monks had left, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, it is in such a way that clansmen declare final knowledge. They state the meaning but don't bring themselves into the picture. ${ }^{1352}$ But there are some foolish men here who, it seems, declare final knowledge as a joke. They will meet with distress later."

They [do not rank themselves] as superior or inferior, nor do they rank themselves as equal. ${ }^{1353}$

Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived; they continue on, freed from fetters. [360]

50 (8) Sense Faculties ${ }^{1354}$

"Bhikkhus, (1) when there is no restraint of the sense faculties, for one deficient in restraint of the sense faculties, (2) virtuous behavior lacks its proximate cause. When there is no virtuous behavior, for one deficient in virtuous behavior, (3) right concentration lacks its proximate cause. When there is no right concentration, for one deficient in right concentration, (4) the knowledge and vision of things as they really are lacks its proximate cause. When there is no knowledge and vision of things as they really are, for one deficient in the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, (5) disenchantment and dispassion lack their proximate cause. When there is no disenchantment and dispassion, for one deficient in disenchantment and dispassion, (6) the knowledge and vision of liberation lacks its proximate cause.

"Suppose there is a tree deficient in branches and foliage. Then its shoots do not grow to fullness; also its bark, softwood, and heartwood do not grow to fullness. So too, when there is no restraint of the sense faculties, for one deficient in restraint of the sense faculties, virtuous behavior lacks its proximate cause. When there is no virtuous behavior . . . the knowledge and vision of liberation lacks its proximate cause.

"Bhikkhus, (1) when there is restraint of the sense faculties, for one who exercises restraint over the sense faculties, (2) virtuous behavior possesses its proximate cause. When there is virtuous behavior, for one whose behavior is virtuous, (3) right
concentration possesses its proximate cause. When there is right concentration, for one possessing right concentration, (4) the knowledge and vision of things as they really are possesses its proximate cause. When there is the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, for one possessing the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, (5) disenchantment and dispassion possess their proximate cause. When there is disenchantment and dispassion, for one possessing disenchantment and dispassion, (6) the knowledge and vision of liberation possesses its proximate cause.

"Suppose there is a tree possessing branches and foliage. Then its shoots grow to fullness; also its bark, softwood, and heartwood grow to fullness. So too, when there is restraint of the sense faculties, for one who exercises restraint over the sense faculties, virtuous behavior possesses its proximate cause. When there is virtuous behavior... the knowledge and vision of liberation possesses its proximate cause." [361]

# 51 (9) Ānanda

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Sāriputta:

"Friend Sāriputta, how does a bhikkhu get to hear a teaching he has not heard before, not forget those teachings he has already heard, bring to mind those teachings with which he is already familiar, ${ }^{1355}$ and understand what he has not understood?"

"The Venerable Ānanda is learned. Please clear up this matter yourself."

"Then listen, friend Sāriputta, and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, friend," the Venerable Sāriputta replied. The Venerable Ānanda said this:

"Here, friend Sāriputta, (1) a bhikkhu learns the Dhamma: the discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts, and questions-and-answers. (2) He teaches the Dhamma to others in detail as he has heard it and learned it. (3) He makes others repeat the Dhamma in detail as they have heard it and learned
it. (4) He recites the Dhamma in detail as he has heard it and learned it. (5) He ponders, examines, and mentally inspects the Dhamma as he has heard it and learned it. (6) He enters upon the rains in a residence where there live elder bhikkhus who are learned, heirs to the heritage, experts on the Dhamma, experts on the discipline, experts on the outlines. From time to time he approaches them and inquires: 'How is this, Bhante? What is the meaning of this?' Those venerable ones then disclose to him what has not been disclosed, clear up what is obscure, and dispel his perplexity about numerous perplexing points. It is in this way, [362] friend Sāriputta, that a bhikkhu gets to hear a teaching he has not heard before, does not forget those teachings he has already heard, brings to mind those teachings with which he is already familiar, and understands what he has not understood."

"It's astounding and amazing, friend, how well this has been stated by the Venerable Ānanda. And we consider the Venerable Ānanda to be one who possesses these six qualities: (1) For the Venerable Ānanda has learned the Dhamma: the discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts, and questions-andanswers. (2) He teaches the Dhamma to others in detail as he has heard it and learned it. (3) He makes others repeat the Dhamma in detail as they have heard it and learned it [from him]. (4) He recites the Dhamma in detail as he has heard it and learned it. (5) He ponders, examines, and mentally inspects the Dhamma as he has heard it and learned it. (6) He enters upon the rains in a residence where there live elder bhikkhus who are highly learned, heirs to the heritage, experts on the Dhamma, experts on the discipline, experts on the outlines. From time to time he approaches them and inquires: 'How is this, Bhante? What is the meaning of this?' Those venerable ones then disclose to him what has not been disclosed, clear up what is obscure, and dispel his perplexity about numerous perplexing points."

# 52 (10) Khattiya

Then the brahmin Jāṇussonī approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One: [363]
(1) "Master Gotama, what is the aim of khattiyas? What is their quest? What is their support? What are they intent on? What is their final goal? ${ }^{\prime 1356}$

"Wealth, brahmin, is the aim of khattiyas; their quest is for wisdom; their support is power; they are intent on territory; and their final goal is sovereignty."

(2) "But, Master Gotama, what is the aim of brahmins? What is their quest? What is their support? What are they intent on? What is their final goal?"

"Wealth, brahmin, is the aim of brahmins; their quest is for wisdom; the Vedic hymns are their support; they are intent on sacrifice; and their final goal is the brahmā world."

(3) "But, Master Gotama, what is the aim of householders? What is their quest? What is their support? What are they intent on? What is their final goal?"

"Wealth, brahmin, is the aim of householders; their quest is for wisdom; their craft is their support; they are intent on work; and their final goal is to complete their work."

(4) "But, Master Gotama, what is the aim of women? What is their quest? What is their support? What are they intent on? What is their final goal?"

"A man, brahmin, is the aim of women; their quest is for adornments; sons are their support; they are intent on being without a rival; and their final goal is authority."

(5) "But, Master Gotama, what is the aim of thieves? What is their quest? What is their support? What are they intent on? What is their final goal?"

"Robbery, brahmin, is the aim of thieves; their quest is for thickets; craftiness is their support; ${ }^{1357}$ they are intent on dark places; and their final goal is to remain unseen."

(6) "But, Master Gotama, what is the aim of ascetics? What is their quest? What is their support? What are they intent on? What is their final goal?"

"Patience and mildness, brahmin, is the aim of ascetics; their quest is for wisdom; virtuous behavior is their support; they are intent on nothingness; ${ }^{1358}$ and their final goal is nibbāna."

"It's astounding and amazing, Master Gotama! Master Gotama knows the aim, quest, support, intent, and final goal of khattiyas, brahmins, householders, women, thieves, [364] and ascetics.
"Excellent, Master Gotama!...[as in 6:38]...Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."

# 53 (11) Heedfulness

Then a certain brahmin approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

"Master Gotama, is there one thing which, when developed and cultivated, can accomplish both kinds of good, the good pertaining to the present life and the good pertaining to the future life?"

"There is such a thing, brahmin."

"And what is it?"

"It is heedfulness.

(1) "Just as, brahmin, the footprints of all animals that walk fit into the footprint of the elephant, and the elephant's footprint is declared to be foremost among them with respect to size, so too heedfulness is the one thing that, when developed and cultivated, can accomplish both kinds of good, the good pertaining to the present life and the good pertaining to the future life.

(2) "Just as all the rafters of a peaked house lean toward the roof peak, slope toward the roof peak, converge upon the roof peak, and the roof peak is declared to be foremost among them, so too [365] heedfulness is the one thing that . . . can accomplish both kinds of good....

(3) "Just as a reed-cutter, having cut a bunch of reeds, grabs them by the top, shakes the bottom, shakes the two sides, and beats them, so too heedfulness is the one thing that... can accomplish both kinds of good....

(4) "Just as, when the stalk of a bunch of mangoes is cut, all the mangoes attached to the stalk follow along with it, so too heedfulness is the one thing that ... can accomplish both kinds of good....

(5) "Just as all petty princes are the vassals of a wheel-turning monarch, and the wheel-turning monarch is declared to be foremost among them, so too heedfulness is the one thing that . . . can accomplish both kinds of good....

(6) "Just as the radiance of all the stars does not amount to
a sixteenth part of the radiance of the moon, and the radiance of the moon is declared to be foremost among them, so too heedfulness is the one thing that... can accomplish both kinds of good....

"This, brahmin, is the one thing which, when developed and cultivated, can accomplish both kinds of good, the good pertaining to the present life and the good pertaining to the future life."

"Excellent, Master Gotama!... Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life." [366]

# 54 (12) Dhammika

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling in Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. On that occasion the Venerable Dhammika was the resident monk in his native district, in all the seven monasteries in his native district. ${ }^{1389}$ There the Venerable Dhammika insulted visiting bhikkhus, reviled them, harmed them, attacked them, and scolded them, and then those visiting bhikkhus left. They did not settle down but vacated the monastery.

Then it occurred to the lay followers of the native district: "We serve the Sangha of bhikkhus with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick, but the visiting bhikkhus leave. They do not settle down but vacate the monastery. Why is that so?"

Then it occurred to them: "This Venerable Dhammika insults visiting bhikkhus, reviles them, harmṣ them, attacks them, and scolds them, and then those visiting bhikkhus leave. They do not settle down but vacate the monastery. Let's banish the Venerable Dhammika."

Then the lay followers went to the Venerable Dhammika and said to him: "Bhante, leave this monastery. You've stayed here long enough."

The Venerable Dhammika then went from that monastery to another one, where again he insulted visiting bhikkhus, reviled them, harmed them, attacked them, and scolded them. And then those visiting bhikkhus left. They did not settle down [367] but vacated the monastery.

Then it occurred to the lay followers... [all as above] ... and
said to him: "Bhante, leave this monastery. You've stayed here long enough."

Then the Venerable Dhammika went from that monastery to still another one, where again he insulted visiting bhikkhus.... They did not settle down but vacated the monastery.

Then it occurred to the lay followers: "We serve the Sangha of bhikkhus with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick, but the visiting bhikkhus leave. They do not settle down but vacate the monastery. Why is that so?"

Then it occurred to the lay followers: "This Venerable Dhammika insults visiting bhikkhus.... They do not settle down [368] but vacate the monastery. Let's banish the Venerable Dhammika from all the seven monasteries in the native district."

Then the lay followers of the native district went to the Venerable Dhammika and said to him: "Bhante, depart from all the seven monasteries in the native district."

The Venerable Dhammika then thought: "I am banished by the lay followers from all seven monasteries here. Where shall I go?"

It then occurred to him: "Let me go to the Blessed One."

Then the Venerable Dhammika took his bowl and robe and left for Rājagaha. Gradually he reached Rājagaha, and then went to Mount Vulture Peak, where he approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then asked him: "Where are you coming from, Brahmin Dhammika?"1360

"Bhante, the lay followers of my native district have banished me from all seven monasteries there."

"Enough, Brahmin Dhammika! Now that you've come to me, why be concerned that you have been banished from those places? In the past, Brahmin Dhammika, some seafaring merchants set out to sea in a ship, taking along a land-spotting bird. When the ship had still not caught sight of land they released the bird. It went to the east, the west, the north, the south, upward, and to the intermediate directions. If it saw land anywhere, it went straight for it. But if it didn't see land, it returned to the ship. In the same way, when you have been banished from those places, you've come to me." [369]

"In the past, Brahmin Dhammika, King Koravya had a royal banyan tree named 'Well Grounded,' which had five branches,
cast a cool shade, and gave delight. Its canopy extended for twelve yojanas; its network of roots for five yojanas. Its fruits were as large as cooking pots and as sweet as pure honey. The king and his harem made use of one section of the tree, the army used another section, the townfolk and countryfolk used still another, ascetics and brahmins used still another, and the beasts and birds used still another. No one guarded the tree's fruits, yet no one took another's fruits.

"Then, Brahmin Dhammika, a certain man ate as much as he wanted of the tree's fruits, broke off a branch, and left. It occurred to the deity who lived in the tree: 'It's astounding and amazing how evil this man is! He ate as much as he wanted of the tree's fruits, broke off a branch, and left! Let me see to it that in the future the royal banyan tree does not yield fruit.' Then in the future the royal banyan tree did not yield fruit. Thereupon [370] King Koravya approached Sakka the ruler of the devas and said to him: 'Listen, respected sir, you should know that the royal banyan tree does not yield fruit.'

"Then Sakka the ruler of the devas performed a feat of psychic potency such that a violent rainstorm came and twisted ${ }^{1361}$ and uprooted the royal banyan tree.

"Then, Brahmin Dhammika, the deity that lived in the tree stood to one side, sad and miserable, weeping with a tearful face. Sakka approached this deity and said: 'Why, deity, do you stand to one side, sad and miserable, weeping with a tearful face?' - 'It is, sir, because a violent rainstorm came and twisted and uprooted my dwelling.' - 'But, deity, were you following the duty of a tree when the violent rainstorm came and twisted and uprooted your dwelling?' - 'But how, sir, does a tree follow the duty of a tree?' - 'Here, deity, those who need roots take its roots; those who need bark take its bark; those who need leaves take its leaves; those who need flowers take its flowers; and those who need fruit take its fruit. Yet because of this the deity does not become displeased or discontent. That's how a tree follows the duty of a tree.' - 'Sir, I wasn't following the duty of a tree when the violent rainstorm came and twisted and uprooted my dwelling.' - 'If, deity, you would follow the duty of a tree, your dwelling might return to its former state.' - 'I will, sir, follow [371] the duty of a tree. Let my dwelling be as before.'
"Then, Brahmin Dhammika, Sakka the ruler of the devas performed such a feat of psychic potency that a violent rainstorm came and turned upright the royal banyan tree and its roots were covered with bark. So too, Brahmin Dhammika, were you following the duty of an ascetic when the lay followers of the native district banished you from all seven monasteries?"

"But how, Bhante, does an ascetic follow the duty of an ascetic?"

"Here, Brahmin Dhammika, an ascetic does not insult one who insults him, does not scold one who scolds him, and does not argue with one who argues with him. That is how an ascetic follows the duty of an ascetic."

"Bhante, I wasn't following the duty of an ascetic when the lay followers banished me from all seven monasteries."

(1) "In the past, Brahmin Dhammika, there was a teacher named Sunetta, the founder of a spiritual sect, one without lust for sensual pleasures. The teacher Sunetta had many hundreds of disciples. He taught a Dhamma to his disciples for companionship with the brahmā world. ${ }^{1362}$ When he was teaching such a Dhamma, those who did not place confidence in him were, with the breakup of the body, after death, reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; but those who placed confidence in him were reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.

(2) "In the past, there was a teacher named Mūgapakkha... (3) ... a teacher named Aranemi... (4) ... a teacher named Kuddālaka... (5) ... a teacher named Hatthipāla... (6) ... [372] a teacher named Jotipāla, the founder of a spiritual sect, one without lust for sensual pleasures.... When he was teaching such a Dhamma, those who did not place confidence in him were, with the breakup of the body, after death, reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; but those who placed confidence in him were reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.

"What do you think, Brahmin Dhammika? These six teachers were founders of spiritual sects, men without lust for sensual pleasures who had retinues of many hundreds of disciples. If, with a mind of hatred, one had insulted and reviled them and their communities of disciples, wouldn't one have generated much demerit?"

"Yes, Bhante."
"If, with a mind of hatred, one had insulted and reviled these six teachers together with their communities of disciples, one would have generated much demerit. But if, with a mind of hatred, one reviles and insults a single person accomplished in view, ${ }^{1363}$ one generates even more demerit. For what reason? I say, Brahmin Dhammika, there is no injury ${ }^{1364}$ against outsiders ${ }^{1365}$ like that against [your] fellow monks. Therefore, Brahmin Dhammika, you should train yourself thus: 'We will not let hatred arise in our minds toward our fellow monks. ${ }^{1366}$ Thus, Brahmin Dhammika, should you train yourself." [373]

Sunetta, Mūgapakkha, the brahmin Aranemi, Kuddālaka, and Hatthipāla, the brahmin youth, were teachers.

And Jotipāla [known as] Govinda the chaplain of seven [kings]: these were harmless ones in the past, six teachers possessed of fame.

Unspoiled, liberated by compassion, these men had transcended the fetter of sensuality. Having expunged sensual lust, they were reborn in the brahmā world.

Their disciples too numbering many hundreds were unspoiled, liberated in compassion, men who had transcended the fetter of sensuality. Having expunged sensual lust, they were reborn in the brahmā world.

That man who, with thoughts of hatred, reviles these outside seers devoid of lust [whose minds] were concentrated, generates abundant demerit.

But the man who, with thoughts of hatred, reviles a disciple of the Buddha,
a bhikkhu accomplished in view, generates even more demerit.

One should not attack a holy person one who has abandoned viewpoints. This one is called the seventh person of the Sangha of noble ones, one not devoid of lust for sensual pleasures, whose five faculties are weak: faith, mindfulness, energy, serenity, and insight.

If one attacks such a bhikkhu, one first harms oneself; then, having harmed oneself, one afterward harms the other.

When one protects oneself, the other person is also protected. Therefore one should protect oneself; the wise person is always unhurt. [374]

# The Second Fifty

## I. The Great Chapter

## 55 (1) Sona

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Now on that occasion the Venerable Sona was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Cool Grove. ${ }^{1367}$

Then, while the Venerable Sona was alone in seclusion, the following course of thought arose in his mind: "I am one of the Blessed One's most energetic disciples, yet my mind has not been liberated from the taints by non-clinging. Now there is wealth in my family, and it is possible for me to enjoy my wealth and do meritorious deeds. Let me then give up the training and return to the lower life, so that I can enjoy my wealth and do meritorious deeds."

Then, having known with his own mind the course of thought
in the Venerable Sona's mind, just as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, the Blessed One disappeared on Mount Vulture Peak and appeared in the Cool Grove in the presence of the Venerable Sona. The Blessed One sat down on the seat prepared for him. The Venerable Sona paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him: [375]

"Sona, when you were alone in seclusion, didn't the following course of thought arise in your mind: 'I am one of the Blessed One's most energetic disciples, yet my mind has not been liberated from the taints by non-clinging. Now there is wealth in my family, and it is possible for me to enjoy my wealth and do meritorious deeds. Let me then give up the training and return to the lower life, so that I can enjoy my wealth and do meritorious deeds'?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"Tell me, Sona, in the past, when you lived at home, weren't you skilled at the lute?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"What do you think, Sona? When its strings were too tight, was your lute well tuned and easy to play?"

"No, Bhante."

"When its strings were too loose, was your lute well tuned and easy to play?"

"No, Bhante."

"But, Sona, when its strings were neither too tight nor too loose but adjusted to a balanced pitch, was your lute well tuned and easy to play?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"So too, Sona, if energy is aroused too forcefully this leads to restlessness, and if energy is too lax this leads to laziness. Therefore, Sona, resolve on a balance of energy, achieve evenness of the spiritual faculties, and take up the object there."1368

"Yes, Bhante," the Venerable Sona replied.

When the Blessed One had finished giving the Venerable Sona this exhortation, just as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, he disappeared in the Cool Grove and reappeared on Mount Vulture Peak. [376]

Then, some time later, the Venerable Sona resolved on a balance of energy, achieved evenness of the spiritual faculties,
and took up the object there. Then, dwelling alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute, in no long time the Venerable Sona realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having entered upon it, he dwelled in it. He directly knew: "Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being." And the Venerable Sona became one of the arahants.

Having attained arahantship, the Venerable Sona thought: "Let me go to the Blessed One and declare final knowledge in his presence." Then he approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:

"Bhante, when a bhikkhu is an arahant, one whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached his own goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, and become completely liberated through final knowledge, he is intent upon six things: on renunciation, on solitude, on non-affliction, on the destruction of craving, on the destruction of clinging, and on nonconfusion. ${ }^{1369}$

(1) "It may be, Bhante, that some venerable one here thinks: 'Could it be that this venerable one is intent upon renunciation on account of mere faith?' But it should not be seen in such a way. A bhikkhu with taints destroyed, who has lived the spiritual life and done his task, does not see in himself anything further to be done or any [need to] increase what has been done. ${ }^{1370} \mathrm{He}$ is intent upon renunciation because he is devoid of lust through the destruction of lust; because he is devoid of hatred through the destruction of hatred; because he is devoid of delusion through the destruction of delusion. [377]

(2) "It may be that some venerable one here thinks: 'Could it be that this venerable one is intent upon solitude because he is hankering after gain, honor, and praise?' But it should not be seen in such a way. A bhikkhu with taints destroyed, who has lived the spiritual life and done his task, does not see in himself anything further to be done or any [need to] increase what has been done. He is intent upon solitude because he is devoid of lust through the destruction of lust; because he is devoid of
hatred through the destruction of hatred; because he is devoid of delusion through the destruction of delusion.

(3) "It may be that some venerable one here thinks: 'Could it be that this venerable one is intent upon non-affliction because he has fallen back on the wrong grasp of behavior and observances as the essence? ${ }^{1371}$ But it should not be seen in such a way. A bhikkhu with taints destroyed, who has lived the spiritual life and done his task, does not see in himself anything. further to be done or any [need to] increase what has been done. He is intent upon non-affliction because he is devoid of lust through the destruction of lust; because he is devoid of hatred through the destruction of hatred; because he is devoid of delusion through the destruction of delusion.

(4) "... He is intent upon the destruction of craving because he is devoid of lust through the destruction of lust; because he is devoid of hatred through the destruction of hatred; because he is devoid of delusion through the destruction of delusion. ${ }^{1372}$

(5) "... He is intent upon the destruction of clinging because he is devoid of lust through the destruction of lust; because he is devoid of hatred through the destruction of hatred; because he is devoid of delusion through the destruction of delusion.

(6) "... He is intent upon non-confusion because he is devoid of lust through the destruction of lust; because he is devoid of hatred through the destruction of hatred; because he is devoid of delusion through the destruction of delusion.

"Bhante, when a bhikkhu is thus perfectly liberated in mind, even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into range of the eye, they do not obsess his mind; his mind is not at all affected. It remains steady, attained to imperturbability, and he observes its vanishing. ${ }^{1373}$ [378] Even if powerful sounds cognizable by the ear come into range of the ear... Even if powerful odors cognizable by the nose come into range of the nose ... Even if powerful tastes cognizable by the tongue come into range of the tongue ... Even if powerful tactile objects cognizable by the body come into range of the body... Even if powerful phenomena cognizable by the mind come into range of the mind, they do not obsess his mind; his mind is not at all affected. It remains steady, attained to imperturbability, and he observes its vanishing.

"Suppose, Bhante, there were a stone mountain, without clefts or fissures, one solid mass. If a violent rainstorm should come
from the east, it could not make it quake, wobble, and tremble; if a violent rainstorm should come from the west... from the north . . . from the south, it could not make it quake, wobble, and tremble. So too, when a bhikkhu is thus perfectly liberated in mind, even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into range of the eye ... Even if powerful phenomena cognizable by the mind come into range of the mind, they do not obsess his mind; his mind is not at all affected. It remains steady, attained to imperturbability, and he observes its vanishing."

If one is intent on renunciation and solitude of mind;

if one is intent on non-affliction

and the destruction of clinging;

if one is intent on craving's destructior

and non-confusion of mind:

when one sees the sense bases' arising,

one's mind is completely liberated.

For a bhikkhu of peaceful mind;

one completely liberated,

there's nothing further to be done,

no [need to] increase what has been done. [379]

As a stone mountain, one solid mass,

is not stirred by the wind,

so no forms and tastes, sounds,

odors, and tactile objects,

and phenomena desirable or undesirable

stir the stable one's mind.

His mind is steady and freed,

and he observes its vanishing.

# 56 (2) Phagguna

Now on a certain occasion the Venerable Phagguna was sick, afflicted, gravely ill. Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: "Bhante, the Venerable Phagguna is sick, afflicted, gravely ill. Please let the Blessed One visit him out of compassion." The Blessed One consented by silence.

Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and went to the Venerable Phagguna. The Venerable Phagguna saw the Blessed One coming in the distance and stirred on his bed. The Blessed One said to him: "Enough, Phagguna, do not stir on your bed. There are these seats that have been prepared. I will sit down there."

The Blessed Onesat down and said to the Venerable Phagguna: "I hope you are bearing up, Phagguna. I hope you are getting better. I hope that your painful feelings are subsiding and not increasing, and that their subsiding, not their increase, is to be seen."

"Bhante, I am not bearing up, I am not getting better. Strong painful feelings are increasing in me, not subsiding, and their increase, not their subsiding, is to be seen. ${ }^{1374}$ Just as if a strong man were to grind my head with the tip of a sharp sword, so too, violent winds [380] cut through my head. I am not bearing up.... Just as if a strong man were to tighten a tough leather strap around my head as a headband, so too, there are violent headpains in my head. I am not bearing up.... Just as if a skillful butcher or his apprentice were to carve up [an ox's] belly with a sharp butcher's knife, so too, violent winds are carving up my belly. I am not bearing up.... Just as if two strong men were to seize a weaker man by both arms and roast and grill him over a pit of hot coals, so too, there is a violent burning in my body. I am not bearing up, Bhante, I am not getting better. Strong painful feelings are increasing in me, not subsiding, and their increase, not their subsiding, is to be seen."

Then the Blessed One instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened the Venerable Phagguna with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left. Not long after the Blessed One left, the Venerable Phagguna died. At the time of his death, his faculties were serene.

Then the Venerable Ānanda [381] approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: "Bhante, not long after the Blessed One left, the Venerable Phagguna died. At the time of his death, his faculties were serene."

"Why, Ānanda, shouldn't the bhikkhu Phagguna's faculties have been serene? Though his mind had not yet been liberated from the five lower fetters, when he heard that discourse on the Dhamma, his mind was liberated from them. ${ }^{1375}$
"There are, Ānanda, these six benefits of listening to the Dhamma at the proper time and of examining the meaning at the proper time. ${ }^{1376}$ What six?

(1) "Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu's mind is not yet liberated from the five lower fetters, but at the time of his death he gets to see the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata teaches him the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; he reveals a spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure. When the bhikkhu hears that discourse on the Dhamma, his mind is liberated from the five lower fetters. This is the first benefit of listening to the Dhamma at the proper time.

(2) "Again, a bhikkhu's mind is not yet liberated from the five lower fetters. At the time of his death he does not get to see the Tathāgata, but he gets to see a disciple of the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata's disciple teaches him the Dhamma . . . reveals a spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure. When the bhikkhu hears that discourse on the Dhamma, his mind is liberated from the five lower fetters. This is the second benefit of listening to the Dhamma at the proper time.

(3) "Again, a bhikkhu's mind is not yet liberated from the five [382] lower fetters. At the time of his death he does not get to see the Tathāgata or a disciple of the Tathāgata, but he ponders, examines, and mentally inspects the Dhamma as he has heard it and learned it. As he does so, his mind is liberated from the five lower fetters. This is the third benefit of examining the meaning at the proper time.

(4) "Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu's mind is liberated from the five lower fetters but not yet liberated in the unsurpassed extinction of the acquisitions. ${ }^{1377}$ At the time of his death he gets to see the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata teaches him the Dhamma . . . he reveals a spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure. When the bhikkhu hears that discourse on the Dhamma, his mind is liberated in the unsurpassed extinction of the acquisitions. This is the fourth benefit of listening to the Dhamma at the proper time.

(5) "Again, a bhikkhu's mind is liberated from the five lower fetters but not yet liberated in the unsurpassed extinction of the acquisitions. At the time of his death he does not get to see the Tathāgata, but he gets to see a disciple of the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata's disciple teaches him the Dhamma . . . reveals a spiri-
tual life that is perfectly complete and pure. When the bhikkhu hears that discourse on the Dhamma, his mind is liberated in the unsurpassed extinction of the acquisitions. This is the fifth benefit of listening to the Dhamma at the proper time.

(6) "Again, a bhikkhu's mind is liberated from the five lower fetters [383] but not yet liberated in the unsurpassed extinction of the acquisitions. At the time of his death he does not get to see the Tathāgata or a disciple of the Tathāgata, but he ponders, examines, and mentally inspects the Dhamma as he has heard it and learned it. As he does so, his mind is liberated in the unsurpassed extinction of the acquisitions. This is the sixth benefit of examining the meaning at the proper time.

"These, Ānanda, are the six benefits of listening to the Dhamma at the proper time and of examining the meaning at the proper time."

# 57 (3) Six Classes

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:

"Bhante, Pūraṇa Kassapa has described six classes: ${ }^{1378}$ a black class, a blue class, a red class, a yellow class, a white class, and a supreme white class.

"He has described the black class as butchers of sheep, pigs, poultry, and deer; hunters and fishermen; thieves, executioners, and prison wardens; or those who follow any other such cruel occupation.

"He has described the blue class as bhikkhus who live on thorns ${ }^{1379}$ or any others who profess the doctrine of kamma, the doctrine of the efficacy of deeds.

"He has described the red class as the Niganṭhas [384] wearing a single garment.

"He has described the yellow class as the white-robed lay disciples of the naked ascetics.

"He has described the white class as the male and female Ājivakas.

"He has described the supreme white class as Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Sañkicca, and Makkhali Gosāla.

"Pūraṇa Kassapa, Bhante, has described these six classes."
"But, Ānanda, has the whole world authorized Pūraṇa Kassapa to describe these six classes?"

"Certainly not, Bhante."

"Suppose, Ānanda, there was a poor, destitute, indigent person. They might force a cut [of meat] on him against his will, saying: 'Good man, you must eat this piece of meat and pay for it.' In the same way, without the consent of those ascetics and brahmins, Pūraṇa Kassapa has described these six classes in a foolish, incompetent, inexpert, and unskilled way. But I, Ānanda, describe six [different] classes. Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," the Venerable Ānanda replied. The Blessed One said this:

"And what, Ānanda, are the six classes? (1) Here, someone of the black class produces a black state. (2) Someone of the black class produces a white state. (3) Someone of the black class produces nibbāna, ${ }^{1380}$ which is neither black nor white. (4) Then, someone [385] of the white class produces a black state. (5) Someone of the white class produces a white state. (6) And someone of the white class produces nibbāna, which is neither black nor white.

(1) "And how is it, Ānanda, that someone of the black class produces a black state? Here, someone has been reborn in a low family-a family of candālas, hunters, bamboo workers, cart makers, or flower scavengers-one that is poor, with little food and drink, that subsists with difficulty, where food and clothing are obtained with difficulty; and he is ugly, unsightly, dwarfish, with much illness-blind, crippled, lame, or paralyzed. ${ }^{1381}$ He does not obtain food, drink, clothing, and vehicles; garlands, scents, and unguents; bedding, housing, and lighting. He engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. In consequence, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. It is in such a way that someone of the black class produces a black state.

(2) "And how is it, Ānanda, that someone of the black class produces a white state? Here, someone has been reborn in a low family... He does not obtain food ... and lighting. He engages in good conduct by body, speech, and mind. In consequence, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in a
good destination, in a heavenly world. It is in such a way that someone of the black class produces a white state.

(3) "And how is it, Ānanda, that someone of the black class produces nibbāna, which is neither black nor white? Here, someone has been reborn in a low family... [386]... He does not obtain food . . . and lighting. Having shaved off his hair and beard, he puts on ochre robes and goes forth from the household life into homelessness. When he has thus gone forth, he abandons the five hindrances, defilements of the mind, things that weaken wisdom; and then, with his mind well established in the four establishments of mindfulness, he correctly develops the seven factors of enlightenment and produces nibbāna, which is neither black nor white. It is in such a way that someone of the black class produces nibbāna, which is neither black nor white.

(4) "And how is it, Ānanda, that someone of the white class produces a black state? Here, someone has been reborn in a high family-an affluent khattiya family, an affluent brahmin family, or an affluent householder family-one that is rich, with great wealth and property, abundant gold and silver, abundant treasures and commodities, abundant wealth and grain; and he is handsome, attractive, graceful, possessing supreme beauty of complexion. He obtains food, drink, clothing, and vehicles; garlands, scents, and unguents; bedding, housing, and lighting. He engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. In consequence, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. It is in such a way that someone of the white class produces a black state.

(5) "And how is it, Ānanda, that someone of the white class produces a white state? Here, someone has been reborn in a high family. . . . He obtains food . . . and lighting. He engages in good conduct by body, speech, and mind. In consequence, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. It is in such a way that someone of the white class produces a white state.

(6) "And how is it, Ānanda, that someone of the white class produces nibbāna, which is neither black nor white? [387] Here, someone has been reborn in a high family... He obtains food ... and lighting. Having shaved off his hair and beard, he
puts on ochre robes and goes forth from the household life into homelessness. When he has thus gone forth, he abandons the five hindrances, defilements of the mind, things that weaken wisdom; and then, with his mind well established in the four establishments of mindfulness, he correctly develops the seven factors of enlightenment and produces nibbāna, which is neither black nor white. It is in such a way that someone of the white class produces nibbāna, which is neither black nor white.

"These, Ānanda, are the six classes."

# 58 (4) Taints

"Bhikkhus, possessing six qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What six? Here, by restraint a bhikkhu has abandoned those taints that are to be abandoned by restraint; by using he has abandoned those taints that are to be abandoned by using; by patiently enduring he has abandoned those taints that are to be abandoned by patiently enduring; by avoiding he has abandoned those taints that are to be abandoned by avoiding; by dispelling he has abandoned those taints that are to be abandoned by dispelling; and by developing he has abandoned those taints that are to be abandoned by developing. ${ }^{1382}$

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, are the taints to be abandoned by restraint that have been abandoned by restraint? Here, having reflected carefully, a bhikkhu dwells restrained over the eye faculty. Those [388] taints, distressful and feverish, that might arise in one who dwells unrestrained over the eye faculty do not occur in one who dwells restrained over the eye faculty. Having reflected carefully, a bhikkhu dwells restrained over the ear faculty . . . nose faculty . . tongue faculty . . . body faculty . . . mind faculty. Those taints, distressful and feverish, that might arise in one who dwells unrestrained over the mind faculty do not occur in one who dwells restrained over the mind faculty. Those taints, distressful and feverish, that might arise in one who dwells unrestrained [over these things] do not occur in one who dwells restrained. ${ }^{1383}$ These are called the taints to be abandoned by restraint that have been abandoned by restraint.

(2) "And what are the taints to be abandoned by using that have been abandoned by using? Here, reflecting carefully a
bhikkhu uses a robe only for warding off cold; for warding off heat; for warding off contact with flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and serpents; and only for covering the private parts. Reflecting carefully, he uses almsfood neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for the sake, of physical beauty and attractiveness, but only for the support and maintenance of this body, for avoiding harm, and for assisting the spiritual life, considering: 'Thus I shall terminate the old feeling and not arouse a new feeling, and I shall be healthy and blameless and dwell at ease.' Reflecting carefully, he uses a lodging only for warding off cold; for warding off heat; for warding off contact with flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and serpents; and only for protection from rough weather and for enjoying seclusion. Reflecting carefully, he uses medicines and provisions for the sick only for warding off arisen oppressive feelings and to sustain his health. [389] Those taints, distressful and feverish, that might arise in one who does not make use [of these things] do not arise in one who uses them. These are called the taints to be abandoned by using that have been abandoned by using.

(3) "And what are the taints to be abandoned by patiently enduring that have been abandoned by patiently enduring? Here, reflecting carefully a bhikkhu patiently endures cold and heat, hunger and thirst; contact with flies, mosquitoes, wind, the burning sun, and serpents; rude and offensive ways of speech; he bears up with arisen bodily feelings that are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, harrowing, disagreeable, sapping one's vitality. Those taints, distressful and feverish, that might arise in one who does not patiently endure [these things] do not arise in one who patiently endures them. These are called the taints to be abandoned by patiently enduring that have been abandoned by patiently enduring.

(4) "And what are the taints to be abandoned by avoiding that have been abandoned by avoiding? Here, reflecting carefully a bhikkhu avoids a wild elephant, a wild horse, a wild bull, and a wild dog; he avoids a snake, a stump, a clump of thorns, a pit, a precipice, a refuse dump, and a cesspit. Reflecting carefully, he avoids sitting in unsuitable seats, and wandering in unsuitable alms resorts, and associating with bad friends, such that his wise fellow monks might suspect him of evil deeds. Those
taints, distressful and feverish, that might arise in one who does not avoid [these things] do not arise in one who avoids them. [390] These are called the taints to be abandoned by avoiding that have been abandoned by avoiding.

(5) "And what are the taints to be abandoned by dispelling that have been abandoned by dispelling? Here, reflecting carefully a bhikkhu does not tolerate an arisen sensual thought; he abandons it, dispels it, terminates it, and obliterates it. Reflecting carefully, he does not tolerate an arisen thought of ill will...an arisen thought of harming...bad unwholesome states whenever they arise; he abandons them, dispels them; terminates them, and obliterates them. Those taints, distressful and feverish, that might arise in one who does not dispel [these things] do not arise in one who dispels them. These are called the taints to be abandoned by dispelling that have been abandoned by dispelling.

(6) "And what are the taints to be abandoned by developing that have been abandoned by developing? Here, reflecting carefully a bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release. Reflecting carefully, he develops the enlightenment factor of discrimination of phenomena . . . the enlightenment factor of energy ... the enlightenment factor of rapture . . . the enlightenment factor of tranquility ... the enlightenment factor of concentration . . . the enlightenment factor of equanimity, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release. Those taints, distressful and feverish, that might arise in one who does not develop [these things] do not arise in one who develops them. These are called the taints to be abandoned by developing that have been abandoned by developing.

"Possessing these six qualities, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world." [391]

# 59 (5) Dārukammika

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Nädika in the brick hall. Then the householder Dārukammika ${ }^{1384}$ approached the Blessed One, paid homage
to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him: "Does your family give gifts, householder?"

"My family gives gifts, Bhante. And those gifts are given to bhikkhus who are arahants or on the path to arahantship, those who are forest dwellers, almsfood collectors, and wearers of rag-robes." ${ }^{1385}$

"Since, householder, you are a layman enjoying sensual pleasures, living at home in a house full of children, using sandalwood from Kāsi, wearing garlands, scents, and unguents, and receiving gold and silver, it is difficult for you to know: 'These are arahants or on the path to arahantship.'

(1) "If, householder, a bhikkhu who is a forest-dweller is restless, puffed up, vain, talkative, rambling in his talk, muddleminded, lacking clear comprehension, unconcentrated, with a wandering mind, with loose sense faculties, then in this respect he is blameworthy. But if a bhikkhu who is a forest-dweller is not restless, puffed up, and vain, is not talkative and rambling in his talk, but has mindfulness established, clearly comprehends, is concentrated, with a one-pointed mind, with restrained sense faculties, then in this respect he is praiseworthy.

(2) "If a bhikkhu who dwells on the outskirts of a village is restless... with loose sense faculties, then in this respect he is blameworthy. But if a bhikkhu who dwells on the outskirts of a village is not restless... with restrained sense faculties, then in this respect he is praiseworthy.

(3) "If a bhikkhu who is an almsfood collector is restless... with loose sense faculties, then in this respect he is blameworthy. But if a bhikkhu who is an almsfood collector is not restless [392]... with restrained sense faculties, then in this respect he is praiseworthy.

(4) "If a bhikkhu who accepts invitations to meals is restless . . . with loose sense faculties, then in this respect he is blameworthy. But if a bhikkhu who accepts invitations to meals is not restless... with restrained sense faculties, then in this respect he is praiseworthy.

(5) "If a bhikkhu who wears rag-robes is restless . . . with loose sense faculties, then in this respect he is blameworthy. But if a bhikkhu who wears rag-robes is not restless . . . with restrained sense faculties, then in this respect he is praiseworthy.

(6) "If a bhikkhu who wears robes given by householders
is restless... with loose sense faculties, then in this respect he is blameworthy. But if a bhikkhu who wears robes given by householders is not restless... with restrained sense faculties, then in this respect he is praiseworthy.

"Come now, householder, give gifts to the Sangha. When you give gifts to the Sangha, your mind will be confident. When your mind is confident, with the breakup of the body, after death, you will be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world."

"Bhante, from today onward I will give gifts to the Sangha." ${ }^{1386}$

# 60 (6) Hatthi

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Bārānasī in the deer park at Isipatana. Now on that occasion, after their meal, on returning from their alms round, a number of elder bhikkhus assembled and were sitting together in the pavilion hall engaged in a discussion pertaining to the Dhamma. ${ }^{1387}$ While they were engaged in their discussion, the Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta repeatedly interrupted their talk. ${ }^{1388}$ The Venerable Mahākotṭhita then told the Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta:

"When elder bhikkhus are engaged in a discussion pertaining to the Dhamma, don't repeatedly [393] interrupt their talk but wait until their discussion is finished."

When this was said, the Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta's bhikkhu friends said to the Venerable Mahākotthita: "Don't disparage the Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta. The Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta is wise and capable of engaging with the elder bhikkhus in a discussion pertaining to the Dhamma."

[The Venerable Mahākotṭhita said:] "It's difficult, friends, for those who don't know the course of another's mind to know this.

(1) "Here, friends, some person appears to be extremely mild, humble, and calm so long as he is staying near the Teacher or a fellow monk in the position of a teacher. But when he leaves the Teacher and fellow monks in the position of a teacher, he bonds with [other] bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, male and female lay followers, kings and royal ministers, sectarian teachers and the disciples of sectarian teachers. As he bonds with them and
becomes intimate with them, as he loosens up and talks with them, lust invades his mind. With his mind invaded by lust, he gives up the training and reverts to the lower life.

"Suppose a crop-eating bull was bound by a rope or shut up in a pen. Could one rightly say: 'Now this crop-eating bull will never again enter among the crops'?"

"Certainly not, friend. For it is possible that this crop-eating bull will break the rope or burst out of the pen and again enter among the crops."

"So too, some [394] person here is extremely mild.... But when he leaves the Teacher and fellow monks in the position of a teacher, he bonds with [other] bhikkhus . . . he gives up the training and reverts to the lower life.

(2) "Then, friends, secluded from sensual pleasures...some person enters and dwells in the first jhāna. [Thinking,] 'I am one who gains the first jhāna,' he bonds with [other] bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, male and female lay followers, kings and royal ministers, sectarian teachers and their disciples. As he bonds with them and becomes intimate with them, as he loosens up and talks with them, lust invades his mind. With his mind invaded by lust, he gives up the training and reverts to the lower life.

"Suppose that on the crossroads the rain, falling in thick droplets, would make the dust disappear and cause mud to appear. Could one rightly say: 'Now dust will never reappear at this crossroads'?"

"Certainly not, friend. For it is possible that people will pass through this crossroads, or that cattle and goats ${ }^{1589}$ will pass through, or that wind and the sun's heat will dry up the moisture, and then dust will reappear."

"So too, secluded from sensual pleasures... some person enters and dwells in the first jhāna. [Thinking,] 'I am one who gains the first jhāna,' he bonds with [other] bhikkhus... he gives up the training and reverts to the lower life. [395]

(3) "Then, friends, with the subsiding of thought and examination, some person enters and dwells in the second jhāna.... [Thinking,] 'I am one who gains the second jhāna,' he bonds with [other] bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, male and female lay followers, kings and royal ministers, sectarian teachers and their disciples. As he bonds with them and becomes intimate with
them, as he loosens up and talks with them, lust invades his mind. With his mind invaded by lust, he gives up the training and reverts to the lower life.

"Suppose that not far from a village or town there was a large pond. The rain, falling in thick droplets, would make the various kinds of shells, ${ }^{1390}$ the gravel and pebbles, disappear. Could one rightly say: 'Now the various kinds of shells, the gravel and pebbles, will never reappear in this pond'?"

"Certainly not, friend. For it is possible that people will drink from this pond, or that cattle and goats will drink from it, or that wind and the sun's heat will dry up the moisture. Then the various kinds of shells, the gravel and pebbles, will reappear."

"So too, with the subsiding of thought and examination, some person enters and dwells in the second jhāna.... [Thinking,] 'I am one who gains the second jhāna,' he bonds with [other] bhikkhus... he gives up the training and reverts to the lower life.

(4) "Then, friends, with the fading away as well of rapture, some person . . . enters and dwells in the third jhāna.... [Thinking,] 'I am one who gains the third jhāna,' he bonds with [other] bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, male and female lay followers, kings and royal ministers, sectarian teachers and their disciples. As he bonds with them and becomes intimate with them, as he loosens up and engages in talk with them, lust invades his mind. With his mind invaded by lust, he gives up the training and reverts to the lower life.

"Suppose that the food left over from the previous evening [396] would not appeal to a man who had finished a delicious meal. Could one rightly say: 'Now food will never again appeal to this man'?"

"Certainly not, friend. For more food will not appeal to that man so long as the nutritive essence remains in his body, but when the nutritive essence disappears, it is possible that such food will again appeal to him."

"So too, with the fading away as well of rapture, some person...enters and dwells in the third jhāna.... [Thinking,] 'I am one who gains the third jhāna,' he bonds with [other] bhikkhus... he gives up the training and reverts to the lower life.

(5) "Then, friends, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain... some person enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna....
[Thinking,] 'I am one who gains the fourth jhāna,' he bonds with [other] bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, male and female lay followers, kings and royal ministers, sectarian teachers and their disciples. As he bonds with them and becomes intimate with them, as he loosens up and talks with them, lust invades his mind. With his mind invaded by lust, he gives up the training and reverts to the lower life.

"Suppose that in a mountain glen there was a lake sheltered from the wind and devoid of waves. Could one rightly say: 'Now waves will never reappear on this lake'?"

"Certainly not, friend. For it is possible that a violent rainstorm might come from the east, [397] the west, the north, or the south and stir up waves on the lake."

"So too, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain... some person here enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna.... [Thinking,] 'I am one who gains the fourth jhāna,' he bonds with [other] bhikkhus... he gives up the training and reverts to the lower life.

(6) "Then, friends, through non-attention to all marks, some person enters and dwells in the markless mental concentration. ${ }^{1391}$ [Thinking,] 'I am one who gains the markless mental concentration,' he bonds with [other] bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, male and female lay followers, kings and royal ministers, sectarian teachers and their disciples. As he bonds with them and becomes intimate with them, as he loosens up and talks with them, lust invades his mind. With his mind invaded by lust, he gives up the training and reverts to the lower life.

"Suppose that a king or royal minister had been traveling along a highway with a four-factored army and set up camp for the night in a forest thicket. Because of the sounds of the elephants, horses, charioteers, and infantry, and the sound and uproar of drums, kettledrums, conches, and tom-toms, the sound of the crickets would disappear. Could one rightly say: 'Now the sound of the crickets will never reappear in this forest thicket'?" [398]

"Certainly not, friend. For it is possible that the king or roval minister will leave that forest thicket, and then the sound of the crickets will reappear."

"So too, through non-attention to all marks, some person here enters and dwells in the markless mental concentration.

Thinking, 'I am one who gains the markless mental concentration,' he bonds with [other] bhikkhus . . . he gives up the training and reverts to the lower life."

On a later occasion the Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta gave up the training and returned to the lower life. His bhikkhu friends then approached the Venerable Mahākotṭhita and said to him: "Did the Venerable Mahākotṭhita encompass Citta Hatthisāriputta's mind with his own mind and understand: 'Citta Hatthisāriputta gains such and such meditative dwellings and attainments, yet he will give up the training and return to the lower life'? Or did deities report this matter to him?"

"Friends, I encompassed Citta Hatthisāriputta's mind with my own mind and understood: 'Citta Hatthisāriputta gains such and such meditative dwellings and attainments, yet he will give up the training and return to the lower life.' And also deities reported this matter to me.".

Then those bhikkhu friends of Citta Hatthisāriputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, [399] sat down to one side, and said: "Bhante, Citta Hatthisāriputta gained such and such meditative dwellings and attainments, yet he gave up the training and returned to the lower life."

"Before long, bhikkhus, Citta will think of renouncing." ${ }^{1392}$

Not long afterward, Citta Hatthisāriputta shaved off his hair and beard, put on ochre robes, and went forth from the household life into homelessness. Then, dwelling alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute, in no long time the Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having entered upon it, he dwelled in it. ${ }^{1393}$ He directly knew: "Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being." And the Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta became one of the arahants.

# 61 (7) Middle

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Bārānasī in the deer park at Isipatana. Now on that occasion, after their meal, on returning from their alms round, a number of elder bhikkhus assembled and were sitting together
in the pavilion hall when this conversation arose: "It was said, friends, by the Blessed One in the Pārāyana, in 'The Questions of Metteyya': ${ }^{1394}$

"'Having understood both ends, the wise one does not stick in the middle. ${ }^{1395}$

I call him a great man:

he has here transcended the seamstress.'

"What, friends, is the first end? What is the second end? What is in the middle? And what is the seamstress?"

(1) When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus: "Contact, friends, is one end; the arising of contact is the second [400] end; the cessation of contact is in the middle; and craving is the seamstress. For craving sews one to the production of this or that state of existence. ${ }^{1396}$ It is in this way that a bhikkhu directly knows what should be directly known; fully understands what should be fully understood; and by doing so, in this very life he makes an end of suffering."1397

(2) When this was said, another bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus: "The past, friends, is one end; the future is the second end; the present is in the middle; and craving is the seamstress. For craving sews one to the production of this or that state of existence. It is in this way that a bhikkhu directly knows what should be directly known... in this very life he makes an end of suffering."

(3) When this was said, another bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus: "Pleasant feeling, friends, is one end; painful feeling is the second end; neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling is in the middle; and craving is the seamstress. For craving sews one to the production of this or that state of existence. It is in this way that a bhikkhu directly knows what should be directly known... in this very life he makes an end of suffering."

(4) When this was said, another bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus: "Name, friends, is one end; form is the second end; consciousness is in the middle; and craving is the seamstress. ${ }^{1398}$ For craving sews one to the production of this or that state of existence. It is in this way that a bhikkhu directly knows what should be directly known... in this very life he makes an end of suffering."

(5) When this was said, another bhikkhu-said to the elder
bhikkhus: "The six internal bases, friends, are one end; the six external bases are the second end; consciousness is in the middle; and craving is the seamstress. ${ }^{1399}$ For craving sews one to the production of this or that state of existence. It is in this way that a bhikkhu [401] directly knows what should be directly known . . . in this very life he makes an end of suffering."

(6) When this was said, another bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus: "Personal existence, friends, is one end; the origin of personal existence is the second end; the cessation of personal existence is in the middle; and craving is the seamstress. ${ }^{1400}$ For craving sews one to the production of this or that state of existence. It is in this way that a bhikkhu directly knows what should be directly known; fully understands what should be fully understood; and by doing so, in this very life he makes an end of suffering."

When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus: "Friends, we have each explained according to our own inspiration. Come, let's go to the Blessed One and report this matter to him. As the Blessed One explains it to us, so should we retain it in mind."

"Yes, friend," those elder bhikkhus replied. Then the elder bhikkhus went to the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and reported to him the entire conversation that had taken place, [asking:] "Bhante, which of us has spoken well?"

[The Blessed One said:] "In a way, bhikkhus, you have all spoken well, but listen and attend closely as I tell you what I intended when I said in the Pārāyana, in 'The Questions of Metteyya':

"'Having understood both ends, the wise one does not stick in the middle. I call him a great man:

he has here transcended the seamstress.'"

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Contact, bhikkhus, is one [402] end; the arising of contact is the second end; the cessation of contact is in the middle; and craving is the seamstress. For craving sews one to the produc-
tion of this or that state of existence. It is in this way that a bhikkhu directly knows what should be directly known; fully understands what should be fully understood; and by doing so, in this very life he makes an end of suffering."1401

62 (B) Knowledge ${ }^{1402}$

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Sangha of bhikkhus when he arrived at a Kosalan town named Dandakappaka. Then the Blessed One left the highway and sat down on a seat that was prepared for him at the foot of a tree, and those bhikkhus entered Dandakappaka to search for a rest house.

Then the Venerable Ānanda together with a number of bhikkhus went down to the Aciravati River to bathe. Having finished bathing and come back out, he stood in one robe drying his body. Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Venerable Ānanda and said to him: "Friend Ānanda, was it after full consideration that the Blessed One declared of Devadatta: 'Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for the eon, unredeemable,' or did he say this only figuratively?"

"It was just in this way, friend, that the Blessed One declared it."1403

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and [reported what had happened, ending]: [403] "When this was said, Bhante, I said to that bhikkhu: 'It was just in this way, friend, that the Blessed One declared it.'"

[The Blessed One said:] "Ānanda, that bhikkhu must be either newly ordained, not long gone forth, or a foolish and incompetent elder. For when this was declared by me definitively, how can he see any ambiguity in it? ${ }^{1404}$ I do not see even one other person, Ānanda, about whom I have made a declaration after giving him such full consideration as Devadatta. As long as I saw even a mere fraction of a hair's tip of a bright quality in Devadatta, I did not declare of him: 'Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for an eon, unredeemable.' It was, Ānanda, only when I did not see even a mere fraction of a hair's tip of a bright quality ${ }^{1405}$ in Devadatta that I declared this of him.
"Suppose there was a cesspit deeper than a man's height full of feces right up to the top, and a man was sunk in it so that his head was submerged. Then a man would appear desiring his good, welfare, and security, wishing to pull him out from the cesspit. He would go around the cesspit on all sides but would not see even a mere fraction of a hair's tip of the man not smeared with feces [404] where he might get a grip and pull him out. So too, Ānanda, it was only when I did not see even a mere fraction of a hair's tip of a bright quality in Devadatta that I declared of him: 'Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for an eon, unredeemable.'

"If, Ānanda, you would listen to the Tathāgata's knowledges of a person's faculties, I will analyze them." ${ }^{1406}$

"It is the time for this, Blessed One! It is the time for this, Fortunate One! The Blessed One should analyze his knowledges of a person's faculties. Having heard this from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will retain it in mind."

"Well then, Ānanda, listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," the Venerable Ānanda replied. The Blessed One said this:

(1) "Here, Ānanda, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand some person thus: 'Wholesome qualities and unwholesome qualities are found in this person.' On a later occasion, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand him thus: 'This person's wholesome qualities have disappeared, unwholesome qualities are manifest, but he has a wholesome root that has not been eradicated. From that wholesome root ${ }^{1407}$ of his the wholesome will appear. Thus this person will not be subject to decline in the future.' Suppose seeds that are intact, unspoiled, not damaged by wind and the sun's heat, fecund, well preserved, were deposited in well-prepared soil in a good field. Wouldn't you know: 'These seeds will grow, increase, and mature'?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"In the same way, Ānanda, having encompassed his mind with my own mind ... [405]...I understand him thus: 'This person's wholesome qualities have disappeared, unwholesome qualities are manifest, but he has a wholesome root that has not been eradicated. From that wholesome root of his the
wholesome will appear. Thus this person will not be subject to decline in the future.' In this way, Ananda, the Tathāgata knows a person by encompassing his mind with his own mind. In this way, the Tathāgata has knowledge of a person's faculties, acquired by encompassing his mind with his own mind. In this way, the Tathāgata knows the future origination of qualities by encompassing [another's] mind with his own mind.

(2) "Then, Ananda, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand some person thus: 'Wholesome qualities and unwholesome qualities are found in this person.' On a later occasion, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand him thus: 'This person's unwholesome qualities have disappeared, wholesome qualities are manifest, but he has an unwholesome root that has not been eradicated. From that unwholesome root of his the unwholesome will appear. Thus this person will be subject to decline in the future.' Suppose, Ananda, seeds that are intact, unspoiled, not damaged by wind and the sun's heat, fecund, well preserved, were deposited on a wide rock. Wouldn't you know: 'These seeds will not grow, increase, and mature'?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"In the same way, Ananda, having encompassed his mind with my own mind...I understand him thus: 'This person's unwholesome qualities have disappeared, wholesome qualities are manifest, but he has an unwholesome root that has not been eradicated. From that unwholesome root of his the unwholesome will appear. Thus this person [406] will be subject to decline in the future.' In this way, Ārianda, the Tathāgata knows a person by encompassing his mind with his own mind. In this way, the Tathāgata has knowledge of a person's faculties, acquired by encompassing his mind with his own mind. In this way, the Tathāgata knows the future origination of qualities by encompassing [another's] mind with his own mind.

(3) "Then, Ānanda, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand some person thus: 'Wholesome qualities and unwholesome qualities are found in this person.' On a later occasion, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand him thus: 'This person does not have even a mere fraction of a hair's tip of a bright quality. This person possesses exclusively black, unwholesome qualities. With the
breakup of the body, after death, he will be reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.' Suppose, Ānanda, seeds that are broken, spoiled, damaged by wind and the sun's heat, were deposited in well-prepared soil in a good field. Wouldn't you know: 'These seeds will not grow, increase, and mature'?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"In the same way, Ānanda, having encompassed his mind with my own mind . . I understand him thus: 'This person does not have even a mere fraction of a hair's tip of a bright quality. This person possesses exclusively black, unwholesome qualities. With the breakup of the body, after death, he will be reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.' In this way, Ānanda, the Tathāgata knows a person by encompassing his mind with his own mind. In this way, the Tathāgata has knowledge of a person's faculties, acquired by encompassing his mind with his own mind. In this way, the Tathāgata knows the future origination of qualities by encompassing [another's] mind with his own mind."

When this was said, the Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: [407] "Is it possible, Bhante, to describe three other persons as the counterparts of those three?"

"It is possible, Ānanda," the Blessed One said.

(4) "Here, Ānanda, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand some person thus: 'Wholesome qualities and unwholesome qualities are found in this person.' On a later occasion, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand him thus: 'This person's wholesome qualities have disappeared, unwholesome qualities are manifest, but he has a wholesome root that has not been eradicated. That, too, is about to be completely destroyed. Thus this person will be subject to decline in the future.' Suppose, Ānanda, coals that are burning, blazing, and glowing were deposited on a wide rock. Wouldn't you know: 'These coals will not grow, increase, and spread'?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"Or suppose, Ānanda, it is evening and the sun is setting. Wouldn't you know: 'Light will disappear and darkness will appear'?"

"Yes, Bhante."
"Or suppose, Ānanda, it is close to midnight, the time for a meal. ${ }^{1408}$ Wouldn't you know: 'Light has disappeared and darkness has appeared'?

"Yes, Bhante."

"In the same way, Ānanda, having encompassed his mind with my own mind...I understand him thus: 'This person's wholesome qualities have disappeared, unwholesome qualities are manifest, but he has a wholesome root that has not been eradicated. That, too, is about to be completely destroyed. Thus this person will be subject to decline in the future.' In this way, Ānanda, the Tathāgata knows a person by encompassing his mind with his own mind. In this way, [408] the Tathāgata has knowledge of a person's faculties, acquired by encompassing his mind with his own mind. In this way, the Tathāgata knows the future origination of qualities by encompassing [another's] mind with his own mind.

(5) "Then, Ānanda, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand some person thus: 'Wholesome qualities and unwholesome qualities are found in this person.' On a later occasion, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand him thus: 'This person's unwholesome qualities have disappeared, wholesome qualities are manifest, but he has an unwholesome root that has not been eradicated. That, too, is about to be completely destroyed. Thus this person will not be subject to decline in the future.' Suppose, Ānanda, coals that are burning, blazing, and glowing were deposited on a heap of dry grass or firewood. Wouldn't you know: 'These coals will grow, increase, and spread'?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"Or suppose, Ānanda, it is the time when the night is fading and the sun is rising. Wouldn't you know: 'Darkness will disappear and light will appear'?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"Or suppose, Ānanda, it is close to noon, the time for a meal. Wouldn't you know: 'Darkness has disappeared and light has appeared'?

"Yes, Bhante."

"In the same way, Ānanda, having encompassed his mind with my own mind...I understand him thus: 'This person's unwholesome qualities have disappeared, wholesome qualities

(6) "Then, Ānanda, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand some person thus: 'Wholesome qualities and unwholesome qualities are found in this person.' On a later occasion, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand him thus: 'This person does not have even a mere fraction of a hair's tip of an unwholesome quality. This person possesses exclusively bright, blameless qualities. He will attain nibbāna in this very life.' Suppose, Ānanda, coals that are cool and extinguished were deposited on a heap of dry grass or firewood. Wouldn't you know: 'These coals will not grow, increase, and spread'?"

"Yes, Bhante."

"Ānanda, among the former three persons, one is not subject to decline, one is subject to decline, and one is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell. Among the latter three persons, one is not subject to decline, one is subject to decline, and one is bound to attain nibbāna." [410]

# 63 (9) Penetrative

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you a penetrative exposition of the Dhamma. ${ }^{1409}$ Listen and attend closely. I will speak."
"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"And what, bhikkhus, is that penetrative exposition of the Dhamma?

(1) "Sensual pleasures should be understood; the source and origin of sensual pleasures should be understood; the diversity of sensual pleasures should be understood; the result of sensual pleasures should be understood; the cessation of sensual pleasures should be understood; the way leading to the cessation of sensual pleasures should be understood:

(2) "Feelings should be understood; the source and origin of feelings should be understood; the diversity of feelings should be understood; the result of feelings should be understood; the cessation of feelings should be understood; the way leading to the cessation of feelings should be understood.

(3) "Perceptions should be understood; the source and origin of perceptions should be understood; the diversity of perceptions should be understood; the result of perceptions should be understood; the cessation of perceptions should be understood; the way leading to the cessation of perceptions should be understood.

(4) "The taints should be understood; the source and origin of the taints should be understood; the diversity of the taints should be understood; the result of the taints should be understood; the cessation of the taints should be understood; the way leading to the cessation of the taints should be understood.

(5) "Kamma should be understood; the source and origin of kamma should be understood; the diversity of kamma should be understood; the result of kamma should be understood; the cessation of kamma should be understood; the way leading to the cessation of kamma should be understood. ${ }^{1410}$

(6) "Suffering should be understood; the source and origin of suffering should be understood; the diversity of suffering should be understood; the result of suffering should be understood; the cessation of suffering should be understood; the way leading to the cessation of suffering should be understood.

(1) "When it was said: 'Sensual pleasures should be understood; the source and origin of sensual pleasures should be understood; the diversity of sensual pleasures should be understood; the result [411] of sensual pleasures should be understood; the cessation of sensual pleasures should be understood;
the way leading to the cessation of sensual pleasures should be understood,' for what reason was this said?

"There are, bhikkhus, these five objects of sensual pleasure: forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensual pleasure, tantalizing; sounds cognizable by the ear . . . odors cognizable by the nose . . . tastes cognizable by the tongue . . . tactile objects cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensual pleasure, tantalizing. However, these are not sensual pleasures; in the Noble One's discipline, these are called 'objects of sensual pleasure.' A person's sensual pleasure is lustful intention. ${ }^{1411}$

"They are not sensual pleasures, the pretty things in the world:

a person's sensual pleasure is lustful intention;

the pretty things remain just as they are in the world, but the wise remove the desire for them.

"And what, bhikkhus, is the source and origin of sensual pleasures? Contact is their source and origin. ${ }^{1412}$

"And what is the diversity of sensual pleasures? Sensual desire for forms is one thing, sensual desire for sounds is another, sensual desire for odors still another, sensual desire for tastes still another, and sensual desire for tactile objects still another. This is called the diversity of sensual pleasures.

"And what is the result of sensual pleasures? One produces an individual existence that corresponds with whatever [sense pleasures] one desires and which may be the consequence either of merit or demerit. ${ }^{1413}$ This is called the result of sensual pleasures.

Since the Tathāgata... understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma, this too is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he . . . sets in motion the brahma wheel.

(6) "Again, with the destruction of the taints, the Tathāgata has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life,

possible as possible and the impossible as impossible is for one who is concentrated, not for one who lacks concentration.

This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed One's statement.

## 1 (1) Pleasing (1)

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, possessing seven qualities, a bhikkhu is displeasing and disagreeable to his fellow monks and is neither respected nor esteemed by them. What seven? Here, (1) a bhikkhu is desirous of gains, (2) honor, and (3) reputation; ${ }^{1455}$ (4) he is morally shameless and (5) morally reckless; (6) he has evil desires and (7) holds wrong view. Possessing these seven qualities, a bhikkhu is displeasing and disagreeable to his fellow monks and is neither respected nor esteemed by them.

"Bhikkhus, possessing seven qualities, a bhikkhu is pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and is respected and esteemed by them. What seven? [2] Here, (1) a bhikkhu is not desirous of gains, or (2) honor, or (3) a reputation; (4) he has a sense of moral shame and (5) moral dread; (6) he has few desires and (7) holds right view. Possessing these seven qualities, a bhikkhu is pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and is respected and esteemed by them."

2 (2) Pleasing (2)

"Bhikkhus, possessing seven qualities, a bhikkhu is displeasing and disagreeable to his fellow monks and is neither respected nor esteemed by them. What seven? Here, (1) a bhikkhu is desirous of gains, (2) honor, and (3) reputation; (4) he is morally shameless and (5) morally reckless; (6) he is envious and (7) miserly. Possessing these seven qualities, a bhikkhu is displeasing and disagreeable to his fellow monks and is neither respected nor esteemed by them.

"Bhikkhus, possessing seven qualities, a bhikkhu is pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and is respected and esteemed by them. What seven? Here, (1) a bhikkhu is not desirous of gains, (2) honor, (3) and reputation; (4) he has a sense of moral shame and (5) moral dread; (6) he is not envious and (7) is not miserly. Possessing these seven qualities, a bhikkhu is pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and is respected and esteemed by them." [3]

# 3 (3) Powers in Brief

"Bhikkhus, there are these seven powers. What seven? The power of faith, the power of energy, the power of moral shame, the power of moral dread, the power of mindfulness, the power of concentration, and the power of wisdom. These are the seven powers."

The power of faith, the power of energy, the powers of moral shame and moral dread; the powers of mindfulness and concentration, and wisdom, the seventh power; a powerful bhikkhu possessing these is wise and lives happily.

He should carefully examine the Dhamma and deeply see the meaning with wisdom.

Like the extinguishing of a lamp is the emancipation of the mind.

## 4 (4) Powers in Detail

"Bhikkhus, there are these seven powers. What seven? The power of faith, the power of energy, the power of moral shame,
the power of moral dread, the power of mindfulness, the power of concentration, and the power of wisdom.

(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the power of faith? Here, a noble disciple is endowed with faith. He places faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata thus: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' This is called the power of faith.

(2) "And what is the power of energy?.Here, a noble disciple has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities. This is called the power of energy.

(3) "And what is the power of moral shame? Here, a noble disciple has a sense of moral shame; he is ashamed of bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct; he is ashamed [4] of acquiring bad, unwholesome qualities. This is called the power of moral shame.

(4) "And what is the power of moral dread? Here, a noble disciple dreads wrongdoing; he dreads bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct; he dreads acquiring bad, unwholesome qualities. This is called the power of moral dread.

(5) "And what is the power of mindfulness? Here, a noble disciple is mindful, possessing supreme mindfulness and alertness, one who remembers and recollects what was done and said long ago. This is called the power of mindfulness.

(6) "And what is the power of concentration? Here, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a noble disciple enters and dwells in the first jhāna... [as in $5: 14 \S 4] \ldots$ the fourth jhāna. This is called the power of concentration.

(7) "And what is the power of wisdom? Here, a noble disciple is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. This is called the power of wisdom.

"These, bhikkhus, are the seven powers."

[The verses are identical with those of 7:3.]
