## Chapter One

### SN 6.1 The Appeal of the Divinity *Brahmāyācanasutta*

So I have heard. At one time, when he was first awakened,
the Buddha was staying in Uruvelā at the root of the
goatherd's banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.

Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, "This
principle I have discovered is deep, hard to see, hard to understand,
peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to
the astute. But people like clinging, they love it and enjoy it. It's
hard for them to see this topic; that is, specific conditionality,
dependent origination. It's also hard for them to see this topic; that
is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments,
the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment. And if I
were to teach this principle, others might not understand me, which
would be wearying and troublesome for me."

And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor
learned before in the past, occurred to the Buddha:

> "I've struggled hard to realize this,\
> enough with trying to explain it!\
> Those mired in greed and hate\
> can't really understand this teaching.
>
> It goes against the stream, subtle,\
> deep, obscure, and very fine.\
> Those besotted by greed cannot see,\
> for they're shrouded in a mass of darkness."

And as the Buddha reflected like this, his mind inclined to remaining
passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.

Then the divinity Sahampati, knowing the Buddha's train of thought,
thought, "Alas! The world will be lost, the world will perish! For the
mind of the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha,
inclines to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma."

Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm,
he vanished from the realm of divinity and reappeared in front of the
Buddha. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt with his right
knee on the ground, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:

"Sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach the
Dhamma! There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They're in
decline because they haven't heard the teaching. There will be those who
understand the teaching!"

This is what the divinity Sahampati said. Then he went on to say:

> "Among the Magadhans there appeared in the past\
> an impure teaching thought up by the stained.\
> Fling open the door to freedom from death!\
> Let them hear the teaching\
> － the immaculate one discovered.
>
> Standing high on a rocky mountain,\
> you can see the people all around.\
> In just the same way, All-seer, so intelligent,\
> having ascended the Temple of Truth,\
> rid of sorrow, look upon the people\
> swamped with sorrow,\
> － oppressed by rebirth and old age.
>
> Rise, hero! Victor in battle, leader of the caravan,\
> wander the world free of debt.\
> Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma!\
> There will be those who understand!"

Then the Buddha, understanding the Divinity's invitation, surveyed the
world with the eye of a Buddha, out of his compassion for sentient
beings. And the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in their
eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and
with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to
teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the
fault to do with the next world, while others did not.

It's like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some
of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving
underwater. Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the
water's surface. And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise
up above the water and stand with no water clinging to them.

In the same way, the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in
their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties
and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities,
easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the
danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not.

When he had seen this he replied in verse to the divinity Sahampati:

> "Flung open are the doors to freedom from death!\
> Let those with ears to hear commit to faith.\
> Thinking it would be troublesome, Divinity,\
> － I did not teach\
> the sophisticated, sublime Dhamma among humans."

Then the divinity Sahampati, knowing that his request for the Buddha to
teach the Dhamma had been granted, bowed and respectfully circled the
Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.

### SN 6.2 Respect *Gāravasutta*

So I have heard. At one time, when he was first awakened,
the Buddha was staying in Uruvelā at the root of the
goatherd's banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.

Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, "It's
unpleasant to live without respect and reverence. What ascetic or
brahmin should I honor and respect and rely on?"

Then it occurred to him:

"I'd honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to
complete the entire spectrum of ethics, if it were incomplete. But I
don't see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world---with its gods,
Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics
and brahmins, its gods and humans---who is more accomplished than myself
in ethics, who I should honor and respect and rely on.

I'd honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to
complete the entire spectrum of immersion, if it were incomplete. But I
don't see any other ascetic or brahmin ... who is more accomplished than
myself in immersion ...

I'd honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to
complete the entire spectrum of wisdom, if it were incomplete. But I
don't see any other ascetic or brahmin ... who is more accomplished than
myself in wisdom ...

I'd honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to
complete the entire spectrum of freedom, if it were incomplete. But I
don't see any other ascetic or brahmin ... who is more accomplished than
myself in freedom ...

I'd honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to
complete the entire spectrum of the knowledge and vision of freedom, if
it were incomplete. But I don't see any other ascetic or brahmin in this
world---with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this
population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans---who is
more accomplished than myself in the knowledge and vision of freedom,
who I should honor and respect and rely on. Why don't I honor and
respect and rely on the same Dhamma to which I was awakened?"

Then the divinity Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily
as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from
the realm of divinity and reappeared in front of the Buddha. He arranged
his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha,
and said:

"That's so true, Blessed One! That's so true, Holy One! All the
perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past honored
and respected and relied on this same teaching. All the perfected ones,
the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future will honor and
respect and rely on this same teaching. May the Blessed One, who is the
perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha at present, also honor and
respect and rely on this same teaching."

This is what the divinity Sahampati said. Then he went on to say:

> "All Buddhas in the past,\
> the Buddhas of the future,\
> and the Buddha at present---\
> destroyer of the sorrows of many---
>
> respecting the true teaching\
> they did live, they do live,\
> and they also will live.\
> This is the nature of the Buddhas.
>
> Therefore someone who cares for their own welfare,\
> and wants to become the very best they can be,\
> should respect the true teaching,\
> remembering the instructions of the Buddhas."

### SN 6.3 With Brahmadeva *Brahmadevasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery.

Now at that time a certain brahmin lady had a son called Brahmadeva, who
had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the
Buddha.

Then Venerable Brahmadeva, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and
resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this
very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for
which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.

He understood: "Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been
completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further
for this place." And Venerable Brahmadeva became one of the perfected.

Then Brahmadeva robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
entered Sāvatthī for alms. Wandering indiscriminately for
almsfood in Sāvatthī, he approached his own mother's home.

Now at that time Brahmadeva's mother, the brahmin lady, was offering up
a regular oblation to the Divinity.

Then the divinity Sahampati thought, "This Venerable Brahmadeva's
mother, the brahmin lady, offers up a regular oblation to the Divinity.
Why don't I go and stir up a sense of urgency in her?"

Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm,
he vanished from the realm of divinity and reappeared in the home of
Brahmadeva's mother. Then the divinity Sahampati, while standing in the
air, addressed Brahmadeva's mother in verse:

> "Far from here is the realm of divinity, madam,\
> to which you offer a regular oblation.\
> But the Divinity doesn't eat that kind of food.\
> Why pray, when you don't know the path to divinity?
>
> This Brahmadeva, madam,\
> free of attachments, has surpassed the gods.\
> Owning nothing, providing for no other,\
> － a mendicant\
> has entered your house for alms.
>
> He's worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods,\
> － a knowledge master, evolved.\
> He's worthy of a religious donation\
> － from gods and men.\
> Having banished all evils, he's unsullied.\
> Cool at heart, he wanders searching for food.
>
> He has no before and after,\
> peaceful, unclouded, untroubled,\
> － with no need for hope,\
> he has laid down the rod\
> － for all creatures firm and frail.\
> So let him enjoy your offering of choice alms.
>
> With peaceful mind, he has left the crowd,\
> he wanders like a tamed elephant, unperturbed.\
> He's a mendicant fair in ethics, with heart well freed.\
> So let him enjoy your offering of choice alms.
>
> With unwavering confidence in him,\
> present your religious donation\
> － to one who is worthy of it.\
> Now that you've seen the sage who has crossed over,\
> － madam,\
> make merit for the sake of future happiness!"
>
> With unwavering confidence in him,\
> she presented her religious donation\
> － to one who is worthy of it.\
> After seeing the sage who had crossed over,\
> － the brahmin lady\
> made merit for the sake of future happiness.

### SN 6.4 With Baka the Divinity *Bakabrahmasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery.

Now at that time Baka the Divinity had the following harmful
misconception: "This is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal,
this is whole, this is not liable to pass away. For this is where
there's no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being
reborn. And there's no other escape beyond this."

Then the Buddha knew what Baka the Divinity was thinking. As easily as a
strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from
Jeta's Grove and reappeared in that realm of divinity.

Baka the Divinity saw the Buddha coming off in the distance and said to
him, "Come, good fellow! Welcome, good fellow! It's been a long time
since you took the opportunity to come here. For this is permanent, this
is everlasting, this is eternal, this is complete, this is not liable to
pass away. For this is where there's no being born, growing old, dying,
passing away, or being reborn. And there's no other escape beyond this."

When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him, "Alas, Baka the Divinity is
lost in ignorance! Alas, Baka the Divinity is lost in ignorance! Because
what is actually impermanent, not lasting, transient, incomplete, and
liable to pass away, he says is permanent, everlasting, eternal,
complete, and not liable to pass away. And where there is being born,
growing old, dying, passing away, and being reborn, he says that there's
no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And
although there is another escape beyond this, he says that there's no
other escape beyond this."

> "Gotama, we seventy-two merit-makers\
> － are now wielders of power,\
> having passed beyond rebirth and old age.\
> This is our last rebirth as the Divinity,\
> － O knowledge master.\
> And now many people pray to us."
>
> "But, Baka, the lifespan here is short, not long,\
> though you think it's long.\
> I know that your lifespan\
> is two quinquadecillion years, Divinity."
>
> "Blessed One, I am the one of infinite vision,\
> who has gone beyond rebirth and old age and sorrow.\
> What precepts and observances\
> － did I practice in the past?\
> Explain to me so that I may understand."
>
> "You gave drink to many people\
> who were oppressed by thirst and heat.\
> They're the precepts and observances\
> － you practiced in the past.\
> I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep.
>
> When people at Deer River Bank were seized,\
> you released the captives as they were led away.\
> That's the precepts and observances\
> － you practiced in the past.\
> I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep.
>
> When a boat on the Ganges River was seized\
> by a fierce dragon desiring human flesh,\
> you freed it wielding mighty force.\
> That's the precepts and observances\
> － you practiced in the past.\
> I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep.
>
> I used to be your servant named Kappa.\
> You thought he was intelligent and loyal.\
> That's the precepts and observances\
> － you practiced in the past.\
> I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep."
>
> "You certainly understand this lifespan of mine.\
> And others, too, you know;\
> － that's why you're the Buddha.\
> And that's why your blazing glory\
> lights up even the realm of divinity."

### SN 6.5 A Certain Divinity *Aññatarabrahmasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time a certain divinity had the following harmful
misconception: "No ascetic or brahmin can come here!"

Then the Buddha knew what that divinity was thinking. As easily as a
strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from
Jeta's Grove and reappeared in that realm of divinity. Then the Buddha
sat cross-legged in the air above that Divinity, having entered upon the
fire element.

Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna thought, "Where is the Buddha
staying at present?" With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman,
he saw the Buddha seated cross-legged in the air above that Divinity,
having entered upon the fire element. Then, as easily as a strong person
would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from Jeta's Grove and
reappeared in that realm of divinity. Then
Mahāmoggallāna---positioning himself in the east, below the
Buddha---sat cross-legged in the air above that Divinity, having entered
upon the fire element.

Then Venerable Mahākassapa ... positioned himself in the
south ...

Venerable Mahākappina ... positioned himself in the west
...

Venerable Anuruddha ... positioned himself in the north, below the
Buddha, sitting cross-legged in the air above that Divinity, having
entered upon the fire element.

Then Mahāmoggallāna addressed that Divinity in verse:

> "Good sir, do you still have the same view\
> that you had in the past?\
> Or do you see the radiance\
> transcending the realm of divinity?"
>
> "Good fellow, I don't have that view\
> that I had in the past.\
> I see the radiance\
> transcending the realm of divinity.\
> So how could I say today\
> that I am permanent and eternal?"

Having inspired a sense of awe in the Divinity, as easily as a strong
person would extend or contract their arm, the Buddha vanished from the
realm of divinity and reappeared in Jeta's Grove.

Then that Divinity addressed a member of his retinue, "Please, good
fellow, go up to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna and say to him:
'Moggallāna my good fellow, are there any other disciples
of the Buddha who have power and might comparable to the worthies
Moggallāna, Kassapa, Kappina, and Anuruddha?'"

"Yes, good fellow," replied that retinue member. He went to
Moggallāna and asked as instructed.

Then Mahāmoggallāna addressed that member of the retinue of
Divinity in verse:

> "There are many disciples of the Buddha\
> who have the three knowledges,\
> and have attained psychic power,\
> － expert in reading minds,\
> they're perfected ones with defilements ended."

Then that member of the retinue of Divinity, having approved and agreed
with what Mahāmoggallāna said, went to that Divinity and
said to him, "Good fellow, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said
this:

> 'There are many disciples of the Buddha\
> who have the three knowledges,\
> and have attained psychic power,\
> － expert in reading minds,\
> they're perfected ones with defilements ended.'"

That's what that member of the retinue of Divinity said. Satisfied, that
Divinity approved what the member of his retinue said.

<!--pg-->
### SN 6.6 The Negligent Divinity *Brahmalokasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time the Buddha had gone into retreat for the day's
meditation.

Then the independent divinities Subrahmā and
Suddhāvāsa went to the Buddha and stationed themselves one
by each door-post. But Subrahmā said to
Suddhāvāsa, "Good fellow, it's the wrong time to pay homage
to the Buddha. He has gone into retreat for the day's meditation. But
such and such realm of divinity is successful and prosperous, while the
divinity living there is negligent. Come, let's go to that realm of
divinity and inspire awe in that Divinity!"

"Yes, good fellow," replied Suddhāvāsa.

Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm,
they vanished from in front of the Buddha and appeared in that realm of
divinity.

That divinity saw those divinities coming off in the distance and said
to them, "Well now, good fellows, where have you come from?"

"Good fellow, we've come from the presence of the Blessed One, the
perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. Shouldn't you go to attend on
that Blessed One?"

When they had spoken, that divinity refused to accept their advice. He
multiplied himself a thousand times and said to Subrahmā,
"Good fellow, can't you see that I have such psychic power?"

"I see that, good fellow."

"Since I have such psychic power and might, what other ascetic or
brahmin should I go to and attend upon?"

Then Subrahmā multiplied himself two thousand times and
said to that Divinity, "Good fellow, can't you see that I have such
psychic power?"

"I see that, good fellow."

"That Buddha has even more psychic power and might than you or me.
Shouldn't you go to attend on that Blessed One?"

Then that divinity addressed Subrahmā in verse:

> "There are three hundreds of phoenixes,\
> － four of swans, and five of eagles.\
> This palace belongs to him who practiced absorption.\
> It shines, Divinity,\
> lighting up the northern quarter!"
>
> "So what if your palace shines,\
> lighting up the northern quarter?\
> A clever person who has seen the deficiency in form,\
> its chronic trembling, takes no pleasure in it."

Then after inspiring awe in that divinity, the independent divinities
Subrahmā and Suddhāvāsa vanished right there.
And after some time that divinity went to attend on the Buddha.

<!--pg-->
### SN 6.7 About Kokālika *Kokālikasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time the Buddha had gone into retreat for the day's
meditation. Then the independent divinities Subrahmā and
Suddhāvāsa went to the Buddha and stationed themselves one
by each door-post.

Then Subrahmā recited this verse about the mendicant
Kokālika in the Buddha's presence:

> "What wise person here would judge\
> the immeasurable by measuring them?\
> I think anyone who'd do such a thing\
> must be an ordinary person, shrouded in darkness."

<!--pg-->
### SN 6.8 About Katamorakatissaka *Katamodakatissasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time the Buddha had gone into retreat for the day's
meditation. Then the independent divinities Subrahmā and
Suddhāvāsa went to the Buddha and stationed themselves one
by each door-post.

Then Suddhāvāsa recited this verse about the mendicant
Katamorakatissaka in the Buddha's presence:

> "What wise person here would judge\
> the immeasurable by measuring them?\
> I think anyone who'd do such a thing\
> must be a fool, shrouded in darkness."

<!--pg-->
### SN 6.9 With the Divinity Tudu *Turūbrahmasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time the mendicant Kokālika was sick,
suffering, gravely ill.

Then, late at night, the beautiful independent divinity Tudu, lighting
up the entire Jeta's Grove, went up to the mendicant
Kokālika, and standing in the air he said to him,
"Kokālika, have confidence in Sāriputta and
Moggallāna, they're good monks."

"Who are you, reverend?"

"I am Tudu the independent divinity."

"Didn't the Buddha declare you a non-returner? So what exactly are you
doing back here? See how far you have strayed!"

> "A man is born\
> with an axe in his mouth.\
> A fool cuts themselves with it\
> when they say bad words.
>
> When you praise someone worthy of criticism,\
> or criticize someone worthy of praise,\
> you choose bad luck with your own mouth:\
> you'll never find happiness that way.
>
> Bad luck at dice is a trivial thing,\
> if all you lose is your money\
> and all you own, even yourself.\
> What's really terrible luck\
> is to hate the holy ones.
>
> For more than two quinquadecillion years,\
> and another five quattuordecillion years,\
> a slanderer of noble ones goes to hell,\
> having aimed bad words and thoughts at them."

<!--pg-->
### SN 6.10 With Kokālika *Kokālikasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then the mendicant Kokālika went up to the Buddha, bowed,
sat down to one side, and said to him, "Sir, Sāriputta and
Moggallāna have corrupt wishes. They've fallen under the
sway of corrupt wishes."

When this was said, the Buddha said to Kokālika, "Don't say
that, Kokālika! Don't say that, Kokālika! Have
confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna,
they're good monks."

For a second time Kokālika said to the Buddha, "Despite my
faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and
Moggallāna have corrupt wishes. They've fallen under the
sway of corrupt wishes."

For a second time, the Buddha said to Kokālika, "Don't say
that, Kokālika! Don't say that, Kokālika! Have
confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna,
they're good monks."

For a third time Kokālika said to the Buddha, "Despite my
faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and
Moggallāna have corrupt wishes. They've fallen under the
sway of corrupt wishes."

For a third time, the Buddha said to Kokālika, "Don't say
that, Kokālika! Don't say that, Kokālika! Have
confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna,
they're good monks."

Then Kokālika got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully
circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. Not long
after he left his body erupted with boils the size of mustard seeds. The
boils grew to the size of mung beans, then chickpeas, then jujube seeds,
then jujubes, then myrobalans, then unripe wood-apples, then ripe
wood-apples. Finally they burst open, and pus and blood oozed out. Then
the mendicant Kokālika died of that illness. He was reborn
in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for
Sāriputta and Moggallāna.

Then, late at night, the beautiful divinity Sahampati, lighting up the
entire Jeta's Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side,
and said to him, "Sir, the mendicant Kokālika has passed
away. He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for
Sāriputta and Moggallāna."

That's what the divinity Sahampati said. Then he bowed and respectfully
circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing
right there.

Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that
had happened.

When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha, "Sir, how
long is the lifespan in the Pink Lotus hell?"

"It's long, mendicant. It's not easy to calculate how many years, how
many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it lasts."

"But sir, is it possible to give a simile?"

"It's possible," said the Buddha.

"Suppose there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed.
And at the end of every hundred years someone would remove a single seed
from it. By this means the Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame
seed would run out faster than a single lifetime in the Abbuda hell.

Now, twenty lifetimes in the Abbuda hell equal one lifetime in the
Nirabbuda hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Nirabbuda hell equal one
lifetime in the Ababa hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Ababa hell equal one
lifetime in the Aṭaṭa hell. Twenty lifetimes in the
Aṭaṭa hell equal one lifetime in the Ahaha hell. Twenty
lifetimes in the Ahaha hell equal one lifetime in the Yellow Lotus hell.
Twenty lifetimes in the Yellow Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the
Sweet-Smelling hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Sweet-Smelling hell equal
one lifetime in the Blue Water Lily hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Blue
Water Lily hell equal one lifetime in the White Lotus hell. Twenty
lifetimes in the White Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Pink Lotus
hell.

The mendicant Kokālika has been reborn in the Pink Lotus
hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and
Moggallāna."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "A man is born\
> with an axe in his mouth.\
> A fool cuts themselves with it\
> when they say bad words.
>
> When you praise someone worthy of criticism,\
> or criticize someone worthy of praise,\
> you choose bad luck with your own mouth:\
> you'll never find happiness that way.
>
> Bad luck at dice is a trivial thing,\
> if all you lose is your money\
> and all you own, even yourself.\
> What's really terrible luck\
> is to hate the holy ones.
>
> For more than two quinquadecillion years,\
> and another five quattuordecillion years,\
> a slanderer of noble ones goes to hell,\
> having aimed bad words and thoughts at them."

## Chapter Two

### SN 6.11 With Sanaṅkumāra *Sanaṅkumārasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, on the bank of the Sappinī river.

Then, late at night, the beautiful divinity Sanaṅkumāra,
lighting up the entire Sappinī riverbank, went up to the
Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and recited this verse in the Buddha's
presence:

> "The aristocrat is best among people\
> who take clan as the standard.\
> But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct\
> is best among gods and humans."

That's what the divinity Sanaṅkumāra said, and the teacher
approved. Then the divinity Sanaṅkumāra, knowing that the
teacher approved, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him
on his right, before vanishing right there.

<!--pg-->
### SN 6.12 About Devadatta *Devadattasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, on the Vulture's Peak Mountain, not long after
Devadatta had left.

Then, late at night, the beautiful divinity Sahampati, lighting up the
entire Vulture's Peak, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side,
and recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "The banana tree is destroyed by its own fruit,\
> as are the bamboo and the reed.\
> Honor destroys a sinner,\
> as pregnancy destroys a mule."

<!--pg-->
### SN 6.13 At Andhakavinda *Andhakavindasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans at
Andhakavinda.

Now at that time the Buddha was meditating in the open during the dark
of night, while a gentle rain drizzled down.

Then, late at night, the beautiful divinity Sahampati, lighting up the
entirety of Andhakavinda, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one
side, and recited these verses in the Buddha's presence:

> "One should frequent secluded lodgings,\
> and practice to be released from fetters.\
> If you don't find enjoyment there,\
> live in the Saṅgha, guarded and mindful.
>
> Walking for alms from family to family,\
> with senses guarded, alert and mindful.\
> One should frequent secluded lodgings,\
> free of fear, freed in the fearless.
>
> Where dreadful serpents slither,\
> where the lightning flashes and the heavens thunder\
> in the dark of the night;\
> there meditates a mendicant, free of goosebumps.
>
> For this is ever seen by me,\
> it isn't just what the testament says.\
> Within a single spiritual dispensation\

### SN 6.14 About Aruṇavatī *Aruṇavatīsutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī. There he addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a king named
Aruṇavā. He had a capital named Aruṇavatī.
Sikhī the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully
awakened Buddha lived supported by Aruṇavatī.
Sikhī had a fine pair of chief disciples named
Abhibhū and Sambhava.

Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant
Abhibhū, 'Come, brahmin, let's go to one of the realms of
divinity until it's time for our meal.'

'Yes, sir,' replied Abhibhū. Then, as easily as a strong
person would extend or contract their arm, they vanished from
Aruṇavatī and appeared in that realm of divinity.

Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant
Abhibhū, 'Brahmin, teach the Dhamma as you feel inspired
for that Divinity, his assembly, and the members of his retinue.'

'Yes, sir,' replied Abhibhū. Then he educated, encouraged,
fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk.

But the Divinity, his assembly, and his retinue complained, grumbled,
and objected, 'Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing! How on earth can a
disciple teach Dhamma in the presence of the Teacher?'

Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant
Abhibhū, 'Brahmin, the Divinity, his assembly, and his
retinue are complaining that a disciple teaches Dhamma in the presence
of the Teacher. Well then, brahmin, stir them up even more!'

'Yes, sir,' replied Abhibhū. Then he taught Dhamma with his
body visible; with his body invisible; with the lower half visible and
the upper half invisible; and with the upper half visible and the lower
half invisible.

And the Divinity, his assembly, and his retinue, their minds full of
wonder and amazement, thought, 'Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!
The ascetic has such psychic power and might!'

Then Abhibhū said to the Buddha Sikhī, 'Sir, I
recall having said this in the middle of the Saṅgha:
"Standing in the realm of divinity, I can make my voice heard throughout
the thousandfold galaxy."'

'Now is the time, brahmin! Now is the time, brahmin! Standing in the
realm of divinity, make your voice heard throughout the thousandfold
galaxy.'

'Yes, sir,' replied Abhibhū. Standing in the realm of
divinity, he recited this verse:

> 'Rouse yourselves! Try harder!\
> Devote yourselves to the teachings of the Buddha!\
> Crush the army of Death,\
> as an elephant a hut of reeds.
>
> Whoever shall meditate diligently\
> in this teaching and training,\
> giving up transmigration through rebirths,\
> will make an end of suffering.'

Having inspired that Divinity, his assembly, and his retinue with a
sense of awe, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract
their arm, Sikhī and Abhibhū vanished from
that realm of divinity and appeared in Aruṇavatī.

Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicants,
'Mendicants, did you hear the mendicant Abhibhū speaking a
verse while standing in a realm of divinity?'

'We did, sir.'

'But what exactly did you hear?'

'This is what we heard, sir:

> "Rouse yourselves! Try harder!\
> Devote yourselves to the teachings of the Buddha!\
> Crush the army of Death,\
> as an elephant a hut of reeds.
>
> Whoever shall meditate diligently\
> in this teaching and training,\
> giving up transmigration through rebirths,\
> will make an end of suffering."

That's what we heard, sir.'

'Good, good, mendicants! It's good that you heard the mendicant
Abhibhū speaking this verse while standing in a realm of
divinity.'"

That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants approved what
the Buddha said.

### SN 6.15 Full Extinguishment *Parinibbānasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying between a pair of sal trees in the
sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near Kusinārā at the
time of his full extinguishment.

Then the Buddha said to the mendicants: "Come now, mendicants, I say to
you all: 'Conditions fall apart. Persist with diligence.'"

These were the Realized One's last words.

Then the Buddha entered the first absorption. Emerging from that, he
entered the second absorption. Emerging from that, he successively
entered into and emerged from the third absorption, the fourth
absorption, the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite
consciousness, the dimension of nothingness, and the dimension of
neither perception nor non-perception. Then he entered the cessation of
perception and feeling.

Then he emerged from the cessation of perception and feeling and entered
the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Emerging from
that, he successively entered into and emerged from the dimension of
nothingness, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of
infinite space, the fourth absorption, the third absorption, the second
absorption, and the first absorption. Emerging from that, he
successively entered into and emerged from the second absorption and the
third absorption. Then he entered the fourth absorption. Emerging from
that the Buddha immediately became fully extinguished.

When the Buddha was fully quenched, along with the full extinguishment,
the divinity Sahampati recited this verse:

> "All creatures in this world\
> must lay down this bag of bones.\
> For even a Teacher such as this,\
> unrivaled in the world,\
> the Realized One, attained to power,\
> the Buddha was fully quenched."

When the Buddha was fully quenched, Sakka, lord of gods, recited this
verse:

> "Oh! Conditions are impermanent,\
> their nature is to rise and fall;\
> having arisen, they cease;\
> their stilling is blissful."

When the Buddha was fully quenched, Venerable Ānanda recited this verse:

> "Then there was terror!\
> Then they had goosebumps!\
> When the Buddha, endowed with all fine qualities,\
> was fully quenched."

When the Buddha was fully quenched, Venerable Anuruddha recited this
verse:

> "There was no more breathing\
> for the unaffected one of steady heart.\
> Imperturbable, committed to peace,\
> the Clear-eyed One was fully quenched.
>
> He put up with painful feelings\
> without flinching.\
> The liberation of his heart\
> was like the extinguishing of a lamp."
