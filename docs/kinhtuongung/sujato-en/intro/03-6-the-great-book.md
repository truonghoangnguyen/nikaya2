# The Great Book

The "Great Book" is the last and largest of the five books of the Linked
Discourses. It consists of twelve *saṁyuttas*, almost all
of which deal with an aspect of Buddhist practice, or the path. The
first of these, indeed, is the "Section on the Path" (*Magga
Saṁyutta*), and in the northern canons the book as a whole
is referred to as the "Book of the Path" (*Maggavagga*).

The first seven *saṁyuttas* offer a detailed treatment of
seven sets of factors on Buddhist practice. These sets came to be known
to the later traditions as the 37 *bodhipakkhiyā
dhammā*, or "qualities leading to awakening". Note that
this term is not used in this way in the suttas; it is, rather, applied
to one of the sets, the five faculties ([SN
48\.55](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.55), etc.). While the 37 factors
are mentioned throughout the canon, it is in this book that we find the
primary source for these teachings. Subsequent *saṁyuttas*
deal with the path from different perspectives, while the final two deal
with stream-entry and the four noble truths respectively.

While most books of the Saṁyutta are dominated by one major
collection, the Great Book features several *saṁyuttas* of
comparable importance. For this reason, I will briefly discuss most of
the substantive *saṁyuttas*. I leave aside those that are
merely sets of template repetitions, and also the final two
*saṁyuttas* on stream entry and the truths, as I have
covered these topics elsewhere. I preface the discussion of the
individual *saṁyuttas* with a general discussion of the
"qualities leading to awakening".

The *saṁyuttas* in the Great Book display considerable
complexity in their structure and use of repetitions. But for fear of
overburdening the discussion, I refer anyone interested to the relevant
sections of Ven Bodhi's *Connected Discourses*.

### The 37 Qualities Leading to Awakening

For the early Buddhist texts, the primary concern was the spiritual
practice that leads to the escape from suffering. This is the fourth
noble truth. From the very first discourse, this was spelled out by a
specific set of factors comprising the path to awakening: the noble
eightfold path. During his long teaching career, the Buddha presented
this path in many different ways, formally or informally, briefly or in
detail, emphasizing different aspects to suit the occasion or the
person.

Before his death, it seems, the Buddha had begun to systematize these
various presentations, putting together seven sets of qualities
pertaining to the path, totaling 37 factors. Each set presented the path
to liberation from a slightly different perspective.

The seven primary *saṁyuttas* of the Mahāvagga
contain the same teachings, albeit in a different sequence. The
Mahāvagga begins with the noble eightfold path, due to its
prestige and importance as *the* teaching on the path. But when
presented elsewhere in the suttas we find the sets arranged numerically.

- Four kinds of mindfulness meditation. The observation of:

  1.  body

  2.  feelings

  3.  mind

  4.  principles

- Four right efforts:

  1.  to prevent the bad

  2.  to give up the bad

  3.  to give rise to the good

  4.  to maintain and grow the good

- Four bases of psychic power:

  1.  enthusiasm

  2.  energy

  3.  mind

  4.  inquiry

- Five faculties:

  1.  faith

  1.  faith

  2.  energy

  3.  mindfulness

  4.  immersion

  5.  wisdom

- Seven factors of awakening:

  1.  mindfulness

  2.  investigation of principles

  3.  energy

  4.  rapture

  5.  tranquility

  6.  immersion

  7.  equanimity

- Noble eightfold path:

  1.  right view

  2.  right thought

  3.  right speech

  4.  right action

  5.  right livelihood

  6.  right effort

  7.  right mindfulness

  8.  right immersion

A cursory glance at the Pali texts shows how influential and widespread
this set of 37 qualities was. It appears in each of the four
*nikāyas* ([DN 28](https://suttacentral.net/dn28), [DN
29](https://suttacentral.net/dn29), [DN
16](https://suttacentral.net/dn16), [MN
103](https://suttacentral.net/mn103), [MN
104](https://suttacentral.net/mn104), [SN
22\.81](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.81), [SN
22\.101](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.101), [SN
43\.12](https://suttacentral.net/sn43.12), [AN
8\.19](https://suttacentral.net/an8.19)) as well as the
Udāna ([Ud 5.5](https://suttacentral.net/ud5.5)). It is one
of the few doctrinal teachings to be mentioned several times in the
Vinaya ([Pj 4](https://suttacentral.net/pj4), [Pc
8](https://suttacentral.net/pc8), [Kd
19](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd19)). It occurs constantly in the
late canonical texts of the Khuddaka ([Ne
8](https://suttacentral.net/ne8), [Cnd
12](https://suttacentral.net/cnd12), [Cnd
15](https://suttacentral.net/cnd15), [Cnd

1\.5](https://suttacentral.net/ps1.5), [Ps
2\.8](https://suttacentral.net/ps2.8), [Ps
2\.9](https://suttacentral.net/ps2.9), [Mil
3\.1.13](https://suttacentral.net/mil3.1.13), [Mil
6\.4.1](https://suttacentral.net/mil6.4.1), [Mil
6\.4.2](https://suttacentral.net/mil6.4.2), etc.) as well as the
Abhidhamma ([Vb 17](https://suttacentral.net/vb17), [Dt
1\.2](https://suttacentral.net/Dt1.2), [Dt
2\.1](https://suttacentral.net/Dt2.1), [Dt
2\.6](https://suttacentral.net/Dt2.6), [Kv
4\.3](https://suttacentral.net/kv4.3), [Kv
12\.5](https://suttacentral.net/kv12.5), [Kv
14\.9](https://suttacentral.net/kv14.9), [Kv
15\.6](https://suttacentral.net/kv15.6), [Kv
21\.1](https://suttacentral.net/kv21.1), [Kv
21\.5](https://suttacentral.net/kv21.5), etc.).

But its influence was not to stop there, for it remained a central
doctrinal principle in later forms of Buddhism. In the
Mahāyāna, for example, the same 37 qualities came to be
known as the "37 practices of the Bodhisattva".

The Buddha declared that these teachings emerged from his direct
knowledge. They are factors of practice, to be developed and experienced
by those on the spiritual journey. However, from their earliest
appearances, they were also treated as teachings to be learned,
memorized, and recited. From [DN 29](https://suttacentral.net/dn29):

> You should all come together and recite in concert, without disputing,
> those things I have taught you from my direct knowledge, comparing
> meaning with meaning and phrasing with phrasing, so that this
> spiritual path may last for a long time.

Such passages place the 37 factors at the heart of the Buddha's
scriptural legacy. But what, exactly, was to be recited? Surely such
momentous teaching must have entailed something more than simply listing
the factors. There must have been an agreed-upon body of texts, a canon
of scripture recited in unity by the early community. And what could
that have been if not these very teachings, the collected discourses on
the factors of the path found today in the Mahāvagga? This
is not to deny that expansion and elaboration of these have occurred,
but the core teachings of the Mahāvagga were, in all
probability, the heart of the scriptures for the earliest Buddhists.

Certain of the sets focus on a specific area, such as mindfulness or
effort, while others have a more overall view, such as the noble
eightfold path. Nevertheless, they are deeply interconnected, with the
same factors recurring in multiple sets. Overall, they strongly
emphasize meditation, although other dimensions of spiritual practice,
such as ethics and study, are also found. Here is a brief overview of
the general distinctions in perspective between the groups. Note that
the first three sets loosely correspond to the final three factors of
the noble eightfold path: right effort, right mindfulness, and right
immersion.

Four kinds of mindfulness meditation

:   The practice of undertaking meditation leading to serenity and
    insight.

Four right efforts

:   The putting forth of effort in mental cultivation.

Four bases of psychic power

:   Development of deep immersion leading to various extraordinary
    abilities.

Five faculties

:   The mental qualities that lead to liberation, and which characterize
    the mind of one on the path.

Five powers

:   The same as the faculties.

Seven factors of awakening

:   Retention and investigation of teachings lead to the progressive
    deepening of the emotional qualities that ripen in liberation.

Noble eightfold path

:   The broadest in scope of the sets and the only one to explicitly
    mention ethics.

As is common in the suttas, these sets sometimes refer to similar
qualities with different terms. The quality of wisdom, for example, is
called "observation of principles" (*dhamānupassanā*) as
the fourth kind of mindfulness meditation, "inquiry"
(*vīmaṁsa*) in the bases for psychic power, "wisdom"
(*paññā*) in the faculties and powers, "investigation of
principles" (*dhammavicaya*) in the factors of awakening, and "right
view" (*sammādiṭṭhi*) in the noble eightfold path. The
relations between all these terms are analyzed in detail in the
Abhidhamma and commentarial texts.

Bear in mind, though, that each context has its own integrity, its
specific purpose and orientation, and the choice of different terms is
by no means arbitrary. "Right view", being placed at the *start* of the
path, emphasizes the theoretical understanding gained by hearing the
teaching. "Investigation of principles", similarly located near the
beginning, refers to the reflection and inquiry into these teachings as
realized in oneself. "Observation of principles" and "inquiry" occur
after the development of deep stillness in absorption meditation and
refer to the inquiry and investigation into the nature of that
experience, and the meditative processes and conditions that shape such
profound experiences. And "wisdom", the culmination of all these, is the
realization of the four noble truths, the liberating insight of the
stream-enterer. So when considered on their own, as distinct mental
factors, they can be regarded as synonyms. But their true depth is
realized only by understanding the role they play in their context.

When surveying these teachings and reflecting on them as a spiritual
path, there is something rather odd about them. They appear quite
different from the practices that one normally considers to be
"religious". Where are the rituals? The sacrifice? The devotion to
deity? The allegiance to an institution? The symbols, rites, and
mythology? These things are starkly, dramatically absent. To be sure,
some such things may be found, in one form or another, elsewhere in the
canon, and more so in later Buddhist traditions. But here, in the
teachings regarded by the Buddha himself as his core message and
practice, we find only balanced and reasoned development of behavior,
emotions, and intellect. It is an integrated and rational path, one that
does not depend on cultural or historical specifics, but on universal
human qualities. The factors that lead to awakening, all 37 of them, are
things that every human may find within themselves. In pointing to these
qualities, the Buddha was pointing to the spiritual potential of all
beings and offering us the means to grow and develop the best parts of
ourselves.

### SN 45: Linked Discourses on the Path

The noble eightfold path was famously declared to be the "middle way" in
the Buddha's very first teaching ([SN
56\.11](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11)). It covers the entire
spiritual path ([SN 45.6](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.6), [SN
45\.19](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.19), [SN
45\.20](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.20)), beginning with the
acquisition of right view as the starting point ([SN
45\.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.1)), and leading to deep meditative
immersion as the immediate precursor to the realization of the four
noble truths.

The noble eightfold path is said to be a "divine vehicle" which carries
us to awakening, its factors compared to the parts of a chariot ([SN
45\.4](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.4)). Practicing it leads to the end
of suffering ([SN 45.5](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.5)), but only if
it begins with right view, else it will lead to harming oneself ([SN
45\.9](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.9)).

The factors are defined at [SN 45.8](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.8),
as well as several other places in the canon.

Right view (*sammādiṭṭhi*)

:   Understanding the four noble truths.

Right thought (*sammāsaṅkappa*)

:   Thoughts of letting go, love, and kindness.

Right speech (*sammāvācā*)

:   Speech that is true, harmonious, gentle, and meaningful.

Right action (*sammākammanta*)

:   Avoiding killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct.

Right livelihood (*sammāājīva*)

:   Avoiding harmful livelihood.

Right effort (*sammāvāyāma*)

:   The four right efforts.

Right mindfulness (*sammāsati*)

:   The four kinds of mindfulness meditation.

Right immersion (*sammāsamādhi*)

:   The four absorptions.

The eight factors have a clear progressive aspect, as made clear from
the beginning of this collection ([SN
45\.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.1)). They follow the same general
course that is spelled out in the Gradual Training, though with less
emphasis on the monastic life, as both renunciates and lay folk should
practice them ([SN 45.24](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.24)). One hears
the teaching and gains an initial understanding (right view). Then one
determines to live following this (right thought), undertaking the
essentials of ethical conduct in speech (right speech) and body (right
action), and ensuring that one does not earn money in a manner that
causes harm (right livelihood). With this foundation one makes an effort
to purify the mind (right effort), undertaking meditation (right
mindfulness) leading to deep absorption (right immersion) ([SN
45\.28](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.28)).

When all these factors have been fulfilled, the mind is ready to make
the breakthrough to the realization of the four noble truths. In this
way the understanding of four noble truths, beginning as a concept
accepted on faith, gradually deepens throughout the spiritual journey,
nourished by experience and reflection. Right view guides us on each
step of the path, learning from mistakes, revealing our hidden
motivations, and uncovering unexpected possibilities. Ultimately it
transforms into the liberating insight of the noble ones ([SN
45\.13](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.13), [SN
45\.35](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.35), etc.). The key to this
transformation is the brilliant clarity and stillness of meditative
absorption, a higher consciousness that sees further and deeper than
ever before, and which has the power to completely eradicate greed,
hate, and delusion ([SN 45.36](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.36), etc.).

Nevertheless, despite this progression, it is not the case that the
factors are to be undertaken in a literal one-at-a-time fashion. The
"path" is only a metaphor, and in real life, spiritual development is
more complex.

The factors of the path are best seen as providing a framework for
reflecting on and if necessary changing one's own life and practice.
Each of these factors is essential, and if you find yourself missing out
on higher factors, try asking whether you've put enough work into the
basics. Sometimes people seem enthusiastic to get to the higher states
of consciousness, without laying the broad and secure foundations
offered by the simpler factors of the path. If developing deep
meditation is proving difficult, then the answer is not to try to force
it to ripen quicker, nor, worse, to explain it away as being somehow
unnecessary. Rather, pay closer attention to improving right view
through study and discussion of Dhamma; to developing right thought by
becoming more generous and open-hearted; or to being more careful in
one's ethical and business conduct ([SN
45\.50--54](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.50)).

And remember, this path is not walked alone. For all the emphasis on
solitary meditation, this *saṁyutta* reminds us that good
friendship is the whole of the spiritual life ([SN
45\.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.2), [SN
45\.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.3)), for good friendship precedes
the noble eightfold path ([SN 45.49](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.49)).

<!--pg-->
### SN 46: Linked Discourses on the Awakening Factors

These seven factors are called the "awakening factors"
(*bojjaṅga*, i.e. *bodhi* + *aṅga*) because
they lead to awakening ([SN 46.5](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.5), [SN
46\.21](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.21)). Of themselves, they focus on
the psychology of contemplation, but the *saṁyutta* makes
it clear from the start that, like all presentations of the path, they
rest on ethics ([SN 46.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.1)).

Unlike the factors of the path, there is no explicit definition.
Nevertheless, we should of course interpret these factors in the same
way as they occur in the eightfold path and elsewhere. However, there
are some new factors, as well as a few places that offer a new
perspective on some familiar factors. Most of the following details come
from [SN 46.52](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.52).

Mindfulness (*sati*)

:   Includes both the recollection of teachings ([SN
    46.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.3)) as well as mindful awareness
    of phenomena internal and external.

Investigation of principles (*dhammavicaya*)

:   Includes both reflection and investigation of the teachings ([SN
    46.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.3)) as well as investigation
    into phenomena internal and external.

Energy (*viriya*)

:   Both mental and physical.

Rapture (*pīti*)

:   This is the experience of uplifting joy that emerges as the mind
    becomes peaceful in meditation. It includes the rapture of the first
    and second absorptions.

Tranquility (*passadhi*)

:   Both physical and mental

Immersion (*samādhi*)

:   The absorptions.

Equanimity (*upekkhā*)

:   This may be both the equanimity of the higher states of immersion as
    well as that of deep insight.

One detail of the preceding probably needs further explanation; that is,
the idea that mindfulness includes recollection of the teachings.
Mindfulness is defined throughout the suttas as the ability to recollect
things that were said and done long ago ([DN
33](https://suttacentral.net/dn33), [DN
34](https://suttacentral.net/dn34), [MN
53](https://suttacentral.net/mn53), [SN
48\.9](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.9), [SN
48\.50](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.50), [AN
4\.35](https://suttacentral.net/an4.35), [AN
8\.13](https://suttacentral.net/an8.13), [AN
10\.17](https://suttacentral.net/an10.17), etc.). The root meaning of the
word *sati* is in fact "memory" and in the Brahmanical traditions it
refers to the memorized scriptures. But of course today we understand
mindfulness as "clear awareness" of phenomena in the present.

This *saṁyutta* offers a clue that helps resolve these two
senses. In [SN 46.56](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.56), a brahmin asks
the Buddha why he can sometimes remember his chanting and sometimes
cannot. The Buddha explains that the presence of the hindrances obscures
his memory, giving an elaborate series of similes comparing water in
various states with the various hindrances. How, we might wonder, does a
reciter of oral texts achieve this? *By maintaining continued and clear
focus during the act of recitation*. When the mind wanders and gets
distracted, the recitation is lost. *Sati* does not mean the
unstructured memories that happen to come to mind, but the steady flow
and continuity of consciously focused awareness. And in this way, the
act of recollecting scriptures suddenly seems a lot like keeping
attention on one's meditation.

The factors are sequential, with each serving as condition or fuel for
the next ([SN 46.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.3)). Multiple suttas
stress this aspect of conditionality. Each of the awakening factors is
nourished by a specific kind of fuel ([SN
46\.51](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.51)). The set as a whole emerges
from the practice of the four kinds of mindfulness meditation and the
series of practices that underlie them ([SN
45\.6](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.6)). They affect and condition the
mind in distinct ways; thus when the mind is tired, it's best to develop
investigation, energy, and rapture, but when restless, develop
tranquility, immersion, and equanimity. But mindfulness is always useful
([SN 46.53](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.53)). And the factors
themselves are the condition for awakening ([SN
46\.56](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.56)).

Nevertheless, even the perfected ones continue to practice them, donning
any one of them whenever they wish, like a garment ([SN
46\.4](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.4)). Such a one has "acquired the
path" and understands the true power of the awakening factors to lead to
the end of rebirth ([SN 46.30](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.30)).

The *saṁyutta* repeatedly opposes the awakening factors
with their dark counterparts, the five hindrances of sensual desire, ill
will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt.
These are compared to corruptions in gold ([SN
46\.33](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.33)) or to parasites ([SN
46\.39](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.39)).

A unique aspect of the awakening factors is that their recitation is
said to be effective in helping cure disease. Several suttas speak of
how a sick monk---and even the Buddha himself---becomes inspired by
hearing them recited and rises cured ([SN
46\.14--16](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.14)). Understandably, this has
ensured that reciting passages on the awakening factors for sick people
remains popular in Theravadin culture. If such recitation seems less
effective today than in the suttas, it should be borne in mind that
these are cases of advanced and experienced meditators, perfected ones
indeed, who had already developed these factors to completion. Their
inspiration is on a different level than that of an ordinary person. And
even so, there is no guarantee: there are plenty of cases in the early
texts where perfected ones fall ill with no cure.

Most of the awakening factors refer to the emotional aspects of the
spiritual path, the joy and peace of meditation. This is further
emphasized in [SN 46.54](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.54), which
connects the awakening factors with the four immeasurables or divine
meditations---love, compassion, rejoicing, and equanimity. The Buddhist
mendicants are challenged by followers of other paths, who say that they
too teach the development of these things. The Buddha points out,
however, that he describes *how* to develop these things to their
fullest potential. And to do this the immeasurables are empowered by the
awakening factors.

### SN 47: Linked Discourses on Mindfulness Meditation

The Pali term *satipaṭṭhāna* means the "establishing of
mindfulness". I usually render it more colloquially as simply
"mindfulness meditation". While elsewhere *sati* is defined as "memory",
here it is described as *anupassanā*, "sustained
observation". It refers to the meditative practice of setting up and
maintaining continued and unbroken awareness in four distinct arenas:

Body (*kāya*)

:   Any aspect of the physical, including the breath, the postures,
    parts of the body, and so on.

Feelings (*vedanā*)

:   Different kinds of feeling, whether painful, pleasurable, or
    neutral, spiritual or carnal.

Mind (*citta*)

:   States of awareness, whether under the influence of greed, hate, and
    delusion, or free of such.

Principles (*dhammā*)

:   Understanding the causal relations that lead to suffering or to
    peace, especially by reflecting on the process of meditation itself.

Each of these can include a diverse range of experience. But in
meditation, it is important to keep focus. The standard formula phrases
this through the use of the reflexive idiom *kāye
kāyānupassī*. Here the locative case is used quite
literally to mean "one of the bodies in the body", or as we would say in
English, a particular aspect of the body. Thus the meditator does not
continually shift attention to whatever comes into mind but maintains a
steady, continuous awareness of a specific aspect of physical
experience.

This is a progressive practice. The nature of this progress becomes more
clear when it is recognized that mindfulness of breathing is a form of
*satipaṭṭhāna* practice.

1\.  Meditation begins with attention to the relatively coarse phenomena
    of the physical breath until it becomes calm and still.

2\.  A subtle sense of joy and bliss pervades the breath and the body.

3\.  The mind becomes free, immersed in the singular experience of the
    bliss of release.

4\.  One contemplates the changing process of meditation that has led to
    this point. The mind, empowered by immersion, lets go.

But *satipaṭṭhāna* is broader than I have indicated here,
for it includes not only the positive experiences that evolve during
meditation but also the negative ones: the pain, the constricted mind,
the hindrances. By encompassing the full range of experience,
*satipaṭṭhāna* promotes a broad, inclusive approach to
meditation, one based on awareness rather than control, laying the
groundwork for the flowering of wisdom.

This *saṁyutta* presents a series of insightful and often
delightful suttas on *satipaṭṭhāna*, but it does not define
the scope of the meditation. The definitions above are derived from the
longer discourses today found at [MN 10](https://suttacentral.net/mn10)
and [DN 22](https://suttacentral.net/dn22). However, these have
undergone considerable late development as compared with the short
discourses of the *saṁyutta*, and one cannot simply assume
that everything in [MN 10](https://suttacentral.net/mn10) and [DN
22](https://suttacentral.net/dn22) applies in the
*saṁyutta*.

The Pali compound *satipaṭṭhāna* resolves to *sati* +
*upaṭṭhāna*. This phrase is familiar from the Gradual
Training, where it refers to the moment when a practitioner sits down in
seclusion and begins meditation by "establishing mindfulness"
(*satiṁ upaṭṭhapetvā*). It thus refers
primarily to the formal practice of meditation.

Today it is common to speak of "mindfulness in daily life", but in the
suttas, this is called *sampajañña*, which I translate as
"situational awareness". This is one of the series of practices in the
Gradual Training that lays the groundwork for formal meditation. [SN
47\.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.2) makes plain the distinction
between these two by treating them as two qualities the mendicant should
develop. This is not to say, of course, that they are completely
separate, for nothing in spiritual and mental development happens in
isolation. *Sampajañña* is not limited to "mindfulness in
daily life", but plays a role in absorptions and insight as well (see
[SN 47.35](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.35)). But it is to say that
these two practices are primarily distinct, with situational awareness
helping to prepare the mind for mindfulness meditation.

The standard formula describes the mindful meditator with four terms.
These refer back to the fundamental helper practices of the Gradual
Training, reminding us that *satipaṭṭhāna* meditation does
not happen in isolation:

Keen (*ātāpī*)

:   possessing persistent and unflagging energy.

Aware (*sampajāno*)

:   possessing situational awareness.

Mindful (*satimā*)

:   possessing mindfulness.

Rid of desire and aversion for the world (*vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṁ*)

:   having eliminated the overt forms of desire and aversion through the
    practice of sense restraint. The phrase
   *abhijjhādomanassa* is elsewhere used only in the
    context of sense restraint ([DN 10](https://suttacentral.net/dn10),
    [MN 33](https://suttacentral.net/mn33), [SN
    35.120](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.120), [AN
    4.14](https://suttacentral.net/an4.14), etc.).

In the eightfold path, the awakening factors, the faculties, and the
powers, mindfulness meditation is one of the key factors leading to deep
meditative stillness and immersion. It is defined elsewhere as "the
basis for immersion in *samādhi*" ([MN
44](https://suttacentral.net/mn44): *cattāro
satipaṭṭhānā samādhinimittā*). With the
charming parable of a cook, [SN 47.8](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.8)
shows how a skillful mindfulness meditator, by understanding the
characteristics of their mind, enters immersion and abandons
defilements, while a poor meditator fails. In [SN
47\.4](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.4) the Buddha urges all meditators,
whether beginners or advanced, to practice mindfulness to the level of
full immersion (*ekodibhūtā vippasannacittā
samāhitā ekaggacittā*; "at one, with minds
that are clear, immersed in *samādhi*, and unified").

The centrality of meditative immersion is reinforced by the saying that
*satipaṭṭhāna* is the "path to convergence"
(*ekāyano maggo*). This saying is famous from [MN
10](https://suttacentral.net/mn10) but sourced from the
Saṁyutta, where the saying is placed in the mouth of
Brahmā ([SN 47.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.1), [SN
47\.18](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.18), [SN
47\.43](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.43)). It is a term from the
Upaniṣads, which in contemplative contexts means "the place
where all things come together as one" (Bṛhadāraṇyaka
Upaniṣad 2.4:11).

The meditative absorptions (*jhānas*) are explicitly
brought into *satipaṭṭhāna* in the extended and late
passage on the four noble truths in [DN
22](https://suttacentral.net/dn22). However they are implicit in many
places, including the observation of feelings under the notions of
"spiritual rapture" and "spiritual bliss", which are defined in terms of
the absorptions ([SN 36.31](https://suttacentral.net/sn36.31)); as well
as in the observation of mind under the mind that is "expansive",
"unexcelled", "immersed", "freed", all of which are terms for deep
states of absorption; or the discussion at [MN
125](https://suttacentral.net/mn125).

This is not to say that insight (or discernment,
*vipassanā*) has no place in *satipaṭṭhāna*.
On the contrary, the fourth of the *satipaṭṭhānas*, the
observation of principles, is primarily concerned with the insight that
follows from meditative immersion. Here, as described in [MN
10](https://suttacentral.net/mn10), one does not merely observe the
presence and absence of various factors, one understands the reason why
they appear and disappear. And understanding causality is the heart of
insight. This is reinforced in the teaching on mindfulness of breathing,
which introduces the contemplation of impermanence at this point.

Two suttas bring the *vipassanā* aspect to the fore. In [SN
47\.40](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.40), the Buddha first teaches the
standard *satipaṭṭhāna* practice, then introduces the
"development" of *satipaṭṭhāna*. In the suttas,
"development" means the enhancement and expansion of what is already
there. (*Bhāvanā* is derived from the causative form of the
word "to be", i.e. "to make be more".) This further development involves
contemplating all four of the *satipaṭṭhānas* in terms of
origin and cessation. The exact meaning of this is spelled out in [SN
47\.42](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.42), which gives the origin of each
of the four.

A distinctive feature of this collection is the number of charming
parables, which are as memorable as they are amusing. In addition to the
story of the cook which we mentioned above ([SN
47\.8](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.8)), we hear how a quail learned to
escape a hawk ([SN 47.6](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.6)), how a
foolish monkey got trapped in tar ([SN
47\.7](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.7)), and how two acrobats support
each other ([SN 47.19](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.19)). Another
discourse sets a seemingly impossible challenge for mindfulness
practice: to walk, carrying a bowl of oil filled to the brim, between a
popular performer and the crowd jostling to see her, while a man with a
drawn sword waits to chop off your head if you spill a drop ([SN
47\.20](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.20))!

### SN 48: Linked Discourses on the Faculties

The word *indriya* has a rather interesting history. It occurs 39 times
in the Ṛg Veda in the general sense of "the power of Indra", the great
warrior-god and dragon-slayer known in Pali as Sakka. But the nature of
this power is perhaps not what one might imagine, for more than
two-thirds of these cases connect *indriya* with *soma*.

Now, *soma* was of course a drug, probably a preparation from the
amphetamine-like stimulant ephedra. It was drunk by the ancient
Indo-Europeans to imbue warriors with berserk energy on the battlefield.
As well as taming the horse and inventing the fast two-wheeled chariot,
drug-enhanced combat was one of the key innovations underlying the
military success of the Indo-Europeans.

In the Vedic culture this was ritualized as religious practice: Indra
himself drinks *soma* to magnify his potency. He becomes unstoppable and
crushes all his enemies before him. His devotees follow his example,
manifesting the power of the god within themselves. The drug-induced
high gave them the might of the gods. But the crucial point is that the
power is not borrowed from Indra; rather, both god and devotee draw
power from the same source. It was inside them all along, it just needed
the *soma* to bring it out.

By the time of the Buddha, the Vedic age was long-gone and the *soma*
was largely forgotten. Later commentators, unfamiliar with its Vedic
roots, defined *indriya* as "rulership", and the various *indriyas* in
Buddhism as the governing faculties that exercise control over their
domains. But the use in the suttas shows that the meaning lies closer to
the Vedic sense of "potency". The *indriyas* are innate potentials that
can be manifested in the right conditions.

This is why, after the Buddha's awakening, he surveyed the world and
assessed the *indriyas* of the many different beings in it. He saw the
spiritual potential latent within each person to different degrees, and
realized that this hidden potential could be drawn out with the right
teaching and encouragement ([SN 6.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn6.1)).

To formulate a teaching on the *indriyas*, the Buddha drew upon a set of
five qualities he had developed under his former teachers
Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta
([MN 26:17](https://suttacentral.net/mn26/en/sujato#17), etc.). That
these are a set of teachings in the Brahmanical tradition is confirmed
by their mention in the Yogasūtra (1.20). He called this
set the five *indriyas*.

The same qualities were also known as the *balas* or "powers". At [SN
48\.43](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.43) the Buddha discusses the
relation between these two sets, saying they are like a river that flows
around an island. They are part of the same stream and go to the same
place, but from a certain perspective, they can be distinguished. The
term *bala*, like *indriya*, is Vedic, with the same basic sense of
potency or strength, and occurs in contexts featuring Indra and his
*soma*. The *balas* have only some repetition templates in the
*saṁyutta*, and are defined in the Aṅguttara
([AN 5.14](https://suttacentral.net/an5.14)).

The *indriyas* (together with the *balas*) came to be included in the 37
*bodhipakkhiyadhammā*, and form the heart of the Indriya
Saṁyutta, where they are defined as follows ([SN
48\.8](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.8), [SN
48\.9](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.9), [SN
48\.10](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.10)):

Faith (*saddhā*)

:   Faith in the Buddha's awakening.

Energy (*viriya*)

:   The effort to give up the bad and develop the good.

Mindfulness (*sati*)

:   Recollection of things said and done long ago, and the four kinds of
    mindfulness meditation.

Immersion (*samādhi*)

:   Unification of mind based on letting-go; further defined as the four
    absorptions (*jhānas*).

Wisdom (*paññā*)

:   Understanding impermanence and the four noble truths.

By beginning with faith (*saddhā*), the text introduces a
quality not explicitly mentioned in the earlier sets. In Buddhism, faith
is essential. In traditional Buddhist lands to this day, the quiet yet
steadfast faith and devotion to the Buddha and his teachings is
ever-present, expressed through offerings of flowers, through grace and
humility in the presence of the sacred, or uplifting recollection of the
Buddha's words. It is an emotional quality, often paired with *pema*,
"affection". But the Buddha explicitly rejected blind or "baseless
faith" ([MN 95:13](https://suttacentral.net/mn95/en/sujato#13):
*amūlikā saddhā*) and urged his followers to
develop a "grounded faith" ([MN
47:16](https://suttacentral.net/mn47/en/sujato#16):
*ākāravatī saddhā*) based on careful and
critical inquiry.

This is a faith that is akin to the confidence and trust that a
scientist needs when relying on the findings and theories of others in
their field. It is essential in order to get anywhere; but at the same
time, it is completely provisional. If there is anything that is
contradicted by the evidence, it should be rejected. And once you have
seen the truth for yourself, there is no need for faith, as pointed out
by Venerable Sāriputta in [SN
48\.44](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.44).

Following the pattern we have seen in previous sets of qualities, the
mention of faith aligns the faculties with the progress of one following
the Gradual Training. First, one hears the teaching and gains faith,
then one goes forth and applies energy in practice, undertaking
mindfulness meditation, realizing the absorptions and the wisdom into
impermanence that follows on from them. At this point, a practitioner
goes beyond simple belief or reasoned argument and sees the truth for
themselves. Their faith is described as *aveccappasāda*,
"experiential" or "confirmed" confidence. The word *avecca* literally
means "having undergone". It is only at this point that faith is
unshakable.

Many suttas on the five faculties are built along the same kinds of
patterns and templates as the *saṁyuttas* on the noble
eightfold path or the awakening factors. But in two related respects
they are quite distinctive. And both of these distinctive features stem
from the root sense of *indriya* as "potency" or "potential".

The first of these two features is the use of the faculties to grade
practitioners. One who truly understands the faculties is a
stream-enterer ([SN 48.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.2), [SN
48\.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.3)), while one who, based on this
understanding, completely lets go is a perfected one ([SN
48\.4](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.4), [SN
48\.5](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.5)). This grading of practitioners
based on their development of the faculties is extended in more detail
in a further series of discourses ([SN
48\.12--18](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.12), [SN
48\.24](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.24)).

So while, in one sense, we all have these faculties within us as a
hidden potential, they do not manifest their strength until empowered by
the path. Once that happens, at the moment of stream-entry, they are as
unstoppable as Indra on a dragon-slaying rampage.

To understand the second distinctive feature, recall that in these
*saṁyuttas* we are dealing with the path, the fourth of the
noble truths, which is "to be developed" (*bhāvetabba*).
And while the Indriya Saṁyutta, like other
*saṁyuttas* on the path, does indeed speak of the
"development of the faculties", a series of suttas also speaks of
understanding the faculties in light of the four noble truths ([SN
48\.2--7](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.2)). Normally such phrasing is
found in discourses dealing with the first noble truth, such as those on
the aggregates or sense fields, which are "to be fully understood". Here
the texts are blurring the distinction between the first and fourth
noble truths. To be sure, this is not unique; we have already noted that
a couple of discourses on *satipaṭṭhāna* do a similar thing
differently. But it is unusual, and certainly the emphasis is unique.

There is nothing doctrinally difficult about this; after all, the path
is conditioned ([AN 4.34](https://suttacentral.net/an4.34)), and all
conditioned things are suffering. But the Buddha usually spoke of the
path in glowingly positive terms, not about its suffering and drawbacks.

Once again, this makes sense when we consider the faculties as inner
potentials, as something that we already possess in a latent form to one
degree or another. In understanding the faculties we are understanding
*who we are* and *who we might become*.

This idea that an *indriya* is a potency or ability or strength
possessed by a person is further developed in the remainder of the
*saṁyutta*, which introduces a series of faculties beyond
the basic five. Together with the five faculties, these make up a list
of 22 faculties, which became a standard set in the Abhidhamma (see [Vb
5](https://suttacentral.net/vb5)). Here they are in the Abhidhamma
sequence:

- The six sense faculties ([SN
  48.25](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.25)).

- Three biological faculties: femininity, masculinity, and vitality ([SN
  48.22](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.22)).

- Five kinds of feeling as faculties ([SN
  48.31](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.31)).

- The five spiritual faculties.

- Three faculties relating to stages of awakening ([SN
  48.23](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.23)).

Senses, feelings, and even biological attributes, are things that
everyone possesses. They must be understood as part of conditioned
reality, and hence suffering, but they can be harnessed to empower the
spiritual path.

### SN 51: Linked Discourses on the Bases for Psychic Power

We have learned that the terms *indriya* and *bala*, which we translate
as "faculty" and "power" were Vedic terms closely associated with the
divine might of the war-god Indra. The current *saṁyutta*
deals with *iddhi*, another Vedic term with a similar meaning of
"success, power, potency". Note that the Pali *iddhi* is identical in
meaning with two Vedic terms, *siddhi* and *ṛddhi*, but
formally it is derived from the latter. *Pāda* literally
means "foot", and since *iddhipāda* is defined as the "path
or practice to gaining *iddhi*" ([SN
51\.27](https://suttacentral.net/sn51.27)), it's tempting to maintain the
metaphor by speaking of the "four footsteps to psychic power".

*Iddhis* may refer to various kinds of success, potency, or power, but
in this context, they consist of various astonishing feats of psychic
power or superpowers. Such feats have a long and colorful history in
India. In the Vedas, as we have seen, they originated in the legendary
military prowess of the gods, to which mortals aspired with the aid of
stimulants. As the *soma* vanished, it seems, other means of
transcending normal human and physical limits were sought. Ascetics
undertook punishing mortifications (*tapas*), torturing their bodies in
search of superpowers. While some pre-Buddhist religious
practitioners---notably those of the Jains and the
Upaniṣads---had set themselves more lofty and worthy goals
than mere powers, there remained many for whom spiritual practice was a
means to these decidedly worldly ends.

The modern cultural fascination with superheroes shows that this is not
bound to a specific cultural time or place. It is about the very human
longing for transcendence and transformation, becoming other, becoming
more. Superheroes display many of the same kinds of powers talked about
in the Buddhist and other ancient Indian texts: mind-reading, enhanced
senses, the ability to control the elements or to multiply one's form,
to fly in the sky and even through space ([SN
51\.11](https://suttacentral.net/sn51.11)). And the means by which powers
are gained remain similar to the pre-Buddhist traditions: they may be of
divine or alien origin; or derived from a drug or chemical agent; or the
outcome of enduring trials and suffering.

Dispensing with these methods, however, the Buddha said that superpowers
are gained through pure mental development or meditation. The focus
shifted from the powers themselves to the means for attaining them;
which, it turns out, also happens to be the path to awakening. The
various powers extend or enhance ordinary human abilities, and they may
be developed in the same way as any other ability is developed: by
practice.

Despite their frequent mention in Buddhist texts, psychic powers are
notably omitted when it comes to the really important things. They are
side-effects of the spiritual path, things that may be fun and of some
worth as preliminary exercises, but far from the true goal (see [SN
12\.70](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.70)). The Buddha had a decidedly
ambiguous attitude to powers, especially when they were shown off. He
forbade the monastics from displaying them publicly, saying monks who
make such displays were like a woman who shows her private parts for a
cheap coin ([Kd 15:8.2](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15#8.2)).
Displays of psychic powers are moreover criticized because they seem
like mere magic ([DN 11:5](https://suttacentral.net/dn11/en/sujato#5),
[AN 3.60](https://suttacentral.net/an3.60)). And the possession of
superpowers was by no means a sign of genuine spiritual attainment, for
even Devadatta, the Buddha's arch-nemesis, was said to have attained
them ([Kd 17:1.4](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd17#1.4)).

None of this addresses the question of whether such powers are real. The
suttas assume throughout that they are, and there is no reason to think
this does not reflect the Buddha's views. Traditional Buddhism has
always accepted the reality of experiences and powers beyond the normal,
and Buddhist cultures are full of anecdotes and stories about such
events. Rigorous studies, however, are harder to come by. The
extraordinary *Irreducible Mind*, a sustained critique of reductionist
theories of mind, assembles hundreds of studies into various kinds of
extraordinary phenomena. While a reasonable person may well remain
skeptical, it seems there is a significant body of evidence in support
of such things as mind-reading or recollection of past lives. The
ability to fly or to touch the sun remain, sadly, unattested.

Normally in the suttas the term *iddhi* is used for a specific set of
psychic powers, which primarily exhibit mastery over the physical realm
([SN 51.19](https://suttacentral.net/sn51.19), etc.). These are
typically included within a broader set of six "direct knowledges"
(*abhiññā*), which are also mentioned in this
*saṁyutta* ([SN 51.11](https://suttacentral.net/sn51.11)).
The final one of these is the ending of defilements and rebirth, the
true goal of Buddhist practice.

As to the substance of the *iddhipādas*, there are four
basic terms:

Enthusiasm (*chanda*)

:   This is one of the most common words for "desire". While not
    formally mentioned as an item in the other lists of the
   *bodhipakkhiyadhammā*, it appears in the formula for
    the four right efforts. It is the desire to do good, to practice, to
    escape suffering.

Energy (*viriya*)

:   This is the single most common factor among the 37
   *bodhipakkhiyadhammā*. However, in the bases for
    psychic power it receives special emphasis as it is not only one of
    the factors, but also qualifies each of the factors.

Mind (*citta*)

:   Thought, idea, resolve, or awareness (see below).

Inquiry (*vīmaṁsā*)

:   Inquiry or investigation into the Dhamma, but especially into what
    obstructs meditation and what helps it. In this context, it is not
    too far in meaning from "curiosity".

Curiously enough, though the word *citta* has a wide range of meanings,
it is not clearly defined in this context. Even the Abhidhamma and
commentaries offer little more than the usual list of synonyms for
"mind" ([Vb 9](https://suttacentral.net/vb9)). Normally in the context
of the path, the mind is "to be developed" (see [SN
51\.9](https://suttacentral.net/sn51.9)) and such "development of mind"
(*cittabhāvanā*) is a term for *samādhi* and
the path to it. Accordingly, *citta* falls between the energy and wisdom
factors, in the place normally occupied by *samādhi* and
mindfulness, and is said to be developed in the normal way of
*samādhi* (see [SN
51\.11](https://suttacentral.net/sn51.11)). And *samādhi*
itself, like energy, is constantly emphasized as essential to this
practice at every point.

However, *citta* is also the thought or intention that gets you to your
destination ([SN 51.15](https://suttacentral.net/sn51.15)). In line with
this, one gains *samādhi* by relying on *citta* ([SN
51\.13](https://suttacentral.net/sn51.13)), which suggests that *citta*
cannot be exactly identical with *samādhi*.

Perhaps the term *citta* was used here precisely because of its breadth
of meaning. It encompasses the "thought" of the Dhamma, of practice, or
of the goal; the "idea" one has in mind that leads one on; the "resolve"
that keeps attention focused; the growing "awareness" as the goal comes
into view; and the purified "consciousness" of deep meditation. In this
way *citta* here covers the same ground as it does as one of the four
*satipaṭṭhānas*: it refers to the mental state with which
one develops the path, including, but not limited to, states of
*samādhi*.

The four bases are almost always presented in a stock formula that
consists of a long compound, the meaning of which is explained at [SN
51\.13](https://suttacentral.net/sn51.13). Each of the four qualities may
be relied on to develop deep unification of mind, or
*samādhi*. This process involves making an active effort,
defined in terms of the four right efforts. Thus each of the
*iddhipādas* consists of these three aspects:

1\.  One of the four qualities.

2\.  The meditative immersion that results.

3\.  The effort required.

At [SN 51.20](https://suttacentral.net/sn51.20) we find the most
detailed explanation of how these are applied in practice. This sutta
brings in several practices familiar from elsewhere in the suttas, such
as the contemplation of the 31 parts of the body. While most of these
are straightforward, there is a somewhat obscure Pali idiom that begs a
little clarification. That is the phrase "as before, so after; as after,
so before" (*yathā pure tathā
pacchā, yathā pacchā
tathā pure*), called the "perception of continuity"
(*pacchāpuresaññā*). Similar phrases are found in several
places in the context of meditation ([Thag
6\.4](https://suttacentral.net/thag6.4), [SN
47\.10](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.10), [AN
7\.61](https://suttacentral.net/an7.61), [AN
3\.90](https://suttacentral.net/an3.90)). In the Vinaya, the same phrase
is used to emphasize that the status of a mendicant remains unchanged.
In meditation, it points to the need for constant and consistent effort
in maintaining one's focus. As part of a series of related idioms---as
above, so below; as by day, so by night; as this is, so is that---it
indicates how the process of meditation moves from diversity and
differentiation towards unity and oneness.

When first encountering the bases for psychic power, students are often
puzzled by an apparent paradox. Desire, so we're told, is the cause of
suffering, yet here we are supposed to develop it. This problem is
addressed directly in [SN 51.15](https://suttacentral.net/sn51.15),
where Ānanda explains to the brahmin Uṇṇābha that the
spiritual path is lived to give up desire, which is accomplished by
developing the four bases of psychic power. But Uṇṇābha
protests, for desire is itself one of the four bases, and desire cannot
be given up using desire. Ānanda resolves the contradiction with the
simile of a man walking to a park. Before setting out, one has the
desire, the energy, the idea, or the curiosity to reach the park. But
when you get there, those things vanish. In the same way, the desire or
enthusiasm to reach the goal of spiritual practice carries you to the
goal, but once there it is no longer needed.
