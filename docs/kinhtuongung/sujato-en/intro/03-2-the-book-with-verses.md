# The Book With Verses

The "Book With Verses" (Sagāthāvagga) is divided into
eleven *saṁyuttas*, with a total of 271 suttas.

While most of the Saṁyutta is organized around subject
matter, here the organizational principle is *people*. Each
*saṁyutta* depicts a conversation involving the Buddha or
his disciples with a different person or kind of person, such as gods,
kings, nuns, or brahmins.

A typical sutta has a bare narrative framework, where someone comes to
the Buddha and utters a verse, and the Buddha replies with a better one.
In some cases, notably the Sakka Saṁyutta, the narrative
element is developed into a lively exchange.

### Verse & Prose

Each of the suttas in this collection contains verse with a prose
narrative background, although in many cases the prose has been omitted
through abbreviation. This kind of literary form is common in Indic
literature, so it is worth spending a little time to understand it.

The oldest Indic literature is the Ṛg Veda, a collection of about 10,600
verses. These were passed down in the oral tradition of the brahmins for
thousands of years. One of the keys to the accurate transmission of this
sacred lore was the use of meter: rhythmic patterns of long and short
syllables. Such meters provide a scaffolding that organizes words, and
hence knowledge, in a form that is as memorable as a song; indeed, they
would have been sung in a simple melody. In this way, the verses become
set in a precise and defined form, one that may be preserved and passed
down unaltered through the generations.

But poetry is not just technically complex; it is ecstatic, inspired,
divine. The brahmins did not see the Vedas as being authored in the
normal sense, but channeled as the divine word of god
(Brahmā) through human sages (Pali: *isi*; Sanskrit:
*ṛṣi*). The Vedic verses constantly allude to stories,
myths, and events---for example, the slaying of the dragon
Vṛtra by the god-hero Indra---that were well known to their
audience, and thus did not require spelling out in the text itself. The
verses are hymns, invoked in ritual to heighten the emotional response,
to inspire awe, fear, or devotion. They are given meaning and context by
the background understanding of the mythology. Thus the verses imply a
story, of which they are the emotional and narrative climax.

So we can think of a verse as the seed crystal around which a more
flexible prose narrative grows and evolves. The prose may be adjusted to
time and place, presented in greater or lesser detail, or adapted for
the audience. It may comment on contemporary events or express a
personal perspective, but the verse is (in theory) always the same.

We are speaking here of the verses found in the
Sagāthāvagga. But it is worth bearing in mind that there
are plenty of verses in the *nikāyas* outside the
Sagāthāvagga, and they are not all of the same type. Here
is a summary of the main verse types you will encounter. This is just to
help a reader get a rough orientation, and exceptions and blurred lines
are easily found.

Climactic verse

:   As in the Sagāthāvagga, such verses appear at the
    climax of a narrative. The narrative may be very thin, or even
    absent, yet it is always assumed. Sometimes it is supplied in later
    commentaries. This form is used outside the
    Sagāthāvagga in such texts as the Dhammapada,
    Udāna, and Jātakas. We might also consider
    under this head longer devotional verses such as those of Sela ([MN
    92](https://suttacentral.net/mn92), [Snp
    3.7](https://suttacentral.net/snp3.7)).

Independent poems

:   A set of verses that makes up a unified literary and thematic whole,
    and is independent of a prose narrative. There are relatively few of
    these in the four *nikāyas*, but they dominate the
    Sutta Nipāta. The last *vagga* of that book contains a
    series of such independent poems, all united within a narrative set
    in verse. Some of the verses of the Sagāthāvagga might
    be considered under this head, if the prose narrative is dismissed
    as negligible.

Devotional invocations

:   Such texts as the Mahāsamaya Sutta ([DN
    20](https://suttacentral.net/dn20)), the Āṭāṇātiya
    Sutta ([DN 32](https://suttacentral.net/dn32)), or the Isigili Sutta
    ([MN 116](https://suttacentral.net/mn116)) occupy an unusual place
    in the early Buddhist corpus. Thin in their doctrinal content, they
    appear more as incantations for protection or blessings.

Summary verse

:   Like the climactic verses, these accompany prose. But rather than
    being an emotional highlight, they serve as a mnemonic device to
    help preserve the content of the prose. These are most familiar in
    the *uddānas* that appear at the end of *vaggas* and
    other sections throughout the EBTs, typically listing a keyword from
    each text and thus acting as a kind of table of contents. These are
    not to be confused with the genre of climactic verse known as
   *udāna*, "inspired saying", which, despite the similar
    spelling, is a completely different word. In addition to the formal
   *uddānas*, we can consider under this head many of the
    verses of the Aṅguttara, especially in the Fours, which
    often serve purely to summarize the content of the prose, although
    occasionally they are developed into a more satisfying poetic
    reflection on the theme. Occasionally a longer sutta will contain
    mixed portions of prose and summary verse, notably the
    Dvayatānupassanā Sutta ([Snp
    3.12](https://suttacentral.net/snp3.12)). A much later development
    of this style is found in the Lakkhaṇa Sutta ([DN
    30](https://suttacentral.net/dn30)).

In my translations, I have rendered verse as prose broken into lines,
rarely attempting poetic virtue. To render these highly didactic verses,
dense with doctrinal terms, into genuine English verse is no easy task.
In many cases, especially with the summary verses, the text in Pali has
little in the way of literary merit. Other texts, especially the later
verses, display a learned command of complex and sophisticated literary
forms such as is rare to find, even among writers of English poetry.
Combined with the often obscure vocabulary, rare and archaic grammatical
forms, and syntactic flexibility of Pali verses, the task of rendering
them in readable and accurate English is hard and time-consuming, even
without aspiring to poetic beauty. So my verse is workmanlike, and I can
only hope that poets take up the task of rendering selected verses with
the beauty they deserve.

### The Play of the Gods

In the Book With Verses we see the ancient Vedic pattern adopted to
serve a Buddhist purpose. It is no coincidence that here we meet various
deities, many of whom hail from Vedic mythology, in contexts that
sometimes directly respond to specific Vedic or Brahmanical passages.

The casual appearance of deities throughout these texts is, of course,
problematic. These days, we don't normally see gods manifesting with
glorious light at spiritual gatherings. So how are we to understand
this?

One obvious answer is that such texts are literally true: gods of these
names did appear in exactly the way depicted and have these exact
conversations. If so, why are such things not seen in our day? One might
be tempted to point regretfully to the decline of religious and ethical
life in modern times. But this is just another unverifiable claim: how
could we possibly know such a thing? And it creates an even bigger
problem. For when we see the past as a uniquely privileged era, one
blessed with a degree of purity and wholesomeness that is lost to us,
then what is the point of practice? Are we not better off pining for the
glories of old, and wishing for the renewal of the Dhamma under the
future Buddha Metteyya? Such views forget a basic principle of the
teaching: it is *akāliko*---we can realize it here & now,
no matter when we live.

So perhaps we are better off adopting a skeptical view: such deities do
not exist, and such events did not happen. They are simply religious
propaganda, fictions whose purpose is to convert simple people by
importing a familiar Indic cosmology. If there is any reality at all to
them, it is purely psychological; such beings represent different
aspects of the mind. Despite its scientific appearance, this reductive
view, too, is unsustainable. The ideas of rebirth and the existence of
multiple dimensions of existence are not found just in popular
narratives, but are central to core teachings such as dependent
origination and the four noble truths---the second noble truth is
precisely "the craving that leads to future rebirth"
(*yāyaṁ taṇhā ponobbhavikā*).
They can't be simply written off as an uncritical inheritance from
Indian culture.

These views are polar opposites; and like all pairs of opposites, they
share more in common than they like to admit. Both of them are concerned
with *facts*, with whether these events were true or not. But the texts
as we have them are not collections of facts: they are stories. And the
significance of a story lies in its meaning. Whether a story is real or
not is at best secondary, and often beside the point entirely. It serves
to engage an audience, provoking wonder, surprise, awe, or joy.

The Buddhist traditions understood this well, as evidenced by the
textual situation. While in some cases the verses and story are tightly
linked, it is very common for the same verse to be accompanied by
completely different background narratives, or by no background at all.
The verses, which convey the essential Dhamma teaching, the core of
meaning and emotion, remain the same, while the story varies. To insist
on the factuality or otherwise of the story is to miss the point. The
story provides a context that brings the teaching in the verses to life
for an audience.

Thus the best lens through which to see such texts is neither as history
nor as propaganda but as sacred story; that is, as myth. Each of the
short suttas tells a story that conveys a timeless spiritual truth in a
way that spoke to the audience of that time and place. They take place
within a wider mythology that helps people find their place in a vast
and unknown cosmos.

As always, the early Buddhist response to the earlier religious
traditions is complex and nuanced. And, while it is true that many of
the details of both literary form and subject matter are drawn from the
Vedas, it is in the differences that the distinctively Buddhist
character of the texts shows itself.

In the Vedas, the human agents are merely the transmitters of the sacred
word of the gods. Exactly how this happened is unclear, but it probably
involved a combination of drugs (*soma* is one of the great Vedic
deities), ritual, creative inspiration, traditional lore, devotion, and
communal empowerment, all of which inspired the sacred poets to heights
of ecstatic visioning through which the words of the gods manifested.
But regardless of the details, the key point is that the traditions
regarded the human agent in the relationship as incidental, and the real
value of the texts as stemming from the divine.

In the Buddhist texts, the situation is reversed. The gods do not
inspire human hosts, they speak for themselves. And they are no
infallible reserves of Truth; they may be right or wrong, skillful or
foolish, just like anyone else. While the magnificence of their presence
is emphasized, the ultimate effect is to show the worthlessness of such
displays, for the gods are constantly being schooled by the Buddha. The
most characteristic form of dialogue is where a god presents an idea
that is pretty good, within a limited, mundane (i.e. Vedic) worldview,
but which the Buddha elevates to an entirely new level.

It is an elementary axiom of Buddhism that the gods are not
metaphysical, in the sense that they do not exist in a separate realm
governed by different principles than our own. On the contrary, they are
impermanent and suffering, trapped in the cycle of transmigration just
like us. It follows from this that they do not have access to any
special form of knowledge or wisdom. Buddhists do not look to the gods
for teachings; rather, the Buddha is "teacher of gods and humans".

I have focused on the interactions with divine beings in this
collection, as these require the most contextualizing. But not all of
the collections feature divine beings. Many of the
*saṁyuttas* feature kinds of people familiar from other
texts of the time. And even when divine beings are involved, in the
majority of cases, the verses themselves do not require a divine
setting, as there's nothing about the gods and their divine dramas in
the verses themselves.

Some of the texts in this collection are well-known and widely quoted,
such as the invitation of Brahmā or the nun
Vajirā's simile of the person as a chariot. Most of the
suttas here have parallels in the Chinese Saṁyuktāgama
translations; the partial translations SA-2 and SA-3 include
Sagāthāvagga material. In addition, many of the verses have
parallels elsewhere throughout the Buddhist literature in all languages.
