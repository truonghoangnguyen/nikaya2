# The Linked Discourses: the blueprint for Buddhist philosophy

The Saṁyutta Nikāya is the third of the four
main divisions in the Sutta Piṭaka of the Pali Canon
(*tipiṭaka*). It is translated here as *Linked Discourses*,
and has been previously translated as the *Connected Discourses* or the
*Kindred Sayings*. As the title suggests, its discourses are grouped
thematically. These thematic groups of texts are called
*saṁyuttas*, and the Saṁyutta
Nikāya is the collection of such *saṁyuttas*.

The Saṁyutta Nikāya consists of 56
*saṁyuttas* collected in five large "books" (*vagga*),
containing over a thousand discourses. The Mahāsaṅgīti text
as used on SuttaCentral contains 2837 discourses; but the total number
is somewhat arbitrary, as it depends on how the abbreviated texts are
expanded, which differs in different editions. This variation, however,
applies only to the way the texts are counted and does not affect the
content, which is virtually identical in every edition.

It is in the Saṁyutta Nikāya that we find the
core doctrines that have formed the basis for all subsequent Buddhist
philosophy. It is largely structured around major doctrinal sections
that correspond with the template of the four noble truths.

Suffering

:   Aggregates ([SN 22](https://suttacentral.net/sn22)); six sense
    fields ([SN 35](https://suttacentral.net/sn35)).

The origin of suffering

:   Dependent origination ([SN 12](https://suttacentral.net/sn12))

The cessation of suffering

:   Dependent cessation ([SN 12](https://suttacentral.net/sn12)); the
    unconditioned ([SN 43](https://suttacentral.net/sn43)).

The practice that leads to the end of suffering

:   The chapters of the final book, the Mahāvagga ([SN
    45--54](https://suttacentral.net/sn-mahavaggasamyutta)).

The four noble truths themselves are treated in the final chapter, the
Sacca Saṁyutta ([SN 56](https://suttacentral.net/sn56)).

Not all the *saṁyuttas* fit so easily into this scheme.
There are many minor *saṁyuttas*, which are sometimes
connected with a major *saṁyutta*, and sometimes not. In
addition, the first book, the Sagāthāvagga, is not
organized by subject. Rather, the thematic linking here is the type of
person involved in the discourse. These texts are also unified in
literary form; they are in mixed prose and verse.

This collection has a full parallel in the Saṁyuktāgama
(SA) of the Sarvāstivāda school in Chinese translation. In
addition, there are two partial collections in Chinese (SA-2 and SA-3)
as well as several miscellaneous or fragmentary texts in Chinese,
Sanskrit, and Tibetan. Much of the organizational structure of SN is
shared with SA, suggesting that this structure preceded the split
between these two collections.
