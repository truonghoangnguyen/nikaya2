# A Brief Textual History

The Saṁyutta Nikāya was edited by M. Léon Feer
on the basis of manuscripts in Sinhalese and Burmese scripts and
published in Latin script by the Pali Text Society from 1884 to 1898.
The first translation followed in 1917--30 by Mrs. C.A.F. Rhys Davids
(vols. 1--2) and F.L. Woodward (vols. 3--5) under the title *The Book of
the Kindred Sayings*. In 1999 the PTS issued a new edition of the Pali
text of vol. 1 Sagāthāvagga, edited by G.A. Somaratne.

While several partial translations were subsequently made, there was no
complete new translation in English until 2002, when Bhikkhu Bodhi
published his *The Connected Discourses of the Buddha*. As with his
translation of the *The Middle-Length Discourses of the Buddha*, this
constituted a major leap forward, essentially rendering the earlier
translations obsolete. Unlike the *Middle-Length Discourses*, this was
an entirely new translation. In an extensive introduction, Bhikkhu Bodhi
spelled out his evolving approach to translation and presented a
detailed thematic and structural analysis of the text.

Where the Pali was unclear I frequently referred to the earlier work of
Bodhi, and rarely to Woodward/Rhys Davids and various translations of
specific texts.
