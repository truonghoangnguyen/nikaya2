## The Chapter on Ambapālī the Courtesan

### SN 47.1 In Ambapālī's Mango Grove *Ambapālisutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Vesālī, in Ambapālī's Mango Grove. There the
Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to
convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past
sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the
system, and to realize extinguishment. What four?

It's when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the
body---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for
the world.

They meditate observing an aspect of feelings---keen, aware, and
mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.

They meditate observing an aspect of the mind---keen, aware, and
mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.

They meditate observing an aspect of principles---keen, aware, and
mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.

The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence.
They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and
crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and
to realize extinguishment."

That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants approved what
the Buddha said.

### SN 47.2 Mindful *Satisutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, in
Ambapālī's mango grove. There the Buddha addressed the
mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, a mendicant should live mindful and aware. This is my
instruction to you.

And how is a mendicant mindful? It's when a mendicant meditates by
observing an aspect of the body---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of
covetousness and displeasure for the world. They meditate observing an
aspect of feelings ... mind ... principles---keen, aware, and mindful,
rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. That's how a
mendicant is mindful.

And how is a mendicant aware? It's when a mendicant acts with
situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead
and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer
robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when
urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping,
waking, speaking, and keeping silent. That's how a mendicant acts with
situational awareness. A mendicant should live mindful and aware. This
is my instruction to you."

### SN 47.3 A Monk *Bhikkhusutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and
said to him, "Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When
I've heard it, I'll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and
resolute."

"This is exactly how some silly people ask me for something. But when
the teaching has been explained they think only of following me around."

"Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief! May the Holy One
teach me the Dhamma in brief! Hopefully I can understand the meaning of
what the Buddha says! Hopefully I can be an heir of the Buddha's
teaching!"

"Well then, mendicant, you should purify the starting point of skillful
qualities. What is the starting point of skillful qualities? Well
purified ethics and correct view. When your ethics are well purified and
your view is correct, you should develop the four kinds of mindfulness
meditation in three ways, depending on and grounded on ethics.

What four?

Meditate observing an aspect of the body internally---keen, aware, and
mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. Or meditate
observing an aspect of the body externally---keen, aware, and mindful,
rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. Or meditate observing
an aspect of the body internally and externally---keen, aware, and
mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.

Or meditate observing an aspect of feelings internally ... externally
... internally and externally---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of
covetousness and displeasure for the world.

Or meditate observing an aspect of the mind internally ... externally
... internally and externally---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of
covetousness and displeasure for the world.

Or meditate observing an aspect of principles internally ... externally
... internally and externally---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of
covetousness and displeasure for the world. When you develop the four
kinds of mindfulness meditation in these three ways, depending on and
grounded on ethics, you can expect growth, not decline, in skillful
qualities, whether by day or by night."

And then that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said.
He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha,
keeping him on his right, before leaving.

Then that mendicant, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and
resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this
very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for
which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.

He understood: "Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been
completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further
for this place." And that mendicant became one of the perfected.

### SN 47.4 At Sālā *Sālasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans near the
brahmin village of Sālā. There the Buddha addressed the
mendicants:

"Mendicants, those mendicants who are junior---recently gone forth,
newly come to this teaching and training---should be encouraged,
supported, and established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.
What four? Please, reverends, meditate observing an aspect of the
body---keen, aware, at one, with minds that are clear, immersed in
samādhi, and unified, so as to truly know the body.
Meditate observing an aspect of feelings---keen, aware, at one, with
minds that are clear, immersed in samādhi, and unified, so
as to truly know feelings. Meditate observing an aspect of the
mind---keen, aware, at one, with minds that are clear, immersed in
samādhi, and unified, so as to truly know the mind.
Meditate observing an aspect of principles---keen, aware, at one, with
minds that are clear, immersed in samādhi, and unified, so
as to truly know principles.

Those mendicants who are trainees---who haven't achieved their heart's
desire, but live aspiring to the supreme sanctuary from the yoke---also
meditate observing an aspect of the body---keen, aware, at one, with
minds that are clear, immersed in samādhi, and unified, so
as to fully understand the body. They meditate observing an aspect of
feelings---keen, aware, at one, with minds that are clear, immersed in
samādhi, and unified, so as to fully understand feelings.
They meditate observing an aspect of the mind---keen, aware, at one,
with minds that are clear, immersed in samādhi, and
unified, so as to fully understand the mind. They meditate observing an
aspect of principles---keen, aware, at one, with minds that are clear,
immersed in samādhi, and unified, so as to fully understand
principles.

Those mendicants who are perfected---who have ended the defilements,
completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the
burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued
existence, and are rightly freed through enlightenment---also meditate
observing an aspect of the body---keen, aware, at one, with minds that
are clear, immersed in samādhi, and unified, detached from
the body. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings---keen, aware,
at one, with minds that are clear, immersed in samādhi, and
unified, detached from feelings. They meditate observing an aspect of
the mind---keen, aware, at one, with minds that are clear, immersed in
samādhi, and unified, detached from the mind. They meditate
observing an aspect of principles---keen, aware, at one, with minds that
are clear, immersed in samādhi, and unified, detached from
principles.

Those mendicants who are junior---recently gone forth, newly come to
this teaching and training---should be encouraged, supported, and
established in these four kinds of mindfulness meditation."

### SN 47.5 A Heap of the Unskillful *Akusalarāsisutta*

At Sāvatthī.

There the Buddha said:

"Rightly speaking, mendicants, you'd call these five hindrances a 'heap
of the unskillful'. For these five hindrances are entirely a heap of the
unskillful. What five? The hindrances of sensual desire, ill will,
dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. Rightly
speaking, you'd call these five hindrances a 'heap of the unskillful'.
For these five hindrances are entirely a heap of the unskillful.

Rightly speaking, you'd call these four kinds of mindfulness meditation
a 'heap of the skillful'. For these four kinds of mindfulness meditation
are entirely a heap of the skillful. What four? It's when a mendicant
meditates by observing an aspect of the body---keen, aware, and mindful,
rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. They meditate
observing an aspect of feelings ... They meditate observing an aspect of
the mind ... They meditate observing an aspect of principles---keen,
aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.
Rightly speaking, you'd call these four kinds of mindfulness meditation
a 'heap of the skillful'. For these four kinds of mindfulness meditation
are entirely a heap of the skillful."

### SN 47.6 A Hawk *Sakuṇagghisutta*

"Once upon a time, mendicants, a hawk suddenly swooped down and grabbed
a quail. And as the quail was being carried off he wailed, 'I'm so
unlucky, so unfortunate, to have roamed out of my territory into the
domain of others. If today I'd roamed within my own territory, the
domain of my fathers, this hawk wouldn't have been able to beat me by
fighting.'

'So, quail, what is your own territory, the domain of your fathers?'

'It's a ploughed field covered with clods of earth.'

Confident in her own strength, the hawk was not daunted or intimidated.
She released the quail, saying, 'Go now, quail. But even there you won't
escape me!'

Then the quail went to a ploughed field covered with clods of earth. He
climbed up a big clod, and standing there, he said to the hawk: 'Come
get me, hawk! Come get me, hawk!'

Confident in her own strength, the hawk was not daunted or intimidated.
She folded her wings and suddenly swooped down on the quail. When the
quail knew that the hawk was nearly there, he slipped under that clod.
But the hawk crashed chest-first right there.

That's what happens when you roam out of your territory into the domain
of others.

So, mendicants, don't roam out of your own territory into the domain of
others. If you roam out of your own territory into the domain of others,
Māra will find a vulnerability and get hold of you.

And what is not a mendicant's own territory but the domain of others?
It's the five kinds of sensual stimulation. What five? Sights known by
the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and
arousing. Sounds known by the ear ... Smells known by the nose ...
Tastes known by the tongue ... Touches known by the body, which are
likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. This is
not a mendicant's own territory but the domain of others.

You should roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers.
If you roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers,
Māra won't find a vulnerability or get hold of you.

And what is a mendicant's own territory, the domain of the fathers? It's
the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. What four? It's when a
mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body---keen, aware,
and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. They
meditate observing an aspect of feelings ... mind ... principles---keen,
aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.
This is a mendicant's own territory, the domain of the fathers."

<!--pg-->
### SN 47.7 A Monkey *Makkaṭasutta*

"Mendicants, in the Himalayas there are regions that are rugged and
impassable. In some such regions, neither monkeys nor humans can go,
while in others, monkeys can go but not humans. There are also level,
pleasant places where both monkeys and humans can go. There hunters lay
snares of tar on the monkey trails to catch the monkeys.

The monkeys who are not foolhardy and reckless see the tar and avoid it
from afar. But a foolish and reckless monkey goes up to the tar and
grabs it with a hand. He gets stuck there. Thinking to free his hand, he
grabs it with his other hand. He gets stuck there. Thinking to free both
hands, he grabs it with a foot. He gets stuck there. Thinking to free
both hands and foot, he grabs it with his other foot. He gets stuck
there. Thinking to free both hands and feet, he grabs it with his snout.
He gets stuck there.

And so the monkey, trapped at five points, just lies there screeching.
He'd meet with tragedy and disaster, and the hunter can do what he wants
with him. The hunter spears him, pries him off that tarred block of
wood, and goes wherever he wants.

That's what happens when you roam out of your territory into the domain
of others.

So, mendicants, don't roam out of your own territory into the domain of
others. If you roam out of your own territory into the domain of others,
Māra will find a vulnerability and get hold of you.

And what is not a mendicant's own territory but the domain of others?
It's the five kinds of sensual stimulation. What five? Sights known by
the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and
arousing. Sounds known by the ear ... Smells known by the nose ...
Tastes known by the tongue ... Touches known by the body, which are
likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. This is
not a mendicant's own territory but the domain of others.

You should roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers.
If you roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers,
Māra won't find a vulnerability or get hold of you.

And what is a mendicant's own territory, the domain of the fathers? It's
the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. What four? It's when a
mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body---keen, aware,
and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. They
meditate observing an aspect of feelings ... mind ... principles---keen,
aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.
This is a mendicant's own territory, the domain of the fathers."

### SN 47.8 Cooks *Sūdasutta*

"Mendicants, suppose a foolish, incompetent, unskillful cook was to
serve a ruler or their chief minister with an extravagant variety of
curries: superbly sour, bitter, pungent, and sweet; hot and mild, and
salty and bland.

But that cook didn't take their master's hint: 'Today my master
preferred this sauce, or he reached for it, or he took a lot of it, or
he praised it. Today my master preferred the sour or bitter or pungent
or sweet or hot or mild or salty sauce. Or he preferred the bland sauce,
or he reached for the bland one, or he took a lot of it, or he praised
it.'

That foolish, incompetent, unskillful cook doesn't get presented with
clothes, wages, or bonuses. Why is that? Because they don't take their
master's hint.

In the same way, a foolish, incompetent, unskillful mendicant meditates
by observing an aspect of the body---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of
covetousness and displeasure for the world. As they meditate observing
an aspect of the body, their mind doesn't enter immersion, and their
corruptions aren't given up. But they don't take the hint. They meditate
observing an aspect of feelings ... mind ... principles---keen, aware,
and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. As they
meditate observing an aspect of principles, the mind doesn't enter
immersion, and the corruptions aren't given up. But they don't take the
hint.

That foolish, incompetent, unskillful mendicant doesn't get blissful
meditations in this very life, nor do they get mindfulness and
situational awareness. Why is that? Because they don't take their mind's
hint.

Suppose an astute, competent, skillful cook was to serve a ruler or
their chief minister with an extravagant variety of curries: superbly
sour, bitter, pungent, and sweet; hot and mild, and salty and bland.

And that cook took their master's hint: 'Today my master preferred this
sauce, or he reached for it, or he took a lot of it, or he praised it.
Today my master preferred the sour or bitter or pungent or sweet or hot
or mild or salty sauce. Or he preferred the bland sauce, or he reached
for the bland one, or he took a lot of it, or he praised it.'

That astute, competent, skillful cook gets presented with clothes,
wages, and bonuses. Why is that? Because they take their master's hint.

In the same way, an astute, competent, skillful mendicant meditates by
observing an aspect of the body---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of
covetousness and displeasure for the world. As they meditate observing
an aspect of the body, their mind enters immersion, and their
corruptions are given up. They take the hint. They meditate observing an
aspect of feelings ... mind ... principles---keen, aware, and mindful,
rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. As they meditate
observing an aspect of principles, their mind enters immersion, and
their corruptions are given up. They take the hint.

That astute, competent, skillful mendicant gets blissful meditations in
this very life, and they get mindfulness and situational awareness. Why
is that? Because they take their mind's hint."

### SN 47.9 Sick *Gilānasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Vesālī, at the little village of Beluva. There the Buddha
addressed the mendicants: "Mendicants, please enter the rainy season
residence with whatever friends or acquaintances you have around
Vesālī. I'll commence the rainy season residence right here
in the little village of Beluva."

"Yes, sir," those mendicants replied. They did as the Buddha said, while
the Buddha commenced the rainy season residence right there in the
little village of Beluva.

After the Buddha had commenced the rainy season residence, he fell
severely ill, struck by dreadful pains, close to death. But he endured
unbothered, with mindfulness and situational awareness. Then it occurred
to the Buddha:

"It would not be appropriate for me to be fully extinguished before
informing my attendants and taking leave of the mendicant
Saṅgha. Why don't I forcefully suppress this illness,
stabilize the life force, and live on?" So that is what he did. Then the
Buddha's illness died down.

Soon after the Buddha had recovered from that sickness, he left his
dwelling and sat in the shade of the porch on the seat spread out. Then
Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and
said to him:

"Sir, it's fantastic that the Buddha is comfortable, that he's keeping
well, and that he's getting by. Because when the Buddha was sick, my
body felt like it was drugged. I was disorientated, and the teachings
didn't spring to mind. Still, at least I was consoled by the thought
that the Buddha won't be fully extinguished without bringing something
up regarding the Saṅgha of mendicants."

"But what could the mendicant Saṅgha expect from me now,
Ānanda? I've taught the Dhamma without making any distinction between
secret and public teachings. The Realized One doesn't have the closed
fist of a tutor when it comes to the teachings.

If there's anyone who thinks: 'I shall lead the mendicant
Saṅgha,' or 'the Saṅgha of mendicants is meant
for me,' let them bring something up regarding the Saṅgha.
But the Realized One doesn't think like this, so why should he bring
something up regarding the Saṅgha?

Now I am old, elderly and senior. I'm advanced in years and have reached
the final stage of life. I'm currently eighty years old. Just as a
decrepit old cart keeps going by relying on straps, in the same way, the
Realized One's body keeps going as if it were relying on straps.

Sometimes the Realized One, not focusing on any signs, and with the
cessation of certain feelings, enters and remains in the signless
immersion of the heart. Only then does the Realized One's body become
more comfortable.

So Ānanda, live as your own island, your own refuge, with no other
refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other
refuge.

And how does a mendicant do this? It's when a mendicant meditates by
observing an aspect of the body---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of
covetousness and displeasure for the world. They meditate observing an
aspect of feelings ... mind ... principles---keen, aware, and mindful,
rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. That's how a
mendicant lives as their own island, their own refuge, with no other
refuge. That's how the teaching is their island and their refuge, with
no other refuge.

Whether now or after I have passed, any who shall live as their own
island, their own refuge, with no other refuge; with the teaching as
their island and their refuge, with no other refuge---those mendicants
of mine who want to train shall be among the best of the best."

### SN 47.10 The Nuns' Quarters *Bhikkhunupassayasutta*

Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and
robe, went to the nuns' quarters, and sat down on the seat spread out.
Then several nuns went up to Venerable Ānanda bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to him:

"Honorable Ānanda, several nuns meditate with their minds firmly
established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. They have
realized a higher distinction than they had before."

"That's how it is, sisters! That's how it is, sisters! Any monk or nun
who meditates with their mind firmly established in the four kinds of
mindfulness meditation can expect to realize a higher distinction than
they had before."

Then Ānanda educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired those nuns with
a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left. Then Ānanda
wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his
return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and told him what had happened.

"That's so true, Ānanda! That's so true! Any monk or nun who meditates
with their mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness
meditation can expect to realize a higher distinction than they had
before.

What four? It's when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the
body---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for
the world. As they meditate observing an aspect of the body, based on
the body there arises physical tension, or mental sluggishness, or the
mind is externally scattered. That mendicant should direct their mind
towards an inspiring subject as a basis for meditation. As they do so,
joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full
of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, one
feels bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in
samādhi. Then they reflect: 'I have accomplished the goal
for which I directed my mind. Let me now pull back.' They pull back, and
neither place the mind nor keep it connected. They understand: 'I'm
neither placing the mind nor keeping it connected. Mindful within
myself, I'm happy.'

Furthermore, a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of feelings
... mind ... principles---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness
and displeasure for the world. As they meditate observing an aspect of
principles, based on principles there arises physical tension, or mental
sluggishness, or the mind is externally scattered. That mendicant should
direct their mind towards an inspiring subject as a basis for
meditation. As they do so, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs
up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When
the body is tranquil, one feels bliss. And when blissful, the mind
becomes immersed in samādhi. Then they reflect: 'I have
accomplished the goal for which I directed my mind. Let me now pull
back.' They pull back, and neither place the mind nor keep it connected.
They understand: 'I'm neither placing the mind nor keeping it connected.
Mindful within myself, I'm happy.' That's how there is directed
development.

And how is there undirected development? Not directing their mind
externally, a mendicant understands: 'My mind is not directed
externally.' And they understand: 'Before and behind, it's
unconstricted, freed, and undirected.' And they also understand: 'I
meditate observing an aspect of the body---keen, aware, mindful; I am
happy.' Not directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands:
'My mind is not directed externally.' And they understand: 'Before and
behind, it's unconstricted, freed, and undirected.' And they also
understand: 'I meditate observing an aspect of feelings---keen, aware,
mindful; I am happy.' Not directing their mind externally, a mendicant
understands: 'My mind is not directed externally.' And they understand:
'Before and behind, it's unconstricted, freed, and undirected.' And they
also understand: 'I meditate observing an aspect of the mind---keen,
aware, mindful; I am happy.' Not directing their mind externally, a
mendicant understands: 'My mind is not directed externally.' And they
understand: 'Before and behind, it's unconstricted, freed, and
undirected.' And they also understand: 'I meditate observing an aspect
of principles---keen, aware, mindful; I am happy.' That's how there is
undirected development.

So, Ānanda, I've taught you directed development and undirected
development. Out of sympathy, I've done what a teacher should do who
wants what's best for their disciples. Here are these roots of trees,
and here are these empty huts. Practice absorption, Ānanda! Don't be
negligent! Don't regret it later! This is my instruction to you."

That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda approved what
the Buddha said.

## The Chapter at Nālandā

### SN 47.11 A Great Man *Mahāpurisasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to
one side, and said to the Buddha:

"Sir, they speak of 'a great man'. How is a great man defined?"

"Sāriputta, someone whose mind is free is a great man, I
say. If their mind is not free, I say they're not a great man.

And how does someone have a free mind? It's when a mendicant meditates
by observing an aspect of the body---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of
covetousness and displeasure for the world. As they meditate observing
an aspect of the body, their mind becomes dispassionate, and is freed
from the defilements by not grasping. They meditate observing an aspect
of feelings ... mind ... principles---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of
covetousness and displeasure for the world. As they meditate observing
an aspect of principles, their mind becomes dispassionate, and is freed
from the defilements by not grasping. That's how someone has a free
mind.

Someone whose mind is free is a great man, I say. If their mind is not
free, I say they're not a great man."

<!--pg-->
### SN 47.12 At Nāḷandā *Nālandasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Nāḷandā in
Pāvārika's mango grove. Then Sāriputta went up
to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, I have such confidence in the Buddha that I believe there's no
other ascetic or brahmin---whether past, future, or present---whose
direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening."

"That's a grand and dramatic statement, Sāriputta. You've
roared a definitive, categorical lion's roar, saying: 'I have such
confidence in the Buddha that I believe there's no other ascetic or
brahmin---whether past, future, or present---whose direct knowledge is
superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.'

What about all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived
in the past? Have you comprehended their minds to know that those
Buddhas had such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such
meditation, or such freedom?"

"No, sir."

"And what about all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who
will live in the future? Have you comprehended their minds to know that
those Buddhas will have such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom,
or such meditation, or such freedom?"

"No, sir."

"And what about me, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha at
present? Have you comprehended my mind to know that I have such ethics,
or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?"

"No, sir."

"Well then, Sāriputta, given that you don't comprehend the
minds of Buddhas past, future, or present, what exactly are you doing,
making such a grand and dramatic statement, roaring such a definitive,
categorical lion's roar?"

"Sir, though I don't comprehend the minds of Buddhas past, future, and
present, still I understand this by inference from the teaching. Suppose
there was a king's frontier citadel with fortified embankments,
ramparts, and arches, and a single gate. And it has a gatekeeper who is
astute, competent, and intelligent. He keeps strangers out and lets
known people in. As he walks around the patrol path, he doesn't see a
hole or cleft in the wall, not even one big enough for a cat to slip
out. He thinks, 'Whatever sizable creatures enter or leave the citadel,
all of them do so via this gate.'

In the same way, I understand this by inference from the teaching: 'All
the perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas---whether past, future, or
present---give up the five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that
weaken wisdom. Their mind is firmly established in the four kinds of
mindfulness meditation. They correctly develop the seven awakening
factors. And they wake up to the supreme perfect awakening.'"

"Good, good, Sāriputta! So Sāriputta, you
should frequently speak this exposition of the teaching to the monks,
nuns, laymen, and laywomen. Though there will be some silly people who
have doubt or uncertainty regarding the Realized One, when they hear
this exposition of the teaching they'll give up that doubt or
uncertainty."

### SN 47.13 With Cunda *Cundasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. At that time Venerable
Sāriputta was staying in the Magadhan lands near the little
village of Nālaka, and he was sick, suffering, gravely ill.
And the novice Cunda was his carer.

Then Venerable Sāriputta was fully extinguished from that
sickness. Then Cunda took Sāriputta's bowl and robes and
set out for Sāvatthī. He went to see Venerable Ānanda at
Jeta's grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery, bowed, sat down to
one side, and said to him:

"Sir, Venerable Sāriputta has become fully quenched. This
is his bowl and robe."

"Reverend Cunda, we should see the Buddha about this matter. Come, let's
go to the Buddha and inform him about this."

"Yes, sir," replied Cunda.

Then Ānanda and Cunda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,
and said to him:

"Sir, this novice Cunda says that Venerable Sāriputta has
become fully quenched. This is his bowl and robe. Since I heard this, my
body feels like it's drugged. I'm disorientated, and the teachings don't
spring to mind."

"Well, Ānanda, when Sāriputta was fully quenched, did he
take away your entire spectrum of ethical conduct, of immersion, of
wisdom, of freedom, or of the knowledge and vision of freedom?"

"No, sir, he did not. But Venerable Sāriputta was my
adviser and counselor. He educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired
me. He never tired of teaching the Dhamma, and he supported his
spiritual companions. I remember the nectar of the teaching, the riches
of the teaching, the support of the teaching given by Venerable
Sāriputta."

"Ānanda, did I not prepare for this when I explained that we must be
parted and separated from all we hold dear and beloved? How could it
possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to
wear out should not wear out? That is not possible.

Suppose there was a large tree standing with heartwood, and the largest
branch fell off. In the same way, in the great Saṅgha that
stands with heartwood, Sāriputta has become fully quenched.

How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and
liable to wear out should not wear out? That is not possible.

So Ānanda, live as your own island, your own refuge, with no other
refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other
refuge.

And how does a mendicant do this? It's when a mendicant meditates by
observing an aspect of the body---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of
covetousness and displeasure for the world. They meditate observing an
aspect of feelings ... mind ... principles---keen, aware, and mindful,
rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.

That's how a mendicant lives as their own island, their own refuge, with
no other refuge. That's how the teaching is their island and their
refuge, with no other refuge.

Whether now or after I have passed, any who shall live as their own
island, their own refuge, with no other refuge; with the teaching as
their island and their refuge, with no other refuge---those mendicants
of mine who want to train shall be among the best of the best."

### SN 47.14 At Ukkacelā *Ukkacelasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Vajjis near
Ukkacelā on the bank of the Ganges river, together with a
large Saṅgha of mendicants. It was not long after
Sāriputta and Moggallāna had become fully
quenched. Now, at that time the Buddha was sitting in the open,
surrounded by the Saṅgha of mendicants.

Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of mendicants, who
were silent. He addressed them:

"Mendicants, this assembly seems empty to me now that
Sāriputta and Moggallāna have become fully
quenched. When Sāriputta and Moggallāna were
alive, my assembly was never empty; I had no concern for any region
where they stayed. The Buddhas of the past or the future have pairs of
chief disciples who are no better than Sāriputta and
Moggallāna were to me.

It's an incredible and amazing quality of such disciples that they
fulfill the Teacher's instructions and follow his advice. And they're
liked and approved, respected and admired by the four assemblies.

And it's an incredible and amazing quality of the Realized One that when
such a pair of disciples becomes fully quenched he does not sorrow or
lament. How could it possibly be so that what is born, created,
conditioned, and liable to wear out should not wear out? That is not
possible.

Suppose there was a large tree standing with heartwood, and the largest
branches fell off. In the same way, in the great Saṅgha
that stands with heartwood, Sāriputta and
Moggallāna have become fully quenched.

How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and
liable to wear out should not wear out? That is not possible.

So mendicants, live as your own island, your own refuge, with no other
refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other
refuge.

And how does a mendicant do this? It's when a mendicant meditates by
observing an aspect of the body---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of
covetousness and displeasure for the world. They meditate observing an
aspect of feelings ... mind ... principles---keen, aware, and mindful,
rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.

That's how a mendicant lives as their own island, their own refuge, with
no other refuge. That's how the teaching is their island and their
refuge, with no other refuge.

Whether now or after I have passed, any who shall live as their own
island, their own refuge, with no other refuge; with the teaching as
their island and their refuge, with no other refuge---those mendicants
of mine who want to train shall be among the best of the best."

### SN 47.15 With Bāhiya *Bāhiyasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then Venerable Bāhiya went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat
down to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I've heard
it, I'll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute."

"Well then, Bāhiya, you should purify the starting point of
skillful qualities. What is the starting point of skillful qualities?
Well purified ethics and correct view. When your ethics are well
purified and your view is correct, you should develop the four kinds of
mindfulness meditation, depending on and grounded on ethics.

What four? Meditate observing an aspect of the body---keen, aware, and
mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. Meditate
observing an aspect of feelings ... mind ... principles---keen, aware,
and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. When you
develop these four kinds of mindfulness meditation, depending on and
grounded on ethics, you can expect growth, not decline, in skillful
qualities, whether by day or by night."

And then Venerable Bāhiya approved and agreed with what the
Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled
the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. Then
Bāhiya, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and
resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this
very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for
which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.

He understood: "Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been
completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further
for this place." And Venerable Bāhiya became one of the
perfected.

<!--pg-->
### SN 47.16 With Uttiya *Uttiyasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then Venerable Uttiya went up to the Buddha ... and asked him, "Sir, may
the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I've heard it, I'll
live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute."

"Well then, Uttiya, you should purify the starting point of skillful
qualities. What is the starting point of skillful qualities? Well
purified ethics and correct view. When your ethics are well purified and
your view is correct, you should develop the four kinds of mindfulness
meditation, depending on and grounded on ethics.

What four? Meditate observing an aspect of the body---keen, aware, and
mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. Meditate
observing an aspect of feelings ... mind ... principles---keen, aware,
and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. When you
develop these four kinds of mindfulness meditation, depending on and
grounded on ethics, you'll pass beyond Death's dominion."

And then Venerable Uttiya approved and agreed with what the Buddha said.
He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha,
keeping him on his right, before leaving. Then Uttiya, living alone,
withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end
of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with
his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the
lay life to homelessness.

He understood: "Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been

### SN 47.17 Noble *Ariyasutta*

"Mendicants, when these four kinds of mindfulness meditation are
developed and cultivated they are noble and emancipating, and bring one
who practices them to the complete ending of suffering. What four?

It's when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the

### SN 47.18 Divinity *Brahmasutta*

At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying in
Uruvelā at the goatherd's banyan tree on the bank of the
Nerañjarā River.

Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, "The
four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They
are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying,
to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to
realize extinguishment.

What four? A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the
body---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for
the world. Or they'd meditate observing an aspect of feelings ... or
mind ... or principles---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness
and displeasure for the world. The four kinds of mindfulness meditation
are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient
beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and
sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment."

Then the divinity Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily
as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from
the realm of divinity and reappeared in front of the Buddha. He arranged
his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha,
and said:

"That's so true, Blessed One! That's so true, Holy One! Sir, the four
kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in
order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make
an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize
extinguishment.

What four? A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the
body---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for
the world. Or they'd meditate observing an aspect of feelings ... or
mind ... or principles---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness
and displeasure for the world. The four kinds of mindfulness meditation
are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient
beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and
sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment."

That's what the divinity Sahampati said. Then he went on to say:

> "The compassionate one,\
> － who sees the ending of rebirth,\
> understands the path to convergence.\
> By this path people crossed over before,\
> will cross, and are crossing."

### SN 47.19 At Sedaka *Sedakasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sumbhas, near the
town of the Sumbhas called Sedaka. There the Buddha addressed the
mendicants:

"Once upon a time, mendicants, a pole acrobat of the corpse-workers set
up the bamboo pole of his tribe and said to his apprentice
Medakathālikā, 'Come now, dear Medakathālikā,
climb up the bamboo pole and stand on my shoulders.'

'Yes, tutor,' she replied. She climbed up the bamboo pole and stood on
her tutor's shoulders.

Then the pole acrobat of the corpse-workers said to
Medakathālikā, 'You look after me, dear
Medakathālikā, and I'll look after you. That's how,
guarding and looking after each other, we'll display our skill, collect
our fee, and get down safely from the bamboo pole.'

When he said this, Medakathālikā said to her teacher,
'That's not how it is, tutor! You should look after yourself, and I'll
look after myself. That's how, guarding and looking after ourselves,
we'll display our skill, collect our fee, and get down safely from the
bamboo pole.'

That's the way," said the Buddha. "It's just as
Medakathālikā said to her tutor. Thinking 'I'll look after
myself,' you should cultivate mindfulness meditation. Thinking 'I'll
look after others,' you should cultivate mindfulness meditation. Looking
after yourself, you look after others; and looking after others, you
look after yourself.

And how do you look after others by looking after yourself? By
development, cultivation, and practice of meditation. And how do you
look after yourself by looking after others? By acceptance,
harmlessness, love, and sympathy.

Thinking 'I'll look after myself,' you should cultivate mindfulness
meditation. Thinking 'I'll look after others,' you should cultivate
mindfulness meditation. Looking after yourself, you look after others;
and looking after others, you look after yourself."

<!--pg-->
### SN 47.20 The Finest Lady in the Land *Janapadakalyāṇīsutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in the
land of the Sumbhas, near the town of the Sumbhas called Sedaka. There
the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, suppose that on hearing, 'The finest lady in the land! The
finest lady in the land!' a large crowd would gather. And the finest
lady in the land would dance and sing in a most thrilling way. On
hearing, 'The finest lady in the land is dancing and singing! The finest
lady in the land is dancing and singing!' an even larger crowd would
gather.

Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesn't want to
die, who wants to be happy and recoils from pain. They'd say to him,
'Worthy man, this is a bowl full to the brim with oil. You must carry it
in between this large crowd and the finest lady in the land. And a man
with a drawn sword will follow right behind you. Wherever you spill even
a drop, he'll chop off your head right there.'

What do you think, mendicants? Would that person lose focus on that
bowl, and negligently get distracted outside?"

"No, sir."

"I've made up this simile to make a point. And this is what it means. 'A
bowl of oil filled to the brim' is a term for mindfulness of the body.

So you should train like this: 'We will develop mindfulness of the body.
We'll cultivate it, make it our vehicle and our basis, keep it up,
consolidate it, and properly implement it.' That's how you should
train."

retreat, went to Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one
side and said to Ānanda:

"Reverend Ānanda, the Buddha has spoken of skillful ethics. What's their
purpose?"

"Good, good, Reverend Bhadda! Your approach and articulation are
excellent, and it's a good question. For you asked: 'The Buddha has
spoken of skillful ethics. What's their purpose?'"

"Yes, reverend."

"The Buddha has spoken of skillful ethics to the extent necessary for

At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Rājagaha, in
the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding ground. Now at that time the
householder Sirivaḍḍha was sick, suffering, gravely ill.
Then he addressed a man:

"Please, worthy man, go to Venerable Ānanda, and in my name bow with
your head to his feet. Say to him: 'Sir, the householder
Sirivaḍḍha is sick, suffering, gravely ill. He bows with
his head to your feet.' And then say: 'Sir, please visit him at his home
out of sympathy.'"

"Yes, sir," that man replied. He did as Sirivaḍḍha asked.
Ānanda consented with silence.

Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and
robe, went to the home of the householder Sirivaḍḍha, sat
down on the seat spread out, and said to him:

"I hope you're keeping well, householder; I hope you're all right. And I
hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not
its growing."

"Sir, I'm not keeping well, I'm not getting by. The pain is terrible and
growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading."

"So you should train like this: 'I'll meditate observing an aspect of
the body---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure
for the world. I'll meditate on an aspect of feelings ... mind ...
principles---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and
displeasure for the world.' That's how you should train."

"These four kinds of mindfulness meditation that were taught by the
Buddha are found in me, and I exhibit them. For I meditate observing an
aspect of the body---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and
displeasure for the world. I meditate observing an aspect of feelings
... mind ... principles---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness
and displeasure for the world. And of the five lower fetters taught by

food ceases, the body ends.

Feelings originate from contact. When contact ceases, feelings end.

The mind originates from name and form. When name and form cease, the
mind ends.

Principles originate from application of mind. When application of mind
ends, principles end."

<!--pg-->
### SN 47.43 The Path *Maggasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: "Mendicants, this one time,
when I was first awakened, I was staying in Uruvelā at the
goatherd's banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.
As I was in private retreat this thought came to mind: 'The four kinds
of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order
to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end
of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize
extinguishment.

What four? A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the
body---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for
the world. Or they'd meditate observing an aspect of feelings ... or
mind ... or principles---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness
and displeasure for the world. The four kinds of mindfulness meditation
are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient
beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and
sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment.'

And then the divinity Sahampati, knowing my train of thought, as easily
as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the
realm of divinity and reappeared in front of me. He arranged his robe
over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:
'That's so true, Blessed One! That's so true, Holy One! Sir, the four
kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in
order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make
an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize
extinguishment.

What four? A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the
body---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for
the world. Or they'd meditate observing an aspect of feelings ... or
mind ... or principles---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness
and displeasure for the world. The four kinds of mindfulness meditation
are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient
beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and
sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment.'

That's what the divinity Sahampati said. Then he went on to say:

> "The compassionate one,\
> － who sees the ending of rebirth,\
> understands the path to convergence.\
> By this path people crossed over before,\
> will cross over, and are crossing over.'"

### SN 47.44 Mindful *Satisutta*

"Mendicants, a mendicant should live mindfully. This is my instruction
to you.

And how is a mendicant mindful? It's when a mendicant meditates by
observing an aspect of the body---keen, aware, and mindful, rid of
covetousness and displeasure for the world. They meditate observing an

### SN 47.45 A Heap of the Skillful *Kusalarāsisutta*

"Rightly speaking, mendicants, you'd call these four kinds of

<!--pg-->
### SN 47.46 Restraint in the Monastic Code *Pātimokkhasaṁvarasutta*

Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and
said to him:

"Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I've heard
it, I'll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute."

"Well then, mendicant, you should purify the starting point of skillful
qualities. What is the starting point of skillful qualities? Live
restrained in the monastic code, conducting yourself well and resorting
for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, keep
the rules you've undertaken. When you've done this, you should develop
the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, depending on and grounded on
ethics.

What four? Meditate observing an aspect of the body---keen, aware, and
mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. Meditate
observing an aspect of feelings ... mind ... principles---keen, aware,
and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.

When you develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation in this way,
depending on and grounded on ethics, you can expect growth, not decline,
in skillful qualities, whether by day or by night."

And then that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said.
He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha,
keeping him on his right, before leaving.

Then that mendicant, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and
resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this
very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for
which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.

He understood: "Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been
completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further
for this place." And that mendicant became one of the perfected.

### SN 47.47 Bad Conduct *Duccaritasutta*

Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha ... and said:

"Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I've heard
it, I'll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute."

"Well then, mendicant, you should purify the starting point of skillful
qualities. What is the beginning of skillful qualities? Give up bad
conduct by way of body, speech, and mind and develop good conduct by way
of body, speech, and mind. When you've done this, you should develop the
four kinds of mindfulness meditation, depending on and grounded on
ethics.

What four? Meditate observing an aspect of the body---keen, aware, and
mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. Meditate
observing an aspect of feelings ... mind ... principles---keen, aware,
and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. When you
