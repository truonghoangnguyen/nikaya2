# Linked Discourses on the Five Powers

<!--pg-->
## The Chapter of Abbreviated Texts on the Ganges

### SN 50.1--12 Sloping East, Etc. *Gaṅgāpeyyālavagga*

"Mendicants, there are these five powers. What five? The powers of
faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. These are the five
powers. The Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east. In
the same way, a mendicant who develops and cultivates the five powers
slants, slopes, and inclines to extinguishment.

And how does a mendicant who develops the five powers slant, slope, and
incline to extinguishment? It's when a mendicant develops the powers of
faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom, which rely on
seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. That's
how a mendicant who develops and cultivates the five powers slants,
slopes, and inclines to extinguishment."

> Six on slanting to the east,\
> and six on slanting to the ocean;\
> these two sixes make twelve,\
> and that's how this chapter is recited.
