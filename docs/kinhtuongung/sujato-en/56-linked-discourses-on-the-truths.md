## The Chapter on Immersion

### SN 56.1 Immersion *Samādhisutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, develop immersion. A mendicant who has immersion truly
understands. What do they truly understand? They truly understand: 'This
is suffering' ... 'This is the origin of suffering' ... 'This is the
cessation of suffering' ... 'This is the practice that leads to the
cessation of suffering'. Develop immersion. A mendicant who has
immersion truly understands.

That's why you should practice meditation to understand: 'This is
suffering' ... 'This is the origin of suffering' ... 'This is the
cessation of suffering' ... 'This is the practice that leads to the
cessation of suffering'."

### SN 56.2 Retreat *Paṭisallānasutta*

understands. What do they truly understand? They truly understand: 'This
is suffering' ... 'This is the origin of suffering' ... 'This is the
cessation of suffering' ... 'This is the practice that leads to the
cessation of suffering'. Meditate in retreat. A mendicant in retreat
truly understands.

That's why you should practice meditation to understand: 'This is
suffering' ... 'This is the origin of suffering' ... 'This is the
cessation of suffering' ... 'This is the practice that leads to the
cessation of suffering'."

### SN 56.3 A Gentleman (1st) *Paṭhamakulaputtasutta*

"Mendicants, whatever gentlemen---past, future, or present---rightly go
forth from the lay life to homelessness, all of them do so in order to
truly comprehend the four noble truths.

What four? The noble truths of suffering, the origin of suffering, the
cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of
suffering. Whatever gentlemen---past, future, or present---rightly go
forth from the lay life to homelessness, all of them do so in order to
truly comprehend the four noble truths.

What four? The noble truths of suffering, the origin of suffering, the
cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of

truly awakened to the four noble truths.

What four? The noble truths of suffering, the origin of suffering, the
cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of
suffering. ...

That's why you should practice meditation ..."

<!--pg-->
### SN 56.7 Thoughts *Vitakkasutta*

"Mendicants, don't think bad, unskillful thoughts, such as sensual,
malicious, and cruel thoughts. Why is that? Because those thoughts
aren't beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life.
They don't lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace,
insight, awakening, and extinguishment.

When you think, you should think: 'This is suffering' ... 'This is the
origin of suffering' ... 'This is the cessation of suffering' ... 'This
is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering'. Why is that?
Because those thoughts are beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals
of the spiritual life. They lead to disillusionment, dispassion,
cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.

That's why you should practice meditation ..."

<!--pg-->
### SN 56.8 Thought *Cintasutta*

"Mendicants, don't think up a bad, unskillful idea. For example: the
cosmos is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and
the body are the same thing, or they are different things; after death,
a realized one still exists, or no longer exists, or both still exists
and no longer exists, or neither still exists nor no longer exists. Why
is that? Because those thoughts aren't beneficial or relevant to the
fundamentals of the spiritual life. They don't lead to disillusionment,
dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.

When you think something up, you should think: 'This is suffering' ...
'This is the origin of suffering' ... 'This is the cessation of
suffering' ... 'This is the practice that leads to the cessation of
suffering'. Why is that? Because those thoughts are beneficial and
relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They lead to
disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and
extinguishment.

That's why you should practice meditation ..."

<!--pg-->
### SN 56.9 Arguments *Viggāhikakathāsutta*

"Mendicants, don't get into arguments, such as: 'You don't understand
this teaching and training. I understand this teaching and training.
What, you understand this teaching and training? You're practicing
wrong. I'm practicing right. I stay on topic, you don't. You said last
what you should have said first. You said first what you should have
said last. What you've thought so much about has been disproved. Your
doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine! You're trapped; get
yourself out of this---if you can!' Why is that? Because those
discussions aren't beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the
spiritual life. They don't lead to disillusionment, dispassion,
cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.

When you discuss, you should discuss: 'This is suffering' ... 'This is
the origin of suffering' ... 'This is the cessation of suffering' ...
'This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering'. ...

That's why you should practice meditation ..."

<!--pg-->
### SN 56.10 Low Talk *Tiracchānakathāsutta*

"Mendicants, don't engage in all kinds of low talk, such as talk about
kings, bandits, and ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars;
talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and
fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and
countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and talk at the
well; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and
talk about being reborn in this or that place. Why is that? Because
those discussions aren't beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of
the spiritual life. They don't lead to disillusionment, dispassion,
cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.

When you discuss, you should discuss: 'This is suffering' ... 'This is
the origin of suffering' ... 'This is the cessation of suffering' ...
'This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering'. ...

That's why you should practice meditation ..."

## The Chapter on Rolling Forth the Wheel of Dhamma

### SN 56.11 Rolling Forth the Wheel of Dhamma *Dhammacakkappavattanasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Varanasi, in the deer park at
Isipatana. There the Buddha addressed the group of five mendicants:

"Mendicants, these two extremes should not be cultivated by one who has
gone forth. What two? Indulgence in sensual pleasures, which is low,
crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. And indulgence in
self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and pointless. Avoiding
these two extremes, the Realized One understood the middle way of
practice, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct
knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment.

And what is that middle way of practice? It is simply this noble
eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right
action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right
immersion. This is that middle way of practice, which gives vision and
knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and
extinguishment.

Now this is the noble truth of suffering. Rebirth is suffering; old age
is suffering; illness is suffering; death is suffering; association with
the disliked is suffering; separation from the liked is suffering; not
getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping
aggregates are suffering.

Now this is the noble truth of the origin of suffering. It's the craving
that leads to future lives, mixed up with relishing and greed, taking
pleasure wherever it lands. That is, craving for sensual pleasures,
craving to continue existence, and craving to end existence.

Now this is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering. It's the
fading away and cessation of that very same craving with nothing left
over; giving it away, letting it go, releasing it, and not clinging to
it.

Now this is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation
of suffering. It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right
view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right
effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.

'This is the noble truth of suffering.' Such was the vision, knowledge,
wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not
learned before from another. 'This noble truth of suffering should be
completely understood.' Such was the vision that arose in me ... 'This
noble truth of suffering has been completely understood.' Such was the
vision that arose in me ...

'This is the noble truth of the origin of suffering.' Such was the
vision that arose in me ... 'This noble truth of the origin of suffering
should be given up.' Such was the vision that arose in me ... 'This
noble truth of the origin of suffering has been given up.' Such was the
vision that arose in me ...

'This is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering.' Such was the
vision that arose in me ... 'This noble truth of the cessation of
suffering should be realized.' Such was the vision that arose in me ...
'This noble truth of the cessation of suffering has been realized.' Such
was the vision that arose in me ...

'This is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of
suffering.' Such was the vision that arose in me ... 'This noble truth
of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering should be
developed.' Such was the vision that arose in me ... 'This noble truth
of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering has been
developed.' Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and
light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from
another.

As long as my true knowledge and vision about these four noble truths
was not fully purified in these three rounds and twelve aspects, I
didn't announce my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its
gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its
ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.

But when my true knowledge and vision about these four noble truths was
fully purified in these three rounds and twelve aspects, I announced my
supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods,
Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics
and brahmins, its gods and humans.

Knowledge and vision arose in me: 'My freedom is unshakable; this is my
last rebirth; now there'll be no more future lives.'"

That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the group of five mendicants
approved what the Buddha said.

And while this discourse was being spoken, the stainless, immaculate
vision of the Dhamma arose in Venerable Koṇḍañña:
"Everything that has a beginning has an end."

And when the Buddha rolled forth the Wheel of Dhamma, the earth gods
raised the cry: "Near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana, the
Buddha has rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel
cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or
Māra or divinity or by anyone in the world."

Hearing the cry of the earth gods, the gods of the four great kings ...
the gods of the thirty-three ... the gods of Yama ... the joyful gods
... the gods who love to imagine ... the gods who control what is
imagined by others ... the gods of the Divinity's host raised the cry:
"Near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Buddha has rolled
forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back
by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or by
anyone in the world."

And so at that moment, that second, that hour, the cry soared up to the
realm of divinity. And this ten-thousandfold galaxy shook and rocked and
trembled. And an immeasurable, magnificent light appeared in the world,
surpassing the glory of the gods.

Then the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:
"Koṇḍañña has really understood! Koṇḍañña has
really understood!"

And that's how Venerable Koṇḍañña came to be known as
"Koṇḍañña Who Understood".

### SN 56.12 The Realized Ones *Tathāgatasutta*

"'This is the noble truth of suffering.' Such was the vision, knowledge,
wisdom, realization, and light that arose in the Realized Ones regarding
teachings not learned before from another. 'This noble truth of
suffering should be completely understood.' ... 'This noble truth of
suffering has been completely understood.' ...

'This is the noble truth of the origin of suffering.' ... 'This noble
truth of the origin of suffering should be given up.' ... 'This noble
truth of the origin of suffering has been given up.' ...

suffering.' ... 'This noble truth of the practice that leads to the
cessation of suffering should be developed.' ... 'This noble truth of
the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering has been

light that arose in the Realized Ones regarding teachings not learned
before from another."

### SN 56.13 Aggregates *Khandhasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these four noble truths. What four? The noble
truths of suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of
suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.

And what is the noble truth of suffering? You should say: 'The five
grasping aggregates'. That is: form, feeling, perception, choices, and
consciousness. This is called the noble truth of suffering.

And what is the noble truth of the origin of suffering? It's the craving
that leads to future lives, mixed up with relishing and greed, taking
pleasure wherever it lands. That is, craving for sensual pleasures,
craving to continue existence, and craving to end existence. This is
called the noble truth of the origin of suffering.

And what is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering? It's the
fading away and cessation of that very same craving with nothing left
over; giving it away, letting it go, releasing it, and not clinging to
it. This is called the noble truth of the cessation of suffering.

view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right
effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. This is called the noble
truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. These
are the four noble truths.

That's why you should practice meditation ..."

truths of suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of
suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.

And what is the noble truth of suffering? You should say: 'The six
interior sense fields'. What six? The sense fields of the eye, ear,
nose, tongue, body, and mind. This is called the noble truth of
suffering. ..."

### SN 56.15 Remembering (1st) *Paṭhamadhāraṇasutta*

"Mendicants, do you remember the four noble truths that I taught?" When
he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha:

"I do, sir."

"How so, mendicant?"

"Sir, I remember that suffering is the first noble truth you've taught;
the origin of suffering is the second; the cessation of suffering is the
third; and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering is the
fourth. That's how I remember the four noble truths as you've taught
them."

"Good, good, mendicant! It's good that you remember the four noble
truths as I've taught them. Suffering is the first noble truth I've
taught, and that's how you should remember it. The origin of suffering
is the second; the cessation of suffering is the third; and the practice

he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha:

"I do, sir."

"How so, mendicant?"

"Sir, I remember that suffering is the first noble truth you've taught.
For if any ascetic or brahmin should say this: 'What the ascetic Gotama
teaches is not the first noble truth of suffering. I'll reject this
first noble truth of suffering and describe another first noble truth of
suffering.' That is not possible. The origin of suffering ... The
cessation of suffering ... The practice that leads to the cessation of
suffering is the fourth noble truth you've taught. For if any ascetic or
brahmin should say this: 'What the ascetic Gotama teaches is not the
fourth noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of

### SN 56.17 Ignorance *Avijjāsutta*

Seated to one side, that mendicant said to the Buddha:

And how is an ignorant person defined?"

"Not knowing about suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of
suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.
This is called ignorance. And this is how an ignorant person is defined.

## The Chapter at the Village of Koṭi

### SN 56.21 At the Village of Koṭi (1st) *Paṭhamakoṭigāmasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Vajjis at the
village of Koṭi. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
"Mendicants, due to not understanding and not penetrating four noble
truths, both you and I have wandered and transmigrated for such a very
long time.

What four? The noble truths of suffering, the origin of suffering, the
cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of
suffering. These noble truths of suffering, origin, cessation, and the
path have been understood and comprehended. Craving for continued
existence has been cut off; the conduit to rebirth is ended; now
there'll be no more future lives."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "Because of not truly seeing\
> the four noble truths,\
> we have transmigrated for a long time\
> from one rebirth to the next.
>
> But now that these truths have been seen,\
> the conduit to rebirth is eradicated.\

### SN 56.22 At the Village of Koṭi (2nd) *Dutiyakoṭigāmasutta*

"Mendicants, there are ascetics and brahmins who don't truly understand
about suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. I don't deem
them as true ascetics and brahmins. Those venerables don't realize the
goal of life as an ascetic or brahmin, and don't live having realized it
with their own insight.

There are ascetics and brahmins who do truly understand about suffering,
its origin, its cessation, and the path. I deem them as true ascetics

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

At one time several mendicants were staying in the land of the

in the pavilion and this discussion came up among them:

"Reverends, does someone who sees suffering also see the origin of
suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to
the cessation of suffering?"

When they said this, Venerable Gavampati said to those senior
mendicants:

"Reverends, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
'Someone who sees suffering also sees the origin of suffering, the
cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of
suffering. Someone who sees the origin of suffering also sees suffering,
the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation
of suffering. Someone who sees the cessation of suffering also sees
suffering, the origin of suffering, and the practice that leads to the
cessation of suffering. Someone who sees the practice that leads to the
cessation of suffering also sees suffering, the origin of suffering, and
the cessation of suffering.'"

## The Chapter in a Rosewood Forest

### SN 56.31 In a Rosewood Forest *Sīsapāvanasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī in a
rosewood forest. Then the Buddha picked up a few rosewood leaves in his
hand and addressed the mendicants: "What do you think, mendicants? Which
is more: the few leaves in my hand, or those in the forest above me?"

"Sir, the few leaves in your hand are a tiny amount. There are far more
leaves in the forest above."

"In the same way, there is much more that I have directly known but have
not explained to you. What I have explained is a tiny amount. And why
haven't I explained it? Because it's not beneficial or relevant to the
fundamentals of the spiritual life. It doesn't lead to disillusionment,
dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.
That's why I haven't explained it.

And what have I explained? I have explained: 'This is suffering' ...
'This is the origin of suffering' ... 'This is the cessation of
suffering' ... 'This is the practice that leads to the cessation of
suffering'.

And why have I explained this? Because it's beneficial and relevant to

"Mendicants, suppose a stick was tossed up in the air. Sometimes it'd
fall on its bottom and sometimes the top. It's the same for sentient
beings roaming and transmigrating, shrouded by ignorance and fettered by
craving. Sometimes they go from this world to the other world, and
sometimes they come from the other world to this world. Why is that?
It's because they haven't seen the four noble truths. What four? The
noble truths of suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.

"Sir, if our clothes or head were on fire, we'd apply intense

situational awareness in order to extinguish it."

"Mendicants, so long as you have not comprehended the four noble truths,
regard your burning head or clothes with equanimity, ignore them, and
apply intense enthusiasm, effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance,
mindfulness, and situational awareness to truly comprehending the four
noble truths. What four? The noble truths of suffering, its origin, its
cessation, and the path.

"Mendicants, suppose there was a man with a lifespan of a hundred years.
And someone might say to him: 'Come now, my good man, they'll strike you
with a hundred spears in the morning, at midday, and in the late
afternoon. And you'll live for a hundred years being struck with three
hundred spears every day. But when a hundred years have passed, you will
comprehend the four noble truths for the first time.'

For an earnest gentleman this is sufficient reason to submit.

Why is that? Transmigration has no known beginning. No first point is
found of blows by spears, swords, arrows, and axes. Now this may be so.
But the comprehension of the four noble truths doesn't come with pain or
sadness, I say. Rather, the comprehension of the four noble truths comes
only with pleasure and happiness, I say. What four? The noble truths of
suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.

### SN 56.36 Living Creatures *Pāṇasutta*

"Suppose a person was to strip all the grass, sticks, branches, and
leaves in the Black Plum Tree Land, gather them together into one pile,
and make them into stakes. Then they'd impale the large creatures in the
ocean on large stakes; the medium-sized creatures on medium-sized
stakes; and the small creatures on small stakes. They wouldn't run out
of sizable creatures in the ocean before using up all the grass, sticks,
branches, and leaves in the Black Plum Tree Land. There are far more
small creatures in the ocean than this, so it wouldn't be feasible to
impale them on stakes. Why is that? Because of the small size of those
life-forms. That's how big the plane of loss is.

A person accomplished in view, exempt from that vast plane of loss,
truly understands: 'This is suffering' ... 'This is the origin of
suffering' ... 'This is the cessation of suffering' ... 'This is the

up by the wind and landed on level ground. The east wind wafts it west;

## The Chapter on a Cliff

### SN 56.41 Speculation About the World *Lokacintāsutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the
Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding ground. There the Buddha addressed
the mendicants:

"Once upon a time, mendicants, a certain person left
Rājagaha, thinking 'I'll speculate about the world.' They
went to the Sumāgadhā lotus pond and sat down on the bank
speculating about the world. Then that person saw an army of four
divisions enter a lotus stalk. When he saw this he thought, 'I've gone
mad, really, I've lost my mind! I'm seeing things that don't exist in
the world.'

Then that person entered the city and informed a large crowd, 'I've gone
mad, really, I've lost my mind! I'm seeing things that don't exist in
the world.'

'But how is it that you're mad? How have you lost your mind? And what
have you seen that doesn't exist in the world?'

'Sirs, I left Rājagaha, thinking "I'll speculate about the
world." I went to the Sumāgadhā lotus pond and sat down on
the bank speculating about the world. Then I saw an army of four
divisions enter a lotus stalk. That's why I'm mad, that's why I've lost
my mind. And that's what I've seen that doesn't exist in the world.'

'Well, worthy man, you're definitely mad, you've definitely lost your
mind. And you're seeing things that don't exist in the world.'

But what that person saw was in fact real, not unreal. Once upon a time,
a battle was fought between the gods and the titans. In that battle the
gods won and the titans lost. The defeated and terrified titans entered
the citadel of the titans through the lotus stalk only to confuse the
gods.

So mendicants, don't speculate about the world. For example: the cosmos
is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the
body are the same thing, or they are different things; after death, a
realized one still exists, or no longer exists, or both still exists and
no longer exists, or neither still exists nor no longer exists. Why is
that? Because those thoughts aren't beneficial or relevant to the
fundamentals of the spiritual life. They don't lead to disillusionment,
dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.

When you think something up, you should think: 'This is suffering' ...
'This is the origin of suffering' ... 'This is the cessation of
suffering' ... 'This is the practice that leads to the cessation of
suffering'. Why is that? Because those thoughts are beneficial and
relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They lead to
disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and
extinguishment.

### SN 56.42 A Cliff *Papātasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the
Vulture's Peak Mountain.

Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, "Come, mendicants, let's go to
Inspiration Peak for the day's meditation."

"Yes, sir," they replied. Then the Buddha together with several
mendicants went to Inspiration Peak.

A certain mendicant saw the big cliff there and said to the Buddha,
"Sir, that big cliff is really huge and scary. Is there any other cliff
bigger and scarier than this one?"

"There is, mendicant."

"But sir, what is it?"

"Mendicant, there are ascetics and brahmins who don't truly understand
about suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. They take
pleasure in choices that lead to rebirth, old age, and death, to sorrow,
lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. Since they take pleasure in
such choices, they continue to make them. Having made choices that lead
to rebirth, old age, and death, to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness,

Whatever odor you smell ... Whatever flavor you taste ... Whatever touch
you feel ... Whatever idea you know with your mind is unlikable, not
likable; undesirable, not desirable; unpleasant, not pleasant."

mighty and terrifying than this one?"

"There is, mendicant."

### SN 56.45 Splitting Hairs *Vālasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the
Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.

Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and
robe, entered Vesālī for alms. He saw several Licchavi
youths practicing archery near the town hall. They were shooting arrows
from a distance through a small keyhole, shot after shot without
missing.

When he saw this he thought, "These Licchavi youths really are trained,
so well trained, in that they shoot arrows from a distance through a
small keyhole, shot after shot without missing."

Then Ānanda wandered for alms in Vesālī. After the meal, on
his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and told him what had happened.

"What do you think, Ānanda? Which is harder and more challenging: to
shoot arrows from a distance through a small keyhole, shot after shot
without missing? Or to take a horsehair split into seven strands and
penetrate one tip with another tip?"

"It's more difficult and challenging, sir, to take a horsehair split
into seven strands and penetrate one tip with another tip."

"Still, Ānanda, those who truly penetrate suffering, its origin, its
cessation, and the path penetrate something tougher than that.

darkness really is mighty, so very mighty. Is there any other darkness
more mighty and terrifying than this one?"

"There is, mendicant."

"But sir, what is it?"

"There are ascetics and brahmins who don't truly understand about

hundred years.

What do you think, mendicants? Would that one-eyed turtle, popping up

yoke?"

"Only after a very long time, sir, if ever."

"That one-eyed turtle would poke its neck through the hole in that yoke
sooner than a fool who has fallen to the underworld would be reborn as a
human being, I say.

conduct, and no doing what is good and skillful. There they just prey on
each other, preying on the weak. Why is that? It's because they haven't

that has dried up and evaporated, or the two or three drops left?"

"Sir, the water in the ocean that has dried up and evaporated is
certainly more. The two or three drops left are tiny. Compared to the
water in the ocean that has dried up and evaporated, it doesn't count,
there's no comparison, it's not worth a fraction."

"In the same way, for a noble disciple ...

That's why you should practice meditation ..."

### SN 56.59 A Mountain (1st) *Paṭhamapabbatūpamasutta*

"Mendicants, suppose a person was to place seven pebbles the size of
mustard seeds on the Himalayas, the king of mountains.

What do you think, mendicants? Which is more: the seven pebbles the size
of mustard seeds, or the Himalayas, the king of mountains?"

"Sir, the Himalayas, the king of mountains, is certainly more. The seven
pebbles the size of mustard seeds are tiny. Compared to the Himalayas,
they don't count, there's no comparison, they're not worth a fraction."

### SN 56.60 A Mountain (2nd) *Dutiyapabbatūpamasutta*

"Mendicants, suppose the Himalayas, the king of mountains, was worn away
and eroded except for seven pebbles the size of mustard seeds.

What do you think, mendicants? Which is more: the portion of the
Himalayas, the king of mountains, that has been worn away and eroded, or
the seven pebbles the size of mustard seeds that are left?"

"Sir, the portion of the Himalayas, the king of mountains, that has been
worn away and eroded is certainly more. The seven pebbles the size of
mustard seeds are tiny. Compared to the Himalayas, they don't count,
there's no comparison, they're not worth a fraction."

"In the same way, for a person with comprehension, a noble disciple
accomplished in view, the suffering that's over and done with is more,
what's left is tiny. Compared to the mass of suffering in the past
that's over and done with, it doesn't count, there's no comparison, it's
not worth a fraction, since there are at most seven more lives. Such a
person truly understands about suffering, its origin, its cessation, and
the path.

That's why you should practice meditation ..."

### SN 56.61 Not Human *Aññatrasutta*

Then the Buddha, picking up a little bit of dirt under his fingernail,
addressed the mendicants: "What do you think, mendicants? Which is more:
the little bit of dirt under my fingernail, or this great earth?"

"Sir, the great earth is certainly more. The little bit of dirt under
your fingernail is tiny. Compared to the great earth, it doesn't count,
there's no comparison, it's not worth a fraction."

"In the same way, the sentient beings reborn as humans are few, while
those not reborn as humans are many. Why is that? It's because they
haven't seen the four noble truths. What four? The noble truths of

suffering.

suffering' ... 'This is the origin of suffering' ... 'This is the
cessation of suffering' ... 'This is the practice that leads to the
cessation of suffering'."

That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants approved what
the Buddha said.
