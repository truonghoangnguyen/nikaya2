## The Chapter on Mountains

### N 46.1 The Himalaya *Himavantasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, dragons grow and wax strong supported by the Himalayas, the
king of mountains. When they're strong they dive into the pools. Then
they dive into the lakes, the streams, the rivers, and finally the
ocean. There they acquire a great and abundant body.

In the same way, a mendicant develops and cultivates the seven awakening
factors depending on and grounded on ethics, acquiring great and
abundant good qualities. And how does a mendicant develop the seven
awakening factors depending on and grounded on ethics, acquiring great
and abundant good qualities?

It's when a mendicant develops the awakening factor of mindfulness,
which relies on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripens as
letting go.

They develop the awakening factor of investigation of principles ...

They develop the awakening factor of energy ...

They develop the awakening factor of rapture ...

They develop the awakening factor of tranquility ...

They develop the awakening factor of immersion ...

They develop the awakening factor of equanimity, which relies on
seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripens as letting go.

That's how a mendicant develops and cultivates the seven awakening
factors depending on and grounded on ethics, acquiring great and
abundant good qualities."

### N 46.2 The Body *Kāyasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, this body is sustained by food. It depends on food to
continue, and without food it doesn't continue. In the same way, the
five hindrances are sustained by fuel. They depend on fuel to continue,
and without fuel they don't continue.

And what fuels the arising of sensual desire, or, when it has arisen,
makes it increase and grow? There is the feature of beauty. Frequent
irrational application of mind to that fuels the arising of sensual
desire, or, when it has arisen, makes it increase and grow.

And what fuels the arising of ill will, or, when it has arisen, makes it
increase and grow? There is the feature of harshness. Frequent
irrational application of mind to that fuels the arising of ill will,
or, when it has arisen, makes it increase and grow.

And what fuels the arising of dullness and drowsiness, or, when they
have arisen, makes them increase and grow? There is discontent, sloth,
yawning, sleepiness after eating, and mental sluggishness. Frequent
irrational application of mind to them fuels the arising of dullness and
drowsiness, or, when they have arisen, makes them increase and grow.

And what fuels the arising of restlessness and remorse, or, when they
have arisen, makes them increase and grow? There is the unsettled mind.
Frequent irrational application of mind to that fuels the arising of
restlessness and remorse, or, when they have arisen, makes them increase
and grow.

And what fuels the arising of doubt, or, when it has arisen, makes it
increase and grow? There are things that are grounds for doubt. Frequent
irrational application of mind to them fuels the arising of doubt, or,
when it has arisen, makes it increase and grow.

This body is sustained by food. It depends on food to continue, and
without food it doesn't continue. In the same way, the five hindrances
are sustained by fuel. They depend on fuel to continue, and without fuel
they don't continue.

This body is sustained by food. It depends on food to continue, and
without food it doesn't continue. In the same way, the seven awakening
factors are sustained by fuel. They depend on fuel to continue, and
without fuel they don't continue.

And what fuels the arising of the awakening factor of mindfulness, or,
when it has arisen, fully develops it? There are things that are grounds
for the awakening factor of mindfulness. Frequent rational application
of mind to them fuels the arising of the awakening factor of
mindfulness, or, when it has arisen, fully develops it.

And what fuels the arising of the awakening factor of investigation of
principles, or, when it has arisen, fully develops it? There are
qualities that are skillful and unskillful, blameworthy and blameless,
inferior and superior, and those on the side of dark and bright.
Frequent rational application of mind to them fuels the arising of the
awakening factor of investigation of principles, or, when it has arisen,
fully develops it.

And what fuels the arising of the awakening factor of energy, or, when
it has arisen, fully develops it? There are the elements of initiative,
persistence, and exertion. Frequent rational application of mind to them
fuels the arising of the awakening factor of energy, or, when it has
arisen, fully develops it.

And what fuels the arising of the awakening factor of rapture, or, when
it has arisen, fully develops it? There are things that are grounds for
the awakening factor of rapture. Frequent rational application of mind
to them fuels the arising of the awakening factor of rapture, or, when
it has arisen, fully develops it.

And what fuels the arising of the awakening factor of tranquility, or,
when it has arisen, fully develops it? There is tranquility of the body
and of the mind. Frequent rational application of mind to that fuels the
arising of the awakening factor of tranquility, or, when it has arisen,
fully develops it.

And what fuels the arising of the awakening factor of immersion, or,
when it has arisen, fully develops it? There are things that are the
basis of serenity and freedom from distraction. Frequent rational
application of mind to them fuels the arising of the awakening factor of
immersion, or, when it has arisen, fully develops it.

And what fuels the arising of the awakening factor of equanimity, or,
when it has arisen, fully develops it? There are things that are grounds
for the awakening factor of equanimity. Frequent rational application of
mind to them fuels the arising of the awakening factor of equanimity,
or, when it has arisen, fully develops it.

This body is sustained by food. It depends on food to continue, and
without food it doesn't continue. In the same way, the seven awakening
factors are sustained by fuel. They depend on fuel to continue, and
without fuel they don't continue."

### N 46.3 Ethics *Sīlasutta*

"Mendicants, when a mendicant is accomplished in ethics, immersion,
knowledge, freedom, or the knowledge and vision of freedom, even the
sight of them is very helpful, I say. Even to hear them, approach them,
pay homage to them, recollect them, or go forth following them is very
helpful, I say. Why is that? Because after hearing the teaching of such
mendicants, a mendicant will live withdrawn in both body and mind, as
they recollect and think about that teaching.

At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of
mindfulness; they develop it and perfect it. As they live mindfully in
this way they investigate, explore, and inquire into that teaching with
wisdom.

At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of
investigation of principles; they develop it and perfect it. As they
investigate principles with wisdom in this way their energy is roused up
and unflagging.

At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of
energy; they develop it and perfect it. When they're energetic, rapture
not of the flesh arises.

At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of
rapture; they develop it and perfect it. When the mind is full of
rapture, the body and mind become tranquil.

At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of
tranquility; they develop it and perfect it. When the body is tranquil
and one feels bliss, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.

At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of
immersion; they develop it and perfect it. They closely watch over that
mind immersed in samādhi.

At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of
equanimity; they develop it and perfect it.

When the seven awakening factors are developed and cultivated in this
way they can expect seven fruits and benefits. What seven? They attain
enlightenment early on in this very life. If not, they attain
enlightenment at the time of death. If not, with the ending of the five
lower fetters, they're extinguished between one life and the next. If
not, with the ending of the five lower fetters they're extinguished upon
landing. If not, with the ending of the five lower fetters they're
extinguished without extra effort. If not, with the ending of the five
lower fetters they're extinguished with extra effort. If not, with the
ending of the five lower fetters they head upstream, going to the
Akaniṭṭha realm. When the seven awakening factors are
developed and cultivated in this way these are the seven fruits and
benefits they can expect."

### N 46.4 Clothes *Vatthasutta*

At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants:
"Reverends, mendicants!"

"Reverend," they replied. Sāriputta said this:

"There are these seven awakening factors. What seven? The awakening
factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture,
tranquility, immersion, and equanimity. These are the seven awakening
factors.

In the morning, I meditate on whichever of these seven awakening factors
I want. At midday, and in the evening, I meditate on whichever of these
seven awakening factors I want. If it's the awakening factor of
mindfulness, I know that it's limitless and that it's properly
implemented. While it remains I understand that it remains. And if it
subsides in me I understand the specific reason it subsides. ... If it's
the awakening factor of equanimity, I know that it's limitless and that
it's properly implemented. While it remains I understand that it
remains. And if it subsides I understand the specific reason it
subsides.

Suppose that a ruler or their chief minister had a chest full of
garments of different colors. In the morning, they'd don whatever pair
of garments they wanted. At midday, and in the evening, they'd don
whatever pair of garments they wanted.

In the same way, in the morning, at midday, and in the evening, I
meditate on whichever of these seven awakening factors I want. If it's
the awakening factor of mindfulness, I know that it's limitless and that
it's properly implemented. While it remains I understand that it
remains. And if it subsides I understand the specific reason it
subsides. ... If it's the awakening factor of equanimity, I know that
it's limitless and that it's properly implemented. While it remains I
understand that it remains. And if it subsides I understand the specific
reason it subsides."

### N 46.5 A Monk *Bhikkhusutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha ... and asked him, "Sir, they
speak of the 'awakening factors'. How are the awakening factors
defined?"

"Mendicant, they're called awakening factors because they lead to
awakening.

A mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation
of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity,
which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as
letting go. As they develop the seven awakening factors, their mind is
freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and
ignorance. When they're freed, they know they're freed. They understand:
'Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to
be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.'

They're called awakening factors because they lead to awakening."

### N 46.6 Kuṇḍaliya *Kuṇḍaliyasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāketa in the deer
park at the Añjana Wood. Then the wanderer
Kuṇḍaliya went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings
with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat
down to one side and said to the Buddha:

"Worthy Gotama, I like to hang around the monasteries and visit the
assemblies. When I've finished breakfast, it's my habit to wander from
monastery to monastery, from park to park. There I see some ascetics and
brahmins speaking for the sake of winning debates and finding fault. But
what benefit does the worthy Gotama live for?"

"The benefit the Realized One lives for, Kuṇḍaliya, is the
fruit of knowledge and freedom."

"But what things must be developed and cultivated in order to fulfill
knowledge and freedom?"

"The seven awakening factors."

"But what things must be developed and cultivated in order to fulfill
the seven awakening factors?"

"The four kinds of mindfulness meditation."

"But what things must be developed and cultivated in order to fulfill
the four kinds of mindfulness meditation?"

"The three kinds of good conduct."

"But what things must be developed and cultivated in order to fulfill
the three kinds of good conduct?"

"Sense restraint.

And Kuṇḍaliya, how is sense restraint developed and
cultivated so as to fulfill the three kinds of good conduct? A mendicant
sees an agreeable sight with their eye. They don't desire it or enjoy
it, and they don't give rise to greed. Their mind and body are steady
internally, well settled and well freed. But if they see a disagreeable
sight they're not dismayed; their mind isn't hardened, dejected, or full
of ill will. Their mind and body are steady internally, well settled and
well freed.

Furthermore, a mendicant hears an agreeable sound with the ear ...
smells an agreeable odor with the nose ... tastes an agreeable flavor
with the tongue ... feels an agreeable touch with the body ... knows an
agreeable idea with their mind. They don't desire it or enjoy it, and
they don't give rise to greed. Their mind and body are steady
internally, well settled and well freed. But if they know a disagreeable
idea they're not dismayed; their mind isn't hardened, dejected, or full
of ill will. Their mind and body are steady internally, well settled and
well freed.

When a mendicant's mind and body are steady internally, they're well
settled and well freed when it comes to both agreeable and disagreeable
sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and ideas. That's how sense
restraint is developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the three kinds
of good conduct.

And how are the three kinds of good conduct developed and cultivated so
as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation? A mendicant
gives up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develops good
conduct by way of body, speech, and mind. That's how the three kinds of
good conduct are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four
kinds of mindfulness meditation.

And how are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation developed and
cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors? A mendicant
meditates by observing an aspect of the body---keen, aware, and mindful,
rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. They meditate
observing an aspect of feelings ... mind ... principles---keen, aware,
and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. That's
how the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are developed and
cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors.

And how are the seven awakening factors developed and cultivated so as
to fulfill knowledge and freedom? A mendicant develops the awakening
factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture,
tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading
away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. That's how the seven
awakening factors are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill
knowledge and freedom."

When he said this, the wanderer Kuṇḍaliya said to the
Buddha, "Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the
overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the
lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see
what's there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. I
go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the
mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the worthy
Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."

### N 46.7 A Bungalow *Kūṭāgārasutta*

"Mendicants, the rafters of a bungalow all slant, slope, and incline to
the peak. In the same way, a mendicant who develops and cultivates the
seven awakening factors slants, slopes, and inclines to extinguishment.

And how does a mendicant who develops the seven awakening factors slant,
slope, and incline to extinguishment? It's when a mendicant develops the
awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy,
rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on
seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. That's
how a mendicant who develops and cultivates the seven awakening factors
slants, slopes, and inclines to extinguishment."

### N 46.8 With Upavāna *Upavānasutta*

At one time the venerables Upavāna and
Sāriputta were staying near Kosambī, in
Ghosita's Monastery. Then in the late afternoon, Venerable
Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable
Upavāna and exchanged greetings with him. When the
greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and
said to Upavāna:

"Reverend Upavāna, can a mendicant know by investigating
inside themselves that the seven awakening factors are well implemented
so that they lead to living at ease?"

"They can, Reverend Sāriputta.

As a mendicant rouses up the awakening factor of mindfulness, they
understand: 'My mind is well freed. I've eradicated dullness and
drowsiness, and eliminated restlessness and remorse. My energy is roused
up, and my mind is sharply focused, not sluggish.' ...

As they rouse up the awakening factor of equanimity, they understand:
'My mind is well freed. I've eradicated dullness and drowsiness, and
eliminated restlessness and remorse. My energy is roused up, and my mind
is sharply focused, not sluggish.'

That's how a mendicant can know by investigating inside themselves that
the seven awakening factors are well implemented so that they lead to
living at ease."

### N 46.9 Arisen (1st) *Paṭhamauppannasutta*

"Mendicants, these seven awakening factors don't arise to be developed
and cultivated except when a Realized One, a perfected one, a fully
awakened Buddha has appeared. What seven? The awakening factors of
mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility,
immersion, and equanimity. These seven awakening factors don't arise to
be developed and cultivated except when a Realized One, a perfected one,
a fully awakened Buddha has appeared."

"Mendicants, these seven awakening factors don't arise to be developed
and cultivated apart from the Holy One's training. What seven? The
awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy,
rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity. These seven awakening
factors don't arise to be developed and cultivated apart from the Holy
One's training."

## The Chapter on Sick

### N 46.11 Living Creatures *Pāṇasutta*

"Mendicants, living creatures engage in the four postures: sometimes
walking, sometimes standing, sometimes sitting, sometimes lying down.
They do so depending on the earth and grounded on the earth. In the same
way, a mendicant develops and cultivates the seven awakening factors
depending on and grounded on ethics.

And how does a mendicant develop the seven awakening factors depending
on and grounded on ethics? It's when a mendicant develops the awakening
factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture,
tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading
away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. That's how a mendicant
develops and cultivates the seven awakening factors depending on and
grounded on ethics."

the same way, for a mendicant good friendship is the forerunner and
precursor of the arising of the seven awakening factors. A mendicant
with good friends can expect to develop and cultivate the seven
awakening factors.

And how does a mendicant with good friends develop and cultivate the
seven awakening factors? It's when a mendicant develops the awakening
factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture,

forerunner and precursor of the arising of the seven awakening factors.
A mendicant accomplished in rational application of mind can expect to
develop and cultivate the seven awakening factors.

And how does a mendicant with rational application of mind develop and
cultivate the seven awakening factors? It's when a mendicant develops
the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles,

how a mendicant with rational application of mind develops and
cultivates the seven awakening factors."

### N 46.14 Sick (1st) *Paṭhamagilānasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the
Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding ground. Now at that time Venerable
Mahākassapa was staying in the Pipphali cave, and he was
sick, suffering, gravely ill. Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha
came out of retreat, went to Venerable Mahākassapa, sat
down on the seat spread out, and said to him:

"I hope you're keeping well, Kassapa; I hope you're all right. And I
hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not
its growing."

"Sir, I'm not keeping well, I'm not getting by. The pain is terrible and

The awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles,
energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity." When he said
this, Udāyī said to him:

"Sir, how are the seven awakening factors developed and cultivated so as
to lead to the ending of craving?"

"Udāyī, it's when a mendicant develops the awakening factor
of mindfulness, which relies on seclusion, fading away, and cessation,
and ripens as letting go. And it is abundant, expansive, limitless, and
free of ill will. As they do so, craving is given up. When craving is
given up, deeds are given up. When deeds are given up, suffering is
given up. ...

A mendicant develops the awakening factor of equanimity, which relies on
seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripens as letting go. And it
is abundant, expansive, limitless, and free of ill will. As they do so,
craving is given up. When craving is given up, deeds are given up. When
deeds are given up, suffering is given up.

And so, Udāyī, when craving ends, deeds end; when deeds end
suffering ends."

### N 46.30 With Udāyī *Udāyisutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sumbhas, near the
town of the Sumbhas called Sedaka. Then Venerable Udāyī
went up to the Buddha ... and said to him:

"It's incredible, sir, it's amazing! How helpful my love and respect for
the Buddha have been, and my sense of conscience and prudence. For when
I was still a layman, I wasn't helped much by the teaching or the
Saṅgha. But when I considered my love and respect for the
Buddha, and my sense of conscience and prudence, I went forth from the
lay life to homelessness. The Buddha taught me the Dhamma: 'Such is
form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is
feeling ... Such is perception ... Such are choices ... Such is
consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending
of consciousness.'

Then, while staying in an empty hut, I followed the churning of the five
grasping aggregates. I truly understood: 'This is suffering' ... 'This
is the origin of suffering' ... 'This is the cessation of suffering' ...
'This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering'. I
comprehended the teaching; I acquired the path. When developed and
cultivated as I'm living in such a way, it will bring me to such a state
that I will understand: 'Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has
been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing
further for this place.'

I acquired the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of
principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity.
When developed and cultivated as I'm living in such a way, they will
bring me to such a state that I will understand: 'Rebirth is ended, the
spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done,
there is nothing further for this place.' This is the path that I
acquired. When developed and cultivated as I'm living in such a way, it
will bring me to such a state that I will understand: 'Rebirth is ended,
the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been
done, there is nothing further for this place.'"

"Good, good, Udāyī! For that is indeed the path that you
acquired. When developed and cultivated as you're living in such a way,
it will bring you to such a state that you will understand: 'Rebirth is
ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has
been done, there is nothing further for this place.'"

### N 46.52 Is There a Way? *Pariyāyasutta*

Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls
and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. Then it occurred to
him, "It's too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī. Why
don't we visit the monastery of the wanderers of other religions?"

Then they went to the monastery of the wanderers of other religions and
exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. When the greetings and
polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. The wanderers
said to them:

"Reverends, the ascetic Gotama teaches his disciples like this:
'Mendicants, please give up the five hindrances---corruptions of the
heart that weaken wisdom---and truly develop the seven awakening
factors.' We too teach our disciples: 'Reverends, please give up the
five hindrances---corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom---and
truly develop the seven awakening factors.' What, then, is the
difference between the ascetic Gotama's teaching and instruction and
ours?"

Those mendicants neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the
wanderers of other religions. They got up from their seat, thinking:

"We will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself."
Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to
the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.

"Mendicants, when wanderers of other religions say this, you should say
to them: 'But reverends, is there a way in which the five hindrances
become ten and the seven awakening factors become fourteen?' Questioned
like this, the wanderers of other religions would be stumped, and, in
addition, would get frustrated. Why is that? Because they're out of
their element. I don't see anyone in this world---with its gods,
Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics
and brahmins, its gods and humans---who could provide a satisfying
answer to these questions except for the Realized One or his disciple or
someone who has heard it from them.

And what is the way in which the five hindrances become ten? Sensual
desire for what is internal is a hindrance; and sensual desire for what
is external is also a hindrance. That's how what is concisely referred
to as 'the hindrance of sensual desire' becomes twofold. Ill will for
what is internal is a hindrance; and ill will for what is external is
also a hindrance. That's how what is concisely referred to as 'the
hindrance of ill will' becomes twofold. Dullness is a hindrance; and
drowsiness is also a hindrance. That's how what is concisely referred to
as 'the hindrance of dullness and drowsiness' becomes twofold.
Restlessness is a hindrance; and remorse is also a hindrance. That's how
what is concisely referred to as 'the hindrance of restlessness and
remorse' becomes twofold. Doubt about internal things is a hindrance;
and doubt about external things is also a hindrance. That's how what is
concisely referred to as 'the hindrance of doubt' becomes twofold. This
is the way in which the five hindrances become ten.

And what is the way in which the seven awakening factors become
fourteen? Mindfulness of internal things is the awakening factor of
mindfulness; and mindfulness of external things is also the awakening
factor of mindfulness. That's how what is concisely referred to as 'the
awakening factor of mindfulness' becomes twofold.

Investigating, exploring, and inquiring into internal things with wisdom
is the awakening factor of investigation of principles; and
investigating, exploring, and inquiring into external things with wisdom
is also the awakening factor of investigation of principles. That's how
what is concisely referred to as 'the awakening factor of investigation
of principles' becomes twofold.

Physical energy is the awakening factor of energy; and mental energy is
also the awakening factor of energy. That's how what is concisely
referred to as 'the awakening factor of energy' becomes twofold.

Rapture while placing the mind and keeping it connected is the awakening
factor of rapture; and rapture without placing the mind and keeping it
connected is also the awakening factor of rapture. In this way what is
concisely referred to as 'the awakening factor of rapture' becomes
twofold.

Physical tranquility is the awakening factor of tranquility; and mental
tranquility is also the awakening factor of tranquility. In this way
what is concisely referred to as 'the awakening factor of tranquility'
becomes twofold.

Immersion while placing the mind and keeping it connected is the
awakening factor of immersion; and immersion without placing the mind
and keeping it connected is also the awakening factor of immersion. In
this way what is concisely referred to as 'the awakening factor of
immersion' becomes twofold.

Equanimity for internal things is the awakening factor of equanimity;
and equanimity for external things is also the awakening factor of
equanimity. In this way what is concisely referred to as 'the awakening
factor of equanimity' becomes twofold. This is the way in which the
seven awakening factors become fourteen."

### N 46.53 Fire *Aggisutta*

Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls
and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms.

**(The same as the previous discourse.)**

"Mendicants, when wanderers of other religions say this, you should say
to them: 'Reverends, which awakening factors should not be developed
when the mind is sluggish? And which awakening factors should be
developed at that time? Which awakening factors should not be developed
when the mind is restless? And which awakening factors should be
developed at that time?' Questioned like this, the wanderers of other
religions would be stumped, and, in addition, would get frustrated. Why
is that? Because they're out of their element.

I don't see anyone in this world---with its gods, Māras,
and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods
and humans---who could provide a satisfying answer to these questions
except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it
from them.

When the mind is sluggish, it's the wrong time to develop the awakening
factors of tranquility, immersion, and equanimity. Why is that? Because
it's hard to stimulate a sluggish mind with these things.

Suppose someone wanted to make a small fire flare up. If they toss wet
grass, cow-dung, and timber on it, spray it with water, and scatter dirt
on it, could they make it flare up?"

"No, sir."

"In the same way, when the mind is sluggish, it's the wrong time to
develop the awakening factors of tranquility, immersion, and equanimity.
Why is that? Because it's hard to stimulate a sluggish mind with these
things.

When the mind is sluggish, it's the right time to develop the awakening
factors of investigation of principles, energy, and rapture. Why is
that? Because it's easy to stimulate a sluggish mind with these things.

Suppose someone wanted to make a small fire flare up. If they toss dry
grass, cow-dung, and timber on it, blow on it, and don't scatter dirt on
it, could they make it flare up?"

"Yes, sir."

"In the same way, when the mind is sluggish, it's the right time to
develop the awakening factors of investigation of principles, energy,
and rapture. Why is that? Because it's easy to stimulate a sluggish mind
with these things.

When the mind is restless, it's the wrong time to develop the awakening
factors of investigation of principles, energy, and rapture. Why is
that? Because it's hard to settle a restless mind with these things.

Suppose someone wanted to extinguish a great mass of fire. If they toss
dry grass, cow-dung, and timber on it, blow on it, and don't scatter
dirt on it, could they extinguish it?"

"No, sir."

"In the same way, when the mind is restless, it's the wrong time to
develop the awakening factors of investigation of principles, energy,
and rapture. Why is that? Because it's hard to settle a restless mind

"Yes, sir."

"In the same way, when the mind is restless, it's the right time to
develop the awakening factors of tranquility, immersion, and equanimity.
Why is that? Because it's easy to settle a restless mind with these
things. But mindfulness is always useful, I say."

### N 46.54 Full of Love *Mettāsahagatasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Koliyans, where
they have a town called Haliddavasana. Then several mendicants robed up
in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Haliddavasana
for alms. Then it occurred to them, "It's too early to wander for alms
in Haliddavasana. Why don't we visit the monastery of the wanderers of
other religions?"

Then they went to the monastery of the wanderers of other religions and
exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. When the greetings and
polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. The wanderers
said to them:

"Reverends, the ascetic Gotama teaches his disciples like this: 'Come,
mendicants, give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that
weaken wisdom, and meditate spreading a heart full of love to one
direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In
the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, spread a
heart full of love to the whole world---abundant, expansive, limitless,
free of enmity and ill will. Meditate spreading a heart full of
compassion to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to
the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all
around, spread a heart full of compassion to the whole world---abundant,
expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. Meditate spreading a
heart full of rejoicing to one direction, and to the second, and to the
third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across,
everywhere, all around, spread a heart full of rejoicing to the whole
world---abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
Meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to
the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above,
below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of
equanimity to the whole world---abundant, expansive, limitless, free of
enmity and ill will.'

We too teach our disciples in just the same way. What, then, is the
difference between the ascetic Gotama's teaching and instruction and
ours?"

Those mendicants neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the
wanderers of other religions. They got up from their seat, thinking:

"We will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself."
Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to
the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.

"Mendicants, when wanderers of other religions say this, you should say
to them: 'But reverends, how is the heart's release by love developed?
What is its destination, apex, fruit, and culmination? How is the
heart's release by compassion developed? What is its destination, apex,
fruit, and end? How is the heart's release by rejoicing developed? What
is its destination, apex, fruit, and end? How is the heart's release by
equanimity developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end?'
Questioned like this, the wanderers of other religions would be stumped,
and, in addition, would get frustrated. Why is that? Because they're out
of their element. I don't see anyone in this world---with its gods,
Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics
and brahmins, its gods and humans---who could provide a satisfying
answer to these questions except for the Realized One or his disciple or
someone who has heard it from them.

And how is the heart's release by love developed? What is its
destination, apex, fruit, and end? It's when a mendicant develops the
heart's release by love together with the awakening factors of
mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility,
immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and
cessation, and ripen as letting go. If they wish: 'May I meditate
perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,' that's what they do. If
they wish: 'May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive,'
that's what they do. If they wish: 'May I meditate perceiving the
repulsive in the unrepulsive and the repulsive,' that's what they do. If
they wish: 'May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive
and the unrepulsive,' that's what they do. If they wish: 'May I meditate
staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and
the unrepulsive,' that's what they do. The apex of the heart's release
by love is the beautiful, I say, for a mendicant who has not penetrated
to a higher freedom.

And how is the heart's release by compassion developed? What is its
destination, apex, fruit, and end? It's when a mendicant develops the
heart's release by compassion together with the awakening factors of
mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility,
immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and
cessation, and ripen as letting go. If they wish: 'May I meditate
perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,' that's what they do. ...
If they wish: 'May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware,
rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive,' that's what they do.
Or else, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of
perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity,
aware that 'space is infinite', they enter and remain in the dimension
of infinite space. The apex of the heart's release by compassion is the
dimension of infinite space, I say, for a mendicant who has not
penetrated to a higher freedom.

And how is the heart's release by rejoicing developed? What is its
destination, apex, fruit, and end? It's when a mendicant develops the
heart's release by rejoicing together with the awakening factors of
mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility,
immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and
cessation, and ripen as letting go. If they wish: 'May I meditate
perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,' that's what they do. ...
If they wish: 'May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware,
rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive,' that's what they do.
Or else, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware
that 'consciousness is infinite', they enter and remain in the dimension
of infinite consciousness. The apex of the heart's release by rejoicing
is the dimension of infinite consciousness, I say, for a mendicant who
has not penetrated to a higher freedom.

And how is the heart's release by equanimity developed? What is its
destination, apex, fruit, and end? It's when a mendicant develops the
heart's release by equanimity together with the awakening factors of
mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility,
immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and
cessation, and ripen as letting go. If they wish: 'May I meditate
perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,' that's what they do. If
they wish: 'May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive,'
that's what they do. If they wish: 'May I meditate perceiving the
repulsive in the unrepulsive and the repulsive,' that's what they do. If
they wish: 'May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive
and the unrepulsive,' that's what they do. If they wish: 'May I meditate
staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and
the unrepulsive,' that's what they do. Or else, going totally beyond the
dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that 'there is nothing at
all', they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness. The apex of
the heart's release by equanimity is the dimension of nothingness, I
say, for a mendicant who has not penetrated to a higher freedom."

### N 46.55 With Saṅgārava *Saṅgāravasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then Saṅgārava the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and
exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation
were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:

"What is the cause, worthy Gotama, what is the reason why sometimes even
hymns that are long-practiced don't spring to mind, let alone those that
are not practiced? And why is it that sometimes even hymns that are
long-unpracticed spring to mind, let alone those that are practiced?"

"Brahmin, there's a time when your heart is overcome and mired in
sensual desire and you don't truly understand the escape from sensual
desire that has arisen. At that time you don't truly know or see what is
good for yourself, good for another, or good for both. Even hymns that
are long-practiced don't spring to mind, let alone those that are not
practiced.

Suppose there was a bowl of water that was mixed with dye such as red
lac, turmeric, indigo, or rose madder. Even a person with clear eyes
checking their own reflection wouldn't truly know it or see it.

In the same way, when your heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire
... Even hymns that are long-practiced don't spring to mind, let alone
those that are not practiced.

Furthermore, when your heart is overcome and mired in ill will ... Even
hymns that are long-practiced don't spring to mind, let alone those that
are not practiced.

Suppose there was a bowl of water that was heated by fire, boiling and
bubbling. Even a person with clear eyes checking their own reflection
wouldn't truly know it or see it.

In the same way, when your heart is overcome and mired in ill will ...
Even hymns that are long-practiced don't spring to mind, let alone those
that are not practiced.

Furthermore, when your heart is overcome and mired in dullness and
drowsiness ... Even hymns that are long-practiced don't spring to mind,
let alone those that are not practiced.

Suppose there was a bowl of water overgrown with moss and aquatic
plants. Even a person with clear eyes checking their own reflection
wouldn't truly know it or see it.

In the same way, when your heart is overcome and mired in dullness and
drowsiness ... Even hymns that are long-practiced don't spring to mind,
let alone those that are not practiced.

Furthermore, when your heart is overcome and mired in restlessness and
remorse ... Even hymns that are long-practiced don't spring to mind, let
alone those that are not practiced.

Suppose there was a bowl of water stirred by the wind, churning,
swirling, and rippling. Even a person with clear eyes checking their own
reflection wouldn't truly know it or see it.

In the same way, when your heart is overcome and mired in restlessness
and remorse ... Even hymns that are long-practiced don't spring to mind,
let alone those that are not practiced.

Furthermore, when your heart is overcome and mired in doubt ... Even
hymns that are long-practiced don't spring to mind, let alone those that
are not practiced.

Suppose there was a bowl of water that was cloudy, murky, and muddy,
hidden in the darkness. Even a person with clear eyes checking their own
reflection wouldn't truly know it or see it.

In the same way, there's a time when your heart is overcome and mired in
doubt and you don't truly understand the escape from doubt that has
arisen. At that time you don't truly know or see what is good for
yourself, good for another, or good for both. Even hymns that are
long-practiced don't spring to mind, let alone those that are not
practiced. This is the cause, brahmin, this is the reason why sometimes
even hymns that are long-practiced don't spring to mind, let alone those
that are not practiced.

There's a time when your heart is not overcome and mired in sensual
desire and you truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has
arisen. At that time you truly know and see what is good for yourself,
good for another, and good for both. Even hymns that are
long-unpracticed spring to mind, let alone those that are practiced.

desire ... Even hymns that are long-unpracticed spring to mind, let
alone those that are practiced.

Furthermore, when your heart is not overcome and mired in ill will ...
Even hymns that are long-unpracticed spring to mind, let alone those

would truly know it and see it.

and drowsiness ... Even hymns that are long-unpracticed spring to mind,
let alone those that are practiced.

and remorse ... Even hymns that are long-unpracticed spring to mind, let
alone those that are practiced.

Suppose there is a bowl of water that is not stirred by the wind,
churning, swirling, and rippling. A person with clear eyes checking
their own reflection would truly know it and see it.

In the same way, when your heart is not overcome and mired in
restlessness and remorse ... Even hymns that are long-unpracticed spring
to mind, let alone those that are practiced.

Furthermore, when your heart is not overcome and mired in doubt ... Even
hymns that are long-unpracticed spring to mind, let alone those that are
practiced.

Suppose there was a bowl of water that was transparent, clear, and
unclouded, brought into the light. A person with clear eyes checking
their own reflection would truly know it and see it.

In the same way, there's a time when your heart is not overcome and
mired in doubt and you truly understand the escape from doubt that has
arisen. At that time you truly know and see what is good for yourself,
good for another, and good for both. Even hymns that are
long-unpracticed spring to mind, let alone those that are practiced.
This is the cause, brahmin, this is the reason why sometimes even hymns
that are long-unpracticed do spring to mind, let alone those that are
practiced.

These seven awakening factors are not obstacles, hindrances, or
corruptions of the mind. When developed and cultivated they lead to the
realization of the fruit of knowledge and freedom. What seven? The
awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy,
rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity. These seven awakening
factors are not obstacles, hindrances, or corruptions of the mind. When
developed and cultivated they lead to the realization of the fruit of
knowledge and freedom."

When he said this, Saṅgārava said to the Buddha,
"Excellent, worthy Gotama! ... From this day forth, may the worthy
Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."

### N 46.56 With Prince Abhaya *Abhayasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, on the Vulture's Peak Mountain. Then Prince
Abhaya went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to
him:

"Sir, Pūraṇa Kassapa says this: 'There is no cause or
reason for not knowing and not seeing. Not knowing and not seeing have
no cause or reason. There is no cause or reason for knowing and seeing.
Knowing and seeing have no cause or reason.' What does the Buddha say
about this?"

"Prince, there are causes and reasons for not knowing and not seeing.
Not knowing and not seeing have causes and reasons. There are causes and
reasons for knowing and seeing. Knowing and seeing have causes and
reasons."

"But sir, what is the cause and reason for not knowing and not seeing?
How do not knowing and not seeing have causes and reasons?"

"There's a time when the heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire,
without truly knowing and seeing the escape from sensual desire that has
arisen. This is a cause and reason for not knowing and not seeing. And
this is how not knowing and not seeing have causes and reasons.

Furthermore, there's a time when the heart is overcome and mired in ill
will ... dullness and drowsiness ... restlessness and remorse ... doubt,
without truly knowing and seeing the escape from doubt that has arisen.
This is a cause and reason for not knowing and not seeing. And this is
how not knowing and not seeing have causes and reasons."

"Sir, what is the name of this exposition of the teaching?"

"These are called the 'hindrances', prince."

"Indeed, Blessed One, these are hindrances! Indeed, Holy One, these are
hindrances! Overcome by even a single hindrance you wouldn't truly know
or see, let alone all five hindrances.

But sir, what is the cause and reason for knowing and seeing? How do
knowing and seeing have causes and reasons?"

"It's when a mendicant develops the awakening factor of mindfulness,
which relies on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripens as
letting go. They truly know and see with a mind that has developed the
awakening factor of mindfulness. This is a cause and reason for knowing
and seeing. And this is how knowing and seeing have causes and reasons.

Furthermore, a mendicant develops the awakening factor of investigation
of principles ... energy ... rapture ... tranquility ... immersion ...
equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and
ripen as letting go. They truly know and see with a mind that has
developed the awakening factor of equanimity. This is a cause and reason
for knowing and seeing. And this is how knowing and seeing have causes
and reasons."

"Sir, what is the name of this exposition of the teaching?"

"These are called the 'awakening factors', prince."

"Indeed, Blessed One, these are awakening factors! Indeed, Holy One,
these are awakening factors! Endowed with even a single awakening factor
you would truly know and see, let alone all seven awakening factors.
When climbing Mount Vulture's Peak I became fatigued in body and mind.
But this has now faded away. And I've comprehended the teaching."

formless realm, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. These are the five
higher fetters. The seven awakening factors should be developed for the
direct knowledge, complete understanding, finishing, and giving up of
these five higher fetters.

What seven? It's when a mendicant develops the awakening factors of
mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility,
immersion, and equanimity, which culminate in the removal of greed,
hate, and delusion. ..."
