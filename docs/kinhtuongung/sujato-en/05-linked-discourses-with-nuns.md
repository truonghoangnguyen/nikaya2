## The Chapter on Nuns

### N 5.1 With Āḷavikā *Āḷavikāsutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery.

Then the nun Āḷavikā robed up in the morning and, taking
her bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. She wandered
for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on her return from
almsround, she went to the Dark Forest seeking seclusion.

Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the nun
Āḷavikā feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make
her fall away from seclusion, went up to her and addressed her in verse:

> "There's no escape in the world,\
> so what will seclusion do for you?\
> Enjoy erotic delights;\
> don't regret it later."

Then the nun Āḷavikā thought, "Who's speaking this verse, a
human or a non-human?"

Then she thought, "This is Māra the Wicked, wanting to make
me feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make me fall away from
seclusion!"

Then Āḷavikā, knowing that this was Māra the
Wicked, replied to him in verse:

> "There is an escape in the world,\
> and I've personally experienced it with wisdom.\
> O Wicked One, kinsman of the negligent,\
> you don't know that place.
>
> Sensual pleasures are like swords and spears;\
> the aggregates are their chopping block.\
> What you call erotic delight\
> has become no delight for me."

Then Māra the Wicked, thinking, "The nun
Āḷavikā knows me!" miserable and sad, vanished right there.

deep into it, and sat at the root of a tree to meditate.

Then she thought, "This is Māra the Wicked, wanting to make
me feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make me fall away from
immersion!"

Then Somā, knowing that this was Māra the
Wicked, replied to him in verse:

> "What difference does womanhood make\
> when the mind is serene,\
> and knowledge is present\
> as you rightly discern the Dhamma.
>
> Surely someone who might think:\
> 'I am woman', or 'I am man',\
