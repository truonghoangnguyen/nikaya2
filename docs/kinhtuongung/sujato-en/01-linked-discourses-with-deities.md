# Linked Discourses With Deities

## The Chapter on a Reed

### N 1.1 Crossing the Flood *Oghataraṇasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
Monastery.

Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta's
Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,
"Good fellow, how did you cross the flood?"

"Neither standing nor swimming, good sir, I crossed the flood."

"But in what way did you cross the flood neither standing nor swimming?"

"When I stood, I sank under. When I swam, I was swept away. That's how I
crossed the flood neither standing nor swimming."

> "After a long time I see\
> a brahmin fully quenched.\
> Neither standing nor swimming,\
> he's crossed over clinging to the world."

This is what that deity said, and the teacher approved. Then that deity,
knowing that the teacher approved, bowed and respectfully circled the
Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.

Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta's
Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,
"Good fellow, do you understand liberation, emancipation, and seclusion
for sentient beings?"

"I do, sir."

"But how is it that you understand liberation, emancipation, and
seclusion for sentient beings?"

"Because I have ended relish for rebirth, and finished with perception
and consciousness. Due to the cessation and stilling of feelings, that,
good sir, is how I understand liberation, emancipation, and seclusion
for sentient beings."

<!--pg-->
## The Chapter on the Garden of Delight

### N 1.11 The Garden of Delight *Nandanasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Once upon a time, mendicants, a certain deity of the company of the
thirty-three was amusing themselves in the Garden of Delight, escorted
by a band of nymphs, and supplied and provided with the five kinds of
heavenly sensual stimulation. On that occasion they recited this verse:

> 'They don't know pleasure\
> who don't see the Garden of Delight!\
> It's the abode of lordly gods,\
> the glorious host of Thirty!'

When they had spoken, another deity replied with this verse:

<!--pg-->
### N 1.13 There's Nothing Like a Child *Natthiputtasamasutta*

Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha's

> discontent, and grogginess after eating:\
> when this is energetically fended off,\
> the noble path is purified."

<!--pg-->
### N 1.17 Hard to Do *Dukkarasutta*

> "Hard to do, hard to endure,\
> is the ascetic life for the inept,\
> for it has many narrow passes\
> where the fool founders."
>
> "How many days could an ascetic live\
> without controlling the mind?\
> They'd founder with each step,\
> under the sway of thoughts.
>
> A mendicant should collect their thoughts\
> as a tortoise draws its limbs into its shell.\
> Independent, not disturbing others,\
> quenched: they wouldn't blame anyone."

<!--pg-->
### N 1.18 Conscience *Hirīsutta*

> "Can a person constrained by conscience\
> be found in the world?\
> Who shies away from blame,\

### N 1.19 Little Hut *Kuṭikāsutta*

> It's good you have no little nest!\
> It's good you have no networks!\
> And good that you're free from shackles."

<!--pg-->
### N 1.20 With Samiddhi *Samiddhisutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Monastery.

Then Venerable Samiddhi rose at the crack of dawn and went to the hot
springs to bathe. When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood
in one robe drying his limbs.

Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire hot
springs, went up to Samiddhi, and, standing in the air, addressed him in
verse:

> "Mendicant, you seek alms before you eat;\
> you wouldn't seek alms after eating.\
> But you should eat first, then seek alms:\
> don't let the time pass you by."
>
> "I actually don't know the time;\
> it's hidden and unseen.\
> That's why I seek alms before eating,\
> so that the time may not pass me by!"

Then that deity landed on the ground and said to Samiddhi, "You've gone
forth while young, mendicant. With pristine black hair, you're blessed
with youth, in the prime of life, and you've never flirted with sensual
pleasures. Enjoy human sensual pleasures! Don't give up what is apparent
in the present to chase after what takes effect over time."

"I'm not, good fellow; I'm giving up what takes effect over time to
chase after what is apparent in the present. For the Buddha has said
that sensual pleasures take effect over time, with much suffering and
distress, and they're all the more full of drawbacks. But this teaching
is apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting
inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for
themselves."

"But in what way, mendicant, has the Buddha said that sensual pleasures
take effect over time, with much suffering and distress, and they're all
the more full of drawbacks? And how is this teaching apparent in the
present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so
that sensible people can know it for themselves?"

"I'm junior, good fellow, recently gone forth, newly come to this
teaching and training. I'm not able to explain this in detail. But the
Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha is staying
near Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Monatery. You should go to
him and ask about this matter. And you should remember it in line with
the Buddha's answer."

"It's not easy for us to approach the Buddha, as he is surrounded by
other illustrious deities. If you go to the Buddha and ask him about
this matter, we'll come along and listen to the teaching."

"Yes, good fellow," Venerable Samiddhi replied. He went to the Buddha,
bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then he
added:

"Sir, if that deity spoke the truth, he'll be close by."

When he had spoken, that deity said to Samiddhi, "Ask, mendicant, ask!
For I have arrived."

Then the Buddha addressed the deity in verse:

> "Sentient beings who perceive the communicable,\
> become established in the communicable.\
> Not understanding the communicable,\
> they fall under the yoke of Death.
>
> But having fully understood the communicable,\
> they don't conceive a communicator,\
> for they have nothing\
> by which they might be described.

Tell me if you understand, spirit."

"I don't understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha's brief
statement. Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed
meaning."

> "If you think that 'I'm equal,\
> special, or worse', you'll get into arguments.\
> Unwavering in the face of the three discriminations,\
> you'll have no thought 'I'm equal or special'.

"I don't understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha's brief
statement. Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed
meaning."

> "Assessment was given up, conceit rejected;\
> craving for name and form was cut off right here.\
> They cut the ties, untroubled,\
> － with no need for hope.\
> Though gods and humans search for them\
> in this world and the world beyond,\
> － they never find them,\
> not in heaven nor in any abode.

Tell me if you understand, spirit."

"This is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha's brief
statement:

> You should never do anything bad\
> by speech or mind or body in all the world.\
> Having given up sensual pleasures,\
> － mindful and aware,\
> you shouldn't keep doing\
> － what's painful and pointless."

## The Chapter on a Sword

### N 1.21 A Sword *Sattisutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the Buddha's
presence:

> "Like they're struck by a sword,\
> like their head was on fire,\
> a mendicant, mindful, should go forth,\
> to give up sensual desire."
>
> "Like they're struck by a sword,\
> like their head was on fire,\
> a mendicant, mindful, should go forth,\
> to give up substantialist view."

<!--pg-->
### N 1.22 Impact *Phusatisutta*

> "It doesn't impact a person who doesn't impact others.\

>
> "Whoever wrongs a man who's done no wrong,\
> a pure man who has not a blemish,\
> the evil backfires on the fool,\
> like fine dust thrown upwind."

<!--pg-->
### N 1.23 A Tangle *Jaṭāsutta*

> "Tangled within, tangled without:\

> "A wise person grounded in ethics,\
> developing the mind and wisdom,\
> a keen and alert mendicant---\
> they can untangle this tangle.
>
> Those in whom greed, hate, and ignorance\
> have faded away;\
> the perfected ones with defilements ended---\
> they have untangled the tangle.
>
> And where name and form\
> cease with nothing left over;\
> as well as impingement and perception of form:\
> it's there that the tangle is cut."

<!--pg-->
### N 1.24 Shielding the Mind *Manonivāraṇasutta*

> "Whatever you've shielded the mind from\
> can't cause you suffering.\
> So you should shield the mind from everything,\

>
> "You needn't shield the mind from everything.\
> When the mind is under control,\
> you need only shield the mind\
> from where the bad things come."

<!--pg-->
### N 1.25 A Perfected One *Arahantasutta*

> "When a mendicant is perfected, proficient,\
> with defilements ended, bearing the final body:\
> would they say, 'I speak',\
> or even 'they speak to me'?"
>
> "When a mendicant is perfected, proficient,\
> with defilements ended, bearing the final body:\
> they would say, 'I speak',\
> and also 'they speak to me'.\
> Skillful, understanding the world's labels,\
> they'd use these terms as no more than expressions."
>
> "When a mendicant is perfected, proficient,\
> with defilements ended, bearing the final body:\
> is such a mendicant drawing close to conceit\
> if they'd say, 'I speak',\
> or even 'they speak to me'?"
>
> "Someone who has given up conceit has no ties,\
> the ties of conceit are all dissipated.\
> Though that intelligent person has transcended conceiving,\
> they'd still say, 'I speak',
>
> and also 'they speak to me'.\
> Skillful, understanding the world's labels,\
> they'd use these terms as no more than expressions."

<!--pg-->
### N 1.26 Lamps *Pajjotasutta*

> "How many lamps are there\
> that light up the world?\
> We've come to ask you, sir:\
> how are we to understand this?"
>
> "There are four lamps in the world,\
> a fifth is not found.\
> The sun blazes by day,\

### N 1.27 Streams *Sarasutta*

> from here the streams turn back;\

<!--pg-->
### N 1.28 Affluent *Mahaddhanasutta*

> "The affluent and the wealthy,\
> even the aristocrats who rule the land,\
> are jealous of each other,\
> insatiable in sensual pleasures.
>
> Among those of such an avid nature,\
> flowing along the stream of lives,\
> who here has given up craving?\
> Who in the world is not avid?"
>
> "Having given up their home, their child, their cattle,\

> they in the world are not avid."

<!--pg-->
### N 1.29 Four Wheels *Catucakkasutta*

<!--pg-->
## The Chapter on the Satullapa Group

### N 1.31 Virtuous *Sabbhisutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
Monastery.

Then, late at night, several glorious deities of the Satullapa Group,
lighting up the entire Jeta's Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and
stood to one side. Standing to one side, one deity recited this verse in
the Buddha's presence:

> "Associate only with the virtuous!\
> Try to get close to the virtuous!\
> Understanding the true teaching of the good,\
> things get better, not worse."

Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "Associate only with the virtuous!\
> Try to get close to the virtuous!\
> Understanding the true teaching of the good,\
> wisdom is gained---but not from anyone else."

Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "Associate only with the virtuous!\
> Try to get close to the virtuous!\
> Understanding the true teaching of the good,\
> you grieve not among the grieving."

Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "Associate only with the virtuous!\
> Try to get close to the virtuous!\
> Understanding the true teaching of the good,\
> you shine among your relatives."

Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "Associate only with the virtuous!\
> Try to get close to the virtuous!\
> Understanding the true teaching of the good,\
> sentient beings go to a good place."

Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "Associate only with the virtuous!\
> Try to get close to the virtuous!\
> Understanding the true teaching of the good,\
> sentient beings live happily."

Then another deity said to the Buddha, "Sir, who has spoken well?"

"You've all spoken well in your own way. However, listen to me also:

> Associate only with the virtuous!\
> Try to get close to the virtuous!\
> Understanding the true teaching of the good,\
> you're released from all suffering."

That is what the Buddha said. Then those deities, knowing that the
teacher approved, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him
on their right, before vanishing right there.

### N 1.32 Stinginess *Maccharisutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

Then, late at night, several glorious deities of the Satullapa Group,
lighting up the entire Jeta's Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and
stood to one side. Standing to one side, one deity recited this verse in
the Buddha's presence:

> "Because of stinginess and negligence\
> a gift is not given.\
> Wanting merit,\
> a smart person would give."

Then another deity recited these verses in the Buddha's presence:

> "When a miser fails to give because of fear,\
> the very thing they're afraid of comes to pass.\
> The hunger and thirst\
> that a miser fears\
> hurt the fool\
> in this world and the next.
>
> So you should dispel stinginess,\
> overcoming that stain, and give a gift.\
> The good deeds of sentient beings\
> support them in the next world."

Then another deity recited these verses in the Buddha's presence:

> "Among the dead they do not die,\
> those who, like fellow travelers on the road,\
> are happy to provide, though they have but little.\
> This is an ancient teaching.
>
> Some who have little are happy to provide,\
> while some who have much don't wish to give.\
> An offering given from little\
> is multiplied a thousand times."

Then another deity recited these verses in the Buddha's presence:

> "Giving what's hard to give,\
> doing what's hard to do;\
> the wicked don't act like this,\
> for the teaching of the good is hard to follow.
>
> That's why the virtuous and the wicked\
> have different destinations after here.\
> The wicked go to hell,\
> while the virtuous are bound for heaven."

Then another deity said to the Buddha, "Sir, who has spoken well?"

"You've all spoken well in your own way. However, listen to me also:

> A hundred thousand people\
> － making a thousand sacrifices\
> isn't worth a fraction\
> of one who lives rightly, wandering for gleanings,\
> or one who supports their partner\
> － from what little they have."

Then another deity addressed the Buddha in verse:

> "Why doesn't that sacrifice of theirs, so abundant and magnificent,\
> equal the value of a moral person's gift?\
> How is it that a hundred thousand people\
> － making a thousand sacrifices\
> isn't worth a fraction\
> － of what's offered by such a person?"
>
> "Some give based on immorality---\
> after injuring, killing, and tormenting.\
> Such an offering---tearful, violent---\
> in no way equals the value of a moral person's gift.
>
> That's how it is that a hundred thousand people\
> － making a thousand sacrifices\
> isn't worth a fraction\
> － of what's offered by such a person."

### N 1.33 Good *Sādhusutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then, late at night, several glorious deities of the Satullapa Group,
lighting up the entire Jeta's Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and
stood to one side. Standing to one side, one deity expressed this
heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha's presence:

> "Good, sir, is giving!\
> Because of stinginess and negligence\
> a gift is not given.\
> Wanting merit,\
> a smart person would give."

Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha's
presence:

> "Good, sir, is giving!\
> Even when one has little, giving is good.
>
> Some who have little are happy to provide,\
> while some who have much don't wish to give.\
> An offering given from little\
> is multiplied a thousand times."

Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha's
presence:

> "Good, sir, is giving!\
> Even when one has little, giving is good.\
> And it's also good to give out of faith.\
> Giving and warfare are similar, they say,\
> for even a few of the good may conquer the many.\
> If a faithful person gives even a little,\
> it still brings them happiness in the hereafter."

Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha's
presence:

> "Good, sir, is giving!\
> Even when one has little, giving is good.\
> And it's also good to give out of faith.\
> And it's also good to give legitimate wealth.
>
> A man who gives legitimate wealth,\
> earned by his efforts and initiative,\
> has passed over Yama's Vetaraṇi River;\
> that mortal arrives at celestial fields."

Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha's
presence:

> "Good, sir, is giving!\
> Even when one has little, giving is good.\
> And it's also good to give out of faith.\
> And it's also good to give legitimate wealth.\
> And it's also good to give intelligently.
>
> The Holy One praises giving intelligently\
> to those worthy of offerings here\
> － in the world of the living.\
> What's given to these is very fruitful,\
> like seeds sown in a fertile field."

Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha's
presence:

> "Good, sir, is giving!\
> Even when one has little, giving is good.\
> And it's also good to give out of faith.\
> And it's also good to give legitimate wealth.\
> And it's also good to give intelligently.\
> And it's also good to be restrained\
> － when it comes to living creatures.
>
> One who lives without harming any living being\
> never does bad because of others' blame;\
> for in that case they praise the coward, not the brave;\
> and the virtuous never do bad out of fear."

Then another deity said to the Buddha, "Sir, who has spoken well?"

"You've all spoken well in your own way. However, listen to me also:

> It's true that giving is praised in many ways\

> for in days old and older still,\
> the wise and virtuous even attained extinction."

### N 1.34 There Are None *Nasantisutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Monastery.

Then, late at night, several glorious deities of the Satullapa Group,
lighting up the entire Jeta's Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and
stood to one side. Standing to one side, one deity recited this verse in
the Buddha's presence:

> "Among humans there are no sensual pleasures\
> － that are permanent.\
> Here there are sensuous things, bound to which,\
> drunk on which, there's no coming back.\
> That person doesn't return from Death's dominion."
>
> "Misery is born of desire; suffering is born of desire;\
> when desire is removed, misery is removed;\
> when misery is removed, suffering is removed."
>
> "The world's pretty things aren't sensual pleasures.\
> Greedy intention is a person's sensual pleasure.\
> The world's pretty things stay just as they are,\
> but the attentive remove desire for them.
>
> Give up anger, get rid of conceit,\
> and get past all the fetters.\
> Sufferings don't torment the one who has nothing,\
> not clinging to name and form.
>
> Assessment was given up, conceit rejected;\
> craving for name and form was cut off right here.\
> They cut the ties, untroubled,\
> － with no need for hope.\
> Though gods and humans search for them\
> in this world and the world beyond,\
> － they never find them,\
> not in heaven nor in any abode."
>
> "If neither gods nor humans see one freed in this way,"\
> *said Venerable Mogharājā,*\
> "in this world or the world beyond,\
> are those who revere that supreme person,\
> who lives for the good of mankind,\
> － also worthy of praise?"
>
> "The mendicants who revere one freed in this way,"\
> *said the Buddha,*\
> "are also worthy of praise, Mogharājā.\
> Having understood the teaching\
> － and given up doubt,\
> those mendicants can slip their chains."

### N 1.35 Disdain *Ujjhānasaññisutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Monastery.

Then, late at night, several glorious deities of the Disdainful Group,
lighting up the entire Jeta's Grove, went up to the Buddha, and stood in
the air. Standing in the air, one deity recited this verse in the
Buddha's presence:

> "Someone who pretends\
> to be other than they really are,\
> is like a cheating gambler\
> who enjoys what was gained by theft.
>
> You should only say what you would do;\
> you shouldn't say what you wouldn't do.\
> The wise will recognize\
> one who talks without doing."
>
> "Not just by speaking,\
> nor solely by listening,\
> are you able to progress\
> on this hard path,\
> by which the attentive practicing absorption\
> are released from Māra's bonds.
>
> The attentive certainly don't act like that,\
> for they understand the way of the world.\
> The attentive are quenched by understanding,\
> they've crossed over clinging to the world."

Then those deities landed on the ground, bowed with their heads at the
Buddha's feet and said, "We have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish,
stupid, and unskillful of us to imagine we could attack the Buddha!
Please, sir, accept our mistake for what it is, so we will restrain
ourselves in future."

At that, the Buddha smiled.

Then those deities, becoming even more disdainful, flew up in the air.
One deity recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "If you don't give your pardon\
> when a mistake is confessed,\
> with hidden anger and heavy hate,\
> you're stuck in your enmity."
>
> "If no mistake is found,\
> if no-one's gone astray,\
> and enmities are settled,\
> then who could have been unskillful?"
>
> "Who makes no mistakes?\
> Who doesn't go astray?\
> Who doesn't fall into confusion?\
> Who is attentive, ever mindful?"
>
> "The Realized One, the Buddha,\
> sympathetic for all beings:\
> that's who makes no mistakes,\
> and that's who doesn't go astray.\
> He doesn't fall into confusion,\
> for he's attentive, ever mindful.
>
> If you don't give your pardon\
> when a mistake is confessed,\
> with hidden anger and heavy hate,\
> you're stuck in your enmity.\
> I don't approve of such enmity,\
> and so I pardon your mistake."

### N 1.36 Faith *Saddhāsutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

Then, late at night, several glorious deities of the Satullapa Group,
lighting up the entire Jeta's Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and
stood to one side. Standing to one side, one deity recited this verse in
the Buddha's presence:

> "Faith is a person's partner.\
> If faithlessness doesn't linger,\
> fame and renown are theirs,\
> and when they discard this corpse they go to heaven."

Then another deity recited these verses in the Buddha's presence:

> "Give up anger, get rid of conceit,\
> and get past all the fetters.\
> Chains don't torment one who has nothing,\
> not clinging to name and form."
>
> "Fools and simpletons\
> devote themselves to negligence.\
> But the wise protect diligence\
> as their best treasure.
>
> Don't devote yourself to negligence,\
> or delight in erotic intimacy.\
> For if you're diligent and practice absorption,\

### N 1.37 The Congregation *Samayasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in the
land of the Sakyans, in the Great Wood near Kapilavatthu, together with
a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants, all of whom were
perfected ones. And most of the deities from ten solar systems had
gathered to see the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants.

Then four deities of the Pure Abodes, aware of what was happening,
thought: "Why don't we go to the Buddha and each recite a verse in his
presence?"

Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm,
they vanished from the Pure Abodes and reappeared in front of the
Buddha. They bowed to the Buddha and stood to one side. Standing to one
side, one deity recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "There's a great congregation in the woods,\
> where hosts of gods have assembled.\
> We've come to this righteous congregation\
> to see the invincible Saṅgha!"

Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "The mendicants there have immersion,\
> they've straightened their own minds.\
> Like a charioteer holding the reins,\
> the astute ones protect their senses."

Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "They snapped the post and snapped the cross-bar,\
> unstirred, they tore out the boundary post.\
> They live pure and immaculate,\
> the young giants tamed by the Clear-eyed One."

Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "Anyone who has gone to the Buddha for refuge\
> won't go to a plane of loss.\
> After giving up this human body,\
> they swell the hosts of gods."

<!--pg-->
### N 1.38 A Splinter *Sakalikasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha in the Maddakucchi deer park.

Now at that time the Buddha's foot had been cut by a splinter. The
Buddha was stricken by harrowing pains; physical feelings that were
painful, sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, and disagreeable. But he
endured unbothered, with mindfulness and situational awareness. And then
he spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion's
posture---on the right side, placing one foot on top of the
other---mindful and aware.

Then, late at night, seven hundred glorious deities of the Satullapa
Group, lighting up the entire Maddakucchi, went up to the Buddha, bowed,
and stood to one side.

Standing to one side, one deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in
the Buddha's presence: "The ascetic Gotama is such an elephant, sir! And
as an elephant, he endures painful physical feelings that have come
up---sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, and disagreeable---unbothered,
with mindfulness and situational awareness."

Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha's
presence: "The ascetic Gotama is such a lion, sir! And as a lion, he
endures painful physical feelings ... unbothered."

Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha's
presence: "The ascetic Gotama is such a thoroughbred, sir! And as a
thoroughbred, he endures painful physical feelings ... unbothered."

Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha's
presence: "The ascetic Gotama is such a chief bull, sir! And as a chief
bull, he endures painful physical feelings ... unbothered."

Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha's
presence: "The ascetic Gotama is such a behemoth, sir! And as a
behemoth, he endures painful physical feelings ... unbothered."

Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha's
presence: "The ascetic Gotama is truly tamed, sir! And as someone tamed,
he endures painful physical feelings ... unbothered."

Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha's
presence: "See, his immersion is so well developed, and his mind is so
well freed---not leaning forward or pulling back, and not held in place
by forceful suppression. If anyone imagines that they can overcome such
an elephant of a man, a lion of a man, a thoroughbred of a man, a chief
bull of a man, a behemoth of a man, a tamed man---what is that but a
failure to see?"

> "Learned in the five Vedas, brahmins practice\
> mortification for a full century.\
> But their minds are not properly freed,\
> for those of base character don't cross to the far shore.
>
> Seized by craving,\
> － attached to precepts and observances,\
> they practice rough and fervent mortification for a hundred years.\
> But their minds are not properly freed,\
> for those of base character don't cross to the far shore.
>
> Someone who's fond of conceit can't be tamed,\
> and someone without immersion can't be a sage.\
> Living negligent alone in the wilderness,\
> they can't pass beyond Death's dominion."
>
> "Having given up conceit, serene within oneself,\
> with a good heart, everywhere free;\
> living diligent alone in the wilderness,\
> they pass beyond Death's dominion."

### N 1.39 With Pajjunna's Daughter (1st) *Paṭhamapajjunnadhītusutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked
roof.

Then, late at night, the beautiful Kokanadā, Pajjunna's
daughter, lighting up the entire Great Wood, went up to the Buddha,
bowed, stood to one side, and recited these verses in the Buddha's
presence:

> "Staying in the woods of Vesālī\

> Kokanadā am I who worships him,\
> Kokanadā, Pajjuna's daughter.
>
> Previously I had only heard\

>
> The teaching is such that\

>
> You should never do anything bad\

these verses in the Buddha's presence:

>
> And as the world is on fire\
