### N 39.1--15 With Sāmaṇḍaka on Extinguishment *Sāmaṇḍakasutta*

At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying in the land of
the Vajjis near Ukkacelā on the bank of the Ganges river.
Then the wanderer Sāmaṇḍaka went up to Venerable
Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When the
greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and
said to Sāriputta:

"Reverend Sāriputta, they speak of this thing called
'extinguishment'. What is extinguishment?"

"Reverend, the ending of greed, hate, and delusion is called
extinguishment."

"But, reverend, is there a path and a practice for realizing this
extinguishment?"

"There is, reverend."

"Well, what is it?"

"It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right
thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort,
right mindfulness, and right immersion. This is the path, the practice,
for realizing this extinguishment."

"Reverend, this is a fine path, a fine practice, for realizing this
extinguishment. Just this much is enough to be diligent."

### N 39.16 Hard to Do *Dukkarasutta*

"Reverend Sāriputta, in this teaching and training, what is
hard to do?"

"Going forth, reverend, is hard to do in this teaching and training."

"But what's hard to do for someone who has gone forth?"

"When you've gone forth it's hard to be satisfied."

"But what's hard to do for someone who is satisfied?"

"When you're satisfied, it's hard to practice in line with the
teaching."

"But if a mendicant practices in line with the teaching, will it take
them long to become a perfected one?"

"Not long, reverend."
