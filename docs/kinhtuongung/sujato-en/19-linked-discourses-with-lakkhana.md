## Chapter One

### N 19.1 A Skeleton *Aṭṭhisutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding
ground.

Now at that time Venerable Lakkhaṇa and Venerable
Mahāmoggallāna were staying on the Vulture's Peak Mountain.
Then Mahāmoggallāna robed up in the morning and, taking his
bowl and robe, went to Lakkhaṇa and said to him, "Come,
Reverend Lakkhaṇa, let's enter Rājagaha for
alms."

"Yes, reverend," Lakkhaṇa replied.

As Mahāmoggallāna was descending from Vulture's Peak
Mountain he smiled at a certain spot. So Lakkhaṇa said to
Mahāmoggallāna, "What is the cause, Reverend
Moggallāna, what is the reason you smiled?"

"Reverend Lakkhaṇa, it's the wrong time for this question.
Ask me when we're in the Buddha's presence."

Then Lakkhaṇa and Mahāmoggallāna wandered for
alms in Rājagaha. After the meal, on their return from
almsround, they went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
Lakkhaṇa said to Mahāmoggallāna:

"Just now, as Mahāmoggallāna was descending from Vulture's
Peak Mountain he smiled at a certain spot. What is the cause, Reverend
Moggallāna, what is the reason you smiled?"

"Just now, reverend, as I was descending from Vulture's Peak Mountain I
saw a skeleton flying through the air. Vultures, crows, and hawks kept
chasing it, pecking, clawing, and stabbing it in the ribs as it
screeched in pain. It occurred to me: 'Oh lord, how incredible, how
amazing! That there can be such a sentient being, such an entity, such
an incarnation!'"

Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:

"Mendicants, there are disciples who live full of vision and knowledge,
since a disciple knows, sees, and witnesses such a thing.

Formerly, I too saw that being, but I did not speak of it. For if I had
spoken of it others would not have believed me, which would be for their
lasting harm and suffering.

That being used to be a cattle butcher right here in
Rājagaha. As a result of that deed he burned in hell for
many years, many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of
years. Now he experiences the residual result of that deed in such an
incarnation."
