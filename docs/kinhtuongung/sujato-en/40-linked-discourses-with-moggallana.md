### SN 40.1 A Question About the First Absorption *Paṭhamajhānapañhāsutta*

At one time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. There Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the
mendicants: "Reverends, mendicants!"

"Reverend," they replied. Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said
this:

"Just now, reverends, as I was in private retreat this thought came to
mind: 'They speak of this thing called the "first absorption". What is
the first absorption?' It occurred to me: 'It's when a mendicant, quite
secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities,
enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and
bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it
connected. This is called the first absorption.'

And so ... I was entering and remaining in the first absorption. While I
was in that meditation, perception and focus accompanied by sensual
pleasures beset me.

Then the Buddha came up to me with his psychic power and said,
'Moggallāna, Moggallāna! Don't neglect the
first absorption, brahmin! Settle your mind in the first absorption;
unify your mind and immerse it in the first absorption.'

And so, after some time ... I entered and remained in the first
absorption.

So if anyone should be rightly called a disciple who attained to great
direct knowledge with help from the Teacher, it's me."

### SN 40.2 A Question About the Second Absorption *Dutiyajhānapañhāsutta*

"They speak of this thing called the 'second absorption'. What is the
second absorption? It occurred to me: 'As the placing of the mind and
keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the
second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion,
with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and
keeping it connected. This is called the second absorption.'

And so ... I was entering and remaining in the second absorption. While
I was in that meditation, perception and focus accompanied by placing
the mind beset me.

Then the Buddha came up to me with his psychic power and said,
'Moggallāna, Moggallāna! Don't neglect the
second absorption, brahmin! Settle your mind in the second absorption;
unify your mind and immerse it in the second absorption.'

And so, after some time ... I entered and remained in the second
absorption.

So if anyone should be rightly called a disciple who attained to great
direct knowledge with help from the Teacher, it's me."

### SN 40.3 A Question About the Third Absorption *Tatiyajhānapañhāsutta*

"They speak of this thing called the 'third absorption'. What is the
third absorption? It occurred to me: 'With the fading away of rapture, a
mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they
meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the
bliss of which the noble ones declare, "Equanimous and mindful, one
meditates in bliss." This is called the third absorption.'

And so ... I was entering and remaining in the third absorption. While I
was in that meditation, perception and focus accompanied by rapture
beset me.

Then the Buddha came up to me with his psychic power and said,
'Moggallāna, Moggallāna! Don't neglect the
third absorption, brahmin! Settle your mind in the third absorption;
unify your mind and immerse it in the third absorption.'

And so, after some time ... I entered and remained in the third
absorption. So if anyone should be rightly called a disciple who
attained to great direct knowledge with help from the Teacher, it's me."

### SN 40.4 A Question About the Fourth Absorption *Catutthajhānapañhāsutta*

"They speak of this thing called the 'fourth absorption'. What is the
fourth absorption? It occurred to me: 'It's when, giving up pleasure and
pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and
remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure
equanimity and mindfulness. This is called the fourth absorption.'

And so ... I was entering and remaining in the fourth absorption. While
I was in that meditation, perception and focus accompanied by pleasure
beset me.

Then the Buddha came up to me with his psychic power and said,
'Moggallāna, Moggallāna! Don't neglect the
fourth absorption, brahmin! Settle your mind in the fourth absorption;
unify your mind and immerse it in the fourth absorption.'

And so, after some time ... I entered and remained in the fourth
absorption.

is the dimension of infinite space? It occurred to me: 'It's when a

diversity---aware that "space is infinite", enters and remains in the
dimension of infinite space. This is called the dimension of infinite
space.'

And so ... I was entering and remaining in the dimension of infinite

### SN 40.10 With Sakka *Sakkasutta*

And then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, as easily as a strong
person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from Jeta's Grove
and reappeared among the gods of the thirty-three. Then Sakka, lord of
gods, with five hundred deities came up to Mahāmoggallāna,
bowed, and stood to one side. Mahāmoggallāna said to him:

"Lord of gods, it's good to go for refuge to the Buddha. It's the reason
why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are
reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. It's good to go for refuge to
the teaching. It's the reason why some sentient beings, when their body
breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
It's good to go for refuge to the Saṅgha. It's the reason
why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are
reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm."

"My good Moggallāna, it's good to go for refuge to the
Buddha ... the teaching ... the Saṅgha. It's the reason why
some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn
in a good place, a heavenly realm."

Then Sakka, lord of gods, with five hundred deities came up to
Mahāmoggallāna, bowed, and stood to one side.
Mahāmoggallāna said to him:

"Lord of gods, it's good to have experiential confidence in the Buddha:
'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in
knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for
those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.'
It's the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up,
after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.

It's good to have experiential confidence in the teaching: 'The teaching
is well explained by the Buddha---apparent in the present life,
immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible
people can know it for themselves.' It's the reason why some sentient
beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good
place, a heavenly realm.

It's good to have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha:
'The Saṅgha of the Buddha's disciples is practicing the way
that's good, sincere, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four
pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the
Buddha's disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods,
worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of
greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the
world.' It's the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks
up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.

It's good to have the ethical conduct that's loved by the noble ones,
unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by
sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. It's the reason
why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are
reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm."

"My good Moggallāna, it's good to have experiential
confidence in the Buddha ... the teaching ... the Saṅgha
... and to have the ethical conduct that's loved by the noble ones ...

after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm."

Mahāmoggallāna said to him:

"Lord of gods, it's good to go for refuge to the Buddha. It's the reason
why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are
reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. They surpass other gods in ten
respects: heavenly lifespan, beauty, happiness, glory, sovereignty,
sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches.

It's good to go for refuge to the teaching ...
