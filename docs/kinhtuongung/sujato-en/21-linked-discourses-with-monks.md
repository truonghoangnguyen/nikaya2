## The Chapter on Monks

### SN 21.1 With Kolita *Kolitasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. There Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the
mendicants: "Reverends, mendicants!"

"Reverend," they replied.

Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this:

"Just now, reverends, as I was in private retreat this thought came to
mind: 'They speak of this thing called "noble silence". What then is
this noble silence?'

It occurred to me: 'As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected
are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption,
which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity
and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. This
is called noble silence.'

And so, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were
stilled, I was entering and remaining in the second absorption, which
has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and
mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.

While I was in that meditation, perception and focus accompanied by
placing the mind beset me.

Then the Buddha came up to me with his psychic power and said,
'Moggallāna, Moggallāna! Don't neglect noble
silence, brahmin! Settle your mind in noble silence; unify your mind and
bring it to immersion in noble silence.'

And so, after some time, as the placing of the mind and keeping it
connected were stilled, I entered and remained in the second absorption
...

So if anyone should be rightly called a disciple who attained to great
direct knowledge with help from the Teacher, it's me."

### SN 21.2 With Upatissa *Upatissasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants: "Reverends,
mendicants!"

"Reverend," they replied. Sāriputta said this:

"Just now, reverends, as I was in private retreat this thought came to
mind: 'Is there anything in the world whose decay and perishing would
give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in me?' It
occurred to me: 'There is nothing in the world whose decay and perishing
would give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in
me.'"

When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to him, "Even if the Teacher
were to decay and perish? Wouldn't that give rise to sorrow,
lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in you?"

"Even if the Teacher were to decay and perish, that wouldn't give rise
to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in me. Still, I
would think: 'Alas, the illustrious Teacher, so mighty and powerful, has
vanished! If the Buddha was to remain for a long time, that would be for
the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world,
for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.'"

"That must be because Venerable Sāriputta has long ago
totally eradicated I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendency to
conceit. So even if the Teacher were to decay and perish, it wouldn't
give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in him."

### SN 21.3 A Mound of Salt *Ghaṭasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery.

At that time Venerables Sāriputta and
Moggallāna were staying near Rājagaha, in the
Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding ground. Then in the late afternoon,
Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable
Moggallāna, and exchanged greetings with him. When the
greetings and polite conversation were over, Sāriputta sat
down to one side, and said to Mahāmoggallāna:

"Reverend Moggallāna, your faculties are so very clear, and
your complexion is pure and bright. Have you spent the day in a peaceful
meditation?"

"Reverend, I've spent the day in a coarse meditation. But I have had
some Dhamma talk."

"Who did you have a Dhamma talk with?"

"With the Buddha."

"But Reverend, the Buddha is far away. He's staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. Did you go to him with your psychic power, or did he come to
you?"

"No reverend, I didn't go to him with my psychic power, nor did he come
to me. Rather, the Buddha cleared his clairvoyance and clairaudience
towards me, and I cleared my clairvoyance and clairaudience towards
him."

"But what manner of Dhamma talk did you have together?"

"Well, reverend, I said to the Buddha, 'Sir, they speak of one who is
energetic. How is an energetic person defined?'

When I said this, the Buddha said, 'Moggallāna, it's when a
mendicant lives with energy roused up: "Gladly, let only skin, sinews,
and bones remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body! I will
not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human
strength, energy, and vigor." That's how a person is energetic.'

That's the Dhamma talk I had together with the Buddha."

"Reverend, next to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna I'm like a few
pieces of gravel next to the Himalayas, the king of mountains. Venerable
Mahāmoggallāna is so mighty and powerful he could, if he
wished, live on for the proper lifespan."

"Reverend, next to Venerable Sāriputta I'm like a few
grains of salt next to a mound of salt. Venerable Sāriputta
has been commended, complimented, and praised by the Buddha:

> 'Sāriputta is full of wisdom,\
> ethics, and peace.\
> Even a mendicant who has crossed over\
> might at best equal him.'"

And so these two spiritual giants agreed with each others' fine words.

### SN 21.4 A Junior Mendicant *Navasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time a certain junior monk, after his meal, on his return
from almsround, entered his dwelling, where he adhered to passivity and
silence. And he didn't help the mendicants out when it was time to sew
robes. Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to
one side, and told him what had happened.

So the Buddha addressed one of the monks, "Please, monk, in my name tell
that monk that the Teacher summons him."

"Yes, sir," that monk replied. He went to that monk and said to him,
"Reverend, the teacher summons you."

"Yes, reverend," that monk replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and
sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:

"Is it really true, monk, that after your meal, on your return from
almsround, you entered your dwelling, where you adhered to passivity and
silence, and you didn't help the mendicants out when it was time to sew
robes?"

"Sir, I am doing my own work."

Then the Buddha, knowing that monk's train of thought, addressed the
mendicants: "Mendicants, don't complain about this monk. This monk gets
the four absorptions---blissful meditations in this life that belong to
the higher mind---when he wants, without trouble or difficulty. He has
realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very
life, and lives having achieved with his own insight the goal for which
gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "Not by being slack,\
> or with little strength\
> is extinguishment realized,\
> the freedom from all suffering.
>
> This young monk,\
> this best of men,\
> bears his final body,\
> having vanquished Māra and his mount."

### SN 21.5 With Sujāta *Sujātasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then Venerable Sujāta went to see the Buddha.

The Buddha saw him coming off in the distance, and addressed the
mendicants: "This gentleman is beautiful in both ways. He's attractive,
good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. And he has realized the
supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lives having
achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go
forth from the lay life to homelessness."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "This mendicant is truly beautiful.\
> His heart is sincere,\
> he's unfettered, detached,\
> quenched by not grasping.\
> He bears his final body,\
> having vanquished Māra and his mount."

<!--pg-->
### SN 21.6 With Bhaddiya the Dwarf *Lakuṇḍakabhaddiyasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then Venerable Bhaddiya the Dwarf went to see the Buddha.

The Buddha saw him coming off in the distance, and addressed the
mendicants: "Mendicants, do you see this monk coming---ugly, unsightly,
deformed, and despised by the mendicants?"

"Yes, sir."

"That mendicant is very mighty and powerful. It's not easy to find an
attainment that he has not already attained. And he has realized the
supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lives having
achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go
forth from the lay life to homelessness."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "Geese, herons, and peacocks,\
> elephants and spotted deer---\
> though their bodies are not equal,\
> they all fear the lion.
>
> So it is for humans---\
> if a little person is wise,\
> they're the truly great one,\
> not the fool with a good body."

### SN 21.7 With Visākha, Pañcāli's Son *Visākhasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked
roof.

Now at that time Venerable Visākha, Pañcāli's
son, was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants
in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk. His words were polished, clear,
articulate, expressing the meaning, comprehensive, and independent.

Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to
the assembly hall. He sat down on the seat spread out, and addressed the
mendicants: "Mendicants, who was educating, encouraging, firing up, and
inspiring the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk?"

"Sir, it was Venerable Visākha, Pañcāli's
son."

Then the Buddha said to Visākha:

"Good, good, Visākha! It's good that you educate,
encourage, fire up, and inspire the mendicants in the assembly hall with
a Dhamma talk, with words that are polished, clear, articulate,
expressing the meaning, comprehensive, and independent."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "Though an astute person is mixed up with fools,\
> they don't know unless he speaks.\
> But when he speaks they know,\
> he's teaching the state free of death.
>
> He should speak and illustrate the teaching,\
> holding up the banner of the seers.\
> Words well spoken are the seers' banner,\
> for the teaching is the banner of the seers."

<!--pg-->
### SN 21.8 With Nanda *Nandasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then Venerable Nanda---the Buddha's cousin on his mother's
side---dressed in nicely pressed and ironed robes, applied eyeshadow,
and took a polished black bowl. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat
down to one side. The Buddha said to him:

"Nanda, as a gentleman who has gone forth out of faith from the lay life
to homelessness, it's not appropriate for you to dress in nicely pressed
and ironed robes, apply eyeshadow, and carry a polished black bowl. It's
appropriate for you to stay in the wilderness, eat only almsfood, wear
rag robes, and live without concern for sensual pleasures."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "When will I see Nanda\
> in the wilderness, wearing rag robes,\
> feeding on scraps offered by strangers,\
> unconcerned for sensual pleasures?"

Then some time later Venerable Nanda stayed in the wilderness, ate only
almsfood, wore rag robes, and lived without concern for sensual
pleasures.

<!--pg-->
### SN 21.9 With Tissa *Tissasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then Venerable Tissa---the Buddha's cousin on his father's side---went
to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. He was miserable and
sad, with tears flowing. Then the Buddha said to him:

"Tissa, why are you sitting there so miserable and sad, with tears
flowing?"

"Sir, it's because the mendicants beset me on all sides with sneering
and jeering."

"That's because you admonish others, but don't accept admonition
yourself. As a gentleman who has gone forth out of faith from the lay
life to homelessness, it's not appropriate for you to admonish others
without accepting admonition yourself. It's appropriate for you to
admonish others and accept admonition yourself."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "Why are you angry? Don't be angry!\
> It's better to not be angry, Tissa.\
> For this spiritual life is lived\
> in order to remove anger, conceit, and denigration."

### SN 21.10 A Mendicant Named Senior *Theranāmakasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the
Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding ground.

Now at that time there was a certain mendicant named Senior. He lived
alone and praised living alone. He entered the village for alms alone,
returned alone, sat in private alone, and focussed on walking mindfully
alone.

Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to him, "Sir, there's a certain mendicant named Senior
who lives alone and praises living alone."

So the Buddha addressed one of the monks, "Please, monk, in my name tell
the mendicant Senior that the teacher summons him."

"Yes, sir," that monk replied. He went to Venerable Senior and said to
him, "Reverend Senior, the teacher summons you."

"Yes, reverend," that monk replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and
sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:

"Is it really true, Senior, that you live alone and praise living
alone?"

"Yes, sir."

"But in what way do you live alone and praise living alone?"

"Well, sir, I enter the village for alms alone, return alone, sit in
private alone, and focus on walking mindfully alone. That's how I live
alone and praise living alone."

"That is a kind of living alone, I don't deny it. But as to how living
alone is fulfilled in detail, listen and apply your mind well, I will
speak."

"Yes, sir," he replied.

"And how, Senior, is living alone fulfilled in detail? It's when what's
in the past is given up, what's in the future is relinquished, and
desire and greed for present incarnations is eliminated. That's how
living alone is fulfilled in detail."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "The champion, all-knower, so very intelligent,\
> is unsullied in the midst of all things.\
> He's given up all, freed in the ending of craving:\
> I declare that man to be one who lives alone."

### SN 21.11 With Mahākappina *Mahākappinasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then Venerable Mahākappina went to see the Buddha.

The Buddha saw him coming off in the distance, and addressed the
mendicants: "Mendicants, do you see that monk coming---white, thin, with
a pointy nose?"

"Yes, sir."

"That mendicant is very mighty and powerful. It's not easy to find an
attainment that he has not already attained. And he has realized the
supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lives having
achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go
forth from the lay life to homelessness."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "The aristocrat is best among people\
> who take clan as the standard.\
> But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct\
> is best among gods and humans.
>
> The sun blazes by day,\
> the moon glows at night,\
> the aristocrat shines in armor,\
> and the brahmin shines in absorption.\
> But all day and all night,\
> the Buddha shines with glory."

<!--pg-->
### SN 21.12 Companions *Sahāyakasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then two mendicants who were companions, protégés of Venerable
Mahākappina, went to see the Buddha.

The Buddha saw them coming off in the distance, and addressed the
mendicants: "Mendicants, do you see those monks coming who are
companions, protégés of Venerable Mahākappina?"

"Yes, sir."

"Those mendicants are very mighty and powerful. It's not easy to find an
attainment that they have not already attained. And they've realized the
supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. They live having
achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go
forth from the lay life to homelessness."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "These companion mendicants\
> have been together for a long time.\
> The true teaching has brought them together,\
> the teaching proclaimed by the Buddha.
>
> They've been well trained by Kappina\
> in the teaching proclaimed by the Noble One.\
> They bear their final body,\
> having vanquished Māra and his mount."
