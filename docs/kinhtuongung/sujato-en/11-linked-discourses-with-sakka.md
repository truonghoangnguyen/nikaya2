## Chapter One

### N 11.1 With Suvīra *Suvīrasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Once upon a time, mendicants, the titans marched against the gods.

Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the god Suvīra, 'Dear
Suvīra, the titans march against the gods! Go, and march
against the titans!'

'Yes, lord,' replied Suvīra. But he fell into negligence.

For a second time Sakka addressed Suvīra, 'Dear
Suvīra, the titans march against the gods! Go, and march
against the titans!'

'Yes, lord,' replied Suvīra. But for a second time he fell
into negligence.

For a third time Sakka addressed Suvīra, 'Dear
Suvīra, the titans march against the gods! Go, and march
against the titans!'

'Yes, lord,' replied Suvīra. But for a third time he fell
into negligence.

Then Sakka addressed the god Suvīra in verse:

> 'Suvīra, go to that place\
> where you can achieve happiness\
> without working for it or trying hard---\
> and take me with you!'
>
> 'That a lazy man who does no work,\
> and doesn't do his duty,\
> should fulfill all his desires:\
> Sakka, grant me this boon!'
>
> 'Suvīra, go to that place\
> where a lazy man who does no work\
> prospers in unending happiness---\
> and take me with you!'
>
> 'O Sakka, first among gods,\
> that we might find the happiness\
> that's sorrowless, unstressed:\
> Sakka, grant me this boon!'
>
> 'If there exists anywhere a place\
> where one can live happily without working,\
> that surely would be extinguishment's path!\
> Go there, Suvīra,\
> and take me with you!'

So, mendicants, even Sakka, lord of gods---while living off of the fruit
of his good and bad deeds, and ruling as sovereign lord over these gods
of the thirty-three---will speak in praise of initiative and energy. But
since you have gone forth in such a well explained teaching and
training, it would be truly beautiful for you to try hard, strive, and
make an effort to attain the unattained, achieve the unachieved, and
realize the unrealized!"

### N 11.2 With Susīma *Susīmasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Once upon a time, mendicants, the titans marched against the gods.

Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the god Susīma, 'Dear
Susīma, the titans march against the gods! Go, and march
against the titans!'

'Yes, lord,' replied Susīma. But he fell into negligence.

For a second time ...

For a third time ...

Then Sakka addressed the god Susīma in verse:

> 'Susīma, go to that place\
> where you can achieve happiness\
> without working for it or trying hard---\
> and take me with you!'
>
> 'That a lazy man who does no work,\
> and doesn't do his duty,\
> should fulfill all his desires:\
> Sakka, grant me this boon!'
>
> 'Susīma, go to that place\
> where a lazy man who does no work\
> prospers in unending happiness---\
> and take me with you!'
>
> 'O Sakka, first among gods,\
> that we might find the happiness\
> that's sorrowless, unstressed:\
> Sakka, grant me this boon!'
>
> 'If there exists anywhere a place\
> where one can live happily without working,\
> that surely would be extinguishment's path!\
> Susīma, go to that place\
> and take me with you!'

So, mendicants, even Sakka, lord of gods---while living off of the fruit
of his good and bad deeds, and ruling as sovereign lord over these gods
of the thirty-three---will speak in praise of initiative and energy. But
since you have gone forth in such a well explained teaching and
training, it would be truly beautiful for you to try hard, strive, and
make an effort to attain the unattained, achieve the unachieved, and
realize the unrealized!"

### N 11.3 The Banner's Crest *Dhajaggasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Once upon a time, mendicants, a battle was fought between the gods and
the titans. Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the
thirty-three:

'Good fellows, when the gods are fighting, if you get scared or
terrified, just look up at my banner's crest. Then your fear and terror
will go away.

If you can't see my banner's crest, then look up at the banner's crest
of the Progenitor, king of gods. Then your fear and terror will go away.

If you can't see his banner's crest, then look up at the banner's crest
of Varuṇa, king of gods. Then your fear and terror will go
away.

If you can't see his banner's crest, then look up at the banner's crest
of Īsāna, king of gods. Then your fear and terror will go
away.'

However, when they look up at those banner's crests their fear and
terror might go away or it might not.

Why is that? Because Sakka is not free of greed, hate, and delusion. He
is fearful, scared, nervous, quick to flee.

But, mendicants, I say this: If you've gone to a wilderness, or to the
root of a tree, or to an empty hut and you get scared or terrified, just
recollect me: 'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha,
accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world,
supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans,
awakened, blessed.' Then your fear and terror will go away.

If you can't recollect me, then recollect the teaching: 'The teaching is
well explained by the Buddha---apparent in the present life, immediately
effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can
know it for themselves.' Then your fear and terror will go away.

If you can't recollect the teaching, then recollect the
Saṅgha: 'The Saṅgha of the Buddha's disciples
is practicing the way that's good, sincere, systematic, and proper. It
consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the
Saṅgha of the Buddha's disciples that is worthy of
offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a
religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the
supreme field of merit for the world.' Then your fear and terror will go
away.

Why is that? Because the Realized One is free of greed, hate, and
delusion. He is fearless, brave, bold, and stands his ground."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "In the wilderness, at a tree's root,\
> or an empty hut, O mendicants,\
> recollect the Buddha,\
> and no fear will come to you.
>
> If you can't recollect the Buddha---\
> the eldest in the world, the chief of men---\
> then recollect the teaching,\
> emancipating, well taught.
>
> If you can't recollect the teaching---\
> emancipating, well taught---\
> then recollect the Saṅgha,\
> the supreme field of merit.
>
> Thus recollecting the Buddha,\
> the teaching, and the Saṅgha, mendicants,\
> fear and terror\
> and goosebumps will be no more."

### N 11.4 With Vepacitti *Vepacittisutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Once upon a time, mendicants, a battle was fought between the gods and
the titans.

Then Vepacitti, lord of titans, addressed the titans, 'My good fellows,
if the titans defeat the gods in this battle, bind Sakka, the lord of
gods, by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the citadel
of the titans.'

Meanwhile, Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the thirty-three,
'My good fellows, if the gods defeat the titans in this battle, bind
Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the Hall
of Justice of the gods.'

In that battle the gods won and the titans lost. So the gods of the
thirty-three bound Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and brought him to
Sakka's presence in the Hall of Justice of the gods.

And as Sakka was entering and leaving the hall, Vepacitti abused and
insulted him with rude, harsh words. So Mātali the
charioteer addressed Sakka in verse,

> 'O Maghavā, O Sakka,\
> is it from fear or from weakness\
> that you put up with such harsh words\
> in the presence of Vepacitti?'
>
> 'It's not out of fear or weakness\
> that I'm patient with Vepacitti.\
> For how can a sensible person like me\
> get in a fight with a fool?'
>
> 'Fools would vent even more\
> if there's no-one to put a stop to them.\
> So a wise one should stop\
> a fool with forceful punishment.'
>
> 'I think that this is the only way\
> to put a stop to a fool,\
> when you know that the other is upset,\
> be mindful and stay calm.'
>
> 'I see this fault, Vāsava,\
> in just being patient.\
> When a fool thinks,\
> "He puts up with me out of fear,"\
> the simpleton will go after you even harder,\
> like a cow chasing someone who runs away.'
>
> 'Let him think this if he wishes, or not---\
> "He puts up with me out of fear."\
> Of goals culminating in one's own good,\
> none better than patience is found.
>
> When a strong person\
> puts up with a weakling,\
> they call that the ultimate patience,\
> for a weakling must always be patient.
>
> The strength of folly\
> is really just weakness, they say.\
> But no-one can challenge a person\
> who's strong, guarded by the teaching.
>
> When you get angry at an angry person\
> you just make things worse for yourself.\
> When you don't get angry at an angry person\
> you win a battle hard to win.
>
> When you know that the other is angry,\
> you act for the good of both\
> yourself and the other\
> if you're mindful and stay calm.
>
> People unfamiliar with the teaching\
> consider one who heals both\
> oneself and the other\
> to be a fool.'

So, mendicants, even Sakka, lord of gods---while living off of the fruit
of his good and bad deeds, and ruling as sovereign lord over these gods
of the thirty-three---will speak in praise of patience and sweetness.
But since you have gone forth in such a well explained teaching and
training, it would be truly beautiful for you to be patient and gentle!"

<!--pg-->
### N 11.5 Victory by Good Speech *Subhāsitajayasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Once upon a time, mendicants, a battle was fought between the gods and
the titans.

Then Vepacitti, lord of titans, said to Sakka, lord of gods, 'Lord of
gods, let there be victory by fine words!'

'Vepacitti, let there be victory by fine words!'

Then the gods and the titans appointed a panel of judges, saying, 'These
will understand our good and bad statements.'

Then Vepacitti, lord of titans, said to Sakka, lord of gods, 'Lord of
gods, recite a verse!'

When he said this, Sakka said to him, 'Vepacitti, you are the elder god
here. Recite a verse.'

So Vepacitti recited this verse:

> 'Fools would vent even more\
> if there's no-one to put a stop to them.\
> So an intelligent person should stop\
> a fool with forceful punishment.'

The titans applauded Vepacitti's verse, while the gods kept silent.

Then Vepacitti said to Sakka, 'Lord of gods, recite a verse!' So Sakka
recited this verse:

> 'I think that this is the only way\
> to put a stop to a fool,\
> when you know that the other is upset,\
> be mindful and stay calm.'

The gods applauded Sakka's verse, while the titans kept silent.

Then Sakka said to Vepacitti, 'Vepacitti, recite a verse!' So Vepacitti
recited this verse:

> 'I see this fault, Vāsava,\
> in just being patient.\
> When a fool thinks,\
> "He puts up with me out of fear,"\
> the simpleton will go after you even harder,\
> like a cow chasing someone who runs away.'

The titans applauded Vepacitti's verse, while the gods kept silent.

Then Vepacitti said to Sakka, 'Lord of gods, recite a verse!' So Sakka
recited this verse:

> 'Let him think this if he wishes, or not---\
> "He puts up with me out of fear."\
> Of goals culminating in one's own good,\
> none better than patience is found.
>
> When a strong person\
> puts up with a weakling,\
> they call that the ultimate patience,\
> for a weakling must always be patient.
>
> The strength of folly\
> is really just weakness, they say.\
> But no-one can challenge a person\
> who's strong, guarded by the teaching.
>
> When you get angry at an angry person\
> you just make things worse for yourself.\
> When you don't get angry at an angry person\
> you win a battle hard to win.
>
> When you know that the other is angry,\
> you act for the good of both\
> yourself and the other\
> if you're mindful and stay calm.
>
> People unfamiliar with the teaching\
> consider one who heals both\
> oneself and the other\
> to be a fool.'

The gods applauded Sakka's verses, while the titans kept silent.

Then the panel of judges consisting of both gods and titans said this,
'The verses spoken by Vepacitti evoke punishment and violence. That's
how you get arguments, quarrels, and disputes. The verses spoken by
Sakka don't evoke punishment and violence. That's how you stay free of
arguments, quarrels, and disputes.

Sakka, lord of gods, wins victory by fine words!'

And that's how Sakka came to win victory by fine words."

### N 11.6 Bird Nests *Kulāvakasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Once upon a time, mendicants, a battle was fought between the gods and
the titans. In that battle the titans won and the gods lost. Defeated,
the gods fled north with the titans in pursuit.

Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed his charioteer Mātali
in verse:

> 'Mātali, don't ram the bird nests\
> in the red silk-cotton woods with your chariot pole.\
> I'd rather give up our lives to the titans\
> than deprive these birds of their nests.'

'Yes, lord,' replied Mātali. And he turned the chariot back
around, with its team of a thousand thoroughbreds.

Then the titans thought, 'Now Sakka's chariot has turned back. The
titans will have to fight the gods a second time!' Terrified, they
retreated right away to the citadel of the titans.

And that's how Sakka came to win victory by principle."

<!--pg-->
### N 11.7 Not Betray *Nadubbhiyasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Once upon a time, mendicants, as Sakka, lord of gods, was in private
retreat this thought came to his mind, 'I should never betray even a
sworn enemy.'

And then Vepacitti, lord of titans, knowing Sakka's train of thought,
approached him.

Sakka saw Vepacitti coming off in the distance, and said to him, 'Stop,
Vepacitti, you're caught!'

'Dear sir, don't give up the idea you just had!'

'Swear, Vepacitti, that you won't betray me.'

> 'Whatever bad things happen to a liar,\
> or to someone who slanders the noble ones,\
> or to someone who betrays a friend,\
> or to someone who's ungrateful,\
> the same bad things impact\
> anyone who betrays you, Sujā's husband.'"

<!--pg-->
### N 11.8 Verocana, Lord of Titans *Verocanaasurindasutta*

Near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove.

Now at that time the Buddha had gone into retreat for the day's
meditation.

Then Sakka, lord of gods, and Verocana, lord of titans, approached the
Buddha and stationed themselves one by each door-post. Then Verocana
recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "A man should make an effort\
> until his goal is accomplished.\
> When goals are accomplished they shine:\
> this is the word of Verocana!"
>
> "A man should make an effort\
> until his goal is accomplished.\
> Of goals that shine when accomplished,\
> none better than patience is found."
>
> "All beings are goal-orientated,\
> as befits them in each case.\
> But connection is the ultimate\
> of pleasures for all living creatures.\
> When goals are accomplished they shine:\
> this is the word of Verocana!"
>
> "All beings are goal-orientated,\
> as befits them in each case.\
> But connection is the ultimate\
> of pleasures for all living creatures.\
> Of goals that shine when accomplished,\
> none better than patience is found."

<!--pg-->
### N 11.9 Seers in the Wilderness *Araññāyatanaisisutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Once upon a time, mendicants, several seers who were ethical, of good
character, settled in leaf huts in a wilderness region.

Then Sakka, lord of gods, and Vepacitti, lord of titans, went to those
seers. Vepacitti put on his boots, strapped on his sword, and, carrying
a sunshade, entered the hermitage through the main gate. He walked right
past those seers, keeping them at a distance.

Sakka took off his boots, gave his sword to others, and, putting down
his sunshade, entered the hermitage through a gate he happened upon. He
stood downwind of those seers, revering them with joined palms.

Then those seers addressed Sakka in verse:

> 'When seers have been long ordained,\
> the odor of their bodies goes with the gale.\
> You'd better leave, O thousand-eyed!\
> The odor of the seers is unclean, king of gods.'
>
> 'When seers have been long ordained,\
> let the odor of their bodies go with the gale.\
> We yearn for this odor, sirs,\
> like a colorful crown of flowers.\
> The gods don't see it as repulsive.'"

<!--pg-->
### N 11.10 Seers by the Ocean *Samuddakasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Once upon a time, mendicants, several seers who were ethical, of good
character, settled in leaf huts on the ocean shore.

Now at that time a battle was fought between the gods and the titans.

Then the seers thought, 'The gods are principled, the titans are
unprincipled. We may be at risk from the titans. Why don't we approach
Sambara, lord of titans, and beg him for a pledge of safety.'

Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm,
those seers vanished from those leaf huts on the ocean shore and
reappeared in Sambara's presence. Then those seers addressed Sambara in
verse:

> 'The seers have come to Sambara\
> to beg for a pledge of safety.\
> For you can give them what you wish,\
> whether danger or safety.'
>
> 'There is no safety for seers,\
> the hated associates of Sakka!\
> Though you beg me for your safety,\
> I'll only give you fear!'
>
> 'Though we beg you for our safety,\
> you give us only fear.\
> This is what we get from you:\
> may endless peril come to you!
>
> Whatever kind of seed you sow,\
> that is the fruit you reap.\
> A doer of good gets good,\
> a doer of bad gets bad.\
> You have sown your own seed, friend,\
> now you'll experience the fruit.'

Then those seers, having cursed Sambara, as easily as a strong person
would extend or contract their arm, vanished from Sambara's presence and
reappeared in those leaf huts on the ocean shore.

But after being cursed by the seers, Sambara woke in alarm three times
that night."

## Chapter Two

### N 11.11 Vows *Vatapadasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, in a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he
undertook seven vows. And it was because of undertaking these that he
achieved the status of Sakka. What seven?

As long as I live, may I support my parents. As long as I live, may I
honor the elders in the family. As long as I live, may I speak gently.
As long as I live, may I not speak divisively. As long as I live, may I
live at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous,
open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and
to share. As long as I live, may I speak the truth. As long as I live,
may I be free of anger, or should anger arise, may I quickly get rid of
it.

In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he undertook seven vows.
And it was because of undertaking these that he achieved the status of
Sakka.

> A person who respects their parents,\
> and honors the elders in the family,\
> whose speech is gentle and courteous,\
> and has given up divisiveness;
>
> who's committed to getting rid of stinginess,\
> is truthful, and has mastered anger:\
> the gods of the thirty-three\
> say they really are a true person."

<!--pg-->
### N 11.12 Sakka's Names *Sakkanāmasutta*

Near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove. There the Buddha said to the
mendicants:

"Mendicants, in a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he was a
student named Magha. That's why he's called Maghavā.

In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he was first to give
gifts. That's why he's called Purindada the Firstgiver.

In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he gave gifts ably.
That's why he's called Sakka the Able.

In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he gave the gift of a
guest house. That's why he's called Vāsava the Houser.

Sakka thinks of a thousand things in an hour. That's why he's called
Sahassakkha the Thousand-Eyed.

Sakka's wife is the titan maiden named Sujā. That's why
he's called Sujampati, Sujā's Husband.

Sakka rules as sovereign lord over the gods of the thirty-three. That's
why he's called lord of gods.

In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he undertook seven vows.
And it was because of undertaking these that he achieved the status of
Sakka. What seven?

### N 11.13 With Mahāli *Mahālisutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked
roof.

Then Mahāli the Licchavi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat
down to one side, and said to him, "Sir, have you seen Sakka, lord of
gods?"

"I have, Mahāli."

"But surely, sir, you must have seen someone who looked like Sakka. For
Sakka is hard to see."

"Mahāli, I understand Sakka. And I understand the things
that he undertook and committed to, which enabled him to achieve the
status of Sakka.

In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he was a student named
Magha. That's why he's called Maghavā.

In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he gave gifts ably.
That's why he's called Sakka the Able.

In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he was first to give
gifts. That's why he's called Purindada the Firstgiver.

Sakka thinks of a thousand things in an hour. That's why he's called
Sahassakkha the Thousand-Eyed.

Sakka's wife is the titan maiden named Sujā. That's why
he's called Sujampati, Sujā's Husband.

Sakka rules as sovereign lord over the gods of the thirty-three. That's
why he's called Devānaminda the lord of gods.

In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he undertook seven vows.
And it was because of undertaking these that he achieved the status of
Sakka. What seven?

As long as I live, may I support my parents. As long as I live, may I
honor the elders in the family. As long as I live, may I speak gently.

### N 11.14 Poor *Daliddasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the
Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding ground. There the Buddha addressed
the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a poor person, destitute and
pitiful. They took up faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom in
the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One. After
undertaking these things, when their body broke up, after death, they
were reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of the
gods of the thirty-three. There they outshone the other gods in beauty
and glory.

But the gods of the thirty-three complained, grumbled, and objected, 'Oh
lord, how incredible, how amazing! For when this god was a human being
in their past life they were poor, destitute, and pitiful. And when
their body broke up, after death, they were reborn in a good place, a
heavenly realm, in the company of the gods of the thirty-three. Here
they outshine the other gods in beauty and glory.'

Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the thirty-three, 'Good
fellows, don't complain about this god. When this god was a human being
in their past life they took up faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and
wisdom in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.
After undertaking these things, when their body broke up, after death,
they've been reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of
the gods of the thirty-three. Here they outshine the other gods in
beauty and glory.'

Then Sakka, lord of gods, guiding the gods of the thirty-three, recited
this verse:

> 'Whoever has faith in the Realized One,\
> unwavering and well grounded;\
> whose ethical conduct is good,\
> praised and loved by the noble ones;
>
> who has confidence in the Saṅgha,\
> and correct view:\
> they're said to be prosperous,\
> their life is not in vain.
>
> So let the wise devote themselves\
> to faith, ethical behaviour,\
> confidence, and insight into the teaching,\
> remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.'"

### N 11.15 Delightful *Rāmaṇeyyakasutta*

Near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove.

And then Sakka, lord of gods, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one
side, and said to him, "Sir, what is a delightful place?"

> "Shrines in parks and forests,\
> well-made lotus ponds,\
> are not worth a sixteenth part\
> of a delightful human being.
>
> Whether in village or wilderness,\
> in a valley or the uplands,\
> wherever the perfected ones live\
> is a delightful place."

<!--pg-->
### N 11.16 Sponsoring Sacrifice *Yajamānasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the
Vulture's Peak Mountain.

And then Sakka, lord of gods, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one
side, and addressed him in verse:

> "For humans, those merit-seeking creatures,\
> who sponsor sacrifices,\
> making worldly merit,\
> where is a gift very fruitful?"
>
> "Four practicing the path,\
> and four established in the fruit.\
> This is the sincere Saṅgha,\
> with wisdom, ethics, and immersion.
>
> For humans, those merit-seeking creatures,\
> who sponsor sacrifices,\
> making worldly merit,\
> what is given to the Saṅgha is very fruitful."

### N 11.17 Homage to the Buddha *Buddhavandanāsutta*

Near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove.

Now at that time the Buddha had gone into retreat for the day's
meditation. Then Sakka, lord of gods, and the divinity Sahampati
approached the Buddha and stationed themselves one by each door-post.

Then Sakka recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "Rise, hero! Victor in battle, with burden put down,\
> wander the world free of debt.\
> Your mind is fully liberated,\
> like the moon on the fifteenth night."

"Lord of gods, that's not how to pay homage to the Realized Ones. This
is how it should be done:

> 'Rise, hero! Victor in battle, leader of the caravan,\
> wander the world free of debt.\
> Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma!\
> There will be those who understand!'"

### N 11.18 Who Sakka Worships *Gahaṭṭhavandanāsutta*

At Sāvatthī.

"Once upon a time, mendicants, Sakka, lord of gods, addressed his
charioteer Mātali, 'My dear Mātali, harness
the chariot with its team of a thousand thoroughbreds. We will go to a
park and see the scenery.'

'Yes, lord,' replied Mātali. He harnessed the chariot and
informed Sakka, 'Good fellow, the chariot with its team of a thousand
thoroughbreds has been harnessed. Please go at your convenience.'

Then Sakka descended from the Palace of Victory, raised his joined
palms, and revered the different quarters.

So Mātali the charioteer addressed Sakka in verse:

> 'Those proficient in the three Vedas worship you,\
> as do all the aristocrats on earth,\
> the four great kings,\
> and the glorious thirty.\
> So what's the name of the spirit\
> that you worship, Sakka?'
>
> 'Those proficient in the three Vedas worship me,\
> as do all the aristocrats on earth,\
> the four great kings,\
> and the glorious thirty.
>
> But I revere those accomplished in ethics,\
> who have long trained in immersion,\
> who have rightly gone forth\
> committed to the spiritual life.
>
> I also worship those householders,\
> the ethical lay followers\
> who make merit, Mātali,\
> providing for a partner in a principled manner.'
>
> 'Those who you worship\
> seem to be the best in the world, Sakka.\
> I too will worship\
> those who you worship, Sakka.'
>
> After saying this, Maghavā the chief,\
> king of gods, Sujā's husband,\
> having worshipped the quarters\
> climbed into his chariot."

### N 11.20 Who Sakka Worships *Saṁghavandanāsutta*

Near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove.

"Once upon a time, mendicants, Sakka, lord of gods, addressed his
charioteer Mātali, 'My dear Mātali, harness
the chariot with its team of a thousand thoroughbreds. We will go to a

Then Sakka descended from the Palace of Victory, raised his joined
palms, and revered the mendicant Saṅgha.

So Mātali the charioteer addressed Sakka in verse:

> 'It's these who should worship you,\
> namely the humans stuck in their putrid bodies,\
> sunk in a carcass,\
> stricken by hunger and thirst.
>
> Why then do you envy those\

## Chapter Three

### N 11.21 Incinerated *Chetvāsutta*

Near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove.

And then Sakka, lord of gods, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one
side, and addressed him in verse:

> "When what is incinerated do you sleep at ease?\
> When what is incinerated is there no sorrow?\
> What is the one thing\
> whose killing you approve?"
>
> "When anger's incinerated you sleep at ease.\
> When anger's incinerated there is no sorrow.\
> O Vāsava, anger has a poisonous root\
> and a honey tip.\
> The noble ones praise its killing,\
> for when it's incinerated there is no sorrow."

<!--pg-->
### N 11.22 Ugly *Dubbaṇṇiyasutta*

Near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove.

"Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a native spirit who was ugly
and deformed. He sat on the throne of Sakka, lord of gods.

But the gods of the thirty-three complained, grumbled, and objected, 'Oh
lord, how incredible, how amazing! This ugly and deformed spirit is
sitting on the throne of Sakka, the lord of gods.' But the more the gods
complained, the more attractive, good-looking, and lovely that spirit
became.

So the gods went up to Sakka and told him what had happened, adding,
'Surely, good fellow, that must be the anger-eating spirit!'

Then Sakka went up to that spirit, arranged his robe over one shoulder,
knelt with his right knee on the ground, raised his joined palms toward
the anger-eating spirit, and pronounced his name three times: 'Good
fellow, I am Sakka, lord of gods! Good fellow, I am Sakka, the lord of
gods!' But the more Sakka pronounced his name, the uglier and more
deformed the spirit became, until eventually it vanished right there.

Then Sakka, lord of gods, guiding the gods of the thirty-three, recited
this verse:

> 'My mind isn't easily upset;\
> I'm not easily drawn into the maelstrom.\
> I don't get angry for long,\
> anger doesn't last in me.
>
> When I do get angry I don't speak harshly,\
> nor do I advertise my own virtues.\
> I carefully restrain myself\
> out of regard for my own welfare.'"

### N 11.23 The Sambari Sorcery *Sambarimāyāsutta*

At Sāvatthī.

The Buddha said this:

"Once upon a time, mendicants, Vepacitti, lord of titans, was sick,
suffering, gravely ill. So Sakka went to see him to ask after his
illness.

Vepacitti saw Sakka coming off in the distance, and said to him, 'Heal
me, lord of gods!'

'Teach me, Vepacitti, the Sambari sorcery.'

'I can't do that, good fellow, until I have consulted with the titans.'

Then Vepacitti, lord of titans, asked the titans, 'Good fellows, may I
teach the Sambari sorcery to Sakka, lord of gods?'

'Do not, good fellow, teach the Sambari sorcery to Sakka!'

So Vepacitti addressed Sakka in verse:

> 'O Maghavā, O Sakka,\
> king of gods, Sujā's husband,\
> a sorceror falls into the terrible hell---\
> like Sambara, for a hundred years.'"

<!--pg-->
### N 11.24 Transgression *Accayasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Now at that time two mendicants had clashed. One of them transgressed
against the other. The transgressor confessed to the other mendicant,
but they didn't accept it. Then several mendicants went up to the
Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.

"Mendicants, there are two fools. One who doesn't recognize when they've
made a mistake. And one who doesn't properly accept the confession of
someone who's made a mistake. These are the two fools.

There are two who are astute. One who recognizes when they've made a
mistake. And one who properly accepts the confession of someone who's
made a mistake. These are the two who are astute.

Once upon a time, mendicants, Sakka, lord of gods, guiding the gods of
the thirty-three, recited this verse:

> 'Control your anger;\
> don't let friendships decay.\
> Don't blame the blameless,\
> and don't say divisive things.\
> For anger crushes bad people\
> like a mountain.'"

<!--pg-->
### N 11.25 Don't Be Angry *Akkodhasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery.

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:

"Once upon a time, mendicants, Sakka, lord of gods, guiding the gods of
the thirty-three, recited this verse:

> 'Don't let anger be your master,\
> don't get angry at angry people.\
> Kindness and harmlessness\
> are always present in the noble ones.\
> For anger crushes bad people\
> like a mountain.'"
