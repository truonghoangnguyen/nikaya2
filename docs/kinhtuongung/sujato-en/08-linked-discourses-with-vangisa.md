# Linked Discourses With Vaṅgīsa

## The Chapter with the Poet Vaṅgīsa

### SN 8.1 Renounced *Nikkhantasutta*

So I have heard. At one time Venerable
Vaṅgīsa was staying near Āḷavī, at the
Aggāḷava Tree-shrine, together with his mentor, Venerable
Nigrodhakappa.

Now at that time Vaṅgīsa was junior, recently gone forth.
He had been left behind to look after the dwelling.

Then several women dressed in all their finery went to the monastery at
Aggāḷava in order to inspect the dwelling. When
Vaṅgīsa saw them he became dissatisfied, with lust
infecting his mind.

Then he thought, "It's my loss, my misfortune, that I've become
dissatisfied, with lust infecting my mind. How is it possible for
someone else to dispel my discontent and give rise to satisfaction? Why
don't I do it myself?"

Then, on the occasion of dispelling his own discontent and giving rise
to satisfaction, he recited these verses:

> "Now that I've renounced\
> the home life for homelessness\
> I'm overrun\
> by the rude thoughts of the Dark One.
>
> Even if a thousand mighty princes and great archers,\
> well trained, with strong bows,\
> were to completely surround me;\
> I would never flee.
>
> And even if women come,\
> many more than that,\
> they won't scare me,\
> for I stand firm in the teaching.
>
> I heard this with my own ears\
> from the Buddha, kinsman of the Sun,\
> about the path going to extinguishment;\
> that's what delights my mind.
>
> Wicked One, if you come near me\
> as I meditate like this,\
> I'll make sure that you, Death,\
> won't even see the path I take."

### SN 8.2 Dissatisfaction *Aratīsutta*

At one time Venerable Vaṅgīsa was staying near
Āḷavī, at the Aggāḷava Tree-shrine, together
with his mentor, Venerable Nigrodhakappa.

Now at that time after Venerable Nigrodhakappa had finished his meal, on
his return from almsround, he would enter his dwelling and not emerge
for the rest of that day, or the next.

And at that time Venerable Vaṅgīsa became dissatisfied, as
lust infected his mind.

Then he thought, "It's my loss, my misfortune, that I've become
dissatisfied, with lust infecting my mind. How is it possible for
someone else to dispel my discontent and give rise to satisfaction? Why
don't I do it myself?"

Then, on the occasion of dispelling his own discontent and giving rise
to satisfaction, he recited these verses:

> "Giving up discontent and desire,\
> along with all thoughts of domestic life,\
> they wouldn't get entangled in anything;\
> unentangled, undesiring: that's a real mendicant.
>
> Whether here on earth or in the air,\
> whatever in the world is included in form\
> wears out, it is all impermanent;\
> the thoughtful live having comprehended this truth.
>
> People are bound to their attachments,\
> to what is seen, heard, felt, and thought.\
> Unstirred, dispel desire for these things;\
> for one called 'a sage' does not cling to them.
>
> Attached to the sixty wrong views,\
> － and full of their own opinions,\
> ordinary people are fixed in wrong principles.\
> But that mendicant wouldn't join a sectarian group,\
> still less would they utter lewd speech.
>
> Clever, long serene,\
> free of deceit, alert, without envy,\
> the sage has reached the state of peace;\
> quenched, he awaits his time."

### SN 8.3 Good-Hearted *Pesalasutta*

At one time Venerable Vaṅgīsa was staying near
Āḷavī, at the Aggāḷava Tree-shrine, together
with his mentor, Venerable Nigrodhakappa.

Now at that time Venerable Vaṅgīsa looked down upon other
good-hearted mendicants because of his own poetic virtuosity.

Then he thought, "It's my loss, my misfortune, that I look down on other
good-hearted mendicants because of my own poetic virtuosity."

Then, on the occasion of arousing remorse in himself, he recited these
verses:

> "Give up conceit, Gotama!\
> Completely abandon the different kinds of conceit!\
> Besotted with the different kinds of conceit,\
> you've had regrets for a long time.
>
> Smeared by smears and slain by conceit,\
> people fall into hell.\
> When people slain by conceit are reborn in hell,\
> they grieve for a long time.
>
> But a mendicant who practices rightly,\
> winner of the path, never grieves.\
> They enjoy happiness and a good reputation,\
> and they rightly call him a 'Seer of Truth'.
>
> So don't be hard-hearted, be energetic,\
> with hindrances given up, be pure.\
> Then with conceit given up completely,\
> use knowledge to make an end, and be calmed."

### SN 8.4 With Ānanda *Ānandasutta*

At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and
robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms with Venerable
Vaṅgīsa as his second monk.

And at that time Venerable Vaṅgīsa became dissatisfied, as
lust infected his mind. Then he addressed Ānanda in verse:

> "I've got a burning desire for pleasure;\
> My mind is on fire!\
> Please, out of compassion, Gotama,\
> tell me how to quench the flames."
>
> "Your mind is on fire\
> because of a perversion of perception.\
> Turn away from the feature of things\
> that's attractive, provoking lust.
>
> See all conditioned phenomena as other,\
> as suffering and not-self.\
> Extinguish the great fire of lust,\
> don't burn up again and again.
>
> With mind unified and serene,\
> meditate on the ugly aspects of the body.\
> With mindfulness immersed in the body,\
> be full of disillusionment.
>
> Meditate on the signless,\
> give up the underlying tendency to conceit;\
> and when you comprehend conceit,\
> you will live at peace."

### SN 8.5 Well-Spoken Words *Subhāsitasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, speech that has four factors is well spoken, not poorly
spoken. It's blameless and is not criticized by sensible people. What
four? It's when a mendicant speaks well, not poorly; they speak on the
teaching, not against the teaching; they speak pleasantly, not
unpleasantly; and they speak truthfully, not falsely. Speech with these
four factors is well spoken, not poorly spoken. It's blameless and is
not criticized by sensible people."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "Good people say well-spoken words are foremost;\
> second, speak on the teaching, not against it;\
> third, speak pleasantly, not unpleasantly;\
> and fourth, speak truthfully, not falsely."

Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his
robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and
said, "I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak,
Holy One!"

"Then speak as you feel inspired," said the Buddha.

Then Vaṅgīsa extolled the Buddha in his presence with
fitting verses:

> "Speak only such words\
> as do not hurt yourself\
> nor harm others;\
> such speech is truly well spoken.
>
> Speak only pleasing words,\
> words gladly welcomed.\
> Pleasing words are those\
> that bring nothing bad to others.
>
> Truth itself is the undying word:\
> this is an ancient teaching.\
> Good people say that the teaching and its meaning\
> are grounded in the truth.
>
> The words spoken by the Buddha\
> for finding the sanctuary, extinguishment,\
> for making an end of suffering:\
> this really is the best kind of speech."

### SN 8.6 With Sāriputta *Sāriputtasutta*

At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery.

Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was educating,
encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants in the assembly
hall with a Dhamma talk. His words were polished, clear, articulate, and
expressed the meaning. And those mendicants were paying attention,
applying the mind, concentrating wholeheartedly, and actively listening.

Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa thought, "This Venerable
Sāriputta is educating the mendicants. ... And those
mendicants are paying attention, applying the mind, concentrating
wholeheartedly, and actively listening. Why don't I extoll him in his
presence with fitting verses?"

Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his
robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward
Sāriputta, and said, "I feel inspired to speak, Reverend
Sāriputta! I feel inspired to speak, Reverend
Sāriputta!"

"Then speak as you feel inspired," said Sāriputta.

Then Vaṅgīsa extolled Sāriputta in his
presence with fitting verses:

> "Deep in wisdom, intelligent,\
> expert in what is the path\
> － and what is not the path;\
> Sāriputta, so greatly wise,\
> teaches Dhamma to the mendicants.
>
> He teaches in brief,\
> or he speaks at length.\
> His call, like a myna bird,\
> overflows with inspiration.
>
> While he teaches\
> the mendicants listen to his sweet voice,\
> sounding attractive,\
> clear and graceful.\
> They listen joyfully,\
> their hearts elated."

### SN 8.7 The Invitation to Admonish *Pavāraṇāsutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the
stilt longhouse of Migāra's mother in the Eastern
Monastery, together with a large Saṅgha of around five
hundred monks, all of whom were perfected ones. Now, at that time it was
the sabbath---the full moon on the fifteenth day---and the Buddha was
sitting in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks for
the invitation to admonish.

Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks, who were
silent. He addressed them: "Come now, monks, I invite you all: Is there
anything I've done by way of body or speech that you would criticize?"

When he had spoken, Venerable Sāriputta got up from his
seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms
toward the Buddha, and said: "There is nothing, sir, that you've done by
way of body or speech that we would criticize. For the Blessed One gave
rise to the unarisen path, gave birth to the unborn path, and explained
the unexplained path. He is the knower of the path, the discoverer of
the path, the expert on the path. And now the disciples live following
the path; they acquire it later. And sir, I invite the Blessed One. Is
there anything I've done by way of body or speech that you would
criticize?"

"There is nothing, Sāriputta, that you've done by way of
body or speech that I would criticize. Sāriputta, you are
astute. You have great wisdom, widespread wisdom, laughing wisdom, swift
wisdom, sharp wisdom, penetrating wisdom. A wheel-turning monarch's
oldest son rightly keeps wielding the power set in motion by his father.
In the same way, Sāriputta rightly keeps rolling the
supreme Wheel of Dhamma that was rolled forth by me."

"Since it seems I have done nothing worthy of the Blessed One's
criticism, is there anything these five hundred monks have done by way
of body or speech that you would criticize?"

"There is nothing, Sāriputta, that these five hundred monks
have done by way of body or speech that I would criticize. For of these
five hundred monks, sixty have the three knowledges, sixty have the six
direct knowledges, sixty are freed both ways, and the rest are freed by
wisdom."

Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his
robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and
said, "I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak,
Holy One!"

"Then speak as you feel inspired," said the Buddha.

Then Vaṅgīsa extolled the Buddha in his presence with
fitting verses:

> "Today, on the fifteenth day sabbath,\
> five hundred monks have gathered together\
> － to purify their precepts.\
> These untroubled sages\
> － have cut off their fetters and bonds,\
> they will not be reborn again.
>
> Just as a wheel-turning monarch\
> surrounded by ministers\
> travels all around this\
> land that's girt by sea.
>
> So disciples with the three knowledges,\
> conquerors of death,\
> revere the winner of the battle,\
> the unsurpassed caravan leader.
>
> All are sons of the Blessed One---\
> there is no rubbish here.\
> I bow to the kinsman of the Sun,\
> destroyer of the dart of craving."

### SN 8.8 Over a Thousand *Parosahassasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery, together with a large
Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants.

Now at that time the Buddha was educating, encouraging, firing up, and
inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk about extinguishment. And
those mendicants were paying attention, applying the mind, concentrating
wholeheartedly, and actively listening.

Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa thought, "The Buddha is educating,
encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk
about extinguishment. And those mendicants are paying attention,
applying the mind, concentrating wholeheartedly, and actively listening.
Why don't I extoll him in his presence with fitting verses?"

Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his
robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and
said, "I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak,
Holy One!"

"Then speak as you feel inspired," said the Buddha.

Then Vaṅgīsa extolled the Buddha in his presence with
fitting verses:

> "Over a thousand mendicants\
> revere the Holy One\
> as he teaches the immaculate Dhamma,\
> extinguishment, fearing nothing from any quarter.
>
> They listen to the immaculate Dhamma\
> taught by the fully awakened Buddha;\
> the Buddha is so brilliant,\
> at the fore of the mendicant Saṅgha,
>
> Blessed One, your name is 'Giant',\
> seventh of the sages.\
> You are like a great cloud\
> that rains on your disciples.
>
> I've left my day's meditation,\
> out of desire to see the teacher.\
> Great hero, your disciple Vaṅgīsa\
> bows at your feet."

"Vaṅgīsa, had you previously composed these verses, or did
they spring to mind in the moment?"

"They sprang to mind in the moment, sir."

"Well then, Vaṅgīsa, speak some more spontaneously inspired
verses."

"Yes, sir," replied Vaṅgīsa. Then he extolled the Buddha
with some more spontaneously inspired verses, not previously composed:

> "Having overcome Māra's devious path,\
> you wander with hard-heartedness dissolved.\
> See him, the liberator from bonds, unattached,\
> analyzing the teaching.
>
> You have explained in many ways\
> the path to cross the flood.\
> The Seers of Truth stand unfaltering\
> in the freedom from death you've explained.
>
> As the bringer of light who has pierced the truth,\
> you've seen what lies beyond all realms.\
> When you saw and realized this for yourself,\
> you taught it first to the group of five.
>
> When the Dhamma has been so well taught,\
> how could those who know it be negligent?\
> That's why, being diligent, we should always train\
> respectfully in the Buddha's teaching."

### SN 8.9 With Koṇḍañña *Koṇḍaññasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the
Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding ground.

Then Venerable Koṇḍañña Who Understood approached the
Buddha after a very long absence. He bowed with his head at the Buddha's
feet, caressing them and covering them with kisses, and pronounced his
name: "I am Koṇḍañña, Blessed One! I am
Koṇḍañña, Holy One!"

Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa thought, "This Venerable
Koṇḍañña Who Understood has approached the Buddha after a
very long absence. He bowed with his head at the Buddha's feet,
caressing them and covering them with kisses, and pronounced his name:
'I am Koṇḍañña, Blessed One! I am Koṇḍañña,
Holy One!' Why don't I extoll him in the Buddha's presence with fitting
verses?"

Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his
robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and
said, "I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak,
Holy One!"

"Then speak as you feel inspired," said the Buddha.

Then Vaṅgīsa extolled Koṇḍañña in the Buddha's
presence with fitting verses:

> "The senior monk who was awakened\
> － right after the Buddha,\
> Koṇḍañña, is keenly energetic.\
> He regularly gains blissful meditative states,\
> and the three kinds of seclusion.
>
> Whatever can be attained by a disciple\
> who does the Teacher's bidding,\
> he has attained it all,\
> through diligently training himself.
>
> With great power and the three knowledges,\
> expert in comprehending the minds of others,\
> Koṇḍañña, the heir to the Buddha,\
> bows at the Teacher's feet."

### SN 8.10 With Moggallāna *Moggallānasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying on the slopes of Isigili at the Black
Rock, together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred
mendicants, all of whom were perfected ones. Thereupon, with his mind,
Venerable Mahāmoggallāna checked to see whose mind was
liberated and free of attachments.

Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa thought, "The Buddha is staying on
the slopes of Isigili ... with five hundred perfected ones.
Mahāmoggallāna is checking to see whose mind is liberated
and free of attachments. Why don't I extoll him in the Buddha's presence
with fitting verses?"

Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his
robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and
said, "I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak,
Holy One!"

"Then speak as you feel inspired," said the Buddha.

Then Vaṅgīsa extolled Mahāmoggallāna in his
presence with fitting verses:

> the sage gone beyond suffering,\
> who is endowed with all path factors,\
> and with a multitude of attributes."

Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants, seven hundred male and
seven hundred female lay followers, and many thousands of deities. But
the Buddha outshone them all in beauty and glory.

Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa thought, "The Buddha is staying near
Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond,

> your glory outshines the entire world."

### SN 8.12 With Vaṅgīsa *Vaṅgīsasutta*

At one time Venerable Vaṅgīsa was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery.

Now at that time Vaṅgīsa had recently attained perfection.
While experiencing the bliss of freedom, on that occasion he recited
these verses:

> "We used to wander, drunk on poetry,\
> village to village, town to town.\
> Then we saw the Buddha,\
> and faith arose in us.
>
> He taught me Dhamma:\
> the aggregates, sense fields, and elements.\
> When I heard his teaching\
> I went forth to homelessness.
>
> It was truly for the benefit of many\
> that the sage achieved awakening---\
> for the monks and for the nuns\
> who see that they've reached certainty.
>
> It was so welcome for me\
> to be in the presence of the Buddha.\
> I've attained the three knowledges,\
> and fulfilled the Buddha's instructions.
>
> I know my past lives,\
> my clairvoyance is purified,\
> I am master of three knowledges,\
> － attained in psychic power,\
> expert in comprehending the minds of others."
