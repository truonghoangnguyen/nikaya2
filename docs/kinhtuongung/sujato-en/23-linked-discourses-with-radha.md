## First Chapter About Māra

### SN 23.1 About Māra *Mārasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Then Venerable Rādha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down
to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, they speak of this thing called 'Māra'. How is
Māra defined?"

"When there is form, Rādha, there may be Māra,
or the murderer, or the murdered. So you should see form as
Māra, the murderer, the murdered, the diseased, the boil,
the dart, the misery, the miserable. Those who see it like this see
rightly. When there is feeling ... perception ... choices ...
consciousness, there may be Māra, or the murderer, or the
murdered. So you should see consciousness as Māra, the
murderer, the murdered, the diseased, the boil, the dart, the misery,
the miserable. Those who see it like this see rightly."

"But sir, what's the purpose of seeing rightly?"

"Disillusionment is the purpose of seeing rightly."

"But what's the purpose of disillusionment?"

"Dispassion is the purpose of disillusionment."

"But what's the purpose of dispassion?"

"Freedom is the purpose of dispassion."

"But what's the purpose of freedom?"

"Extinguishment is the purpose of freedom."

"But sir, what is the purpose of extinguishment?"

"Your question goes too far, Rādha. You couldn't figure out
the limit of questions. For extinguishment is the culmination,
destination, and end of the spiritual life."

### SN 23.2 Sentient Beings *Sattasutta*

At Sāvatthī.

Seated to one side, Venerable Rādha said to the Buddha:

"Sir, they speak of this thing called a 'sentient being'. How is a
sentient being defined?"

"Rādha, when you cling, strongly cling, to desire, greed,
relishing, and craving for form, then a being is spoken of. When you
cling, strongly cling, to desire, greed, relishing, and craving for
feeling ... perception ... choices ... consciousness, then a being is
spoken of.

Suppose some boys or girls were playing with sandcastles. As long as
they're not rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving
for those sandcastles, they cherish them, fancy them, treasure them, and
treat them as their own. But when they are rid of greed, desire,
fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for those sandcastles, they
scatter, smash, and destroy them with their hands and feet, making them
unplayable.

In the same way, you should scatter, smash, and destroy form, making it
unplayable. And you should practice for the ending of craving. You
should scatter, smash, and destroy feeling ... perception ... choices
... consciousness, making it unplayable. And you should practice for the
ending of craving. For the ending of craving is extinguishment."

Seated to one side, Venerable Rādha said to the Buddha:

"Sir, they speak of this thing called 'the cessation of the conduit to
rebirth'. What is the conduit to rebirth? And what is the cessation of
the conduit to rebirth?"

"Rādha, any desire, greed, relishing, and craving for form;
and any attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insistence, and
underlying tendencies---this is called the conduit to rebirth. Their
cessation is the cessation of the conduit to rebirth.

Any desire, greed, relishing, and craving for feeling ... perception ...
choices ... consciousness; and any attraction, grasping, mental
fixation, insistence, and underlying tendencies---this is called the
conduit to rebirth. Their cessation is the cessation of the conduit to
rebirth."

completely understood, complete understanding, and the person who has
completely understood. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," Rādha replied. The Buddha said this:

"And what things should be completely understood? Form, feeling,
perception, choices, and consciousness. These are called the things that
should be completely understood.

And what is complete understanding? The ending of greed, hate, and
delusion. This is called complete understanding.

And what is the person who has completely understood? It should be said:
a perfected one, the venerable of such and such name and clan. This is
called the person who has completely understood."

five? The grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and
consciousness.

There are ascetics and brahmins who don't truly understand these five
grasping aggregates' gratification, drawback, and escape. I don't deem

goal of life as an ascetic or brahmin, and don't live having realized it
with their own insight.

There are ascetics and brahmins who do truly understand these five
grasping aggregates' gratification, drawback, and escape. I deem them as

grasping aggregates' origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape
... Those venerables don't realize the goal of life as an ascetic or
brahmin ...

When Venerable Rādha was seated to one side, the Buddha
said to him:

"Rādha, there are these five grasping aggregates. What
five? The grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and
consciousness. When a noble disciple truly understands these five
grasping aggregates' origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and
escape, they're called a noble disciple who is a stream-enterer, not
liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening."

five? The grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and
consciousness. A mendicant comes to be freed by not grasping after truly
understanding these five grasping aggregates' origin, ending,
gratification, drawback, and escape. Such a mendicant is called a
perfected one, with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual
journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their
own true goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is
rightly freed through enlightenment."

At Sāvatthī.

When Venerable Rādha was seated to one side, the Buddha
said to him:

and craving for form. Thus that form will be given up, cut off at the
root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the
future.

You should give up any desire, greed, relishing, and craving for feeling

"Rādha, form is Māra, feeling is
Māra, perception is Māra, choices are
Māra, consciousness is Māra.

Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form,
feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. Being disillusioned,
desire fades away. When desire fades away they're freed. When they're
freed, they know they're freed.

They understand: 'Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been
completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further
for this place.'"
