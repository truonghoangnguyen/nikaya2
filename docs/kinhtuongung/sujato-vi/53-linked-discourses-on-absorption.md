## The Chapter of Abbreviated Texts on the Ganges

### N 53.1--12 Absorptions, Etc. *Gaṅgāpeyyālavagga*

At Sāvatthī.

"Mendicants, there are these four absorptions. What four?

It's when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded
from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption,
which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the
mind and keeping it connected.

As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they
enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and
bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without
placing the mind and keeping it connected.

And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third
absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware,
personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare,
'Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.'

Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness,
they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or
pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.

These are the four absorptions.

The Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east. In the same
way, a mendicant who develops and cultivates the four absorptions
slants, slopes, and inclines to extinguishment.

And how does a mendicant who develops and cultivates the four
absorptions slant, slope, and incline to extinguishment?

It's when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded
from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption,
which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the
mind and keeping it connected.

As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they
enter and remain in the second absorption ... third absorption ...
fourth absorption.

That's how a mendicant who develops and cultivates the four absorptions
slants, slopes, and inclines to extinguishment."

## The Chapter on Floods

### N 53.45--54 Floods, etc. *Oghavagga*

"Mendicants, there are five higher fetters. What five? Desire for
rebirth in the realm of luminous form, desire for rebirth in the
formless realm, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. These are the five
higher fetters.

The four absorptions should be developed for the direct knowledge,
complete understanding, finishing, and giving up of these five higher
fetters. What four? It's when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual
pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the
first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion,
while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the
mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the
second absorption ... third absorption ... fourth absorption. These four
absorptions should be developed for the direct knowledge, complete
understanding, finishing, and giving up of these five higher fetters."
