# 4. Morning of the Stroke

It was 7:00 am on December 10, 1996. I awoke to the familiar
tick-tick-tick of my compact disc player as it began winding up to play.
Sleepily, I hit the snooze button just in time to catch the next mental
wave back into dreamland. Here, in this magic land I call "Thetaville" a surreal place of altered consciousness somewhere between dreams and
stark reality - my spirit beamed beautiful, fluid, and free from the
confines of normal reality.

Six minutes later, as the tick-tick-tick of the CD alerted my
memory that I was a land mammal, I sluggishly awoke to a sharp pain
piercing my brain directly behind my left eye. Squinting into the early
morning light, I clicked off the impending alarm with my right hand and
instinctively pressed the palm of my left hand firmly against the side of
my face. Rarely ill, I thought how queer it was for me to awaken to such
a striking pain. As my left eye pulsed with a slow and deliberate rhythm,
I felt bewildered and irritated. The throbbing pain behind my eye was
sharp, like the caustic sensation that sometimes accompanies biting into
ice cream.

As I rolled out of my warm waterbed, I stumbled into the world
with the ambivalence of a wounded soldier. I closed the bedroom
window blind to block the incoming stream of light from stinging my
eyes. I decided that exercise might get my blood flowing and perhaps
help dissipate the pain. Within moments, I hopped on to my "cardioglider" (a full body exercise machine) and began jamming away to

Shania Twain singing the lyrics, "Whose bed have your boots been
under?". Immediately, I felt a powerful and unusual sense of
dissociation roll over me. I felt so peculiar that I questioned my wellbeing. Even though my thoughts seemed lucid, my body felt irregular.
As I watched my hands and arms rocking forward and back, forward
and back, in opposing synchrony with my torso, I felt strangely
detached from my normal cognitive functions. It was as if the integrity
of my mind/body connection had somehow become compromised.

Feeling detached from normal reality, I seemed to be witnessing
my activity as opposed to feeling like the active participant performing
the action. I felt as though I was observing myself in motion, as in the
playback of a memory. My fingers, as they grasped onto the handrail,
looked like primitive claws. For a few seconds I rocked and watched,
with riveting wonder, as my body oscillated rhythmically and
mechanically. My torso moved up and down in perfect cadence with the
music and my head continued to ache.

I felt bizarre, as if my conscious mind was suspended somewhere
between my normal reality and some esoteric space. Although this
experience was somewhat reminiscent of my morning time in Thetaville,
I was sure that this time I was awake. Yet, I felt as if I was trapped inside
the perception of a meditation that I could neither stop nor
escape. Feeling dazed, the frequency of shooting pangs escalated inside
my brain, and I realized that this exercise regime was probably not a
good idea.

Feeling a little nervous about my physical condition, I climbed off
the machine and bumbled through my living room on the way to the
bath. As I walked, I noticed that my movements were no longer fluid.
Instead they felt deliberate and almost jerky. In the absence of my
normal muscular coordination, there was no grace to my pace and my
balance was so impaired that my mind seemed completely preoccupied
with just keeping me upright.

As I lifted my leg to step into the tub, I held on to the wall for
support. It seemed odd that I could sense the inner activities of my brain
as it adjusted and readjusted all of the opposing muscle groups in my
lower extremities to prevent me from falling over. My perception of
these automatic body responses was no longer an exercise in intellectual
conceptualization. Instead, I was momentarily privy to a precise and
experiential understanding of how hard the fifty trillion cells in my brain
and body were working in perfect unison to maintain the flexibility and
integrity of my physical form. Through the eyes of an avid enthusiast of
the magnificence of the human design, I witnessed with awe the
autonomic functioning of my nervous system as it calculated and
recalculated every joint angle.

Ignorant to the degree of danger my body was in, I balanced my
weight against the shower wall. As I leaned forward to turn on the
faucet, I was startled by an abrupt and exaggerated clamor as water
surged into the tub. This unexpected amplification of sound was both
enlightening and disturbing. It brought me to the realization that, in
addition to having problems with coordination and equilibrium, my
ability to process incoming sound (auditory information) was erratic.

I understood neuroanatomically that coordination, equilibrium,
audition and the action of inspirational
breathing were processed through the pons of my brainstem. For
the first time, I considered the possibility that I was perhaps
having a major neurological malfunction that was life
threatening.

Fibers Passing Through the Pons of the Brainstem

As my cognitive mind searched for an explanation about
what was happening anatomically inside my brain, I reeled
backward in response to the augmented roar of the water as the
unexpected noise pierced my delicate and aching brain. In that
instant, I suddenly felt vulnerable, and I noticed that the constant
brain chatter that routinely familiarized me with my
surroundings was no longer a predictable and constant flow of
conversation. Instead, my verbal thoughts were now inconsistent,
fragmented, and interrupted by an intermittent silence.

>Wernicke's Area: Vùng Wernicke

When I realized that the sensations outside of me, including the
remote sounds of a bustling city beyond my apartment window, had
faded away, I could tell that the broad range of my natural observation
had become constricted. As my brain chatter began to disintegrate, I felt
an odd sense of isolation. My blood pressure must have been dropping
as a result of the bleeding in my brain because I felt as if all of my
systems, including my mind's ability to instigate movement, were
moving into a slow mode of operation. Yet, even though my thoughts
were no longer a constant stream of chatter about the external world and
my relationship to it, I was conscious and constantly present within my
mind.

Confused, I searched the memory banks of both my body and
brain, questioning and analyzing anything I could remember having
experienced in the past that was remotely similar to this situation. _What_
_is going on?_ I wondered. _Have I ever experienced anything like this_
_before? Have I ever felt like this before? This feels like a migraine. What_
_is happening in my brain?_

The harder I tried to concentrate, the more fleeting my ideas
seemed to be. Instead of finding answers and information, I met a
growing sense of peace. In place of that constant chatter that had
attached me to the details of my life, I felt enfolded by a blanket of
tranquil euphoria. How fortunate I was that the portion of my brain that
registered fear, my amygdala, had not reacted with alarm to these
unusual circumstances and shifted me into a state of panic. As the
language centers in my left hemisphere grew increasingly silent and I
became detached from the memories of my life, I was comforted by an
expanding sense of grace. In this void of higher cognition and details
pertaining to my normal life, my consciousness soared into an all
_one_
knowingness, a "being at " with the universe, if you will. In a
compelling sort of way, it felt like the good road home and I liked it.

By this point I had lost touch with much of the
physical three-dimensional reality that surrounded me. My body
was propped up against the shower wall and I found it odd that I
was aware that I could no longer clearly discern the physical
boundaries of where I began and where I ended. I sensed the
composition of my being as that of a fluid rather than that of a
solid. I no longer perceived myself as a whole object separate
from everything. Instead, I now blended in with the space and
flow around me. Beholding a growing sense of detachment
between my cognitive mind and my ability to control and finely
manipulate my fingers, the mass of my body felt heavy and my
energy waned.

When the shower droplets beat into my chest like little
bullets, I was harshly startled back into this reality. As I held my
hands up in front of my face and wiggled my fingers, I was
simultaneously perplexed and intrigued. _Wow, what a strange and_
_amazing thing I am. What a bizarre living being I am. Life! I am_
_life! I am a sea of water bound inside this membranous pouch._
_Here, in this form, I am a conscious mind and this body is the_
_vehicle through which I am ALIVE! I am trillions of cells sharing_
_a common mind. I am here, now, thriving as life. Wow! What an_
_unfathomable concept! I am cellular life, no - I am molecular life_
_with manual dexterity and a cognitive mind!_

In this altered state of being, my mind was no longer
preoccupied with the billions of details that my brain routinely
used to define and conduct my life in the external world. Those
little voices, that brain chatter that customarily kept me abreast of
myself in relation to the world outside of me, were delightfully
silent. And in their absence, my memories of the past and my dreams of the future evaporated. I was
alone. In the moment, I was alone with nothing but the rhythmic pulse of
my beating heart.

I must admit that the growing void in my traumatized brain was
entirely seductive. I welcomed the reprieve that the silence brought from
the constant chatter that related me to what I now perceived as the
insignificant affairs of society. I eagerly turned my focus inward to the
steadfast drumming of the trillions of brilliant cells that worked
diligently and synchronously to maintain my body's steady state of
homeostasis. As the blood poured in over my brain, my consciousness
slowed to a soothing and satisfying awareness that embraced the vast
and wondrous world within. I was both fascinated and humbled by how
hard my little cells worked, moment by moment, just to maintain the
integrity of my existence in this physical form.

For the first time, I felt truly at one with my body as a complex
construction of living, thriving organisms. I was proud to see that I was
this swarming conglomeration of cellular life that had stemmed from the
intelligence of a single molecular genius! I welcomed the opportunity to
pass beyond my normal perceptions, away from the persevering pain that
relentlessly pulsed in my head. As my consciousness slipped into a state
of peaceful grace, I felt ethereal. Although the pulse of pain in my brain
was inescapable, it was not debilitating.

Standing there with the water pounding onto my breasts, a tingling
sensation surged through my chest and forcefully radiated upward into
my throat. Startled, I became instantly aware that I was in grave danger.
Shocked back into this external reality, I immediately reassessed the
abnormalities of my physical systems. Determined to understand what
was going on, I actively scanned my reservoir of education in demand of
a self-diagnosis. _What is going on with my body? What is wrong with my_
_brain?_

Although the sporadically discontinuous flow of

normal cognition was virtually incapacitating, somehow I managed to
keep my body on task. Stepping out of the shower, my brain felt
inebriated. My body was unsteady, felt heavy, and exerted itself in very
slow motion. _What is it I'm trying to do ? Dress, dress for work. I'm_
_dressing for work._ I labored mechanically to choose my clothes and by
8:15 am, I was ready for my commute. Pacing my apartment, I thought,
_Okay, I'm going to work. I'm going to work. Do I know how to get to_
_work? Can I drive?_ As I visualized the road to McLean Hospital, I was
literally thrown off balance when my right arm dropped completely
paralyzed against my side. In that moment I knew. _Oh my gosh, I'm_
_having a stroke! I'm having a stroke!_ And in the next instant, the thought
flashed through my mind, _Wow, this is so cool!_

I felt as though I was suspended in a peculiar euphoric stupor, and
I was strangely elated when I understood that this unexpected
pilgrimage into the intricate functions of my brain actually had a
physiological basis and explanation. I kept thinking, _Wow, how many_
_scientists have the opportunity to study their own brain function and_
_mental deterioration from the inside out?_ My entire life had been
dedicated to my own understanding of how the human brain creates our
perception of reality. And now I was experiencing this most remarkable
stroke of insight!

When my right arm became paralyzed, I felt the life force inside
the limb explode. When it dropped dead against my body, it clubbed my
torso. It was the strangest sensation. I felt as if my arm had been
guillotined off!

![MOVEMENT AND SENSORY PERCEPTION: Vận động và Cảm nhận giác quan](/jill-stroke/img362.jpg)

I understood neuroanatomically that my motor cortex had been
affected and I was fortunate that within a few minutes, the deadness of
my right arm subtly abated. As the limb began to reclaim its life, it
throbbed with a formidable tingling pain. I felt weak and wounded. My
arm felt completely depleted of its intrinsic strength, yet I could wield it
like a stub. I wondered if it would ever be normal again. Catching sight
of my warm and cradling waterbed, I seemed to be beckoned by it on
this cold winter morning in New England. _Oh, I am so tired. I feel so_
_tired. I just want to rest. I just want to lie down and relax for a little_
_while._ But resounding like thunder from deep within my being, a
commanding voice spoke clearly to me: _If you lie down now you will_
_never get up!_

Startled by this ominous illumination, I fathomed the gravity of
my immediate situation. Although I was compelled by a sense of
urgency to orchestrate my rescue, another part of me delighted in the
euphoria of my irrationality. I stepped across the threshold of my
bedroom, and as I gazed into the eyes of my reflected image, I paused
for a moment, in search of some guidance or profound insight. In the
wisdom of my dementia, I understood that my body was, by the
magnificence of its biological design, a precious and fragile gift. It was
clear to me that this body functioned like a portal through which the
energy of who I am can be beamed into a three-dimensional external
space.

This cellular mass of my body had provided me with a marvelous
temporary home. This amazing brain had been capable of integrating
literally billions of trillions of bits of data, in every instant, to create for
me a three-dimensional perception of this environment that actually
appeared to be not only seamless and real, but also safe. Here in this
delusion, I was mesmerized by the efficiency of this biological matrix as
it created my form, and I was awed by the simplicity of its design. I saw
myself as a complex composite of dynamic systems, a collection of
interlacing cells capable of
integrating a medley of sensory modalities streaming in from the
external world. And when the systems functioned properly, they
naturally manifested a consciousness capable of perceiving a
normal reality. I wondered how I could have spent so many years
in this body, in this form of life, and never really understood that
I was just visiting here.

Even in this condition, the egotistical mind of my left
hemisphere arrogantly retained the belief that although I was
experiencing a dramatic mental incapacity, my life was
invincible. Optimistically, I believed that I would recover
completely from this morning's events. Feeling a little irritated
by this impromptu disruption of my work schedule, I bantered,
_Okay, well, I'm having a stroke. Yep, I'm having a stroke...but I'm_
_a very busy woman! All right, since I can't stop this stroke from_
_happening, then, okay, I'll do this for a week! I'll learn what I_
_need to know about how my brain creates my perception of_
_reality and then I'll meet my schedule, next week. Now, what am_
_I doing? Getting help. I must stay focused and get help._

To my counterpart in the looking glass I pleaded,

_Remember, please remember everything you are experiencing!_
_Let this be my stroke of insight into the disintegration of my own_
_cognitive mind._
