# 11. Healing and Preparing for Surgery

On December 15, 1996 I returned to my Winchester apartment
where I now had less than two weeks to prepare for surgery. I lived on
the second floor of a two-family home so I had to sit on my butt and
bop myself up the stairs (No, that's not the way the physical therapist
taught me to do it!). By the time I made it up that last step, I was
drained and my brain craved sleep. I was home. Finally. Home, where
I could crawl into a hole and hibernate without extraneous
interruptions. All of me longed for healing quietude. I collapsed on my
waterbed and passed out.

I was totally blessed to have G.G. as my caregiver. If you ask
her, she will tell you that she had no idea what she needed to do - she
just let things unfold naturally, step by step. She intuitively understood
that to get from A to C, I had to learn A, then B, and then C. It was as
if I had an infant brain again and had to learn virtually everything from
scratch. I was back to the basics. How to walk. How to talk. How to
read. How to write. How to put a puzzle together. The process of
physical recovery was just like stages of normal development. I had to
go through each stage, master that level of ability, and then the next
step unfolded naturally. Methodically, I had to learn to rock and then
roll over before I could sit up. I had to sit up and rock forward before I
could stand. I had to stand before I could take that first step, and I had
to be relatively stable on my feet before I could climb a stair by
myself.

Most important, I had to be willing to _try._ The _try_ is everything.
The _try_ is me saying to my brain, _hey, I value this connection and I want_
_it to happen._ I may have to try, try, and try again with no results for a
thousand times before I get even an inkling of a result, but if I don't _try_,
it may never happen.

G.G. started the process of walking me by taking me back and
forth between my bed and the bathroom. That was enough exercise for
the day! Then it was back to sleep for another six hours! The first few
days were like that. Lots of sleep, lots of energy expended to get to the
bathroom or be fed, maybe a brief time for snuggling. Then it was back
to sleep until the next go around. Once I mastered the trek to the
bathroom, I headed for the living room couch where I could sit up and
eat some food. Learning to use a spoon with grace took some serious
effort.

One of the keys to my successful recovery was that both G.G. and
I were extremely patient with me. Neither of us bemoaned what I could
not do; instead we always marveled at what I could do. My mother's
favorite saying during moments of trauma had always been, "It could be
worse!" And we both agreed, as bleak as my situation appeared on the
surface, it could have been a lot worse. I have to say, G.G. was really
wonderful during this process. I was the youngest of three and my
mother had been a very busy woman during my toddler years. It was
really sweet for me to get the chance to be mothered by her again at this
level of dependence. G.G. was persistent and kind. She never raised her
voice or criticized me. I was wounded and she understood that. She was
warm and loving and whether I "got it" or not didn't matter. We were
caught up in the process of recovery and every moment brought new
hope and new possibilities.

To celebrate, Mama and I would talk about my abilities. She was
superb at reminding me about what I could not accomplish yesterday and
how far I had come today. She had an eagle eye for understanding what I
could do and what obstacle was in my way for attaining the next level
toward my goal. We celebrated all my accomplishments. She helped me
clearly define what was next and helped me understand what I needed to
do to get there. She kept me on track by paying attention to my details. A
lot of stroke survivors complain that they are no longer recovering. I
often wonder if the real problem is that no one is paying attention to the
little accomplishments that are being made. If the boundary between
what you can do and what you cannot do is not clearly defined, then you
don't know what to try next. Recovery can be derailed by hopelessness.

I had a blow-up mattress that Mama filled with air and she built a
little bedroom for herself on the floor of my living room. She took care
of everything - the grocery list, the phone calls, even the bills. She was
considerate and let me sleep and sleep and sleep some more. Again, we
both trusted that my brain knew what it needed in order for it to mend
itself. As long as I was not sleeping due to depression, we respected the
healing power of sleep.

Once home, we let my brain set its own routine. I would sleep for
about six hours and then be awake for about 20 minutes. Generally, the
average length of time for a complete sleep cycle is 90-110 minutes. If I
was awakened prematurely by external forces, I had to go back to sleep
and start that cycle over. Otherwise, I would wake with a severe
headache, an irritable attitude, and not be able to either sort through
stimulation or focus my attention. To protect my sleep, I slept with
earplugs and G.G. turned the TV and phone down low.

After a few days of intense sleeping, my energy reservoirs enabled
me to remain awake for longer periods of time. Mama was a real
taskmaster, and there was no wasted time or energy. When I was awake,
I was a sponge for learning and she either put something in my hands for
me to do or exercised my body. Yet, when I was ready to sleep, we
honored that my brain had reached its maximum level of input and we
put it to bed so it could rest and integrate.

Exploring life and recovering files with G.G. was fabulous fun.
She learned quickly that there was no point in asking me Yes/No
questions if she really wanted to know what I was thinking. It was way
too easy for me to zone out about something that I didn't really care
about and just B.S. her. To make sure she had my attention and I was
actually working my mind, she asked me multiple-choice questions.
"For lunch," she would say, "you can have minestrone soup," and then I
would go on a search in my brain to figure out what minestrone soup
was. Once I understood what that option was, then she would proceed
with another choice. "Or, you can have a grilled cheese sandwich."
Again, I would explore my brain for what a grilled cheese sandwich
was. Once the image and understanding came to me, she went on. "Or,
you can have tuna salad." I remember pondering _Tuna, tuna, tuna_ and no
image or understanding came into my mind. So I queried, "Tuna?"
Mama countered, "Tuna fish from the ocean, a white meat mixed with
mayonnaise, onion, and celery." Since I could not find the file for tuna
salad, that's what we chose for lunch. That was our strategy if I couldn't
find the old file; we made it a point to make a new one.

The telephone rang all the time and G.G. was a real trooper at
keeping everyone abreast of our daily successes. It was important that
she had people to talk to about how well things were going, and it was
helpful to me to have her positive attitude cheering me on. Day after day
she shared stories that would remind me about how far we had come.

Occasionally friends came to visit, but G.G. recognized that social
exchange used up my energy reserve and left me totally drained and not
interested in working. She made the executive decision that getting my
mind back was more important than visitation, so she stood as the guard
at my door and strictly limited my social time. TV was also a terrible
energy drain, and I couldn't speak on the phone because I was
completely dependent on the visual cues of lip reading. We were both
respectful of what I needed to do, or not do, to recover.

Somehow we innately understood that I needed to heal my brain
and challenge my neurological systems as quickly as possible. Although
my neurons were stunned, technically very few of them had actually
died. I would not have any official speech, occupational or physical
therapy until a couple of weeks after my surgery and in the meantime,
my neurons were hungry to learn. Neurons either thrive when connected
in circuit with other neurons, or they die when they sit in isolation
without stimulation. G.G. and I were both highly motivated to get my
brain back, so we took advantage of every moment and every precious
ounce of energy.

My friend Steve had two little girls, so he brought me a collection
of their books and toys. Included in the bag were children's puzzles and
games. G.G. was now armed with a repertoire of age-appropriate things
for me to do, and it was her policy that if I was awake and had any
energy at all, she worked me.

My energy reserve did not discriminate between cognitive versus
physical activity. Energy use was energy use so we had to create a
balanced strategy for recovering everything. As soon as I was able to
walk around my apartment with some assistance, G.G. took me on a tour
of my life. We began in the art space as I had an entire room set up for
cutting stained glass. As I looked around the room, I was amazed. All of
this gloriously beautiful glass! How delightful! I was an artist. And then
she took me into my music room. When I strummed the strings on my
guitar and then my cello, I marveled at the magic in my life. I wanted to
recover.

Opening old files in my mind was a delicate process. I wondered
what it would take to recall all those filing cabinets lining my brain,
which contained the details of my previous life. I knew that I knew all of
this stuff; I just had to figure out how to access the information again. It
had been over a week since my brain had experienced the severe trauma
of the hemorrhage, but the cells in my brain were still not capable of
functioning correctly because of the golf ball-sized blood clot. From my
perspective, I felt that every present moment was rich with experience
and existed in absolute isolation. Once my back was turned, however, I
was in a new rich moment and the details of the past lingered in an
image or a feeling but quickly disappeared.

One morning, G.G. decided I was ready to tackle a children's
puzzle so she put the puzzle box into my hands and had me look at the
picture on the cover. She then helped me open the box by pulling up the
lid and placed a little tray on my lap so I could dump out all the pieces.
My fingers were weak and my dexterity poor, so this task would be an
excellent challenge. I was very good at monkey-see, monkey-do.

G.G. explained to me that these pieces of the puzzle would fit
together to create the whole picture on the box cover. She directed me to
turn all of the pieces right side up. I asked her, "What is right side up?"
and she took a piece of the puzzle and showed me how to distinguish
between the front and back. Once I understood the difference, I spent a
little time inspecting every piece of the puzzle and eventually all 12
pieces of the puzzle were right side up. Wowie! What a sense of
accomplishment! Just performing that simple mental and physical task
was extremely difficult, and although I felt exhausted to have endured
that level of concentration and focus, I was excited and eager to
continue.

For the next task G.G. said, "Now pick out all the pieces that have
an edge." I asked, "What's an edge?" Again, she patiently picked up a
couple of pieces with an edge and showed me the straight cut. I then
proceeded to separate out all of the edges. And once again, I felt totally
accomplished and mentally fatigued.

G.G. then said to me, "I want you to take these 'outsy' pieces and
hook them together with these 'insy' pieces. Also, notice that some of
these insy and outsy pieces are different sizes." My right hand was
extremely weak so just holding the pieces and making comparisons took
a lot of effort. Mama watched me very closely and realized that I was
trying to fit pieces together that obviously did not belong together based
upon the image on their front side. In an effort to help me, G.G. noted,
"Jill, you can use color as a clue." I thought to myself _color, color,_ and
like a light bulb going off in my head, I could suddenly see color! I
thought, _Oh my goodness, that would certainly make it much easier!_ I
was so worn out that I had to go to sleep. But the next day, I went
straight back to the puzzle and put all the pieces together using color as a
clue. Every day we rejoiced what I could do that I could not do the day
before.

It still blows my mind (so to speak) that I could not see color until
I was told that color was a tool I could use. Who would have guessed
that my left hemisphere needed to be told about color in order for it to
register? I found the same to be true for seeing in three dimensions. G.G.
had to teach me that I could see things in different planes. She pointed
out to me how some objects were closer or farther away, and that some
things could be positioned in front of others. I had to be taught that
items, which are positioned behind other items, may have some of their
parts hidden, and that I could make assumptions about the shapes of
things that I could not see in their entirety.

By the end of my first week at home, I was ambulating around my
apartment pretty well and was highly motivated to find ways to exercise
my body to make it stronger. One of my favorite chores, even before the
stroke, was washing dishes. However, in this condition, it proved to be
one of my greatest teachers. Balancing myself in front of the sink and
handling delicate plates and dangerous knives was pretty challenging in
and of itself, but who would guess that organizing a clean dish rack
required the ability to calculate? As it turns out, the only neurons in my
brain that actually died on the morning of the stroke were the ones
capable of understanding mathematics. (How ironic it was that my
mother had spent her entire life teaching mathematics!) I could handle
washing dishes, but calculating how to get all those clean dishes to fit in
that tiny little rack, well, that totally dumbfounded me! It took almost a
year for me to figure it out.

I loved collecting the mail from my front box. Every day for six
weeks, I received 5-15 cards from people who were cheering me on.
Although I could not read what they wrote, I would sit on G.G.'s
mattress and look at the pictures, touch the cards and literally feel the
love radiating from every message. G.G. would read the cards to me
every afternoon. We hung them up all over the apartment so I was
surrounded by all this love - on the doors, on the walls, in the bathroom,
everywhere! It was really wonderful to receive these cards with the
fundamental message being something like, "Dr. Jill, you don't know
who I am, but I met you when you keynoted in Phoenix. Please come
back to us. We love you and your work is so important to us." Every day
I received this touching reinforcement of who I had been before the
stroke. There is no question in my mind that it was the power of this
unconditional support and love that gave me the courage to face the
challenges of recovery. I will always be grateful for my friends and
NAMI family who reached out to me and believed in me.

Learning to read again was by far the hardest thing I had to do. I
don't know if those cells in my brain had died or what, but I had no
recollection that reading was something I had ever done before, and I
thought the concept was ridiculous. Reading was such an abstract idea
that I couldn't believe anyone had ever thought of it, much less put forth
the effort to figure out how to do it. Although G.G. was a kind
taskmaster, she was insistent about my learning and placed a book titled
_The Puppy Who Wanted a Boy_ in my hands. Together we embarked upon
the most arduous task I could imagine: teaching me to make sense of the
written word. It befuddled me how she could think these squiggles were
significant. I remember her showing me an "S" and saying, "This is an
'S,'" and I would say, "No Mama, that's a squiggle." And she would say,
"This squiggle is an 'S' and it sounds like 'SSSSSS'." I thought the
woman had lost her mind. A squiggle was just a squiggle and it made no
sound.

My brain remained in pain over the task of learning to read for
quite some time. I had a real problem concentrating on something that
complicated. Thinking literally was hard enough for my brain at this
early stage, but jumping to something abstract was beyond me. Learning
to read took a long time and a lot of coaxing. First, I had to understand
that every squiggle had a name, and that every squiggle had an
associated sound. Then, combinations of squiggles - er -letters, fit
together to represent special combinations of sounds (sh, th, sq, etc).
When we string all of those combinations of sounds together, they make
a single sound (word) that has a meaning attached to it! Geez! Have you
ever stopped to think about how many tiny little tasks your brain is
performing this instant just so you can read this book?

Although I struggled and struggled with learning how to read
again, my brain showed obvious progress each day. We celebrated when
I could finally read the sounds (words) out loud, even though I displayed
no comprehension. As the days went by, my recall about the overall
content of the story improved and G.G. and I were both motivated to
keep plodding along.

The next step, of course, was to associate a meaning to the sound.
This was particularly difficult since I was already having a hard time
recalling my verbal vocabulary. The blood clot was pushing against the
fibers running between my two language centers, so neither of them was
working properly. Broca's area in the front of my brain was having
problems creating sounds while Wernicke's in the back of my brain was
confusing my nouns. There seemed to be a serious gap in my
information processing and often I could not articulate what I was
thinking. Although I would think that I wanted a glass of water, and
picture a glass of water in my mind, the word "milk" would still come
out of my mouth. Although it was helpful for people to correct me, it
was vitally important that no one either finish my sentences or constantly
prompt me. If I were to ever regain these abilities, then I needed to find
that circuitry within my mind, in my own time, and exercise it.

Day by day, I became stronger and more capable of physical
exertion. The first time G.G. took me out into the yard was a fascinating
learning experience. As I stood on the front walk, I needed to be taught
that the lines in the cement on the sidewalk were not significant and that
it was okay for me to step on those. I needed to be told that, because
otherwise I didn't know. Then I needed to be taught that the line on the
edge of the sidewalk was important because there was a dip there into
the grass and if I was not careful, I could twist my ankle. Again, I didn't
know that and I needed to be told. And then there was the grass. I needed
to be shown that the texture of the grass was different from the texture of
the pavement and that sinking down into the grass was okay

- I just needed to pay attention and adjust my balance. G.G.
let me feel what it was like to walk on snow, and she held me while my
foot slipped on ice. If she was going to exercise me outside, I had to
relearn that each of these textures had different features, characteristics,
and their unique hazards. She kept reminding me, "What's the first thing
a baby does with anything you give it?" The answer, of course, is that it
puts it in its mouth to feel it. G.G. knew I needed to have direct physical
contact with the world to learn kinesthetically. She was a brilliant
teacher.

The upcoming surgery was going to be a huge hit to my energy,
and I was committed to being physically capable of enduring it. I felt
that I had lost my "brightness" when the hemorrhage occurred, and my
body felt dull and weary. It seemed as if there were a veil separating me
from the world outside. Dr. Young assured us that surgically removing
the blood clot from my brain could potentially shift my perception and I
might feel "bright" again. I figured that if I could get the brightness of
my spirit back, then it didn't really matter how much I recovered, and I
could be happy with whatever came my way.

My apartment was located on a busy street in Winchester,
Massachusetts and my backyard abutted a complex of apartments for the
elderly. The driveway through the complex made a loop and G.G. would
walk me around this natural track for exercise. I couldn't make it far in
the early days, but with perseverance we eventually made it all the way
around the loop. Sometimes we would loop twice if the weather
permitted.

On the really cold days and the days of fresh snow, G.G. took me
to the local grocery store for my daily exercise. She would go in and do
her shopping and I would start walking up and down the aisles. This was
a painful environment for me for several reasons. First, the intensity of
the fluorescent lights was so powerful I had to constantly look down.
G.G. encouraged me to wear sunglasses to block out the glare but this
did little for the overpowering enormity of the room. Second, there was
so much written information coming at me from all of the food items
that I felt totally bombarded with stimuli. Third, the exposure to
strangers was difficult for me emotionally. It was easy for others to see
that I was a woman with some sort of problem. My face had that glazed
over look, and my movements were very deliberate and in slow motion
when compared to the normal shopper. Many people rushed their baskets
past me. Some even snarled and grumbled at me with what I interpreted
as contempt. It was hard to shield myself from the negative vibrations in
the environment. Occasionally, a kind spirit offered me assistance or a
smile. I found facing the busy world to be intimidating and frightening.

I was introduced to the mechanics of everyday life by
accompanying G.G. when she needed to do things. I became her baby
duck in training, and when I had enough energy, I followed her
everywhere. Who would guess that a trip to the laundromat was
excellent rehabilitation? After spending time in my apartment separating
the light colored clothing from the darks, we bagged them with care.
Upon arrival at the laundromat, we dumped the bags into the washers.
G.G. put a quarter into my hand and then a nickel and dime. I didn't
know anything about money so this was her chance to teach me. Again,
the cells in my brain that understood mathematics were no longer
functioning, and my attempt to deal with something so abstract as
money was pitiful. When G.G. queried, "What's one plus one?" I paused
for a moment, explored the contents of my mind and responded, "What's
a one?" I didn't understand numbers, much less money. It felt as though I
was in a foreign country with a currency I didn't understand.

Repeatedly, G.G. and I engaged in monkey-see, monkey-do
behavior. The washers all ended their cycle so close to one another that I
suddenly went from having nothing to do to having an overwhelming
quantity to do. First we had to empty the washers. Then before loading
the dryers we had to separate out the heavier items from the lighter ones.
G.G. explained our strategy to me along the way. With my energy level,
the washers were bearable, but frankly, the grand finale of the dryers
was more demanding than I could cognitively manage! It was
impossible for me to perform the "dryer dance" of pulling dry items out
along the way and slamming the door closed quickly enough to keep the
dryer spinning. I felt confused and desperate and wanted to crawl in a
hole, hide my head, and lick my wounds. Who knew that laundry could
evoke such panic in someone?

Christmas was rapidly approaching and G.G. invited my friend,
Kelly, to spend the holiday with us. Together, the three of us decorated
my apartment. On Christmas Eve, we found a small Christmas tree and
on Christmas Day we celebrated by going out to dinner at the local
Denny's. It was the simplest yet richest Christmas G.G. and I ever spent
together. I was alive and recovering, and that was all that mattered.

Christmas was a day for rejoicing, but in two days I would walk
into Massachusetts General Hospital to have my head cut open. From
my perspective, there were two things I still needed to accomplish before
surgery. One was mental and the other physical. My language was
slowly coming back and it was important to me that I thank the hundreds
of people who had sent me cards, letters, and flowers. I felt an intense
desire to let them know I was okay, thank them for their love, and rally
their continued prayers for what would come next. Folks from all over
the country had signed me up for prayer lists and prayer circles ranging
from local churches to the Pope's list. I felt incredible love coming my
way and I wanted to share my gratitude while I still had some linguistic
ability.

The greatest threat surgery posed was not only the loss of the
language I had recovered, but also the loss of all future ability to ever
become linguistically fluent. Since the golf ball-sized blood clot abutted
the fibers running between the two language centers in my left
hemisphere, it was possible that language might be excised during the
surgical process. If the surgeons had to remove some of my healthy brain
tissue while resecting the AVM, the consequence could be permanent
loss of speech. I had come so far in my recovery that the mere possibility
of this setback was chilling, but in my heart I knew that whatever the
outcome, language or no language, I would still be me and we would
begin again.

Although I failed miserably at reading and writing with a pen (left
hemisphere/right hand), I could sit at my computer and type a simple
letter (both hemispheres/both hands) that followed my stream of thought.
It took me a very long time as I hunt-and-pecked at the keyboard, but
somehow my body/mind connection made it happen. The most
interesting thing about this experience was that after I finished typing the
letter, I was not capable of reading what I had just written (left
hemisphere)! G.G. edited the letter and sent it out the night following my
surgery, along with a handwritten note. Since my recovery, I have heard
of many stroke survivors who, although they could not speak (left
hemisphere), they were capable of singing their messages (both
hemispheres). I'm amazed at the resiliency and resourcefulness of this
beautiful brain to find a way to communicate!

I worked day-in and day-out to get my body strong enough to
endure the very calculated hit of surgery. Yet, there was one more task I
wanted to achieve before my head met the saw. Five minutes up the
street from my apartment was the Fellsway, a magnificent wooded
acreage encompassing a couple of small mountain-like lakes. The
Fellsway had been a magic-land for me. Most days after work, I
unwound by wandering the trails among the pines, and rarely did I see
another soul. I would sing and dance and prance and pray there. For me,
it was a sacred place where I could commune with nature and rejuvenate.

I desperately wanted to climb that steep slippery hill up into the
Fellsway before surgery. I ached to stand on top of the gigantic boulders,
spread my arms in the breeze and feel the replenishment of my life-force
power. On the day before surgery, with Kelly by my side, I slowly
climbed the hill and made my dream come true. There atop the boulders
overlooking the lights of Boston, I rocked in the breeze and breathed in
long, strong, empowering breaths. No matter what the next day's surgery
held, this body of mine was the life force power of trillions of healthy
cells. For the first time since the stroke, I felt my body was strong
enough to endure the upcoming craniotomy.
