# 20. Tending the Garden

I have learned so much from this experience with stroke, that I
actually feel fortunate to have taken this journey. Thanks to this trauma, I
have had the chance to witness firsthand a few things about my brain
that otherwise I would never have imagined to be true. For these simple
insights, I will always be grateful - not just for myself but for the hope
these possibilities may bring to how we, as a people, choose to view and
nurture our brains and consequently behave on this planet.

I am grateful for your willingness to join me on this intense
journey. I sincerely hope that whatever circumstances brought you to this
book, you move forward having gleaned some insight into your brain or
the brain of another. I trust with my right hemisphere's heart
consciousness that this book will now flow from your hands into the
hands of someone who may benefit from it.

I always end my e-mails with a tag-line quote from Einstein. I
believe he got it right when he said, "I must be willing to give up what I
am in order to become what I will be." I learned the hard way that my
ability to be in the world is completely dependent on the integrity of my
neurocircuitry. Cell by beautiful cell, circuit by neurocircuit, the
consciousness I experience within my brain is the
collective awareness established by those marvelous little entities as they
weave together the web I call my mind. Thanks to their neural plasticity,
their ability to shift and change their connections with other cells, you
and I walk the earth with the ability to be flexible in our thinking,
adaptable to our environment, and capable of choosing who and how we
want to be in the world. Fortunately, how we choose to be today is not
predetermined by how we were yesterday.

I view the garden in my mind as a sacred patch of cosmic real
estate that the universe has entrusted me to tend over the years of my
lifetime. As an independent agent, I and I alone, in conjunction with the
molecular genius of my DNA and the environmental factors I am
exposed to, will decorate this space within my cranium. In the early
years, I may have minimal input into what circuits grow inside my brain
because I am the product of the dirt and seeds I have inherited. But to
our good fortune, the genius of our DNA is not a dictator, and thanks to
our neurons' plasticity, the power of thought, and the wonders of modern
medicine, very few outcomes are absolute.

Regardless of the garden I have inherited, once I consciously take
over the responsibility of tending my mind, I choose to nurture those
circuits that I want to grow, and consciously prune back those circuits I
prefer to live without. Although it is easier for me to nip a weed when it
is just a sprouting bud, with determination and perseverance, even the
gnarliest of vines, when deprived of fuel, will eventually lose its strength
and fall to the side.

The mental health of our society is established by the mental
health of the brains making up our society, and I must admit that western
civilization is a pretty challenging environment for my loving and
peaceful right hemisphere character to live in. Obviously, I'm not alone
in feeling this way, as I look at the millions of beautiful people in our
society who have chosen to escape our common reality by selfmedicating themselves with illicit drugs and alcohol.

I think Ghandi was right when he said, "We must be the change we
want to see in the world." I find that my right hemisphere consciousness
is eager for us to take that next giant leap for mankind and _step to the right_ so we can evolve this planet into the peaceful and loving place we
yearn for it to be.

Your body is the life force power of some fifty trillion molecular
geniuses. You and you alone choose moment by moment who and how
you want to be in the world. I encourage you to pay attention to what is
going on in your brain. Own your power and show up for your life.
Beam bright!

And when your life force wanes, I hope you will give the gift of
hope and donate your beautiful brain to Harvard.
