# 3. Hemispheres Asymmetries

Scientists have been studying the functional asymmetries of the
human cerebral cortices for over 200 years. To my knowledge, the
first person on record to suggest that each hemisphere actually had its
own mind was Meinard Simon Du Pui. In 1780, Du Pui claimed that
mankind was _Homo Duplex_ - meaning that he had a double brain with
a double mind. [10] Nearly a century later, in the late 1800s, Arthur
Ladbroke Wigan witnessed the autopsy of a man who could walk,
talk, read, write, and function like a normal man. Upon examination
of his brain, however, Wigan discovered that this man had only one
cerebral hemisphere. Wigan concluded that since this man, who had
only "half" a brain, had a whole mind and could function like a whole
man, then those of us who have two hemispheres must have two
minds. Wigan enthusiastically championed this "Duality of the Mind"
theory. [11]

Over the centuries, various conclusions have been drawn about
the differences and similarities in how the two hemispheres process
information and learn new material. This subject gained tremendous
popularity in the United States in the 1970s, following a series of
split-brain experiments where Dr. Roger W. Sperry surgically cut the
fibers of the corpus callosum of people experiencing severe epileptic
seizures. In his 1981 Nobel lecture, Sperry commented:

Under the conditions of commissurotomy where background
factors are equalized and where close left-right comparisons
become possible within the same subject working the same
problem, even slight lateral differences become significant.
The same individual can be observed to employ consistently
one or the other of two distinct forms of mental approach and
strategy, much like two different people, depending on whether
the left or right hemisphere is in use. [1]

Since those early studies of split-brain patients, neuroscientists
have learned that the two hemispheres perform differently when they are
connected to one another than when they are surgically separated. [2] When
normally connected, the two hemispheres complement and enhance one
another's abilities. When surgically separated, the two hemispheres
function as two independent brains with unique personalities, often
described as the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde phenomenon.

Using noninvasive modern techniques including functional
imaging (fMRI), scientists are now capable of visualizing which specific
neurons are engaged in performing a designated function in real time.
Because our two hemispheres are so neuronally integrated via the corpus
callosum, virtually every cognitive behavior we exhibit involves activity
in both hemispheres - they simply do it differently. As a result, the world
of science supports the idea that the relationship between the two
cerebral hemispheres is more appropriately viewed as two
complementary halves of a whole rather than as two individual entities
or identities.

It makes sense that having two cerebral hemispheres that process
information in uniquely different ways would increase our brain's
capacity to experience the world around us and increase our chances of
survival as a species. Because our two hemispheres are so adept at
weaving together a single seamless perception of the world, it is
virtually impossible for us to consciously distinguish between what is
going on in our left hemisphere versus our right hemisphere.

To begin, it is important to understand that hemispheric dominance
is not to be confused with hand dominance. Dominance in the brain is
determined by which hemisphere houses the ability to create and
understand verbal language. Although the statistics vary depending upon
whom you ask, virtually everyone who is right handed (over 85% of the
U.S. population) is left hemisphere dominant. At the same time, over
60% of left handed people are also classified as left hemisphere
dominant. Let's take a closer look at the asymmetries of the two
hemispheres.

Our right hemisphere (which controls the left half of our body)
functions like a parallel processor. Independent streams of information
simultaneously burst into our brain via each of our sensory systems.
Moment by moment, our right mind creates a master collage of what this
moment in time looks like, sounds like, tastes like, smells like, and feels
like. Moments don't come and go in a rush, but rather are rich with
sensations, thoughts, emotions, and often, physiological responses.
Information processed in this way allows us to take an immediate
inventory about the space around us and our relationship to that space.

Thanks to the skills of our right mind, we are capable of
remembering isolated moments with uncanny clarity and accuracy. Most
of us can remember where we were and how we felt when we first heard
about the assassination of President Kennedy or saw the collapse of the
World Trade Center. Do you remember the moment you spoke the words
"I do," or first saw your newborn smile? Our right hemisphere is
designed to remember things as they relate to one another. Borders
between specific entities are softened, and complex mental collages can
be recalled in their entirety as combinations of images, kinesthetics, and
physiology.

To the right mind, no time exists other than the present moment,
and each moment is vibrant with sensation. Life or death occurs in the
present moment. The experience of joy happens in the present moment.
Our perception and experience of connection with something that is
greater than ourselves occurs in the present moment. To our right mind,
the moment of _now_ is timeless and abundant.

In the absence of all the rules and regulations that have already
been defined as the correct way of doing something, our right mind is
free to think intuitively outside the box, and it creatively explores the
possibilities that each new moment brings. By its design, our right mind
is spontaneous, carefree, and imaginative. It allows our artistic juices to
flow free without inhibition or judgment.

The present moment is a time when everything and everyone are
_one_ connected together as . As a result, our right mind perceives each of
us as equal members of the human family. It identifies our similarities
and recognizes our relationship with this marvelous planet, which
sustains our life. It perceives the big picture, how everything is related,
and how we all join together to make up the whole. Our ability to be
empathic, to walk in the shoes of another and feel their feelings, is a
product of our right frontal cortex.

In contrast, our left hemisphere is completely different in the way
it processes information. It takes each of those rich and complex
moments created by the right hemisphere and strings them together in
timely succession. It then sequentially compares the details making up
this moment with the details making up the last moment. By organizing
details in a linear and methodical configuration, our left brain manifests
the concept of time whereby our moments are divided into the past,
present, and future. Within the structure of this predictable temporal
cadence, we can appreciate that this must occur before that can happen. I
look at my shoes and socks and it is my left hemisphere that
comprehends that I must put my socks on before my shoes. It can look at
all the details of a puzzle and use the clues of color, shape, and size to
recognize patterns for arrangement. It builds an understanding of
everything using deductive reasoning such that if A is greater than B,
and B is greater than C, then A must be greater than C.

Just opposite to how our right hemisphere thinks in pictures and
perceives the big picture of the present moment, our left mind thrives on
details, details, and more details about those details. Our left hemisphere
language centers use words to describe, define, categorize, and
communicate about everything. They break the big picture perception of
the present moment into manageable and comparable bits of data that
they can talk about. Our left hemisphere looks at a flower and names the
different parts making up the whole -the petal, stem, stamen, and pollen.
It dissects the image of a rainbow into the language of red, orange,
yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. It describes our body as arms,
legs, a torso, and every anatomical, physiological, and biochemical
detail one can imagine. It thrives on weaving facts and details into a
story. It excels in academics, and by doing so, it
manifests a sense of authority over the details it masters.

Via our left hemisphere language centers, our mind speaks to us
constantly, a phenomenon I refer to as "brain chatter." It is that voice
reminding you to pick up bananas on your way home and that
calculating intelligence that knows when you have to do your laundry.
There is vast individual variation in the speed at which our minds
function. For some, our dialogue of brain chatter runs so fast that we can
barely keep up with what we are thinking. Others of us think in language
so slowly that it takes a long time for us to comprehend. Still others of
us have a problem retaining our focus and concentration long enough to
act on our thoughts. These variations in normal processing stem back to
our brain cells and how each brain is intrinsically wired.

One of the jobs of our left hemisphere language centers is to
define our _self_ by saying "I am." Through the use of brain chatter, your
brain repeats over and over again the details of your life so you can
remember them. It is the home of your ego center, which provides you
with an internal awareness of what your name is, what your credentials
are, and where you live. Without these cells performing their job, you
would forget who you are and lose track of your life and your identity.

Along with thinking in language, our left hemisphere thinks in
patterned responses to incoming stimulation. It establishes neurological
circuits that run relatively automatically to sensory information. These
circuits allow us to process large volumes of information without having
to spend much time focusing on the individual bits of data. From a
neurological standpoint, every time a circuit of neurons is stimulated, it
takes less external stimulation for that particular circuit to run. As a
result of this type of reverberating circuitry, our left hemisphere creates
what I call "loops of thought patterns" that it uses to rapidly interpret
large volumes of incoming stimulation with minimal attention and
calculation.

Because our left brain is filled with these ingrained programs of
pattern recognition, it is superb at predicting what we will think, how we
will act, or what we will feel in the future - based upon our past
experience. I, personally, love the color red and am inclined to collect a
bunch of red things - I drive a red car and wear red clothes. I like red
because there's a circuit in my brain that gets very excited and runs
relatively automatically when anything red comes my way. From a
purely neurological perspective, I like red because the cells in my left
brain tell me I like red.

Among other things, our left hemisphere categorizes information
into hierarchies including things that attract us (our likes) or repel us
(our dislikes). It places the judgment of good on those things we like and
bad on those things we dislike. Through the action of critical judgment
and analysis, our left brain constantly compares us with everyone else. It
keeps us abreast of where we stand on the financial scale, academic
scale, honesty scale, generosity-of-spirit scale, and every other scale you
can imagine. Our ego mind revels in our individuality, honors our
uniqueness, and strives for independence.

Although each of our cerebral hemispheres process information in
uniquely different ways, the two work intimately with one another when
it comes to just about every action we undertake. With language, for
example, our left hemisphere understands the details making up the
structure and semantics of the sentence - and the meaning of the words.
It is our left mind that understands what letters are and how they fit
together to create a sound (word) that has a concept (meaning) attached
to it. It then strings words together in a linear fashion to create sentences
and paragraphs capable of conveying very complex messages.

Our right hemisphere complements the action of our left
hemisphere language centers by interpreting non-verbal communication.

Our right mind evaluates the more subtle cues of language including
tone of voice, facial expression, and body language. Our right
hemisphere looks at the big picture of communication and assesses the
congruity of the overall expression. Any inconsistencies between how
someone holds their body, versus their facial expression, versus their
tone of voice, versus the message they are communicating, might
indicate either a neurological abnormality in how someone expresses
himself or it may prove to be a telltale sign that the person is not telling
the truth.

People who have damage in their left hemisphere often cannot
create or understand speech because the cells in their language centers
have been injured. However, they are often genius at being able to
determine if someone is telling the truth, thanks to the cells in their right
hemisphere. On the other hand, if someone has damage to their right
hemisphere, they may not appropriately assess the emotional content of
a message. For example, if I am playing blackjack at a party and I say,
"hit me!" a person with a damaged right hemisphere may think I am
asking him to physically strike me rather than understand that I am
simply asking for another card. Without the right hemisphere's ability to
evaluate communication in the context of the bigger picture, the left
hemisphere tends to interpret everything literally.

Music is another great example of how our two hemispheres
complement one another in function. When we methodically and
meticulously drill our scales over and over again, when we learn to read
the language of staff notation, and when we memorize which fingering
on an instrument will create which named note, we are tapping primarily
into the skills of our left brain. Our right brain kicks into high gear when
we are doing things in the present moment - like performing,
improvising or playing by ear.

Did you ever stop to consider how it is that your brain knows how
to define the dimensions of your body in space?

Amazingly, there are cells in our left hemisphere's orientation
association area that define the boundaries of our body -where we begin
and where we end relative to the space around us. At the same time,
there are cells in our right hemisphere's orientation association area that
orient our body in space. As a result, our left hemisphere teaches us
where our body begins and ends, and our right hemisphere helps us place
it where we want it to go. [3]

I enthusiastically encourage you to explore the myriad of current
literature about teaching and the brain, learning and the brain, and the
asymmetries of our two cortical hemispheres. I believe that the more we
understand about how our hemispheres work together to create our
perception of reality, then the more successful we will be in
understanding the natural gifts of our own brains, as well as more
effectively help people recover from neurological trauma.

The type of stroke I experienced was a severe hemorrhage in the
left hemisphere of my brain due to an undiagnosed AVM. On the
morning of the stroke, this massive hemorrhage rendered me so
completely disabled that I describe myself as an infant in a woman's
body. Two and a half weeks after the stroke, I underwent major surgery
to remove a golf ball-sized blood clot that was obstructing my brain's
ability to transmit information.

Following surgery, it took eight years for me to completely recover
all physical and mental functions. I believe I have recovered completely
because I had an advantage. As a trained neuroanatomist, I believed in
the plasticity of my brain - its ability to repair, replace, and retrain its
neural circuitry. In addition, thanks to my academics, I had a "roadmap"
to understanding how my brain cells needed to be treated in order for
them to recover.

The story that follows is my stroke of insight into the beauty and
resiliency of the human brain. It's a personal account, as seen through the
eyes of a neuroscientist, about what it felt like to experience the
deterioration of my left brain and then recover it. It is my hope that this
book will offer insight into how the brain works in both wellness and in
illness. Although this book is written for the general public, I hope you

will share it with people you want to help recover from brain trauma and
their caregivers.
