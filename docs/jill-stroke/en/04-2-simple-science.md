# 2. Simple Science

For any two of us to communicate with one another, we must
share a certain amount of common reality. As a result, our nervous
systems must be virtually identical in their ability to perceive
information from the external world, process and integrate that
information in our brains, and then have similar systems of output
including thought, word, or deed.

The emergence of life was a most remarkable event. With the
advent of the single-celled organism, a new era of information
processing was born at the molecular level. Through the manipulation
of atoms and molecules into DNA and RNA sequences, information
could be entered, coded, and stored for future use. Moments in time no
longer came and went without a record and, by interweaving a
continuum of sequential moments into a common thread, the life of the
cell evolved as _a bridge across time_ . Before long, cells figured out ways
of hanging together and working together, which finally produced you
and me.

According to the _American Heritage Dictionary,_ to evolve
biologically means "to develop by evolutionary processes from a
primitive to a more highly organized form. ~~"~~ [1]

Earth's molecular brain of DNA is a powerful and successful genetic
program - not only because it adapts to constant change, but also
because it expects, appreciates, and takes advantage of opportunities to
transform itself into something even more magnificent. It is perhaps of
interest that our human genetic code is constructed by the exact same
four nucleotides (complex molecules) as every other form of life on the
planet. At the level of our DNA, we are related to the birds, reptiles,
amphibians, other mammals, and even the plant life. From a purely
biological perspective, we human beings are our own species-specific
mutation of earth's genetic possibility.

As much as we would like to think that human life has attained
biological perfection, despite our sophisticated design, we do not
represent a finished and/ or perfect genetic code. The human brain exists
in an ongoing state of change. Even the brains of our ancestors of 2000
or 4000 years ago do not look identical to the brains of man today. The
development of language, for example, has altered our brains'
anatomical structure and cellular networks.

Most of the different types of cells in our body die and are
replaced every few weeks or months. However, neurons, the primary
cell of the nervous system, do not multiply (for the most part) after we
are born. That means that the majority of the neurons in your brain today
are as old as you are. This longevity of the neurons partially accounts for
why we feel pretty much the same on the inside at the age of 10 as we do
at age 30 or 77. The cells in our brain are the same but over time their
connections change based upon their/our experience.

The human nervous system is a wonderfully dynamic entity
composed of an estimated one trillion cells. To give you some
appreciation for how enormous one trillion is, consider this: there are
approximately six billion people on the planet and we would have to
multiply all six billion people 166 times just to make up the number of
cells
combining to create a single nervous system!

Of course, our body is much more than a nervous system. In fact,
the typical adult human body is composed of approximately fifty trillion
cells. That would be 8,333 times all of the six billion people on the
planet! What's amazing is that this huge conglomeration of bone cells,
muscle cells, connective tissue cells, sensory cells, etc. tend to get along
and work together to generate perfect health.

Biological evolution generally occurs from a state of lesser
complexity to a state of greater complexity. Nature ensures her own
efficiency by not reinventing the wheel with every new species she
creates. Generally, once nature identifies a pattern in the genetic code
that works toward the survival of the creature, like a blossom for nectar
transmission, a heart to pump blood, a sweat gland to help regulate body
temperature or an eyeball for vision, she tends to build that feature into
future permutations of that specific code. By adding a new level of
programming on top of an already well-established set of instructions,
each new species contains a strong foundation of time-tested DNA
sequences. This is one of the simple ways through which nature
transmits the experience and wisdom bestowed by ancient life to her
progeny.

Another advantage to this type of build-on-top-of-what-alreadyworks genetic engineering strategy is that very small manipulations of
the genetic sequences can result in major evolutionary transformations.
In our own genetic profile, believe it or not, scientific evidence indicates
that we humans share 99.4% of our total DNA sequences with the
chimpanzee. [2]

This does not mean, of course, that humans are direct descendants
from our tree-swinging friends, but it does emphasize that the genius of
our molecular code is supported by eons of nature's greatest evolutionary
effort. Our human code was not a random act, at least not in its entirety,
but rather is better construed as nature's ever-evolving quest for a body
of genetic perfection.

As members of the same human species, you and I share all but
0.01% (1/100th of 1%) of identical genetic sequences. So biologically, as
a species, you and I are virtually identical to one another at the level of
our genes (99.99%). Looking around at the diversity within our human
race, it is obvious that 0.01% accounts for a significant difference in how
we look, think, and behave.

The portion of our brain that separates us from all other mammals
is the outer undulated and convoluted cerebral cortex. Although other
mammals do have a cerebral cortex, the human cortex has approximately
twice the thickness and is believed to have twice the function. Our
cerebral cortex is divided into two major hemispheres, which
complement one another in function. (Note: All of the pictures in this
book have the front of the brain directed to the left).

![whole human brain berebral cortext](/jill-stroke/img210.jpg)

>(front of brain): Nằm ở phía bên trái của hình ảnh, chỉ mặt trước của não.
>(back of brain): Nằm ở phía bên phải của hình ảnh, chỉ mặt sau của não.


The two hemispheres communicate with one another through the highway
for information transfer, the corpus callosum. Although each hemisphere is
unique in the specific
types of information it processes, when the two hemispheres are
connected to one another, they work together to generate a single
seamless perception of the world.

When it comes to the intricate microscopic anatomy of how our
cerebral cortices are finely wired, variation is the rule, not the exception.
This variation contributes to our individual preferences and
personalities. However, the gross (or macroscopic) anatomy of our
brains is quite consistent and your brain looks very similar to mine. The
bumps (gyri) and grooves (sulci) of the cerebral cortex are specifically
organized such that our brains are virtually identical in appearance,
structure, and function. For example, each of our cerebral hemispheres
contain a superior temporal gyrus, pre-and postcentral gyri, a superior
parietal gyrus, along with a lateral occipital gyrus - just to mention a
few. Each of these gyri are made up of very specific groups of cells that
have very specific connections and functions.

For instance, the cells of the postcentral gyrus enable us to be
consciously aware of sensory stimulation, while the cells in the
precentral gyrus control our ability to voluntarily move our body parts.
The major pathways for information transfer between the various
cortical groups of cells (fiber tracts) within each of the two hemispheres
are also consistent between us and, as a result, we are generally capable
of thinking and feeling in comparable ways.

>Lateral Occipital Gyrus (vision): Vùng não được đánh dấu bằng họa tiết các đốm lớn nhỏ, có chức năng thị giác.\
>Superior Temporal Gyrus (hearing and speech): Vùng não được đánh dấu bằng họa tiết hạt, có chức năng nghe và nói.

The blood vessels supplying nutrients to our cerebral
hemispheres also display a defined pattern. The anterior,
middle, and posterior cerebral arteries supply blood to each
of the two hemispheres. Damage to any specific branch of
one of these major arteries may result in somewhat
predictable symptoms of severe impairment or complete
elimination of our ability to perform specific cognitive
functions. (Of course there are unique differences between
damage to the right and left hemispheres.) The following
illustration shows the territory of the middle cerebral artery
of the left hemisphere, and this includes the location of my
stroke. Damage to any of the middle cerebral artery's
primary branches would result in relatively predictable
symptoms no matter who was having the problem.

The superficial layers of the cortex, which we see when we look at the external
surface of the brain, are filled
with neurons that we believe to be uniquely human. These
most recently "added on" neurons create circuits that
manufacture our ability to think linearly - as in complex
language and the ability to think in abstract, symbolic
systems like mathematics. The deeper layers of the
cerebral cortex make up the cells of the limbic system.
These are the cortical cells we share with other mammals.

The limbic system functions by placing an affect, or
emotion, on information streaming in through our senses.
Because we share these structures with other creatures, the
limbic system cells are often referred to as the "reptilian
brain" or the "emotional brain." When we are newborns,
these cells become wired together in response to sensory
stimulation. It is interesting to note that although our
limbic system functions throughout our lifetime, it does
not mature. As a result, when our emotional "buttons" are
pushed, we retain the ability to react to incoming
stimulation as though we were a two year old, even when
we are adults.

As our higher cortical cells mature and become
integrated in complex networks with other neurons, we
gain the ability to take "new pictures" of the present
moment. When we compare the new information of our
thinking mind with the automatic reactivity of our limbic
mind, we can reevaluate the current situation and
purposely choose a more mature response.

It might be of interest to note that all of today's "brain
based learning" techniques used in elementary through high school
capitalize on what neuroscientists understand about the functions of the
limbic system. With these learning techniques, we try to transform our
classrooms into environments that feel safe and familiar. The objective is
to create an environment where the brain's fear/rage response (amygdala)
is not triggered. The primary job of the amygdala is to scan all incoming
stimulation in this immediate moment and determine the level of safety.
One of the jobs of the cingulate gyrus of the limbic system is to focus the
brain's attention.

When incoming stimulation is perceived as familiar, the amygdala
is calm and the adjacently positioned hippocampus is capable of learning
and memorizing new information. However, as soon as the amygdala is
triggered by unfamiliar or perhaps threatening stimulation, it raises the
brain's level of anxiety and focuses the mind's attention on the
immediate situation. Under these circumstances, our attention is shifted
away from the hippocampus and focused toward self-preserving
behavior about the present moment.

Sensory information streams in through our sensory systems and is
immediately processed through our limbic system. By the time a
message reaches our cerebral cortex for higher thinking, we have already
placed a "feeling" upon how we view that stimulation - is this pain or is
this pleasure? Although many of us may think of ourselves as _thinking_
_creatures that feel,_ biologically we are _feeling creatures that think_ .

Because the term "feeling" is broadly used, I'd like to clarify
where different experiences occur in our brain. First, when we
experience _feelings_ of sadness, joy, anger, frustration, or excitement,
these are emotions that are generated by the cells of our limbic system.
Second, to _feel_ something in your hands refers to the tactile or
kinesthetic experience of feeling through the action of palpation. This
type of feeling occurs via the sensory system of touch and involves the
postcentral gyrus of the cerebral cortex. Finally, when someone contrasts
what he or she _feels_ intuitively about something (often expressed as a
"gut feeling") to what they think about it, this insightful awareness is a
higher cognition that is grounded in the right hemisphere of the cerebral
cortex. (In Chapter Three we will discuss more thoroughly the different
ways in which the right and left cerebral hemispheres operate.)

As information processing machines, our ability to process data
about the external world begins at the level of sensory perception.
Although most of us are rarely aware of it, our sensory receptors are
designed to detect information at the energy level. Because everything
around us - the air we breathe, even the materials we use to build with,
are composed of spinning and vibrating atomic particles, you and I are
literally swimming in a turbulent sea of electromagnetic fields. We are
part of it. We are enveloped within it, and through our sensory apparatus
we experience _what is._

Each of our sensory systems is made up of a complex cascade of
neurons that process the incoming neural code from the level of the
receptor to specific areas within the brain. Each group of cells along the
cascade alters or enhances the code, and passes it on to the next set of
cells in the system, which further defines and refines the message. By
the time the code reaches the outermost portion of our brain, the higher
levels of the cerebral cortex, we become conscious of the stimulation.
However, if any of the cells along the pathway fail in their ability to
function normally, then the final perception is skewed away from normal
reality.

Our visual field, the entire view of what we can see when we look
out into the world, is divided into billions of tiny spots or pixels. Each
pixel is filled with atoms and molecules that are in vibration. The retinal
cells in the back of our eyes detect the movement of those atomic
particles. Atoms vibrating at different frequencies emit different
wavelengths of energy, and this information is eventu coded as
different colors by the visual cortex in the occi region of our
brain. A visual image is built by our br ability to package
groups of pixels together in the form edges. Different edges
with different orientations - vert horizontal, and oblique,
combine to form complex ima Different groups of cells in our
brain add depth, color, motion to what we see. Dyslexia,
whereby some wr letters are perceived in reverse from normal,
is a g example of a functional abnormality that can occur when
normal cascade of sensory input is altered.

Similar to vision, our ability to hear sound also depends
upon our detection of energy traveling at different wavelengths.

Sound is the product of atomic particles in space colliding with
one another and emitting patterns of energy. The energy
wavelengths, created by the bombarding particles, beat upon the
tympanic membrane in our ear. Different wavelengths of sound
vibrate our eardrum with unique properties. Similar to our retinal
cells, the hair cells of our auditory Organ of Corti translate this
energy vibration in our ear into a neural code. This eventually
reaches the auditory cortex (in the temporal region of our brain)
and we hear sound.

Our most obvious abilities to sense atomic/molecular
information occur through our chemical senses of smell and
taste. Although these receptors are sensitive to individual
electromagnetic particles as they waft past our nose or titillate our taste
buds, we are all unique in how much stimulation is required before we
can smell or taste something. Each of these sensory systems is also made
up of a complex cascade of cells, and damage to any portion of the
system may result in an abnormal ability to perceive.

Finally, our skin is our largest sensory organ, and it is stippled with
very specific sensory receptors designed to experience pressure,
vibration, light touch, pain, or temperature. These receptors are precise
in the type of stimulation they perceive such that only cold stimulation
can be perceived by cold sensory receptors and only vibration can be
detected by vibration receptors. Because of this specificity, our skin is a
finely mapped surface of sensory reception.

The innate differences we each experience in terms of how
sensitive we are to different types of stimulation contribute greatly to
how we perceive the world. If we have problems hearing when people
speak, then we will hear only bits and pieces of conversation and make
decisions and judgments based upon minimal information. If our
eyesight is poor, then we will focus on fewer details and our interaction
with the world will be affected. If our sense of smell is deficient, then we
may not be able to discriminate between a safe environment and a health
hazard, rendering us more vulnerable. At the opposite extreme, if we are
oversensitive to stimulation, we may avoid interacting with our
environment and miss out on life's simple pleasures.

Pathology and disease of the mammalian nervous system generally
involves the brain tissue that distinguishes that specific species from
other species. Consequently, in the case of the human system, the outer
layers of our cerebral cortex are often vulnerable to disease. Stroke is the
number one disabler in our society and the number three killer.

Because neurological disease often involves the higher cognition
layers of our cerebral cortex, and because stroke occurs four times
more frequently in the left cerebral hemisphere, our ability to create or
understand language is often compromised. The term stroke refers to a
problem with the blood vessels carrying oxygen to the cells of the
brain, and there are basically two types: ischemic (ih-skee-mik) and
hemorrhagic (hem-o-radg-ik).

According to the American Stroke Association, the ischemic
stroke accounts for approximately 83% of all strokes. Arteries carry
blood into the brain and their shape tapers smaller and smaller as they
travel farther away from the heart. These arteries carry life-supporting
oxygen necessary for cells, including neurons, to survive. With
ischemic stroke, a blood clot travels into the artery until the tapered
diameter of the artery becomes too small for the clot to pass any
farther. The blood clot blocks the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the
cells beyond the point of obstruction. Consequently, brain cells
become traumatized and often die. Since neurons generally do not
regenerate, the dead neurons are not replaced. The function of the
deceased cells may be lost permanently, unless other neurons adapt
over time to carry out their function. Because every brain is unique in
its neurological wiring, every brain is unique in its ability to recover
from trauma.

>(artery is blocked and oxygen cannot get to cells): (động mạch bị tắc nghẽn và oxy không thể đến được các tế bào)

The hemorrhagic stroke occurs when blood escapes from the
arteries and floods into the brain. Seventeen percent of all strokes are
hemorrhagic. Blood is toxic to neurons when it comes in direct contact
with them, so any leak or

vascular blowout can have devastating effects on the brain. One form
of stroke, the aneurysm (an-yu-rism), forms when there is a weakening
in the wall of a blood vessel that consequently balloons out. The
weakened area fills with blood and can readily rupture, spewing large
volumes of blood into the skull. Any type of hemorrhage is often life
threatening.

>(normal thick wall of blood vessel): (thành mạch máu dày bình thường)

An arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a rare form of
hemorrhagic stroke. It is a congenital disorder whereby an individual
is born with an abnormal arterial configuration. Normally, the heart
pumps blood through arteries with high pressure while blood is
retrieved through veins, which are low pressure. A capillary bed acts
as a buffering system or neutral zone between the high-pressure
arteries and the low-pressure veins.

>capillary: mao mạch (Các mạch máu nhỏ nhất, nơi diễn ra sự trao đổi chất giữa máu và tế bào)
>vein: tĩnh mạch (Mạch máu mang máu đã khử oxy trở về tim)


In the case of the AVM, an artery is directly connected to a vein
with no buffering capillary bed in between. Over time, the vein can no
longer handle the high pressure from

the artery and the connection between the artery and vein is broken spilling blood into the brain. Although the AVM accounts for only 2% of
all hemorrhagic strokes, [3] it is the most common form of stroke that
strikes people during their prime years of life (ages 25-45). I was 37
when my AVM blew.

Regardless of the mechanical nature of the vascular problem, be it
a blood clot or a hemorrhage, no two strokes are identical in their
symptoms because no two brains are absolutely identical in their
structure, connections or ability to recover. At the same time, it is
impossible to talk about the symptoms resulting from stroke without
having a conversation about the innate differences between the right and
left cerebral hemispheres. Although the anatomical structure of the two
hemispheres is relatively symmetrical, they are quite diverse in not only
how they process information, but also in the types of information they
process.

The better we understand the functional organization of the two
cerebral hemispheres, the easier it is to predict what deficits might occur
when specific areas are damaged. Perhaps more important, we might
gain some insight into what we can do to help stroke survivors recover
lost function.
