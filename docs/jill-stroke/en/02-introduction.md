# INTRODUCTION

Every brain has a story and this is mine. Ten years ago, I was at
Harvard Medical School performing research and teaching young
professionals about the human brain. But on December 10, 1996, I was
given a lesson of my own. That morning, I experienced a rare form of
stroke in the left hemisphere of my brain. A major hemorrhage, due to
an undiagnosed congenital malformation of the blood vessels in my
head, erupted unexpectedly. Within four brief hours, through the eyes of
a curious brain anatomist (neuroanatomist), I watched my mind
completely deteriorate in its ability to process information. By the end
of that morning, I could not walk, talk, read, write, or recall any of my
life. Curled up into a little fetal ball, I felt my spirit surrender to my
death, and it certainly never dawned on me that I would ever be capable
of sharing my story with anyone.

_My Stroke Of Insight: A Brain Scientist's Personal Journey_ is a
chronological documentation of the journey I took into the formless
abyss of a silent mind, where the essence of my being became enfolded
in a deep inner peace. This book is a weaving of my academic training
with personal experience and insight. As far as I am aware, this is the
first documented account of a neuroanatomist who has completely
recovered from a severe brain hemorrhage. I am thrilled that
these words will finally go out into the world where they might do the
most good.

More than anything, I am grateful to be alive and celebrative of the
time I have here. Initially, I was motivated to endure the agony of
recovery thanks to the many beautiful people who reached out with
unconditional love. Over the years, I have remained obedient to this
project because of the young woman who contacted me out of
desperation to understand why her mother, who died from stroke, had
not dialed 9-1-1. And because of the elderly gentleman, who was laden
with worry that his wife had suffered enormously while in a coma before
her death. I have remained tethered to my computer (with my faithful
dog Nia on my lap) for the many caregivers who have called in search of
direction and hope. I have persisted with this work for the 700,000
people in our society (and their families) who will experience stroke this
year. If just one person reads "The Morning of the Stroke," recognizes
the symptoms of stroke and calls for help - sooner rather than later, then
my efforts over the last decade will be more than rewarded.

_My Stroke of Insight_ falls into four natural divisions. The first
portion, "Jill's Pre-Stroke Life," introduces you to who I was before my
brain went offline. I describe why I grew up to be a brain scientist, a
little of my academic journey, my advocacy interests, and my personal
quest. I was living large. I was a brain scientist at Harvard, serving on
the national board of NAMI (the National Alliance on Mental Illness)
and traveling the country as the _Singin' Scientist._ I follow this very brief
personal synopsis with a little simple science, which is designed to help
you understand what was going on in my brain biologically on the
morning of the stroke.

If you ever wondered what it might feel like to have a stroke, then
"The Morning of the Stroke" chapters are for you. Here, I take you on a
very unusual journey into the step-by-step deterioration of my cognitive
abilities, as viewed through the eyes of a scientist. As the hemorrhage in
my brain grew larger and larger, I relate the cognitive deficits I
was experiencing to the underlying biology. As a neuroanatomist, I must
say that I learned as much about my brain and how it functions during
that stroke, as I had in all my years of
academia. By the end of that morning, my consciousness shifted into a
perception that I was at _one_ with the universe. Since that time, I have

come to understand how it is that we are capable of having a "mystical"
or "metaphysical" experience - relative to our brain anatomy.

If you know of someone who has had a stroke or some other type
of brain trauma, then the recovery chapters may
prove to be an invaluable resource. Here, I share the chronological
journey of my recovery, including over fifty tips about things I needed
(or didn't need) in order to recover completely. My "Recommendations
for Recovery" are listed in Appendix B for your convenience. I hope you
will share this information with anyone who may benefit.

Finally, "My Stroke of Insight" defines what this stroke has taught
me about my brain. At this point, you will realize that this book is not
really about stroke. More accurately, the stroke was the traumatic event
through which the insight came. This book is about the beauty and
resiliency of our human brain because of its innate ability to
constantly adapt to change and recover function. Ultimately, it's
about my brain's journey into my right hemisphere's
consciousness, where I became enveloped in a deep inner peace. I
have resurrected the consciousness of my left hemisphere in order to
help others achieve that same inner peace - without having to experience
stroke! I hope you enjoy the journey.
