# 10. Day Three: G.G. Comes to Town

On the morning of day three, I was moved out of Neurology
ICU and ended up sharing a room with a very interesting character.
This woman had been suffering from epileptic seizures so the
doctors had her head all wrapped up in a large white towel, with
numerous electrodes and wires protruding from her head in all
directions. The wires were attached to a variety of recording devices
that lined her side of the room and, although she was free to move
about between her bed, chair, and bathroom, she was quite the sight!
I'm sure all of my visitors thought she resembled Medusa. Out of
boredom, she routinely struck up a conversation with everyone who
looked in on me. I, on the other hand, was desperate for silence and
minimal sensory stimulation. The TV noise from her half of the
room was a painful suction of my energy. I considered it totally
counterintuitive to my idea of what I found to be conducive for
healing.

There was a lot of excitement floating in the air that morning.
My colleagues, Francine and Steve, had already arrived and several
doctors were milling about the immediate area. The results were in
from the angiogram and it was time to get down to the business of
setting my treatment plan. I remember clearly the moment G.G.
came around the corner into my room. She looked me straight in the
eye and came right to my bedside. She was gracious and calm, said
her hellos to those in the room, and then lifted my sheet and
proceeded to crawl into bed with me. She immediately wrapped me
up in her arms and I melted into the familiarity of her snuggle. It
was an amazing moment in my life. Somehow she understood that I
was no longer her Harvard doctor daughter, but instead I was now
her infant again. She says she did what any mother would have
done. But I'm not so sure. Having been born to my mother was truly
my first and greatest blessing. Being born to her a second time has
been my greatest fortune.

I felt perfectly content all wrapped up in my mother's love. She
was kind and soft and obviously freaking out a little, but overall, I
thought she was nice and I liked her. It was a perfect moment for me,
and who could ask for anything more? I was catheterized so I never had
to get out of bed and this very nice woman walked right into my life and
surrounded me with love!

And then the conference began. Introductions were made, reports
were in, and all the key players were present. Dr. Young set the tone and
spoke directly to me as though I could understand. I appreciated that she
did not simply speak to the others about me. First, she introduced Dr.
Christopher Ogilvy, a neurosurgeon who specialized in arteriovenous
malformations (AVMs). Dr. Ogilvy explained that the angiogram
confirmed that my brain contained an AVM, and this congenital
malformation was responsible for my hemorrhage. I had a history of
migraine headaches which never responded to medication. As it turns
out, my physicians predicted that I was not having migraines at all, but
was experiencing small bleeds over the years.

Although I could not understand much of what was being said
during this pow-wow around my bedside, I was focused on what was
being conveyed nonverbally. The expressions on people's faces, the
tones of their voices, how they held their bodies as they exchanged
information - were fascinating to me. In a funny sort of way, I was
comforted to know that the gravity of my situation did actually warrant
all of this fuss. No one wants to create this much commotion only to
learn that, no, it was not really a heart attack - just gas!

The atmosphere in the room was tense as Dr. Ogilvy described the
problems with the blood vessels in my brain. When he suggested that I
have a craniotomy to remove the remnants of the AVM and a clot the
size of a golf ball, G.G. became unglued and her nervousness was
obvious. Dr. Ogilvy further explained that if the AVM were not
surgically removed, I stood the likely chance of hemorrhaging again and
next time, I might not be so lucky getting help.

Honestly, I didn't really understand all of the details about what
they were proposing to do - partly because the cells in my brain that
understood language were swimming in a pool of blood and partly
because of the sheer speed of their conversation. In my condition, I
thought I understood that they were planning on passing a suction
instrument up through my femoral artery into my brain to suck out the
excess blood and threatening tangle of vessels. I was aghast when I
realized it was their plan to cut my head open! Any self-respecting

neuroanatomist would _never_
allow anyone to cut their head open!
Intuitively, if not academically, I understood that the pressure dynamics
between the thoracic, abdominal and cranial cavities are so delicately
balanced that any major invasion like a craniotomy would certainly
throw all of my energy dynamics completely out of whack. I feared that
if they opened my head while I was already energetically compromised,
I would never be able to recover my body or any of my cognition.

I made it perfectly clear to everyone that under no circumstances
would I ever agree to permit them to open my head. No one seemed to
understand that my body was already thoroughly deflated and I would
not be able to survive another severe blow - even if it was a highly
calculated one. Nevertheless, I knew I was vulnerable and at the mercy
of the people in this room.

The meeting ended with the craniotomy option temporarily tabled,
even though it was clear to everyone (except me) that it was now G.G.'s
job to convince me to have the surgery. With tremendous compassion,
G.G. intuited my fears and tried to comfort me, "That's okay sweetie,
you don't have to have the surgery. No matter what, I'll take care of you.
But if you don't have that AVM removed, there will always be the
possibility that your brain will spit blood again. In that case, you can
move in with me and I'll be attached to your hip for the rest of your life!"
While my mom is a wonderful woman, living my life with her attached
to my hip was not what I had in mind. Within a couple of days, I agreed
to have the surgery to remove the AVM. It then became my job to get
my body strong enough, over the next few weeks, to survive the pending
blow.

For the next few days following the stroke, my stamina waxed and
waned proportionately with my napping and exerted effort. I learned
early that every effort I put forth was the only effort that was important.
On day one, for example, I had to rock and rock and rock some more
before I had enough oomph to roll upward. While in this stage of
rocking, I had to recognize that rocking was the only activity that
mattered. Focusing my success on the final goal of sitting up was not
wise because it was far beyond my current ability. If I had decided that
sitting-up was the goal, and then tried and failed repeatedly on every
trial, I would have been disappointed with my inability and stopped
trying. By breaking the effort of sitting-up into the smaller steps of
rocking and then rolling upward, I found regular success along the way and celebrated accordingly - with sleep. So it was my strategy to rock
and then rock some more. Once I mastered rocking frequently, then I
strove to rock with enthusiasm. By the time I could rock with ease, my
body flowed into the next natural movement of rolling upward. And then
again, my efforts were all about rolling upward, frequently, and then
with enthusiastic vigor. Rolling upward with enthusiasm led me right
into sitting up and I enjoyed the ongoing satisfaction of success.

Essentially, I had to completely inhabit the level of ability that I
could achieve before it was time to take the next step. In order to attain a
new ability, I had to be able to repeat that effort with grace and control
before taking the next step. Every little _try_ took time and energy, and
every effort was echoed by a need for more sleep.

By day four, I was still spending most of my time sleeping as my
brain craved minimal stimulation. It was not that I was depressed, but
my brain was on sensory overload and could not process the barrage of
incoming information. G.G. and I agreed that my brain knew best what it
needed to do in order to recover. Unfortunately, it is not common for
stroke survivors to be permitted to sleep as much as they would like. But
for me, we felt that sleep was my brain's way of taking a "time-out" from
new stimulation. We acknowledged that my brain was still physically
traumatized and it was obviously totally confused concerning the
information coming in through my sensory systems. We agreed that my
brain needed quiet time to make sense out of what it had just
experienced. For me, sleep was filing time. You know how chaotic an
office can become if you don't take time to file? It was the same for my
brain - it needed time to organize, process and file its hourly load.

I had to choose between physical and cognitive efforts because
they both wore me out. On the physical front, I was making terrific
progress regaining my basic stability. I could sit up with some ease now,
stand and even walk a little down the hall with lots of assistance. My
voice, on the other hand, was weak since I had no strength to expel air.
As a result, I spoke in a soft whisper and my speech was broken and
labored. I struggled with finding the right word and frequently confused
meanings. I remember thinking water but saying milk.

Cognitively, I struggled to comprehend my existence. I still
couldn't think in terms of past or future so I burned a lot of mental
energy trying to piece together my present moment. Although thinking
was very difficult for me, I was making cognitive improvement. I had
grown accustomed to my doctor telling me to remember three things,
and then at the end of our time together, asking me what those three
things had been. G.G. says that she knew I was going to be all right the
day he asked me to remember: firefighter, apple, and 33 Whippoorwill
Drive. I had failed this task miserably up to this point, but I decided that
today I was going to pay attention to nothing else that he said and just
repeat the words over and over again in my mind, holding them in
memory until it was time to blurt them out. At the end of our visit, he
asked me to recall the three items. With confidence I uttered,
"Firefighter, apple, something Whippoorwill Drive." Then I added that
although I couldn't recall the exact address, I'd go up and down the street
knocking on every door until I found the right house! G.G. breathed a
huge sigh of relief when she heard this. To her it indicated that my
resourceful brain was back on track, and she was reassured that I would
once again be able to find my way in the world.

On that same day, Andrew came for his daily visit and one of the
games he would play with me to assess my cognitive aptitude was to ask
me to count backwards from 100 by sevens. This task was particularly
difficult for me because the cells in my brain that understood
mathematics had been permanently destroyed. I asked someone for the
first few answers to that question and the next time Andrew asked me, I
spewed three or four of the correct responses! I immediately confessed
that I had cheated and really had no clue how to begin this task. But it
was important to me that Andrew understand that although certain
portions of my mind could not function, other parts of my brain, in this
case my scheming mind, would compensate for lost abilities.

On day five, it was time for me to go home to get strong enough to
endure surgery. A physical therapist taught me how to climb a stair, with
support, and then I was released to G.G.'s care. I felt physically in peril
as my mother drove like a Hoosier provincial in downtown Boston
traffic! We draped my face to block out the sunlight. I prayed the whole
way home.
