# 5. Orchestrating My Rescue

I didn't know exactly what type of stroke I was experiencing, but
the congenital arteriovenous malformation (AVM) that burst in my head
was spewing a large volume of blood over the left hemisphere of my
brain. As blood swept over the higher thinking centers of my left
cerebral cortex, I began losing my skills of higher cognition - one
precious ability at a time. It was fortunate that I could remember that the
best prognosis for someone having a stroke was to get him or her to the
hospital as quickly as possible. But getting help was challenging because
I found it almost impossible to concentrate or keep my mind on task. I
caught myself chasing random thoughts as they danced in and out of my
brain, and sadly, I was fully aware that I was inept at holding a plan in
my mind long enough to execute it.

The two cerebral hemispheres of my brain had worked
meticulously well together for my entire life, as they enabled me to
function in the world. But now, because of the normal differences and
asymmetry of function between my right and left hemispheres, I felt
disjoined from the linguistic and calculating skills of my left brain.
Where were my numbers? Where was my language.. .what had become
of the brain chatter, which was now replaced by a pervasive and enticing
inner peace?

Without the linearity associated with the constant brain directives
of my left brain, I struggled to maintain a cognitive connection to my
external reality. Instead of a continuous flow of experience that could be
divided into past, present, and future, every moment seemed to exist in
perfect isolation. In this emptiness of verbal cues, I felt devoid of my
worldly wisdom and I was desperate to maintain a cognitive link
between my moments. Repetitively, I obsessed the only message my
brain could sustain: _What am I trying to do? Get help. I'm trying to make a plan and get help. What am I doing? I have to come up with a plan to get help. Okay. I have to get help._

My information processing for normal access to my brain's
information, prior to this morning's episode, went something like this: I
visualize myself sitting in the middle of my brain, which is completely
lined with filing cabinets. When I am looking for a thought or an idea or
a memory, I scan the cabinets and identify the correct drawer. Once I
find the appropriate file, I then have access to all of the information in
that file. If I don't immediately find what I'm looking for, then I put my
brain back on scan and eventually I access the right data.

But this morning, my information processing was completely
aberrant. Even though my brain remained lined with filing cabinets, it
was as if all the drawers had been slammed shut and the cabinets pushed
just beyond my reach. I was aware that I knew all this stuff, that my
brain held a wealth of information. But where was it? If the information
was still there, I could no longer retrieve it. I wondered if I would ever
reconnect with linguistic thought or retrieve the mental images of my
life. I was saddened that perhaps those portions of my mind were now
lost forever.

Devoid of language and linear processing, I felt disconnected from
the life I had lived, and in the absence of my cognitive pictures and
expansive ideas, time escaped me. The memories from my past were no
longer available for recollection, leaving me cloaked from the bigger
picture of who I was and what I was doing here as a life form. Focused
completely in the present moment, my pulsing brain felt like it was
gripped in a vice. And here, deep within the absence of earthly
temporality, the boundaries of my earthly body dissolved and I melted
into the universe.

As the hemorrhaging blood interrupted the normal functioning of
my left mind, my perception was released from its attachment to
categorization and detail. As the dominating fibers of my left
hemisphere shut down, they no longer inhibited my right hemisphere,
and my perception was free to shift such that my consciousness could
embody the tranquility of my right mind. Swathed in an enfolding sense
of liberation and transformation, the essence of my consciousness
shifted into a state that felt amazingly similar to my experience in
Thetaville. I'm no authority, but I think the Buddhists would say I
entered the mode of existence they call Nirvana.

In the absence of my left hemisphere's analytical judgment, I was
completely entranced by the feelings of tranquility, safety, blessedness,
euphoria, and omniscience. A piece of me yearned to be released
completely from the captivity of this physical form, which throbbed with
pain. But providentially, in spite of the attraction of this unremitting
temptation, something inside of me remained committed to the task of
orchestrating my rescue, and it persevered to ultimately save my life.

Stumbling into my office space, I turned the lights down low
because the light stimulation burned my brain like wildfire. The harder I
tried to stay focused and concentrate on what I was doing in the here and
now, the more intense the throbbing in my head reverberated. It took
great effort just to stay attentive and my mind groped to hold on, to
remember, _What is it I'm doing? What am I doing? Call for help, I'm trying to call for help!_ I vacillated between moments of being able to
think clearly (I call these "waves of clarity"), and the lack of ability to
think at all.

Feeling cast out of synchrony with the life I had known, I was
concurrently disturbed and fascinated by what I was witnessing as the
systematic breakdown of my cognitive mind. Time stood still because
that clock that would sit and tick in the back of my left brain, that clock
that helped me establish linearity between my thoughts, was now silent.
Without the internal concept of relativity or the complementary brain
activity that helped me navigate myself linearly, I found myself floating
from isolated moment to isolated moment. "A" no longer had any
relationship to "B" and "one" was no longer relative to "two." These
types of sequences required an intellectual connection that my mind
could no longer perform. Even the simplest of calculations, by
definition, requires recognition of the relationship between different
entities, and my mind was no longer capable of creating combinations.
So again, I sat befuddled, waiting for the next intermittent thought or
wave of clarity. In anticipation of the eventual arrival of an idea that
would connect me to something in objective reality, my mind kept
repeating, _What is it I'm trying to do?_

Why didn't I just call 9-1-1? The hemorrhage growing in my
cranium was positioned directly over the portion of my left brain that
understood what a number was. The neurons that coded 9-1-1 were now
swimming in a pool of blood, so the concept simply didn't exist for me
anymore. Why didn't I just skip downstairs and ask my landlady for
help? She was home on maternity leave and would have been happy to
give me a lift. But her file, again, a detail in the big picture of my life in
relation to those around me, didn't exist anymore. Why didn't I walk out
into the street and flag down a stranger for help? It never crossed my
mind. In this incapacitation, the only option I had was the one I was
desperate to remember - which was how to call for help!

All I could do was sit and wait; sit patiently with the phone by my
side and wait in the silence. So there I sat, home alone with these
transient thoughts that evaded me, almost teasing me as they flitted in
and out of my mind. I sat waiting for a wave of clarity that would permit
my mind to connect two thoughts and give me a chance at forming an
idea, a chance to execute a plan. I sat silently intoning, _What am I doing? Call for help. Call for help. I'm trying to call for help_

In the hope that I might consciously evoke another wave of clarity,
I placed the phone on the desk in front of me and stared at its keypad.
Searching for some recollection of a number to dial, my wandering brain
felt empty and sore as I forced it to concentrate and pay attention.
Pulsing, pulsing, pulsing. Gosh my brain hurt. In an instant a number
flashed through my mind's eye. It was my mother's number. How
thrilling that I could remember! How wonderful that I could not only
recall a number but that I knew whose number it was! And how
remarkable, though unfortunate, that even in this precarious condition, I
realized that my mother lived over a thousand miles away and how
inappropriate it would be to call her now. I thought to myself, _No way, I can't call Mama and tell her I'm having a stroke! That would be horrible. She would freak out! I've got to come up with a plan._

In a moment of clarity, I knew that if I called work, my colleagues
at the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center would get me help. _If only I could remember the number at work._ And how ironic it was that I had
spent the previous two years singing the Brain Bank jingle to audiences
all around the country, including the lyrics, "Just dial 1-800-BrainBank
for information please!" But on this morning, with all those memories
set beyond my reach, I retained only a vague idea of who I was and what
I was trying to accomplish. Posed at my desk in a bizarre mental fog, I
continued to coax my mind by obsessing, _What is the number at work? Where do I work? The Brain Bank. I work at the Brain Bank. What is the number at the Brain Bank? What am I doing? I'm calling for help. I'm calling work. Okay, what is the number at work?_

My normal perception of this external world had been successfully
established by the constant exchange of information between my right
and left hemispheres. Because of cortical laterality, each half of my brain
specialized in slightly varied functions, and when put together, my brain
could precisely manufacture a realistic perception of the external world.
Although I had been a very bright child with tremendous potential for
learning, my two hemispheres had never been equal in their natural
abilities. My right hemisphere excelled at understanding the big picture
of ideas and concepts, but my left hemisphere had to work extremely
hard to memorize random facts and details. As a result, I was one of
those people who rarely chose to cognitively code a phone number as a
random sequence of numbers. Instead, my mind automatically created
some sort of pattern, most often a visual pattern, to which I attached the
sequence. In the case of phone numbers, I generally memorized the
pattern as it dialed on a touch-tone keypad. Privately, I always wondered
how I would have survived in a world of rotary telephones where such
schematic ploys would have been much more challenging!

Throughout my youth, my mind had been much more interested in
how things were intuitively related (right hemisphere) than how they
were categorically different (left hemisphere). My mind preferred
thinking in pictures (right hemisphere), as opposed to language (left
hemisphere). It wasn't until my graduate school years and fascination
with anatomy that my mind excelled in detail memorization and
retrieval. After a childhood of information processing through sensory,
visual, and pattern association strategies, the tapestry of my knowledge
was all intimately inter-linked.

The downfall to this type of a learning system, of course, is that it
only works when all the pieces of the network are functioning and
interacting properly. On this morning, as I sat and contemplated the
phone number for work, I remembered that there was something unique
about the patterning of our office codes. Something like, my number
ended in 1-0; which was the exact opposite of my boss's number which
ended in 0-1; and my colleague's number fell right in the middle. But
because my left hemisphere was drowning in a puddle of blood, I could
not access the specifics of my mental inquiry, and the linearity of
mathematics befuddled me. I kept thinking, _What's in the middle between 01 and 10?_ I decided that looking at the phone keypad might be
helpful.

Sitting at my desk, I placed the phone directly in front of me and
sat patiently for a few moments awaiting the next wave of clarity. Again
I intoned, _What is the number at work? What is the number at work?_
After several minutes of holding the phone and drawing a blank, a list of
four digits suddenly appeared in my mind...2405! 2405! I repeated it
over and over to myself. _2405!_ In order to not forget it, I picked up a pen
and with my non-dominant left hand, I quickly jotted down the image I
saw in my mind. A "2" was no longer a "2" but rather a squiggle that
looked like a "2." Fortunately, the "2" on the phone pad looked just like
the "2" in my mind's eye, so I drew the squiggles that represented what I
saw. .2405. Somehow I understood that this was only part of the number,
what was the rest? There was a prefix -something came first. So, again, I
started intoning, _What is the prefix? What is the prefix at work?_

Faced with this dilemma, it occurred to me that it was not
necessarily an advantage that, when we are at work, we merely have to
dial extension numbers. Because of this lack of routine use, the pattern
for my prefix recognition was not coded in the exact same file in my
brain as the rest of the extension numbers. So back I went on a mission
to retrieve information and I questioned, _What is the prefix? What is theprefix at work?_

For my entire life, I had been exposed to phone numbers with very
low prefixes: 232, 234, 332, 335, etc. But grasping at anything flitting
through my mind, any possibility at all, the code 855 flashed as a visual.
Initially, I thought that this was the most absurd prefix I had ever heard,
because the numbers seemed so high. But at this point, anything was
worth a try. In anticipation of the next wave of clarity, I cleared the desk
in front of me. Because it was only 9:15 am, and I was only 15 minutes
late for work, no one would really be missing me yet. With a plan in
mind, I plodded on.

I felt tired. I felt vulnerable and completely fragmented as I sat
there waiting. Although I was consistently distracted by an enveloping
sense of being at _one_ with the universe, I was desperate to carry out my
plan to get help. Within my mind, I rehearsed over and over again what I
needed to do, and what I would say. But keeping my mind tuned in to
what I was trying to do was like struggling to hang on to a slippery fish.
Task one, hold the thought in mind; task two, execute the internal
perception in the external world. Pay attention. Hold on to the fish. Hold
on to the understanding that this is a phone. Hold on. Hold on for the
next functional moment of clarity! I kept rehearsing in my mind, _This is Jill. I need help! This is Jill. I need help!_

This process had already taken 45 minutes for me to figure out
who and how to call for help. During the next wave of clarity, I dialed
the number by matching the squiggles on the paper to the squiggles on
the phone pad. To my great fortune, my colleague and good friend, Dr.
Stephen Vincent, was sitting at his desk. As he picked up the receiver, I could
hear him speak, but my mind could not decipher his words. I thought,
_Oh my gosh, he sounds like a golden retriever!_ I realized that my left
hemisphere was so garbled that I could no longer understand speech.
Yet, I was so relieved to be connected to another human being that I
blurted out, "This is Jill. I need help!" Well, at least that's what I tried
to say. What exactly came out of my mouth was more akin to grunts
and groans, but fortunately Steve recognized my voice. It was clear to
him that I was in some sort of trouble. (Apparently all those years of
hollering up and down the halls at work had earned me a recognizable
squawk!)

I was shocked, however, when I did realize that I could not
speak intelligibly. Even though I could hear myself speak clearly
within my mind, _This is Jill, I need help!,_ the sounds coming out of
my throat did not match the words in my brain. I was disturbed to
comprehend that my left hemisphere was even more disabled than I
had realized. Although my left hemisphere could not decipher the
meaning of the words he spoke, my right hemisphere interpreted the
soft tones in his voice to mean that he would get me help.

Finally, in that moment, I could relax. I didn't need to understand
the details of what he would do. I knew that I had done all that I could
do; all that anyone could have hoped that I would do, to save myself.
