# 19. Finding Your Deep Inner Peace

This stroke of insight has given me the priceless gift of knowing
that deep inner peace is just a thought/feeling away. To experience peace
does not mean that your life is always blissful. It means that you are
capable of tapping into a blissful state of mind amidst the normal chaos
of a hectic life. I realize that for many of us, the distance between our
thinking mind and our compassionate heart sometimes feels miles apart.
Some of us traverse this distance on command. Others of us are so
committed to our hopelessness, anger, and misery that the mere concept
of a peaceful heart feels foreign and unsafe.

Based upon my experience with losing my left mind, I wholeheartedly believe that the feeling of deep inner peace is neurological
circuitry located in our right brain. This circuitry is constantly running
and always available for us to hook into. The feeling of peace is
something that happens in the present moment. It's not something that
we bring with us from the past or project into the future. Step one to
experiencing inner peace is the willingness to be present in the right
here, right now.

The more aware we are of when we run our loop of deep inner
peace, the easier it is for us to purposely choose to hook into that
circuitry. Some of us struggle in our attempts to recognize when we are
running this circuitry only because our minds are distracted by other
thoughts. This makes sense since our western society honors and
rewards the skills of our "doing" left brain much more than our "being"
right brain. Thus, if you are having difficulty accessing the
consciousness of your right mind circuitry, then it is probably because
you have done a stupendous job learning exactly what you were taught
while growing up. Congratulate your cells for their successes, and as my
good friend Dr. Kat Domingo proclaims, "Enlightenment is not a process
of learning, it is a process of unlearning."

Since both of our hemispheres work together to generate our
perception of reality on a moment-by-moment basis, we are exercising
our right mind all the time. Once you learn to recognize the subtle
feelings (and physiology) running through your body when you are
connected to the circuitry of the present moment, you can then train
yourself to reactivate that circuitry on demand. I'm going to share with
you a variety of ways I _re-mind_ myself back into the consciousness and
personality of my right here, right now, peaceful right brain.

The first thing I do to experience my inner peace is to remember
that I am part of a greater structure - an eternal flow of energy and
molecules from which I cannot be separated (see Chapter Two).
Knowing that I am a part of the cosmic flow makes me feel innately safe
and experience my life as heaven on earth. How can I feel vulnerable
when I cannot be separated from the greater whole? My left mind thinks
of me as a fragile individual capable of losing my life. My right mind
realizes that the essence of my being has eternal life. Although I may
lose these cells and my ability to perceive this three-dimensional world,
my energy will merely absorb back into the tranquil sea of euphoria.
Knowing this leaves me grateful for the time I have here as well as
enthusiastically committed to the well-being of the cells that constitute
my life.

In order to come back to the present moment, we must consciously
slow down our minds. To do this, first decide you are not in a hurry.
Your left mind may be rushing, thinking, deliberating, and analyzing, but
your right mind is very m-e-l-l-o-w.

Right now, besides reading this book, what are you doing? Are
you running any cognitive loops in addition to your reading? Are you
watching the clock or sitting in a busy place? Become aware of your
extraneous thoughts, thank them for their service, and ask them to be
silent for a little while. We're not asking them to go away, just to push
the _pause button_ for a few minutes. Rest assured, they're not going
anywhere. When you are ready to reengage with your story-teller again,
it will jump right back online.

When we are hooked into cognitive thoughts and running mental
loops, technically we are not in the present moment. We can be thinking
about something that has already occurred or about something that has
not yet happened, and although our body is right here, right now, our
mind is somewhere else. In order to come back to the experience of the
present moment, allow your consciousness to shift away from those
cognitive loops that distract you away from what is happening right now.

If you will, think about your breathing. Since you are reading this
book, then you are probably sitting in a relaxed state. Draw in a big deep
breath. Go ahead, it's okay. Pull air deep into your chest and watch your
belly swell. What's going on inside your body? Is it in a comfortable
position? Is your stomach feeling calm or queasy? Are you hungry?
How full is your bladder? Do you have a dry mouth? Do your cells feel
tired or refreshed? How is your neck? Just take a pause from any
distracting thoughts and observe your life for a moment. Where are you
sitting? How's the lighting? How do you feel about where you are
sitting? Take another deep breath, and now another. Relax into your
body - soften your jaw and that furrow in your brow. Revel in the fact
that in this moment, you are a living, thriving human being! Let that
feeling of celebration and gratitude flood your consciousness.

To help me find my way back into my peaceful right mind, I look
at how my body organizes information into systems and capitalize on
those already established circuits. I find that paying attention to sensory
information as it streams into my body is a very helpful tool. However, I
don't just focus on the sensory information, I consciously hook into the
physiological experience underlying that sensory circuitry. I ask myself
repeatedly, _how does it feel to be here doing this?_

Eating, drinking, and being merry, is something that happens in the
present moment. Our mouths contain various types of sensory receptors
permitting us the ability to not only taste different flavors but to perceive
unique textures and varied temperatures. Try observing more closely
how different foods taste. Pay attention to the textures of different foods
and how they feel in your mouth. What foods would you classify as fun
food and why? I love chasing around those little individual gelatin balls
in tapioca pudding. Spaghetti is a great texture to play with too. The
most fun I have with food, however, is squishing the guts out of half
frozen peas, or smooshing mashed potatoes between my teeth! I realize
your mother probably expunged these behaviors out of your dining
repertoire when you were young, but in the privacy of your own home,
I'm thinking it's probably okay. It's really hard to entertain stressinducing thoughts when you're having fun with food!

Besides the physical attributes of food consumption, it is vitally
important that we consider the physiological impact food has on our
body and mind. Beyond the traditional focus on nutritional value, try
paying attention to how select foods make your body feel. Both sugar
and caffeine have me crawling out of my skin within minutes after I
consume them. It's a feeling I don't like and thus try to avoid. Eating
foods that contain the chemical tryptophan (milk, bananas, and turkey)
rapidly increase the levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in my brain
and cause me to feel mellow. I purposely choose these foods when I
want to concentrate and feel calm.

In general, carbohydrates turn immediately into sugar and make
my body feel lethargic and my brain spastic. Also, I don't like the way
carbs spike my sugar/insulin response and then leave me craving. I like
the way proteins charge me up and give me energy without stimulating
emotional highs and lows. You may have a different response to these
foods, and that's okay. A balanced diet is important, but paying attention
to how you burn energy and how foods make you feel inside your skin
should be a top priority.

One of the easiest ways to shift just about anyone's mood (for
better or for worse) is through stimulation of their nose. If you are overly
sensitive, life in the real world can be unbearable. Capitalizing on our
noses to shift ourselves back into the present moment is easy. Light a
scented candle and let vanilla, rose or almond lift you up beyond your
recollections of stress. When random smells waft past you, hook into
that cognitive loop and spend quality time trying to identify the scent.
Score it on a scale of one to ten for pleasure or yuck. Remember to feel
the physiology that underlies different scents. Let them move you into
the here and now.

If you are having a problem with your ability to smell, then I'm a
true believer that unless the circuits have been permanently severed, it is
possible to increase your sensitivity. When you purposely pay attention
to the smells around you, you're sending a message to your brain saying
you value that connection. If you want to improve your sense of smell,
spend more time sniffing different scents and talk to your cells! Let them
know you want them to improve their ability. If you are willing to
change your behavior such that you spend more time consciously
thinking about what you are smelling, and you're willing to focus your
mind on the act of smelling, then the neuronal connections will get
reinforced and potentially become stronger.

When it comes to vision, there are basically two ways you can use
your eyes. Take a moment right now to look at the view in front of you.
What do you see? Your right mind takes in the big picture. It sees the
view as a whole where everything is relative. It observes the entire
expanse and does not focus on any of the details. Your left mind
immediately focuses in on the contour of individual objects and
delineates the specific entities making up the view.

When I stand on a mountaintop and let my eyes relax, my right
mind takes in the magnificence of the open vista. Physiologically, I feel
the majesty of the overall view deep inside my being, and I am humbled
by how beautiful our planet is. I can recall this moment by either
reconstructing the vision or by recalling the feeling it elicits. My left
mind is completely different. It eagerly focuses my attention on the
specific types of trees, the colors in the sky, and analyzes the sounds of
specific birds. It discriminates the types of clouds, delineates the tree
line, and registers the temperature of the air.

Right now, take a pause from your reading. Close your eyes and
identify three sounds you hear. Go ahead. Relax your mind and expand
your perception. What do you hear? Listen close and listen far. As I sit
here in Dipper Cabin at the Rocky Ridge Music Center in the Rocky
Mountains near Estes Park, my ears are privy to the gurgling sounds of a
creek as it passes right outside my picture window. When I focus my
mind on distant sounds, I hear bits and pieces of classical music as
children practice their instruments. Focusing my ears up close, I hear the
hum of the heater, right here in the cabin, as it warms me.

Listening to music that you love, in the absence of cognitive
analysis or judgment, is another great way to come back to the here and
now. Let sound move you not just emotionally but physically. Allow
your body to rock and sway or dance and play in accordance with the
rhythm. Surrender your inhibitions and let your body get caught in the
flow.

Of course, the absence of sound can be equally as beautiful. I love
putting my ears under water in the tub to create a space of sound
deprivation. I also focus on my body's gurgles when they occur and send
my cells praise for their ongoing efforts. I have found that my mind is
easily distracted by too much auditory stimulation, so I often work, or
travel, with earplugs. I believe that preventing stimulation overload in
my brain is my responsibility, and earplugs have been a true sanity saver
on many occasions.

Our largest and most diverse sensory organ is our skin. Just as our
brain runs various circuits that think, experience emotion or involve
specific combinations of physiological reactivity, our skin is stippled
with very specific receptors capable of detecting very specific forms of
stimulation. As with our other senses, we are all unique in how sensitive
we are to light touch, pressure, heat and cold, vibration, and pain. Some
of us adapt more quickly than others. Although most of us don't spend
much time thinking about our clothes after we put them on, some of us
remain so sensitive that our minds obsess over their texture or weight. I
thank my cells regularly for their ability to adapt to incoming
stimulation. Imagine how preoccupied our minds would be all the time if
we couldn't.

Humor me again, if you will, and take another pause from your
reading. This time, close your eyes and think about the information you
are currently detecting from your skin. How is the temperature of the
air? What is the texture of your clothing - soft or scratchy, light or
heavy? Is anything pushing up against you - maybe a pet or a pillow?
Just think about your skin for a moment. Can you feel your watch, or
those glasses on your nose? How about your hair draping on your
shoulder?

From a therapeutic perspective, there is perhaps nothing more
intimate than touch, be it physical connection with another human, a
furry friend or even your household plants. The physical benefits of
nurturing and being nurtured are priceless. Simply taking a shower and
feeling the water splashing upon your body is a great way to jolt yourself
back into the present moment. Feeling the pressure of water against your
skin, by taking a bath or playing in a pool, is excellent light pressure and
temperature stimulation. Allow these forms of activity the power to lull
you back into the here and now. Train yourself to pay closer attention to
when your different circuits are stimulated. As you do, you encourage
them to function.

Deep body massage is also great for a number of reasons. Not only
does it help relieve tension in your muscles, but it also increases the
movement of the fluids in your cellular environment. The internal world
of your body is how your cells obtain nutrition and clear their waste. I
enthusiastically support any type of stimulation that increases their
standard of living.

One of my most favorite ways of using touch to come back to the
here and now is through raindrops. Walking in the rain is a
multidimensional experience that moves me deeply. Drops of water
spattering on my face instantly shift me into the beauty and innocence of
my right mind as I feel enveloped by a deep sense of purification.
Feeling the warmth of sunshine upon my face or the kiss of a breeze on
my cheek also connects me directly with a part of myself that feels at
_one_ with all that is. I absolutely love standing on the ocean's edge with
my arms spread wide, flying in the breeze. By remembering the smells,
sounds, tastes, and how I felt deep inside, I can transport myself back to
Nirvana in an instant.

The more attention we pay to the details of how things look,
sound, taste, smell, feel against our skin and feel physiologically inside
our body, the easier it is for our brain to recreate any moment. Replacing
unwanted thought patterns with vivid imagery can help us shift our
consciousness back toward our deep inner peace. Although it is great to
use our senses to rebuild an experience, I believe the real power in
experiential recreation is located in our ability to remember what the
underlying physiology feels like.

It's impossible for me to end this section on the use of sensory
stimulation to bring one into the present moment, and not touch on the
subjects of energy dynamics and intuition. For those of you who have
very sensitive right hemispheres, I know you understand what I am
talking about. At the same time, I appreciate that for many of us, if our
left mind cannot smell it, taste it, hear it, see it or touch it, then we are
skeptical as to whether or not it exists. Our right brain is capable of
detecting energy beyond the limitations of our left mind because of the
way it is designed. I hope your level of discomfort about such things as
energy dynamics and intuition has decreased as you have increased your
understanding about the fundamental differences in the way our two
hemispheres collaborate to create our single perception of reality.

Remembering that we are energy beings designed to perceive and
translate energy into neural code may help you become more aware of
your own energy dynamics and intuition. Can you sense the mood of a
room when you first walk in? Ever wonder why you seem to be content
one minute and then fraught with fear the next? Our right hemisphere is
designed to perceive and decipher the subtle energy dynamics we
perceive intuitively.

Since the stroke, I steer my life almost entirely by paying attention
to how people, places, and things feel to me energetically. In order to
hear the intuitive wisdom of my right mind, however, I must consciously
slow my left mind down so I am not simply carried along on the current
of my chatty story-teller. Intuitively, I don't question why I am
subconsciously attracted to some people and situations, and yet repelled
by others. I simply listen to my body and implicitly trust my instincts.

At the same time, my right mind completely honors the
phenomenon of cause and effect. In a world of energy, where everything
influences everything, it seems naive for me to disregard the insights of
my right mind. If I am shooting a bow and arrow, for example, I don't
just focus on the target's bulls-eye, but I trace the path between the arrow
tip and the center of the target. I visualize the perfect amount of force
exerted by my muscles as they pull back the arrow, and focus my mind
on the fluidity of the process rather than the finality of the end product. I
find that when my perception is expanded and I imagine the experience,
my accuracy is increased. If you are involved in sports, you have the
power to choose how you want to perceive yourself in relationship to
your target or goal. You can see yourself as separate - you positioned at
spot A and your target at spot Z, or you can see yourself at _one_ with the
target and in the flow with all the atoms and molecules in the space
between.

Our right brain perceives the big picture and recognizes that
everything around us, about us, among us and within us is made up of
energy particles that are woven together into a universal tapestry. Since
everything is connected, there is an intimate relationship between the
atomic space around and within me, and the atomic space around and
within you - regardless of where we are. On an energetic level, if I think
about you, send good vibrations your way, hold you in the light, or pray
for you, then I am consciously sending my energy to you with a healing
intention. If I meditate over you or lay my hands upon your wound, then
I am purposely directing the energy of my being to help you heal. How
the arts of Reiki, Feng Shui, acupuncture, and prayer (to mention only a
few) work remain pretty much medical mysteries. This is mostly
because our left brains and science have not yet successfully caught up
with what we understand to be true about how our right hemisphere
functions. However, I believe our right minds are perfectly clear about
how they intuitively perceive and interpret energy dynamics.

Shifting away from the subject of sensory systems, we can also use
the skills of our motor output systems to shift our perspective into the
here and now. Purposely relaxing muscles you routinely hold tense can
help you release pent up energy and feel better. I'm constantly checking
in with the tension in my forehead and inevitably, if I can't fall asleep at
night, I consciously loosen my jaw and then proceed to pass right out.
Thinking about what is going on with your muscles is a great way to pull
your mind back into the present. Systematically squeezing and relaxing
them may help you come back to the here and now.

Lots of people use movement and exercise to shift their minds.
Yoga, Feldenkrais, and Tai Chi are awesome tools for personal
development, relaxation, and growth. Noncompetitive sports are also a
great way to get you back into your body and out of your left brain.
Walking in nature, singing, creating, and playing music, or getting lost in
the arts can easily shift your perspective back to the present moment.

Another avenue for shifting one's focus away from the churning
loops of our left cognitive mind is through purposely using our voice to
interrupt those looping patterns of thought that we find distressful or
distracting. I find that using repetitious sound patterns such as mantra
(which literally means "place to rest the mind") is very helpful. By
breathing deeply and repeating the phrase _In this moment I reclaim my JOY_ or _In this moment I am perfect, whole and beautiful,_ or _I am an innocent and peaceful child of the universe,_ I shift back into the
consciousness of my right mind.

Listening to a verbal meditation that guides me into a thought
pattern with emotion and physiology is another great way to shift my
mind away from unwanted loops. Prayer, whereby we use our mind to
intentionally replace unwanted thought patterns with a chosen set of
thought patterns, is another way to consciously guide one's mind away
from the incessant squirrel cage of verbal repetition into a more peaceful
place.

I absolutely love vocal tuning with sounding bowls. These are
large bowls made of exquisite quartz crystal. When stroked, the bowls
resonate so powerfully that I can feel the vibration right down to my
bones. My worries don't stand a chance at hanging on to my mind when
the sounding bowls are in play.

I also draw Angel Card [1] several times a day to help me stay
focused on what I believe is important in life. The original Angel Cards
come in sets of assorted sizes with each card having a single word
written on them. Every morning when I first get up, I ritualistically
invite an angel into my life and draw a card. I then focus my attention on
that particular angel throughout my day. If I am feeling stressed or have
an important phone call to make, I will often draw another angel to help
me shift my mind. I am always in quest of being open to what the
universe will bring me. I use the Angel Cards to shift me back into a
state of being generous of spirit, as I really like what I attract when I am
open. Some of the angels include: enthusiasm, abundance, education,
clarity, integrity, play, freedom, responsibility, harmony, grace, and birth.
Drawing angels is one of the simplest and most effective tools I have
found to help me shift my mind out of my left hemisphere's judgment.

If I had to pick one output (action) word for my right mind, I
would have to choose _compassion_ . I encourage you to ask yourself, what
does it mean to you to be compassionate? Under what circumstances are
you inclined to be compassionate and what does compassion feel like
inside your body?

Generally, most of us are compassionate with those we see as our
equals. The less attached we are to our ego's inclination for superiority,
the more generous of spirit we can be with others. When we are being
compassionate, we consider another's circumstance with love rather than
judgment. We see a homeless person or a psychotic person and approach
them with an open heart, rather than fear, disgust, or aggression. Think
about the last time you reached out to someone or something with
genuine compassion. How did it feel inside your body? To be
compassionate is to move into the right here, right now with an open
heart consciousness and a willingness to be supportive.

If I had to choose one word to describe the feeling I feel at the core
of my right mind, I would have to say _joy_. My right mind is thrilled to be
alive! I experience a feeling of awe when I consider that I am
simultaneously capable of being at _one_ with the universe, while having
an individual identity whereby I move into the world and manifest
positive change.

If you have lost your ability to experience joy, rest assured the
circuitry is still there. It is simply being inhibited by more anxious
and/or fearful circuitry. How I wish you could lose your emotional
baggage, just like I did, and shift back into your natural state of joy! The
secret to hooking into any of these peaceful states is the willingness to
stop the cognitive loops of thought, worry, and any ideas that distract us
from the kinesthetic and sensory experience of being in the here and
now. Most important, however, our desire for peace must be stronger
than our attachment to our misery, our ego, or our need to be right. I love
that old saying, "Do you want to be right, or do you want to be happy?"

Personally, I really like the way happy feels inside my body and
therefore choose to hook into that circuitry on a regular basis. I've often
wondered, _If it's a choice, then why would anyone choose anything other than happiness?_ I can only speculate, but my guess is that many of us
simply do not realize that we have a choice and therefore don't exercise
our ability to choose. Before my stroke, I thought I was a product of my
brain and had no idea that I had some say about how I responded to the
emotions surging through me. On an intellectual level, I realized that I
could monitor and shift my cognitive thoughts, but it never dawned on
me that I had some say in how I perceived my emotions. No one told me
that it only took 90 seconds for my biochemistry to capture, and then
release me. What an enormous difference this awareness has made in
how I live my life.

Another reason many of us may not choose happiness is because
when we feel intense negative emotions like anger, jealousy, or
frustration, we are actively running complex circuitry in our brain that
feels so familiar that we feel strong and powerful. I have known people
who consciously choose to exercise their anger circuitry on a regular
basis simply because it helps them remember what it feels like to be
themselves.

It is just as easy for me to habitually run the happiness circuit as it
is for me to run the anger circuit. In fact, from a biological perspective,
happiness is the natural state of being for my right mind. As such, this
circuitry is constantly running and is always available for me to tap into.
My anger circuit, on the other hand, does not always run, but can be
triggered when I experience some sort of threat. As soon as the
physiological response has passed out of my blood stream, I can resume
my joy.

Ultimately, everything we experience is a product of our cells and
their circuitry. Once you have tuned in to how different circuits feel
inside your body, then you can pick and choose how you want to be in
the world. I, personally, feel allergic to how fear and/or anxiety feel in
my body. When these emotions surge through me, I feel so
uncomfortable that I want to crawl out of my skin. Because I don't like
the way these emotions feel physiologically, I'm not inclined to hook
into that circuitry on a regular basis.

My favorite definition of fear is "False Expectations Appearing
Real," and when I allow myself to remember that all of my thoughts are
merely fleeting physiology, I feel less moved when my story-teller goes
haywire and my circuitry is triggered. At the same time, when I
remember that I am at _one_ with the universe, then the concept of fear
loses its power. To help protect myself from having a trigger-happy
anger or fear response, I take responsibility for what circuitry I
purposely exercise and stimulate. In an attempt to diminish the power of
my fear/anger response, I intentionally choose not to watch scary movies
or hang out with people whose anger circuitry is easily set off. I
consciously make choices that directly impact my circuitry. Since I like
being joyful, I hang out with people who value my joy.

As I mentioned earlier, physical pain is a physiological
phenomenon that is specifically designed to alert our brain that tissue
damage has occurred somewhere in our body. It's important we realize
that we are capable of feeling physical pain without hooking into the

emotional loop of suffering. I am reminded of how courageous little
children can be when they become extremely ill. Their parents may hook
into the emotional circuitry of suffering and fear, while the child seems
to be adapting to his illness without the same negative emotional drama.
To experience pain may not be a choice, but to suffer is a cognitive
decision. When children are ill, it is often more difficult for the child to
handle parental grief than it is for the child to endure the illness.

The same can be true for anyone who is ill. Please be very careful
what circuits you stimulate when you visit someone who is not well.
Death is a natural process we all must experience. Just realize that deep
inside your right mind (deep within your heart's consciousness) rests
eternal peace. The easiest way I have found to humble myself back into
a state of peaceful grace is through the act of gratitude. When I am
simply grateful, life is simply great!
