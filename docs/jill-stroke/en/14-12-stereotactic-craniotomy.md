# 12. Stereotactic Craniotomy

At 6:00 am on the morning of December 27, 1996, flanked on
either side by G.G. and Kelly, I marched into Massachusetts General
Hospital to have my head cut open. When I think about courage, I
think about that morning.

I have had long blonde hair since I was a little girl. The last
thing I remember saying to Dr. Ogilvy before he injected me with
some meds was, "Hey doc, I'm 37 and single; please don't leave me
totally bald!" On that note, he knocked me out.

G.G. and Kelly were quite upset with how long surgery lasted. It
was late in the afternoon before word finally got to them that I was in
the recovery room. Upon awakening, I realized that I felt different
now. There was brightness in my spirit again and I felt happy. Up to
this point, my emotions had been relatively flat. I had been observing
the world, but not really engaging with it emotionally. I had missed my
childlike enthusiasm since the hemorrhage and was relieved to feel
like "me" again. I knew that whatever the future now held, I could face
it with joy in my heart and I would be all right.

Shortly after awakening from surgery, I discovered that the left
third of my head had been shaved. A nine inch upside down "U"
shaped scar - running three inches up in front of my ear, three inches
horizontally over my ear and three inches down behind my ear, was
covered with an enormous patch of gauze. How nice of the good
doctor to leave the right half of my head covered with hair. The
moment G.G. arrived at my bedside she blurted, "Say something!" Her
greatest fear, of course, was whether or not the surgeons had to take
some of my language center neurons rendering me mute. I was able to
speak to her softly. We both welled up in tears. The surgery had been
an absolute success.

After the surgery, I stayed in the hospital for the next five days.
For the first 48 hours, I begged to have bags of ice applied to my head. I
don't know why, but my brain felt as though it were on fire and the cold
ice relieved the intense heat so I could sleep.

My last night in the hospital was New Year's Eve. In the middle of
the night, I sat up in the window, all alone, watching the lights of
downtown Boston. I wondered what the new year would bring. I
pondered the irony of my experience - a brain scientist having a stroke. I
celebrated the joy I felt and the lessons I had learned. I was touched by
the daunting reality: I was a stroke survivor.

_Please note that I have created a list of "Recommendations for Recovery‚Äù as a synopsis of this chapter's comments and recommendations for how I needed to be assessed and what I needed the most to recover. This list is located in Appendix B and is available for your personal use._

Recovery was a decision I had to make a million times a day. Was
I willing to put forth the effort to _try_ ? Was I willing to momentarily
leave my newly found ecstatic bliss to try to understand or reengage
with something in the external world? Bottom line, was I willing to
endure the agony of recovery? At this level of information processing, I
was well aware of the difference between that which gave me pain
versus that which gave me pleasure. Being out in the la-la land of my
right hemisphere was enticing and wonderful. Trying to engage my
analytical left mind was painful. Because it was a conscious decision
for me to _try_, it was critically important that I be surrounded by
competent and attentive caregivers. Otherwise, frankly, I probably
would not have bothered to make the effort.

In order for me to choose the chaos of recovery over the peaceful
tranquility of the divine bliss that I had found in the absence of the
judgment of my left mind, I had to reframe my perspective from "Why
do I have to go back?" to "Why did I get to come to this place of
silence?" I realized that the blessing I had received from this experience
was the knowledge that deep internal peace is accessible to anyone at
any time. I believe the experience of Nirvana exists in the
consciousness of our right hemisphere, and that at any moment, we can
choose to hook into that part of our brain. With this awareness, I
became excited about what a difference my recovery could make in the
lives of others - not just those who were recovering from a brain
trauma, but everyone with a brain! I imagined the world filled with
happy and peaceful people and I became motivated to endure the agony
I would have to face in the name of recovery. My stroke of insight
would be: _peace is only a thought away, and all we have to do to access it is silence the voice of our dominating left mind._

Recovery, however you define it, is not something you do alone,
and my recovery was completely influenced by everyone around me. **I desperately needed people to treat me as though I would recover completely.** Regardless of whether it would take three months, two
years, 20 years, or a lifetime, I needed people to have faith in my
continued ability to learn, heal, and grow. The brain is a marvelously
dynamic and ever-changing organ. My brain was thrilled with new
stimulation, and when balanced with an adequate amount of sleep, it was
capable of miraculous healing.

I have heard doctors say, "If you don't have your abilities back by
six months after your stroke, then you won't get them back!" Believe me,
this is not true. I noticed significant improvement in my brain's ability to
learn and function for eight full years post-stroke, at which point I
decided my mind and body were totally recovered. Scientists are well
aware that the brain has tremendous ability to change its connections
based upon its incoming stimulation. This "plasticity" of the brain
underlies its ability to recover lost function.

I think of the brain as a playground filled with lots of little
children. All of these children are eager to please you and make you
happy. (What? You think I'm confusing children with puppies?) You
look at the playground and note a group of kids playing kickball, another
group acting like monkeys on the jungle gym, and another group
hanging out by the sand box. Each of these groups of children are doing
different yet similar things, very much like the different sets of cells in
the brain. If you remove the jungle gym, then those kids are not going to
just go away, they are going to mingle with other kids and start doing
whatever else is available to be done. The same is true for neurons. If
you wipe out a neuron's genetically programmed function, then those
cells will either die from lack of stimulation or they will find something
new to do. For example, in the case of vision, if you put a patch over one
eye, blocking visual stimulation coming into the cells of the visual
cortex, then those cells will reach out to the adjacent cells to see if they
can contribute their efforts toward a new function. **I needed the people around me to believe in the plasticity of my brain and its ability to  grow, learn, and recover.**

When it comes to the physical healing of cells, I cannot stress
enough the value of getting plenty of sleep. I truly believe that the brain
is the ultimate authority on what it needs to heal itself. As I mentioned
earlier, for my brain, sleep was "filing time." While awake, energy
stimulation poured into my sensory systems and I was rapidly burned
out by photons stimulating my retinal cells and sound waves beating
chaotically on my tympanic membrane. My neurons could not keep up
with the demand and quickly became incapable of making sense of any
incoming information. At the most elementary level of information
processing, stimulation is energy, and **my brain needed to be protected, and isolated from obnoxious sensory stimulation, which it perceived as noise.**

Over the course of several years, if I didn't respect my brain's need
for sleep, my sensory systems experienced agonizing pain and I became
psychologically and physically depleted. I firmly believe that if I had
been placed in a conventional rehabilitation center where I was forced to
stay awake with a TV in my face, alert on Ritalin, and subjected to rehab
on someone else's schedule, I would have chosen to zone out more and
_try_ less. For my recovery, it was critical that we **honor the healing power of sleep** . I know various methodologies are practiced at
rehabilitation facilities around the country, yet I remain a very loud
advocate for the benefits of sleep, sleep, sleep, and more sleep
interspersed with periods of learning and cognitive challenge.

From the beginning, it was vitally important that my caregivers
permit me the freedom to let go of my past accomplishments so I could
identify new areas of interest. **I needed people to love me - not for the person I had been, but for who I might now become.** When my old
familiar left hemisphere released its inhibitions over my more artistic
and musically creative right hemisphere, everything shifted and I needed
my family, friends, and colleagues to support my efforts at re-inventing
myself. At the essence of my soul, I was the same spirit they loved. But
because of the trauma, my brain circuitry was different now, and with
that came a shifted perception of the world. Although I looked the same
and would eventually walk and talk the same as I did before the stroke,
my brain wiring was different now, as were many of my interests, likes,
and dislikes.

My mind was so impaired. I remember thinking, _Can they take away my Ph.D. ? I don't remember any anatomy!_ I knew that I would
have to find a new career that was amenable to my newly found right
hemisphere gifts. Since I had always loved gardening and lawn care, I
considered this a viable future option. I desperately needed people to
accept me as the person I was at that moment, and permit me the
freedom to evolve as a right hemisphere dominant personality. **I needed those around me to be encouraging. I needed to know that I still had value. I needed to have dreams to work toward.**

As I stated earlier, G.G. and I inherently understood that **it was essential that we challenge my brain systems immediately.**
Connections in my brain had been broken and it was crucial that we restimulate them before they either died or completely forgot how to do
what they were designed to do. For recovery, our success was
completely dependent upon our striking a healthy balance between my
awake effort and sleep downtime. For several months after surgery, I was
banned from the TV, telephone, and talk radio. They did not count as
legitimate relaxation time because they sapped my energy, leaving me
lethargic and not interested in learning. Again, G.G. realized early to
**offer me only multiple-choice questions and never ask me Yes/No questions** . Forced choice demanded that I open old files or create new
ones. Yes/No questions demanded no real thought and G.G. rarely
passed by a good opportunity to activate a neuron.

Because my brain had lost its ability to think linearly, I had to
relearn basic personal care, including how to dress myself. I needed to
be taught to put my socks on before my shoes and why. Although I
couldn't remember the real function for routine household items, I was
very creative in what I chose to use for what purpose. This process of
exploration was exciting. Who knew a fork made a fabulous back
scratcher!

My energy was limited so we had to pick and choose, very
carefully every day, how I would spend my effort. **I had to define my priorities for what I wanted to get back the most and not waste energy on other things.** Although I never thought I would regain
enough of my intellect to become a scientist/teacher again, I realized that
I had an amazing story to tell about the beauty and resiliency of the brain - provided I could reactivate mine. I chose to focus my rehabilitation on
an art project that would help recover my physical stamina, manual
dexterity, and cognitive processing. For this, I decided to create an
anatomically correct stained glass brain! (See book cover.) Step one
required that I come up with a design. Having lost all recollection of
academics, I dug out my neuroanatomy books, spread them on the floor,
and pieced together an image of what I thought would make a relatively
accurate (and attractive) brain. The project exercised my gross motor
skills, balance and equilibrium, as well as fine motor skills for cutting
and manipulating the glass. It took eight full months for me to create that
first stained glass brain. When it was done, it was candy to the eye and I
was motivated to make another one, which now hangs at the Harvard
Brain Bank.

Several months prior to the stroke, I had booked a public
presentation at Fitchburg State College. It was scheduled for April 10,
which marked the four-month anniversary of my stroke. Needing a goal
to work toward, I decided that this would be my first post-stroke public
presentation since it was my top priority to regain fluency with
language. I made the decision that I would attend the Fitchburg gig and
speak for 20 minutes. It was my goal to present in such a manner that the
audience would not realize that I was a stroke survivor. Although this
was an ambitious undertaking, I thought it was reasonable. I embarked
upon multiple strategies to accomplish this feat.

First, I had to do something about my hair! For the first few
months following surgery, I was setting a new fad for hairstyle. Because
the surgeons had shaved only the left third of my head, I looked quite
skewed. However, if I "combed-over" what remained on the right, I
could hide the nine-inch scar. The fun part was trying to figure out how
to disguise the new little hairs peeking out through the comb-over. It was
pretty obvious that I was partially buzzed, but by April, I was sporting
quite a cute little coif. I don't know if my hair gave me away that
afternoon or not, nor whether anyone wondered about those two
Frankenstein-like stereotactic dents in my forehead. (The stereotactic
apparatus is the large halo device physicians use to hold the head
perfectly still during surgery.)

I worked very hard to prepare for that Fitchburg presentation. My
first challenge was to speak clearly and intelligently to an audience, and
my second challenge was to be an expert about the brain. To my good
fortune, I had given a major presentation that had been professionally
videotaped at the National NAMI convention just a few months prior to
the hemorrhage. My primary strategy for recovering my speaking skills
was to watch that video over and over again. I studied how that woman
(me) on the stage worked with the microphone. I watched how she held
her head and body and how she walked across the stage. I listened to her
voice, the melody of how she strung words together, and how altering
her volume moved her audience. I learned how to do what she did by
watching her. I learned how to be me again, how to act like me and walk
and talk like me again, by watching that video.

As for the content and brain expert part, I learned a lot about the
brain from that presentation, but I was no expert! The videotaped
presentation itself was way too much information and way over my
head. I had to wonder if that's what folks in my audience thought too! I
did learn, however, how to pronounce those scientific words, and after
repeated viewings, I understood the story she was telling. I really
enjoyed learning about brain donation, and silently wondered if G.G.
would have donated my brain to science had I died on the morning of the
stroke. I laughed out loud every time I heard the Brain Bank jingle and
felt pangs of grief that that woman no longer existed.

In the best style I could, I put together a 20 minute gig that I
practiced day in and day out for over a month. As long as no one
interrupted me or asked any questions about the brain, I thought I could
get by without anyone detecting signs of my recent stroke. Although I
was rather robotic in my movements, I didn't miss a beat with my slides
and I walked
away from Fitchburg feeling triumphant.

Although I did not qualify for occupational or physical therapy, I
spent significant time in speech therapy for four months following
surgery. Speaking was less of a problem for me than reading. G.G. had
already taught me the letters of the alphabet and the sounds that go with
each of those squiggles, but stringing them together as words, and then
adding meaning, was really more than my brain wanted to handle.
Reading for comprehension was a disaster. On my first meeting with my
speech therapist, Amy Rader, I was to read a story that had 23 facts in it.
She had me read the story out loud and then answer her questions. Out
of 23 questions I scored two right!

When I first started working with Amy, I could read the words out
loud but not attach any meaning to the sounds that came out of my
mouth. Eventually, I could read one word at a time, attach a meaning to
that sound, and then go on to the next word. I think a lot of the problem
was that I could not attach one moment to the next or think linearly. As
long as every moment existed in isolation, then I could not string ideas
or words together. From the inside, I felt as though the reading part of
my brain was all but dead and was not interested in learning again. With
the guidance of Amy and G.G., week by week, I took the steps I needed
in order to achieve my goals. It was very exciting because regaining
vocabulary meant regaining some of the lost files in my brain. Just
trying exhausted me, but slowly, word by hard-fought word, files were
opened and I was re-introduced to the life of the woman I had been.
With G.G. patiently steering from the helm, I found my way back into
the veiled crevices of my gray matter.

**For a successful recovery, it was important that we focus on my ability, not my disability** . By celebrating my achievements every
day, I stayed focused on how well I was doing. I made the choice that it
didn't matter if I could walk or talk or even know my name. If all I was
doing was breathing, then we celebrated that I was alive - and we
breathed deeper together. If I stumbled, then we could celebrate when I
was upright. If I was drooling, we could celebrate swallowing! It was
way too easy to focus on my disabilities because they were vast. **I needed people to celebrate the triumphs I made everyday because my successes, no matter how small, inspired me.**

By the middle of January, a few weeks after surgery, my left brain
language center started to come back online and talk to me again.
Although I really loved the bliss of a silent mind, I was relieved to know
that my left brain had the potential to recover its internal dialogue. Up to
this point, I had struggled desperately to link my thoughts together and
think across time. The linearity of internal dialogue helped build a
foundation and structure for my thoughts.

One of the fundamental secrets to my success was that
**I made the cognitive choice to stay out of my own way during the process of recovery.** An attitude of gratitude goes a long way when it
comes to physical and emotional healing. I enjoyed a lot of my recovery
experience as one process flowed naturally into another. I found that as
my abilities increased, so did my perception of the world. Eventually I
was like a toddler wanting to go out and explore - as long as my mommy
wasn't too far away. I tried a lot of new things, had a lot of successes,
and tried some things that I wasn't ready for yet. But I made the choice
to stay out of my own way emotionally and that meant being very
careful about my self-talk. It would have been really easy, a thousand
times a day, to feel as though I was less than who I was before. I had,
after all, lost my mind and therefore had legitimate reason to feel sorry
for myself. But fortunately, my right mind's joy and celebration were so
strong that they didn't want to be displaced by the feeling that went
along with selfdeprecation, self-pity, or depression.

Part of getting out of my own way meant that **I needed to welcome support, love, and help from others** .

Recovery is a long-term process and it would be years before we would
have any idea what I would get back. I needed to let my brain heal and
part of that meant allowing myself to graciously receive help. Prior to
the stroke, I had been extremely independent. I worked during the week
as a research scientist, traveled on the weekends as the _Singin' Scientist_
and managed my home and personal affairs completely on my own. I
was not comfortable accepting help, but in this state of mental
incapacitation, I needed to let people do things for me. In many ways, I
was fortunate that my left hemisphere was injured, for without that ego
portion of my language center, I welcomed the help of others.

**My successful recovery was completely dependent on my ability to break every task down into smaller and simpler steps of action.** G.G. was a wizard at knowing what I needed to be able to do in
order to proceed to the next level of complexity. Whether I was rocking
and rolling-over with enthusiasm before I could sit up, or learning that it
was okay to step on cracks while walking on the sidewalk, each of these
little stages determined my ultimate success.

Because I could not think linearly, **I needed everyone to assume that I knew nothing so that I could relearn everything from the beginning.**
Pieces of information no longer fit together in my brain. For instance, I
might not know how to use a fork and may need to be shown on several
different occasions. **I needed my caregivers to teach me with patience.**
Sometimes I needed them to show me something over and over again,
until my body and brain could figure out what I was learning. If I didn't
"get it" then it was because that part of my brain had a hole in it and
could not understand or absorb the information. When people raised
their voices while teaching me, I tended to shut down. Like an innocent
puppy that is being yelled at, I would become afraid of that person,
repelled by their energy, and tend to not trust them. It was essential that
my caregivers remember that I was not deaf; my brain was simply
wounded. Most important, I needed my caregivers to teach me the 20 [th]
time with the same patience they had the first time.

**I needed people to come close and not be afraid of me.** I
desperately needed their kindness. I needed to be touched - stroke my
arm, hold my hand, or gently wipe my face if I'm drooling. Just about
everyone knows someone who has had a stroke. If their language center
has been disrupted, the stroke survivor can probably not carry on a
conversation with visitors. I know it can be very uncomfortable for a
healthy person to try to communicate with someone who has had a
stroke, but **I needed my visitors to bring me their positive energy.**
Since conversation is obviously out of the question, I appreciated when
people came in for just a few minutes, took my hands in theirs, and
shared softly and slowly how they were doing, what they were thinking,
and how they believed in my ability to recover. It was very difficult for
me to cope with people who came in with high anxious energy. I really
needed people to take responsibility for the kind of energy they brought
me. We encouraged everyone to soften their brow, open their heart, and
bring me their love. Extremely nervous, anxious or angry people were
counter-productive to my healing.

One of the greatest lessons I learned was how to feel the physical
component of emotion. Joy was a feeling in my body. Peace was a
feeling in my body. I thought it was interesting that I could feel when a
new emotion was triggered. I could feel new emotions flood through me
and then release me. I had to learn new words to label these "feeling"
experiences, and most remarkably, I learned that I had the power to
choose whether to hook into a feeling and prolong its presence in my
body, or just let it quickly flow right out of me.

I made my decisions based upon how things felt inside. There
were certain emotions like anger, frustration or fear that felt
uncomfortable when they surged through my body. So I told my brain
that I didn't like that feeling and didn't want to hook into those neural
loops. I learned that I could use my left mind, through language, to talk
directly to my brain and tell it what I wanted and what I didn't want.
Upon this realization, I knew I would never return to the personality I
had been before. I suddenly had much more say about how I felt and for
how long, and I was adamantly opposed to reactivating old painful
emotional circuits.

Paying attention to what emotions feel like in my body has
completely shaped my recovery. I spent eight years watching my mind
analyze everything that was going on in my brain. Each new day brought
new challenges and insights. The more I recovered my old files, the
more my old emotional baggage surfaced, and the more I needed to
evaluate the usefulness of preserving its underlying neural circuitry.

Emotional healing was a tediously slow process but well worth the
effort. As my left brain became stronger, it seemed natural for me to
want to "blame" other people or external events for my feelings or
circumstances. But realistically, I knew that no one had the power to
make me feel anything, except for me and my brain. Nothing external to
me had the power to take away my peace of heart and mind. That was
completely up to me. I may not be in total control of what happens to my
life, but I certainly am in charge of how I choose to perceive my
experience.
