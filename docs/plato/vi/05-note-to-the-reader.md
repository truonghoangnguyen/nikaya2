# *Note to the Reader*
All proper names and place names are listed, most of them with brief iden-
tiﬁcations, in the Glossary and Index of Names. Unfamiliar concepts are
deﬁned in the Glossary of Terms. Marginal page numbers, known as
“Stephanus” page numbers (after an earlier editor of Plato’s works), are
standardly used in scholarly citations. Line numbers, which are approximate
in translations (including this one), refer to John Burnet, Platonis Opera,
vols. I–V (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1900–1907). The basis for the present
translation is S. R. Slings, Platonis Rempublicam (Oxford: Clarendon Press,
2003).
