# *Book 1*

SOCRATES’ NARRATION BEGINS: *I went down to the Piraeus yesterday*
> *with Glaucon, the son of Ariston, to say a prayer to the goddess,[^1] and also (327a) because I wanted to see how they would manage the festival, since they were holding it for the first time. I thought the procession of the local residents was beautiful, but the show put on by the Thracians was no less so, in my view. After we had said our prayer and watched the procession, we started back toward town.[^2] Then Polemarchus, the son of Cephalus, saw us from a distance (b) as we were hurrying homeward, and told his slave boy to run and ask us to wait for him.The boy caught hold of my cloak[^3] from behind.*

SLAVE: Polemarchus wants you to wait.

> *I turned around and asked where he was.*

SLAVE: He is coming up behind you; please wait for him.

GLAUCON: All right, we will.

> *(c) Shortly after that, Polemarchus caught up with us. Adeimantus, Glaucon’s brother, was with him, and so were Niceratus, the son of Nicias, and some others, all of whom were apparently on their way from the procession.*

POLEMARCHUS: It looks to me, Socrates, as if you two are hurrying to get
away to town.

SOCRATES: That isn’t a bad guess.

POLEMARCHUS: But do you see how many we are?

SOCRATES: Certainly.

POLEMARCHUS: Well, then, either you must prove yourselves stronger
than all these people or you will have to stay here.

SOCRATES: Isn’t there another alternative still: that we persuade you that
you should let us go?

POLEMARCHUS: But could you persuade us, if we won’t listen?

GLAUCON: There is no way we could.

POLEMARCHUS: Well, we won’t listen; you had better make up your mind
to that.
(328a) ADEIMANTUS: You mean to say you don’t know that there is to be a torch
race on horseback for the goddess tonight?

SOCRATES: On horseback? That is something new. Are they going to race
on horseback and hand the torches on in relays, or what?

POLEMARCHUS: In relays. And, besides, there will be an all-night celebra-
tion that will be worth seeing.We will get up after dinner and go to see the
festivities.We will meet lots of young men there and have a discussion. So
(b) stay and do as we ask.

GLAUCON: It looks as if we will have to stay.

SOCRATES: If you think so, we must.

> *So, we went to Polemarchus’ house, and there we found Lysias and Euthydemus, the brothers of Polemarchus, and what is more,Thrasymachus of Chalcedon was there too, and Charmantides of Paeania, and Clitophon, the son of Aristonymus. Polemarchus’ father, Cephalus, was also inside, and I thought he looked quite old.You see, I hadn’t seen him for some time. He was sitting on a sort of chair with cushions and had a wreath on his head, as he had been offering a sacriﬁce in the courtyard.We sat down beside him,since some chairs were arranged in a circle there.As soon as he saw me, Cephalus greeted me:*

Socrates, you don’t often come down to the Piraeus to see us.Yet you
should. If it were still easy for me to make the trip to town, you wouldn’t
have to come here. On the contrary, we would come to you. But as it is,
(d) you ought to come here more often. I want you to know, you see, that in
my case at least, as the other pleasures—the bodily ones—wither away, my
appetites for discussions and their pleasures grow stronger.[^4] So please do as I
ask: have your conversation with these young men, and stay here with us, as
you would with your close friends and relatives.

SOCRATES: I certainly will, Cephalus. In fact, I enjoy engaging in discus-
(e) sion with the very old. I think we should learn from them—since they are
like people who have traveled a road that we too will probably have to fol-
low—what the road is like, whether rough and difﬁcult or smooth and easy.
And I would be particularly glad to ﬁnd out from you what you think
about it, since you have reached the point in life the poets call old age’s
threshold.[^5] Is it a difﬁcult time of life? What have you to report about it?
(329a) CEPHALUS: By Zeus, Socrates, I will tell you exactly what I think.You see,
(a) number of us who are more or less the same age often get together, so as
to preserve the old saying.[^6] When they meet, the majority of our members
lament, longing for the lost pleasures of their youth and reminiscing about
sex, drinking parties, feasts, and the other things that go along with them.

They get irritated, as if they had been deprived of important things, and
had lived well then but are not living now. Some others, too, even moan
(b) about the abuse heaped on old people by their relatives, and for that reason
recite a litany of all the evils old age has caused them. But I don’t think they
blame the real cause, Socrates. After all, if that were the cause, I too would
have had the same experiences, at least as far as old age is concerned, and so
would everyone else of my age. But as it is, I have met others in the past
who don’t feel that way—in particular, the poet Sophocles. I was once
present when he was asked by someone, “How are you as far as sex goes,
(c) Sophocles? Can you still make love to a woman?”“Quiet, man,” he replied,
“I am very glad to have escaped from all that, like a slave who has escaped
from a deranged and savage master.” I thought at the time what he said was
sensible, and I still do.You see, old age brings peace and freedom from all
such things. When the appetites cease to stress and importune us, every-
thing Sophocles said comes to pass, and we escape from many insane mas-
(d) ters. But in these matters, and in those concerning one’s relatives, the real
cause isn’t old age, Socrates, but the way people live. If they are orderly and
contented, old age, too, is only moderately onerous; if they aren’t, both old
age, Socrates, and youth are hard to bear.

> *I admired him for saying that, and I wanted him to tell me more, so I urged him on.*

I imagine when you say that, Cephalus, the masses[^7] do not accept it. On
(e)
the contrary, they think you bear old age more easily, not because of the
way you live, but because you are wealthy. For the wealthy, they say, have
many consolations.

CEPHALUS: That’s true, they are not convinced. And there is something in
their objection, though not as much as they think. Themistocles’ retort is
relevant here. When someone from Seriphus insulted him by saying his
(330a) high reputation was due to his city, not to himself, he replied that, had he
been a Seriphian, he would not be famous; but nor would the other, had
he been an Athenian.[^8] The same account applies to those who are not rich
and ﬁnd old age hard to bear: a good person would not easily bear old age
if it were coupled with poverty, but one who wasn’t good would not be at
peace with himself even if he were wealthy.

SOCRATES: Did you inherit most of your wealth, Cephalus, or did you
make it yourself?

CEPHALUS: What did I make for myself, Socrates, you ask. As a money-
(b) maker I am in between my grandfather and my father.You see, my grandfather and namesake inherited about the same amount of wealth as I possess
and multiplied it many times. However, my father, Lysanias, diminished
that amount to even less than I have now. As for me, I am satisﬁed to leave
my sons here no less, but a little more, than I inherited.

SOCRATES: The reason I asked is that you do not seem particularly to love
(c) money. And those who have not made it themselves are usually like that.

But those who have made it themselves love it twice as much as anyone
else. For just as poets love their poems and fathers their children, so those
who have made money take their money seriously both as something they
have made themselves and—just as other people do—because it is useful.

This makes them difﬁcult even to be with, since they are unwilling to
praise anything except money.

CEPHALUS: That’s true.
(d) SOCRATES: Indeed, it is. But tell me something else.What do you think is
the greatest good you have enjoyed as a result of being very wealthy?

CEPHALUS: What I have to say probably would not persuade the masses.

But you are well aware, Socrates, that when someone thinks his end is near,
he becomes frightened and concerned about things he did not fear before.

It is then that the stories told about Hades, that a person who has been
unjust here must pay the penalty there—stories he used to make fun of—
(e) twist his soul this way and that for fear they are true. And whether because
of the weakness of old age, or because he is now closer to what happens in
Hades and has a clearer view of it, or whatever it is, he is ﬁlled with foreboding and fear, and begins to calculate and consider whether he has been
unjust to anyone. If he ﬁnds many injustices in his life, he often even
awakes from sleep in terror, as children do, and lives in anticipation of evils
(331a) to come. But someone who knows he has not been unjust has sweet good
hope as his constant companion—a nurse to his old age, as Pindar says. For
(a) he puts it charmingly, Socrates, when he says that when someone lives
just and pious life,

> Sweet hope is in his heart\
> Nurse and companion to his age\
> Hope, captain of the ever-twisting\
> Mind of mortal men.

How amazingly well he puts that. It is in this connection I would say the
possession of wealth is most valuable, not for every man, but for a good and
(b) orderly one. Not cheating someone even unintentionally, not lying to him,
not owing a sacriﬁce to some god or money to a person, and as a result
departing for that other place in fear—the possession of wealth makes no
small contribution to this. It has many other uses, too, but putting one
thing against the other, Socrates, I would say that for a man with any sense,
that is how wealth is most useful.

SOCRATES: A ﬁne sentiment, Cephalus. But speaking of that thing itself,
justice,[^9] are we to say it is simply speaking the truth and paying whatever
(c)
debts one has incurred? Or is it sometimes just to do these things, some-
times unjust? I mean this sort of thing, for example: everyone would surely
agree that if a man borrows weapons from a sane friend, and if he goes mad
and asks for them back, the friend should not return them, and would not
be just if he did. Nor should anyone be willing to tell the whole truth to
someone in such a state.
(d) CEPHALUS: That’s true.

SOCRATES: Then the following is not the deﬁnition of justice: to speak
the truth and repay what one has borrowed.

> *Polemarchus interrupted:*
It certainly is, Socrates, if indeed we are to trust Simonides at all.

CEPHALUS: Well, then, I will hand over the discussion to you, since it is
time for me to look after the sacriﬁces.

POLEMARCHUS: Am I, Polemarchus, not heir of all your possessions?

> *Cephalus replied with a laugh:*
Certainly.

> *And off he went to the sacriﬁce.*
(e) SOCRATES: Then tell us, heir to the discussion, just what Simonides said
about justice that you think is correct.

POLEMARCHUS: He said it is just to give to each what is owed to him.And
(a) ﬁne saying it is, in my view.

SOCRATES: Well, now, it is not easy to disagree with Simonides, since he is
(a) wise and godlike man. But what exactly does he mean? Perhaps you
know, Polemarchus, but I do not understand. Clearly, he does not mean
what we said a moment ago—namely, giving back to someone whatever he
has lent to you, even if he is out of his mind when he asks for it. And yet
(332a) what he has lent to you is surely something that is owed to him, isn’t it?

POLEMARCHUS: Yes.

SOCRATES: But when he is out of his mind, it is, under no circumstances,
to be given to him?

POLEMARCHUS: True.

SOCRATES: Then it seems Simonides must have meant something else
when he says that to return what is owed is just.

POLEMARCHUS: Something else indeed, by Zeus! He meant friends owe
something good to their friends, never something bad.

SOCRATES: I understand.You mean someone does not give a lender what
he is owed by giving him gold, when the giving and taking would be
(b) harmful, and both he and the lender are friends. Isn’t that what you say
Simonides meant?

POLEMARCHUS: It certainly is.

SOCRATES: Now what about this? Should one also give to one’s enemies
whatever is owed to them?

POLEMARCHUS: Yes, by all means.What is in fact owed to them. And what
an enemy owes an enemy, in my view, is also precisely what is appropri-
ate—something bad.
(a) SOCRATES: It seems, then, Simonides was speaking in riddles—just like
(c) poet!—when he said what justice is. For what he meant, it seems, is that it
is just to give to each what is appropriate to him, and this is what he called
giving him what he is owed.

POLEMARCHUS: What else did you think he meant?

SOCRATES: Then what, in the name of Zeus, do you think he would
answer if someone asked him:“Simonides, what owed or appropriate things
does the craft[^10] we call medicine give, and to which things?”

POLEMARCHUS: Clearly, he would say it gives drugs, food, and drink to bodies.

SOCRATES: And what owed or appropriate things does the craft we call
cooking give, and to which things?
(d) POLEMARCHUS: It gives pleasant ﬂavors to food.

SOCRATES: Good. Now what does the craft we would call justice give,
and to whom or what does it give it?

POLEMARCHUS: If we are to follow the previous answers, Socrates, it gives
beneﬁt to friends and harm to enemies.

SOCRATES: Does Simonides mean, then, that treating friends well and
enemies badly is justice?

POLEMARCHUS: I believe so.

SOCRATES: And who is most capable of treating sick friends well and ene-
mies badly in matters of disease and health?

POLEMARCHUS: A doctor.
(e) SOCRATES: And who can do so best in a storm at sea?

POLEMARCHUS: A ship’s captain.[^11]
SOCRATES: What about the just person? In what actions and what work is
he most capable of beneﬁting friends and harming enemies?

POLEMARCHUS: In wars and alliances, I imagine.

SOCRATES: All right. Now when people are not sick, Polemarchus, a doc-
tor is useless to them.

POLEMARCHUS: True.

SOCRATES: And so is a ship’s captain to those who are not sailing?

POLEMARCHUS: Yes.

SOCRATES: So to people who are not at war, a just man is useless?

POLEMARCHUS: No, I don’t think that at all.

SOCRATES: So justice is also useful in peacetime?
(333a) POLEMARCHUS: Yes, it is useful.

SOCRATES: And so is farming, isn’t it?

POLEMARCHUS: Yes.

SOCRATES: For providing produce?

POLEMARCHUS: Yes.

SOCRATES: And shoemaking as well, of course?

POLEMARCHUS: Yes.

SOCRATES: For the acquisition of shoes, I suppose you would say?

POLEMARCHUS: Of course.

SOCRATES: Tell me, then, what is justice useful for using or acquiring in
peacetime?

POLEMARCHUS: Contracts, Socrates.

SOCRATES: And by contracts you mean partnerships, or what?

POLEMARCHUS: Partnerships, of course.
(b) SOCRATES: So is it a just man who is a good and useful partner in a game
of checkers, or an expert checkers player?

POLEMARCHUS: An expert checkers player.

SOCRATES: And in laying bricks and stones, is a just person a better and
more useful partner than a builder?

POLEMARCHUS: Not at all.

SOCRATES: Well, in what kind of partnership, then, is a just person a bet-
ter partner than a builder or a lyre player, in the way a lyre player is better
than a just person at hitting the right notes?

POLEMARCHUS: In money matters, I think.

SOCRATES: Except, I presume, Polemarchus, in using money.You see,
whenever one needs to buy or sell a horse jointly, I think a horse breeder is
(c) a more useful partner. Isn’t he?

POLEMARCHUS: Apparently.

SOCRATES: And when it is a boat, a boat builder or a ship’s captain?

POLEMARCHUS: It would seem so.

SOCRATES: In what joint use of silver or gold, then, is a just person a more
useful partner than anyone else?

POLEMARCHUS: When yours must be deposited for safekeeping, Socrates.

SOCRATES: You mean whenever there is no need to use it, but only to
keep it?

POLEMARCHUS: Of course.

SOCRATES: So when money is not being used, that is when justice is use-
(d) ful for it?

POLEMARCHUS: It looks that way.

SOCRATES: And when one needs to keep a pruning knife safe, justice is
useful both in partnerships and for the individual.When you need to use it,
however, it is the craft of vine pruning that is useful?

POLEMARCHUS: Apparently.

SOCRATES: And would you also say that when one needs to keep a shield
and a lyre safe and not use them, justice is a useful thing, but when you
need to use them it is the soldier’s craft or the musician’s that is useful?

POLEMARCHUS: I would have to.

SOCRATES: And so in all other cases, too, justice is useless when they are
in use, but useful when they are not?

POLEMARCHUS: It looks that way.
(e) SOCRATES: Then justice cannot be something excellent, can it, my friend,
if it is only useful for useless things. But let’s consider the following point.

Isn’t the person who is cleverest at landing a blow, whether in boxing or
any other kind of ﬁght, also cleverest at guarding against it?

POLEMARCHUS: Of course.

SOCRATES: And the one who is clever at guarding against disease is also
cleverest at producing it unnoticed?

POLEMARCHUS: That is my view, at any rate.
(334a) SOCRATES: And the one who is a good guardian of an army is the very
one who can steal the enemy’s plans and dispositions?

POLEMARCHUS: Of course.

SOCRATES: So whenever someone is a clever guardian of something, he is
also clever at stealing it.

POLEMARCHUS: It seems so.

SOCRATES: So if a just person is clever at guarding money, he must also be
clever at stealing it.

POLEMARCHUS: So the argument suggests, at least.

SOCRATES: It seems, then, that a just person has turned out to be a kind of
thief.You probably got that idea from Homer. For he loves Autolycus, the
(b) maternal grandfather of Odysseus, whom he describes as better than every-
one at stealing and swearing false oaths.[^12] According to you, Homer, and
Simonides, then, justice seems to be some sort of craft of stealing—one that
beneﬁts friends and harms enemies. Isn’t that what you meant?

POLEMARCHUS: No, by Zeus, it isn’t. But I do not know anymore what I
meant. I still believe this, however, that beneﬁting one’s friends and harm-
ing one’s enemies is justice.
(c) SOCRATES: Speaking of friends, do you mean those a person believes to be
good and useful, or those who actually are good and useful, even if he does
not believe they are, and similarly with enemies?

POLEMARCHUS: Probably, one loves those one considers good and useful
and hates those one considers bad.

SOCRATES: But don’t people make mistakes about this, so that lots of those
who seem to them to be good and useful aren’t, and vice versa?

POLEMARCHUS: They do.

SOCRATES: So, for them, good people are enemies and bad ones friends?

POLEMARCHUS: Of course.

SOCRATES: All the same, it is then just for them to beneﬁt bad people and
(d) harm good ones?

POLEMARCHUS: Apparently.

SOCRATES: Yet good people are just and are not the sort to do injustice.

POLEMARCHUS: True.

SOCRATES: According to your account, then, it is just to do bad things to
those who do no injustice.

POLEMARCHUS: Not at all, Socrates. It is my account that seems to be bad.

SOCRATES: It is just, then, is it, to harm unjust people and beneﬁt just
ones?

POLEMARCHUS: That seems better than the other view.

SOCRATES: Then it follows, Polemarchus, that it is just for many people—
(e) the ones who are mistaken in their judgment—to harm their friends, since
they are bad for them, and beneﬁt their enemies, since they are good. And
so we will ﬁnd ourselves claiming the very opposite of what we said Simo-
nides meant.

POLEMARCHUS: Yes, that certainly follows. But let’s change our deﬁnition.

For it looks as though we did not deﬁne friends and enemies correctly.

SOCRATES: How did we deﬁne them, Polemarchus?

POLEMARCHUS: We said that a friend is someone who is believed to be
good.

SOCRATES: And how are we to change that now?

POLEMARCHUS: Someone who is both believed to be good and is good is
(a) a friend; someone who is believed to be good, but is not, is believed to be
(335a) friend but is not. And the same goes for enemies.
(a) SOCRATES: According to that account, then, a good person will be
friend and a bad one an enemy.

POLEMARCHUS: Yes.

SOCRATES: So you want us to add something to what we said before about
the just man. Then we said that it is just to treat friends well and enemies
badly. Now you want us to add to this: to treat a friend well, provided he is
good, and to harm an enemy, provided he is bad?
(b) POLEMARCHUS: Yes, that seems well put to me.

SOCRATES: Should a just man really harm anyone whatsoever?

POLEMARCHUS: Of course. He should harm those who are both bad and
enemies.

SOCRATES: When horses are harmed, do they become better or worse?

POLEMARCHUS: Worse.

SOCRATES: With respect to the virtue[^13] that makes dogs good, or to the
one that makes horses good?

POLEMARCHUS: With respect to the one that makes horses good.

SOCRATES: And when dogs are harmed, they become worse with respect
to the virtue that makes dogs, not horses, good?

POLEMARCHUS: Necessarily.

SOCRATES: And what about human beings, comrade; shouldn’t we say that,
(c) when they are harmed, they become worse with respect to human virtue?

POLEMARCHUS: Of course.

SOCRATES: But isn’t justice human virtue?

POLEMARCHUS: Yes, that’s necessarily so, too.

SOCRATES: Then, my dear Polemarchus, people who have been harmed
are bound to become more unjust.

POLEMARCHUS: So it seems.

SOCRATES: Now, can musicians use music to make people unmusical?

POLEMARCHUS: No, they can’t.

SOCRATES: Or can horsemen use horsemanship to make people unhorse-
manlike?

POLEMARCHUS: No.

SOCRATES: Well, then, can just people use justice to make people unjust?

In a word, can good people use their virtue or goodness to make people
(d) bad?

POLEMARCHUS: No, they can’t.

SOCRATES: For it isn’t the function of heat to cool things down, I imag-
ine, but that of its opposite.

POLEMARCHUS: Yes.

SOCRATES: Nor the function of dryness to make things wet, but that of its
opposite.

POLEMARCHUS: Of course.

SOCRATES: So the function of a good person isn’t to harm, but that of his
opposite.

POLEMARCHUS: Apparently.

SOCRATES: And a just person is a good person?

POLEMARCHUS: Of course.

SOCRATES: So it isn’t the function of a just person to harm a friend or
anyone else, Polemarchus, but that of his opposite, an unjust person.

POLEMARCHUS: I think you are absolutely right, Socrates.
(e) SOCRATES: So if someone tells us it is just to give to each what he is owed,
and understands by this that a just man should harm his enemies and bene-
ﬁt his friends, the one who says it is not wise. I mean, what he says is not
true. For it has become clear to us that it is never just to harm anyone.

POLEMARCHUS: I agree.

SOCRATES: You and I will ﬁght as partners, then, against anyone who tells
us that Simonides, Bias, Pittacus, or any of our other wise and blessedly
happy men said this.

POLEMARCHUS: I, for my part, am willing to be your partner in the battle.
(336a) SOCRATES: Do you know whose saying I think it is, that it is just to bene-
ﬁt friends and harm enemies?

POLEMARCHUS: Whose?

SOCRATES: I think it is a saying of Periander, or Perdiccas, or Xerxes, or
Ismenias of Thebes, or some other wealthy man who thought he had great
power.

POLEMARCHUS: That’s absolutely true.

SOCRATES: All right. Since it has become apparent, then, that neither jus-
tice nor the just consists in beneﬁting friends and harming enemies, what
else should one say it is?

> *Now, while we were speaking,Thrasymachus had tried many times to take (b) over the discussion but was restrained by those sitting near him, who wanted to hear our argument to the end.When we paused after what I had just said, however, he could not keep quiet any longer: crouched up like a wild beast about to spring, he hurled himself at us as if to tear us to pieces. Polemarchus and I were frightened and ﬂustered as he roared into our midst:*

What nonsense you two have been talking all this time, Socrates! Why do
(c) you act like naïve people, giving way to one another? If you really want to
know what justice is, don’t just ask questions and then indulge your love of
honor by refuting the answers.You know very well it is easier to ask ques-
tions than to answer them. Give an answer yourself and tell us what you say
(d) the just is. And don’t tell me it is the right, the beneﬁcial, the proﬁtable, the
gainful, or the advantageous, but tell me clearly and exactly what you
mean. For I won’t accept such nonsense from you.

> *His words startled me and, looking at him, I was afraid. And I think if I had not seen him before he looked at me, I would have been dumbstruck.[^14] But as it was, I happened to look at him just as he began to be exasperated by our argument, so I was able to answer; and trembling a little, I said:*

Do not be too hard on us, Thrasymachus. If Polemarchus and I made an
error in our investigation of the accounts, you may be sure we did so invol-
untarily. If we were searching for gold, we would never voluntarily give
way to each other, if by doing so we would destroy our chance of ﬁnding
it. So do not think that in searching for justice, a thing more honorable
than a large quantity of gold, we would foolishly give way to one another
or be less than completely serious about ﬁnding it.You surely must not
think that, my friend, but rather—as I do—that we are incapable of ﬁnding
it. Hence it is surely far more appropriate for us to be pitied by you clever
(337a) people than to be given rough treatment.

> *When he heard that, he gave a loud sarcastic laugh:*

By Heracles! That is Socrates’ usual irony[^15] for you! I knew this would hap-
pen. I even told these others earlier that you would be unwilling to answer,
that you would be ironic and do anything rather than give an answer, if
someone questioned you.

SOCRATES: That is because you are a wise fellow, Thrasymachus.You
knew very well if you ask someone how much twelve is, and in putting the
(b) question you warn him, “Don’t tell me, man, that twelve is twice six, or
three times four, or six times two, or four times three; for I won’t accept
such nonsense from you”—it was obvious to you, I imagine, that no one
could respond to a person who inquired in that way. But suppose he said to
you: “What do you mean, Thrasymachus; am I not to give any of the
answers you mention, not even if twelve happens to be one of those things?

You are amazing. Do you want me to say something other than the truth?
(c) Or do you mean something else?”What answer would you give him?

THRASYMACHUS: Well, so you think the two cases are alike?

SOCRATES: Why shouldn’t I? But even if they are not alike, yet seem so to
the person you asked, do you think he is any less likely to give the answer
that seems right to him, whether we forbid him to do so or not?

THRASYMACHUS: Is that what you are going to do, give one of the forbid-
den answers?

SOCRATES: I would not be surprised—provided it is the one that seems
right to me after I have investigated the matter.

THRASYMACHUS: What if I show you another answer about justice, one
(d) that is different from all these and better than any of them? What penalty
would you deserve then?

SOCRATES: The very one that is appropriate for someone who does not
know—what else? And what is appropriate is to learn from the one who
does know.That, therefore, is what I deserve to suffer.

THRASYMACHUS: What a pleasant fellow you are! But in addition to
learning, you must pay money.

SOCRATES: I will if I ever have any.

GLAUCON: He has it already. If it is a matter of money, speak, Thrasyma-
chus.We will all contribute for Socrates.

THRASYMACHUS: Oh yes, sure, so that Socrates can carry on as usual: he
(e) gives no answer himself, and if someone else does, he takes up his account
and refutes it.

SOCRATES: How can someone give an answer, my excellent man, when,
ﬁrst of all, he does not know and does not claim to know, and then, even if
he does have some opinion about the matter, is forbidden by no ordinary
man to express any of the things he thinks? No, it is much more appropri-
(338a) ate for you to answer, since you say you do know and can tell us. Don’t be
obstinate. Give your answer as a favor to me and do not begrudge your
teaching to Glaucon and the others.

> *While I was saying this, Glaucon and the others begged him to do as I asked. Thrasymachus clearly wanted to speak in order to win a good reputation, since he thought he had a very good answer. But he pretended to want to win a victory at my expense by having me do the answering. However, he agreed in the end, and then said:*
(b) That is Socrates’ wisdom for you: he himself isn’t willing to teach but goes
around learning from others and isn’t even grateful to them.

SOCRATES: When you say I learn from others, you are right, Thrasyma-
chus; but when you say I do not give thanks, you are wrong. I give as much

as I can. But I can give only praise, since I have no money. And just how
enthusiastically I give it, when someone seems to me to speak well, you
will know as soon as you have answered, since I think you will speak well.

THRASYMACHUS: Listen, then. I say justice is nothing other than what is
(c) advantageous for the stronger.Well, why don’t you praise me? No, you are
unwilling.

SOCRATES: First, I must understand what you mean. For, as things stand, I
do not. What is advantageous for the stronger, you say, is just. What on
earth do you mean,Thrasymachus? Surely you do not mean something like
this: Polydamas, the pancratist,[^16] is stronger than we are. Beef is advanta-
geous for his body. So, this food is also both advantageous and just for us
(d) who are weaker than he?

THRASYMACHUS: You disgust me, Socrates.You interpret my account in
the way that does it the most evil.

SOCRATES: That’s not it at all, my very good man; I only want you to
make your meaning clearer.
(a) THRASYMACHUS: Don’t you know, then, that some cities are ruled by
tyranny, some by a democracy, and some by an aristocracy?

SOCRATES: Of course I do.

THRASYMACHUS: And that what is stronger in each city is the ruling
element?

SOCRATES: Certainly.

THRASYMACHUS: And each type of rule makes laws that are advantageous
(e) for itself: democracy makes democratic ones, tyranny tyrannical ones, and
so on with the others. And by so legislating, each declares that what is just
for its subjects is what is advantageous for itself—the ruler—and it punishes
anyone who deviates from this as lawless and unjust.That, Socrates, is what
I say justice is, the same in all cities: what is advantageous for the established
(339a) rule. Since the established rule is surely stronger, anyone who does the
rational calculation correctly will conclude that the just is the same every-
where—what is advantageous for the stronger.

SOCRATES: Now I see what you mean.Whether it is true or not, I will try
to ﬁnd out. But you yourself have answered that what is just is what is
advantageous,Thrasymachus, whereas you forbade me to answer that.True,
you have added for the stronger to it.
(b) THRASYMACHUS: And I suppose you think that is an insigniﬁcant addition.

SOCRATES: It isn’t clear yet whether it is signiﬁcant. What is clear is that
we must investigate whether or not it is true. I agree that what is just is
something advantageous. But you add for the stronger. I do not know about
that.We will have to look into it.

THRASYMACHUS: Go ahead and look.

SOCRATES: That is just what I am going to do. Tell me, then, you also
claim, don’t you, that it is just to obey the rulers?

THRASYMACHUS: I do.
(c) SOCRATES: And are the rulers in each city infallible, or are they liable to
error?

THRASYMACHUS: No doubt, they are liable to error.

SOCRATES: So, when they attempt to make laws, they make some cor-
rectly, others incorrectly?

THRASYMACHUS: I suppose so.

SOCRATES: And a law is correct if it prescribes what is advantageous for
the rulers themselves, and incorrect if it prescribes what is disadvantageous
for them? Is that what you mean?

THRASYMACHUS: It is.

SOCRATES: And whatever laws the rulers make must be obeyed by their
subjects, and that is what is just?

THRASYMACHUS: Of course.

SOCRATES: According to your account, then, it isn’t only just to do what
(d) is advantageous for the stronger, but also the opposite: what is not advanta-
geous.

THRASYMACHUS: What is that you are saying?

SOCRATES: The same as you, I think. But let’s examine it more closely.

Haven’t we agreed that the rulers are sometimes in error as to what is best
for themselves when they give orders to their subjects, and yet that it is just
for their subjects to do whatever their rulers order? Wasn’t that agreed?

THRASYMACHUS: I suppose so.

SOCRATES: You will also have to suppose, then, that you have agreed that
(e) it is just to do what is disadvantageous for the rulers and those who are
stronger, whenever they unintentionally order what is bad for themselves.

But you say, too, that it is just for the others to obey the orders the rulers
gave.You are very wise,Thrasymachus, but doesn’t it necessarily follow that
it is just to do the opposite of what you said, since the weaker are then
ordered to do what is disadvantageous for the stronger?
(340a) POLEMARCHUS: By Zeus, Socrates, that’s absolutely clear.

> *And Clitophon interrupted:*

Of course it is, if you are to be his witness, at any rate.

POLEMARCHUS: Who needs a witness? Thrasymachus himself agrees that
the rulers sometimes issue orders that are bad for them, and that it is just for
the others to obey them.

CLITOPHON: That, Polemarchus, is because Thrasymachus maintained that
it is just to obey the orders of the rulers.

POLEMARCHUS: Yes, Clitophon, and he also maintained that what is
(b) advantageous for the stronger is just. And having maintained both princi-
ples, he went on to agree that the stronger sometimes order the weaker,
who are subject to them, to do things that are disadvantageous for the
stronger themselves. From these agreements it follows that what is advanta-
geous for the stronger is no more just than what is not advantageous.

CLITOPHON: But what he meant by what is advantageous for the stronger is
what the stronger believes to be advantageous for him.That is what he main-
tained the weaker must do, and that is what he maintained is what is just.

POLEMARCHUS: But it is not what he said.

SOCRATES: It makes no difference, Polemarchus. If Thrasymachus wants
(c) to put it that way now, let’s accept it. But tell me, Thrasymachus, is that
what you intended to say, that what is just is what the stronger believes to
be advantageous for him, whether it is in fact advantageous for him or not?

Is that what we are to say you mean?

THRASYMACHUS: Not at all. Do you think I would call someone who is
in error stronger at the very moment he errs?

SOCRATES: I did think you meant that, when you agreed that the rulers
are not infallible but sometimes make errors.

THRASYMACHUS: That is because you are a quibbler in arguments,
(d) Socrates. I mean, when someone makes an error in the treatment of
patients, do you call him a doctor in virtue of the fact that he made that
very error? Or, when someone makes an error in calculating, do you call
him an accountant in virtue of the fact that he made that very error in cal-
culation? I think we express ourselves in words that, taken literally, do say
that a doctor is in error, or an accountant, or a grammarian. But each of
(e) these, to the extent that he is what we call him, never makes errors, so that,
according to the precise account (and you are a stickler for precise
accounts), no craftsman ever makes errors. It is when his knowledge fails
him that he makes an error, and, in virtue of the fact that he made that
error, he is no craftsman. No craftsman, wise man, or ruler makes an error
(a) at the moment when he is ruling, even though everyone will say that
physician or a ruler makes errors. It is in this loose way that you must also
take the answer I gave just now. But the most precise answer is this: a ruler,

(341a) to the extent that he is a ruler, never makes errors and unerringly decrees
what is best for himself, and that is what his subject must do.Thus, as I said
from the ﬁrst, it is just to do what is advantageous for the stronger.

SOCRATES: Well,Thrasymachus, so you think I quibble, do you?

THRASYMACHUS: Yes, I do.

SOCRATES: And you think that I asked the questions I did in a premedi-
tated attempt to do you evil in the argument?

THRASYMACHUS: I am certain of it. But it won’t do you any good.You
(b) will never be able to do me evil by covert means, and without them, you
will never be able to overpower me by argument.

SOCRATES: Bless you,Thrasymachus; I would not so much as try! But to
prevent this sort of confusion from happening to us again, would you
deﬁne whether you mean the ruler and stronger in the ordinary sense or in
what you were just now calling the precise sense, when you say that it is just
for the weaker to do what is advantageous for him, since he is the stronger?

THRASYMACHUS: I mean the ruler in the most precise sense. Now do that
evil, if you can, and practice your quibbling on it—I ask no favors. But you
will ﬁnd there is nothing you can do.

SOCRATES: Do you think that I am crazy enough to try to shave a lion[^17]
(c) and quibble with Thrasymachus?
(a) THRASYMACHUS: Well, you certainly tried just now, although you were
good-for-nothing at it, too!

SOCRATES: That’s enough of that! Tell me: is a doctor—in the precise
sense, the one you mentioned before—a moneymaker or someone who
treats the sick? Tell me about the one who is really a doctor.

THRASYMACHUS: Someone who treats the sick.

SOCRATES: What about a ship’s captain? Is the true captain a ruler of sailors, or a sailor?

THRASYMACHUS: A ruler of sailors.

SOCRATES: In other words, we should not take any account of the fact
(d) that he sails in a ship, and he should not be called a sailor for that reason.

For it is not because he is sailing that he is called a ship’s captain, but
because of the craft he practices and his rule over sailors?

THRASYMACHUS: True.

SOCRATES: And is there something that is advantageous for each of these?[^18]

THRASYMACHUS: Certainly.

SOCRATES: And isn’t it also the case that the natural aim of the craft is to
consider and provide what is advantageous for each?

THRASYMACHUS: Yes, that is its aim.

SOCRATES: And is anything advantageous for each of the crafts themselves
besides being as perfect as possible?
(e) THRASYMACHUS: How do you mean?

SOCRATES: It is like this: suppose you asked me whether it is satisfactory
for a body to be a body, or whether it needs something else. I would
answer, “Of course it needs something. In fact, that is why the craft of
medicine has been discovered—because a body is deﬁcient and it is not sat-
isfactory for it to be like that.[^19] To provide what is advantageous, that is

what the craft was developed for.” Do you think I am speaking correctly in
saying this, or not?

THRASYMACHUS: Correctly.

SOCRATES: What about medicine itself? Is it deﬁcient? Does a craft need
(342a) some further virtue, as the eyes are in need of sight and the ears of hearing,
so that another craft is needed to consider and provide what is advantageous
for them?[^20] Does a craft have some similar deﬁciency itself, so that each
craft needs another to consider what is advantageous for it? And does the
craft that does the considering need still another, and so on without end?

Or does each consider by itself what is advantageous for it? Does it need
(b) neither itself nor another craft to consider what—in light of its own deﬁ-
ciency—is advantageous for it? Indeed, is there no deﬁciency or error in
any craft? And is it inappropriate for any craft to consider what is advanta-
geous for anything besides that with which it deals? And since it is itself
correct, is it without fault or impurity so long as it is wholly and precisely
the craft it is? Consider this with that precision of language you mentioned.

Is it so or not?

THRASYMACHUS: It appears to be so.

SOCRATES: Doesn’t it follow that medicine does not consider what is
(c) advantageous for medicine, but for the body?

THRASYMACHUS: Yes.

SOCRATES: And horse breeding does not consider what is advantageous
for horse breeding, but for horses? Indeed, no other craft considers what is
advantageous for itself—since it has no further needs—but what is advanta-
geous for that with which it deals?

THRASYMACHUS: Apparently so.

SOCRATES: Now surely,Thrasymachus, the various crafts rule over and are
stronger than that with which they deal?

> *He gave in at this point as well, very reluctantly.*

SOCRATES: So no kind of knowledge considers or enjoins what is advan-
tageous for itself, but what is advantageous for the weaker, which is subject
(d) to it.

> *He ﬁnally agreed to this too, although he tried to ﬁght it. When he had agreed, however, I said:*

Surely then, no doctor, to the extent that he is a doctor, considers or
enjoins what is advantageous for himself, but what is advantageous for his
patient? For we agreed that a doctor, in the precise sense, is a ruler of bod-
ies, not a moneymaker. Isn’t that what we agreed?

THRASYMACHUS: Yes.

SOCRATES: So a ship’s captain, in the precise sense, is a ruler of sailors, not
a sailor?
(e) THRASYMACHUS: That is what we agreed.

SOCRATES: Doesn’t it follow that a ship’s captain and ruler won’t consider
and enjoin what is advantageous for a captain, but what is advantageous for
(a) sailor and his subject?

> *He reluctantly agreed.*
SOCRATES: So then,Thrasymachus, no one in any position of rule, to the
extent that he is a ruler, considers or enjoins what is advantageous for him-
self, but what is advantageous for his subject—that on which he practices
his craft. It is to his subject and what is advantageous and proper for it that
he looks, and everything he says and does, he says and does for it.

> *(343a) When we reached this point in the argument and it was clear to all that his account of justice had turned into its opposite, instead of answering,Thrasymachus said:*

Tell me, Socrates, do you still have a wet nurse?

SOCRATES: What is that? Shouldn’t you be giving answers rather than ask-
ing such things?

THRASYMACHUS: Because she is letting you run around sniveling and
doesn’t wipe your nose when you need it, since it is her fault that you do
not know the difference between sheep and shepherds.

SOCRATES: What exactly is it I do not know?
(b) THRASYMACHUS: You think that shepherds and cowherds consider what is
good for their sheep and cattle, and fatten them and take care of them with
some aim in mind other than what is good for their master and themselves.

Moreover, you believe that rulers in cities—true rulers, that is—think
about their subjects in a different way than one does about sheep, and that
what they consider night and day is something other than what is advanta-
(c) geous for themselves.You are so far from understanding justice and what is
just, and injustice and what is unjust, that you do not realize that justice is
really the good of another, what is advantageous for the stronger and the
ruler, and harmful to the one who obeys and serves. Injustice is the oppo-
site, it rules those simpleminded—for that is what they really are—just peo-
ple, and the ones it rules do what is advantageous for the other who is
stronger; and they make the one they serve happy, but they do not make
themselves the least bit happy.

(d) You must consider it as follows, Socrates, or you will be the most naïve
of all: a just man must always get less than does an unjust one. First, in
their contracts with one another, when a just man is partner to an unjust,
you will never ﬁnd, when the partnership ends, that the just one gets
more than the unjust, but less. Second, in matters relating to the city,
when taxes are to be paid, a just man pays more on an equal amount of
property, an unjust one less; but when the city is giving out refunds, a just
man gets nothing while an unjust one makes a large proﬁt. Finally, when
(e) each of them holds political ofﬁce, a just person—even if he is not penal-
ized in other ways—ﬁnds that his private affairs deteriorate more because
he has to neglect them, that he gains no advantage from the public purse
because of his justice, and that he is hated by his relatives and acquaintan-
ces because he is unwilling to do them an unjust favor. The opposite is
true of an unjust man in every respect. I mean, of course, the person I
described before: the man of great power who does better[^21] than everyone
(344a) else. He is the one you should consider if you want to ﬁgure out how
much more advantageous it is for the individual to be unjust than just.You
will understand this most easily if you turn your thoughts to injustice of
the most complete sort, the sort that makes those who do injustice happi-
est, and those who suffer it—those who are unwilling to do injustice—
most wretched. The sort I mean is tyranny, because it uses both covert
means and force to appropriate the property of others—whether it is
sacred or secular, public or private—not little by little, but all at once. If
(b) someone commits a part of this sort of injustice and gets caught, he is
punished and greatly reproached—temple robbers,[^22] kidnappers, house-
breakers, robbers, and thieves are what these partly unjust people are
called when they commit those harms. When someone appropriates the
possessions of the citizens, on the other hand, and then kidnaps and
enslaves the possessors as well, instead of these shameful names he is called
(c) happy and blessed: not only by the citizens themselves, but even by all
who learn that he has committed the whole of injustice. For it is not the
fear of doing injustice, but of suffering it, that elicits the reproaches of
those who revile injustice.

So you see, Socrates, injustice, if it is on a large enough scale, is stronger,
freer, and more masterful than justice. And, as I said from the beginning,
justice is what is advantageous for the stronger, while injustice is proﬁtable
and advantageous for oneself.

> *(d) Having, like a bath attendant, emptied this great ﬂood of words into our ears all at once, Thrasymachus was thinking of leaving. But those present wouldn’t let him. They made him stay and give an account of what he had said. And I myself was particularly insistent:*

You are marvelous, Thrasymachus; after hurling such a speech at us, you
surely cannot be thinking of leaving before you have adequately instructed
us—or learned yourself—whether you are right or not. Or do you think it
(e) is a trivial matter you are trying to determine, and not rather a way of
life—the one that would make living life that way most proﬁtable for each
of us?

THRASYMACHUS: Do you mean that I do not think it is a serious matter?

SOCRATES: Either that, or you care nothing for us and so are not worried
about whether we will live better or worse lives because of our ignorance
of what you claim to know. No, be a good fellow and show some willing-
ness to teach us—you won’t do badly for yourself if you help a group as
(345a) large as ours. For my own part, I will tell you that I am not persuaded. I do
not believe that injustice is more proﬁtable than justice, not even if you
should give it full scope to do what it wants. Suppose, my good fellow, that
there is an unjust person, and suppose he does have the power to do injus-
tice, whether by covert means or open warfare; nonetheless, he does not
persuade me that injustice is more proﬁtable than justice. Perhaps someone
(b) here besides myself feels the same as I do. So, blessed though you are, you
are going to have to fully persuade us that we are wrong to value justice
more highly than injustice in deliberating.

THRASYMACHUS: And how am I to persuade you? If you are not per-
suaded by what I said just now, what more can I do? Am I to take my argu-
ment and pour it into your very soul?

SOCRATES: No, by Zeus, do not do that! But ﬁrst, stick to what you have
said, or, if you change your position, do it openly and do not try to deceive
us.You see, Thrasymachus, having deﬁned the true doctor—to continue
(c) examining the things you said before—you did not consider it necessary to
maintain the same level of exactness when you later turned to the true
shepherd.You do not think a shepherd—to the extent that he is a shep-
herd—fattens sheep with the aim of doing what is best for them. But you
think that, like a guest about to be entertained at a feast, his aim is to eat
(a) well or to make a future sale—as if he were a moneymaker rather than
(d) shepherd. But of course, the only concern of the craft of shepherding is to
provide what is best for that with which it deals, since it itself is adequately
provided with all it needs to be at its best, as we know, when it does not fall
short in any way of being the craft of shepherding. That is why I, at any
rate, thought it necessary for us to agree before[^23] that every kind of rule—
to the extent that it is a kind of rule—does not seek anything other than
what is best for the thing it rules and cares for, and this is true both in polit-
(e) ical and in private rule. But do you think that those who rule cities—the
ones who are truly rulers—rule willingly?

THRASYMACHUS: I do not think it, by Zeus, I know it.

SOCRATES: But, Thrasymachus, don’t you realize that in other kinds of
rule there is no willing ruler? On the contrary, they demand to be paid on
the assumption that their ruling will beneﬁt not themselves, but their sub-
(346a) jects. For tell me, don’t we say that each craft differs from every other in
what it is capable of doing? Blessed though you are, please don’t answer
contrary to your belief, so that we can come to some deﬁnite conclusion.

THRASYMACHUS: Yes, that is what differentiates them.

SOCRATES: And doesn’t each craft provide us with a particular beneﬁt, dif-
ferent from the others? For example, medicine provides us with health,
captaincy with safety at sea, and so on with the others?

THRASYMACHUS: Certainly.

SOCRATES: And doesn’t wage-earning provide us with wages, since that is
(b) what it is capable of doing? Or would you call medicine the same craft as
captaincy? Indeed, if you want to deﬁne matters precisely, as you proposed,
even if someone who is a ship’s captain becomes healthy because what is
advantageous for him is sailing on the sea, you would not for that reason
call what he does medicine, would you?

THRASYMACHUS: Of course not.

SOCRATES: Nor would you call wage-earning medicine, even if someone
becomes healthy while earning wages?

THRASYMACHUS: Of course not.

SOCRATES: Nor would you call medicine wage-earning, even if someone
earns pay while healing?

(c) THRASYMACHUS: No.

SOCRATES: We are agreed then, aren’t we, that each craft brings its own
special beneﬁt?

THRASYMACHUS: Yes, we are.

SOCRATES: So whatever beneﬁt all craftsmen jointly receive must clearly
derive from their joint practice of some additional craft that is the same for
each of them.

THRASYMACHUS: It seems so.

SOCRATES: And we say that the additional craft in question, which bene-
ﬁts the craftsmen by earning them wages, is the craft of wage-earning?

> *He reluctantly agreed.*
SOCRATES: Then this very beneﬁt, receiving wages, is not provided to
(d) each of them by his own craft. On the contrary, if we are to examine the
(a) matter precisely, medicine provides health and wage-earning provides
wage; house-building provides a house, and wage-earning, which accom-
panies it, provides a wage; and so on with the other crafts. Each of them
does its own work and beneﬁts that with which it deals. So, wages aside, is
there any beneﬁt that craftsmen get from their craft?

THRASYMACHUS: Apparently not.

SOCRATES: But he still provides a beneﬁt, even when he works for
(e) nothing?

THRASYMACHUS: Yes, I think he does.

SOCRATES: Then, it is clear now, Thrasymachus, that no type of craft or
rule provides what is beneﬁcial for itself; but, as we have been saying for
some time, it provides and enjoins what is beneﬁcial for its subject, and
aims at what is advantageous for it—the weaker, not the stronger. That is
why I said just now, my dear Thrasymachus, that no one chooses to rule
voluntarily and take other people’s troubles in hand and straighten them
out, but each asks for wages.You see, anyone who is going to practice his
(347a) type of craft well never does or enjoins what is best for himself—at least not
when he is acting as his craft prescribes—but what is best for his subject. It

is because of this, it seems, that wages must be provided to a person if he is
going to be willing to rule, whether they are in the form of money or
honor or a penalty if he refuses.

GLAUCON: What do you mean, Socrates? I am familiar with the ﬁrst two
kinds of wages, but I do not understand what penalty you mean, or how
you can call it a wage.

SOCRATES: Then you do not understand the sort of wages for which the
best people rule, when they are willing to rule. Don’t you know that those
(b) who love honor and those who love money are despised, and rightly so?

GLAUCON: I do.

SOCRATES: Well, then, that is why good people won’t be willing to rule
for the sake of money or honor.You see, if they are paid wages openly for
ruling, they will be called hirelings, and if they take them covertly as the
fruits of their rule, they will be called thieves. On the other hand, they
won’t rule for the sake of honor either, since they are not ambitious honor-
(c) lovers. So, if they are going to be willing to rule, some compulsion or pun-
ishment must be brought to bear on them—that is probably why wanting
to rule when one does not have to is thought to be shameful. Now, the
greatest punishment for being unwilling to rule is being ruled by someone
worse than oneself. And I think it is fear of that that makes good people
rule when they do rule. They approach ruling, not as though they were
going to do something good or as though they were going to enjoy them-
selves in it, but as something necessary, since it cannot be entrusted to any-
(d) one better than—or even as good as—themselves. In a city of good men, if
it came into being, the citizens would ﬁght in order not to rule, just as they
now do in order to rule.There it would be quite clear that anyone who is
really and truly a ruler does not naturally seek what is advantageous for
himself, but what is so for his subject. As a result, anyone with any sense
would prefer to be beneﬁted by another than to go to the trouble of bene-
ﬁting him. So I cannot at all agree with Thrasymachus that justice is what is
(e) advantageous for the stronger. But we will look further into that another
time.What Thrasymachus is now saying—that the life of an unjust person is
better than that of a just one—seems to be of far greater importance.

Which life would you choose, Glaucon? And which of our views do you
think is closer to the truth?

GLAUCON: I think the life of a just person is more proﬁtable.
(a) SOCRATES: Did you hear all the good things Thrasymachus attributed
(348a) moment ago to the unjust man?

GLAUCON: I did, but I am not persuaded.

SOCRATES: Then do you want us to persuade him, if we can ﬁnd a way,
that what he says is not true?

GLAUCON: Of course I do.

SOCRATES: Well, if we oppose him with a speech parallel to his speech
enumerating in turn the many good things that come from being just, and
he replies, and then we do, we will have to count and measure the good
things mentioned on each side, and we will need a jury to decide the case.
(b) But if, on the other hand, we investigate the question, as we have been
doing, by seeking agreement with each other, we ourselves can be both
jury and advocates at once.

GLAUCON: Certainly.

SOCRATES: Then which approach do you prefer?

GLAUCON: The second.

SOCRATES: Come on then,Thrasymachus, answer us from the beginning.

You say, don’t you, that complete injustice is more proﬁtable than complete
justice?
(c) THRASYMACHUS: I certainly have said that. And I have told you why.

SOCRATES: Well, then, what do you say about this? Do you call one of the
two a virtue and the other a vice?

THRASYMACHUS: Of course.

SOCRATES: That is to say, you call justice a virtue and injustice a vice?

THRASYMACHUS: Is that likely, sweetest one, when I say that injustice is
proﬁtable and justice is not?

SOCRATES: Then what exactly do you say?

THRASYMACHUS: The opposite.

SOCRATES: That justice is a vice?

THRASYMACHUS: No, just very noble naiveté.[^24]
(d) SOCRATES: So you call injustice deviousness?

THRASYMACHUS: No, I call it being prudent.

SOCRATES: Do you also consider unjust people to be wise and good,
Thrasymachus?

THRASYMACHUS: Yes, if they do complete injustice and can bring cities
and whole nations under their power. Perhaps, you thought I meant
pickpockets? Not that such crimes aren’t also proﬁtable, if they are not
found out. But they are not worth discussing by comparison to what I
described.

Socrates takes him to mean it in the good sense of being straightforward, and so con-
trasts it with kakoêtheia—deviousness. See 400e1.

(e) SOCRATES: Yes, I am not unaware of what you mean. But this did surprise
me: that you include injustice with virtue and wisdom, and justice with
their opposites.

THRASYMACHUS: Nevertheless, that is where I put them.

SOCRATES: That is now a harder problem, comrade, and it is not easy to
know what to say in response. If you had declared that injustice is more prof-
itable, but agreed that it is a vice or shameful, as some others do, we could be
discussing the matter on the basis of conventional views. But now, obviously,
you will say that injustice is ﬁne and strong and apply to it all the attributes we
(349a) used to apply to justice, since you dare to include it with virtue and wisdom.

THRASYMACHUS: You have guessed my views exactly.

SOCRATES: All the same, we must not shrink from pursuing the argument
and looking into this, just as long as I take you to be saying what you really
think.You see, I believe that you really are not joking now,Thrasymachus,
but saying what you believe to be the truth.

THRASYMACHUS: What difference does it make to you, whether I believe
it or not? Isn’t it my account you are supposed to be refuting?

SOCRATES: It makes no difference. But here is a further question I would
(b) like you to try to answer: do you think that a just person wants to do bet-
ter[^25] than another just person?

THRASYMACHUS: Not at all. Otherwise, he would not be the civilized and
naïve person he actually is.

SOCRATES: What about than the just action?

THRASYMACHUS: No, not than that, either.

SOCRATES: And does he claim that he deserves to do better than an unjust
person and believe that it is just for him to do so, or doesn’t he believe that?

THRASYMACHUS: He would want to do better than him, and he would
claim to deserve to do so, but he would not be able.

SOCRATES: That is not what I am asking, but whether a just person wants,
(c) and claims to deserve, to do better than an unjust person, but not than a
just one?

THRASYMACHUS: He does.

SOCRATES: What about an unjust person? Does he claim that he deserves
to do better than a just person or a just action?

THRASYMACHUS: Of course he does; he thinks he deserves to do better
than everyone.

SOCRATES: Then will an unjust person also do better than an unjust person
or an unjust action, and will he strive to get the most he can for himself
from everyone?

THRASYMACHUS: He will.

SOCRATES: Then let’s put it this way: a just person does not do better than
someone like himself, but someone unlike himself, whereas an unjust per-
(d) son does better than those who are like and those who are unlike him.

THRASYMACHUS: Very well put.

SOCRATES: Now, an unjust person is wise and good, and a just one is neither?

THRASYMACHUS: That is well put, too.

SOCRATES: So isn’t an unjust person also like a wise and good person,
while the just person is not?

THRASYMACHUS: Of course. How could he fail to be like people who
have such qualities, when he has them himself? But the unjust person is not
like them.

SOCRATES: Fine.Then each of them has the qualities of the people he is like?

THRASYMACHUS: What else could he have?

SOCRATES: All right,Thrasymachus. Do you call one person musical and
(e) another non-musical?

THRASYMACHUS: I do.

SOCRATES: Which of them is wise in music and which is not?

THRASYMACHUS: The musical one is wise, presumably, and the other not
wise.

SOCRATES: And in the things in which he is wise, he is good; and in the
things in which he is not wise, he is bad?

THRASYMACHUS: Yes.

SOCRATES: Isn’t the same true of a doctor?

THRASYMACHUS: It is.

SOCRATES: Do you think, then,Thrasymachus, that a man who is a musician, when he is tuning his lyre and tightening and loosening the strings,
wants to do better than another musician, and does he claim that that is
what he deserves?[^26]

THRASYMACHUS: I do not.

SOCRATES: But he does want to do better than a non-musician? 15
THRASYMACHUS: Necessarily.
(350a) SOCRATES: What about a doctor? When he is prescribing food and drink,
does he want to do better than another doctor or than medical practice?

THRASYMACHUS: Certainly not.

SOCRATES: But he does want to do better than a non-doctor?

THRASYMACHUS: Yes.
(a) SOCRATES: In any branch of knowledge or ignorance, do you think that
knowledgeable person would intentionally try to take more for himself
than another knowledgeable person, or to do or say more, and not rather
exactly what the one like himself would do in the same situation?

THRASYMACHUS: No, I imagine it must be as you say.

SOCRATES: And what about an ignorant person? Doesn’t he want to do
(b) better than both a knowledgeable person and an ignorant one?

THRASYMACHUS: I suppose so.

SOCRATES: A knowledgeable person is wise?

THRASYMACHUS: I agree.

SOCRATES: And a wise one is good?

THRASYMACHUS: I agree.

SOCRATES: So, a good and wise person does not want to do better than
someone like himself, but someone both unlike and opposite to him.

THRASYMACHUS: So it seems.

SOCRATES: But a bad and ignorant person wants to do better than both his
like and his opposite.

THRASYMACHUS: Apparently.

SOCRATES: Well, Thrasymachus, we found that an unjust person tries to
do better than those like him and those unlike him. Didn’t you say that?

THRASYMACHUS: I did. 15
(c) SOCRATES: And that a just person won’t do better than those like him, but
those unlike him?

THRASYMACHUS: Yes.

SOCRATES: Then a just person is like a wise and good person, and an
unjust person is like an ignorant and bad one.

THRASYMACHUS: It looks that way.

SOCRATES: Moreover, we agreed that each has the qualities of the one he
resembles.

THRASYMACHUS: Yes, we did.

SOCRATES: A just person has turned out to be good and wise, then, and
an unjust one ignorant and bad.

> *(d) Thrasymachus agreed to all this, not easily as I am telling it, but reluctantly, with toil, trouble, and—since it was summer—a quantity of sweat that was amazing to behold. And then I saw something I had never seen before—Thrasymachus blushing. But in any case, after we had agreed that justice is virtue and wisdom and that injustice is vice and ignorance, I said:*

(a) All right, let’s take that as established. But we also said that injustice is
strong thing, or don’t you remember that,Thrasymachus?

THRASYMACHUS: I remember. But I am not satisﬁed with what you are
now saying. I could make a speech about it, but if I did, I know that you
would say I was engaging in demagoguery. So, either allow me to say as
(e) much as I want to say or, if you want to keep on asking questions, go ahead
and ask them, and I shall say to you—as one does to old women telling sto-
ries—“All right,” and nod or shake my head.

SOCRATES: No, don’t do that; not contrary to your own belief.

THRASYMACHUS: Then I will answer to please you, since you won’t let
me make a speech.What else do you want?

SOCRATES: Nothing, by Zeus. But if that is what you are going to do, do
it, and I will ask the questions.

THRASYMACHUS: Ask them, then.

SOCRATES: All right, I will ask precisely what I asked before, so that we
may proceed in an orderly fashion with our argument about what sort of
(351a) thing justice is, as opposed to injustice. For it was claimed, I believe, that
injustice is stronger and more powerful than justice. But now, if justice is
indeed wisdom and virtue, it will be easy to show, I suppose, that it is stron-
ger than injustice, since injustice is ignorance—no one could now be igno-
rant of that. However, I, at any rate, do not want to consider the matter in
such simple terms,Thrasymachus, but to look into it in some such way as
this: would you say that a city may be unjust and try to enslave other cities
unjustly, and succeed at enslaving them,[^27] and hold them in subjection
(b)
which it enslaved in the past?

THRASYMACHUS: Of course. And that is what the best city will especially
do, the one that is most completely unjust.

SOCRATES: I understand that that is your argument, but the point I want
to examine is this: will the city that becomes stronger than another achieve
this power without justice, or will it need the help of justice?
(c) THRASYMACHUS: If what you said a moment ago stands, and justice is
wisdom, it will need the help of justice; but if things are as I stated, it will
need the help of injustice.

SOCRATES: I am impressed, Thrasymachus, that you are not merely nod-
ding or shaking your head, but giving these ﬁne answers.

THRASYMACHUS: That is because I am trying to please you.

SOCRATES: You are doing well at it, too. So please me some more by
answering this question: do you think that a city, an army, a band of robbers
or thieves, or any other group with a common unjust purpose would be
able to achieve it if its members were unjust to each other?
(d) THRASYMACHUS: Of course not.

SOCRATES: What if they were not unjust to one another? Would they
achieve more?

THRASYMACHUS: Certainly.

SOCRATES: Because, Thrasymachus, injustice causes factions, hatreds, and
quarrels among them, while justice brings friendship and a sense of com-
mon purpose. Isn’t that so?

THRASYMACHUS: I will say it is, in order not to disagree with you.

SOCRATES: You are still doing well on that front, which is very good of
you. So tell me this: if the function of injustice is to produce hatred wher-
ever it occurs, then whenever it arises, whether among free men or slaves,
won’t it make them hate one another, form factions, and be unable to
(e) achieve any common purpose?

THRASYMACHUS: Of course.

SOCRATES: What if it arises between two people? Won’t they be at odds,
hate each other, and be enemies both to one another and to just people?

THRASYMACHUS: They will.

SOCRATES: Well, then, my amazing fellow, if injustice arises within a sin-
gle individual, will it lose its power or will it retain it undiminished?

THRASYMACHUS: Let’s say that it retains it undiminished.

SOCRATES: Apparently, then, its power is such that whenever it comes to
exist in something—whether in a city, a family, an army, or anything else
whatsoever—it makes that thing, ﬁrst of all, incapable of acting in concert
(352a) with itself, because of the faction and difference it creates; and, second of
all, an enemy to itself, and to what is in every way its opposite: namely, jus-
tice. Isn’t that so?

THRASYMACHUS: Of course.

SOCRATES: And in a single individual, too, I presume, it will produce the
very same effects that it is in its nature to produce. First, it will make him
incapable of acting because of inner faction and not being of one mind
with himself; second, it will make him his own enemy as well as the enemy
of just people. Isn’t that right?

THRASYMACHUS: Yes.

SOCRATES: But, my dear fellow, aren’t the gods also just?

THRASYMACHUS: Let’s say they are.

SOCRATES: Then an unjust person will also be an enemy of the gods,
(b) Thrasymachus, while a just person will be their friend?

THRASYMACHUS: Feast yourself conﬁdently on the argument! Don’t
worry, I won’t oppose you, so as not to arouse the enmity of our friends
here.

SOCRATES: Come on, then, complete the banquet for me by continuing
to answer as you have been doing now.We have shown that just people are
wiser and better and more capable of acting, while unjust ones are not even
(c) able to act together. For whenever we speak of men who are unjust acting
together to effectively achieve a common goal, what we say is not alto-
gether true.They would never have been able to keep their hands off each
other if they were completely unjust. But clearly there must have been
some sort of justice in them that at least prevented them from doing injus-
tice among themselves at the same time as they were doing it to others.

And it was this that enabled them to achieve what they did. When they
started doing unjust things, they were only halfway corrupted by their
injustice. For those who are wholly bad and completely unjust are also
completely incapable of acting. All this I now see to be the truth, and not
(d) what you ﬁrst maintained. However, we must now examine the question,
as we proposed to do before,[^28] of whether just people also live better and
are happier than unjust ones. I think it is clear even now from what we
have said that this is so, but we must consider it further. After all, the argu-
ment concerns no ordinary topic, but the way we ought to live.

THRASYMACHUS: Go ahead and consider.

SOCRATES: I will.Tell me, do you think there is such a thing as the func-
tion of a horse?
(e) THRASYMACHUS: I do.

SOCRATES: And would you take the function of a horse or of anything
else to be that which one can do only with it, or best with it?

THRASYMACHUS: I don’t understand.

SOCRATES: Let me put it this way: is it possible for you to see with any-
thing except eyes?

THRASYMACHUS: Certainly not.

SOCRATES: Or for you to hear with anything except ears?

THRASYMACHUS: No.

SOCRATES: Would it be right, then, for us to say that these things are their
functions?

THRASYMACHUS: Of course.

SOCRATES: Again, couldn’t you use a dagger, a carving knife, or lots of
(353a) other things in pruning a vine?

THRASYMACHUS: Certainly.

SOCRATES: But nothing would do a better job than a pruning knife
designed for the purpose?

THRASYMACHUS: That’s true.

SOCRATES: Shall we take pruning to be its function, then?

THRASYMACHUS: Yes.

SOCRATES: Now I think you will understand better what I was asking ear-
lier when I asked whether the function of each thing is what it alone can
do or what it can do better than anything else.

THRASYMACHUS: I do understand, and I think that that is the function of
(b) anything.

SOCRATES: All right. Does there seem to you also to be a virtue[^29] for each
thing to which some function is assigned? Let’s go over the same ground
again.We say that eyes have some function?

THRASYMACHUS: They do.

SOCRATES: So eyes also have a virtue?

THRASYMACHUS: They do.

SOCRATES: And ears have a function?

THRASYMACHUS: Yes.

SOCRATES: So they also have a virtue?

THRASYMACHUS: They have a virtue too.

SOCRATES: What about everything else? Doesn’t the same hold?

THRASYMACHUS: It does.

SOCRATES: Well, then. Could eyes perform their function well if they
(c) lacked their proper virtue but had the vice instead?

THRASYMACHUS: How could they? For don’t you mean if they had blind-
ness instead of sight?

SOCRATES: Whatever their virtue is.You see, I am not now asking about
that, but about whether it is by means of their own proper virtue that their
function performs the things it performs well, and by means of vice badly?

THRASYMACHUS: What you say is true.

SOCRATES: So, if ears are deprived of their own virtue, they too perform
their function badly?

THRASYMACHUS: Of course.
(d) SOCRATES: And the same argument applies to everything else?

THRASYMACHUS: So it seems to me, at least.

SOCRATES: Come on, then, and let’s next consider this: does the soul have
some function that you could not perform with anything else—for exam-
ple, taking care of things, ruling, deliberating, and all other such things? Is
there anything else besides a soul to which you could rightly assign these
and say that they special to it?

THRASYMACHUS: No, there is nothing else.
(a) SOCRATES: Then what about living? Don’t we say that it is a function of
soul?

THRASYMACHUS: Absolutely.

SOCRATES: And don’t we also say that a soul has a virtue?

THRASYMACHUS: We do.

SOCRATES: Will a soul ever perform its functions well, then, Thrasyma-
(e) chus, if it is deprived of its own proper virtue, or is that impossible?

THRASYMACHUS: It is impossible.

SOCRATES: It is necessary, then, that a bad soul rules and takes care of
things badly, and that a good soul does all these things well?

THRASYMACHUS: It is necessary.

SOCRATES: Now, didn’t we agree that justice is a soul’s virtue and injustice
its vice?

THRASYMACHUS: Yes, we did agree.

SOCRATES: So a just soul and a just man will live well and an unjust one
badly.

THRASYMACHUS: Apparently so, according to your argument.

SOCRATES: And surely anyone who lives well is blessed and happy, and
(354a) anyone who does not is the opposite.

THRASYMACHUS: Of course.

SOCRATES: Therefore, a just person is happy and an unjust one wretched.

THRASYMACHUS: Let’s say so.

SOCRATES: But surely it is proﬁtable, not to be wretched, but to be happy.

THRASYMACHUS: Of course.

SOCRATES: So then, blessed Thrasymachus, injustice is never more proﬁt-
able than justice.

THRASYMACHUS: Let that be your banquet, Socrates, at the feast of Bendis.

SOCRATES: Given by you, Thrasymachus, after you became gentle with
me and ceased to be difﬁcult.Yet I have not had a good banquet. But that is
(b) my fault, not yours. I seem to have behaved like those gluttons who snatch
at every dish that passes and taste it before having properly savored the pre-
ceding one. Before ﬁnding the ﬁrst thing we inquired about—namely,
what justice is—I let that go, and turned to investigate whether it is a kind
of vice and ignorance or a kind of wisdom and virtue.Then an argument
came up about injustice being more proﬁtable than justice, and I could not
refrain from abandoning the previous one and following up on it. Hence
the result of the discussion, so far as I am concerned, is that I know noth-
(c) ing. For when I do not know what justice is, I will hardly know whether it
is a kind of virtue or not, or whether a person who has it is happy or
unhappy.
