# *Book 4*
SOCRATES’ NARRATION CONTINUES: Adeimantus interrupted:
(419a) How will you defend yourself, Socrates, he said, if someone objects that
you are not making these men very happy and, furthermore, that it is their
own fault that they are not? I mean, the city really belongs to them, yet
they derive no good from the city. Others own land, build ﬁne, big houses,
acquire furnishings to go along with them, make their own private sacri-
ﬁces to the gods, entertain guests, and also, of course, possess what you
were talking about just now: gold and silver and all the things that those
who are going to be blessedly happy are thought to require. Instead of that,
he might say, they seem simply to be paid auxiliaries established in the city
(420a) as a garrison, and nothing else.

SOCRATES: Yes, and what is more, they do it just for upkeep and get no
wages in addition to their upkeep, as other men do. So, they won’t even be
able to take a personal trip out of town if they want to, or give presents to
their girlfriends, or spend money in whatever other ways they might wish,
as people do who are considered happy.You have omitted these and a host
of other similar facts from your list of charges.

ADEIMANTUS: Well, let them too be added to the charges.
(b) SOCRATES: How will we defend ourselves? Is that what you are asking?

ADEIMANTUS: Yes.

SOCRATES: I think we will discover what to say if we follow the same path
as before.You see, our reply will be this: it would not be at all surprising if
these people were happiest just as they are. However, in establishing our
city, we are not looking to make any one group in it outstandingly happy,
but to make the whole city so as far as possible. For we thought that we
would be most likely to ﬁnd justice in such a city, and injustice, by contrast,
in the one that is governed worst. And we thought that by observing both
cities, we would be able to decide the question we have been inquiring into
(c) for so long. At the moment, then, we take ourselves to be forming a happy
city—not separating off a few happy people and putting them in it, but
making the city as a whole happy. (We will look at the opposite city soon.)1
[1]: This discussion begins at 445c, but is interrupted and does not resume again until
Book 8.

Suppose, then, that we were painting a statue2 and someone came up to
us and started to criticize us, saying that we had not applied the most beau-
tiful colors to the most beautiful parts of the statue; because the eyes, which
are the most beautiful part, had been painted black rather than purple.We
would think it reasonable to offer the following defense: “My amazing fel-
(d) low, you must not expect us to paint the eyes so beautifully that they no
longer look like eyes at all, nor the other parts either. On the contrary, you
must look to see whether, by dealing with each part appropriately, we are
making the whole thing beautiful. Similarly, in the present case, you must
not force us to give our guardians the sort of happiness that would make
(e) them something other than guardians.You see, we know how to clothe the
farmers in purple robes, festoon them with gold jewelry, and tell them to
work the land whenever they please.We know we could have our potters
recline on couches from right to left in front of the ﬁre,3 drinking and
feasting with their wheel beside them for whenever they have a desire to
make pots. And we can make all the others happy in the same way, so that
the whole city is happy. But please do not urge us to do this. For if we are
persuaded by you, a farmer won’t be a farmer, nor a potter a potter, nor
(421a) will any of the others from which a city is constituted remain true to type.

But for most of the others, it matters less: cobblers who become inferior
and corrupt, and claim to be what they are not, do nothing terrible to the
city. But if the guardians of our laws and city are not really what they seem
to be, you may be sure that they will destroy the city utterly and, on the
other hand, that they alone have the opportunity to govern it well and
make it happy.”
Now, if we are making genuine guardians, the sort least likely to do the
(a) (b) city evil, and if our critic is making pseudo-farmers—feasters happy at
festival, so to speak, not in a city—he is not talking about a city, but about
something else. What we have to consider, then, is whether our aim in
establishing the guardians is the greatest possible happiness for them, or
whether—since our aim is to see this happiness develop for the whole
(c) city—we should compel or persuade the auxiliaries and guardians to ensure
that they, and all the others as well, are the best possible craftsmen at their
own work; and then, with the whole city developing and being governed
well, leave it to nature to provide each group with its share of happiness.

ADEIMANTUS: Yes, I think what you say is right.

SOCRATES: Well, then, will you also think me reasonable if I say some-
thing closely related?

[2]: Ancient Greek statues were painted and gilded.

[3]: At formal drinking parties (sumposia), the toastmaster (sumposiarchos) sat at the head
of the table.The others sat in order of their importance, from his right counterclock-
wise around the table to his left.

ADEIMANTUS: What exactly?

SOCRATES: Take the rest of the craftsmen again, and consider whether
(d) these things corrupt them to such an extent that they actually become bad.

ADEIMANTUS: What things?

SOCRATES: Wealth and poverty.

ADEIMANTUS: What do you mean?

SOCRATES: This: do you think that a potter who has become wealthy will
still be willing to devote himself to his craft?

ADEIMANTUS: Not at all.

SOCRATES: Won’t he become idler and more careless than he was?

ADEIMANTUS: Much more.

SOCRATES: Then won’t he become a worse potter?

ADEIMANTUS: Yes, much worse.

SOCRATES: And surely if poverty prevents him from providing himself with
tools, or any of the other things he needs for his craft, he will make poorer
(e) products himself and worse craftsmen of his sons or anyone else he teaches.

ADEIMANTUS: Of course.

SOCRATES: So poverty and wealth make the products and the practitioners
of the crafts worse.

ADEIMANTUS: Apparently.

SOCRATES: It seems, then, that we have found other things that our
guardians must prevent in every way from slipping into the city undetected.

ADEIMANTUS: What things?
(422a) SOCRATES: Wealth and poverty. For the former makes for luxury, idleness,
and revolution; and the latter for illiberality, bad work, and revolution as
well.

ADEIMANTUS: That’s right. But consider this, Socrates: how will our city
be able to ﬁght a war if it has acquired no wealth—especially if it has to
ﬁght a great and wealthy city?

SOCRATES: Obviously, it will be harder to ﬁght one such city, but easier to
(b) ﬁght two.

ADEIMANTUS: How do you mean?

SOCRATES: First of all, if our city has to ﬁght a city of the sort you men-
tion, won’t it be a case of warrior-athletes ﬁghting rich men?

ADEIMANTUS: Yes, it will.

SOCRATES: Well, then, Adeimantus, don’t you think that a single boxer
who has had the best possible training could easily ﬁght two non-boxers
who are rich and fat?

ADEIMANTUS: Maybe not at the same time.

SOCRATES: Not even if he could start to run away and then turn and hit
(c) the one who caught up with him ﬁrst, and could do this often, out in the
stiﬂing heat of the sun? Couldn’t a man like that overcome even more than
two such enemies?

ADEIMANTUS: It certainly would not be surprising if he could.

SOCRATES: Well, don’t you think that rich people have more knowledge
and experience of boxing than of how to ﬁght a war?

ADEIMANTUS: I do.

SOCRATES: In all likelihood, then, our athletes will easily be able to ﬁght
two or three times their number.

ADEIMANTUS: I will have to grant you that, since I think what you say is
right.
(d) SOCRATES: Well, then, what if they sent an envoy to another city with the
following true message: “We use no gold or silver. It is against divine law
for us to do so, but not for you. So join us in this war and you can have the
property of our enemy.” Do you think that anyone who heard this message
would choose to ﬁght hard, lean hounds, rather than to join the hounds in
ﬁghting fat and tender sheep?

ADEIMANTUS: No, I do not. But if the wealth of all other cities were
(e) amassed by a single one, don’t you think that would endanger your non-
wealthy city?

SOCRATES: You are happily innocent if you think that any city besides the
one we are constructing deserves to be called a city.

ADEIMANTUS: What should we call them, then?

SOCRATES: We will have to ﬁnd a “greater” title for the others because
each of them is a great many cities, but not a city, as they say in the game.4
They contain two, at any rate, which are at war with one another: the city
(423a) of the poor and that of the rich. And within each of these, there are a great
many more. So if you treat them as one city, you will be making a big mis-
take. But if you treat them as many and offer one the money, power, and
the very inhabitants of another, you will always ﬁnd many allies and few
[4]: The reference is obscure; it may be to a saying or proverb, or to a game like check-
ers called poleis, or cities, in which the set of pieces on each side, or perhaps any sub-
set of them, were called cities, while the individual members of the sets were called
dogs.

enemies. And as long as your own city is temperately governed in the way
we just arranged, it will be the greatest one—not in reputation; I do not
mean that; but the greatest in fact—even if it has only a thousand soldiers to
defend it. For you won’t easily ﬁnd one city so great among either Greeks
or barbarians, though you will ﬁnd many that are reputed to be many times
(b) greater. Or do you disagree?

ADEIMANTUS: No, by Zeus, I do not.

SOCRATES: This, then, would also provide our rulers with the best limit
for determining the proper size of the city, and how much land they should
mark off for a city that size, letting the rest go.

ADEIMANTUS: What limit is that?

SOCRATES: I think it is this: as long as it is willing to remain one city, it
may continue to grow, but not beyond that point.
(c) ADEIMANTUS: And it is a good one.

SOCRATES: Then we will also give our guardians this further order, that
they are to guard in every possible way against the city’s being either small in
size or great in reputation, rather than adequate in size and one in number.

ADEIMANTUS: No doubt, that will be a trivial instruction for them to follow!

SOCRATES: Here is another that is even more trivial.We mentioned it ear-
lier as well.5 We said that if an offspring of the guardians is inferior, he must
be sent off to join the other citizens, and that if the others have an excellent
(d) offspring, he must join the guardians. This was meant to make clear that
every other citizen, too, must be assigned to what naturally suits him, with
one person assigned to one job so that, practicing his own pursuit, each of
them will become not many but one, and the entire city thereby naturally
grow to be one, not many.

ADEIMANTUS: Oh, yes, that is a more minor one!

SOCRATES: Really, my good Adeimantus, the orders we are giving them
are neither as numerous nor as difﬁcult as one would think. Indeed, they
are all insigniﬁcant provided, as the saying goes, they safeguard the one
great thing—or rather not great but adequate.6
(e)
ADEIMANTUS: What’s that?

SOCRATES: Their education and upbringing. For if a good education
makes them moderate men, they will easily discover all this for them-
selves—and everything else that we are now omitting, such as the posses-
sion of women, marriages, and the procreation of children, and how all
[5]: 415a–c.

[6]: See 423c4.

(424a) these must be governed as far as possible by the old proverb that friends
share everything in common.

ADEIMANTUS: Yes, that would be best.

SOCRATES: And surely once our constitution is well started, it will, as it
were, go on growing in a circle. For good education and upbringing, if
they are kept up, produce good natures; and sound natures, which in turn
receive such an education, grow up even better than their predecessors in
every respect—but particularly with respect to their offspring, as in the case
(b) of all the other animals.

ADEIMANTUS: Yes, probably so.

SOCRATES: To put it brieﬂy, then, what the overseers of our city must
cling to, not allow to become corrupted without their noticing it, and
guard against everything, is this: there must be no innovation in musical or
physical training that goes against the established order. On the contrary,
they must guard against that as much as they can. And they should dread to
hear anyone say that “people think most of the song that ﬂoats newest from
the singer’s lips,”7 in case someone happens to suppose that the poet means

(c) not new songs, but a new way of singing, and praises that. We should not
praise such a claim, however, or take it to be what the poet meant.You see,
(a) change to a new kind of musical training is something to beware of as
wholly dangerous. For one can never change the ways of training people in
music without affecting the greatest political laws. That is what Damon
says, and I am convinced he is right.

ADEIMANTUS: You can also count me among those who are convinced.
(d) SOCRATES: It seems, then, that it is in musical training that the guardhouse
of our guardians must surely be built.

ADEIMANTUS: At any rate, this sort of lawlessness easily inserts itself unde-
tected.

SOCRATES: Yes, because it is supposed to be only part of a game that, as
such, can do no harm.

ADEIMANTUS: And it does not do any—except, of course, that when it has
established itself there, it slowly and silently ﬂows over into people’s habits
and practices. From these it travels forth with greater vigor into private
contracts, and then from private contracts it advances with the utmost inso-
(e) lence into the laws and constitution, Socrates, until in the end it overthrows
everything public and private.

SOCRATES: Well, is that so?

ADEIMANTUS: I think it is.

[7]: Odyssey 1.351–2. Our text of Homer is slightly different.

SOCRATES: Then, as we were saying at the beginning, our children must
take part in games that are more law-abiding right from the start, since, if
their games become lawless and the children follow suit, isn’t it impossible
(425a) for them to grow up into excellent and law-abiding men?

ADEIMANTUS: Of course.

SOCRATES: So whenever children play in a good way right from the start
and absorb lawfulness from musical training, there is the opposite result:
lawfulness follows them in everything and fosters their growth, correcting
anything in the city that may have been neglected before.

ADEIMANTUS: That’s true.

SOCRATES: And so such people rediscover the seemingly insigniﬁcant
conventional views their predecessors had destroyed.

ADEIMANTUS: Which sort?

SOCRATES: Those dealing with things like this: the silence appropriate for
(b) younger people in the presence of their elders; the giving up of seats for
them and standing up in their presence; the care of parents; hairstyles;
clothing; shoes; the general appearance of the body; and everything else of
that sort. Don’t you agree?

ADEIMANTUS: I do.

SOCRATES: To legislate about such things is naïve, in my view, since verbal
or written decrees will never make them come about or last.

ADEIMANTUS: How could they?

SOCRATES: At any rate, Adeimantus, it looks as though the start of some-
(c) one’s education determines what follows. Or doesn’t like always encourage
like?

ADEIMANTUS: It does.

SOCRATES: And the ﬁnal outcome of education, I imagine we would say,
is a single, complete, and fresh product that is either good or the opposite.

ADEIMANTUS: Of course.

SOCRATES: That is why I, for my part, would not try to legislate about
such things.

ADEIMANTUS: And with good reason.

SOCRATES: Then, by the gods, what about all that marketplace business,
the contracts people make with one another in the marketplace, for exam-
(d) ple, and contracts with handicraftsmen, and slanders, injuries, indictments,
establishing juries, paying or collecting whatever dues are necessary in mar-
ketplace and harbors, and, in a word, the entire regulation of marketplace,
city, harbor, or what have you—dare we legislate about any of these?

ADEIMANTUS: No, it would not be appropriate to dictate to men who are
ﬁne and good. For they will easily ﬁnd out for themselves whatever needs
(e) to be legislated about such things.

SOCRATES: Yes, my friend, provided that a god grants that the laws we
have already described are preserved intact.

ADEIMANTUS: If not, they will spend their lives continually enacting and
amending such laws in the hope of ﬁnding what is best.

SOCRATES: You mean they will live like those sick people who, because
they are intemperate, are not willing to abandon their bad way of life.

ADEIMANTUS: That’s right.
(426a) SOCRATES: Such people really do lead a charming life! Their medical
treatment achieves nothing, except to make their illnesses worse and more
complex, and they are always hoping that someone will recommend some
new drug that will make them healthy.

ADEIMANTUS: Yes, that’s exactly what happens to invalids of this sort.

SOCRATES: And isn’t it another charming feature of theirs that they think
their worst enemy of all is the one who tells them the truth—that until
they give up drunkenness, overeating, sexual indulgence, and idleness, then
(b) no drug, cautery, or surgery, no charms, amulets, or anything else of that
sort will do them any good?

ADEIMANTUS: It is not charming at all. Being harsh to someone who tells
the truth is not charming.

SOCRATES: You do not approve of such men, apparently.

ADEIMANTUS: No, by Zeus, I do not.

SOCRATES: Then nor will you approve of an entire city that behaves in the
way we were just describing. Or don’t you think that such invalids behave
in the very same way as cities where the following occurs? Because they are
badly governed politically, the citizens are warned not to change the city’s
(c) whole political system, and the one who does is threatened with the death
penalty. But the one who serves these cities most pleasantly, while they
remain politically governed in that way; who indulges them, ﬂatters them,
anticipates their wishes, and is clever at fulﬁlling them; isn’t he, on that
account, honored by them as a good man who is wise in the most impor-
tant matters?

ADEIMANTUS: Yes, I think their behavior is the same and I do not approve
of it at all.

SOCRATES: What about those who are willing and eager to provide treat-
(d) ment for such cities? Don’t you approve of their courage and also their
lighthearted irresponsibility?

ADEIMANTUS: I do indeed—except for those who are actually deluded
and suppose themselves to be true men of politics because they are praised
by the masses.

SOCRATES: What do you mean? Have you no sympathy for these men? Or
do you think it is possible for a man who does not know how to measure
anything not to believe that he is four cubits tall8 when many others, who
(e) are similarly ignorant, tell him that he is?

ADEIMANTUS: No, I do not think that.

SOCRATES: Then do not be too hard on them.You see, such people are
surely the most charming of all.They pass and amend the sorts of laws we
(a) have just been describing, and are always expecting that they will ﬁnd
way to put a stop to cheating on contracts, and the other evildoings I
(a) mentioned just now, not realizing that they are really just cutting off
Hydra’s head.9
(427a) ADEIMANTUS: Yet that is all they are really doing.

SOCRATES: I would have thought, then, that a true lawgiver should not
bother with laws or constitutions of this kind, whether in a politically badly
governed or in a politically well-governed city—in the one because it is
useless and accomplishes nothing; in the other because some of them are
discoverable by anyone, while the others follow automatically from the
practices already described.
(b) ADEIMANTUS: What remains for us to legislate, then?

SOCRATES: For us, nothing; but for the Delphic Apollo, there remain the
greatest, ﬁnest, and ﬁrst of legislations.

ADEIMANTUS: What are they about?

SOCRATES: The establishing of temples and sacriﬁces, and other forms of
service to gods, daimons, and heroes; the burial of the dead, and the ser-
vices that ensure the favor of those who have gone to the other world. For
we, of course, have no knowledge of these things and so, when we are
founding a city, we won’t take anyone else’s advice, if we have any sense, or
(c) employ any interpreter except our ancestral one. And in fact, this god—as
he delivers his interpretations from his seat at the navel of the earth10—is
the ancestral guide on these matters for the whole human race.

ADEIMANTUS: Well put.That is what we must do.

[8]: Roughly seven feet.A cubit is between seventeen and twenty-two inches long.

[9]: The Hydra was a mythical monster.When one of its heads was cut off, two or three
new heads grew in its place. Heracles (or Hercules) had to slay the Hydra as one of
his labors.

[10]: The oracle of Apollo at Delphi was traditionally consulted by all Greeks on reli-
gious and other such matters.A stone there marked the supposed center of the earth.

SOCRATES: So then, son of Ariston, your city would now seem to be
(d) founded. As the next step, look inside it, having got hold of an adequate
light somewhere. Look yourself and invite your brother and Polemarchus
and the rest of us to help you, to see where justice and injustice might be in
it, how they differ from one another, and which of the two must be pos-
sessed by the person who is going to be happy, whether that fact is hidden
from all gods and humans or not.

> *And Glaucon said:*
That’s nonsense! You promised you would look for them yourself, because
(e) you said it was impious for you not to defend justice in every way you
could.11
SOCRATES: You are right to remind me, and I must do what I promised.

But you will have to help.

GLAUCON: We will.

SOCRATES: I expect, then, to ﬁnd justice in the following way. I think our
city, if indeed it has been correctly founded, is completely good.

GLAUCON: Yes, it must be.

SOCRATES: Clearly, then, it is wise, courageous, temperate, and just.

GLAUCON: Clearly.

SOCRATES: Then if we ﬁnd any of these in it, what remains will be what
we have not found?
(428a) GLAUCON: Of course.

SOCRATES: Therefore, as in the case of any other four things, if we were
looking for one of them in something and recognized it ﬁrst, that would be
enough to satisfy us. But if we recognized the other three ﬁrst, that itself
would enable us to recognize what we were looking for, since clearly it
could not be anything other than the one that remains.

GLAUCON: That’s right.

SOCRATES: So, since there also happen to be four things we are interested
in, mustn’t we look for them in the same way?

GLAUCON: Clearly.

SOCRATES: Now, the ﬁrst thing I think I can see clearly in the city is wis-
(b) dom. And there seems to be something odd about it.

GLAUCON: What?
[11]: 368b7–c3.

SOCRATES: I think that the city we described is really wise. And that is
because it is prudent,12 isn’t it?

GLAUCON: Yes.

SOCRATES: And surely it is clear that this very thing, prudence, is some
sort of knowledge. I mean, it certainly is not through ignorance that people
do the prudent thing, but through knowledge.

GLAUCON: Clearly.

SOCRATES: But there are, of course, many multifarious sorts of knowledge
in the city.

GLAUCON: Certainly.

SOCRATES: So, is it because of the knowledge possessed by the carpenters
that the city deserves to be described as wise and prudent?
(c) GLAUCON: Not at all. It is called skilled in carpentry because of that.

SOCRATES: So a city shouldn’t be called wise because it has the knowledge
that deliberates about how wooden things can be best.

GLAUCON: Certainly not.

SOCRATES: What about this, then? What about the knowledge of things
made of bronze, or anything else of that sort?

GLAUCON: Not anything of that sort either.

SOCRATES: And not the knowledge of how to produce crops from the
soil. On the contrary, it is skilled in farming because of that.

GLAUCON: That’s my view.

SOCRATES: Then is there some knowledge in the city we have just
founded, which some of its citizens have, that does not deliberate about
(d) some particular thing in the city, but about the city as a whole, and about
how its internal relations and its relations with other cities will be the best
possible.

GLAUCON: There is indeed.

SOCRATES: What is it and who has it?

GLAUCON: It is the craft of guardianship. And the ones who possess it are
those rulers we just now called complete guardians.13
SOCRATES: Because it has this knowledge, then, how do you describe the
city?

[12]: Euboulos: In Greek cities, the boulê was the council that had day-to-day responsi-
bility for public affairs. In kingships it served as an advisory body to the kings; in
democratic Athens it served as an advisory body and steering committee for the
assembly of all the adult male citizens.
[13]: 414b1–6.

GLAUCON: As prudent and really wise.

SOCRATES: Now, do you think that there will be more metalworkers in
(e) the city, or more of these true guardians?

GLAUCON: There will be far more metalworkers.

SOCRATES: Of all those who are called by a certain name because they
have some sort of knowledge, wouldn’t the true guardians be the fewest in
number?

GLAUCON: By far.

SOCRATES: So, it is because of the smallest group or part of itself, and the
knowledge that is in it—the part that governs and rules—that a city
founded according to nature would be wise as a whole. And this class—
which seems to be, by nature, the smallest—is the one that inherently pos-
(429a) sesses a share of the knowledge that alone among all the other sorts of
knowledge should be called wisdom.

GLAUCON: That’s absolutely true.

SOCRATES: So we have found—though I do not know how—this one of
the four and its place in the city, too.

GLAUCON: It seems to me, at least, that it has been well and truly found.

SOCRATES: But surely courage and the part of the city it is in, and because
of which the city is described as courageous, is not very difﬁcult to spot.

GLAUCON: How so?
(b) SOCRATES: Who would describe a city as cowardly or courageous by
looking at anything other than that part which defends it and wages war on
its behalf?

GLAUCON: No one would look at anything else.

SOCRATES: Because, I take it, whether the others are courageous or cow-
ardly doesn’t make it one or the other.

GLAUCON: No, it doesn’t.

SOCRATES: So courage, too, belongs to a city because of a part of itself—
because it has in that part the power to preserve through everything its
belief that the things, and the sorts of things, that should inspire terror are
(c) the very things, and sorts of things, that the lawgiver declared to be such in
the course of educating it. Or don’t you call that courage?

GLAUCON: I do not completely understand what you said. Would you
mind repeating it?

SOCRATES: I mean that courage is a sort of preservation.

GLAUCON: What sort of preservation?

SOCRATES: The preservation of the belief, inculcated by the law through
education, about what things, and what sorts of things, inspire terror. And
by its preservation “through everything,” I mean preserving it though pains,
(d) pleasures, appetites, and fears and not abandoning it. I will compare it to
something I think it resembles, if you like.

GLAUCON: I would like that.

SOCRATES: You know, then, that when dyers want to dye wool purple,
they ﬁrst select from wools of many different colors the ones that are natu-
rally white.Then they give them an elaborate preparatory treatment, so that
they will accept the color as well as possible. And only at that point do they
dip them in the purple dye. When something is dyed in this way, it holds
(e) the dye fast, and no amount of washing, whether with or without deter-
gent, can remove the color. But you also know what happens when things
are not dyed in this way, when one dyes wools of other colors, or even
these white ones, without preparatory treatment.

GLAUCON: I know they look washed out and ridiculous.

SOCRATES: You should take it, then, that we too were trying as hard as we
could to do something similar when we selected our soldiers and educated
them in musical and physical training. It was contrived, you should sup-
(430a) pose, for no purpose other than to ensure that—persuaded by us—they
would absorb the laws in the best possible way, just like wool does a dye;
that as a result, their beliefs about what things should inspire terror, and
about everything else, would hold fast because they had the proper nature
and rearing; so fast that the dye could not be washed out even by those
detergents that are so terribly effective at scouring—pleasure, which is
much more terribly effective at this than any chalestrian14 or alkali, and
(b) pain and fear and appetite, which are worse than any detergent.This power,
then, to preserve through everything the correct and law-inculcated belief
about what should inspire terror and what should not is what I, at any rate,
call courage. And I will assume it is this, unless you object.

GLAUCON: No, I have no objection. For I presume that the sort of correct
belief about these same matters that you ﬁnd in animals and slaves, which is
not the result of education and has nothing at all to do with law, is called
something other than courage.
(c) SOCRATES: You are absolutely right.

GLAUCON: Well, then, I accept your account of courage.

SOCRATES: Yes, do accept it, at any rate, as my account of political courage,
and you will be right to accept it. If you like, we will discuss that more fully
some other time.You see, at the moment, our inquiry is not about courage
[14]: Carbonate of soda from Chalestra, a town and lake in Macedonia.

but about justice. And for the purpose of that inquiry, I think that what we
have said is sufﬁcient.

GLAUCON: You are right.

SOCRATES: Two things, then, remain for us to ﬁnd in the city: temper-
ance15 and—the goal of our entire inquiry—justice.
(d)
GLAUCON: Yes, indeed.

SOCRATES: How could we ﬁnd justice, then, so we won’t have to bother
with temperance any further?

GLAUCON: Well I, for my part, do not know of any, nor would I want jus-
tice to appear ﬁrst if that means that we are not going to investigate tem-
perance any further. So if you want to please me, look for it before the
other.

SOCRATES: Of course I want to. It would be wrong not to.16
(e)
GLAUCON: Go ahead and look, then.

SOCRATES: I will.And seen from here, it is more like a sort of concord and
harmony than the previous ones.

GLAUCON: How so?

SOCRATES: Temperance is surely a sort of order, the mastery of certain
sorts of pleasures and appetites. People indicate as much when they use the
term “self-mastery”—though I do not know in what way. This and other
similar things are like tracks that temperance has left. Isn’t that so?

GLAUCON: Absolutely.

SOCRATES: Isn’t the term “self-mastery” ridiculous, though? For, of
course, the one who is master of himself is also the one who is weaker, and
the one who is weaker is also the one who masters. After all, the same per-
(431a) son is referred to in all these descriptions.

GLAUCON: Of course.

SOCRATES: It seems to me, however, that what this term is trying to indi-
cate is that within the same person’s soul, there is a better thing and a worse
one. Whenever the naturally better one masters the worse, this is called
being master of oneself. At any rate, it is praised. But whenever, as a result
of bad upbringing or associating with bad people, the smaller and better
one is mastered by the inferior majority, this is blamed as a disgraceful thing
(b) and is called being weaker than oneself, or being intemperate.

GLAUCON: Yes, that seems plausible.

[15]: See Glossary of Terms s.v. temperance.

[16]: See 427d8–e4.

SOCRATES: Now, then, take a look at our new city and you will ﬁnd one
of these conditions present in it. For you will say that it is rightly described
as master of itself, if indeed anything in which the better rules the worse is
to be described as temperate and master of itself.

GLAUCON: I am looking, and what you say is true.

SOCRATES: Furthermore, pleasures, pains, and appetites that are numerous
(c) and multifarious are things one would especially ﬁnd in children, women,
household slaves, and in the so-called free members of the masses—that is,
the inferior people.

GLAUCON: Yes.

SOCRATES: But the pleasures, pains, and appetites that are simple and
moderate, the ones that are led by rational calculation with the aid of
understanding and correct belief, you would ﬁnd in those few people who
are born with the best natures and receive the best education.

GLAUCON: That’s true.

SOCRATES: Don’t you see, then, that this too is present in your city, and
that the appetites of the masses—the inferior people—are mastered there by
(d) the wisdom and appetites of the few—the best people?

GLAUCON: I do.

SOCRATES: So, if any city is said to be master of its pleasures and appetites
and of itself, it is this one.

GLAUCON: Absolutely.

SOCRATES: So isn’t it also temperate because of all this?

GLAUCON: Yes, indeed.

SOCRATES: And moreover, if there is any city in which rulers and subjects
(e) share the same belief about who should rule, it is this one. Or don’t you
agree?

GLAUCON: Yes, I certainly do.

SOCRATES: And in which of them do you say temperance is located when
they are in this condition? In the rulers or the subjects?

GLAUCON: In both, I suppose.

SOCRATES: Do you see, then, that the hunch we had just now—that tem-
perance is like a sort of harmony—was quite plausible?

GLAUCON: Why is that?

SOCRATES: Because its operation is unlike that of courage and wisdom,
each of which resides in one part and makes the city either courageous or
(432a) wise. Temperance does not work like that, but has literally been stretched

throughout the whole, making the weakest, the strongest, and those in
between all sing the same song in unison—whether in wisdom, if you like,
or in physical strength, if you prefer; or, for that matter, in numbers,
wealth, or anything else. Hence we would be absolutely right to say that
this unanimity is temperance—this concord between the naturally worse
and the naturally better, about which of the two should rule both in the
city and in each individual.
(b) GLAUCON: I agree completely.

SOCRATES: All right. We have now spotted three kinds of virtue in our
city.What kind remains, then, that would give the city yet another share of
virtue? For it is clear that what remains is justice.

GLAUCON: It is clear.

SOCRATES: So then, Glaucon, we must now station ourselves like hunters
surrounding a wood and concentrate our minds, so that justice does not
escape us and vanish into obscurity. For it is clear that it is around here
(c) somewhere. Keep your eyes peeled and do your best to catch sight of it,
and if you happen to see it before I do, show it to me.

GLAUCON: I wish I could help. But it is rather the case that if you use me
as a follower who can see only what you point out to him, you will be
using me in a more reasonable way.

SOCRATES: Pray for success, then, and follow me.

GLAUCON: I will.You have only to lead.

SOCRATES: And it truly seems to be an impenetrable place and full of
shadows. It is dark, at any rate, and difﬁcult to search through. But all the
same, we must go on.
(d) GLAUCON: Yes, we must.

> *And then I caught sight of something and shouted:*
SOCRATES: Ah ha!17 Glaucon, it looks as though there is a track here, and
I do not think our quarry will altogether escape us.

GLAUCON: That’s good news.

SOCRATES: Oh dear, what a stupid condition in which to ﬁnd ourselves!

GLAUCON: How so?

SOCRATES: It seems, blessed though you are, that the thing has been roll-
ing around at our feet from the very beginning, and yet, like ridiculous
fools, we could not see it. For just as people who are holding something in
their hands sometimes search for the very thing they are holding, we did
[17]: Iou iou: usually a cry of woe in tragedy, not (like iô iô) a cry of joy.

(e) not look in the right direction but gazed off into the distance, and perhaps
that is the very reason we did not notice it.

GLAUCON: What do you mean?

SOCRATES: This: I think we have been talking and hearing about it all this
time without understanding ourselves, or realizing that we were, in a way,
talking about it.

GLAUCON: That was a long prelude! Now I want to hear what you mean!

SOCRATES: Listen, then, and see whether there is anything in what I say.
(433a) You see, what we laid down at the beginning when we were founding our
city, about what should be done throughout it—that, I think, or some form
of that, is justice. And surely what we laid down and often repeated, if you
remember, is that each person must practice one of the pursuits in the city,
the one for which he is naturally best suited.

GLAUCON: Yes, we did say that.

SOCRATES: Moreover, we have heard many people say, and have often said
ourselves, that justice is doing one’s own work and not meddling with what
(b) is not one’s own.

GLAUCON: Yes, we have.

SOCRATES: This, then, my friend, provided it is taken in a certain way,
would seem to be justice—this doing one’s own work. And do you know
what I take as evidence of that?

GLAUCON: No, tell me.

SOCRATES: After our consideration of temperance, courage, and wisdom,
I think that what remains in the city is the power that makes it possible for
all of these to arise in it, and that preserves them when they have arisen for
(c) as long as it remains there itself. And we did say that justice would be what
remained when we had found the other three.18
GLAUCON: Yes, that must be so.

SOCRATES: Yet, surely, if we had to decide which of these will most con-
tribute to making our city good by being present in it, it would be difﬁcult
to decide. Is it the agreement in belief between the rulers and the subjects?

The preservation among the soldiers of the law-inculcated belief about
what should inspire terror and what should not? The wisdom and guardian-
(d) ship of the rulers? Or is what most contributes to making it good the fact
that every child, woman, slave, free person, craftsman, ruler, and subject
each does his own work and does not meddle with what is not?

GLAUCON: Of course it’s a difﬁcult decision.
[18]: 428a2–9.

SOCRATES: It seems, then, that this power—which consists in everyone’s
doing his own work—rivals wisdom, temperance, and courage in its con-
tribution to the city’s virtue.

GLAUCON: It certainly does.

SOCRATES: And wouldn’t you say that justice is certainly what rivals them
(e) in contributing to the city’s virtue?

GLAUCON: Absolutely.

SOCRATES: Look at it this way, too, if you want to be convinced. Won’t
you assign to the rulers the job of judging lawsuits in the city?

GLAUCON: Of course.

SOCRATES: And will they have any aim in judging other than this: that no
citizen should have what is another’s or be deprived of what is his own?

GLAUCON: No, they will have none but that.

SOCRATES: Because that is just?

GLAUCON: Yes.

SOCRATES: So from that point of view, too, having and doing of one’s
(434a) own, of what belongs to one, would be agreed to be justice.

GLAUCON: That’s right.

SOCRATES: Now, see whether you agree with me about this: if a carpenter
attempts to do the work of a shoemaker, or a shoemaker that of a carpenter,
or they exchange their tools or honors with one another, or if the same
person tries to do both jobs, and all other such exchanges are made, do you
think that does any great harm to the city?

GLAUCON: Not really.

SOCRATES: But I imagine that when someone who is, by nature, a crafts-
man or some other sort of moneymaker is puffed up by wealth, or by hav-
(b) ing a majority of votes, or by his own strength, or by some other such
thing, and attempts to enter the class of soldiers; or when one of the sol-
diers who is unworthy to do so tries to enter that of judge and guardian,
and these exchange their tools and honors; or when the same person tries
to do all these things at once, then I imagine you will agree that these
exchanges and this meddling destroy the city.

GLAUCON: Absolutely.

SOCRATES: So, meddling and exchange among these three classes is the
(c) greatest harm that can happen to the city and would rightly be called the
worst evil one could do to it.

GLAUCON: Exactly.

SOCRATES: And wouldn’t you say that the worst evil one could do to one’s
own city is injustice?

GLAUCON: Of course.

SOCRATES: That, then, is what injustice is. But let’s put it in reverse: the
opposite of this—when the moneymaking, auxiliary, and guardian class
each do their own work in the city—is justice, isn’t it, and makes the city
just?
(d) GLAUCON: That’s exactly what I think too.

SOCRATES: Let’s not state it as ﬁxedly established just yet. But if this kind
of thing is agreed by us to be justice in the case of individual human beings
as well, then we can assent to it. For what else will there be for us to say?

But if it is not, we will have to look for something else. For the moment,
however, let’s complete the inquiry in which we supposed that if we ﬁrst
tried to observe justice in some larger thing that possessed it, that would
make it easier to see what it is like in an individual human being.19 We
(e) agreed that this larger thing is a city, and so we founded the best city we
could, knowing well that justice would of course be present in one that was
good. So, let’s apply what has come to light for us there to an individual,
and if it is conﬁrmed, all will be well. But if something different is found in
the case of the individual, we will go back to the city and test it there. And
perhaps by examining them side by side and rubbing them together like
(435a) ﬁre-sticks, we can make justice blaze forth and, once it has come to light,
conﬁrm it in our own case.

GLAUCON: Well, the road you describe is the right one, and we should
follow it.

SOCRATES: Well, then, if you call a bigger thing and a smaller thing by the
same name, are they unalike in the respect in which they are called the
same, or alike?

GLAUCON: Alike.

SOCRATES: So a just man won’t differ at all from a just city with respect to
(b) the form of justice but will be like it.

GLAUCON: Yes, he will be like it.

SOCRATES: But now, the city, at any rate, was thought to be just because
each of the three natural classes within it did its own job; and to be temper-
ate, courageous, and wise, in addition, because of certain other conditions
or states of these same classes.

GLAUCON: That’s true.
[19]: 368c7–369a3.

SOCRATES: Then, my friend, we would expect an individual to have these
same kinds of things in his soul, and to be correctly called by the same
(c) names as the city because the same conditions are present in them both.

GLAUCON: Inevitably.

SOCRATES: Well, you amazing fellow, here is another trivial investigation20
we have stumbled into: does the soul have these three kinds of things in it
or not?

GLAUCON: It does not look at all trivial to me. Perhaps, Socrates, there is
some truth in the old saying that everything beautiful is difﬁcult.

SOCRATES: Apparently so. In fact, you should be well aware, Glaucon,
that it is my belief we will never ever grasp this matter precisely by methods
(d) of the sort we are now using in our discussions. However, there is in fact
another longer and more time-consuming road that does lead there.21 But
perhaps we can manage to come up to the standard of our previous state-
ments and inquiries.

GLAUCON: Shouldn’t we be content with that? It would be enough for
me, at least for now.

SOCRATES: Well, then, it will be quite satisfactory for me, too.

GLAUCON: Then do not weary, but go on with the inquiry.
(e) SOCRATES: Well, isn’t it absolutely necessary for us to agree to this much:
that the very same kinds of things and conditions exist in each one of us as
exist in the city? After all, where else would they come from? You see, it
would be ridiculous for anyone to think that spiritedness did not come to
be in cities from the private individuals who are reputed to have this qual-
ity, such as the Thracians, Scythians, and others who live to the north of us;
or that the same is not true of the love of learning, which is mostly associ-
(436a) ated with our part of the world; or of the love of money, which is said to be
found not least among the Phoenicians and Egyptians.

GLAUCON: It certainly would.

SOCRATES: We may take that as being so, then, and it was not at all difﬁ-
cult to discover.

GLAUCON: No, it certainly was not.

SOCRATES: But this, now, is difﬁcult. Do we do each of them with the
same thing or, since there are three, do we do one with one and another
with another: that is to say, do we learn with one, feel anger with another,
and with yet a third have an appetite for the pleasures of food, sex, and
[20]: See 423c5–e2.

[21]: See 504b1–c4 for an explanation.

those closely akin to them? Or do we do each of them with the whole of
(b) our soul, once we feel the impulse? That is what is difﬁcult to determine in
(a) way that is up to the standards of our argument.

GLAUCON: I think so, too.

SOCRATES: Well, then, let’s try in this way to determine whether they are
the same as one another or different.

GLAUCON: What way?

SOCRATES: It is clear that the same thing cannot do or undergo opposite
things; not, at any rate, in the same respect, in relation to the same thing, at
the same time. So, if we ever ﬁnd that happening here, we will know that
(c) we are not dealing with one and the same thing, but with many.

GLAUCON: All right.

SOCRATES: Consider, then, what I am about to say.

GLAUCON: Say it.

SOCRATES: Is it possible for the same thing, at the same time, and in the
same respect, to be standing still and moving?

GLAUCON: Not at all.

SOCRATES: Let’s come to a more precise agreement, in order to avoid dis-
putes later on.You see, if anyone said of a person who is standing still but
moving his hands and head, that the same thing is moving and standing still
at the same time, we would not consider, I imagine, that he should say that;
but rather that in one respect the person is standing still, while in another
(d) he is moving. Isn’t that so?

GLAUCON: It is.

SOCRATES: Then, if the one who said this became still more charming and
(a) made the sophisticated point that spinning tops, at any rate, stand still as
whole at the same time as they are also in motion, when, with the peg
ﬁxed in the same place, they revolve, or that the same holds of anything else
that moves in a circle on the same spot—we would not agree, on the
grounds that in such situations it is not in the same respects that these
objects are both moving and standing still. On the contrary, we would say
(e) that these objects have both a straight axis and a circumference in them, and
that with respect to the straight axis they stand still—since they do not
wobble to either side—whereas with respect to the circumference they
move in a circle. But if their straight axis wobbles to the left or right or
front or back at the same time as they are spinning, we will say that they are
not standing still in any way.

GLAUCON: And we would be right.

SOCRATES: No such objection will disturb us, then, or make us any more
likely to believe that the same thing can—at the same time, in the same
respect, and in relation to the same thing—undergo, be, or do opposite
(437a) things.

GLAUCON: They won’t have that effect on me at least.

SOCRATES: All the same, in order to avoid going through all these objec-
tions one by one and taking a long time to prove them all untrue, let’s
hypothesize that what we have said is correct and carry on—with the
understanding that if it should ever be shown to be incorrect, all the conse-
quences we have drawn from it will be invalidated.

GLAUCON: Yes, that’s what we should do.
(b) SOCRATES: Now, wouldn’t you consider assent and dissent, wanting to
have something and rejecting it, taking something and pushing it way, as all
being pairs of mutual opposites—whether of opposite doings or of opposite
undergoings does not matter?

GLAUCON: Yes, they are pairs of opposites.

SOCRATES: What about thirst, hunger, and the appetites as a whole, and
also wishing and willing? Would you include all of them somewhere among
(c) the kinds of things we just mentioned? For example, wouldn’t you say that
the soul of someone who has an appetite wants the thing for which it has
an appetite, and draws toward itself what it wishes to have; and, in addition,
that insofar as his soul wishes something to be given to it, it nods assent to
itself as if in answer to a question, and strives toward its attainment?

GLAUCON: I would.

SOCRATES: What about not-willing, not-wishing, and not-having an
appetite? Wouldn’t we include them among the very opposites, cases in
which the soul pushes and drives things away from itself?
(d) GLAUCON: Of course.

SOCRATES: Since that is so, won’t we say that there is a kind consisting of
appetites, and that the most conspicuous examples of them are what we call
hunger and thirst?

GLAUCON: We will.

SOCRATES: Isn’t the one for food, the other for drink?

GLAUCON: Yes.

SOCRATES: Now, insofar as it is thirst, is it an appetite in the soul for more
than what we say it is for? I mean, is thirst a thirst for hot drink or cold, or
much drink or little, or—in a word—for drink of a certain sort? Or isn’t it
rather that if heat is present in addition to thirst, it causes the appetite to be
(e) for something cold as well, whereas the addition of cold makes it an appetite

for something hot? And if there is much thirst, because of the presence of
muchness, won’t it cause the desire to be for much drink, and where little
for little? But thirst itself will never be for anything other than the very
thing that it is in its nature to be an appetite for: namely, drink itself; and,
similarly, hunger is for food.

GLAUCON: That’s the way it is. By itself, at any rate, each appetite is for its
natural object only, while an appetite for an object of this or that sort
depends on additions.

SOCRATES: No one should catch us unprepared, then, or disturb us by
(438a) claiming that no one has an appetite for drink but rather for good drink,
nor for food but rather for good food, since everyone’s appetite is for good
things. And so, if thirst is an appetite, it will be an appetite for good drink
or good whatever, and similarly for the other appetites.

GLAUCON: Yes, there might seem to be something in that objection.

SOCRATES: But surely, whenever things are related to something, those
that are of a particular sort are related to a particular sort of thing, as it
(b) seems to me, whereas those that are just themselves are related only to a
thing that is just itself.

GLAUCON: I do not understand.

SOCRATES: Don’t you understand that the greater is such as to be greater
than something?

GLAUCON: Of course.

SOCRATES: Than the less?

GLAUCON: Yes.

SOCRATES: And the much greater than the much less. Isn’t that so?

GLAUCON: Yes.

SOCRATES: And the once greater than the once less? And the going-to-be
greater than the going-to-be less?

GLAUCON: Certainly.

SOCRATES: And doesn’t the same hold of the more in relation to the
(c) fewer, the double to the half, and everything of that sort; and also of
heavier to lighter and faster to slower; and, in addition, of hot to cold, and
all other similar things?

GLAUCON: Yes, indeed.

SOCRATES: What about the various kinds of knowledge? Aren’t they the
same way? Knowledge itself is of what can be learned itself (or of whatever
we should take the object of knowledge to be), whereas a particular knowl-
edge of a particular sort is of a particular thing of a particular sort. I mean

something like this: when knowledge of building houses was developed, it
(d) differed from the other kinds of knowledge, and so was called knowledge of
building. Isn’t that so?

GLAUCON: Of course.

SOCRATES: And wasn’t that because it was a different sort of knowledge
from all the others?

GLAUCON: Yes.

SOCRATES: And wasn’t it because it was of a particular sort of thing that it
itself became a particular sort of knowledge? And isn’t this true of all the
crafts and sciences?

GLAUCON: It is.

SOCRATES: Well, then, you should think of that as what I wanted to get
across before—if you understand it now—when I said that whenever things
are related to something, those that are just themselves are related to things
that are just themselves, whereas those of a particular sort are related to
things of a particular sort.And I do not at all mean that the sorts in question
(e) have to be the same for them both—that the knowledge of health and dis-
ease is healthy and diseased, or that that of good and bad things is good and
bad. On the contrary, I mean that when knowledge occurred that was not
just knowledge of the thing itself that knowledge is of, but of something of
(a) particular sort, which in this case was health and disease, the result was
that it itself became a particular sort of knowledge; and this caused it to be
no longer called simply knowledge but, with the addition of the particular
sort, medical knowledge.

GLAUCON: I understand and I think you are right.

SOCRATES: Returning to thirst, then, wouldn’t you include it among the
(439a) things that are related to something just by being what they are? Surely
thirst is related to. . . .

GLAUCON: I would. It is related to drink.

SOCRATES: So a particular sort of thirst is for a particular sort of drink.

Thirst itself, however, is not for much or little, good or bad, or, in a word,
for drink of a particular sort; rather, thirst itself is, by nature, just for drink
itself. Right?

GLAUCON: Absolutely.

SOCRATES: Hence the soul of the thirsty person, insofar as it is simply
thirsty, does not want anything else except to drink, and this is what it
(b) longs for and is impelled to do.

GLAUCON: Clearly.

SOCRATES: Then if anything in it draws it back when it is thirsty,
wouldn’t it be something different from what thirsts and, like a beast,
drives it to drink? For surely, we say, the same thing, in the same respect of
itself, in relation to the same thing, and at the same time, cannot do oppo-
site things.

GLAUCON: No, it cannot.

SOCRATES: In the same way, I imagine, it is not right to say of the archer
that his hands at the same time push the bow away and draw it toward him.

On the contrary, we should say that one hand pushes it away, while the
other draws it toward him.
(c) GLAUCON: Absolutely.

SOCRATES: Now, we would say, wouldn’t we, that some people are thirsty
sometimes, yet unwilling to drink?

GLAUCON: Many people often are.

SOCRATES: What, then, should one say about them? Isn’t it that there is an
element in their soul urging them to drink, and also one stopping them—
something different that masters the one doing the urging?

GLAUCON: I certainly think so.

SOCRATES: Doesn’t the element doing the stopping in such cases arise—
when it does arise—from rational calculation, while the things that drive
(d) and drag are present because of feelings and diseases?

GLAUCON: Apparently so.

SOCRATES: It would not be unreasonable for us to claim, then, that there
are two elements, different from one another; and to call the element in the
soul with which it calculates, the rationally calculating element; and the
one with which it feels passion, hungers, thirsts, and is stirred by other
appetites, the irrational and appetitive element, friend to certain ways of
being ﬁlled and certain pleasures.

GLAUCON: No, it would not. Indeed, it would be a very natural thing for
(e) us to do.

SOCRATES: Let’s assume, then, that we have distinguished these two kinds
of elements in the soul. Now, is the spirited element—the one with which
we feel anger—a third kind of thing, or is it the same in nature as one of
these others?

GLAUCON: As the appetitive element, perhaps.

SOCRATES: But I once heard a story and I believe it. Leontius, the son of
Aglaeon, was going up from the Piraeus along the outside of the North Wall
when he saw some corpses with the public executioner nearby. He had an
appetitive desire to look at them, but at the same time he was disgusted and
turned himself away. For a while he struggled and put his hand over his eyes,
(440a) but ﬁnally, mastered by his appetite, he opened his eyes wide and rushed
toward the corpses, saying: “Look for yourselves, you evil wretches; take
your ﬁll of the beautiful sight.”22
GLAUCON: I have also heard that story myself.

SOCRATES: Yet, surely, the story suggests that anger sometimes makes war
against the appetites as one thing against another.

GLAUCON: Yes, it does suggest that.

SOCRATES: And don’t we often notice on other occasions that when
(b) appetite forces someone contrary to his rational calculation, he reproaches
himself and feels anger at the thing in him that is doing the forcing; and just
as if there were two warring factions, such a person’s spirit becomes the ally
of his reason? But spirit partnering the appetites to do what reason has
decided should not be done—I do not imagine you would say that you had
ever seen that, either in yourself or in anyone else.

GLAUCON: No, by Zeus, I would not.

SOCRATES: And what about when a person thinks he is doing some injus-
(c) tice? Isn’t it true that the nobler he is, the less capable he is of feeling angry
if he suffers hunger, cold, or the like at the hands of someone whom he
believes to be inﬂicting this on him justly; and won’t his spirit, as I say,
refuse to be aroused?

GLAUCON: It is true.

SOCRATES: But what about when a person believes he is being unjustly
treated? Doesn’t his spirit boil then, and grow harsh and ﬁght as an ally of
what he holds to be just? And even if it suffers hunger, cold, and every
imposition of that sort, doesn’t it stand ﬁrm and win out over them, not
(d) ceasing its noble efforts until it achieves its purpose, or dies, or, like a dog
being called to heel by a shepherd, is called back by the reason alongside it
and becomes gentle?

GLAUCON: Your simile is perfect. And, in fact, we did put the auxiliaries
in our city to be like obedient sheepdogs for the city’s shepherdlike rulers.

SOCRATES: You have understood what I was trying to say very well. But
have you also noticed something else about it?
(e) GLAUCON: What?

[22]: A fragment of the comedy Kapêlides by Theopompus (410–370 BCE) tells us that
(a) certain Leontinus (emended to Leontius because of Plato’s reference here) was
known for his love of boys as pale as corpses. So his desire is probably sexual in ori-
gin, and for that reason appetitive.The North and South Walls enclosed an area con-
necting Athens to Piraeus.

SOCRATES: That it is the opposite of what we recently thought about the
kind of thing spirit is.You see, then we thought of it as something appeti-
tive.23 But now, far from saying that, we say that in the faction that takes
place in the soul, it is far more likely to take arms on the side of the ratio-
nally calculating element.

GLAUCON: Absolutely.

SOCRATES: Is it also different from this, then, or is it some kind of ratio-
nally calculating element, so that there are not three kinds of things in the
soul, but two—the rationally calculating element and the appetitive one?

Or rather, just as there were three classes in the city that held it together—
(441a) the moneymaking, the auxiliary, and the deliberative—is there also this
third element in the soul, the spirited kind, which is the natural auxiliary of
the rationally calculating element, if it has not been corrupted by bad
upbringing?

GLAUCON: There must be a third.

SOCRATES: Yes, provided, at any rate, that it can be shown to be as distinct
from the rationally calculating element as it was shown to be from the
appetitive one.

GLAUCON: But it is not difﬁcult to show that. After all, one can see it even
in small children: they are full of spirit right from birth, but as for rational
calculation, some of them seem to me never to possess it, while the masses
(b) do so quite late.

SOCRATES: Yes, by Zeus, you put that really well. Besides, one can see in
animals that what you say is true. But, in addition to that, our earlier quota-
tion from Homer also bears it out: “He struck his chest and spoke to his
heart.”24 You see, in it Homer clearly presents what has calculated about
(c) better and worse, rebuking what is irrationally angry as though it were
something different.

GLAUCON: That’s exactly right.

SOCRATES: Well, we have had a difﬁcult swim through all that, and we are
pretty much agreed that the same classes as are in the city are in the soul of
each individual, and an equal number of them too.

GLAUCON: That’s true.

SOCRATES: Then doesn’t it already necessarily follow that the private indi-
vidual is wise in the same way and because of the same element as is the
city?

GLAUCON: Of course.
[23]: 439e5.

[24]: Odyssey 20.17. See 390d.

SOCRATES: And that the city is courageous in the same way and because
(d) of the same element as is the private individual? And that in everything else
that pertains to virtue, both are alike?

GLAUCON: Necessarily.

SOCRATES: And so, Glaucon, I take it we will also say that a man is just in
exactly the same way as is a city.

GLAUCON: That too follows with absolute necessity.

SOCRATES: But we surely have not forgotten that the city was just because
each of the three classes in it does its own work.

GLAUCON: I do not think we have.

SOCRATES: We should also bear in mind, then, that in the case of each one
of us as well, the one in whom each of the elements does its own job will
(e) be just and do his own job.

GLAUCON: Certainly.

SOCRATES: Then isn’t it appropriate for the rationally calculating element
to rule, since it is really wise and exercises foresight on behalf of the whole
soul; and for the spirited kind to obey it and be its ally?

GLAUCON: Of course.

SOCRATES: Now, as we were saying, isn’t it a mixture of musical and phys-
ical training that makes these elements concordant, tightening and nurtur-
(442a) ing the ﬁrst with ﬁne words and learning, while relaxing, soothing, and
making gentle the second by means of harmony and rhythm?

GLAUCON: Yes, exactly.

SOCRATES: And these two elements, having been trained in this way and
having truly learned their own jobs and been educated, will be put in
charge of the appetitive element—the largest one in each person’s soul and,
by nature, the most insatiable for money.They will watch over it to see that
it does not get so ﬁlled with the so-called pleasures of the body that it
becomes big and strong, and no longer does its own job but attempts to
(b) enslave and rule over the classes it is not ﬁtted to rule, thereby overturning
the whole life of anyone in whom it occurs.

GLAUCON: Yes, indeed.

SOCRATES: And wouldn’t these two elements also do the ﬁnest job of
guarding the whole soul and body against external enemies—the one by
deliberating, the other by ﬁghting, following the ruler, and using its cour-
age to carry out the things on which the former had decided?

GLAUCON: Yes, they would.

SOCRATES: I imagine, then, that we call each individual courageous
because of the latter part—that is, when the part of him that is spirited in
kind preserves through pains and pleasures the pronouncements of reason25
(c)
about what should inspire terror and what should not.

GLAUCON: That’s right.

SOCRATES: But we call him wise, surely, because of the small part that
rules in him, makes those pronouncements, and has within it the knowl-
edge of what is advantageous—both for each part and for the whole, the
community composed of all three.

GLAUCON: Yes, indeed.

SOCRATES: What about temperance? Isn’t he temperate because of the
friendly and concordant relations between these same things: namely, when
both the ruler and its two subjects share the belief that the rationally calcu-
(d) lating element should rule, and do not engage in faction against it?

GLAUCON: Temperance in a city and in a private individual is certainly
nothing other than that.

SOCRATES: But surely, now, a person will be just because of what we have
so often described and in the way we have so often described.

GLAUCON: Necessarily.

SOCRATES: Well, then, has our justice become in any way blurred? Does it
look like anything other than the very thing we found in the city?

GLAUCON: It doesn’t seem so to me, at least.

SOCRATES: We could make perfectly sure, if there is still anything in our
(e) souls that disputes this, by applying everyday tests to it.

GLAUCON: Which ones?

SOCRATES: For example, if we had to come to an agreement about
whether a man similar in nature and training to this city of ours had embez-
zled gold or silver he had accepted for deposit, who do you think would
consider him more likely to have done so rather than men of a different
(443a) sort?

GLAUCON: No one.

SOCRATES: And would he have anything to do with temple robberies,26
thefts, or betrayals of friends in private life or of cities in public life?

GLAUCON: No, nothing.

SOCRATES: And he would be in no way untrustworthy when it came to
promises or other agreements.

[25]: Reading toË lÒgou with Adam.

[26]: See 344b3 note.

GLAUCON: How could he be?

SOCRATES: And surely adultery, disrespect for parents, and neglect of the
gods would be more characteristic of any other sort of person than of this
one.

GLAUCON: Of any other sort, indeed.

SOCRATES: And isn’t the reason for all this the fact that each element
(b) within him does its own job where ruling and being ruled are concerned?

GLAUCON: Yes, that and nothing else.

SOCRATES: Are you still looking for justice to be something besides this
power that produces men and cities of the sort we have described?

GLAUCON: No, by Zeus, I am not.

SOCRATES: The dream we had has been completely fulﬁlled, then—I
mean the suspicion we expressed that right from the beginning, when we
were founding the city, we had, with the help of some god, chanced to hit
upon the origin and pattern of justice.27
(c)
GLAUCON: Absolutely.

SOCRATES: So, Glaucon, it really was—which is why it was so helpful—a
sort of image of justice, this principle that it is right for someone who is, by
nature, a shoemaker to practice shoemaking and nothing else, for a carpen-
ter to practice carpentry, and the same for all the others.

GLAUCON: Apparently so.

SOCRATES: And in truth, justice is, it seems, something of this sort.Yet it is
not concerned with someone’s doing his own job on the outside. On the
contrary, it is concerned with what is inside; with himself, really, and the
(d) things that are his own. It means that he does not allow the elements in him
each to do the job of some other, or the three sorts of elements in his soul
to meddle with one another. Instead, he regulates well what is really his
own, rules himself, puts himself in order, becomes his own friend, and har-
monizes the three elements together, just as if they were literally the three
deﬁning notes of an octave—lowest, highest, and middle—as well as any
others that may be in between. He binds together all of these and, from
(e) having been many, becomes entirely one, temperate and harmonious.Then
and only then should he turn to action, whether it is to do something con-
cerning the acquisition of wealth or concerning the care of his body, or
even something political, or concerning private contracts. In all these areas,
he considers and calls just and ﬁne the action that preserves this inner har-
mony and helps achieve it,28 and wisdom the knowledge that oversees such

[27]: 432d2–433b4.

[28]: Cf. 338e1–339a4.

action; and he considers and calls unjust any action that destroys this har-
mony, and ignorance the belief that oversees it.29
(444a)
GLAUCON: That’s absolutely true, Socrates.

SOCRATES: Well, then, if we claim to have found the just man, the just
city, and what justice really is in them, we won’t, I imagine, be thought to
be telling a complete lie.

GLAUCON: No, by Zeus, we certainly won’t.

SOCRATES: Shall we claim it, then?

GLAUCON: Yes, let’s.

SOCRATES: So be it, then. I take it we must look for injustice next.

GLAUCON: Clearly.
(b) SOCRATES: Mustn’t it, in turn, be a kind of faction among those three—
(a) their meddling and interfering with one another’s jobs; the rebellion of
part of the soul against the whole in order to rule in it inappropriately, since
its nature suits it to be a slave of the ruling class.30 We will say something

like that, I imagine, and that their disorder and wandering is injustice,
licentiousness, cowardice, ignorance, and, in a word, the whole of vice.

GLAUCON: That is precisely what they are.
(c) SOCRATES: Doing unjust actions, then, and being unjust; and, the oppo-
site, doing just ones—they all surely become clear at once, don’t they, pro-
vided that both injustice and justice are also clear?

GLAUCON: What do you mean?

SOCRATES: That they do not differ in any way from healthy actions and
unhealthy ones, that what the latter are in the body, they are in the soul.

GLAUCON: In what respect?

SOCRATES: Surely, healthy actions engender health, unhealthy ones disease.

GLAUCON: Yes.

SOCRATES: Well, doesn’t doing just actions also engender justice, unjust
(d) ones injustice?

GLAUCON: Necessarily.

SOCRATES: But to produce health is to put the elements that are in the
body in their natural relations of mastering and being mastered by one
another; while to produce disease is to establish a relation of ruling and
being ruled by one another that is contrary to nature.

[29]: The difference between knowledge (epistêmê) and belief (doxa) is explored at
475d1–480a13.

[30]: Reading douleÊein t“ toË érxikoË g°nouw with Adam.

GLAUCON: That’s right.

SOCRATES: Doesn’t it follow, then, that to produce justice is to establish
the elements in the soul in a natural relation of mastering and being mas-
tered by one another, while to produce injustice is to establish a relation of
ruling and being ruled by one another that is contrary to nature?

GLAUCON: Absolutely.

SOCRATES: Virtue, then, so it seems, is a sort of health, a ﬁne and good
(e) state of the soul; whereas vice seems to be a shameful disease and weakness.

GLAUCON: That’s right.

SOCRATES: And don’t ﬁne practices lead to the possession of virtue,
shameful ones to vice?

GLAUCON: Necessarily.

SOCRATES: So it now remains, it seems, for us to consider whether it is
(445a) more proﬁtable to do just actions, engage in ﬁne practices, and be just,
whether one is known to be so or not; or to do injustice and be unjust,
provided that one does not have to pay the penalty and become a better
person as a result of being punished.

GLAUCON: But, Socrates, that question seems to me, at least, to have
become ridiculous, now that the two have been shown to be as we
described. Life does not seem worth living when the body’s natural consti-
tution is ruined, not even if one has food and drink of every sort, all the
money in the world, and every political ofﬁce imaginable. So how—even if
(b) one could do whatever one wished, except what would liberate one from
vice and injustice and make one acquire justice and virtue—could it be
worth living when the natural constitution of the very thing by which we
live31 is ruined and in turmoil?

SOCRATES: Yes, it is ridiculous. All the same, since in fact we have reached
(a) point from which we can see with the utmost clarity, as it were, that these
things are so, we must not give up.

GLAUCON: That’s absolutely the last thing we should do.

SOCRATES: Come up here, then, so that you can see how many kinds of
(c) vice there are—the ones, at any rate, that are worth seeing.

GLAUCON: I am following. Just tell me.32
SOCRATES: Well, from the vantage point, so to speak, that we have reached
in our argument, it seems to me that there is one kind of virtue and an
unlimited number of kinds of vice, four of which are worth mentioning.

[31]: I.e., the soul. See 353d9–10.

[32]: See 432c3–4.

GLAUCON: What do you mean?

SOCRATES: It seems likely that there are as many types of soul as there are
types of political constitution of a speciﬁc kind.

GLAUCON: How many is that?
(d) SOCRATES: Five types of constitution, and ﬁve of soul.

GLAUCON: Tell me what they are.

SOCRATES: I will tell you that one type would be the constitution we have
been describing. However, there are two ways of referring to it: if one out-
standing man emerges among the rulers, it is called a kingship; if more than
one, it is called an aristocracy.

GLAUCON: That’s true.

SOCRATES: Well, then, that is one of the kinds I had in mind.You see,
whether many arise or just one, they won’t change any of the laws of the
(e) city that are worth mentioning, since they will have been brought up and
educated in the way we described.

GLAUCON: No, they probably won’t.
