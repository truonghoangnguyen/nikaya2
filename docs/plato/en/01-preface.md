# *Preface*
I have been a student of the Republic since I ﬁrst encountered it as an
undergraduate at Trinity College, Dublin. In 1988 I published a book about
it (Philosopher-Kings). Four years later, I published a revision of G. M. A.

Grube’s excellent translation. Perhaps I should have rested content with
that, but my desire to have a Republic translation of my own proved too
strong.The fruit of ﬁve years’ work, it is now in print. Naturally, I hope it
improves on existing translations. If so, I have their producers largely to
thank. Certainly, I have ransacked them for assistance. Tom Grifﬁth has
helped greatly, Robin Waterﬁeld too, and also (in the case of Books 5 and
10) Stephen Halliwell. Over the years, my respect has grown for earlier
translations—for that of George Grube, from which I learned a huge
amount, but also for those of Allan Bloom and Paul Shorey.

Every translation, even the most self-consciously and ﬂat-footedly slavish,
is somewhat interpretative.There is no avoiding that. But I have tried to make
this one as uninterpretative and close to the original as possible. One con-
scious deviation from strict accuracy, however, will be obvious at a glance.

The Republic is largely in reported speech. Socrates is relating a conversation
he had in the past. But I have cast his report as an explicit dialogue in direct
(a) speech, with identiﬁed speakers. In the Theaetetus, Plato has Eucleides adopt
similar stratagem. “This is the book,” he says to Terpsion; “You see, I have
written it out like this: I have not made Socrates relate the conversation as he
related it to me, but I represent him as speaking directly to the persons with
whom he said he had this conversation.” Decades of teaching the Republic
have persuaded me that the minimal loss in literalness involved in adopting
Eucleides’ stratagem is more than made up for in readability and intelligibility.

I renew my gratitude to John Cooper for his always judicious advice, and
to Paul Woodruff for his. I am also grateful to the publisher’s readers, Chris-
topher Rowe and the team of Patrick Miller and Christopher Childers.The
latter—in particular—saved me from numerous errors and omissions. My
debt to their care and scholarship is unrepayable. I am grateful to Hackett
Publishing Company itself for trusting me with what is, in many ways, its
ﬂagship text; to my editor, Deborah Wilkes, for her encouragement and
support; to Jenevieve Maerker for her help with the Introduction and, with
Abigail Coyle, for the cover design. Many warm thanks, ﬁnally, to Janet
Zweig for suggesting the wonderfully appropriate cover photograph.
