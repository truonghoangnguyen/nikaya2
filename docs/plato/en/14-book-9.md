# *Book 9*
SOCRATES’ NARRATION CONTINUES:
(571a) SOCRATES: The tyrannical man himself remains to be investigated: how he
evolves from a democratic one, what he is like once he has come to exist,
and whether the way he lives is wretched or blessedly happy.

ADEIMANTUS: Yes, he still remains.

SOCRATES: Do you know what else I still miss?

ADEIMANTUS: What?

SOCRATES: I do not think we have adequately distinguished the nature
and number of our appetites.1 And if that subject is not adequately dealt
(b) with, our investigation will lack clarity.

ADEIMANTUS: Well, isn’t now as ﬁne a time as any?

SOCRATES: It certainly is. So, consider what I want to look at in them. It
is this: among unnecessary pleasures and appetites, there are some that seem
to me to be lawless.These are probably present in all of us, but they are held
in check by the laws and by our better appetites allied with reason. In a few
people they have been eliminated entirely or only a few weak ones remain,
(c) while in others they are stronger and more numerous.

ADEIMANTUS: Which ones do you mean?

SOCRATES: The ones that wake up when we are asleep, whenever the rest
of the soul—the rational, gentle, and ruling element—slumbers. Then the
bestial and savage part, full of food or drink, comes alive, casts off sleep, and
seeks to go and gratify its own characteristic instincts.You know it will dare
to do anything in such a state, released and freed from all shame and wis-
dom. In fantasy, it does not shrink from trying to have sex with a mother or
(d) with anyone else—man, god, or beast. It will commit any foul murder, and
there is no food it refuses to eat. In a word, it does not refrain from any-
thing, no matter how foolish or shameful.

ADEIMANTUS: That’s absolutely true.

SOCRATES: On the other hand, I suppose someone who keeps himself
healthy and temperate will awaken his rational element before going to
[1]: A topic brieﬂy discussed at 558d4–559d2.

sleep and feast it on ﬁne arguments and investigations, which he has
brought to an agreed conclusion within himself. As for the appetitive ele-
(e) ment, he neither starves nor overfeeds it, so it will slumber and not disturb
the best element with its pleasure or pain but will leave it alone, just by
(572a) itself and pure, to investigate and reach out for the perception of some-
thing—whether past, present, or future—that it does not know. He soothes
the spirited element in a similar way and does not get angry and fall asleep
with his spirit still aroused. And when he has calmed these two elements
and stimulated the third, in which wisdom resides, he takes his rest.You
know this is the state in which he most readily grasps the truth and in
(b) which the visions appearing in his dreams are least lawless.

ADEIMANTUS: I completely agree.

SOCRATES: Well, we have been led a bit astray and said a bit too much.

What we want to pay attention to is this: there are appetites of a terrible,
savage, and lawless kind in everyone—even in those of us who seem to be
entirely moderate. This surely becomes clear in sleep. Do you think I am
talking sense? Do you agree with me?

ADEIMANTUS: Yes, I do agree.

SOCRATES: Now, recall what we said the democratic man is like.2 He was

(c) the result, we presumed, of a childhood upbringing by a thrifty father who
honored only appetites that made money and despised the unnecessary
ones whose objects are amusement and showing off. Isn’t that right?

ADEIMANTUS: Yes.

SOCRATES: And by associating with more sophisticated men who are full
of the appetites we just described, he starts to indulge in every kind of arro-
gance and adopt their kind of behavior, because of his hatred of his father’s
thrift. But, since he has a better nature than his corrupters, he is pulled in
both directions and settles in the middle between their two ways of life.And
(d) enjoying each in what he takes to be moderation, he lives a life that is nei-
ther illiberal nor lawless, transformed now from an oligarch to a democrat.

ADEIMANTUS: Yes, that was—and still is—our belief about someone like
that.

SOCRATES: Suppose, then, that this man has now in turn become older
and has a son who is also brought up in his father’s way of life.

ADEIMANTUS: I will.

SOCRATES: Suppose, too, that the same things happen to him as happened
to his father: he is led into all the kinds of lawlessness that those leading him
(e) call total freedom. His father and the rest of his family come to the aid of
[2]: 558c–562a2.

the appetites that are in the middle, while the others help the opposite
ones. And when these terrible enchanters and tyrant-makers have no hope
of keeping hold of the young man in any other way, they contrive to
implant a powerful passion in him as the popular leader of those idle and
(573a) proﬂigate appetites—a sort-of great, winged drone. Or do you think pas-
sion is ever anything else in such people?

ADEIMANTUS: I certainly do not think it is.

SOCRATES: And when the other appetites come buzzing around—ﬁlled
with incense, perfumes, wreaths, wine, and all the other pleasures found in
such company, they feed the drone, make it grow as large as possible, and
plant the sting of longing in it.Then this popular leader of the soul adopts
(b) madness as its bodyguard and is stung to frenzy. If it ﬁnds any beliefs or
appetites in the man that are regarded as good or are still moved by shame,
it destroys them and throws them out, until it has purged him of temper-
ance and ﬁlled him with imported madness.

ADEIMANTUS: You have perfectly described how a tyrannical man comes
to exist.

SOCRATES: Is that, then, why Passion has long been called a tyrant?

ADEIMANTUS: Probably so.

SOCRATES: And hasn’t a drunken man, my friend, something of a tyranni-
(c) cal cast of mind, too?

ADEIMANTUS: He has.

SOCRATES: And of course someone who is mad and deranged attempts to
rule not only human beings, but gods as well, and expects to be able to rule
them.

ADEIMANTUS: Of course.

SOCRATES: A man becomes tyrannical in the precise sense, then, you mar-
velous fellow, when his nature or his practices or both together lead him to
drunkenness, passion, and melancholia.

ADEIMANTUS: Absolutely.

SOCRATES: So, that, it seems, is how a tyrannical man comes to exist.

Now, what is his life like?
(d) ADEIMANTUS: Why don’t you tell me, as askers of riddles usually do?

SOCRATES: I will tell you.You see, I think someone in whom the tyrant of
Passion dwells, and in whom it serves as captain of everything in the soul,
next goes in for festivals, revelries, luxuries, girlfriends, and all that sort of
thing.

ADEIMANTUS: Inevitably.

SOCRATES: And don’t lots of terrible appetites sprout up each day and
night beside it, creating needs for all sorts of things?

ADEIMANTUS: Indeed, they do.

SOCRATES: So, any income someone like that has is soon spent.

ADEIMANTUS: Of course.

SOCRATES: And the next thing, surely, is borrowing and expenditure of
(e) capital.

ADEIMANTUS: What else?

SOCRATES: And when everything is gone, won’t the violent crowd of
appetites that have nested within him inevitably shout in protest? And when
people of this sort are driven by the stings of these other appetites, but par-
ticularly of Passion itself, which leads all the others as if they were its body-
guard, stung to frenzy, don’t they look to see who possesses anything that
(574a) can be taken from him by deceit or force?

ADEIMANTUS: Certainly.

SOCRATES: He must take it from every source, then, or live in great suffer-
ing and pain.

ADEIMANTUS: He must.

SOCRATES: And just as the late-coming pleasures within him do better
than the older ones and steal away their satisfactions, won’t he himself,
young as he is, think he deserves to do better3 than his father and mother?

And if he has spent his own share, won’t he try to take some of his father’s
wealth by converting it to his own use?

ADEIMANTUS: Of course.
(b) SOCRATES: And if his parents resist him, won’t he ﬁrst try to steal it and
deceive them?

ADEIMANTUS: Certainly.

SOCRATES: And if he cannot, won’t he next try to seize it by force?

ADEIMANTUS: I suppose so.

SOCRATES: And if, you amazing man, the old man and woman stand their
(a) ground and put up a ﬁght, would he take care and be reluctant to act like
tyrant?

ADEIMANTUS: I am not very optimistic about the parents of someone like
that!

SOCRATES: But in the name of Zeus, Adeimantus, do you really think that
for the sake of his latest love, an unnecessary girlfriend, he would strike his
[3]: See Glossary of Terms s.v. do better.

mother, who is his oldest and necessary friend? Or that for the sake of his
(c) latest and unnecessary boyfriend, who is in the bloom of youth, he would
strike his aged and necessary father, the oldest of his friends, who is no
longer in the bloom of youth? Or that he would enslave his parents to
them, if he brought them into the same house?

ADEIMANTUS: Yes, by Zeus, he would.

SOCRATES: It seems to be a great blessing to produce a tyrannical son!

ADEIMANTUS: It certainly does!

SOCRATES: What happens to someone like that when the possessions of
(d) his father and mother give out and the swarm of pleasures now inside him
has grown dense? Won’t he ﬁrst try to break into someone’s house or snatch
the cloak of someone walking late at night? Next, won’t he try to clean out
some temple? And in the course of all that, his old childhood beliefs about
ﬁne or shameful things—beliefs that are accounted just—are mastered by
the new ones that have been released from slavery and, as the bodyguard of
Passion, hold sway along with it.These are the ones that used to be freed in
sleep as a dream, when he himself, since he was still subject to the laws and
(e) his father, had a democratic constitution within him. But under the tyr-
anny of Passion, what he used to become occasionally in his dreams he has
now become permanently while awake, and so there is no terrible murder,
no food, and no act from which he will refrain. On the contrary, Passion
(575a) lives like a tyrant within him in complete anarchy and lawlessness, as his
sole ruler, and drives him, as if he were a city, to dare anything that will
provide sustenance for itself and the unruly mob around it—some of which
have come in from the outside as a result of his bad associates, while others
have come from within, freed and let loose by his own bad habits. Isn’t this
the life such a man leads?

ADEIMANTUS: It is.

SOCRATES: And if there are only a few men like that in a city, and the
(b) majority of the others are temperate, they emigrate in order to become the
bodyguard of some other tyrant or serve as paid auxiliaries if there happens
to be a war somewhere. But if they chance to live in a time of peace and
calm, they stay right there in the city and cause lots of little evils.

ADEIMANTUS: What sort of evils do you mean?

SOCRATES: They steal, break into houses, snatch purses, steal clothes, rob
temples, and kidnap people. Sometimes, if they are capable speakers, they
become sycophants and bear false witness and accept bribes.4
(a) ADEIMANTUS: You mean they are small evils—provided there are only
(c) few such people.

[4]: See Glossary of Terms s.v. sycophants.

SOCRATES: Yes. After all, small evils are small by comparison to big ones.

And when it comes to producing corruption and misery in a city, all these
evils together do not—as the saying goes—come within a mile of a tyrant.
(a) But when you get a large number of these people and their followers in
city, and they become aware of their numbers, they are the ones who—
together with the foolishness of the people—create the tyrant out of the
(d) one among them who has in his soul the greatest and strongest tyrant of all.

ADEIMANTUS: Naturally, since he would be the most tyrannical.

SOCRATES: That’s if they submit willingly. But if the city doesn’t put itself
in his hands, then just as he once chastised his mother and father, he will
now punish his fatherland in the same way, if he can, bringing in new
friends and making and keeping his once beloved motherland—as the
Cretans call it—or fatherland their slaves. And that is surely the end at
which the appetites of a man like that aim.
(e) ADEIMANTUS: It most certainly is.

SOCRATES: So, isn’t this what such men are like in private life, before they
start to rule? In the ﬁrst place, don’t they associate with ﬂatterers who are
ready to do anything to serve them? Or, if they need something from
someone themselves, won’t they grovel and willingly engage in any sort of
(576a) posturing, the way slaves do? But once they get what they need, isn’t it a
different story altogether?

ADEIMANTUS: Yes, completely different.

SOCRATES: So, those with a tyrannical nature live their entire lives without
ever being friends with anyone, always masters to one man or slaves to
another, but never getting a taste of freedom or true friendship.

ADEIMANTUS: Exactly.

SOCRATES: Wouldn’t we be right to call people like that untrustworthy?

ADEIMANTUS: Of course.

SOCRATES: And as unjust as anyone can be—assuming we were right in
(b) our earlier conclusions about what justice is like.

ADEIMANTUS: And we certainly were right.

SOCRATES: Let’s sum up the worst type of man, then. He is surely the one
who, when awake, is like the dreaming person we described earlier.5

ADEIMANTUS: Exactly.

SOCRATES: And he evolves from someone who, since he is by nature most
tyrannical, achieves sole rule. And the longer he lives as tyrant, the more
like that he becomes.

[5]: See 571c–d.

> *“Inevitably,” said Glaucon, taking over the argument.*
SOCRATES: Well, then, won’t the one who is plainly worst also be plainly
(c) most wretched? And the one who for the longest time is most a tyrant,
won’t he also be most wretched for the longest time, if truth be told?

Though the views of the masses6 on the subject are naturally also many.

GLAUCON: All that, at any rate, must be true.
(a) SOCRATES: Doesn’t a tyrannical man correspond to and most resemble
city ruled by a tyrant, a democratic man a democratically ruled city, and
similarly with the others?

GLAUCON: Of course.

SOCRATES: And the comparison between city and city, as regards their vir-
tue and happiness, isn’t it the same as the comparison between man and man?
(d) GLAUCON: Certainly.

SOCRATES: As regards virtue, then, how does a city ruled by a tyrant com-
pare to a city of the sort we described ﬁrst that is ruled by a king?

GLAUCON: They are absolute opposites: one is the best, and the other is
the worst.

SOCRATES: I won’t ask you which is which, since it is obvious. But as
regards happiness and wretchedness, is your judgment the same or differ-
ent? And let’s not become dazzled by looking at the tyrant—since he is just
one man—or at the few who surround him. Instead, as is necessary, let’s go
in and study the city as a whole and, when we have gone down and looked
(e) into every corner, only then present what we believe.

GLAUCON: That’s a good suggestion. And it is clear to everyone that there
is no city more wretched than a tyrannical one and none happier than one
ruled by a king.

SOCRATES: Would it also be right, then, to suggest the same thing about
(577a) the men—that the only ﬁt judge of them is someone who can, in thought,
go down into a man’s character and discern it—not someone who sees it
from the outside, the way a child does, and is dazzled by the façade that
tyrants adopt for the outside world, but someone who discerns it ade-
quately? And what if I were to assume that the person we must all listen to
is the one who has this capacity to judge; who has lived in the same house
as a tyrant and witnessed his behavior at home; who has seen how he deals
with each member of his household, when he can best be observed
stripped of his tragic costume;7 and who has also seen how he deals with
(b)
[6]: Literally, the many.

[7]: I.e., the façade referred to earlier. Greek tragedies often had tyrants as characters.

public dangers? Shouldn’t we ask the one who has seen all that to tell us
how the tyrant compares to the others with respect to happiness and
wretchedness?

GLAUCON: That’s also a very good suggestion.

SOCRATES: Then, in order to have someone to answer our questions, do
(a) you want us to pretend that we are among the ones who can make such
judgment, and that we have met tyrannical people already?8
GLAUCON: I certainly do.

SOCRATES: Come on, then, and examine the matter like this for me.
(c) Bearing in mind the resemblance between the city and the man, examine
each in turn and describe its condition.

GLAUCON: What kinds of things do you want me to describe?

SOCRATES: Describe the city ﬁrst.Would you say that a tyrannical city is
free or enslaved?

GLAUCON: As enslaved as it is possible to be.

SOCRATES: Yet you can surely see masters and free people in it.

GLAUCON: I can certainly see a small group of people like that. But pretty
much the whole population, and the best part of it, is shamefully and
wretchedly enslaved.
(d) SOCRATES: If a man and his city are similar, then, mustn’t the same struc-
ture exist in him, too? Mustn’t his soul be full of slavery and illiberality,
with those same parts of it enslaved, while a small part, the most wicked
and most insane, is master?

GLAUCON: It must.

SOCRATES: Will you describe such a soul as enslaved, then, or as free?

GLAUCON: Enslaved, of course.

SOCRATES: And, to go back, isn’t the enslaved, tyrannical city least able to
do what it wishes?

GLAUCON: By far the least.
(e) SOCRATES: So, a tyrannical soul will also least do what it wishes—I am
talking about the soul as a whole—and will be full of disorder and regret,
since it is always forcibly driven by a gadﬂy.

GLAUCON: Of course.

SOCRATES: Rich or poor? Which must a tyrannical city be?

GLAUCON: Poor.

[8]: Plato spent time with Dionysius I, tyrant of Sicily.

(578a) SOCRATES: So, a tyrannical soul, too, must always be poor and insatiable.

GLAUCON: It must.

SOCRATES: What about fear? Mustn’t a city of this sort and a man of this
sort be ﬁlled with it?

GLAUCON: They certainly must.

SOCRATES: And do you think you will ﬁnd more wailing, groaning,
lamenting, or painful suffering in any other city?

GLAUCON: No.

SOCRATES: What about in a man? Do you think such things are more
common in anyone than in this tyrannical man, maddened by his appetites
and passions?

GLAUCON: How could I?

SOCRATES: I imagine it is in view of all these things, then, as well as others
(b) like them, that you judged this city to be the most wretched of cities.

GLAUCON: And wasn’t I right?

SOCRATES: Yes, of course. But how, again, do you describe the tyrannical
man in view of these same things?

GLAUCON: He is by far the most wretched of them all.

SOCRATES: There your description is no longer right.

GLAUCON: How so?

SOCRATES: This man, I think, is not yet the most wretched.

GLAUCON: Then who is?

SOCRATES: Presumably, you will regard this next one as even more
wretched.

GLAUCON: What one?

SOCRATES: The tyrannical man who does not live out his life as a private
(c) individual, but is unlucky, in that some misfortune gives him the opportu-
nity of becoming an actual tyrant.

GLAUCON: On the basis of what we have already said, I infer that what
you are saying is true.

SOCRATES: Yes. But it is not good enough to believe these claims; one
must carefully examine someone like that by means of argument. After
all, the investigation concerns the most important thing—a good life and
(a) bad one.9
GLAUCON: That’s absolutely right.

[9]: See 344e1–3.

SOCRATES: So, consider, then, whether there is anything in what I say.You
(d) see, I think we should investigate him on the basis of the following.

GLAUCON: What?

SOCRATES: On the basis of each and every one of the wealthy private citi-
zens in our cities who own many slaves. For they resemble a tyrant in ruling
over many, although the number ruled by the tyrant is different.

GLAUCON: It is different.

SOCRATES: You know, then, that these people feel secure and do not fear
their slaves.

GLAUCON: Of what have they to be afraid, after all?

SOCRATES: Nothing. But do you know why?

GLAUCON: Yes. Because the whole city is ready to defend each of its pri-
vate citizens.

SOCRATES: That’s right. But now, suppose some god were to lift one of
(e) these men, who has ﬁfty or more slaves, out of the city, and put him
(a) down—with his wife, his children, his slaves, and his other property—in
deserted place, where no free men could come to his assistance? Can you
imagine the sort and amount of fear he would feel that he and his wife and
children would be killed by his slaves?

GLAUCON: It would be huge, if you ask me.

SOCRATES: Wouldn’t he at that point be compelled to start fawning on
(579a) some of his slaves, promising them all sorts of things and setting them
free—even though there was nothing he wanted to do less—and wouldn’t
he turn out to be a ﬂatterer of slaves?

GLAUCON: He would have to be. Otherwise, he would be killed.

SOCRATES: Now, suppose the god were to settle many other neighbors
around him who would not tolerate anyone claiming to be master of
another, but if they caught such a person, would inﬂict the most extreme
punishments on him?

GLAUCON: I suppose he would be in even worse trouble, since he would
(b) be surrounded by nothing but enemies.

SOCRATES: So, isn’t this, then, the kind of prison in which the tyrant is
held—the one whose nature we have described, ﬁlled with multifarious
fears and passions? Though his soul is really greedy, he is the only one in the
city who cannot go abroad or look at the sights at which other free people
yearn to look. Instead, he is mostly stuck in house, living like a woman,10
(c) envying any other citizen who goes abroad and sees some good thing.

[10]: See 451d7 note.

GLAUCON: Absolutely.

SOCRATES: Isn’t such a harvest of evils, then, a measure of the difference
between a tyrannical man who is badly governed politically on the inside—
whom you judged just now to be most wretched—and one who does not
live out his life as a private individual, but is compelled by some chance to
become an actual tyrant and try to rule others, when he cannot even master
himself? It is as if someone with a body that is sick and cannot master itself
were compelled, not to spend his life in private pursuits, but to compete
(d) and ﬁght with other bodies.

GLAUCON: That’s exactly what he is like.Your description is absolutely
true, Socrates.

SOCRATES: And so, my dear Glaucon, isn’t his condition completely
wretched, and isn’t the life of a tyrant even harsher than the one you judged
to be harshest?

GLAUCON: It certainly is.

SOCRATES: So, in truth, then, and whatever some people may think, a real
tyrant is really a slave to the worst sorts of fawning and slavery, and a ﬂat-
(e) terer of the worst kind of people. He is so far from satisfying his appetites in
any way that he is in the greatest need of most things and truly poor—as is
apparent if one knows how to look at a whole soul. He is full of fear
throughout his life and overﬂowing with convulsions and pains, if in fact
his condition is like that of the city he rules. And it is like it, isn’t it?

GLAUCON: Yes, of course.

SOCRATES: And, in addition, shouldn’t we also attribute to the man the
(580a) qualities we mentioned earlier? We said that he is inevitably envious,
untrustworthy, unjust, friendless, impious, and a host and nurse to every
(a) kind of vice; that ruling makes him even more so than before; and that, as
consequence, he is extremely unfortunate and goes on to make those near
him so.

GLAUCON: No one with any sense could possibly contradict that.

SOCRATES: Come on, then, and tell me now at last, like the judge who
makes the ﬁnal decision,11 who you believe is ﬁrst in happiness and who
(b)
second, and judge the others similarly, making ﬁve altogether—kingly,
timocratic, oligarchic, democratic, tyrannical.

GLAUCON: That’s an easy judgment.You see, I rank them in the order of
their appearance, just as if they were choruses, both in virtue and vice and
in happiness and its opposite.

[11]: The reference is to the way plays were judged at dramatic festivals in Athens. A
herald announced the results.

SOCRATES: Shall we, then, hire a herald, or shall I myself announce that
the son of Ariston12 has given as his verdict that the best and most just is the
(c) most happy, and that he is the one who is most kingly and rules like a king
over himself; whereas the worst and most unjust is the most wretched, and
he, again, is the one who, because he is most tyrannical, is the greatest
tyrant over himself and his city?

GLAUCON: You have announced it!

SOCRATES: And shall I add that it holds whether or not their characters
remain hidden from all human beings and gods?13
GLAUCON: Do add it.

SOCRATES: Well, then, that is one of our demonstrations. But look at this
(d) second one and see if you think there is anything in it.

GLAUCON: What is it?

SOCRATES: In just the way a city is divided into three classes, the soul of
each person is also divided in three. That is the reason I think there is
another demonstration.

GLAUCON: What is it?

SOCRATES: The following. It seems to me that the three also have three
kinds of pleasure, one peculiar to each. The same holds of appetites and
kinds of rule.

GLAUCON: How do you mean?

SOCRATES: One element, we say, is that with which a person learns;
another, that with which he feels anger. As for the third, because it is mul-
tiform, we had no one special name for it but named it after the biggest and
(e) strongest thing it has in it. I mean we called it the appetitive element
because of the intensity of its appetites for food, drink, sex, and all the
things that go along with them. We also called it the money-loving ele-
ment,14 because such appetites are most easily satisﬁed by means of money.
(581a)
GLAUCON: And we were right.

SOCRATES: So, if we said its pleasure and love are for proﬁt, wouldn’t that
best bring it together under one heading for the purposes of our argument
and make clear to us what we mean when we speak of this part of the soul?

And would we be right in calling it money-loving and proﬁt-loving?

GLAUCON: I think so, anyway.

[12]: Glaucon, but also, perhaps, his brother Plato.

[13]: See 367e1–5, 612a8–b5.

[14]: At 553c5.

SOCRATES: What about the spirited element? Don’t we say that its whole
aim is always mastery, victory, and high repute?
(b) GLAUCON: Certainly.

SOCRATES: Then wouldn’t it strike the right note for us to call it victory-
loving and honor-loving?

GLAUCON: The absolutely right one.

SOCRATES: But surely it is clear to everyone that the element we learn
with is always wholly straining to know where the truth lies, and that of the
three it cares least for money and reputation.

GLAUCON: By far the least.

SOCRATES: Wouldn’t it be appropriate, then, for us to call it learning
loving and philosophic?

GLAUCON: Of course.

SOCRATES: And doesn’t it rule in some people’s souls, while one of the
(c) others—whichever it happens to be—rules in other people’s?

GLAUCON: Yes.

SOCRATES: And isn’t that why we say there are three primary types of
people, philosophic, victory-loving, and proﬁt-loving?

GLAUCON: Absolutely.

SOCRATES: And also three kinds of pleasure, one assigned to each of them?

GLAUCON: Exactly.

SOCRATES: You realize, then, that if you chose to ask each of these three
types of people in turn to tell you which of their lives is most pleasant, each
would give the highest praise to his own? Won’t the moneymaker say that,
compared to that of making a proﬁt, the pleasures of being honored or of
(d) learning are worthless unless there is something in them that makes money?

GLAUCON: True.

SOCRATES: What about the honor-lover? Doesn’t he think the pleasure of
making money is vulgar, while the pleasure of learning—except to the
extent that learning brings honor—is smoke and nonsense?

GLAUCON: He does.

SOCRATES: As for the philosopher, what do you suppose he thinks of the
(e) other pleasures in comparison to that of knowing where the truth lies and
always enjoying some variety of it while he is learning? Won’t he think they
are far behind? And won’t he call them really necessary,15 since he would
have no need for them if they were not necessary for life?

[15]: See 559a1–b7.

GLAUCON: He will.We can be sure of that.

SOCRATES: Since the pleasures of each kind and the lives themselves dis-
pute with one another—not about which life is ﬁner or more shameful or
better or worse—but about which is more pleasant and less painful, how
(582a) are we to know which of them is speaking the absolute truth?

GLAUCON: I have no idea how to answer that.

SOCRATES: Consider the matter this way: how should we judge things if
we want to judge them well? Isn’t it by experience, knowledge, and argu-
ment? Or could someone have better criteria than these?

GLAUCON: No, of course not.

SOCRATES: Consider, then. Of the three types of men, which has most
experience of the pleasures we mentioned? Do you think the proﬁt-lover
learns what the truth itself is like, or has more experience of the pleasure of
(b) knowing, than the philosopher does of making a proﬁt?

GLAUCON: There is a big difference between them.You see, the latter has
to have tasted the other kinds of pleasure beginning from childhood. But it
is not necessary for the proﬁt-lover to taste or experience how sweet is the
pleasure of learning the nature of the things that are—and even if he were
eager to, he could not easily do so.

SOCRATES: So, the philosopher is far superior to the proﬁt-lover in his
experience of both kinds of pleasures.
(c) GLAUCON: Very far superior.

SOCRATES: What about compared to the honor-lover? Is he more inexpe-
rienced in the pleasure of being honored than the latter is in the pleasure of
knowing?

GLAUCON: No. Honor comes to all of them, provided they accomplish
their several aims. For the rich man, too, is honored by many people, as
well as are the courageous and the wise ones. So, all have experienced what
the pleasure of being honored is like. But the pleasure pertaining to the
sight of what is cannot be tasted by anyone except the philosopher.

SOCRATES: So, as far as experience goes, then, he is the ﬁnest judge
(d) among the three types of men.

GLAUCON: By far.

SOCRATES: And he alone will have gained his experience with the help of
knowledge.

GLAUCON: Of course.

SOCRATES: Moreover, the tool that should be used to judge is not the tool
of the proﬁt-lover or the honor-lover, but of the philosopher.

GLAUCON: What one is that?

SOCRATES: Surely we said that judgment should be made by means of
arguments. Didn’t we?

GLAUCON: Yes.

SOCRATES: And arguments are, above all, his tool.

GLAUCON: Absolutely.

SOCRATES: If the things being judged were best judged by means of
[15]: wealth and proﬁt, the praise and criticism of the proﬁt-lover would nec-
(e) essarily be closest to the truth.

GLAUCON: It would indeed.

SOCRATES: And if by means of honor, victory, and courage, wouldn’t it be
those of the honor-lover and victory-lover?

GLAUCON: Clearly.

SOCRATES: But since it is by means of experience, knowledge, and argu-
ment?

GLAUCON: The praise of the philosopher and argument-lover must be
closest to the truth.

SOCRATES: So, of the three pleasures, then, the most pleasant would be
(583a) that of the part of the soul with which we learn, and the one of us in
whom it rules has the most pleasant life.

GLAUCON: How could it be otherwise? The knowledgeable person at least
praises with authority when he praises his own life.

SOCRATES: What life and pleasure does the judge say are in second place?

GLAUCON: Clearly, those of the warrior and honor-lover, since they are
closer to his own than those of the moneymaker.

SOCRATES: Then those of the proﬁt-lover come last, apparently.

GLAUCON: Of course.

SOCRATES: Well, then, that makes two in a row. And twice the just person
(b) has defeated the unjust one. Now comes the third, which is dedicated in
Olympic fashion to our savior, Olympian Zeus.16 Observe, then, that the
other pleasures—apart from that of the knowledgeable person—are neither
entirely true nor pure. On the contrary, they are like some sort of illusionist
painting, as I think I have heard some wise person say.Yet, if that were true,
it would be the greatest and most decisive of the overthrows.

[16]: The ﬁrst toast at a banquet was to the Olympian Zeus, the third to our savior,
Zeus. By combining both in a single form of address, Plato seems to be emphasizing
the importance of this ﬁnal proof.

GLAUCON: By far the greatest. But what exactly do you mean?
(c) SOCRATES: I will ﬁnd out, if you answer the questions while I ask them.

GLAUCON: Start asking, then.

SOCRATES: Tell me, then, don’t we say that pain is the opposite of pleasure?

GLAUCON: Yes.

SOCRATES: Isn’t there also a state of feeling neither enjoyment nor pain?

GLAUCON: There is.

SOCRATES: Isn’t it in the middle between these two, a sort of quiet state of
the soul where they are concerned? Or wouldn’t you describe it that way?

GLAUCON: I would.

SOCRATES: So then do you recall the sorts of things ill people say when
they are ill?

GLAUCON: Which ones?

SOCRATES: That nothing is more pleasant than being healthy, but they had
(d) not realized it was most pleasant until they fell ill.

GLAUCON: I do remember that.

SOCRATES: Don’t you also hear people who are in great pain saying that
nothing is more pleasant than the cessation of one’s suffering?

GLAUCON: I do.

SOCRATES: And there are many similar circumstances, I presume, in
which you see people in pain praising not enjoyment, but freedom from
pain, and respite from that sort of thing, as most pleasant.

GLAUCON: Yes. For at such times, the respite presumably becomes pleas-
ant enough to content them.

SOCRATES: And when someone ceases to enjoy something, this respite
(e) from pleasure will be painful.

GLAUCON: Presumably.

SOCRATES: So, the quiet state we just now described as being in between
the two will sometimes be both pain and pleasure.

GLAUCON: Apparently.

SOCRATES: And is it possible for what is neither to become both?

GLAUCON: Not in my view.

SOCRATES: Furthermore, when what is pleasant and what is painful arise
in the soul, they are both a sort of motion, aren’t they?

GLAUCON: Yes.

SOCRATES: And didn’t we see just now that what is neither painful nor
(584a) pleasant is a respite and in the middle between the two?

GLAUCON: Yes, we did.

SOCRATES: How can it be right, then, to think that the absence of pain is
pleasant or the absence of enjoyment painful?

GLAUCON: There’s no way it can be.

SOCRATES: So, it is not right. But when the quiet state is next to what is
painful, it appears pleasant; and when it is next to what is pleasant, it
appears painful. And there is nothing sound in these illusions as far as the
truth about pleasure is concerned. On the contrary, they are a sort of sorcery.

GLAUCON: That’s what the argument suggests, at any rate.

SOCRATES: Well, then, take a look at pleasures that do not derive from
(b) pains, so that you won’t be likely to think that, in their case, it is the nature
of pleasure to be just the cessation of pain or of pain to be just the cessation
of pleasure.

GLAUCON: Where am I to look? What pleasures do you mean?

SOCRATES: There are lots of others, but you might especially want to
think about the pleasures of smell.You see, without being preceded by pain,
they suddenly become incredibly intense. And when they cease, they leave
no pain behind.

GLAUCON: That’s absolutely true.

SOCRATES: So, let’s not be persuaded that pure pleasure is relief from pain,
(c) or pure pain relief from pleasure.

GLAUCON: No, let’s not.

SOCRATES: However, of the so-called pleasures that reach the soul through
the body, pretty much the greatest number—and the most intense ones,
too—are of that kind: they are some sort of relief from pains.

GLAUCON: Yes, they are.

SOCRATES: And aren’t those pleasures and pains of anticipation, which
arise from the expectation of future pleasures or pains, of the same kind?

GLAUCON: They are.
(d) SOCRATES: Do you know what they are like and what they most resemble?

GLAUCON: What?

SOCRATES: Do you think there is such a thing in the natural world as an
up, a down, and a middle?

GLAUCON: I do.

SOCRATES: Don’t you imagine, then, that if someone were brought from
down below to the middle, he would think anything other than that he was
moving upward? And if he stood at the middle and saw where he had come
from, could he possibly think he was anywhere other than the upper
region, since he hadn’t seen the one that is truly up above?

GLAUCON: By Zeus, I do not see how he could think anything else.
(e) SOCRATES: But if he were brought back again, wouldn’t he think he was
being brought down? And wouldn’t he be thinking the truth?

GLAUCON: Of course.

SOCRATES: And wouldn’t all this happen to him because he is inexperi-
enced in what is truly and really up, middle, and down?

GLAUCON: Clearly.

SOCRATES: Would it surprise you, then, if those who are inexperienced in
the truth have unsound beliefs about lots of other things as well—that they
are so disposed toward pleasure, pain, and the middle state that, whenever
(585a) they descend to the painful, they think the truth and really are in pain; but
that, when they ascend from the painful to the middle state, they ﬁrmly
think they have reached fulﬁllment and pleasure? Like people who compare
black to gray without having experienced white, don’t they compare pain
to painlessness while being inexperienced in pleasure, and so get deceived?

GLAUCON: No, by Zeus, it would not surprise me! In fact, I would be
very surprised if it were not like that.

SOCRATES: Think of it this way, then: Aren’t hunger, thirst, and the like
(b) some sort of emptiness related to the state of the body?

GLAUCON: They are.

SOCRATES: And isn’t foolishness and lack of knowledge, in turn, some sort
of emptiness related to the state of the soul?

GLAUCON: It certainly is.

SOCRATES: Aren’t people ﬁlled when they take in nourishment or gain
understanding?

GLAUCON: Of course.

SOCRATES: Does the truer ﬁlling belong to what is less or to what is more?

GLAUCON: Clearly, it belongs to what is more.

SOCRATES: Which of the two types, then, partakes more of pure being?

The sorts belonging to bread, drink, relishes, and nourishment in general?

Or the kind belonging to true belief, knowledge, understanding, and, in
(c) sum, to all of virtue? Judge it this way: what belongs to what is always the
same, immortal, and true, is itself of that sort, and comes to be in something

of that sort—it is more, don’t you think, than what belongs to what is never
the same and mortal, is itself of that kind, and comes to be in something of
that kind?

GLAUCON: Far more.What belongs to what is always the same is far superior.

SOCRATES: And does the being of what is always the same partake any
more of being than of knowledge?17
GLAUCON: Not at all.

SOCRATES: What about of truth?

GLAUCON: Not of it, either.

SOCRATES: And if less of truth, less of being, too?

GLAUCON: Necessarily.

SOCRATES: Isn’t it generally true that the types concerned with the care of
(d) the body partake less in truth and being than do those concerned with the
care of the soul?

GLAUCON: Yes, much less.

SOCRATES: Don’t you think the same holds of the body in comparison to
the soul?

GLAUCON: I do.

SOCRATES: Then isn’t what is ﬁlled with things that are more, and is itself
more, more really ﬁlled than what is ﬁlled with things that are less, and is
itself less?

GLAUCON: Of course.

SOCRATES: So, then, if being ﬁlled with what is appropriate to our nature
is pleasant, what is more ﬁlled with things that are more is more really and
(e) truly caused to enjoy a more true pleasure; whereas what partakes of things
that are less is less truly and surely ﬁlled and partakes of a less trustworthy
and less true pleasure.

GLAUCON: That’s absolutely inevitable.
(586a) SOCRATES: So, those who lack experience of knowledge or virtue, but are
always occupied with feasts and the like, are brought down, apparently, and
then back up to the middle state; and wander in this way throughout their
lives, never reaching beyond this to what is truly higher up, never looking
up at it or brought up to it, never ﬁlled with what really is, and never tast-
ing any stable or pure pleasure. On the contrary, they are always looking
downward like cattle and, with their heads bent over the earth or the din-
ner table, they feed, fatten, and fornicate. And, in order to do better than
[17]: See 477a2–4.

(b) others in these things, they kick and butt with iron horns and hooves, kill-
ing each other, because their desires are insatiable.18 For they aren’t using
things that are to ﬁll the part of themselves that is a thing that is, and a leak-
proof vessel.19
GLAUCON: You have described the life of “the many,” Socrates, just like an
oracle!

SOCRATES: So, isn’t it necessary, then, for these people to live with plea-
sures that are mixed with pains, mere phantoms and illusionist paintings of
true pleasures? And aren’t they so colored by their juxtaposition with one
(c) another that they appear intense, beget mad passions for themselves in the
foolish, and are fought over—as Stesichorus tells us the phantom of Helen
was fought over at Troy—through ignorance of the truth?20

GLAUCON: Something like that must be what happens.

SOCRATES: Mustn’t similar things happen to someone who succeeds in
satisfying the spirited element? Mustn’t his love of honor be so colored by
envy, his love of victory by violence, and his spiritedness by peevishness,21
(d) that he pursues the satisfactions of honor, victory, and spiritedness without
rational calculation or understanding?

GLAUCON: The same sorts of things must happen with regard to that ele-
ment, too.

SOCRATES: Can’t we conﬁdently assert, then, that, even where the desires
of the proﬁt-loving and honor-loving parts are concerned, those that fol-
low knowledge and argument, and pursue with their help the pleasures that
wisdom prescribes, will attain—to the degree that they can attain true plea-
sure at all—the truest pleasures, because they follow truth, and those that
(e) are most their own; if, indeed, what is the best for each thing is also what is
most its own?

GLAUCON: But that, of course, is what is most its own.

SOCRATES: So, when the entire soul follows the philosophic element and
does not engage in faction, the result is that each element does its own
work and is just; and, in particular, each enjoys its own pleasures, the best
(587a) pleasures and—to the degree possible—the truest.

[18]: See 372e2–373e7.

[19]: Stegnon: contrasted in the Gorgias (493a1–b3) with the “leaking jar” in which the
appetites are located.

[20]: According to the story, Stesichorus wrote a poem defaming Helen and was pun-
ished by being struck with blindness. His sight was restored when he added a verse to
the poem in which he claimed that it was a phantom of Helen and not Helen herself
who was at Troy. See Phaedrus 243a.

[21]: Envy, violence, and peevishness are all painful conditions that enhance the honor-
lover’s pleasures through contrast.

GLAUCON: Absolutely.

SOCRATES: So, when one of the other parts gains mastery, the result is that
it cannot discover its own pleasure and compels the other parts to pursue an
alien, and not a true pleasure.

GLAUCON: Yes.

SOCRATES: And wouldn’t what is most distant from philosophy and reason
be most likely to produce that result?

GLAUCON: By far.

SOCRATES: And isn’t what is most distant from reason the very thing that
is most distant from law and order?

GLAUCON: Clearly.

SOCRATES: And wasn’t it made evident that the passionate and tyrannical
(b) appetites are most distant?

GLAUCON: By far the most.

SOCRATES: And the kingly and orderly ones least distant?

GLAUCON: Yes.

SOCRATES: Then the tyrant, I suppose, will be most distant from a true
pleasure that is his own, while the king will be least distant.

GLAUCON: It is inevitable.

SOCRATES: And so, the tyrant will live most unpleasantly and the king
most pleasantly.

GLAUCON: It is absolutely inevitable.

SOCRATES: Do you know, then, how much more unpleasant the tyrant’s
life is than the king’s?

GLAUCON: Not unless you tell me.

SOCRATES: There are, it seems, three pleasures: one genuine and two ille-
(c) gitimate.The tyrant is at the extreme end of the illegitimate ones, since he
ﬂees both law and reason and lives with a bodyguard of slavish pleasures.

But it is not at all easy to say just how inferior he is—except perhaps as
follows.

GLAUCON: How?

SOCRATES: The tyrant is somehow at a third remove from the oligarch,
since the democrat was in the middle between them.[^22]
GLAUCON: Yes.

[22]: Third because the Greeks always counted the ﬁrst as well as the last member of a
series. The day after tomorrow was the third day.

SOCRATES: Won’t he also live with a phantom of pleasure, then, that, as
regards truth, is at a third remove from that other—if what we said before is
true?

GLAUCON: He will.

SOCRATES: But the oligarch, in turn, is at a third remove from the king,23
(d) if we assume king and aristocrat to be the same.

GLAUCON: Yes, third.

SOCRATES: So a tyrant is removed from true pleasure by a numerical value
of three times three.

GLAUCON: Apparently.

SOCRATES: So, on the basis of the size of this numerical value, it seems the
phantom of the tyrant’s pleasure is a plane ﬁgure.

GLAUCON: Exactly.

SOCRATES: On the basis of its square and cube, in that case, it becomes
clear how far removed it is.

GLAUCON: Clear to someone skilled in calculation, anyway!

SOCRATES: Turning it the other way around, then, if someone wants to
(e) say how far the king is removed from the tyrant in terms of true pleasure,
he will ﬁnd, if he completes the calculation, that he lives 729 times more
pleasantly, while the tyrant lives the same number of times more painfully.24
GLAUCON: That’s an extraordinary calculation of the difference between
(588a) the two men—the just one and the unjust one—in terms of their pleasure
and pain!

[23]: Because the timocrat is between them.

[24]: Socrates’ mathematics is difﬁcult to follow. He seems to have something like this
in mind: the tyrant’s pleasure is a two-dimensional image (a plane ﬁgure) of the
true, three-dimensional pleasure of the philosopher. Hence, if a one-unit square
represents the degree of closeness to true pleasure of an image nine times removed
from it, true pleasure should be represented by a nine-unit cube. It follows that the
king lives 729 times more pleasantly than the tyrant. However, in order to reach the
signiﬁcant number 729—there are 729 days and nights in a year of 364 twenty-
four–hour days and 729 months in the “great year” recognized by the Pythagorean
philosopher Philolaus—Socrates has had to make two rather fast moves. First, he
illegitimately capitalizes on the Greek manner of counting series in order to count
the oligarch twice, once as the last term in his ﬁrst series (tyrant, democrat, oli-
garch) and again as the ﬁrst term in his second series (oligarch, timocrat, king). Sec-
ond, he multiplies the number of times the tyrant is removed from the oligarch by
the number of times the oligarch is removed from the king, when he should have
added them. In fact, the tyrant is only ﬁve times removed from the king, and so lives
only 125 times less pleasantly!

SOCRATES: And yet it is a number that is both true and appropriate to
human lives—if indeed days, nights, months, and years are appropriate to
them.

GLAUCON: And of course they are appropriate.

SOCRATES: If the victory of the good and just person over the bad and
unjust one in terms of pleasure is as great as that, won’t his victory in terms
of its grace, beauty, and virtue be extraordinarily greater?

GLAUCON: Extraordinarily greater, indeed, by Zeus!

SOCRATES: All right, then. Since we have reached this point in the argu-
(b) ment, let’s return to the ﬁrst things we mentioned that led us here. I think
someone said that doing injustice proﬁts a completely unjust person who is
believed to be just.Wasn’t that the claim?25
GLAUCON: Yes, it was.

SOCRATES: Let’s discuss it with its proponent, then, since we have now
agreed on the respective effects of doing unjust and doing just things.26
GLAUCON: How?

SOCRATES: By fashioning an image of the soul in words, so that the one
who said that will know what he was saying.
(c) GLAUCON: What sort of image?

SOCRATES: One of those creatures that ancient legends say used to exist.

The Chimera, Scylla, Cerberus, and the numerous other cases where many
different kinds are said to have grown together into one.

GLAUCON: Yes, they do describe such things.

SOCRATES: Well, then, fashion a single species of complex, many-headed
beast, with a ring of tame and savage animal heads that it can grow and
change at will.

GLAUCON: That’s a task for a clever fashioner of images!27 Still, since lan-
(d) guage is easier to fashion than wax and the like, consider the fashioning
done.

SOCRATES: Now, fashion another single species—of lion—and a single
one of human being. But make the ﬁrst much the largest and the second,
second in size.

GLAUCON: That’s easier—the fashioning is done.

SOCRATES: Now, join the three in one, so that that they somehow grow
together naturally.

[25]: See 348b9–10, 360c8–361d3, 392c2–4.

[26]: See 358b4–7, 367e1–5.

[27]: See 596b12–e4.

GLAUCON: They are joined.

SOCRATES: Then fashion around the outside the image of one of them,
that of the human being, so that to anyone who cannot see what is inside,
but sees only the outer shell, it will look like a single creature, a human
(e) being.

GLAUCON: The surrounding shell has been fashioned.

SOCRATES: When someone claims, then, that it proﬁts this human being
to do injustice, but that doing what is just brings no advantage, let’s tell him
that he is saying nothing other than that it proﬁts him to feed well and
strengthen the multifarious beast, as well as the lion and everything that
pertains to the lion; to starve and weaken the human being, so that he is
(589a) dragged along wherever either of the other two leads; and not to accustom
the two to one another or make them friends, but leave them to bite and
ﬁght and devour one another.

GLAUCON: Yes, that’s exactly what someone who praises doing injustice is
saying.

SOCRATES: On the other hand, wouldn’t someone who claims that what
is just is proﬁtable be saying we should do and say what will give the inner
(b) human being the greatest mastery over the human being, to get him to take
care of the many-headed beast like a farmer, feeding and domesticating the
gentle heads and preventing the savage ones from growing; to make the
lion’s nature his ally; and to care for all in common, bringing them up in
such a way that they will be friends with each other and with himself?

GLAUCON: Yes, that’s exactly what someone who praises justice is saying.

SOCRATES: From every point of view, then, the one who praises what is
just speaks truly while the one who praises what is unjust speaks falsely. For
(c) whether we consider pleasure or good reputation or advantage, the one who
praises the just tells the truth while the one who condemns it has nothing
sound to say and condemns with no knowledge of what he is condemning.

GLAUCON: None at all, in my opinion.

SOCRATES: Then let’s persuade him gently—after all, he is not getting it
wrong intentionally—by questioning him as follows: “Bless you, but
shouldn’t we claim that this is also the basis of the conventional views about
what is ﬁne and what is shameful: what is ﬁne is what subordinates the
beastlike elements in our nature to the human one—or better, perhaps, to
(d) the divine, whereas what is shameful is what enslaves the tame element to
the savage“? Will he agree, or what?

GLAUCON: He will if he takes my advice.

SOCRATES: Is there anyone, then, in light of this argument, who proﬁts by
acquiring gold unjustly, if the result is something like this: in taking the

gold, he simultaneously enslaves the best element in himself to the most
(e) wicked? If he got the gold by enslaving his son or daughter to savage and
evil men, it would not proﬁt him, no matter how much he got for doing it.

So, if he ruthlessly enslaves the most divine element in himself to the most
godless and polluted, how could he fail to be wretched, when he accepts
golden gifts in return for a far more terrible destruction than that of Eri-
phyle, who took the necklace in return for her husband’s soul?28
(590a)
GLAUCON: A much more terrible one. I will answer for him.

SOCRATES: And don’t you think intemperance has long been condemned
for reasons of this sort; that it is because of vices like it that that terrible
creature, the large and multiform beast, is given more freedom than it
should be?

GLAUCON: Clearly.

SOCRATES: And aren’t stubbornness and peevishness condemned because
they inharmoniously increase and stretch the lionlike and snakelike29
(b) element?

GLAUCON: Certainly.

SOCRATES: And aren’t luxury and softness condemned for slackening and
loosening this same part, because that produces cowardice in it?

GLAUCON: Of course.

SOCRATES: And aren’t ﬂattery and illiberality condemned because they
subject this same spirited element to the moblike beast, allow it to be show-
ered with abuse for the sake of money and the latter’s insatiability, and
habituate it from youth to be an ape instead of a lion?
(c) GLAUCON: Yes, indeed.

SOCRATES: Why do you think someone is reproached for menial work or
handicraft? Or shall we say that it is for no other reason than because the
best element is naturally weak in him, so that it cannot rule the beasts
within him, but can only serve them and learn what ﬂatters them?

GLAUCON: Apparently.

[28]: Eriphyle was bribed by Polynices to persuade her husband, Amphiaraus, to take
part in an attack on Thebes. He was killed, and she was murdered by her son in
revenge. See Odyssey 11.326–7.

[29]: The snakelike element hasn’t been previously mentioned, although it may be
included in “all that pertains to” the lion (588e6). It symbolizes some of the meaner
components of the spirited part, such as peevishness, which it would be unnatural to
attribute to the noble lion. Snakes were thought to guard shrines and other sacred
places. Including a snakelike element in the part of the soul dominant in guardians is,
therefore, somewhat natural.

SOCRATES: In order to ensure, then, that someone like that is also ruled by
something similar to what rules the best person, we say that he should be
the slave of that best person who has the divine ruler within himself. It is
(d) not to harm the slave that we say he should be ruled, as Thrasymachus sup-
posed was true of all subjects, but because it is better for everyone to be
ruled by a divine and wise ruler—preferably one that is his own and that he
has inside himself; otherwise one imposed on him from outside, so that we
may all be as alike and as friendly as possible, because we are all captained
by the same thing.

GLAUCON: Yes, that’s right.
(e) SOCRATES: This is clearly the aim of the law as well, which is the ally of
everyone in the city. It is also our aim in ruling our children. We do not
allow them to be free until we establish a constitution in them as in a city.

That is to say, we take care of their best part with the similar one in our-
(591a) selves and equip them with a guardian and ruler similar to our own to take
our place. Only then do we set them free.

GLAUCON: Yes, that’s clearly so.

SOCRATES: How, then, will we claim, Glaucon, and on the basis of what
argument, that it proﬁts someone to do injustice, or what is intemperate, or
some shameful thing that will make him worse, even if it brings more
money or power of some other sort?

GLAUCON: There’s no way we can.

SOCRATES: Or how can we claim that it proﬁts him to be undetected in
his injustice and not pay the penalty? I mean, doesn’t the one who remains
(b) undetected become even worse, while in the one who is discovered and
punished, the bestial element is calmed and tamed and the gentle one
freed? Doesn’t his entire soul, when it returns to its best nature and acquires
temperance and justice along with wisdom, achieve a condition that is as
more honorable than that of a body when it acquires strength and beauty
along with health, as a soul is more honorable than a body?

GLAUCON: Absolutely.

SOCRATES: Won’t anyone with any sense, then, give everything he has to
(c) achieve it as long as he lives? First, won’t he honor the studies that produce
it and not honor the others?

GLAUCON: Clearly.

SOCRATES: Second, as regards the condition and nurture of his body, not
only will he not give himself over to bestial and irrational pleasure, and live
turned in that direction; but he won’t make health his aim nor give prece-
dence to the ways of becoming strong or healthy or beautiful, unless he is
also going to become temperate as a result of them. On the contrary, it is

(d) clear that he will always be tuning the harmony of his body for the sake of
the concord of his soul.

GLAUCON: He certainly will, if indeed he is going to be truly musical.

SOCRATES: Won’t he also keep order and concord in his acquisition of
money? He won’t be dazzled, will he, by what the masses regard as blessed
happiness, and—by increasing the size of his wealth without limit—acquire
an unlimited number of evils?

GLAUCON: Not in my view.

SOCRATES: On the contrary, he will keep his eye ﬁxed on the constitution
(e) within him and guard against disturbing anything there either with too
much money or with too little. Captaining himself in that way, he will
increase and spend his wealth, as far as possible by reference to it.

GLAUCON: That’s exactly what he will do.

SOCRATES: Where honors are concerned, too, he will keep his eye on the
(592a) same thing. He will willingly share in and taste those he believes will make
him better. But those that might overthrow the established condition of his
soul, he will avoid, both in private and in public.

GLAUCON: So, he won’t be willing to take part in politics, then, if that is
what he cares about.

SOCRATES: Yes, by the dog,30 in his own city, he certainly will. But he
may not be willing to do so in his fatherland, unless some divine good luck
chances to be his.

GLAUCON: I understand.You mean in the city we have just been founding
and describing; the one that exists in words, since I do not think it exists
(b) anywhere on earth.

SOCRATES: But there may perhaps be a model of it in the heavens for any-
one who wishes to look at it and to found himself on the basis of what he
sees. It makes no difference at all whether it exists anywhere or ever will.

You see, he would take part in the politics of it alone, and of no other.

GLAUCON: That’s probably right.
