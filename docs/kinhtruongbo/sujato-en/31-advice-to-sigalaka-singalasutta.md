# 31. Advice to Sigālaka
_**Siṅgālasutta**_

So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' feeding
ground. Now at that time the householder's son Sigālaka
rose early and left Rājagaha. With his clothes and hair all
wet, he raised his joined palms to revere the various quarters---[^258]
east, south, west, north, below, and above.[^259]

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
entered Rājagaha for alms. He saw Sigālaka
revering the quarters and said to him, "Householder's son, why are you
revering the quarters in this way?"

"Sir, on his deathbed my father said to me: 'My dear, please revere the
quarters.'[^260] Honoring, respecting, and venerating my father's words,
I rose early and left Rājagaha and, with my clothes and
hair all wet, raised my joined palms to revere the various
quarters---east, south, west, north, below, and above."

## 1. The Six Directions

"Householder's son, that's not how the six directions should be revered
in the training of the Noble One."[^261]

"But sir, how should the six directions be revered in the training of
the Noble One? Sir, please teach me this."

"Well then, householder's son, listen and apply your mind well, I will
speak."

"Yes, sir," replied Sigālaka. The Buddha said this:

"Householder's son, a noble disciple gives up four corrupt deeds,
doesn't do bad deeds on four grounds, and avoids six drains on wealth.
When they've left these fourteen bad things behind they have the six
directions covered.[^262] They're practicing to win in both worlds, and
they succeed in this world and the next. When their body breaks up,
after death, they're reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.

## 2. Four Corrupt Deeds

What four corrupt deeds have they given up?[^263] Killing living
creatures, stealing, sexual misconduct, and lying: these are corrupt
deeds. These are the four corrupt deeds they've given up."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "Killing, stealing,\
> telling lies,\
> and committing adultery:\
> astute people don't praise these things."

## 3. Four Grounds

"On what four grounds do they not do bad deeds?[^264] One does bad deeds
prejudiced by favoritism, hostility, stupidity, and cowardice. When a
noble disciple is not prejudiced by favoritism, hostility, stupidity,
and cowardice, they don't do bad deeds on these four grounds."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "If you act against the teaching\
> out of favoritism, hostility, cowardice, or stupidity,\
> your fame shrinks,\
> like the moon in the waning fortnight.
>
> If you don't act against the teaching\
> out of favoritism, hostility, cowardice, and stupidity,\
> your fame swells,\
> like the moon in the waxing fortnight."

## 4. Six Drains on Wealth

"What six drains on wealth do they avoid?[^265] Habitually engaging in
the following things is a drain on wealth: consuming beer, wine, and
liquor intoxicants; roaming the streets at night; frequenting festivals;
gambling; bad friends; laziness.[^266]

## 5. Six Drawbacks of Drinking

There are these six drawbacks of habitually consuming beer, wine, and
liquor that cause intoxication.[^267] Immediate loss of wealth,
promotion of quarrels, susceptibility to illness, disrepute, indecent
exposure; and weakened wisdom is the sixth thing. These are the six
drawbacks of habitually consuming beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants.

## 6. Six Drawbacks of Roaming the Streets at Night

There are these six drawbacks of roaming the streets at night. Yourself,
your partners and children, and your property are all left unguarded.
You're suspected of bad deeds. Untrue rumors spread about you. You're at
the forefront of many things that entail suffering. These are the six
drawbacks of roaming the streets at night.

## 7. Six Drawbacks of Festivals

There are these six drawbacks of frequenting festivals. You're always
thinking: 'Where's the dancing? Where's the singing? Where's the music?
Where are the stories? Where's the applause? Where are the kettledrums?'
These are the six drawbacks of frequenting festivals.

## 8. Six Drawbacks of Gambling

There are these six drawbacks of habitually gambling. Victory breeds
enmity. The loser mourns their money. There is immediate loss of wealth.
A gambler's word carries no weight in public assembly. Friends and
colleagues treat them with contempt. And no-one wants to marry a
gambler, for they think: 'This individual is a gambler---they're not
able to support a partner.' These are the six drawbacks of habitually
gambling.

## 9. Six Drawbacks of Bad Friends

There are these six drawbacks of bad friends. You become friends and
companions with those who are addicts, carousers, drunkards, frauds,
swindlers, and thugs. These are the six drawbacks of bad friends.

## 10. Six Drawbacks of Laziness

There are these six drawbacks of habitual laziness. You don't get your
work done because you think: 'It's too cold! It's too hot. It's too
late! It's too early! I'm too hungry! I'm too full!' By dwelling on so
many excuses for not working, you don't make any more money, and the
money you already have runs out. These are the six drawbacks of habitual
laziness."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "Some are just drinking buddies,\
> some call you their dear, dear friend,\
> but a true friend is one\
> who stands by you in need.
>
> Sleeping late, adultery,\
> making enemies, harmfulness,\
> bad friends, and avarice:\
> these six grounds ruin a person.
>
> With bad friends, bad companions,\
> bad behavior and alms-resort,\
> a man falls to ruin\
> in both this world and the next.
>
> Dice, women, toddy, song and dance;[^268]\
> sleeping by day and roaming at night;\
> bad friends, and avarice:\
> these six grounds ruin a person.
>
> They play dice and drink beer,\
> and consort with women loved by others.\
> Associating with the worse, not the better,\
> they diminish like the waning moon.
>
> One who is broke and destitute due to toddy,[^269]\
> thirsty, drinking in the bar,\
> drowning in debt,\
> will quickly lose their way.[^270]
>
> When you're in the habit of sleeping late,\
> seeing night as time to rise,\
> and always getting drunk,\
> you can't keep up the household life.
>
> 'Too cold, too hot,\
> too late,' they say.\
> When the young neglect their work like this,\
> riches pass them by.[^271]
>
> But one who considers heat and cold\
> as no more than blades of grass---\
> he does his duties as a man,\
> and happiness never fails."

## 11. Fake Friends

"Householder's son, you should recognize these four enemies disguised as
friends: the taker, the talker, the flatterer, the spender.

You can recognize a fake friend who's all take on four grounds.

> Your possessions end up theirs.\
> Giving little, they expect a lot.\
> They do their duty out of fear.\
> They associate for their own advantage.

You can recognize a fake friend who's all take on these four grounds.

You can recognize a fake friend who's all talk on four grounds. They're
hospitable in the past. They're hospitable in the future. They're full
of meaningless pleasantries. When something needs doing in the present
they point to their own misfortune. You can recognize a fake friend
who's all talk on these four grounds.

You can recognize a fake friend who's a flatterer on four grounds. They
support you equally in doing bad and doing good. They praise you to your
face, and put you down behind your back. You can recognize a fake friend
who's a flatterer on these four grounds.

You can recognize a fake friend who's a spender on four grounds. They
accompany you when drinking, roaming the streets at night, frequenting
festivals, and gambling. You can recognize a fake friend who's a spender
on these four grounds."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "One friend is all take,\
> another all talk;\
> one's just a flatterer,\
> and one's a friend who spends.
>
> An astute person understands\
> these four enemies for what they are\
> and keeps them at a distance,\
> as they'd shun a risky road."

## 12. Good-Hearted Friends

"Householder's son, you should recognize these four good-hearted
friends: the helper, the friend in good times and bad, the counselor,
and the one who's sympathetic.

You can recognize a good-hearted friend who's a helper on four grounds.
They guard you when you're negligent. They guard your property when
you're negligent. They keep you safe in times of danger. When something
needs doing, they provide you with twice the money you need. You can
recognize a good-hearted friend who's a helper on these four grounds.

You can recognize a good-hearted friend who's the same in good times and
bad on four grounds. They tell you secrets. They keep your secrets. They
don't abandon you in times of trouble. They'd even give their life for
your welfare. You can recognize a good-hearted friend who's the same in
good times and bad on these four grounds.

You can recognize a good-hearted friend who's a counselor on four
grounds. They keep you from doing bad. They support you in doing good.
They teach you what you do not know. They explain the path to heaven.
You can recognize a good-hearted friend who's a counselor on these four
grounds.

You can recognize a good-hearted friend who's sympathetic on four
grounds. They don't delight in your misfortune. They delight in your
good fortune. They keep others from criticizing you. They encourage
praise of you. You can recognize a good-hearted friend who's sympathetic
on these four grounds."

The Buddha spoke this matter. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "A friend who's a helper,\
> one the same in both pleasure and pain,\
> a friend of good counsel,\
> and one of sympathy;
>
> an astute person understands\
> these four friends for what they are\
> and carefully looks after them,\
> like a mother the child at her breast.\
> The astute and virtuous\
> shine like a burning flame.
>
> They pick up riches as bees\
> roaming round pick up pollen.\
> And their riches proceed to grow,\
> like a termite mound piling up.
>
> In gathering wealth like this,\
> a householder does enough for their family.\
> And they'd hold on to friends\
> by dividing their wealth in four.
>
> One portion is to enjoy.\
> Two parts invest in work.\
> And the fourth should be kept\
> for times of trouble."

## 13. Covering the Six Directions

"And how, householder's son, does a noble disciple cover the six
directions?[^272] These six directions should be recognized: parents as
the east, tutors as the south, partner and children as the west, friends
and colleagues as the north, bondservants and workers as beneath, and
ascetics and brahmins as above.[^273]

A child should serve their parents as the eastern quarter in five ways,
thinking: 'I will support those who supported me. I'll do my duty for
them. I'll maintain the family lineage. I'll take care of the
inheritance. When they have passed away, I'll make an offering on their
behalf.' Parents served by the children in these five ways show sympathy
to them in five ways. They keep them from doing bad. They support them
in doing good. They train them in a profession. They connect them with a
suitable partner. They transfer the inheritance in due time. Parents
served by their children in these five ways show sympathy to them in
these five ways. And that's how the eastern quarter is covered, kept
safe and free of peril.

A pupil should serve their tutor as the southern quarter in five ways:
by rising for them, by serving them, by listening well, by looking after
them, and by carefully learning their profession. Tutors served by their
pupils in these five ways show sympathy to them in five ways. They make
sure they're well educated and well drilled in memorization. They
clearly explain all the knowledge of the profession. They introduce them
to their friends and colleagues. They provide protection in every
region.[^274] Tutors served by their pupils in these five ways show
sympathy to them in these five ways. And that's how the southern quarter
is covered, kept safe and free of peril.

A husband should serve his wife as the western quarter in five ways: by
treating her with honor, by not looking down on her, by not being
unfaithful, by relinquishing authority to her, and by presenting her
with adornments.[^275] A wife served by her husband in these five ways
shows sympathy to him in five ways. She's well-organized in her work.
She manages the domestic help. She's not unfaithful. She preserves his
earnings. She's deft and tireless in all her duties. A wife served by
her husband in these five ways shows sympathy to him in these five ways.
And that's how the western quarter is covered, kept safe and free of
peril.

A gentleman should serve his friends and colleagues as the northern
quarter in five ways: giving, kindly words, taking care, equality, and
not using tricky words. Friends and colleagues served by a gentleman in
these five ways show sympathy to him in five ways. They guard him when
they're negligent. They guard his property when they're negligent. They
keep him safe in times of danger. They don't abandon him in times of
trouble. They honor his descendants. Friends and colleagues served by a
gentleman in these five ways show sympathy to him in these five ways.
And that's how the northern quarter is covered, kept safe and free of
peril.

A master should serve their bondservants and workers as the lower
quarter in five ways: by organizing work according to ability, by paying
food and wages, by nursing them when sick, by sharing special treats,
and by giving time off work. Bondservants and workers served by a master
in these five ways show sympathy to him in five ways. They get up first,
and go to bed last. They don't steal. They do their work well. And they
promote a good reputation. Bondservants and workers served by a master
in these five ways show sympathy to him in these five ways. And that's
how the lower quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril.

A gentleman should serve ascetics and brahmins as the upper quarter in
five ways: by loving deeds of body, speech, and mind, by not turning
them away at the gate, and by providing them with material needs.
Ascetics and brahmins served by a gentleman in these five ways show
sympathy to him in six ways. They keep him from doing bad. They support
him in doing good. They think of him with kindly thoughts. They teach
him what he does not know. They clarify what he's already learned. They
explain the path to heaven. Ascetics and brahmins served by a gentleman
in these five ways show sympathy to him in these six ways. And that's
how the upper quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril."

The Buddha spoke this matter. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "Parents are the east,\
> tutors the south,\
> wives and child the west,\
> friends and colleagues the north,
>
> servants and workers below,\
> and ascetics and brahmins above.\
> By honoring these quarters\
> a householder does enough for their family.
>
> The astute and the virtuous,\
> the gentle and the articulate,\
> the humble and the kind:\
> they're the kind who win glory.
>
> The diligent, not lazy,\
> those not disturbed by troubles,\
> those consistent in conduct, the intelligent:\
> they're the kind who win glory.
>
> The inclusive, the makers of friends,\
> the bountiful, those rid of stinginess,\
> those who lead, train, and persuade:\
> they're the kind who win glory.
>
> Giving and kindly words,\
> taking care here,\
> and treating equally in worldly conditions,\
> as befits them in each case;\
> these ways of being inclusive in the world\
> are like a moving chariot's linchpin.
>
> If there were no such ways of being inclusive,\
> neither mother nor father\
> would be respected and honored\
> for what they've done for their children.
>
> But since these ways of being inclusive do exist,\
> the astute do regard them well,\
> so they achieve greatness\
> and are praised."

When this was said, Sigālaka the householder's son said to
the Buddha, "Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the
overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the
lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see
what's there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go
for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant
Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as
a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."
