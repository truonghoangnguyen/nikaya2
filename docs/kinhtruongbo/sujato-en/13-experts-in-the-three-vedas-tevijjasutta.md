# DN 13 Experts in the Three Vedas *Tevijjasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was wandering in
the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of
five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan
brahmins named Manasākaṭa.[^638] He stayed in a mango grove
on a bank of the river Aciravatī to the north of
Manasākaṭa.[^639]

Now at that time several very well-known well-to-do brahmins were
residing in Manasākaṭa. They included the brahmins
Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti,
Jānussoṇi, Todeyya, and others.

Then as the students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja
were going for a walk they began a discussion regarding what is the path
and what is not the path.[^640]

Vāseṭṭha said this: "This is the only straight path, the
direct route that delivers one who practices it to the company of
Divinity; namely, that explained by the brahmin
Pokkharasāti."[^641]

Bhāradvāja said this: "This is the only straight path, the
direct route that delivers one who practices it to the company of
Divinity; namely, that explained by the brahmin
Tārukkha."[^642]

But neither was able to persuade the other. So Vāseṭṭha
said to Bhāradvāja, "Bhāradvāja, the ascetic
Gotama---a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family---is staying in a
mango grove on a bank of the river Aciravatī to the north
of Manasākaṭa. He has this good reputation: 'That Blessed
One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and
conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to
train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.' Come, let's go to
see him and ask him about this matter. As he answers, so we'll remember
it."

"Yes, sir," replied Bhāradvāja.

## 1. What is the Path and What is Not the Path

So they went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. When the
greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side
and Vāseṭṭha told him of their conversation, adding: "In
this matter we have a dispute, a disagreement, a difference of opinion."

"So, Vāseṭṭha, it seems that you say that the straight path
is that explained by Pokkharasāti, while
Bhāradvāja says that the straight path is that explained by
Tārukkha. But what exactly is your disagreement about?"

"About what is the path and what is not the path, Mister Gotama. Even
though brahmins describe different paths---the Adhvaryu brahmins, the
Taittirīya brahmins, the Chāndogya brahmins,
the Cāndrāyaṇa brahmins, and the Bahvṛca
brahmins---all of them still lead someone who practices them to the
company of Divinity.[^643]

It's like a village or town that has many different roads nearby, yet
all of them meet at that village.[^644] In the same way, even though
brahmins describe different paths---the Adhvaryu brahmins, the
Taittirīya brahmins, the Chāndogya brahmins,
the Cāndrāyaṇa brahmins, and the Bahvṛca
brahmins---all of them still lead someone who practices them to the
company of Divinity."

## 2. Questioning Vāseṭṭha

"Do you say, 'they lead someone', Vāseṭṭha?"

"I do, Mister Gotama."

"Do you say, 'they lead someone', Vāseṭṭha?"

"I do, Mister Gotama."

"Do you say, 'they lead someone', Vāseṭṭha?"

"I do, Mister Gotama."

"Well, of the brahmins who are proficient in the three Vedas,
Vāseṭṭha, is there even a single one who has seen the
Divinity with their own eyes?"

"No, Mister Gotama."

"Well, has even a single one of their tutors seen the Divinity with
their own eyes?"

"No, Mister Gotama."

"Well, has even a single one of their tutors' tutors seen the Divinity
with their own eyes?"

"No, Mister Gotama."

"Well, has anyone back to the seventh generation of tutors seen the
Divinity with their own eyes?"

"No, Mister Gotama."

"Well, what of the ancient seers of the brahmins proficient in the three
Vedas, namely Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka,
Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamadaggi,
Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha,
Kassapa, and Bhagu? They were the authors and propagators of the hymns.
Their hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times; and
these days, brahmins continue to sing and chant it, chanting what was
chanted and teaching what was taught.[^645] Did they say: 'We know and
see where the Divinity is or what way he lies'?"[^646]

"No, Mister Gotama."

"So it seems that none of those brahmins have seen the Divinity with
their own eyes, and not even the ancient seers claimed to know where he
is. Yet the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas say: 'We teach the
path to the company of that which we neither know nor see. This is the
only straight path, the direct route that delivers one who practices it
to the company of Divinity.'

What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? This being so, doesn't their
statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis?"[^647]

"Clearly that's the case, Mister Gotama."

"Good, Vāseṭṭha. For it is impossible that they should
teach the path to that which they neither know nor see.

<!--pg-->
Suppose there was a queue of blind men, each holding the one in front:
the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last
one does not see.[^648] In the same way, it seems to me that the
brahmins' statement turns out to be comparable to a queue of blind men:
the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last
one does not see. Their statement turns out to be a joke---mere words,
vacuous and hollow.

What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Do the brahmins proficient in
the three Vedas see the sun and moon just as other folk do? And do they
pray to them and exalt them, following their course from where they rise
to where they set with joined palms held in worship?"[^649]

"Yes, Mister Gotama."

"What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Though this is so, are the
brahmins proficient in the three Vedas able to teach the path to the
company of the sun and moon, saying: 'This is the only straight path,
the direct route that delivers one who practices it to the company of
the sun and moon'?"[^650]

"No, Mister Gotama."

"So it seems that even though the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas
see the sun and moon, they are not able to teach the path to the company
of the sun and moon.

But it seems that even though they have not seen the Divinity with their
own eyes, they still claim to teach the path to the company of that
which they neither know nor see.

What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? This being so, doesn't their
statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis?"

"Clearly that's the case, Mister Gotama."

"Good, Vāseṭṭha. For it is impossible that they should
teach the path to that which they neither know nor see.

### 2.1. The Simile of the Finest Lady in the Land

Suppose a man were to say, 'Whoever the finest lady in the land is, it
is her that I want, her that I desire!'

They'd say to him, 'Mister, that finest lady in the land who you
desire---do you know whether she's an aristocrat, a brahmin, a peasant,
or a menial?' Asked this, he'd say, 'No.'

They'd say to him, 'Mister, that finest lady in the land who you
desire---do you know her name or clan? Whether she's tall or short or
medium? Whether her skin is black, brown, or tawny? What village, town,
or city she comes from?'

Asked this, he'd say, 'No.'

They'd say to him, 'Mister, do you desire someone who you've never even
known or seen?'

Asked this, he'd say, 'Yes.'

What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? This being so, doesn't that
man's statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis?"

"Clearly that's the case, Mister Gotama."

"In the same way, doesn't the statement of those brahmins turn out to
have no demonstrable basis?"

"Clearly that's the case, Mister Gotama."

"Good, Vāseṭṭha. For it is impossible that they should
teach the path to that which they neither know nor see.
<!--pg-->
### 2.2. The Simile of the Ladder

Suppose a man was to build a ladder at the crossroads for climbing up to
a stilt longhouse.

They'd say to him, 'Mister, that stilt longhouse that you're building a
ladder for---do you know whether it's to the north, south, east, or
west? Or whether it's tall or short or medium?'

Asked this, he'd say, 'No.'

They'd say to him, 'Mister, are you building a ladder for a longhouse
that you've never even known or seen?'

Asked this, he'd say, 'Yes.'

What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? This being so, doesn't that
man's statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis?"

"Clearly that's the case, Mister Gotama."

"In the same way, doesn't the statement of those brahmins turn out to
have no demonstrable basis?"

"Clearly that's the case, Mister Gotama."

"Good, Vāseṭṭha. For it is impossible that they should
teach the path to that which they neither know nor see.

<!--pg-->
### 2.3. The Simile of the River Aciravatī

Suppose the river Aciravatī was full to the brim so a crow
could drink from it. Then along comes a person who wants to cross over
to the far shore. Standing on the near shore, they'd call out to the far
shore, 'Come here, far shore! Come here, far shore!'

What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Would the far shore of the
Aciravatī river come over to the near shore because of that
man's call, request, desire, or expectation?"

"No, Mister Gotama."

"In the same way, Vāseṭṭha, the brahmins proficient in the
three Vedas proceed having given up those things that make one a true
brahmin, and having undertaken those things that make one not a true
brahmin. Yet they say:[^651] 'We call upon Indra! We call upon Soma! We
call upon Varuṇa! We call upon Īsāna! We call
upon the Progenitor! We call upon the Divinity! We call upon Mahinda! We
call upon Yama!'[^652]

So long as they proceed in this way it's impossible that they will, when
the body breaks up, after death, be reborn in the company of Divinity.

Suppose the river Aciravatī was full to the brim so a crow
could drink from it. Then along comes a person who wants to cross over
to the far shore. But while still on the near shore, their arms are tied
tightly behind their back with a strong chain.

What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Could that person cross over
to the far shore?"

"No, Mister Gotama."

"In the same way, the five kinds of sensual stimulation are called
'chains' and 'fetters' in the training of the Noble One. What five?
Sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable,
pleasant, sensual, and arousing. Sounds known by the ear ... Smells
known by the nose ... Tastes known by the tongue ... Touches known by
the body, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual,
and arousing.

<!--pg-->
These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation that are called 'chains'
and 'fetters' in the training of the Noble One. The brahmins proficient
in the three Vedas enjoy these five kinds of sensual stimulation tied,
infatuated, attached, blind to the drawbacks, and not understanding the
escape. So long as they enjoy them it's impossible that they will, when
the body breaks up, after death, be reborn in the company of Divinity.

Suppose the river Aciravatī was full to the brim so a crow
could drink from it. Then along comes a person who wants to cross over
to the far shore. But they'd lie down wrapped in cloth from head to
foot.

What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Could that person cross over
to the far shore?"

"No, Mister Gotama."

<!--pg-->
"In the same way, the five hindrances are called 'obstacles' and
'hindrances' and 'encasings' and 'shrouds' in the training of the Noble
One. What five? The hindrances of sensual desire, ill will, dullness and
drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. These five hindrances
are called 'obstacles' and 'hindrances' and 'encasings' and 'shrouds' in
the training of the Noble One.

The brahmins proficient in the three Vedas are obstructed, hindered,
encased, and shrouded by these five hindrances. So long as they are so
obstructed it's impossible that they will, when the body breaks up,
after death, be reborn in the company of Divinity.

## 3. Converging

What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Have you heard that the
brahmins who are elderly and senior, the tutors of tutors, say whether
the Divinity is encumbered with possessions or not?"

"That he is not, Mister Gotama."

"Is his heart full of enmity or not?"

"It is not."

"Is his heart full of ill will or not?"

"It is not."

"Is his heart corrupted or not?"

"It is not."

"Does he wield power or not?"

"He does."

"What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Are the brahmins proficient
in the three Vedas encumbered with possessions or not?"

"They are."

"Are their hearts full of enmity or not?"

"They are."

"Are their hearts full of ill will or not?"

"They are."

"Are their hearts corrupted or not?"

"They are."

"Do they wield power or not?"

"They do not."

"So it seems that the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas are
encumbered with possessions, but the Divinity is not. But would brahmins
who are encumbered with possessions come together and converge with the
Divinity, who isn't encumbered with possessions?"

"No, Mister Gotama."

"Good, Vāseṭṭha! It's impossible that the brahmins who are
encumbered with possessions will, when the body breaks up, after death,
be reborn in the company of Divinity, who isn't encumbered with
possessions.

And it seems that the brahmins have enmity, ill will, corruption, and do
not wield power, while the Divinity is the opposite in all these things.
But would brahmins who are opposite to the Divinity in all things come
together and converge with him?"

"No, Mister Gotama."

"Good, Vāseṭṭha! It's impossible that such brahmins will,
when the body breaks up, after death, be reborn in the company of
Divinity.

But here the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas sink down where they
have sat, only to drift apart, while imagining they're crossing over to
drier ground.[^653] That's why the three Vedas of the brahmins are
called a 'salted land' and a 'barren land' and a 'disaster'."

When he said this, Vāseṭṭha said to the Buddha, "I have
heard, Mister Gotama, that you know the path to company with Divinity."

"What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Is the village of
Manasākaṭa nearby?"

"Yes it is."

"What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Suppose a person was born and
raised in Manasākaṭa. And as soon as they left the town
some people asked them for the road to Manasākaṭa. Would
they be slow or hesitant to answer?"

"No, Mister Gotama. Why is that? Because they were born and raised in
Manasākaṭa. They're well acquainted with all the roads to
the village."

"Still, it's possible they might be slow or hesitant to answer. But the
Realized One is never slow or hesitant when questioned about the realm
of divinity or the practice that leads to the realm of divinity. I
understand the Divinity, the realm of divinity, and the practice that
leads to the realm of divinity, practicing in accordance with which one
is reborn in the realm of divinity."

When he said this, Vāseṭṭha said to the Buddha, "I have
heard, Mister Gotama, that you teach the path to company with
Divinity.[^654] Please teach us that path and elevate this generation of
brahmins."

"Well then, Vāseṭṭha, listen and apply your mind well, I
will speak."

"Yes, sir," replied Vāseṭṭha.

## 4. Teaching the Path to the Divinity

The Buddha said this:

"It's when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully
awakened Buddha ... That's how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics.
... Seeing that the hindrances have been given up in them, joy springs
up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture,
the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss.
And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed.

They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to
the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above,
below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love
to the whole world---abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and
ill will.[^655]

Suppose there was a powerful horn blower. They'd easily make themselves
heard in the four quarters. In the same way, when the heart's release by
love has been developed like this, any limited deeds they've done don't
remain or persist there.[^656] This is a path to company with Divinity.

Furthermore, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of compassion
...[^657]

They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing ...[^658]

They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and
to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way
above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full
of equanimity to the whole world---abundant, expansive, limitless, free
of enmity and ill will.[^659]

Suppose there was a powerful horn blower. They'd easily make themselves
heard in the four quarters. In the same way, when the heart's release by
equanimity has been developed and cultivated like this, any limited
deeds they've done don't remain or persist there. This too is a path to
company with Divinity.[^660]

What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? When a mendicant meditates
like this, are they encumbered with possessions or not?"

"They are not."

"Is their heart full of enmity or not?"

"It is not."

"Is their heart full of ill will or not?"

"It is not."

"Is their heart corrupted or not?"

"It is not."

"Do they wield power or not?"

"They do."

"So it seems that that mendicant is not encumbered with possessions, and
neither is the Divinity. Would a mendicant who is not encumbered with
possessions come together and converge with the Divinity, who isn't
encumbered with possessions?"

"Yes, Mister Gotama."

"Good, Vāseṭṭha! It's quite possible that a mendicant who
is not encumbered with possessions will, when the body breaks up, after
death, be reborn in the company of Divinity, who isn't encumbered with
possessions.

And it seems that that mendicant has no enmity, ill will, corruption,
and does wield power, while the Divinity is the same in all these
things. Would a mendicant who is the same as the Divinity in all things
come together and converge with him?"

"Yes, Mister Gotama."

"Good, Vāseṭṭha! It's quite possible that that mendicant
will, when the body breaks up, after death, be reborn in the company of
Divinity."[^661]

When he had spoken, Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja
said to him, "Excellent, Mister Gotama! Excellent! As if he were
righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the
path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear
eyes can see what's there, Mister Gotama has made the teaching clear in
many ways. We go for refuge to Mister Gotama, to the teaching, and to
the mendicant Saṅgha.[^662] From this day forth, may Mister
Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life."
