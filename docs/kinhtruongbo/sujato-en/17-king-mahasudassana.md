# DN 17 King Mahāsudassana

_**Mahāsudassanasutta**_

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying
between a pair of sal trees in the sal forest of the Mallas at
Upavattana near Kusinārā at the time of his full
extinguishment.[^541]

Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to him, "Sir, please don't be fully extinguished in this
little hamlet, this jungle hamlet, this branch hamlet. There are other
great cities such as Campā, Rājagaha,
Sāvatthī, Sāketa, Kosambī, and
Varanasi. Let the Buddha be fully extinguished there. There are many
well-to-do aristocrats, brahmins, and householders there who are devoted
to the Buddha. They will perform the rites of venerating the Realized
One's corpse."

"Don't say that, Ānanda! Don't say that this is a little hamlet, a
jungle hamlet, a branch hamlet.

## 1. The Capital City of Kusāvatī

Once upon a time there was a king named Mahāsudassana whose
dominion extended to all four sides, and who achieved stability in the
country. His capital was this Kusinārā, which at the time
was named Kusāvatī. It stretched for twelve leagues from
east to west, and seven leagues from north to south. The royal capital
of Kusāvatī was successful, prosperous, populous, full of
people, with plenty of food. It was just like Āḷakamandā,
the royal capital of the gods, which is successful, prosperous,
populous, full of spirits, with plenty of food.

Kusāvatī was never free of ten sounds by day or night,
namely: the sound of elephants, horses, chariots, drums, clay drums,
arched harps, singing, horns, gongs, and handbells; and the cry, 'Eat,
drink, be merry!' as the tenth.

Kusāvatī was encircled by seven ramparts:[^542] one made of
gold, one made of silver, one made of beryl, one made of crystal, one
made of ruby, one made of emerald, and one made of all precious things.

It had four gates, made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. At each
gate there were seven pillars, three fathoms deep and four fathoms
high,[^543] made of gold, silver, beryl, crystal, ruby, emerald, and all
precious things.

It was surrounded by seven rows of palm trees, made of gold, silver,
beryl, crystal, ruby, emerald, and all precious things. The golden palms
had trunks of gold, and leaves and fruits of silver. The silver palms
had trunks of silver, and leaves and fruits of gold. The beryl palms had
trunks of beryl, and leaves and fruits of crystal. The crystal palms had
trunks of crystal, and leaves and fruits of beryl. The ruby palms had
trunks of ruby, and leaves and fruits of emerald. The emerald palms had
trunks of emerald, and leaves and fruits of ruby. The palms of all
precious things had trunks of all precious things, and leaves and fruits
of all precious things. When those rows of palm trees were blown by the
wind they sounded graceful, tantalizing, sensuous, lovely, and
intoxicating, like a quintet made up of skilled musicians who had
practiced well and kept excellent rhythm. And any addicts, carousers, or
drunkards in Kusāvatī at that time were entertained by that
sound.[^544]

## 2. The Seven Treasures

### 2.1. The Wheel-Treasure

King Mahāsudassana possessed seven treasures and four
blessings. What seven?

On a fifteenth day sabbath, King Mahāsudassana had bathed
his head and gone upstairs in the royal longhouse to observe the
sabbath.[^545] And the heavenly wheel-treasure appeared to him, with a
thousand spokes, with rim and hub, complete in every detail.[^546]
Seeing this, the king thought, 'I have heard that when the heavenly
wheel-treasure appears to a king in this way, he becomes a wheel-turning
monarch. Am I then a wheel-turning monarch?'

Then King Mahāsudassana, rising from his seat and arranging
his robe over one shoulder, took a ceremonial vase in his left hand and
besprinkled the wheel-treasure with his right hand, saying:[^547] 'Roll
forth, O wheel-treasure! Triumph, O wheel-treasure!'

Then the wheel-treasure rolled towards the east. And the king followed
it together with his army of four divisions. In whatever place the
wheel-treasure stood still, there the king came to stay together with
his army.[^548]

And any opposing rulers of the eastern quarter came to him and said,
'Come, great king! Welcome, great king! We are yours, great king,
instruct us.'

The king said, 'Do not kill living creatures. Do not steal. Do not
commit sexual misconduct. Do not lie. Do not drink liquor. Maintain the
current level of taxation.'[^549] And so the opposing rulers of the
eastern quarter became his vassals.

Then the wheel-treasure, having plunged into the eastern ocean and
emerged again, rolled towards the south. ...[^550]

Having plunged into the southern ocean and emerged again, it rolled
towards the west. ...

Having plunged into the western ocean and emerged again, it rolled
towards the north, followed by the king together with his army of four
divisions. In whatever place the wheel-treasure stood still, there the
king came to stay together with his army.

And any opposing rulers of the northern quarter came to him and said,
'Come, great king! Welcome, great king! We are yours, great king,
instruct us.'

The king said, 'Do not kill living creatures. Do not steal. Do not
commit sexual misconduct. Do not lie. Do not drink liquor. Maintain the
current level of taxation.' And so the opposing rulers of the northern
quarter became his vassals.[^551]

And then the wheel-treasure, having triumphed over this land surrounded
by ocean, returned to the royal capital. There it stood still by the
gate to the royal compound at the High Court as if fixed to an axle,
illuminating the royal compound.[^552] Such is the wheel-treasure that
appeared to King Mahāsudassana.

### 2.2. The Elephant-Treasure

Next, the elephant-treasure appeared to King Mahāsudassana.
It was an all-white sky-walker with psychic power, touching the ground
in seven places, a king of elephants named Sabbath.[^553] Seeing him,
the king was impressed, 'This would truly be a fine elephant vehicle, if
he would submit to taming.' Then the elephant-treasure submitted to
taming, as if he was a fine thoroughbred elephant that had been tamed
for a long time.

Once it so happened that King Mahāsudassana, testing that
same elephant-treasure, mounted him in the morning and traversed the
land surrounded by ocean before returning to the royal capital in time
for breakfast. Such is the elephant-treasure that appeared to King
Mahāsudassana.

### 2.3. The Horse-Treasure

Next, the horse-treasure appeared to King Mahāsudassana. It
was an all-white sky-walker with psychic power, with head of black and
mane like woven reeds, a royal steed named Thundercloud.[^554] Seeing
him, the king was impressed, 'This would truly be a fine horse vehicle,
if he would submit to taming.' Then the horse-treasure submitted to
taming, as if he was a fine thoroughbred horse that had been tamed for a
long time.

Once it so happened that King Mahāsudassana, testing that
same horse-treasure, mounted him in the morning and traversed the land
surrounded by ocean before returning to the royal capital in time for
breakfast. Such is the horse-treasure that appeared to King
Mahāsudassana.

### 2.4. The Jewel-Treasure

Next, the jewel-treasure appeared to King Mahāsudassana. It
was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful, eight-faceted,
well-worked, transparent, clear, and unclouded, endowed with all good
qualities. And the radiance of that jewel spread all-round for a league.

Once it so happened that King Mahāsudassana, testing that
same jewel-treasure, mobilized his army of four divisions and, with the
jewel hoisted on his banner, set out in the dark of the night. Then the
villagers around them set off to work, thinking that it was day. Such is
the jewel-treasure that appeared to King Mahāsudassana.

### 2.5. The Woman-Treasure

Next, the woman-treasure appeared to King Mahāsudassana.
She was attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. She was
neither too tall nor too short; neither too thin nor too fat; neither
too dark nor too light. She outdid human beauty without reaching
heavenly beauty. And her touch was like a tuft of cotton-wool or kapok.
When it was cool her limbs were warm, and when it was warm her limbs
were cool. The fragrance of sandal floated from her body, and lotus from
her mouth. She got up before the king and went to bed after him, and was
obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely. The woman-treasure did
not betray the wheel-turning monarch even in thought, still less in
deed. Such is the woman-treasure that appeared to King
Mahāsudassana.

### 2.6. The Householder-Treasure

Next, the householder-treasure appeared to King
Mahāsudassana. The power of clairvoyance manifested in him
as a result of past deeds, by which he sees hidden treasure, both owned
and ownerless.

He approached the king and said, 'Relax, sire. I will take care of the
treasury.'

Once it so happened that the wheel-turning monarch, testing that same
householder-treasure, boarded a boat and sailed to the middle of the
Ganges river. Then he said to the householder-treasure, 'Householder, I
need gold, both coined and uncoined.'

'Well then, great king, draw the boat up to one shore.'

'It's right here, householder, that I need gold, both coined and
uncoined.'

Then that householder-treasure, immersing both hands in the water,
pulled up a pot full of gold, both coined and uncoined, and said to the
king, 'Is this sufficient, great king? Has enough been done, great king,
enough offered?'

The king said, 'That is sufficient, householder. Enough has been done,
enough offered.'

Such is the householder-treasure that appeared to King
Mahāsudassana.

### 2.7. The Commander-Treasure

Next, the commander-treasure appeared to King
Mahāsudassana. He was astute, competent, intelligent, and
capable of getting the king to appoint who should be appointed, dismiss
who should be dismissed, and retain who should be retained.[^555]

He approached the king and said, 'Relax, sire. I shall issue
instructions.'

Such is the commander-treasure that appeared to King
Mahāsudassana.

These are the seven treasures possessed by King
Mahāsudassana.

## 3. The Four Blessings

King Mahāsudassana possessed four blessings. And what are
the four blessings?

He was attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty, more so
than other people. This is the first blessing.

Furthermore, he was long-lived, more so than other people. This is the
second blessing.

Furthermore, he was rarely ill or unwell, and his stomach digested well,
being neither too hot nor too cold, more so than other people. This is
the third blessing.

Furthermore, he was as dear and beloved to the brahmins and householders
as a father is to his children. And the brahmins and householders were
as dear to the king as children are to their father.

Once it so happened that King Mahāsudassana went with his
army of four divisions to visit a park. Then the brahmins and
householders went up to him and said, 'Slow down, Your Majesty, so we
may see you longer!' And the king addressed his charioteer, 'Drive
slowly, charioteer, so I can see the brahmins and householders longer!'
This is the fourth blessing.

These are the four blessings possessed by King
Mahāsudassana.

## 4. Lotus Ponds in the Palace of Principle

Then King Mahāsudassana thought, 'Why don't I have lotus
ponds built between the palms, at intervals of a hundred bow lengths?'

So that's what he did. The lotus ponds were lined with tiles of four
colors, made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal.

And four flights of stairs of four colors descended into each lotus
pond, made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. The golden stairs had
posts of gold, and banisters and finials of silver. The silver stairs
had posts of silver, and banisters and finials of gold. The beryl stairs
had posts of beryl, and banisters and finials of crystal. The crystal
stairs had posts of crystal, and banisters and finials of beryl. Those
lotus ponds were surrounded by two balustrades, made of gold and silver.
The golden balustrades had posts of gold, and banisters and finials of
silver. The silver balustrades had posts of silver, and banisters and
finials of gold.

Then King Mahāsudassana thought, 'Why don't I plant flowers
in the lotus ponds such as blue water lilies, and lotuses of pink,
yellow, and white, blooming all year round, and accessible to the
public?' So that's what he did.

Then King Mahāsudassana thought, 'Why don't I appoint bath
attendants to help bathe the people who come to bathe in the lotus
ponds?' So that's what he did.

Then King Mahāsudassana thought, 'Why don't I set up
charities on the banks of the lotus ponds, so that those in need of
food, drink, clothes, vehicles, beds, women, coined gold, or uncoined
gold can get what they need?'[^556] So that's what he did.

Then the brahmins and householders came to the king bringing abundant
wealth and said,[^557] 'Sire, this abundant wealth is specially for you
alone; may Your Highness accept it!'

'There's enough raised for me through regular taxes. Let this be for
you; and here, take even more!'

When the king turned them down, they withdrew to one side to think up a
plan, 'It wouldn't be proper for us to take this abundant wealth back to
our own homes. Why don't we build a home for King
Mahāsudassana?'

They went up to the king and said, 'We shall have a home built for you,
sire!' King Mahāsudassana consented with silence.

And then Sakka, lord of gods, knowing the king's train of thought,
addressed the god Vissakamma, 'Come, dear Vissakamma, build a palace
named Principle as a home for King Mahāsudassana.'[^558]

'Yes, lord,' replied Vissakamma. Then, as easily as a strong person
would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the gods of the
thirty-three and appeared in front of King Mahāsudassana.

Vissakamma said to the king, 'I shall build a palace named Principle as
a home for you, sire.' King Mahāsudassana consented with
silence.

And so that's what Vissakamma did.

The Palace of Principle stretched for a league from east to west, and
half a league from north to south. It was lined with tiles of four
colors, three fathoms high, made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal.

It had 84,000 pillars of four colors, made of gold, silver, beryl, and
crystal. It was covered with panels of four colors, made of gold,
silver, beryl, and crystal.

It had twenty-four staircases of four colors, made of gold, silver,
beryl, and crystal. The golden stairs had posts of gold, and banisters
and finials of silver. The silver stairs had posts of silver, and
banisters and finials of gold. The beryl stairs had posts of beryl, and
banisters and finials of crystal. The crystal stairs had posts of
crystal, and banisters and finials of beryl.

It had 84,000 chambers of four colors,[^559] made of gold, silver,
beryl, and crystal. In each chamber a couch was spread: in the golden
chamber a couch of silver; in the silver chamber a couch of gold; in the
beryl chamber a couch of ivory; in the crystal chamber a couch of
hardwood. At the door of the golden chamber stood a palm tree of silver,
with trunk of silver, and leaves and fruits of gold. At the door of the
silver chamber stood a palm tree of gold, with trunk of gold, and leaves
and fruits of silver. At the door of the beryl chamber stood a palm tree
of crystal, with trunk of crystal, and leaves and fruits of beryl. At
the door of the crystal chamber stood a palm tree of beryl, with trunk
of beryl, and leaves and fruits of crystal.

Then King Mahāsudassana thought, 'Why don't I build a grove
of golden palm trees at the door to the great foyer, where I can sit for
the day?' So that's what he did.

The Palace of Principle was surrounded by two balustrades, made of gold
and silver. The golden balustrades had posts of gold, and banisters and
finials of silver. The silver balustrades had posts of silver, and
banisters and finials of gold.

The Palace of Principle was surrounded by two nets of bells, made of
gold and silver. The golden net had bells of silver, and the silver net
had bells of gold. When those nets of bells were blown by the wind they
sounded graceful, tantalizing, sensuous, lovely, and intoxicating, like
a quintet made up of skilled musicians who had practiced well and kept
excellent rhythm. And any addicts, carousers, or drunkards in
Kusāvatī at that time were entertained by that sound. When
it was finished, the palace was hard to look at, dazzling to the eyes.
It was like how in the last month of the rainy season, in autumn, when
the heavens are clear and cloudless, as the sun is rising to the
firmament, it is hard to look at, dazzling to the eyes.

Then King Mahāsudassana thought, 'Why don't I build a lotus
pond named Principle in front of the palace?' So that's what he did. The
Lotus Pond of Principle stretched for a league from east to west, and
half a league from north to south. It was lined with tiles of four
colors, made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal.

It had twenty-four staircases of four colors, made of gold, silver,
beryl, and crystal. The golden stairs had posts of gold, and banisters
and finials of silver. The silver stairs had posts of silver, and
banisters and finials of gold. The beryl stairs had posts of beryl, and
banisters and finials of crystal. The crystal stairs had posts of
crystal, and banisters and finials of beryl.

It was surrounded by two balustrades, made of gold and silver. The
golden balustrades had posts of gold, and banisters and finials of
silver. The silver balustrades had posts of silver, and banisters and
finials of gold.

It was surrounded by seven rows of palm trees, made of gold, silver,
beryl, crystal, ruby, emerald, and all precious things. The golden palms
had trunks of gold, and leaves and fruits of silver. The silver palms
had trunks of silver, and leaves and fruits of gold. The beryl palms had
trunks of beryl, and leaves and fruits of crystal. The crystal palms had
trunks of crystal, and leaves and fruits of beryl. The ruby palms had
trunks of ruby, and leaves and fruits of emerald. The emerald palms had
trunks of emerald, and leaves and fruits of ruby. The palms of all
precious things had trunks of all precious things, and leaves and fruits
of all precious things. When those rows of palm trees were blown by the
wind they sounded graceful, tantalizing, sensuous, lovely, and
intoxicating, like a quintet made up of skilled musicians who had
practiced well and kept excellent rhythm. And any addicts, carousers, or
drunkards in Kusāvatī at that time were entertained by that
sound.

When the palace and its lotus pond were finished, King
Mahāsudassana served those who were deemed true ascetics
and brahmins with all they desired. Then he ascended the Palace of
Principle.

_*The first recitation section.*_

## 5. Attaining Absorption

Then King Mahāsudassana thought, 'Of what deed of mine is
this the fruit and result, that I am now so mighty and powerful?'

Then King Mahāsudassana thought, 'It is the fruit and
result of three kinds of deeds:[^560] giving, self-control, and
restraint.'

Then he went to the great foyer, stood at the door, and expressed this
heartfelt sentiment:[^561] 'Stop here, sensual, malicious, and cruel
thoughts---[^562] no further!'

Then he entered the great foyer and sat on the golden couch. Quite
secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, he
entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and
bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it
connected.[^563] As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected
were stilled, he entered and remained in the second absorption, which
has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and
mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with
the fading away of rapture, he entered and remained in the third
absorption, where he meditated with equanimity, mindful and aware,
personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare,
'Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.' With the giving up of
pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, he
entered and remained in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain,
with pure equanimity and mindfulness.

Then King Mahāsudassana left the great foyer and entered
the golden chamber, where he sat on the golden couch. He meditated
spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and
to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way he spread a heart full
of love above, below, across, everywhere, all around, to everyone in the
world---abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. He
meditated spreading a heart full of compassion ... He meditated
spreading a heart full of rejoicing ... He meditated spreading a heart
full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the
third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across,
everywhere, all around, he spread a heart full of equanimity to the
whole world---abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill
will.

## 6. Of All Cities

King Mahāsudassana had 84,000 cities, with the royal
capital of Kusāvatī foremost. He had 84,000 palaces, with
the Palace of Principle foremost. He had 84,000 chambers, with the great
foyer foremost. He had 84,000 couches made of gold, silver, ivory, and
hardwood. They were spread with woollen covers---shag-piled, pure white,
or embroidered with flowers---and spread with a fine deer hide, with a
canopy above and red pillows at both ends.[^564] He had 84,000 bull
elephants with gold adornments and banners, covered with snow gold
netting, with the royal bull elephant named Sabbath foremost. He had
84,000 horses with gold adornments and banners, covered with snow gold
netting, with the royal steed named Thundercloud foremost. He had 84,000
chariots upholstered with the hide of lions, tigers, and leopards, and
cream rugs, with gold adornments and banners, covered with snow gold
netting, with the chariot named Triumph foremost.[^565] He had 84,000
jewels, with the jewel-treasure foremost. He had 84,000 women, with
Queen Subhaddā foremost. He had 84,000 householders, with
the householder-treasure foremost. He had 84,000 aristocrat vassals,
with the commander-treasure foremost. He had 84,000 milk-cows with
silken reins and bronze pails.[^566] He had 8,400,000,000 fine cloths of
linen, cotton, silk, and wool. He had 84,000 servings of food, which
were presented to him as offerings in the morning and evening.

Now at that time his 84,000 royal elephants came to attend on him in the
morning and evening. Then King Mahāsudassana thought, 'What
if instead half of the elephants took turns to attend on me at the end
of each century?'[^567] He instructed the commander-treasure to do this,
and so it was done.

## 7. The Visit of Queen Subhaddā

Then, after many years, many hundred years, many thousand years had
passed, Queen Subhaddā thought, 'It is long since I have
seen the king. Why don't I go to see him?'

So the queen addressed the ladies of the harem, 'Come, bathe your heads
and dress in yellow. It is long since we saw the king, and we shall go
to see him.'

'Yes, ma'am,' replied the ladies of the harem. They did as she asked and
returned to the queen.

Then the queen addressed the commander-treasure, 'Dear
commander-treasure, please ready the army of four divisions. It is long
since we saw the king, and we shall go to see him.'

'Yes, my queen,' he replied, and did as he was asked. He informed the
queen, 'My queen, the army of four divisions is ready, please go at your
convenience.'

Then Queen Subhaddā together with the ladies of the harem
went with the army to the Palace of Principle. She ascended the palace
and went to the great foyer, where she stood leaning against a
door-post.[^568]

Hearing them, the king thought, 'What's that, it sounds like a big
crowd!' Coming out of the foyer he saw Queen Subhaddā
leaning against a door-post and said to her, 'Please stay there, my
queen, don't enter in here.'[^569]

Then he addressed a certain man, 'Come, mister, bring the golden couch
from the great foyer and set it up in the golden palm grove.'

'Yes, Your Majesty,' that man replied, and did as he was asked. The king
laid down in the lion's posture---on the right side, placing one foot on
top of the other---mindful and aware.

Then Queen Subhaddā thought, 'The king's faculties are so
very clear, and the complexion of his skin is pure and bright. Let him
not pass away!' She said to him,[^570] 'Sire, you have 84,000 cities,
with the royal capital of Kusāvatī foremost. Arouse desire
for these! Take an interest in life!'[^571]

And she likewise urged the king to live on by taking an interest in all
his possessions as described above.

When the queen had spoken, the king said to her, 'For a long time, my
queen, you have spoken to me with words that are welcome, desirable,
agreeable, and pleasant. And yet in my final hour, your words are
unwelcome, undesirable, disagreeable, and unpleasant!'[^572]

'Then how exactly, Your Majesty, am I to speak to you?'

'Like this, my queen: "Sire, we must be parted and separated from all we
hold dear and beloved. Don't pass away with concerns. Such concern is
suffering, and it's criticized.[^573] Sire, you have 84,000 cities, with
the royal capital of Kusāvatī foremost. Give up desire for
these! Take no interest in life!"' And so on for all the king's
possessions.

When the king had spoken, Queen Subhaddā cried and burst
out in tears.[^574] Wiping away her tears, the queen said to the king:
'Sire, we must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and
beloved. Don't pass away with concerns. Such concern is suffering, and
it's criticized. Sire, you have 84,000 cities, with the royal capital of
Kusāvatī foremost. Give up desire for these! Take no
interest in life!' And she continued, listing all the king's
possessions.

## 8. Rebirth in the Realm of Divinity

Not long after that, King Mahāsudassana passed away. And
the feeling he had close to death was like a householder or their child
falling asleep after eating a delectable meal.[^575]

When he passed away King Mahāsudassana was reborn in a good
place, a realm of divinity. Ānanda, King Mahāsudassana
played children's games for 84,000 years. He ruled as viceroy for 84,000
years. He ruled as king for 84,000 years. He led the spiritual life as a
layman in the Palace of Principle for 84,000 years. And having developed
the four divine meditations, when his body broke up, after death, he was
reborn in a good place, a realm of divinity.

Now, Ānanda, you might think: 'Surely King Mahāsudassana
must have been someone else at that time?' But you should not see it
like that. I myself was King Mahāsudassana at that
time.[^576]

Mine were the 84,000 cities, with the royal capital of
Kusāvatī foremost. And mine were all the other possessions.

Of those 84,000 cities, I only stayed in one, the capital
Kusāvatī. Of those 84,000 mansions, I only dwelt in one,
the Palace of Principle. Of those 84,000 chambers, I only dwelt in the
great foyer. Of those 84,000 couches, I only used one, made of gold or
silver or ivory or heartwood. Of those 84,000 bull elephants, I only
rode one, the royal bull elephant named Sabbath. Of those 84,000 horses,
I only rode one, the royal horse named Thundercloud. Of those 84,000
chariots, I only rode one, the chariot named Triumph. Of those 84,000
women, I was only served by one, a maiden of the aristocratic or peasant
classes.[^577] Of those 8,400,000,000 cloths, I only wore one pair, made
of fine linen, cotton, silk, or wool. Of those 84,000 servings of food,
I only had one, eating at most a cup of rice with suitable sauce.

See, Ānanda! All those conditioned phenomena have passed, ceased, and
perished. So impermanent are conditions, so unstable are conditions, so
unreliable are conditions. This is quite enough for you to become
disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions.

Six times, Ānanda, I recall having laid down my body at this place. And
the seventh time was as a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled
king, at which time my dominion extended to all four sides, I achieved
stability in the country, and I possessed the seven treasures. But
Ānanda, I do not see any place in this world with its gods,
Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics
and brahmins, its gods and humans where the Realized One would lay down
his body for the eighth time."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "Oh! Conditions are impermanent,\
> their nature is to rise and fall;\
> having arisen, they cease;\
> their stilling is blissful."
