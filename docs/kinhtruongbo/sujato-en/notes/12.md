[^621]: This is the only appearance of a place called
    Sālavatikā ("Abounding in Sal Trees"). A courtesan of
    Rājagaha named Sālavatī appears in [Kd
    8:1.3.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/sujato#1.3.1); she
    might perhaps have come from there.

[^622]: A certain brahmin Lohicca also appears in [SN
    35.132](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.132/en/sujato). But since that
    is set far away in Avantī after the Buddha's passing,
    and since in both cases he is said to have taken refuge, it seems
    likely these are different people.

[^623]: A similar view is sometimes unjustly imputed to the
    Theravādins, that they are only interested in their own
    liberation.

[^624]: While *nhāpita* would seem to be identical with
   *nhāpaka* ("bathroom attendant"), it is usually
    translated per [Ja 395](https://suttacentral.net/ja395/en/sujato)
    where it means "barber".

[^625]: Note the unusual use of *kira* in this idiom, found in [SN
    35.133:2.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.133/en/sujato#2.3), [MN
    85:3.5](https://suttacentral.net/mn85/en/sujato#3.5), [MN
    127:2.5](https://suttacentral.net/mn127/en/sujato#2.5), and [Ud
    2.8:6.8](https://suttacentral.net/ud2.8/en/sujato#6.8). I think this
    expresses polite deference, and render with "might" rather than
    "would".

[^626]: It seems the barber was not only a trusted confidant, but an
    intelligent man with sincere concern for Lohicca's well being.

[^627]: The Buddha is modest as to his chances.

[^628]: Here the Buddha takes the initiative. "Harmful misconception" is
   *pāpakaṁ diṭṭhigataṁ*.

[^629]: Kosala is the native realm of Pasenadi. Kāsi had
    formerly been an independent kingdom, but was taken over by
    Pasenadi's father Mahākosala. Towards the end of the
    Buddha's life it was contested between Kosala and Magadha ([SN
    3.14](https://suttacentral.net/sn3.14/en/sujato), [SN
    3.15](https://suttacentral.net/sn3.15/en/sujato)). Ultimately it
    became part of the greater Magadhan empire.

[^630]: It is only through sharing what good things we know that we can
    support each other.

[^631]: Even though he has characterized Lohicca's view as harmful, the
    Buddha goes out of his way to show that it is not entirely wrong.
    There are cases where it is best to avoid teaching.

[^632]: The genders of this passage are made clear through the use of
    feminine nouns. Making unwelcome advances was seen as an obvious
    example of something wrong.

[^633]: At [DN 29:5.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato#5.2) the
    opposite sense is expressed as *samādāya
    taṁ dhammaṁ vattati*.

[^634]: The Buddha adopts Lohicca's formulation, but applies it in a
    specific sense, not as a generalization.

[^635]: Now that the Buddha has established a degree of overlap between
    their views, Lohicca wants to hear more.

[^636]: Again, the Buddha answers directly and simply.

[^637]: *Naraka* means "cliff" or "abyss" in early Pali ([MN
    49:5.9](https://suttacentral.net/mn49/en/sujato#5.9), [MN
    86:6.15](https://suttacentral.net/mn86/en/sujato#6.15), [Snp
    3.11:28.4](https://suttacentral.net/snp3.11/en/sujato#28.4), [Thag
    16.8:4.2](https://suttacentral.net/thag16.8/en/sujato#4.2)). It does
    not have the sense "hell" until the late canonical period; the early
    Pali term for hell is *niraya*. Notably, *naraka* is not strongly
    attested in the sense of "hell" for pre-Buddhist Sanskrit either,
    although we do find *nāraka*, apparently in the sense
    of "hell being", at Atharva Veda 12.4.36c and Śukla Yajur Veda 30.5.
