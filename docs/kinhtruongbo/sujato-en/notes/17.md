[^541]: Picking up the story of the Buddha's past life as King
    Mahāsudassana from [DN
    16:5.17.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#5.17.1).

[^542]: From here we leave [DN
    16](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato) behind and with it any
    semblance of realism. Some of these details are shared with [SN
    22.96](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.96/en/sujato), which however
    does not mention the name Mahāsudassana.

[^543]: Readings vary. The Sanskrit text has *saptapauruṣā
    ardhacaturthapauruṣāś ca nikhātā*.

[^544]: I think the point is that they listened to the music rather than
    doing bad things.

[^545]: This is specific instance, so I use past tense. Where it is an
    abstract description of a legendary past, I use the present tense to
    denote an eternal or mythic present.

[^546]: The wheel is firstly the sun and secondly the wheel of the
    chariots that drove the Indo-Europeans in their conquests. It is the
    manifestation of unstoppable power. The solar imagery is reflected
    in the name Mahāsudassana ("Great Splendor"). The whole
    story reflects the Indo-European dream of universal domination.

[^547]: Many of the details in this myth echo the Brahmanical horse
    sacrifice. Since the horse was the primary source of Indo-European
    dominion, its sacrifice served to authorize the power of a king. It
    was a costly and dangerous rite that was attempted only by the
    greatest of sovereigns. \| *Bhiṅkāra* ("ceremonial
    vase") and *abbhukkirati* ("besprinkled") are elevated terms.

[^548]: In the horse sacrifice, the horse is released for a year, while
    the king follows it with his army, claiming any land that it wanders
    on as his.

[^549]: Read *bhuñjati* at [MN
    98:10.30](https://suttacentral.net/mn98/en/sujato#10.30) with
    *yathābhuttañca bhuñjatha* at [DN
    17:1.9.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato#1.9.4), [DN
    26:6.7](https://suttacentral.net/dn26/en/sujato#6.7), and [MN
    129:35.7](https://suttacentral.net/mn129/en/sujato#35.7). These have
    sometimes been rendered "eat", "enjoy", or "govern". But compare the
    archaic English "use" meaning "the benefit or profit of lands". Thus
    *yathābhuttañca bhuñjatha* means "use as
    has been used", i.e. "maintain the current level of taxation".

[^550]: The Wheel plunges into the seas, while the sacrificial horse is
    born in the western and eastern seas.

[^551]: Historically, India has usually been divided into squabbling
    realms, but from an early age there was a dream of a unified and
    peaceful continent.

[^552]: "At the High Court" (*atthakaraṇapamukhe*) is
    uncertain. *Attha-* has many variants, including
    *aḍḍa-* and *aṭṭa-*.
    *Atthakaraṇa* normally refers to a king "sitting in
    judgment" as at [SN
    3.7:1.5](https://suttacentral.net/sn3.7/en/sujato#1.5) or [MN
    89:13.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn89/en/sujato#13.3). Here,
    however it is a place. *-Pamukha* is a standard descriptor of the
    attributes of a wheel-turning monarch in the sense of "finest" (eg.
    [DN 17:2.5.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato#2.5.1)) rather
    than "entrance". Thus I take it as meaning "the supreme place of
    judgment" i.e. "High Court".

[^553]: The white elephant is a symbol of royalty to this day. The
    description recalls Indra's elephant Airāvata. \| For
    *sattappatiṭṭho*, the commentary has
    *susaṇṭhitaaṅgapaccaṅga* ("well-grounded on each and
    every limb"), a sense confirmed by the Mūlasarvāstivāda
    Bhaiṣajyavastu which has *saptāṅgaḥ
    supratiṣṭhito* ("well-established on seven limbs"). The
    subcommentary lists the four feet, trunk, tail, and penis
    (*varaṅga*).

[^554]: The sacrificial horse is likewise white with black head or
    forequarters. It is identified with the sun, thus being a
    "sky-walker". "Thundercloud" (*valāhaka*; Sanskrit
    *balāhaka*) is the name of one of the four horses of
    Kṛṣṇa's chariot in the Mahābharata. The
    description here also recalls the Vedic sacred horse
    *uccaiḥśravas*.

[^555]: The "commander" (*pariṇāyaka*) is mostly found in
    Buddhist texts of this context, and is not a regular term of
    governance. This passage shows that he was responsible for
    management of the realm, while below he appears as commander of the
    army ([DN 17:2.8.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato#2.8.2)).
    Elsewhere he is said to excel in strategy ([AN
    5.134:2.5](https://suttacentral.net/an5.134/en/sujato#2.5)).

[^556]: The jarring inclusion of "women" (*itthī*) in this
    list probably refers to state-sponsored prostitution.

[^557]: As at [DN 5:19.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn5/en/sujato#19.1).

[^558]: The palace is named "Principle" (*dhamma*) in recognition of the
    king being subject to a higher law. Normally I translate
    *pāsāda* as "stilt longhouse" but here something
    grander is meant.

[^559]: For *kūṭāgāra* as "chamber" see [MN
    37:8.10](https://suttacentral.net/mn37/en/sujato#8.10).

[^560]: Thus denying the doctrine of Pūraṇa Kassapa at [DN
    2:17.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#17.5). This is the
    recognition, at least partially, of right view.

[^561]: The *mahāviyūha* must have been some kind of
    structure at the entrance to the palace, a "foyer".

[^562]: These are the three factors of right thought. The king
    skillfully uses a transition in physical space to set up his
    intention to meditate.

[^563]: Here as in [DN 1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato),
    *jhāna* is not a uniquely Buddhist practice.

[^564]: This segment breaks the expected pattern of "foremost" things.

[^565]: Not the British car of the same name. The chariot is the source
    of victory in battle.

[^566]: Read *dukūlasandanāni*, where *dukūla*
    is "fine cloth, silk" and *sandana* is "cord, tether".

[^567]: An odd detail. Maybe the sound of the elephants disturbed his
    meditation?

[^568]: Like Ānanda at [DN
    16:5.13.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#5.13.1).

[^569]: He makes it clear that this will not be an intimate visit.

[^570]: The aorist is not past tense, as it is governed by
    *mā*.

[^571]: "Desire" is *chanda*, the first of the four bases of psychic
    power, which in [DN
    16:3.3.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#3.3.1) are said to
    lead to long life. By urging him to live long, she inverts the
    Mahāparinibbānasutta where Ānanda fails to do the same.

[^572]: Implying that Ānanda was right to not beg the Buddha to live
    long.

[^573]: At [AN 6.16:2.2](https://suttacentral.net/an6.16/en/sujato#2.2)
    this advice is given by Nakula's mother.

[^574]: Like Ānanda at [DN
    16:5.13.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#5.13.1).

[^575]: This contrasts with the Buddha's last meal at [DN
    16:4.20.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#4.20.1), which
    caused sickness and distress. The Buddha was rejecting existence
    entirely, whereas Mahāsudassana was continuing in a
    pleasant form of conditioned existence.

[^576]: After [DN
    5:21.16](https://suttacentral.net/dn5/en/sujato#21.16), this is the
    second Jātaka in the Dīghanikāya.

[^577]: Accepting the Mahāsaṅgīti's reading of
    *vessinī*. I believe the variant
    *velāmikā* is a ghost word contaminated from [AN
    9.20:4.1](https://suttacentral.net/an9.20/en/sujato#4.1).
