[^1]: In the suttas, *apadāna* means "evidence", "traces
    left behind" ([DN
    27:16.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn27/en/sujato#16.4), [DN
    24:2.7.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn24/en/sujato#2.7.3), [MN
    15:3.32](https://suttacentral.net/mn15/en/sujato#3.32), [AN
    3.2:1.1](https://suttacentral.net/an3.2/en/sujato#1.1)). The sense
    here seems to have been "(story about) the traces that deeds leave
    behind". The sense "legend of past lives" probably grew out of this
    sutta, and later became the title of the collections of legends of
    past lives of the monks (Thera-apadāna) and nuns
    (Therī-apadāna).

[^2]: *Kareri* is evidently *Miliusa tomentosa*, known as *hoom* or
    *kari* in Hindi. It is related to the custard apple, not the curry
    tree (*Murraya koenigii*).

[^3]: "Past life" is *pubbenivāsa*, literally "former
    abode".

[^4]: At [MN 71:14.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn71/en/sujato#14.2) and
    [SN 42.9:4.5](https://suttacentral.net/sn42.9/en/sujato#4.5) the
    Buddha says he recollects ninety-one eons, which must refer back to
    the life of Vipassī. We shall see the origin of his
    name below.

[^5]: *Sikhī* means "crested one" and refers to a halo or
    crown. A story of him and his disciples is told at [SN
    6.14:8.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn6.14/en/sujato#8.3).

[^6]: *Vessabhū* is Sanskrit Viśvabhṛt. It
    means "all-bearing", probably originating as a word for the earth. A
    legendary king of the same name once ruled over the city of
    Avantī ([DN
    19:36.14](https://suttacentral.net/dn19/en/sujato#36.14)).

[^7]: Due to the appearance of four Buddhas in this cycle it is known as
    "fortunate" (*bhadda*). \| Stories from Kakusandha's day appear at
    [MN 50](https://suttacentral.net/mn50/en/sujato) and [SN
    15.20:2.8](https://suttacentral.net/sn15.20/en/sujato#2.8). There is
    no obvious etymology for his name, but perhaps it stems from *kaku*
    ("peak") and thus "the union of the peaks", a valley at the junction
    of mountains.

[^8]: The meaning of Koṇāgamana is unclear. In Sanskrit it
    is often spelled Kanakamuni, "the golden sage", while in the
    (dubious) Nigali Sagar Edict of Ashoka it is
    Konākamana. At [Thig
    16.1:71.1](https://suttacentral.net/thig16.1/en/sujato#71.1) we hear
    the past life of three nuns in the time of Koṇāgamana.

[^9]: Kassapa (Sanskrit Kaśyapa) means "tortoise". It is a
    common Brahmanical clan name, stemming from an ancient figure
    reckoned as the eldest of the "seven sages", to whom some Vedic
    verses are attributed. Details of the Buddha Kassapa's time are
    found at [MN 81](https://suttacentral.net/mn81/en/sujato), [SN
    15.20:4.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn15.20/en/sujato#4.1), and [SN
    48.57:3.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.57/en/sujato#3.1).

[^10]: These numbers make up a quasi-logarithmic scale: the time gaps
    multiply by three, while the number of Buddhas divides by two. In
    eon one there are four Buddhas. Thirty eons ago the number is
    halved, so they had two Buddhas. Twice-thirty eons before that, the
    number is halved again, to one Buddha, thus ending the scale.

[^11]: In ancient India, the "aristocrats" (*khattiya*) and the brahmins
    vied for the prestige of being the highest class. The traditional
    business of the aristocrats was land, politics, agriculture, and
    war, while the brahmins were a hereditary priestly caste who served
    as advisers and ritualists. It is said that the Buddha-to-be was
    born in whatever caste was most prestigious at the time so that his
    word would have the most impact. \| In this sutta, the Buddha simply
    refers to himself as "I" with no personal name. When the seven
    Buddhas are listed at [DN
    32:3.14](https://suttacentral.net/dn32/en/sujato#3.14), however, he
    is called Aṅgīrasa.

[^12]: The Koṇḍaññas (Sanskrit Kauṇḍinya)
    originated as the leading clan of the city of Kuṇḍina
    the capital of Vidarbha, which is probably modern Kaundinyapura on
    the Wardha River.

[^13]: Gotama is an ancient Brahmanical clan name, which like Kassapa
    stems from the Vedas and the seven sages. Why does the Buddha, an
    aristocrat, have a Brahmanical clan? During initiation by a
    Brahmanical family priest (*purohita*), an aristocrat was ritually
    determined to be a brahmin for a short time, during which he would
    assume the lineage name of the priest. After being restored as an
    aristocrat, he and his family would still be referred to by that
    name. Thus the Sakyans' *purohita* must have been of the Gotama
    lineage. Other examples of this practice include the Mallas who are
    called Vāseṭṭha ([DN
    16:5.19.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#5.19.2)) and
    Saccaka who is called Aggivessana ([MN
    35:4.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn35/en/sujato#4.2)). The Jain
    Ācārāṅgasūtra 2.15.15 records a similar situation, for
    while Mahāvīra was, like the Buddha, a *khattiya*, he
    was of the Kāśyapa *gotta*, and various relatives were
    assigned to Vāsiṣṭha, Kauṇḍinya, and
    Kauśika.

[^14]: *Stereospermum chelonoides*. Dictionaries of Pali and Sanskrit
    call this the "trumpet-flower tree", but that is more commonly used
    for *Oroxylum indicum*.

[^15]: *Puṇḍarīka* is the white lotus, but here it is the
    name of a tree. The commentary says this is *setamba*
    ("white-mango"). It is not, however, the mango variety known by that
    name today (*Mangifera caesia*), which is not found in India.

[^16]: *Shorea robusta*.

[^17]: *Albizia lebbeck*, sometimes still known by the old name of
    sirisa. Older sources sometimes call it an acacia.

[^18]: *Ficus racemosa*.

[^19]: *Ficus benghalensis*.

[^20]: *Ficus religiosa*, sacred to Buddhists, Jains, and Hindus alike.
    Ancient sources referred to it both as *assattha* (Sanskrit
    *aśvattha*) and *pippala*. Buddhists today simply call
    it the Bodhi (or Bo) tree.

[^21]: The number of disciples diminishes as we approach historical
    time.

[^22]: An extensive journey of the Buddha with 1,250 mendicants is
    documented in [Kd 6](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/sujato),
    at one point of which occurs the events of the Selasutta ([Snp
    3.7](https://suttacentral.net/snp3.7/en/sujato) and [MN
    91](https://suttacentral.net/mn91/en/sujato)). The Buddha is also
    accompanied by 1,250 mendicants in the
    Sāmaññaphalasutta ([DN
    2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato)) and the Parosahassasutta
    ([SN 8.8](https://suttacentral.net/sn8.8/en/sujato)).

[^23]: The son of King Dawn and Queen Radiant at the City of the Dawn,
    Sikhī is the streaming rays of sunrise. These names
    recall a solar myth.

[^24]: In Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa ch. 131, a
    Pabhāvatī, daughter of the king of Vidarbha, is said to
    have married Marutta, king of Vajjī.

[^25]: There is an Arunawati River in Maharashtra, not far from the
    ancient homeland of the Koṇḍaññas in
    Kuṇḍina.

[^26]: Vessabhū's parents King Goodfall and Queen Rainy
    recall a seasonal fertility myth, where they gave life to their son
    the earth, "the nourisher and bearer of all". Note, however the
    variants *suppatīta* ("well pleased") and
    *yasavatī* ("celebrated").

[^27]: The names of the brahmin fathers all refer to ritual offerings.
    Aggidatta means "offered to the fire".

[^28]: The names of the brahmin mothers all recall Indian *nakkhatta*.
    These are "constellations" or more properly "lunar mansions";
    segments of the sky through which the Moon passes and which are
    associated with certain stars or clusters. In the Atharvaveda
    system, Visākhā is the 16th lunar asterism (Libra).

[^29]: Based on the Ashoka pillar there, this is identified with modern
    Gotihawa, southeast of Kapilavastu in Nepal.

[^30]: "Offered in sacrifice".

[^31]: Several constellations are distinguished as "former" (*pubba*)
    and "later" (*uttara*). Since it lies between Visākhā
    and Dhanavatī, this may be the 21st constellation,
    Uttara Āṣāḍhā (Sagittarius/Capricorn).

[^32]: If the dubious Ashokan edict there is to be believed, this was
    traditionally identified with the town known today as Nigali Sagar
    near Kapilavastu in Nepal.

[^33]: "Offered to Brahmā". Many of the
    Jātakas feature a king of this name, usually said to
    reside in Benares.

[^34]: Dhanavatī means "wealthy", but it is also an
    alternate name for the 23rd constellation, *dhaniṣṭhā*
    (or *śraviṣṭā*, Delphinus).

[^35]: Kikī ("blue jay") appears in the story of the past
    Buddha Kassapa at [MN 81](https://suttacentral.net/mn81/en/sujato).

[^36]: Suddhodana means "white rice". He is mentioned by name at [Thag
    10.1:8.1](https://suttacentral.net/thag10.1/en/sujato#8.1), [Snp
    3.11:7.2](https://suttacentral.net/snp3.11/en/sujato#7.2), and [Kd
    1:54.1.4](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#54.1.4).

[^37]: Māyā means "illusion". She is mentioned by name at
    [Thag 10.1:8.2](https://suttacentral.net/thag10.1/en/sujato#8.2) and
    [Thig 6.6:6.2](https://suttacentral.net/thig6.6/en/sujato#6.2).

[^38]: "Principle of the teachings" is *dhammadhātu*. At
    [SN 12.32:18.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.32/en/sujato#18.1),
    Sāriputta's mastery of the *dhammadhātu*
    gives him the ability to answer any questions on the Dhamma.

[^39]: These characteristics of the birth of the Buddha-to-be are also
    found in [MN 123](https://suttacentral.net/mn123/en/sujato), where
    Ānanda quotes the Buddha, although the wording is a little different
    and three extra details are added at the start. In addition, this
    detail and that about emerging mindfully from the womb are found at
    [AN 4.127](https://suttacentral.net/an4.127/en/sujato). \| Normally
    in early Pali, the word *bodhisatta* is reserved for the
    Buddha-to-be once he has left home and is practicing "intent on
    awakening" (eg. [MN
    26:13.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn26/en/sujato#13.1)). This
    passage extends the usage back as far as the end of the immediate
    past life.

[^40]: "Normal" is *dhammatā*, a natural principle. This
    entire passage differs from the earliest concept of the bodhisatta
    ("one intent on awakening"), which in early texts is typically
    applied to Siddhattha after he left the home.

[^41]: The commentary identifies this realm of "utter darkness"
    (*andhakāratimisā*) with a cold hell realm. There is a
    corresponding Purāṇic hell called
    *andhatāmisra*. \| *Asaṁvutā* was
    translated by Ñāṇamoḷī as "abysmal", but this relies on
    a commentarial cosmology that is not found in the suttas. The sense,
    rather, is "boundless". The root harks back to the Vedic serpent
    Vṛtra who wraps the world in darkness. \|
    *Nānubhonti* ("makes no impression") is glossed in the
    commentary to [AN 4.127](https://suttacentral.net/an4.127/en/sujato)
    as *nappahonti* "ineffective".

[^42]: The light is a physical one, not just a metaphor. From this, it
    appears that sentient beings may be spontaneously reborn in
    interstellar space. Compare the problem of the "Boltzmann brain" in
    physics.

[^43]: These are the Four Great Kings, regarded as protector deities.

[^44]: The five precepts.

[^45]: While sensual pleasures provoke attachment, they are nonetheless
    a kind of pleasure and therefore a sign of virtue and good past
    kamma.

[^46]: This tragic detail is also mentioned in [Ud
    5.2](https://suttacentral.net/ud5.2/en/sujato). The Buddha is raised
    by a step-mother, which in our Buddha's case was Māyā's
    sister Mahāpajāpatī ([AN
    8.51:9.8](https://suttacentral.net/an8.51/en/sujato#9.8), [MN
    142:3.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn142/en/sujato#3.3)).

[^47]: Ten signifies fullness and completion, as for example the "ten
    directions". \| The notion that the term of pregnancy was "nine or
    ten months" is also found at Chāndogya
    Upaniṣad 5.9.1. In the Rig Veda it is typically "in the
    tenth month" (5.78.7, 10.84.3).

[^48]: In illustrations she is depicted standing while holding a tree in
    the pose known as *sālabhañjikā*, a common motif in
    Indian art representing the abundance of springtime.

[^49]: Kāsi is the nation of which Varanasi is the capital.
    Their cloth was of exceptional quality.

[^50]: This passage implies that Buddhahood was destined from the time
    of birth, which stands in contrast to the rest of the suttas, where
    Buddhahood was hard-won by the Bodhisatta's efforts while striving
    for awakening. \| "Stands firm on his own feet" signifies that he
    will be awakened by his own efforts. \| "North" is *uttara*, which
    is also "the beyond"; this predicts his attaining Nibbana. \| "Seven
    strides" signifies crossing over the vast cycles of birth and death,
    especially by developing the seven awakening factors. \| The "white
    parasol" signifies purity and royalty. \| "Surveying all quarters"
    signifies his universal knowledge. \| The "dramatic proclamation" is
    *āsabhiṁ vācaṁ*, literally the "voice of a
    bull". Other contexts show that this is is an expression emphasizing
    speech that is dramatic and imposing ([SN
    52.9:3.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn52.9/en/sujato#3.2), [DN
    28:1.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn28/en/sujato#1.5) = [SN
    47.12:5.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.12/en/sujato#5.2)). \| At
    Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.1.1 and
    Chāndogya Upaniṣad 5.1.1 the "vital
    breath" (*prāṇa*) is said to be "eldest and first"
    (*jyeṣṭhaśca śreṣṭhaśca*).

[^51]: Many of the details of the following account were later
    incorporated into the life of Gotama, under the principle that the
    major events of the lives of Buddhas follow a natural order.
    Nonetheless, they are not always consistent with other accounts in
    early texts. For example, in the Attadaṇḍasutta the
    Buddha says his going forth was prompted by disillusionment and fear
    due to chronic conflict and warfare ([Snp
    4.15](https://suttacentral.net/snp4.15/en/sujato)).

[^52]: In [Snp 3.11](https://suttacentral.net/snp3.11/en/sujato), the
    newborn Siddhattha is examined by the dark hermit Asita. These two
    versions are combined in later accounts.

[^53]: Asita did not look at the 32 marks, and he predicted only one
    destiny: that he would become a Buddha.

[^54]: Various "treasures" (*ratana*) or "gems" of a king are discussed
    in such texts as Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5.3.1.

[^55]: The marks are elsewhere listed in [DN
    30:1.2.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn30/en/sujato#1.2.1) and [MN
    91:9.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn91/en/sujato#9.1). Here I list
    the related marks in the Bṛhatsaṁhitā as identified by
    Nathan McGovern (*On the Origins of the 32 Marks of a Great Man*,
    Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, 2016,
    vol. 39, pp. 207--247).

[^56]: This echoes the posture of the newborn bodhisatta, and has the
    same meaning: that he will become awakened by "standing on his own
    two feet".

[^57]: These leave marks that were seen by Doṇa ([AN
    4.36:1.3](https://suttacentral.net/an4.36/en/sujato#1.3)). They are
    often depicted in Buddhist art, signifying the perfection and
    completeness of the traces that the Buddha leaves behind in his
    teachings and practice. Bṛhatsaṁhitā 69.17 lists
    several auspicious marks, including the wheel.

[^58]: Described as "abundantly long" at [DN
    30:1.12.8](https://suttacentral.net/dn30/en/sujato#1.12.8).

[^59]: Same at Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.36.

[^60]: Tender feet at Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.2.

[^61]: Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.2 has *śliṣtāṅgulī*
    ("compact or sticky fingers"). The commentary denies that the Pali
    *jāla* means a physical web. I think it means that the
    fingers and toes were usually held together rather than splayed,
    hence not letting things slip through the fingers.

[^62]: *Ussaṅkha* means "(curved) up like a shell", while
    Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.2 says "curved up like a tortoise". The
    descriptive verse at [DN
    30:1.21.12](https://suttacentral.net/dn30/en/sujato#1.21.12) shows
    that it refers to the tops of the feet.

[^63]: These are presumably the long, elegant rear calves of the Indian
    Blackbuck.

[^64]: This agrees with Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.35.

[^65]: Same at Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.8.

[^66]: Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.102 says kings have a shining
    complexion.

[^67]: Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.102 mentions a "clean complexion"
    (*śuddha*).

[^68]: Same at Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.5.

[^69]: Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.26 says those with hairs turning
    right become kings.

[^70]: Here *brahm-* is an adjective from √*brah* + *ma*, equivalent to
    the Sanskrit *bṛṁh*, having the sense "grown,
    extended". The Sanskrit form here is *bṛhadṛjugātra*.

[^71]: Hands, feet, shoulders, and chest ([DN
    30:1.13.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn30/en/sujato#1.13.5)).

[^72]: Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.18 compares not the chest but the
    hips with a lion.

[^73]: Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.27 says the heart is raised and
    muscular.

[^74]: Bṛhatsaṁhitā 69.13 has the same proportions without
    the simile. These are the normal human proportions, yet we cannot
    touch our knees without bending. The only way these marks could be
    reconciled is if the arms were extra long and the length of the legs
    below the knees was extra long as well. And this is exactly what we
    are told: the ankles are stretched and long, and the calves are like
    those of an antelope, whose rear calves are long proportionate to
    the thigh. Thus in this regard the marks appear to be internally
    consistent, though not describing normal human anatomy.

[^75]: "Ridged taste buds" is *rasaggasaggī*. *Rasa* can
    mean either "taste" or "nutrition", but the use of
    *ojā* in [DN
    30:2.9.8](https://suttacentral.net/dn30/en/sujato#2.9.8) confirms
    the latter. *Gasa* is "swallow" and per [DN
    30:2.7.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn30/en/sujato#2.7.4) it is the
    "conveyance of savor" (*rasaharaṇīyo*). *Agga* often
    means "best", but this is derived from the primary sense of "peak".
    The descriptors *uddhagga* ("raised") at [DN
    30:2.7.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn30/en/sujato#2.7.4) and
    *susaṇṭhitā* ("prominent") at [DN
    30:2.9.8](https://suttacentral.net/dn30/en/sujato#2.9.8) confirm
    that the latter is meant. The mark refers to taste buds raised in
    noticeable ridges on the tongue that absorb nutrition and aid
    digestion. It has often been interpreted as "excellent
    (*aggī*) sense (*gasa*) of taste (*rasa*)", but this,
    being imperceptible to others, is rather a secondary consequence of
    the mark.

[^76]: Even, gapless, and white teeth are at Bṛhatsaṁhitā
    68.52.

[^77]: Same at Bṛhatsaṁhitā 68.53.

[^78]: At [Thig
    13.1:6.2](https://suttacentral.net/thig13.1/en/sujato#6.2)
    Ambapālī describes her eyes as *abhinīla*.
    While some Indians do indeed have blue eyes, this probably describes
    a black so deep it appears blue.

[^79]: Cows have long and elegant eyelashes.

[^80]: The *uṇhīsa* is depicted as a bulge on the Buddha's
    crown.

[^81]: This is the *dakkhiṇā*, the religious offering given
    in gratitude and respect for the services.

[^82]: His birth mother has passed away and there is no mention of a
    step-mother.

[^83]: Normally clairvoyance and related abilities are said to arise due
    to the power of the fourth *jhāna*, whereas here it
    comes naturally due to past kamma. After *jhāna* this
    ability is empowered by the radiant mind clear of hindrances,
    whereas here it seems to be a more limited ability to see clearly
    and in the dark.

[^84]: Vipassī's name is simply the personal form of the
    word made famous in Buddhist meditation, *vipassanā*.
    This is usually rendered as "insight", but the sense here is more
    like "clear seeing".

[^85]: Indian epistemology acknowledges two fundamental sources of
    knowledge: direct perception (*paccakkha*) and inference
    (*anumāna*). This passage shows that
    *vipassanā* includes both. I render
    *vipassanā* with "discernment" in an attempt to capture
    both nuances, rather than the standard "insight".

[^86]: Here begins the story of the four signs that led to
    Vipassī's going forth---an old man, a sick man, a dead
    man, and a renunciate. Later texts apply the same story to
    Siddhattha, indeed to all bodhisattvas. \| These four "signs"
    (*nimitta*) are also called "messengers of the gods", reckoned as
    five ([MN 130](https://suttacentral.net/mn130/en/sujato)) or three
    ([AN 3.36](https://suttacentral.net/an3.36/en/sujato)).

[^87]: *Antepuraṁ* ("royal compound") was the inner sanctum
    of the royal residence. Maximally it referred to the area enclosed
    by walls within which the ruling families and staff lived. It later
    became used in the more restricted sense of "harem".

[^88]: "Brood" is *pajjhāyati*. He is having an existential
    crisis.

[^89]: In any story of prophecy, efforts are made to avert it and they
    invariably fail. This is a recursive property of prophetic myth. If
    the prophecy were averted, the myth would not exist and we would not
    know of it; but because the myth does exist, we know how it ends and
    the prophecy must come true.

[^90]: An existential crisis takes its own time; it cannot be rushed.

[^91]: Neither reading *vilāta* or *milāta*
    appears to occur elsewhere in this sense. The commentary says it is
    a bier (*sivika*).

[^92]: "Renunciate" is *pabbajita* ("one who has gone forth"), one of
    the many words for religious ascetics. It is a general term and does
    not specify his affiliation.

[^93]: "Celebrate" is *sādhu*, the famous Buddhist words of
    approval and rejoicing still heard every day in
    Theravāda Buddhist cultures. It later acquired the
    meaning "renunciate" but does not have that sense in early Pali. The
    virtues that he celebrates are common values of Indian religions.

[^94]: His apparently sudden decision to go forth arises only after an
    extensive period of crisis and contemplation.

[^95]: The idea that a whole populace would follow the bodhisatta on his
    renunciate path occurs several times in the Jātakas.

[^96]: Following the PTS edition in omitting *janapada*, which is absent
    from the commentary and the parallel passage at [DN
    19:58.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn19/en/sujato#58.3).

[^97]: This is the only place *vāsūpagata* ("entered his
    dwelling") is added to this stock phrase.

[^98]: At [SN 12.4](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.4/en/sujato)--10 this
    same reflection is attributed to each of the seven past Buddhas,
    kicking off an investigation into dependent origination in reverse
    order, starting with the outcome: suffering. Here this is treated as
    a meditative contemplation, whereas the next sutta, [DN
    15](https://suttacentral.net/dn15/en/sujato)
    Mahānidānasutta, delves into the philosophical
    implications.

[^99]: The reflection shows how the bodhisatta is still digging into the
    trauma of discovering the reality of old age and death.

[^100]: *Yoniso maniskāra* ("rational application of mind")
    is a distinctively Buddhist term that literally means "applying the
    mind by way of source". It is mostly used in investigating
    causality, although over time it came to have a more general sense
    of "reflection, inquiry, attention".

[^101]: Here begins the sequence of dependent origination. I give basic
    definitions of terms here, and more details in [DN
    15](https://suttacentral.net/dn15/en/sujato). \| Rebirth is a
    necessary antecedent condition for old age and death. Note that it
    is not a *sufficient* condition for old age, for many die when
    young.

[^102]: Since there cannot be an end to the "birth" that starts this
    life, *jāti* means "rebirth", the next stage in the
    ongoing cycle.

[^103]: *Bhava* means "being, existence, life" in the sense of "past and
    future lives". It refers to the ongoing process of continued
    existence, transmigrating through life after life. By itself,
    *bhava* has a positive connotation, and represents the longing that
    many people have to continue to exist after death in a permanent and
    happy state. The Buddha, however, situates it as just one more
    dimension of the flow of conditions.

[^104]: "Grasping" (*upādāna*) at sensual pleasures, views,
    precepts and observances, and theories of a self ([DN
    15:6.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn15/en/sujato#6.3)). Grasping has
    the active sense of "taking up" a new life, not just "clinging" to
    what one has. It has a dual sense, because it also means the "fuel"
    that sustains the fire of existence.

[^105]: Craving (*taṇhā*, literally "thirst") and grasping
    have a similar meaning, but craving is primal desire while grasping
    is more complex, involving doctrines and behaviors.

[^106]: "Feeling" (*vedanā*) is more fundamental than the
    complex concept of "emotion". It refers to the hedonic tone of
    experience as pleasant, painful, or neutral.

[^107]: "Contact" is literally "touch" (*phassa*), and refers to the
    stimulation that occurs when sense object meets sense organ in
    experience.

[^108]: The five senses with the mind as sixth. This topic is treated
    extensively throughout early Buddhism, with a special focus on
    understanding and restraining the pull of sense stimulation.
    *Āyatana* has a root sense "stretch", from which derived senses
    include "dimension", "field", etc.

[^109]: "Name and form" (*nāmarūpa*) is a Vedic concept
    referring to the multiplicity of material forms
    (*rūpa*) and associated names (*nāma*),
    especially the individual "sentient organisms" such as gods and
    humans (Rig Veda 5.43.10, Bṛhadāraṇyaka
    Upaniṣad 1.6.1), which are ultimately absorbed into the
    divine, like rivers in the ocean (Muṇḍaka
    Upaniṣad 3.2.8, Praśna
    Upaniṣad 6.5). The Buddha treated "name" analytically
    as feeling, perception, intention, contact, and application of mind,
    and "form" as the four elements and derived matter ([DN
    15:20.8](https://suttacentral.net/dn15/en/sujato#20.8), [MN
    9:52--54.7](https://suttacentral.net/mn9/en/sujato#52-54.7), and [SN
    12.2:11.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.2/en/sujato#11.1)).

[^110]: "Consciousness" (*viññāṇa*) is simple subjective
    awareness, the sense of knowing. It arises stimulated by either an
    external sense impression or a mental phenomena such as thought,
    memory, etc. It is the subjective awareness that makes the entire
    multiform world of concepts and appearances possible. Thus far the
    analysis agrees with Yājñavalkya, who says that the
    manifold appearances in the world arise from consciousness (*etebhyo
    bhūtebhyaḥ samutthāya*,
    Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.12).

[^111]: Here the Buddha decisively departs from
    Yājñavalkya's view that individuated awareness
    (*saññā*) returns into "this great reality, infinite,
    unbounded, a sheer mass of consciousness" (*idaṁ
    mahadbhūtam anantam apāraṁ
    vijñānaghana eva*, Bṛhadāraṇyaka
    Upaniṣad 2.4.12). Consciousness
    (*viññāṇa*) is not a fundamental reality
    (*mahadbhūta*) underlying multiplicity, but rather a
    conditioned process that exists only together with name and form.

[^112]: Dependent origination normally continues with two further
    factors: choices and ignorance. The full series does not appear in
    the Dīghanikāya. This truncated series emphasizes the
    mutuality of name and form with consciousness, but does not preclude
    the normal linear series. Each presentation of dependent origination
    reveals a different aspect of a complex, ramified process.

[^113]: Note the use of repetition to sum up the main doctrinal
    teachings. This serves to lock the sequence in memory and ensure no
    items are missing or displaced, while for one who is reciting the
    text from memory it provides an opportunity to reflect and apply the
    meaning in their own experience.

[^114]: This phrasing recalls the Buddha's first sermon ([SN
    56.11:5.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11/en/sujato#5.1)), an
    insight that is said to be common to all Buddhas ([SN
    56.12:1.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.12/en/sujato#1.1)). *Pubbe
    ananussutesu* ("not learned before from another") means that this is
    a fresh insight not passed down in an oral tradition.

[^115]: The PTS edition has *vipassanā-maggo* here, despite
    admitting the term is found in no manuscripts and is taken from the
    commentary, where it is clearly an explanation not a reading
    (*maggoti vipassanāmaggo*). This error is followed by
    Rhys Davids and Walshe in their translations.

[^116]: Insight into dependent origination here indicates the attaining
    of stream entry.

[^117]: The five grasping aggregates
    (*pañcūpādānakkhandhā*) are mentioned as a summary of
    suffering in the Buddha's first sermon ([SN
    56.11:4.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11/en/sujato#4.2)). Most of
    the teachings on this topic are collected in the
    Khandhasaṁyutta at SN 22, but they are also found in
    the Dīghanikāya at [DN
    22:14.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn22/en/sujato#14.1), [DN
    33:1.11.45](https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#1.11.45), [DN
    33:2.1.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#2.1.4), and [DN
    34:1.6.16](https://suttacentral.net/dn34/en/sujato#1.6.16). The
    contemplation on the aggregates dispels the mistaken assumption of a
    self. Many of the theorists in [DN
    1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato) identify the self with
    one or other of the aggregates.

[^118]: *Saṅkhāra* in early Buddhism has three main
    doctrinal senses. (1) The broadest sense is "conditioned phenomena",
    which we find in the Dīghanikāya at [DN
    16:6.10.10](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#6.10.10), [DN
    17:2.16.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato#2.16.1), and [DN
    34:1.8.59](https://suttacentral.net/dn34/en/sujato#1.8.59). This
    essentially means "everything except Nibbana". (2) Sometimes it is a
    physical or mental "process" or "activity" as at [DN
    18:24.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn18/en/sujato#24.1), where it
    refers to the gradual stilling of energies in the development of
    meditation. (3) In the five aggregates and dependent origination it
    has the sense of "morally potent volitions or choices" and is a
    synonym for *cetanā* ("intention"). It is defined as
    good, bad, and imperturbable choices ([DN
    33:1.10.77](https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#1.10.77)), the
    latter of which refers to the kamma of the fourth
    *jhāna* and above. In this sense it is the moral
    "choices" for good or ill that propel consciousness into a new
    rebirth.

[^119]: The radical thesis of the Buddha's teaching is the idea that
    consciousness is merely another empirical phenomena that comes to an
    end, as is also emphasized in the concluding verses of [DN
    11](https://suttacentral.net/dn11/en/sujato).

[^120]: This indicates the attainment of arahantship, the complete
    release from all attachments leading to rebirth.

[^121]: No longer a bodhisatta, he is now called a Buddha for the first
    time.

[^122]: In early Buddhism, the idea of teaching the Dhamma only arose
    after awakening.

[^123]: A similar account is told of Gotama Buddha at [SN
    6.1:1.4](https://suttacentral.net/sn6.1/en/sujato#1.4), [MN
    26:19.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn26/en/sujato#19.2), and [MN
    85:43.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn85/en/sujato#43.2).

[^124]: Here "clinging" is *ālaya*, from a root meaning "to
    stick".

[^125]: "Specific conditionality" ( *idappaccayatā*) refers
    to the fact that dependent origination traces the specific
    conditions for other specific things: this conditions that. It is
    not a general principle of universal conditionality ("everything is
    interconnected").

[^126]: "Stilling of all activities"
    (*sabbasaṅkhārasamatho*) is the cessation of all
    conditioned energies or phenomena. \| "Attachments" here is
    *upadhi*, the things of the world to which we cling and which
    bolster our complacency.

[^127]: The commentary is careful to specify that the Buddha means
    physical exhaustion only.

[^128]: "Not supernaturally inspired" (*anacchariyā*)
    rejects the Vedic "channeling" of scripture from the Divinity, while
    "not learned before in the past" (*pubbe assutapubbā*),
    echoing the Dhammacakkappavattanasutta ([SN
    56.11:5.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11/en/sujato#5.1)), rejects
    the oral tradition.

[^129]: "Shrouded" is *āvuṭā*, which is from the same root
    as *asaṁvutā* in [DN
    14:1.17.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#1.17.5) above, as
    well as *nīvaraṇa* ("hindrance"). All these terms
    ultimately stem from the Vedic serpent Vṛtra ("the
    constrictor") who wraps the world in darkness.

[^130]: Had he followed this inclination he would have been a
    *paccekabuddha*, a Buddha "awakened for himself".

[^131]: In the accounts of Gotama's life this is specified as
    Brahmā Sahampati. This whole passage is a moment of
    high cosmic solemnity and drama.

[^132]: The Buddha teaches on the invitation of the highest divinity.
    This sets a precedent for Buddhists to refrain from proselytizing,
    but rather teach by invitation. These passages are still recited in
    some places to invite a teaching.

[^133]: *Aññātāro* is an agent noun in plural, literally
    "understanders".

[^134]: Previously he simply reflected to himself, now he uses his
    psychic abilities to ascertain people's spiritual potential.

[^135]: *Indriya* ("faculty") is an abstract noun from *indra*, the name
    of the potent Vedic god of war. In the Vedas, Indra manifests his
    *indriya* by drinking soma. The drug enables him to release his full
    potential and power; originally this probably referred to drinking
    an amphetamine-like substance before battle. Here we see that it
    means something like "spiritual potential" which is unleashed by the
    practice of the eightfold path.

[^136]: *Pamuñcantu saddhaṁ* has long troubled
    translators, as the basic sense of *pamuñcantu* is
    "release". The problem is a long-standing one, for Sanskrit variants
    include *pramodantu* ("celebrate") or *praṇudantu
    kāṅkṣāḥ* ("dispel doubts"). I think it is a poetic
    variant of *adhimuñcantu*, to "decide" or "commit" to
    faith. Pali commonly uses a synonymous verb to reinforce the sense
    of the noun. In [Snp
    5.19](https://suttacentral.net/snp5.19/en/sujato), *muttasaddho*,
    *pamuñcassu saddhaṁ*, and
    *adhimuttacittaṁ* are all used in this sense.

[^137]: In the account of Gotama, he first thinks to teach his former
    colleagues under whom he practiced the formless attainments. Here we
    see the start of a tendency in the legends of past Buddhas to erase
    the education among other spiritual teachers before awakening. Note
    that these two, who will become Vipassī's chief
    disciples, are leading *khattiya* and brahmin sons of the royal
    household. Khaṇḍa was Vipassī's brother,
    and the priest's son was virtually family.

[^138]: *Khema* ("sanctuary") originally meant "oasis". It is common
    name for lakes and nature parks in the Jātakas.

[^139]: There is a clear distinction between such managed "parks" and
    wilderness regions (*arañña*).

[^140]: In the early period, there was no distinction between "going
    forth" (*pabbajjā*) and "ordination"
    (*upasampadā*). They refer to two sides of the same
    coin: leaving the home life and entering the ascetic life.
    Ordination was originally granted with the simple call, "Come
    mendicant!" (*ehi bhikkhu*).

[^141]: Thus they became arahants, realizing the same truth that
    Vipassī had.

[^142]: As at [Kd
    1:11.1.4](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#11.1.4) and
    [SN 4.5:2.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn4.5/en/sujato#2.3). One of
    the Buddha's first acts is to empower his students.

[^143]: In the Vinaya of the current Buddha, the recitation occurs every
    fortnight on the *uposatha* ("sabbath"), and it includes only the
    mendicants resident in a specific monastery. Here they gathered from
    all over India.

[^144]: "Black Plum Tree Land" is *jambudīpa*, the South
    Asian subcontinent, including India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh,
    and Afghanistan. The number 84,000 does not seem excessive, as the
    Chinese pilgrims recorded many thousands of monasteries throughout
    India. In modern Thailand there are around 40,000 monasteries.

[^145]: The verses that follow form the climax of the whole discourse.
    They are known as the Ovāda Pātimokkha,
    the "monastic code for exhortation". It seems that they were recited
    on the *uposatha* in the days before the establishment of the list
    of rules that is also called *pātimokkha*. Most of the
    extant Vinayas still include these verses in the
    *pātimokkha* texts, the Pali being a notable exception.

[^146]: The Buddha redefines *tapas* from painful mortification to
    gentle acceptance.

[^147]: These verses speak of "Buddhas" in plural.

[^148]: These famous lines serve as a succinct summary of the entire
    Buddhist path.

[^149]: "Embrace" is *upasampadā*, to "enter into". It is
    the same word used for taking ordination as well as entering
    *jhāna*.

[^150]: Through meditation.

[^151]: The *buddhasāsana* ("instruction of the Buddha" or
    "dispensation of the Buddha") is the normal word used by Buddhists
    to refer to their own religion.

[^152]: Here "monastic code" means the principles outlined in these
    verses. They are spelled out in more detail in the Gradual Training
    ([DN 2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato), etc.), and
    ultimately in the detailed legal code of the
    Vinayapiṭaka.

[^153]: The "higher mind" is the four *jhānas* ([AN
    3.90:3.2](https://suttacentral.net/an3.90/en/sujato#3.2)).

[^154]: The Buddha now returns to the present life.
    Ukkaṭṭhā is the home of Pokkharasāti ([DN
    3:2.13.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato#2.13.1)) and the
    site of the astonishing and cosmically significant discourses [MN
    1](https://suttacentral.net/mn1/en/sujato) and [MN
    49](https://suttacentral.net/mn49/en/sujato).

[^155]: Only non-returners are born in the pure abodes
    (*suddhāvāsā*), from where they realize full awakening.

[^156]: "Order of gods" is *devanikāya*. I use "deity" to
    distinguish *devatā* from *deva* but there is no
    substantial difference.

[^157]: This is a list of the major events in any Buddha biography.

[^158]: The lifespan in such a realm can be many hundreds of eons.

[^159]: These are absent in the Pali text at this point, but they are
    mentioned below, and the commentary says they should be included
    here.

[^160]: This is the detailed answer to the question asked by the
    mendicants at [DN
    14:1.13.6](https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#1.13.6).
