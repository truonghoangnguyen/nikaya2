[^397]: [AN 4.198](https://suttacentral.net/an4.198/en/sujato). \| "With
    self become divine" (*brahmabhūtena
    attanā*) deliberately echoes Upaniṣadic
    language. Pali is sometimes said to lack reference to the cosmic
    Brahman (in neuter), having only the personal Brahmā
    (in masculine). The grammatical case of *brahma-* in the compound
    here is undetermined, yet no scholar of Sanskrit would hesitate to
    interpret the common phrase *brahmabhūtātmā* in the
    sense "self become one with the cosmic divinity Brahman". Surely the
    Pali draws from the same sense, using it to describe
    Nibbāna.

[^424]: *Ariyadhana* appears to be constructed after

[^433]: Primarily a Vinaya topic ([Kd

    but also found at [AN

    [MN 104:13.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn104/en/sujato#13.1).

[^434]: This and the next at [AN
    8.80](https://suttacentral.net/an8.80/en/sujato).

[^435]: These are just called "gifts" at [AN
    8.31](https://suttacentral.net/an8.31/en/sujato). The "reasons to
    give" at [AN 8.33](https://suttacentral.net/an8.33/en/sujato) are
    different.

[^436]: See [MN 120:3.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn120/en/sujato#3.4)
    and [AN 8.35:1.8](https://suttacentral.net/an8.35/en/sujato#1.8).

[^437]: "Settled for less" also occurs at [AN
    8.35:1.9](https://suttacentral.net/an8.35/en/sujato#1.9). Readings
    vary between *hīne vimuttaṁ* ("released in
    what is inferior", per MS) and *hīne
    'dhimuttaṁ* ("resolved upon what is inferior"). This is
    an example of an ambiguity between *vi + √muc* ("release") and
    *adhi + √muc* ("resolve") that is sometimes seen in Pali texts. The
    subcommentary reads *vimuttaṁ* and offers two
    explanations: "'Released' (*vimuttaṁ*) means 'resolved'
    (*adhimuttaṁ*); the meaning is slants, slopes, and
    inclines. Or else 'released' means 'set free'
    (*vissaṭṭhaṁ*)." Given that it is clearly accepted in
    the commentarial tradition, and that it is the more difficult
    reading, it seems we must accept *vimuttaṁ* as the
    correct reading here. But from context, and from the subcommentary,
    it has the same sense as *adhimutta*, namely, "resolved upon". This
    goes some way to explaining the ambiguity between the two words, as
    they not only have a similar form, but their meanings can overlap
    too.

[^438]: Notice that they have "seen" the well-to-do brahmins or
    aristocrats, but have only "heard of" the various deities.

[^439]: Previous rebirths required only ethics. Rebirth in the
    Brahmā realm, however, requires the freedom of the mind
    from hindrances through practicing absorption.

    lands beyond the borders are the domain of death.

    and [DN
    34:2.1.122](https://suttacentral.net/dn34/en/sujato#2.1.122); the
    ninth here is made by adding the *asura* rebirth.

[^450]: [AN 9.61](https://suttacentral.net/an9.61/en/sujato).

[^451]: The pre-Buddhist sense of *sati* is "memory", while
    "mindfulness" evolved from the practice of "remembering" scripture,
    creating an uninterrupted flow state in the present. In this sense,
    mindfulness can be understood as the element of continuity that
    knits consciousness together in a coherent stream. Thus when
    practicing "mindfulness of breathing" one pays continuous attention
    to the breaths, not "forgetting" what one is doing.

[^453]: [AN 10.25](https://suttacentral.net/an10.25/en/sujato).
    *Kaṣina* means "universal", "totality", and it refers
    to a measureless state of *jhāna*. In later usage it
    became a term for a physical object, such as a disk, on which a
    meditator focused, but it never has this meaning in early texts.
    Yājñavalkya says that, just as salt is "entirely"
    salty, the Self is an "entire mass of consciousness"
    (*kṛtsnaḥ prajñānaghana eva*,
    Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.5.13).
