[^574]: Ānanda's role became more prominent as a leader of the
    Saṅgha in the years after the Buddha's passing. This
    sutta shows the continued propagation of the Buddha's teachings
    after his death.

[^575]: The same Subha earlier met the Buddha in [MN
    99](https://suttacentral.net/mn99/en/sujato) and again in [MN
    135](https://suttacentral.net/mn135/en/sujato), where he asked about
    kamma. His father Todeyya was a prominent brahmin, often mentioned
    alongside Pokkharasāti. The two apparently lived not
    far from each other, as, according to the commentary, Todeyya was
    named for his village of Tudi outside of Sāvatthī (see
    Pāṇini's Aṣṭādhyāyī 4.3.94). \| These
    events suggest a certain, albeit tenuous, timeframe for the
    significant conversion of influential brahmins initiated by
    Pokkharasāti in [DN
    3](https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato). Here, Subha is active
    after the Buddha's death, suggesting his age is aligned with that of
    Ānanda, a generation younger than the Buddha. If this is so, Subha's
    first meeting with the Buddha would have taken place no earlier than
    the middle period of his teaching, perhaps twenty years before the
    Parinibbāna (MN 99). There he mentions
    Pokkharasāti's hostility to the claims of ascetics, so
    this must precede Pokkharasāti's conversion in DN 3 by
    a considerable period. If we are on the right track, the conversion
    of Pokkharasāti, and the events that flowed from that,
    must have happened late in the Buddha's career, perhaps in the final
    decade of his life.

[^576]: Ānanda was getting old.

[^577]: Cetaka is mentioned only here. The commentary says he was named
    for his home country of Cetī, which is roughly the
    modern region of Bundelkhand, about 500 km south-west of
    Sāvatthī.

[^578]: What follows has much the same content as [DN
    2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato), but arranged under these
    three heads rather than as successively refined happiness.

[^579]: While *samādhi* proper is the deep immersion in
    meditation, here it is a category that pertains to developing such
    states.

[^580]: He had already gone to the Buddha for refuge in [MN
    99:28.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn99/en/sujato#28.4) and [MN
    135:21.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn135/en/sujato#21.4).
