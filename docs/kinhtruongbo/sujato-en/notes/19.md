[^628]: We were introduced to Pañcasikha in [DN
    18](https://suttacentral.net/dn18/en/sujato), which is similar to
    the current sutta in many other details as well. Thus this sutta can
    be considered as a distant cousin to the
    Mahāparinibbāna cycle.

[^629]: The council of gods described by Janavasabha at [DN
    18:12.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn18/en/sujato#12.1), while
    otherwise similar, took place at the entry to a rainy season,
    whereas this one is at the end of a rainy season. This cannot have
    been the Buddha's last rains, for he was already in Vajji by then.

[^630]: For "genuine praise" (*yathābhucce
    vaṇṇe*), see [DN
    1:1.28.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#1.28.1).

[^631]: This set of eight is not found elsewhere. \| "Proffered" is
    *payirudāhāsi*, a unique term in early texts.

[^632]: Sakka adopts the same rhetorical style as
    Sanaṅkumāra ([DN
    18:20.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn18/en/sujato#20.2)).

[^633]: Compare [DN
    18:25.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn18/en/sujato#25.1).

[^634]: *Paṭipadā* is instrumental.

[^635]: I don't think this idea is found elsewhere in quite this way.
    Normally it is said that the path leads to Nibbāna like
    the rivers lead to the ocean (eg. [SN
    45.114:1.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.114/en/sujato#1.1)).

[^636]: This item is unique.

[^637]: Another unique item.

[^638]: This is normally true, but in some cases the Buddha left a
    badly-behaved community ([MN
    48](https://suttacentral.net/mn48/en/sujato)), dismissed misbehaving
    monks (eg. [AN
    8.10:2.2](https://suttacentral.net/an8.10/en/sujato#2.2)), or even
    dismissed a large community ([MN
    67](https://suttacentral.net/mn67/en/sujato)). \| The "joy of
    solitude" is *ekārāmataṁ* .

[^639]: Also at [DN
    29:29.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato#29.5), [AN
    4.23:4.1](https://suttacentral.net/an4.23/en/sujato#4.1), and [Iti
    112:5.1](https://suttacentral.net/iti112/en/sujato#5.1).

[^640]: *Pariyositasaṅkappo* ("achieved all he wished for")
    is a synonym of the more common *paripuṇṇasaṅkappo*
    (eg. [MN 29:2.5](https://suttacentral.net/mn29/en/sujato#2.5)).

[^641]: This impossibility is also at [AN
    1.277:1.1](https://suttacentral.net/an1.277/en/sujato#1.1) and [MN
    115:14.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn115/en/sujato#14.1). \| "In one
    solar system" (*ekissā lokadhātuyā*): a
    single *lokadhātu* encompasses a single terrestrial
    world with a single moon and sun.

[^642]: It is not common to wish for the Buddha's long life, but we do
    find this sentiment expressed in a conversation between
    Sāriputta and Ānanda ([SN
    21.2:3.5](https://suttacentral.net/sn21.2/en/sujato#3.5)).

[^643]: "Having appraised" (*saṅkhāya*) is glossed by the
    commentary with "having known" (*jānitvā*). Compare the
    discussion on "judgmentalism" at [DN
    1:1.3.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#1.3.1).

[^644]: Disampati means "head of the directions", i.e. king of all the
    land. He and his story are found nowhere else in the early texts.

[^645]: "Steward" is Govinda, literally "lord of cows". The "high
    priest" (*purohita*) was a hereditary office, a learned ritualist
    and adviser attached to a specific family. For royal families the
    post could be highly contested. The closeness of the role is shown
    in that aristocratic families could be referred to by the lineage of
    the high priest.

[^646]: While the current sutta does not explicitly identify their
    realm, Dīpavaṁsa iii 40 records Disampati and
    Reṇu as kings of Kāsi. This fits with the
    geographical layout depicted in this sutta, with Kāsi
    at the center. The story, then, depicts the establishment of
    Brahmanical kings across India from Kāsi.

[^647]: Jotipāla means "guardian of the sacred flame", i.e.
    someone who maintains the Vedic fire ritual (see below at [DN
    19:47.26](https://suttacentral.net/dn19/en/sujato#47.26)). There was
    another Jotipāla in the time of Buddha Kassapa at [MN
    81:6.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn81/en/sujato#6.2), and another
    who was a religious founder of the past ([AN
    6.54:18.1](https://suttacentral.net/an6.54/en/sujato#18.1), [AN
    7.73:2.5](https://suttacentral.net/an7.73/en/sujato#2.5)). Despite
    the popularity of the name in Pali, it does not seem to appear in
    Sanskrit sources. Given that it appears in Pali only in legendary
    contexts, it is probably a vocational epithet.

[^648]: The king's only care, it seems, is not for the passing of his
    friend, but that he no longer gets to indulge in whatever he wants.

[^649]: This shows that Govinda is an office rather than a personal
    name.

[^650]: Following the Mahāsaṅgīti reading rather than the
    PTS (*nānusāsi ... nānusāsati*). It seems
    required by the context that he does more than his father.

[^651]: Following PTS reading *sukhaṁ
    edheyyātha*.

[^652]: The meaning of *sakaṭamukhaṁ* ("front of a cart")
    is clarified by comparison with the parallels. T 8 is identical (),
    while DA 3 expresses a similar idea more briefly (). The
    Mahāvastu (Mvu 85.17) confirms this sense with
    *dakṣiṇena saṁkṣiptā
    śakaṭamukhasaṁsthitaṁ*. These appear to demonstrate a
    knowledge of the shape of the Indian subcontinent. Below it says
    that each of the kingdoms is shaped like the front of a cart, just
    as India is as a whole.

[^653]: Neither Rhys Davids nor Walshe translate this line, but it
    receives an extensive discussion in the commentary. It says that six
    kingdoms were arranged around Reṇu's kingdom in the
    middle, like an umbrella (*vitānasadisaṁ*).

[^654]: The verses tell the realms starting with the rising sun at
    Kaliṅga in the east and proceeding clockwise
    (*padakkhiṇā*) until the circle is complete with
    Aṅga on the Kaliṅga border. Thus the
    original center was probably the last place on the list,
    Kāsi, which is indeed geographically central.

[^655]: Kaliṅga was a coastal realm in modern Odisha and
    Andhra Pradesh. There is no consensus on the exact location of
    Dantapura.

[^656]: Assaka stretched from Kaliṅga's western border
    across the interior. Potana is modern Bodhan in Telangana state.

[^657]: *Mahesaya* of the Pali editions is a variant spelling for
    *māhissatī*; Mahāvastu has
    *māhiṣmatī*. It is in present-day Madhya Pradesh, on
    the banks of Narmada River, and is perhaps to be identified with
    modern Maheshwar.

[^658]: Sovīra was on the lower Indus, and Roruka is
    identified with modern Rohri in Sindh province, Pakistan. It is
    implausible that they received Aryan culture from Kāsi.

[^659]: Mithilā was the capital of Videha, to the north
    east of the Vajjian federation, nestled against the Himalayas.
    Mithilā was a dominant kingdom before the Buddha, its
    king Janaka featuring prominently in early Upaniṣads.
    It features rarely in the suttas ([MN
    91](https://suttacentral.net/mn91/en/sujato), [Thig
    6.2](https://suttacentral.net/thig6.2/en/sujato), [Thig
    13.4](https://suttacentral.net/thig13.4/en/sujato)) and had
    apparently declined in importance. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
    1.4.1.10--19 depicts its origins in terms of the spread of
    fire-worship from the west by its founding king Māthava
    Videgha with his priest Gotama Rāhūgaṇa.

[^660]: Campā is modern Champapuri near Bhagalpur in Bihar
    state, not far from West Bengal. Aṅga lay between the
    Chandan river to the west and the Rajmahal hills to the east. In the
    centuries before the Buddha it expanded its dominion to the sea on
    the south-east and Magadha in the west. But with the
    Kaliṅgas pushing back from the coast and the rise of
    Bimbisāra in Magadha, they were pushed back to their
    ancestral lands and fell under Magadhan dominion.

[^661]: Varanasi, one of the oldest cities in the world, was the capital
    of the Kāsī kingdom. It lost its status as an
    independent kingdom shortly before the Buddha, when it was taken
    over by Kosala. It appears in countless Buddhist stories of the past
    as the dominant city of the region in what appears to be a timeless
    and ageless past. However, despite its great antiquity, it is a
    historical settlement, of which the discovered remains date back to
    perhaps 1200 BCE; it was a capital city from perhaps 800 BCE.

[^662]: The names of the aristocrat kings---most of which are difficult
    to identify from other sources---are listed in an abruptly-inserted
    verse. The names are missing from the parallels in
    Mahāvastu and DA 3, but T 8 appears to have the same
    list of names in the same order, except with Reṇu at
    the start. Rhys Davids proposes to assign each one to a kingdom as
    listed in the same order. This seems to work for the first four
    names, as [Ja 424](https://suttacentral.net/ja424/en/sujato),
    invoking this sutta, identifies Bharata as king of
    Sovīra. But it falls apart with Reṇu, who
    as we have seen, belongs in Kāsi rather than Videha.

[^663]: "Bharata" is the name of an individual king, while they are
    collectively known as "Bhāratas" (with a long initial
    *ā* due to secondary derivation). [Ja
    424](https://suttacentral.net/ja424/en/sujato), invoking this sutta,
    identifies Bharata as king of Sovīra.

[^664]: Here *bhāratā* means "kings of India" or perhaps,
    if read together with the preceding verses, "kingdoms of India".
    India was called Bhārata after the legendary King
    Bharata of Hastināpura (Delhi), founder of the Lunar
    dynasty, conqueror of India, and sire of the warring tribes of the
    Mahābharata. His story is told in the
    Saṁbhavapara of the Mahābhārata. The name
    represents the success of Vedic culture across the subcontinent.

[^665]: In spiritual circles, such rumors spread like wildfire in an
    Australian summer.

[^666]: The ancient Brahmanical teachers are invoked to justify the
    Buddhist rains retreat. \| Compassion is one of the "meditations of
    Brahmā" (*brahmavihāra*). Normally the
    suttas speak of the absorptions (*jhāna*) and of the
    meditation on compassion (*karuṇā*), but the idea of an
    "absorption on compassion" is unique to this sutta.

[^667]: Compare [MN
    51:10.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn51/en/sujato#10.3), where the
    same construction is a site for the sacrifice.

[^668]: "Deathless" from a Brahmanical perspective, but very much within
    the realm of *saṁsāra* from a Buddhist perspective.

[^669]: *Brahme* is the normal vocative for *brahmā*.
    However in verse it is sometimes used as vocative for
    *brāhmaṇa* (eg. [Snp
    5.1:7.3](https://suttacentral.net/snp5.1/en/sujato#7.3), [Snp
    5.19:3.4](https://suttacentral.net/snp5.19/en/sujato#3.4)).

[^670]: These factors are explained as a summary of the Gradual
    Training.

[^671]: "At one" (*ekodibhūta* or more commonly
    *ekodibhāva*) normally describes deep meditation, and
    is part of the formula for the second *jhāna*. Here it
    is explained as equivalent to "seclusion" (*viveka*).

[^672]: "Putrefaction" (*āmagandha*) is the smell of
    (moral) decay or corruption ([AN
    3.128](https://suttacentral.net/an3.128/en/sujato), [Snp
    2.2](https://suttacentral.net/snp2.2/en/sujato)).

[^673]: "Desire" is (*icchā*). PTS reads
    *vicikicchā* ("doubt"), but this must be incorrect as
    the commentary explains it as "craving" (*taṇhā*).

[^674]: "Easy to quell" (*sunimmadaya*) is unique to this passage.

[^675]: As noted in the comment to [DN
    16:5.19.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#5.19.2), kingly
    clans adopted the lineage name of the high priest (*purohita*)
    during initiation.

[^676]: "True teaching" (*saddhamma*) normally describes the Buddha's
    teaching.

[^677]: "Leads to rebirth in the Brahmā realm"
    (*brahmalokūpapattiyā*), just as the teaching of
    Āḷāra Kālāma, based on the even more
    refined formless meditations, leads to rebirth in the dimension of
    nothingness ([MN
    36:14.14](https://suttacentral.net/mn36/en/sujato#14.14)).

[^678]: Echoing the ancient hermit Araka at [AN
    7.74:2.2](https://suttacentral.net/an7.74/en/sujato#2.2), who said
    life is evanescent like a dewdrop.

[^679]: It is regarded as normal that woman should renounce.

[^680]: Compare with the mass renunciation under Vipassī
    ([DN 14:2.16.6](https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#2.16.6)).

[^681]: His meditation expands from compassion to include all four of
    the *brahmavihāras*.

[^682]: This is the third and final Jātaka in the
    Dīghanikāya, after [DN
    5](https://suttacentral.net/dn5/en/sujato) and [DN
    17](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato).

[^683]: According to the doctrine of the "perfections"
    (*pāramī*), which emerged around two to four centuries
    after the Buddha's passing, the practices he undertook in past lives
    laid the foundation for awakening in this life. Here, however, the
    Buddha states that his former practices did not lead to awakening.
    Rather, since they were based on the wrong view of eternal bliss in
    the Brahmā realm, they only led to a good rebirth so
    long as that kamma lasted. It is the eightfold path, which the
    Buddha discovered in his final life, which leads to awakening. The
    same saying in a similar context is found at [MN
    83:21.7](https://suttacentral.net/mn83/en/sujato#21.7).
