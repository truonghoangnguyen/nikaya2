[^241]: The longest of all early discourses, this dramatic and moving
    narrative tells the story of the Buddha's slow journey towards his
    final passing.

[^242]: After the events of [DN
    2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato), Ajātasattu
    retained and consolidated his power. Magadha ultimately conquered
    the Vajji Federation and continued to expand until almost all of
    India was under its sway.

[^243]: According to the commentary, Ajātasattu's anger was
    rooted in a dispute on trade routes. Control of shipping on the
    Ganges was essential for establishing international trade. There was
    a port on the Ganges extending over a league, split half and half
    between Magadha and Vajji. Valuable products were sourced from a
    mountain and brought down for trade, but the Vajjis kept absconding
    with the whole lot. The place is not identified, but Munger, a
    strategic port east of Patna, fits the description. The nearby hills
    have been mined since paleolithic times. It is also likely, as
    maintained in Jain tradition, that the Vajjis disputed
    Ajātasattu's accession after committing regicide. His
    threatening posture towards the Vajjis is also mentioned in [SN
    20.8:2.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn20.8/en/sujato#2.2).

[^244]: Vassakāra appears in the suttas as a devoted
    follower of the Buddha.

[^245]: The Vajji Federation harks back to an early settlement founded
    by the legendary Nābhānediṣṭha in the Vedic period. It
    built its wealth on its extensive fertile plains and the trading
    possibilities opened up by the Gandak and Ganges rivers.

[^246]: While it may seem strange to consult the Buddha on such a
    violent plan, Ajātasattu knows from his experience in
    DN 2 that the Buddha will not hesitate to tell him the truth, even
    if it is bad news. It seems he is trying to avoid the downfall of
    tyrants who are surrounded only with yes men.

[^247]: Reading *yojapetvā* ("had them harnessed"), which
    is found in the Mahāsaṅgīti in similar passages, and in
    this passage in the PTS edition.

[^248]: Ānanda cares for the Buddha in his old age. Shortly after these
    events, Ānanda was entrusted with reciting the suttas at the First
    Council. This discourse would have been composed by him in the years
    following his Master's death. More than a simple interlocutor,
    Ānanda shapes the story as its second lead, a relatable character
    with an empathetic point of view. He imbues the discourse with his
    emotional struggles as he deals with the Buddha's passing and helps
    ensure the future survival of the Dhamma, while still developing his
    own meditation practice.

[^249]: As for example at [AN
    8.12:1.2](https://suttacentral.net/an8.12/en/sujato#1.2).

[^250]: Harmony is especially important as the Vajji Federation was
    comprised of several different clans, among them the Licchavis of
    Vesālī, the Ñātikas just south of
    Vesālī, the Uggas of Hatthigāma (Elephant
    Village), and the Bhogas of Bhoganagara. Some sources say the Vajjis
    proper were another tribe within the alliance. The Videhans of
    Mithilā are also sometimes included, but several
    sources indicate that they remained an independent, if reduced,
    kingdom until they were conquered by Magadha some years later. The
    Mallas of Pāvā and Kusinārā formed a
    closely allied independent republic ([MN
    35:12.8](https://suttacentral.net/mn35/en/sujato#12.8)).

[^251]: The "ancient Vajjian traditions" (*porāṇe
    vajjidhamme*) would have been established with the founding of the
    Vajji Federation some centuries earlier, which ensured that the
    members of the federation would have a voice in the
    Licchavi-dominated union. Compare with the "ancient traditions of
    the brahmins" (*porāṇā brāhmaṇadhammā* at
    [AN 5.191](https://suttacentral.net/an5.191/en/sujato) and [Snp
    2.7](https://suttacentral.net/snp2.7/en/sujato)), the falling away
    from which is said to be the cause of Brahmanical decline.
    Similarly, the Buddha elsewhere scolds the Vajjis for their
    indulgence ([AN 5.143](https://suttacentral.net/an5.143/en/sujato)),
    suggesting that the decline may have already set in.

[^252]: This advocates for legal protection for women from sexual
    violence. \| For various legal regulations regarding women and sex,
    see Kauṭilya's Arthaśāstra 12.

[^253]: The Buddha will stay at several of these shrines later in this
    discourse. They were sacred groves, maintained by the people in
    reverence for the powerful spirits of nature. \| "Spirit-offerings"
    is *bali*. \| The commentary explains "inner or outer" as inside or
    outside the town.

[^254]: It is an old Indian belief that the presence of holy persons
    provides a kind of umbrella effect that protects the realm.

[^255]: This event is recorded at [AN
    7.21](https://suttacentral.net/an7.21/en/sujato), where the Buddha
    addresses the Licchavis. That chapter of the Aṅguttara
    mostly consists of the teachings found here presented as separate
    suttas. \| The Sārandada shrine was short walk from
    Vesālī ([AN
    5.143](https://suttacentral.net/an5.143/en/sujato)).

[^256]: There is a certain tension here: the Buddha taught these
    principles to the Vajjis, one of which is that the Vajjis should not
    adopt new decrees. It seems that a "decree"
    (*paññatta*) is more like constitutional law, whereas a
    "principle" (*dhamma*) is more like a behavioral guideline.

[^257]: *Upalāpana* is used a number of times in the
    Vinaya, where it always has the sense of giving someone something to
    get them to do what you want. It has the same sense at [SN
    3.25:4.13](https://suttacentral.net/sn3.25/en/sujato#4.13), where an
    enemy king may be bribed with gold from the royal treasury. \| The
    commentary says that Vassakāra himself was assigned
    with the task of weakening the Vajjis in this way.

[^258]: There were several monasteries and hermitages around
    Rājagaha ([Kd
    2:11.1.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/sujato#11.1.1)).

[^259]: Also at [AN 7.23](https://suttacentral.net/an7.23/en/sujato).

[^260]: This especially refers to the fortnightly *uposatha*. Despite
    the dangers faced in the rugged hills around Rājagaha
    ([Kd
    2:12.1.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/sujato#12.1.1)),
    the Buddha insisted that all monks of the locality attended the
    *uposatha* ([Kd
    2:5.3.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/sujato#5.3.1)).

[^261]: The Buddha encouraged the mendicants to recite the Dhamma in
    harmony ([MN
    103:3.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn103/en/sujato#3.2)), to resolve
    issues in harmony ([MN
    104:14.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn104/en/sujato#14.3)), and on
    the *uposatha* to recite and train in the *pātimokkha*
    in harmony ([Bu As
    7:4.11](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-as7/en/sujato#4.11)).

[^262]: Picking up from the similar injunction to the Vajjis, this kicks
    off a long narrative arc that binds together the Buddha's invitation
    to abolish the minor rules ([DN
    16:6.3.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#6.3.1)) with the
    bad monk Subhadda's seizing on the Buddha's death as an excuse to
    give up the rules, which was the direct motivation for the First
    Council ([DN
    16:6.20.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#6.20.3) = [Kd
    21:1.1.24](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd21/en/sujato#1.1.24)),
    at the end of which the Sangha agreed not to abolish any rules ([Kd
    21:1.9.20](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd21/en/sujato#1.9.20)),
    a decision that was affirmed a century later at the Second Council
    ([Kd 22](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd22/en/sujato)).

[^263]: The nature of seniority in the Saṅgha is often
    misunderstood. There is no "hierarchy" (literally "rule of priests")
    in the sense of power-based relationships: no monastic has the
    authority to command another monk or nun. Seniority is owed respect,
    not obedience.

[^264]: This stands in place of the injunction against sexual violence,
    both principles being concerned with the harmful effects of desire.

[^265]: This stands in place of the injunction to maintain the shrines,
    where mendicants would frequently stay.

[^266]: This stands in place of the injunction to look after arahants.

[^267]: Also at [AN 7.24](https://suttacentral.net/an7.24/en/sujato).

[^268]: "Work" is *kamma*, which especially means "building work". Of
    course it is essential to do work, but one should not get too caught
    up in it. The Buddha did not believe that working hard was ennobling
    in and of itself.

[^269]: "Corrupt wishes" (*pāpicchā*) is defined as when a
    faithless person wishes to be known as faithful, or person otherwise
    lacking good qualities wishes to be known as having them ([AN
    10.23:6.2](https://suttacentral.net/an10.23/en/sujato#6.2)).

[^270]: This item and the preceding two were the downfall of Devadatta
    ([Iti 89](https://suttacentral.net/iti89/en/sujato)).

[^271]: Also at [AN 7.25](https://suttacentral.net/an7.25/en/sujato).

[^272]: Also at [AN 7.26](https://suttacentral.net/an7.26/en/sujato).

[^273]: As at [AN 7.27](https://suttacentral.net/an7.27/en/sujato).
    These "perceptions" are all meditation practices which are described
    at [AN 10.60](https://suttacentral.net/an10.60/en/sujato).

[^274]: These six principles are found in several places, but they are
    not elsewhere called "principles that prevent decline"; for example
    at [AN 6.11](https://suttacentral.net/an6.11/en/sujato) they are
    called "warm-hearted qualities" (*dhammā
    sāraṇīyā*). At [AN
    6.22](https://suttacentral.net/an6.22/en/sujato), however, a
    different six qualities are called "principles that prevent
    decline": not relishing work, talk, sleep, and company, being easy
    to admonish, and having good friends.

[^275]: This is the right view of the noble eightfold path, in other
    words, the four noble truths.

[^276]: This epitome of the Dhamma is repeated eight times in this
    discourse, summarizing the teachings in the Gradual Training. It is
    not found in this exact form elsewhere.

[^277]: "Imbued" (*paribhāvita*) as a mother hen imbues her
    eggs with warmth by sitting on them ([AN
    7.71:2.2](https://suttacentral.net/an7.71/en/sujato#2.2)). See also
    [SN 55.21:2.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn55.21/en/sujato#2.3).

[^278]: Some editions add *diṭṭhāsava* ("defilement of
    views"), but since that appears to be a late interpolation I follow
    the Mahāsaṅgīti in omitting it.

[^279]: This is the same rest-house at which the Buddha sojourned on his
    way from Rājagaha to Nāḷandā in the
    Brahmajālasutta ([DN
    1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato)).

[^280]: This was apparently the last time that the Buddha met
    Sāriputta. This encounter is recorded in an independent
    sutta at [SN 47.12](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.12/en/sujato) and
    expanded into a long discourse at [DN
    28](https://suttacentral.net/dn28/en/sujato). The
    Saṁyutta follows this meeting with the record of
    Sāriputta's passing at [SN
    47.13](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.13/en/sujato), and then the
    lament for the absence of both Sāriputta and
    Moggallāna at [SN 47.14
    ](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.14 /en/sujato). For some reason
    these events were omitted from the present discourse, even though
    they fit well thematically.

[^281]: As at [DN
    14:1.37.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#1.37.4),
    inference (*anvaya*) is regarded as a valid form of knowledge. The
    Buddha himself is said to rely on inference using the same simile at
    [AN 10.95:10.4](https://suttacentral.net/an10.95/en/sujato#10.4).

[^282]: This is modern Patna. In this account we see how it was
    developed from the simple riverside village of
    Pāṭaligāma to the citadel of Pāṭaliputta.
    Ajātasattu ultimately moved the capital of Magadha from
    the defensively-postured Rājagaha surrounded by hills
    to this trading center on open waters. Under Ashoka it became one of
    the greatest cities of the ancient world. It was named after the
    *pāṭalī* tree (*Stereospermum chelonoides*), known as
    *patala* in Hindi.

[^283]: Also at [AN 5.213](https://suttacentral.net/an5.213/en/sujato),
    [Ud 8.6:4.1](https://suttacentral.net/ud8.6/en/sujato#4.1), [DN
    33:2.1.36](https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#2.1.36), and [Kd
    1:28.4.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#28.4.1).

[^284]: The Buddha begins with the things most obvious and pertinent to
    the audience.

[^285]: Bewildered by fear and regret.

[^286]: *Suññāgāra* normally means an "empty dwelling", but
    here the commentary describes it as a curtained-off cubicle.

[^287]: Vassakāra was no dawdler, as he preceded the Buddha
    to Pāṭaligāma. And not long after, he returned to
    Rājagaha to build more fortifications there ([MN
    108:6.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn108/en/sujato#6.2)). \| *Nagara*
    here means "citadel, fortress", not "city". It has the same sense as
    *pura*. The construction is defensive and may well have begun before
    Ajātasattu began thinking of invading.

[^288]: The relation between deities and building sites (*vatthu*)
    appears only in this passage in the early texts (repeated at [Ud
    8.6:15.2](https://suttacentral.net/ud8.6/en/sujato#15.2) and [Kd
    1:28.7.3](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#28.7.3)).
    Divination and geomancy (*vatthuvijjā*) for building
    sites is said to be a wrong livelihood at [DN
    1:1.21.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#1.21.2).

[^289]: From this point, later texts always refer to
    Pāṭaliputta, but the reason for the change of name from
    Pāṭaligāma is not explained in the commentary. *Putta*
    is a suffix indicating the people of a certain clan or place, so
    *pāṭaliputta* means "a person from Pāṭalī
    (village)" or as we might say, "Pāṭalian". As the city
    became well known and its identity as a village receded, it must
    have become known as the "city of the Pāṭaliputtas" and
    hence simply Pāṭaliputta. Compare the uses of
    *ñātika* below. \| The commentary explains that
    *puṭabhedanaṁ* refers to the "opening of packages",
    signifying that it was a center of trade. This usage is attested as
    late as the 13th century Jain Vividhatīrthakalpa of
    Jinaprabhasūri.

[^290]: Excavations reveal that Pāṭaliputta was constructed
    of wood, so the danger of fire was real. It is situated on a
    low-lying flood plain of the Ganges, so flooding would also have
    been an obvious danger. As for dissension (*mithubheda*),
    Vassakāra had indicated that this was a means of
    bringing down the Vajjis, so it would seem that kamma was lying in
    wait for them.

[^291]: This is the *anumodanā* recited for the meal
    offering. Other examples are found at [Snp
    3.7:34.3](https://suttacentral.net/snp3.7/en/sujato#34.3) = [MN
    92:25.6](https://suttacentral.net/mn92/en/sujato#25.6), [SN
    55.26:20.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn55.26/en/sujato#20.1), [Kd
    1:15.14.4](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#15.14.4),
    and [Kd
    1:1.5.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#1.5.1). \| It
    is worth noting that no early *anomodanā* uses the
    imperative verb form *-tu* signifying giving a blessing (eg.
    *bhavatu sabbamaṅgalaṁ*, "may all blessings be"). They
    strictly use the indicative *-ti* to teach cause and effect: if you
    do this, that happens.

[^292]: Buddhism promotes good neighborliness with all beings, seen and
    unseen. Making an offering to the local spirits helps create a
    positive and healthy sense of place.

[^293]: At [AN 4.67:8.3](https://suttacentral.net/an4.67/en/sujato#8.3)
    a similar sentiment is expressed for animals.

[^294]: The "ford" (*tittha*) is symbolic; those who forge a path to
    salvation are called *titthakara*, such as the six leading ascetics
    of [DN 2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato). Today there is a
    5.7 km bridge at this crossing, which is appropriately called the
    Mahatma Gandhi Setu.

[^295]: "Dinghy" translates *uḷumpa*.

[^296]: In this stock phrase, we sometimes find
    *paccuṭṭhāsi* ("landed") and sometimes
    *pāturahosi* ("reappeared").

[^297]: *Aṇṇavaṁ* cannot mean "sea" here, since it is to be
    crossed with a bridge.

[^298]: Koṭigāma lay a short distance from the Ganges. The
    Buddha's stay here must therefore have followed the events of [SN
    47.14](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.14/en/sujato) at
    Ukkacelā on the Vajjian bank of the Ganges, where he
    laments the passing of Sāriputta and
    Moggallāna. He would have heard of
    Sāriputta's passing before then, while on the road from
    Nāḷandā to Pāṭaligāma, even though that is
    implausibly said to have happened at Sāvatthī ([SN
    47.13](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.13/en/sujato)).

[^299]: Also at [SN 56.21](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.21/en/sujato).

[^300]: Ñātika (also spelled *nātika*, or
    *nādika*; Sanskrit *jñātṛka*;
    Prākrit *nāyika*) was the clan to which
    the Jain leader Mahāvīra (called
    Nāṭaputta, i.e. Ñātiputta) belonged. Here
    it is unusually spelled in plural, which means "the land of the
    Ñātika clan".

[^301]: Here Ñātika is in singular and appears to be the
    name of a town. Thus Ñātika is first of all a name of a
    clan, then the land they live in, then their chief town. \| Over a
    millennium previously, the Indus Valley Civilization had built
    cities of fired brick with standardized size and construction
    methods, but in the Buddha's day most buildings were wood. This is
    the only brick building mentioned in the suttas; brick construction
    is also discussed in the Vinaya.

[^302]: It is unprecedented to discuss the spiritual destinies of an
    entire town like this. Normally this question is only asked when
    specific individuals known to the Buddha have passed away. Likely
    the passage was created in the wake of the passing of
    Mahāvīra to show that even his own people were
    enthusiastic Buddhists. This portion of the text is also found at
    [SN 55.8](https://suttacentral.net/sn55.8/en/sujato).

[^303]: [SN 55.9](https://suttacentral.net/sn55.9/en/sujato) inserts
    another series on a monk, nun, layman, and laywoman all called
    Asoka.

[^304]: This portion of the text is at [SN
    55.10](https://suttacentral.net/sn55.10/en/sujato). I spell names
    consistently with there.

[^305]: The suttas consistently depict lay folk as attaining the third
    stage of awakening, non-return, but not the highest stage of
    arahantship, except in rare cases on the deathbed. The tradition
    extended this by saying that if a lay person becomes an arahant,
    they must ordain or die that day, but this is not supported in the
    early texts. The point is not whether you receive an ordination, but
    whether you let go of attachments.

[^306]: The commentary to the Saṁyutta attributes the large
    number of deaths to a recent plague (*ahivātaroga*,
    "viper's breath disease"). This deadly contagion was known to kill
    off entire families ([Kd
    1:50.1.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#50.1.1)).
    According to the commentaries, the same disease once afflicted
    Vesālī, prompting the teaching of the Ratanasutta ([Snp
    2.1](https://suttacentral.net/snp2.1/en/sujato), [Kp
    6](https://suttacentral.net/kp6/en/sujato)).

[^307]: Mirrors are for doing makeup ([DN
    1:1.16.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#1.16.2)) or
    admiring oneself ([MN
    77:33.18](https://suttacentral.net/mn77/en/sujato#33.18)), which a
    mendicant should not do ([Kd
    15:2.4.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/sujato#2.4.1)). In
    the Dhamma a mirror is for self-reflection ([MN
    61:8.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn61/en/sujato#8.2)), while the
    mind is purified like polishing a mirror ([AN
    3.70:13.4](https://suttacentral.net/an3.70/en/sujato#13.4)).

[^308]: The four principles that follow are elsewhere identified as four
    factors of stream-entry ([AN
    9.27](https://suttacentral.net/an9.27/en/sujato)). At [SN
    12.41](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.41/en/sujato), understanding of
    dependent origination is included.

[^309]: "Experiential" is *avecca*, literally "having undergone".
    "Experiential confidence" is the faith of a stream-enterer, who has
    seen for themselves.

[^310]: They have experiential confidence in the Buddha as a teacher
    because they have followed his path and realized the results that he
    speaks of.

[^311]: A stream-enterer has direct experience of the four noble truths,
    so they have confirmed that the teaching is indeed realizable in
    this very life.

[^312]: The suttas distinguish between two senses of
    Saṅgha. The "mendicant Saṅgha"
    (*bhikkhusaṅgha*) is the conventional community of
    monks and nuns. The "Saṅgha of disciples"
    (*sāvakasaṅgha*) is classified as fourfold according to
    the stages of awakening: stream-entry, once-return, non-return, and
    perfection. Each of these stages is further subdivided into those of
    the path who are practicing for realization and those of the fruit
    who have realized. These are referred to as "noble disciples", four
    of the path and four of the fruit, making eight individuals in
    total.

[^313]: This entails keeping the five precepts at a minimum.

[^314]: Ambapālī means "protector of mangoes". Here the
    text just says she had a "grove", but it is identified as a mango
    grove below ([DN
    16:2.14.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#2.14.1)).

[^315]: In some versions, the Buddha is said to have taught the monks
    mindfulness in anticipation of the arrival of the beautiful
    courtesan.

[^316]: In the Gradual Training the mendicant "establishes mindfulness"
    to begin meditation. Here this practice is expanded, and in [DN
    22](https://suttacentral.net/dn22/en/sujato) it is expanded even
    further.

[^317]: The locative idiom *kāye kāyānupassī*
    indicates that the meditator focuses on a particular aspect of body
    contemplation, such as observing the breath, awareness of the body
    parts, or reflection on the four elements. \| "Rid of desire and
    aversion for the world" refers to clearing the mind through the
    previous practice of sense restraint.

[^318]: *Dhammā* here refers to the "principles" of cause
    and effect and the four noble truths which are understood by
    reflecting on the psychology of meditation itself. In this context
    *dhammā* does not mean "mental objects" or "phenomena"
    or "mental qualities".

[^319]: A *gaṇikā* was a trained entertainer and escort
    whose company commanded a high fee ([Kd
    8:1.1.7](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/sujato#1.1.7)). It
    was a respected position, as we see the city guild of
    Rājagaha, with King Bimbisāra's blessing,
    appoint the young woman Sālavatī in a similar position
    ([Kd
    8:1.2.13](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/sujato#1.2.13)).

[^320]: The text spends more time on the Vajjis' appearance than on
    Ambapālī's. At [Thig
    15.1:12.1](https://suttacentral.net/thig15.1/en/sujato#12.1) the nun
    Isidāsī recalls how she used to do the makeup for her
    husband every day, like his own personal beautician.

[^321]: There are various reading for *paṭivaṭṭesi*. The
    commentary glosses with *pahari* ("struck, collided").

[^322]: The derogatory indeclinable vocative *je* is otherwise used of
    the "naughty maid" Kāḷī at [MN
    21:9.13](https://suttacentral.net/mn21/en/sujato#9.13). "Wench" is a
    term meant to insult on the basis of servitude or promiscuity, so it
    seems appropriate. The Licchavis are not distinguishing themselves
    here; given their youth, wealth, licentiousness, and evident
    familiarity with Ambapālī, it seems safe to conclude
    that they had been her clients.

[^323]: *Dassatha* is second future plural of *dadāti*. The
    Vinaya parallel at [Kd
    6:30.4.5](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/sujato#30.4.5) uses
    optative forms instead. \| "With provinces" is
    *sāhāraṁ* (literally "with food", commentary:
    *sajanapadaṁ*) refers to the holdings around the city
    that supplied food and other necessities.

[^324]: Despite the context, *ambakā* has no etymological
    relation to *amba* ("mango") but is a term for "woman, mother", used
    here as a play on words.

[^325]: This demonstrates that a woman of Ambapālī's
    profession could own land and control significant resources.

[^326]: An *ārāma* is a tended and pleasant ground, a
    "park". Here it has previously been referred to as "grove" (*vana*)
    and "mango grove". Usually in the suttas, however, it is a name for
    a place where monastics live. In English, monastics don't live in
    parks, they live in monasteries. So once a place has been dedicated
    for the Saṅgha, I translate *ārāma* as
    "monastery".

[^327]: Pali texts waver between *beluva* ("wood-apple") and
    *veḷuva* (from *veḷuvant*, "full of
    bamboo").

[^328]: The Buddha was travelling with a large retinue, which could
    become burdensome on a small village if they were to stay the three
    months of the rains residence. The texts note several monasteries
    and places to stay around Vesālī.

[^329]: Here *upaṭṭhāka* refers to the lay devotees. \|
    *Apaloketi* ("take leave") also has a literal sense of "glance
    back"; both senses are found in the sutta (see [DN
    16:4.1.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#4.1.2)).

[^330]: "Life force" is *jīvitasaṅkhāra* whereas below we
    find *āyusaṅkhāra* ([DN
    16:3.10.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#3.10.1)). They
    are evidently synonyms; [Ps
    1.6:4.3](https://suttacentral.net/ps1.6/en/sujato#4.3) refers to the
    three *jīvitasaṅkhāras* from [MN
    43:24.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn43/en/sujato#24.2), but there
    the text has *āyusaṅkhāra*. *Saṅkhāra*
    could be interpreted here either as "volition" ("will to live") or
    as "life force" (i.e. the vital energy that sustains life).
    Elsewhere, however, *āyusaṅkhāra* clearly means "life
    force" ([SN
    20.6:3.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn20.6/en/sujato#3.2), [MN
    43:23.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn43/en/sujato#23.1)).

[^331]: This is the first indication of Ānanda's fragile emotional state
    in the days to come. \| Read *diṭṭhā* (= Sanskrit
    *diṣṭyā*), "fantastic, how fortunate", per [DN
    26:21.9](https://suttacentral.net/dn26/en/sujato#21.9) and [Ja
    81:1.4](https://suttacentral.net/ja81/en/sujato#1.4).

[^332]: Previously the Buddha had spoken of "taking leave" of the
    Saṅgha, but here something more specific is meant.
    *Udāharati* is typically used when a
    previously-mentioned matter (often unpleasant) is "brought up", as
    at the monastic procedures for confession or invitation to admonish
    ([Kd
    1:16.2.5](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#16.2.5), [Kd
    1:2.1.9](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#2.1.9)).
    Ānanda is implying that there is some unfinished disciplinary
    business that needs attention. Despite the Buddha's response, he did
    in fact go on to make a number of statements and rulings.

[^333]: For forty-five years he had been teaching and supporting the
    community.

[^334]: A principle not followed by some contemporary Buddhist schools
    that harbor "secret teachings".

[^335]: "Closed fist of a teacher" is *ācariyamuṭṭhi*.

[^336]: *Pariharissāmi* needs careful parsing with regard
    to tenses. The general meaning is to "carry about" or "maintain,
    nurture". The Buddha elsewhere said that he "leads" the
    Saṅgha ([DN
    26:25.6](https://suttacentral.net/dn26/en/sujato#25.6):
    *pariharāmi*). When the Buddha was about to go on
    retreat, Moggallāna said that he and
    Sāriputta "shall lead" (*pariharissāmi*),
    to which the Buddha said they "should lead" ([MN
    67:13.7](https://suttacentral.net/mn67/en/sujato#13.7):
    *parihareyyaṁ*). Devadatta, on the other hand, ensured
    his downfall when he determined that he "shall lead" the
    Saṅgha, having taken over from the Buddha ([AN
    5.100:2.3](https://suttacentral.net/an5.100/en/sujato#2.3), [Kd
    1:2.1.23](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#2.1.23)).
    Thus the future tense indicates the determination to lead. But at
    this point, the Buddha's mind is already set on letting go. He is
    not saying that no-one should lead the Saṅgha, but that
    it is up to whoever leads it to address the issues.

[^337]: The reading and derivation of *veṭhamissakena* are
    unclear. As a form of violence we find *veṭhamissena*
    at [Thag 2.12:1.1](https://suttacentral.net/thag2.12/en/sujato#1.1),
    notably also in instrumental. *Veṭha* means "twist,
    strap, turban". *Missa* means "mixed" or "plaited" ([Bu Ss
    2:2.1.21](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2/en/sujato#2.1.21)).
    Thus it probably refers to a kind of strong twisted material used to
    tie or bind, i.e. rope.

[^338]: Compare Rig Veda 8.48.5: "As leather binds a chariot, soma knits
    my joints together." Bṛhadāraṇyaka
    Upaniṣad 4.3.35 compares the labored breathing of one
    near death with the creaking of a heavily-laden cart.

[^339]: The suttas say little about this signless (*animitta*)
    meditation. Its defining characteristic is that consciousness does
    not "follow after signs" (*nimittānusāri
    viññāṇaṁ*, eg. [AN
    6.13:5.3](https://suttacentral.net/an6.13/en/sujato#5.3)). This is
    explained in [MN
    138:10.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn138/en/sujato#10.2) as not
    being distracted or affected by the features of sense impressions,
    as the "signs" are created by greed, hate, and delusion ([MN
    43:37.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn43/en/sujato#37.1)). The mental
    unification (*ekattaṁ*) based on this practice is
    listed after the form (and formless) *jhānas*, so it is
    very advanced. It is nonetheless a conditioned state ([MN
    121:11.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn121/en/sujato#11.4)), so it is
    possible that a mendicant might fall from it and disrobe ([AN
    6.60:8.10](https://suttacentral.net/an6.60/en/sujato#8.10)). However
    it may also be used to describe the meditation of an arahant ([SN
    41.7:6.12](https://suttacentral.net/sn41.7/en/sujato#6.12)). It is
    clear from [MN
    121:10.5](https://suttacentral.net/mn121/en/sujato#10.5) that the
    six senses are still functioning, unlike in deep serenity
    meditations. It seems that in such a state, the Buddha was able to
    function normally while seeing through the pain in his body.

[^340]: This central theme of the Buddha's teaching---that each of us is
    responsible for our own salvation---becomes even more important as
    the Buddha's days grow short.

[^341]: Read *tama(t)agge* with *tama* as superlative, literally "at the
    peak of the best".

[^342]: This detail is often mentioned in texts of the
    Sarvāstivāda school, but rarely in Pali.

[^343]: Normally *kappa* as a period of time means "eon", but the late
    canonical texts Kathāvatthu ([Kv
    11.5](https://suttacentral.net/kv11.5)) and
    Milindapañha ([Mil
    5.1.10](https://suttacentral.net/mil5.1.10)) argue that it means the
    "lifespan", an interpretation followed by the commentaries. Support
    for this comes from [DN
    26:28.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn26/en/sujato#28.3), which says
    that "long life" for a mendicant is the four bases of psychic power
    which enable you to remain for the *kappa*. Here it is surely
    talking about a full lifespan. Underlying this is the idea that in
    different epochs the "proper lifespan" varies; in the Buddha's day
    it was one hundred years ([DN
    14:1.7.7](https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#1.7.7)). We can
    resolve the problem if we read *kappa* here, not as a period of
    time, but as "proper, fitting", i.e. the "proper" lifespan of a
    hundred years.

[^344]: Here Ānanda's mind is "as if" possessed (*yathā*),
    but in the Vinaya *yathā* is missing: he is possessed
    ([Kd
    1:1.10.17](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#1.10.17)).
    Remember, Ānanda is telling this story about himself.

[^345]: Māra is the Buddhist deity of death, sex, and
    delusion; his aim is to trap beings in transmigration. He appears in
    many guises, both real and metaphorical, throughout the canon, but
    this sequence is his only direct appearance in the
    Dīghanikāya. Here he feigns compassion, urging the
    Buddha to find his final peace; but he has an ulterior motive, for
    with the Buddha's passing Māra's job will be much
    easier.

[^346]: *Parinibbāna* means "extinguishment", as of a
    flame. Here it appears as both noun ("extinguishment") and verb
    ("become extinguished"). It is not a particularly difficult term to
    translate. Linguistically it has nothing to do with "attachment", so
    renderings such as "unbinding" are untenable. It should be
    translated rather than just keeping "Nibbāna", not
    least because English resists verbifying adopted words, resulting in
    such constructions as "enter Nibbāna", which reifies it
    in a way that the Pali does not.

[^347]: Māra is citing the Buddha's words for his own
    purpose. The Pali tradition does not say when this encounter took
    place, but the Sanskrit Sarvāstivāda
    Catuṣparisatsūtra places it shortly after the Buddha's
    awakening.

[^348]: This passage makes it clear that it was the Buddha's intention
    from the beginning to establish an order of nuns
    (*bhikkhunī*).

[^349]: This passage is the narrative inverse of the occasion when
    Brahmā begged the Buddha to teach ([SN
    6.1:5.5](https://suttacentral.net/sn6.1/en/sujato#5.5), etc.).
    Throughout, the sutta artfully preserves a degree of narrative
    ambiguity. Here it almost appears as if the Buddha assents to
    passing away because of Māra's request, although his
    intent was clear earlier. Māra's reasoning, moreover,
    is based on the Buddha's own words.

[^350]: It seems that at this point, the Buddha is still spending the
    rains in Beluva village, from where he would sometimes go to nearby
    Vesālī for alms, or to a local shrine for meditation.
    He left Vesālī only after holding a meeting for all the
    Saṅgha, which probably signified the completion of the
    rains ([DN
    16:4.1.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#4.1.2)). If this
    reasoning is correct---and the text is not explicit---then he made
    this statement during the rains retreat. If, however, this reasoning
    is incorrect and we are already after the rains, it could not have
    been long after. Thus it is probably September/October, meaning that
    the final extinguishment was to take place in December/January. This
    conflicts with the tradition of ascribing his final extinguishment
    to the full moon of Vesak, in May.

[^351]: The Cāpāla shrine is unknown outside of this
    context. The Udāna commentary says that it was named
    after the *yakkha* who formerly lived there. Now,
    *cāpalla* means "fickleness, propensity to tremble" and
    is from the same root as earth-"quake" (*bhumicāla*;
    *capala* = *pacala* via metathesis). It is no great leap to
    *cāpāla*. If this is correct, it suggests that the
    shrine was dedicated to an earth spirit who commanded earthquakes; a
    fitting setting for the events to follow.

[^352]: Northern India lies in the shadow of the seismically active
    Alpide Belt, so the occurrence of earthquakes is realistic even if
    the causes are not scientific.

[^353]: For this difficult verse, I generally follow Bhikkhu Bodhi's
    long discussion in *Connected Discourses of the Buddha*, note 255 on
    the Mahāvagga. \| *Sambhava* means "production,
    creation", and here I think it refers to the prolonging of life
    which the Buddha had just rejected.

[^354]: *Bhavasaṅkhāra* ("life force") here is equivalent
    to *āyusaṅkhāra* and *jīvitasaṅkhāra*.

[^355]: *Attasambhava* ("self-creation") refers back to *sambhava* in
    the first line.

[^356]: So far as it goes, this is a naturalistic explanation. The
    "water element" has the quality of softening, while the "air
    element" is traditionally understood as "movement". Thus in modern
    terms this means, "When underground forces disturb a region of
    instability."

[^357]: The might of ascetics was legendary in ancient India (eg. [MN
    56:14.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn56/en/sujato#14.2)). The
    meditation described here might be compared with the "dimensions of
    mastery" below ([DN
    16:3.25.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#3.25.1)).

[^358]: At [DN
    14:1.17.7](https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#1.17.7) and [MN
    123:7.6](https://suttacentral.net/mn123/en/sujato#7.6) it is,
    rather, the entire galaxy that trembles, perhaps indicating that the
    enhanced miracle is a later development.

[^359]: There are many accounts of the Buddha's awakening in the suttas,
    but none, so far as I know, that mention an earthquake.

[^360]: See [SN
    56.11:13.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11/en/sujato#13.2).

[^361]: This refers to the Buddha's death. The Pali here uses both
    *nibbāna* and *parinibbāna*. Sometimes it
    is said that *nibbāna* is the attainment of
    arahantship, while *parinibbāna* is the death of an
    arahant, but this distinction is not consistently applied in the
    suttas. \| Regarding *nibbānadhātuyā* ("the element of
    extinguishment"), in Pali the case is ambiguous. It is sometimes
    translated "by means of" or "through", which assumes the
    instrumental; but the Sanskrit is *nirvāṇadhātau*,
    which must be locative.

[^362]: As at [AN 8.69](https://suttacentral.net/an8.69/en/sujato). The
    following series of "eight things" seems arbitrarily inserted here
    and breaks the flow of the narrative. They are absent from the
    Sanskrit Sarvāstivāda text edited by Waldschmidt, which
    goes directly to the conversation where Ānanda realizes that the
    Buddha is going to die.

[^363]: These "assemblies" were formal deliberative meetings, not just
    gatherings. Thus "householders" here does not mean "lay folk" in
    apposition to "ascetics"; rather it means "home owners". Some of
    these assemblies are depicted or alluded to in the
    Dīghanikāya. At [DN
    6:1.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn6/en/sujato#1.3), brahmins
    assemble in Vesālī; while at [DN
    3:1.13.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato#1.13.3),
    Ambaṭṭha speaks of an assembly of Sakyans, who were
    aristocrats. At [DN
    18:12.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn18/en/sujato#12.1), we get a
    glimpse of the proceedings at a meeting of the gods of the
    thirty-three.

[^364]: There do not appear to be any records of this happening in the
    early texts, although that is perhaps to be expected. It does feel
    out of character for the Buddha, as normally he is very up front.
    The commentary says that this ruse was adopted so the Buddha could
    plant subtle seeds (*vāsanā*) for the future.

[^365]: These are another way of describing the different experiences of
    *jhāna*. Also at [AN
    8.65](https://suttacentral.net/an8.65/en/sujato), [AN
    10.29:6.1](https://suttacentral.net/an10.29/en/sujato#6.1), [DN
    33:3.1.142](https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#3.1.142), [DN
    34:2.1.160](https://suttacentral.net/dn34/en/sujato#2.1.160), and
    [MN 77:23.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn77/en/sujato#23.1).

[^366]: "Perceiving form (*rūpa*) internally" refers to
    someone developing meditation based on an aspect of their own body,
    such as the breath or the parts of the body. The "forms"
    (*rūpā*) seen externally are the lights or other
    meditation phenomena that today are usually called *nimitta*. An
    "ugly" form is the mental image that arises in such contemplations
    as the parts of the body. A "beautiful" image arises from practices
    such as mindfulness of breathing.

[^367]: "Not perceiving form internally" refers to meditations such as
    the external elements, or the decaying of another's body.

[^368]: This is the meditation where one contemplates an external color,
    either a prepared disk or a natural phenomena such as the sky or a
    flower, which eventually gives rise to a "counterpart" image. Today
    such meditations are called *kasiṇa* following the
    Visuddhimagga, but in the early texts *kasiṇa* means
    "totality" and refers rather to the state of *samādhi*
    that results.

[^369]: Already encountered at [DN
    15:35.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn15/en/sujato#35.1).

[^370]: Note that this is the idiom that Ānanda uses when directly
    quoting the Buddha.

[^371]: "Misdeed" is *dukkaṭaṁ*. This term is familiar as
    the most minor class of offences in the Vinaya. Here we see an
    informal use of the term as something that has been wrongly done,
    rather than a legal violation. It is used in a similar way by
    Mākassapa at the First Council, who accuses Ānanda of
    several misdeeds. As a legal term, *dukkaṭa* is late;
    the category of offences is not found in the Vinayas of the
    Mahāsaṅghika group of schools, which use
    *vinayatikkrama* for a similar idea.

[^372]: The Buddha goes on to list multiple places where he hinted to
    Ānanda, but the only record of such a conversation is at the
    Cāpāla Shrine.

[^373]: The following group of places are all near
    Rājagaha, and collectively illustrate the variety of
    dwellings and environs enjoyed by the mendicants practicing there.
    \| The Gotama banyan tree shrine is mentioned only here. Gotama is a
    common name, and this shrine does not appear to have any connection
    with the Buddha.

[^374]: A cliff from which bandits were tossed as a means of execution.

[^375]: The Pali tradition says the First Council was held near the
    entrance to this cave (Dīpavaṁsa 4.19,
    Mahāvaṁsa 3.19, Samantapāsādikā
    Paṭhamamahāsaṅgītikathā). The Vinayas all agree that it
    was at Rājagaha, but traditions vary as to the exact
    location.

[^376]: A large open area where Jains did their penances ([MN
    14:15.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn14/en/sujato#15.2)) and the
    Buddha taught occasionally ([SN
    8.10](https://suttacentral.net/sn8.10/en/sujato)), but it is most
    famous as the place the monks Godhika ([SN
    4.23](https://suttacentral.net/sn4.23/en/sujato)) and Vakkali took
    their lives ([SN
    22.87](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.87/en/sujato)).

[^377]: Mentioned several times in the suttas as a pleasant place to
    meditate, it is notable as the site of the conversion of the
    Buddha's chief layman disciple Anāthapiṇḍika ([SN
    10.8](https://suttacentral.net/sn10.8/en/sujato)). But the most
    famous event there was when the Buddha moderated the monk
    Soṇa's excessive striving ([AN
    6.55](https://suttacentral.net/an6.55/en/sujato)).

[^378]: The hot springs near Rājagaha were a popular place
    for monks to bathe, so much so that they prompted a rule ensuring
    that the monks did not monopolize the springs ([Bu Pc
    57](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57/en/sujato)). They are
    still in use and just as popular as ever.

[^379]: A personal gift of King Bimbisāra, this was the
    first permanent monastery offered to the Buddha and his
    Saṅgha ([Kd
    1:22.17.3](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#22.17.3)).

[^380]: Mahākappina stayed here ([Kd
    1:5.3.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#5.3.1)), and
    the Buddha rested there when his foot was first injured, apparently
    by Devadatta, before Jīvaka offered his mango grove
    ([SN 1.38](https://suttacentral.net/sn1.38/en/sujato), [SN
    4.13](https://suttacentral.net/sn4.13/en/sujato)).

[^381]: The following group of places are all in the Vajjian country
    near Vesālī. Whereas the varied sites around
    Rājagaha reflect the rugged terrain there, at
    Vesālī all the sites are tree-shrines, as the
    surrounding land is flat. [DN
    24:1.11.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn24/en/sujato#1.11.5) indicates
    where they lay relative to Vesālī; the Udena shrine was
    to the east, and the next three to the south, west, and north
    respectively. \| *Udena* is an epithet of the "arising" sun (Rig
    Veda 1.48.7), although here it may have the sense "prosperity".

[^382]: Named after the local *yakkha*, to whom offerings would have
    been made. It could get cold enough to snow, prompting the Buddha to
    lay down a rule permitting three robes ([Kd
    1:13.2.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#13.2.1)). A
    short but galaxy-shaking discourse was once taught there ([AN
    3.125:0.3](https://suttacentral.net/an3.125/en/sujato#0.3)).

[^383]: The Pali has *amba* ("mango") and *ambaka* ("maiden") as
    variants. The commentary supports the latter, saying it was named
    for seven legendary princesses of Varanasi in the time of Buddha
    Kassapa, all of whom went on to become great disciples of our
    Buddha. I made this translation on the small island of Qimei off the
    south coast of Taiwan, where there is a shrine to the "seven
    maidens" who gave the island its name. Stories of "seven maidens"
    are widespread in myth and folklore all over the world, including
    Aboriginal Dreamtime stories. The archetype descends from the
    constellation known in English as Pleiades and in Sanskrit as
    Kṛttikā. Since there are six main visible stars in the
    cluster today, the stories often tell of how the youngest of the
    seven sisters was lost. In the Buddhist telling this is
    Visākhā, the only sister not to become an arahant in
    this life.

[^384]: This was, obviously, a fertility shrine.

[^385]: Previously mentioned as the place where the seven principles of
    non-decline were taught to the Licchavis. The meaning of
    Sārandada is obscure and variants profligate, but it
    might be derived from the Munda word *sara*, "funeral pyre". The
    commentary says it was taken over from an old shrine to a *yakkha*
    of that name.

[^386]: "Take back" is *paccāvamissati*, which has several
    variants. It occurs in [Ja
    69](https://suttacentral.net/ja69/en/sujato) and [Ja
    509](https://suttacentral.net/ja509/en/sujato), where it is the
    opposite of *vamati*, to "expel, vomit".

[^387]: This was the major Saṅgha residence near
    Vesālī. The Great Wood, according to the commentary,
    stretched as far as the Himalayas. Later tradition says that a town
    should have three woods: a "great wood" for wilderness
    (*mahāvana*); a "prosperity wood" for resources
    (*sirivana*); and an "ascetic wood" for spiritual practice
    (*tapovana*).

[^388]: Compare the earlier request to gather all the mendicants around
    Rājagaha ([DN
    16:1.6.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#1.6.2)).

[^389]: Memorization was considered an essential basis for learning. In
    similar passages, we also find the injunction to "recite" the
    teachings, thus authorizing the recitation of the Buddha's teachings
    after his death, which was later formalized in the Councils
    (*saṅgīti*).

[^390]: These are the sets of practices later called the 37
    *bodhiyapakkhiyā dhammā*, the "wings to
    awakening". Here they are presented as an essential summary of the
    Buddha's teachings. They form the backbone of the final book of the
    Saṁyuttanikāya, the Maggavagga (or
    Mahāvagga). It is likely that the Buddha was referring
    to the earliest recension of this text. They are found as a summary
    of the Buddha's teachings at [DN
    29:17.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato#17.3), [MN
    103:3.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn103/en/sujato#3.2), [MN
    104:5.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn104/en/sujato#5.3), and [AN
    8.19:17.2](https://suttacentral.net/an8.19/en/sujato#17.2) = [Ud
    5.5:25.2](https://suttacentral.net/ud5.5/en/sujato#25.2).

[^391]: This is perhaps the briefest summary possible of the Buddha's
    teaching. The world as it is, and all the beings in it, are created
    and sustained through conditions. Since the conditions that sustain
    them are finite, the conditioned phenomena are also finite and must
    come to an end. Reflecting on this gives rise to gratitude for the
    life we have and the opportunities it grants us, and determination
    to live and practice dedicated to the realization of the
    unconditioned, Nibbana.

[^392]: "Ripe old age" is *paripakko vayo*.

[^393]: "Well-settled thoughts" is *susamāhitasaṅkappā*.
    Compare *asamāhitasaṅkappo* at [AN
    4.22:5.3](https://suttacentral.net/an4.22/en/sujato#5.3).

[^394]: *Nāgāpalokitaṁ* is the "elephant look". There is a
    similar Sanskrit term *siṁhāvalokana*, the "lion look",
    said to be the slow glance back that a lion makes as he leaves his
    kill. There is a nuance in meaning here, because while *apalokana*
    literally means to "look back", it is used in the sense to "take
    leave" before setting out on a journey.

[^395]: *Bhaṇḍagāma*, where *bhaṇḍa* means
    "wares"; it must have been a trading post. It seems the villages in
    this passage were named after their chief economic activity, so I
    translate them to highlight this pragmatic system.

[^396]: This four also found at [AN
    4.1:2.3](https://suttacentral.net/an4.1/en/sujato#2.3) and [AN
    7.66:14.4](https://suttacentral.net/an7.66/en/sujato#14.4).

[^397]: Here the text refers to the Buddha in the third person; compare
    the previous set of verses in first person. Although the text states
    that these verses were spoken by the Buddha, it is possible that, as
    with many similar cases especially in the
    Aṅguttaranikāya, the verses were added by redactors.

[^398]: Note the use of "quenched" (*parinibbuto*) here while the Buddha
    is still alive.

[^399]: *Hatthigāma*, probably a village which specialized
    in training elephants.

[^400]: *Ambagāma*.

[^401]: *Jambugāma*.

[^402]: Departing from the economic naming scheme, here *bhoga* does not
    mean "wealth". Rather, the Bhogas were one of the clans of the Vajji
    Federation.

[^403]: "Great references" is *mahāpadesa*; also at [AN
    4.180](https://suttacentral.net/an4.180/en/sujato). A different set
    of four *mahāpadesas* are [Kd
    1:40.1.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#40.1.1),
    which provide criteria by which mendicants may judge what is and is
    not allowable.

[^404]: The phrase used in the suttas when reporting a teaching heard
    directly from the Buddha, eg. [SN
    55.52:5.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn55.52/en/sujato#5.1), [SN
    22.90:9.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.90/en/sujato#9.1), [MN
    47:10.7](https://suttacentral.net/mn47/en/sujato#10.7), etc.

[^405]: *Dhamma*, *vinaya*, and *satthusāsana* are used in
    the suttas in the general sense of the entirety of the Buddha's
    teachings. In his advice to Mahāpajāpatī ([AN
    8.53](https://suttacentral.net/an8.53/en/sujato)) and
    Upāli ([AN
    7.83](https://suttacentral.net/an7.83/en/sujato)), they are said to
    be whatever conforms with letting go. A stream-enterer who is a lay
    person is grounded in them ([AN
    6.16:7.2](https://suttacentral.net/an6.16/en/sujato#7.2)). They are
    more frequent in the Vinaya, being used as a general qualifier of a
    legitimate legal procedure ([Bu Pc
    63:2.1.8](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc63/en/sujato#2.1.8)).
    Due to this, the fact that there are three items, and the fact that
    *dhamma* and *sutta* are different words, we should not take
    *dhamma* and *vinaya* here as equivalent to *sutta* and *vinaya*
    below. Rather, they are a general claim to authenticity and do not
    specify particular texts.

[^406]: As at [MN
    112:3.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn112/en/sujato#3.1), [DN
    29:18.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato#18.4), and [AN
    4.180:2.5](https://suttacentral.net/an4.180/en/sujato#2.5).

[^407]: It is tempting to assume that *sutta* here means the
    Suttapiṭaka and *vinaya* means the
    Vinayapiṭaka, or at least an earlier version of these
    texts; but this is not supported by tradition. The late canonical
    Netti explains *sutta* as "the four noble truths" and *vinaya* as
    "the removal of greed, hate, and delusion" ([Ne
    6](https://suttacentral.net/ne6/en/sujato)). The commentaries
    discuss many interpretations; ultimately they agree with the Netti
    for *vinaya*, but say *sutta* means the entire
    Tipiṭaka. I think the Netti is correct: teachings
    should "fit in" with the four noble truths (like other footprints
    fit in to an elephant's footprint, [MN
    28](https://suttacentral.net/mn28/en/sujato)), and they should "be
    exhibited" in that the results of practice should be apparent
    (*sandiṭṭhika*). \| "Memorize"
    (*uggahetvā*), because in an oral tradition a text is
    not learned until it is known by heart; such claims must be taken
    seriously. \| "Fit into" is *osāreti* or
    *otāreti* per [AN
    4.180](https://suttacentral.net/an4.180/en/sujato); the two words
    have a similar meaning, "to flow down into".

[^408]: The text has *ca* ("and") rather than *vā* ("or"),
    which would be expected if they were to be found in one or other
    textual collection. This is urging that any teaching fits in with
    the fundamental principles of the four noble truths, and is
    effective in removing defilements.

[^409]: The Pali text appears to say that one should remember the
    *mahāpadesa*, whereas the Sanskrit clearly says one
    should remember the passage (*ayaṁ
    dharmo'yaṁ vinaya idaṁ śāstuḥ
    śāsanam iti viditvā
    dhārayitavyāḥ*). It seems as if this pattern should
    underlie the Pali too, for if the passage is false, one "should
    reject it" (*chaḍḍeyyātha*). In the case of a correct
    passage we should expect a parallel injunction that one "should
    remember it" (*dhāreyyātha*). But if this applies to
    the *mahāpadesa* there is no such injunction. Thus it
    seems as if the Sanskrit is correct here and the Pali corrupt. I
    restore it by reversing the order of the phrases.

[^410]: Each of the four references is a little less solid than the
    previous. Here one hasn't heard from the Buddha, but from the
    Saṅgha. The fact that one hears it from the
    Saṅgha implies a kind of formal group recitation such
    as a *saṅgīti* or "council".

[^411]: Now one learns not from a unified Saṅgha, but from
    several learned elders. This is a stock description of learned
    mendicants (eg. [AN
    3.20:6.2](https://suttacentral.net/an3.20/en/sujato#6.2)). \|
    "Inheritors of the heritage" is *āgatāgamā*, where
    *āgama* means "what has come down", namely the
    scriptural heritage. *Āgama* is a synonym for *nikāya*
    in the sense of "collection of scripture". \| The "outlines"
    (*mātikā*, literally "matrix") are the summary outlines
    of topics that served as seeds for the development of Abhidhamma.
    [DN 16:3.50.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#3.50.5)
    features one of the earliest of such lists, the 37 path factors that
    the Buddha "taught from his own direct knowledge". These serve as
    outline for the section on the path in the Saṁyutta,
    from where they were adopted in various Abhidhamma texts such as the
    Vibhaṅga.

[^412]: Finally the testimony of a single mendicant, which is the
    weakest of all. Nonetheless, the procedure is the same.

[^413]: The parallel at [AN
    4.180:9.11](https://suttacentral.net/an4.180/en/sujato#9.11) omits
    *dhāreyyāthā*, which I take to be the correct reading.
    See my note on *dhāreyyāthā* at [DN
    16:4.8.13](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#4.8.13).

[^414]: Pāvā, a town of the Mallas, has more significance
    for this narrative than appears at first sight. It was, according to
    Buddhist texts, the place where Mahāvīra had recently
    died, plunging the Jains into chaos. (The Jains, however, say this
    was another Pāvā, east of Nāḷandā.)
    Pāvā became associated with especially ascetic monks:
    thirty Pāvā monks became awakened on hearing a
    particularly strong discourse ([SN
    15.13](https://suttacentral.net/sn15.13/en/sujato));
    Mahākassapa heard the news of the Buddha's passing at
    Pāvā; and monks from Pāvā allied with
    monks of "Avanti and the south" arguing for strict Vinaya in the
    Second Council ([Kd
    1:1.7.11](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#1.7.11)).

[^415]: This passage also at [Ud
    8.5](https://suttacentral.net/ud8.5/en/sujato).

[^416]: Cunda was apparently a metal-worker, which was an advanced form
    of technological craftsmanship.

[^417]: This is, according to the commentary, preserved as the other
    discourse taught to Cunda, which deals with proper asceticism ([Snp
    1.5](https://suttacentral.net/snp1.5/en/sujato)).

[^418]: The exact meaning of *sūkaramaddava* is unclear.
    *Sūkara* is "pig", but some Chinese translations
    suggest the sense "mushroom"; and it is true that there are several
    names of plants or plant dishes that begin with
    *sūkara* or other animals. At [Dhp
    377](https://suttacentral.net/dhp377/en/sujato), flowers are
    described as *maddava*, meaning "overripe, withering on the vine".
    It is a common practice to allow meat to sit for a while to become
    tender and "high" for extra flavor when cooked. But this can lead to
    a proliferation of dangerous bacteria unless properly cooked, and
    such seems to have been the case here. In any case, this disputed
    term is marginal in a consideration of meat-eating in early
    Buddhism, which is discussed more fully elsewhere.

[^419]: If the Buddha knew the meal was dangerous, why ask to be served
    it? This is even more striking in light of the fact that it is a
    Vinaya offence to request fine food, including meat, and nowhere
    else is such a request recorded ([Bu Pc
    39:2.10.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39/en/sujato#2.10.1)).
    Such narrative ambiguities serve to escalate a sense of wonder.

[^420]: The Buddha's illness is sometimes diagnosed as mesenteric
    infarction. The Buddha's body rejects the world of conditioned
    existence entirely.

[^421]: The commentary says that these verses were added by the elders
    at the Council.

[^422]: The *saṅghāṭi* ("outer robe" or "cloak") is
    double-layered, and served both for warmth and as bedding. The
    Buddha has not recovered fully from his illness.

[^423]: The Buddha was an exemplary patient. He did not complain, but
    made his needs known clearly to his carer.

[^424]: It would seem that, since the Buddha was enduring his illness
    without complaint and with dignity, Ānanda did not fully realize how
    weak he has become.

[^425]: The bowl (*patta*) was used both for eating and drinking.

[^426]: Pukkusa is not elsewhere mentioned. The reference to
    Āḷāra Kālāma recalls the narrative of the
    bodhisatta's practices before awakening. There are several details
    that indicate the stories of the first part and the last part of the
    Buddha's life were unified by such callbacks. We meet the Malla clan
    later on.

[^427]: *Niśraya* in the sense of "near" occurs at
    Śatapathabrāhmaṇa 3.1.2.17.

[^428]: In deep meditation the senses cease to function.

[^429]: As were Mahāpajāpatī's limbs ([AN
    8.51](https://suttacentral.net/an8.51/en/sujato)).

[^430]: A nearby town where the Buddha had stayed previously ([Kd
    1:37.4.2](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#37.4.2)).

[^431]: *Siṅgīvaṇṇa*, or else *siṅgīsuvaṇṇa*
    ([AN 3.70:38.3](https://suttacentral.net/an3.70/en/sujato#38.3)), is
    gold from a mountain peak (*siṅgī*).
    Kauṭilya mentions a form of gold that is
    *śṛṅgaśūktija*, "occurring on mount Śūkti"
    (Arthaśāstra 2.13.3). The commentary to that passage
    says it had the color of red arsenic, so it would have been a rose
    gold color.

[^432]: Closing the narrative circle with the story of awakening.

[^433]: The commentary says this verse was added by the senior monks at
    the Council.

[^434]: The monk Cundaka makes an abrupt appearance here; this is the
    only mention of this name. The commentary to this passage calls him
    *cunda*, while the gloss to the parallel passage at [Ud
    8.5:14.3](https://suttacentral.net/ud8.5/en/sujato#14.3) has
    *cundaka* throughout. The diminutive ending *-ka* is perhaps meant
    to differentiate him from the smith Cunda. There are various Cundas
    whose connection is unclear. Mahācunda was one of the
    great disciples ([MN
    118:](https://suttacentral.net/mn118/en/sujato), [AN
    6.17](https://suttacentral.net/an6.17/en/sujato), [MN
    8](https://suttacentral.net/mn8/en/sujato)), who later brought the
    Dhamma to the land of the Cetīs ([AN
    6.46](https://suttacentral.net/an6.46/en/sujato), [AN
    10.24](https://suttacentral.net/an10.24/en/sujato)). He once stayed
    with Channa and Sāriputta ([MN
    144:4.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn144/en/sujato#4.1), [SN
    35.87:1.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.87/en/sujato#1.2)); the
    commentaries say he was in fact Sāriputta's younger
    brother. They also identify him with the "novice Cunda" who reported
    the deaths of Sāriputta ([SN
    47.13:1.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.13/en/sujato#1.3)) and
    Mahāvīra ([DN
    29:2.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato#2.1), [MN
    104:3.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn104/en/sujato#3.1)), explaining
    that the title "novice" was a nickname that persisted from the time
    he ordained as a young novice. It is unclear whether the
    commentaries take the Cundaka of this passage to be the same person,
    but he is here performing a similar role as carer adjacent to the
    Buddha's death. Later there appears a Cūḷacunda ([Tha
    Ap 52:13.3](https://suttacentral.net/tha-ap52/en/sujato#13.3)). Thus
    there may have been one person known by different names, or several
    people whose stories have become conflated.

[^435]: These verses were also added at the Council according to the
    commentary.

[^436]: Adopt PTS and BJT reading *satthā
    pavattā*.

[^437]: The text addresses Cunda with the respectful
    *āvuso*.

[^438]: Again, the narrative circle.

[^439]: The text uses *āyasmā* here for Cunda, as does the
    Sanskrit, whereas it is normally reserved for mendicants (see below,
    [DN 16:6.2.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#6.2.1)).

[^440]: This became a point of discussion in later Buddhism: can it be
    that the merit of a gift grows after it is given?

[^441]: Known today as Kushinagar, it is a popular site for pilgrims,
    with many ancient stupas, Buddha images, and a peaceful park for
    meditation.

[^442]: Normally when the Buddha lies down, his mind is focused on
    getting up. But now he knows that he will not rise again.

[^443]: Sal trees blossom in April/May. This detail agrees with the
    Buddha's final extinguishment in December/January, rather than in
    May (Vesak) as is currently celebrated (see note to [DN
    16:3.9.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#3.9.3)).

[^444]: This calls back to the description of the fourfold assembly in
    the Māra section above ([DN
    16:3.7.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#3.7.4)).

[^445]: This kind of narrative elevation is characteristic of the
    Buddha's teaching. He did not try to deny or eliminate any belief in
    the miraculous, or in the power of devotion, but rather to show that
    such things were of limited worth compared with practice.

[^446]: Like Cundaka above, Upavāna shares the duties of an
    attendant with Ānanda; at [DN
    29:41.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato#41.1) he is also
    fanning the Buddha. At [AN
    5.166](https://suttacentral.net/an5.166/en/sujato), Ānanda goes to
    Upavāna for support when he feels he has disappointed
    the Buddha.

[^447]: In [SN 7.13](https://suttacentral.net/sn7.13/en/sujato)
    Upavāna fetched hot water and molasses for the Buddha,
    an event he remembered in his own verses at [Thag
    2.33](https://suttacentral.net/thag2.33/en/sujato).

[^448]: For this usage of *phuṭo*, see [AN
    3.56:1.3](https://suttacentral.net/an3.56/en/sujato#1.3).

[^449]: Elsewhere, *pathavīsaññī* refers to those who
    develop a form of meditation where they are "percipient of earth"
    ([AN 10.6:1.2](https://suttacentral.net/an10.6/en/sujato#1.2)).
    Here, however, it simply means those deities who are aware of events
    on the ground. \| Read *chinnaṁpādaṁ viya papatanti*.

[^450]: The Buddha as "eye" evokes the common (eg. Rig Veda 1.164.14,
    5.40.8, 5.59.5, 10.10.9) Vedic image of the Sun as the "eye of all"
    (*viśvacakṣāḥ*, 7.63.1), the "eye" for "eyes to see"
    (10.158.4), moving as an unaging wheel through the sky (1.164.14).
    See [Snp 3.9:11.1](https://suttacentral.net/snp3.9/en/sujato#11.1) =
    [MN 98:7.23](https://suttacentral.net/mn98/en/sujato#7.23). \| Pali
    has *cakkhuṁ loke* ("eye in the world"), Sanskrit has
    *cakṣur lokasya* ("eye of the world").

[^451]: These two reactions---grief and equanimity---are depicted often
    in Buddhist art and narrative. They stimulated the two poles of
    development of the Buddhist community. The devotional tradition,
    feeling the need for an emotional connection with the Teacher,
    developed art, story, and doctrines to, as it were, keep him alive,
    resulting in the Jātakas and the Bodhisattva doctrine.
    A cooler, rational tradition developed a comprehensive system
    analyzing the impermanence of "conditions", leading to the
    Abhidhamma.

[^452]: As for example at [MN
    24:2.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn24/en/sujato#2.1).

[^453]: *Manobhāvanīya* is explained in the commentaries as
    "those who, when seen, cause the mind to grow in what is skillful."

[^454]: These four sites are the primary destinations of modern Buddhist
    pilgrims in India. \| *Saṁvejanīya* is "stirring,
    provoking inspiration or urgency" such as when seeing an
    astonishing, disturbing, or amazing sight.

[^455]: Lumbinī in modern Nepal, which today is a
    well-maintained and quiet place for devotion and meditation. The
    site is marked with an Ashokan pillar dated perhaps 150 years after
    this time. On the pillar is inscribed in Brahmī
    characters *hida bhagavaṁ jāte ti*, which
    is a direct quote in Māgadhī of the Pali phrase here,
    *idha tathāgato jāto ti*.
    (*Tathāgata* "realized one" is how the Buddha referred
    to himself, while *bhagavā* "blessed one" is how his
    followers referred to him.) This is the oldest direct quote from the
    early canon preserved in the archaeological record.

[^456]: Bodhgaya in modern Bihar, which is called Uruvelā
    in the Pali texts. It is a bustling center for pilgrims from all
    over the Buddhist world, at the center of which is the great stupa
    next to the Bodhi tree.

[^457]: Isipatana is modern Sarnath, in the northern part of Varanasi on
    the Ganges. In the temple next to the park, the first sermon is
    recited every night. \| Note the passive voice, whereas the parallel
    at [AN 4.118](https://suttacentral.net/an4.118/en/sujato) is active.

[^458]: The phrase *nibbānadhātuyā parinibbuto*, "fully
    quenched in the element of extinguishment" shows how the Pali uses
    two roots simultaneously for Nibbana. The better-known term,
    *nibbāna* (Sanskrit *nirvāṇa*), is from
    the root *vā* ("to blow"), with the basic sense of
    going out through being deprived of air. The past participle form
    *nibbuta* (Sanskrit *nirvṛta*), from the root *var*
    ("to check or restrain"), has the basic sense of freedom from
    obstacles and constrictions. Generally, the Pali treats *nibbuta* as
    the past participle form of *nibbāna*, and for the most
    part the difference is purely verbal. Yet I believe the ambiguity is
    deliberate, as each captures a slightly different nuance of Nibbana.
    "Quenched" means both to go out like a flame and to be satisfied
    like a thirst. This positive feel appears in Sanskrit passages using
    *nirvṛta*, such as Manusmṛti 1.54, where
    it describes the blissful absorption of all beings into the great
    divinity. By using "extinguishment" for *nibbāna* and
    "quenched" for *nibbuta* I hope to express this subtle distinction,
    or at least to alert the reader that it exists.

[^459]: This passage is absent from the Sanskrit parallel and it is
    probably a late interpolation. Ānanda was handsome, and many stories
    of his encounters with women are preserved, for example at [Bu Pc
    41:1.1.5](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41/en/sujato#1.1.5).

[^460]: As it stands, this appears to contradict [MN
    152:2.10](https://suttacentral.net/mn152/en/sujato#2.10), where the
    Buddha ridicules the idea that sense restraint implies not seeing.
    The commentary, however, explains it as not looking at a woman who
    is standing in the doorway of a monk's hut, so as not to give rise
    to lust. Thus it restricts this apparently general rule to an
    unusually intimate encounter.

[^461]: The verb changes from *paṭipajjāma* (first person
    plural) to *paṭipajjitabbaṁ* (future passive
    participle), a shift that mirrors the following passage regarding
    the funeral proceedings. There, the shift to future passive
    participle indicates that the subject is the lay folk who carry out
    the funeral, whereas here that does not apply. This suggests that
    this passage has been derived from that later passage.

[^462]: The commentary refers to [AN
    5.55:6.5](https://suttacentral.net/an5.55/en/sujato#6.5), which
    speaks of chatting alone in private with a woman, a circumstance
    also dealt with in [Bu Pc
    45](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc45/en/sujato).

[^463]: Ānanda does not hesitate to let the Buddha know he has no
    intention of following his advice.

[^464]: The commentary says, quoting [SN
    35.127:1.6](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.127/en/sujato#1.6), that
    when a woman has sincere motivations, one should speak while
    thinking of them as a mother, a sister, or a daughter.

[^465]: "Corpse" is *sarīra*.

[^466]: For *abyāvaṭā* ("don't get involved"), compare
    *samaṇena bhavitabbaṁ
    abyāvaṭena* ("a monastic shouldn't get involved" (in
    domestic matters)) at [Bu Ss
    5:1.3.34](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5/en/sujato#1.3.34).

[^467]: Read *sadatthe* ("own goal") rather than *sāratthe*
    ("essential goal").

[^468]: An iron case was also used for Queen Bhaddā's body
    at [AN 5.50:1.6](https://suttacentral.net/an5.50/en/sujato#1.6). The
    second iron case does not "enclose" the first; rather it "crooks"
    (*paṭikujjati*) like a lid to "close it up".

[^469]: This is a rare mention of the *thūpa* ("sepulchral
    momunent") that became a major feature of the Buddhist landscape.
    Buddhist monuments were round in shape, which was apparently a
    characteristic of the lands around Magadha.
    Śatapathabrāhmaṇa 13.8.1.5 says that the correct form
    of such a monument was square, and that round monuments were built
    by godless "easterners".

[^470]: Here the Buddha is said to be explicitly instructing his
    followers to adopt the building of monuments from the local customs.

[^471]: "Independent Buddhas" are sages who discover the Dhamma and are
    awakened independently, but who do not themselves go on to found a
    dispensation or establish a monastic order. Text has
    *paccekasambuddho* rather than the usual *paccekabuddho*.

[^472]: This refers to the "eight individuals" who make up the
    "Saṅgha of disciples", namely those who have achieved
    the four stages of awakening and those on the path.

[^473]: In contrast with Ajātasattu.

[^474]: Like Queen Subhaddā, wife of
    Mahāsudassana, at [DN
    17:2.8.7](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato#2.8.7) and [DN
    17:2.12.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato#2.12.1). \|
    *Kapisīsa* is door-jamb, not lintel. \| For
    *vihāra* ("building") the commentary has "pavilion"
    (*maṇḍalamāla*), which may have been a temporary
    construction for the occasion (compare [MN
    92:4.6](https://suttacentral.net/mn92/en/sujato#4.6)).

[^475]: At this point Ānanda was a stream-enterer.

[^476]: When admonishing Ānanda, the Buddha first gently but firmly
    restrains him, then gives words of support and encouragement.

[^477]: The phrase "undivided and limitless" (*advayena
    appamāṇena*) normally describes *kasiṇa*
    meditation ([AN
    10.25:1.3](https://suttacentral.net/an10.25/en/sujato#1.3)); here it
    is also found in the Sanskrit: *ānanda
    maitreṇa kāyakarmaṇā hitena
    sukhenādvayenāpramāṇena*.

[^478]: On the eve of the First Council---in about six months
    time---Ānanda devoted himself to meditation and achieved
    arahantship.

[^479]: The same is said regarding the chief disciples
    Sāriputta and Moggallāna at [SN
    47.14:2.4](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.14/en/sujato#2.4) and
    regarding assemblies of deities at [DN
    20:4.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn20/en/sujato#4.3).

[^480]: *Tittha*, literally "ford", is a path to salvation, used as a
    term for a non-Buddhist "religion". *Titthakara* is a "religious
    founder" (literally "ford-maker"); *titthiya* is a "monastic of
    (another) religion" (for example at [Bu NP
    22:1.2.5](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np22/en/sujato#1.2.5));
    *titthiyasāvaka* is a "disciple of a monastic of
    (another) religion".

[^481]: As at [AN
    4.130:6.4](https://suttacentral.net/an4.130/en/sujato#6.4). Ānanda
    was in awe of the "incredible and amazing" qualities of the Buddha,
    and spoke of them often. Here, when Ānanda is at his most
    vulnerable, the Buddha turns the teaching around, pointing out that
    Ānanda is incredible and amazing too.

[^482]: This anticipates the story to follow.

[^483]: Campā, Rājagaha,
    Sāvatthī, and Kosambī were the capitals of
    Aṅga, Magadha, Kosala, and Vaccha respectively.
    Sāketa was the former capital of Kosala. Varanasi was
    formerly the capital of Kāsi, but at this time was
    contested by Kosala and Magadha, and had recently been won from
    Ajātasattu ([SN
    3.14](https://suttacentral.net/sn3.14/en/sujato), [SN
    3.15](https://suttacentral.net/sn3.15/en/sujato)).

[^484]: This story is also found in [DN
    17](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato). It seems that the Pali
    tradition extracted the story and greatly expanded it in an
    independent long discourse, whereas the Sanskrit tradition kept it
    at a more moderate length within the
    Mahāparinirvāṇasūtra itself.

[^485]: Kusāvatī features in the Kusajātaka
    ([Ja 531](https://suttacentral.net/ja531/en/sujato)), where the ugly
    but wise prince Kusa, son of the legendary Okkāka, wins
    the hand of the radiant Pabhāvatī. The
    Rāmāyaṇa also tells the story of a Kusa, son of
    Rāma, who ruled the city of Kusāvatī,
    although this city was located far to the south in the Vindhya
    ranges. Both stories are united by the detail that *kusa* grass, a
    prominent feature of Vedic ritual, ensured the kingly lineage.

[^486]: A "league" (*yojana*) is usually estimated at between seven and
    twelve kilometers. By way of comparison, even at its greatest extent
    under Ashoka, Pāṭaliputta was less than a league per
    side, so the dimensions of Kusāvatī here are strictly
    legendary.

[^487]: According to [DN 32](https://suttacentral.net/dn32/en/sujato),
    Āḷakamandā was one of the many cities of Kuvera in
    Uttarakuru.

[^488]: Vāseṭṭha is a Vedic priestly clan. The Mallas
    adopted the name of their priest's lineage, which was the normal
    custom for initiated *khattiyas*. Other examples in the Pali are
    Saccaka who is called Aggivessana ([MN
    35:4.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn35/en/sujato#4.2)), and the
    Buddha and his family who are called Gotama.

[^489]: *Attadutiyo* "with self as second" is also at [MN
    146:4.6](https://suttacentral.net/mn146/en/sujato#4.6) where Nandaka
    visits the nuns. Sanskrit has *bhikṣuṇā
    paścācchramaṇena* ("with a mendicant as accompanying
    ascetic"). It was apparently evening (the "wrong time",
    *vikāla*), when it is inappropriate for a monk to be
    wandering the town alone.

[^490]: Evidently the Mallas, like the Vajjis, met frequently.

[^491]: This is the second Subhadda we have met in this discourse, the
    first being a deceased devotee of Ñātika ([DN
    16:2.6.13](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#2.6.13)). The
    corrupt monk who, after the Buddha's death, urges the rejection of
    the Vinaya rules is another person of the same name ([DN
    16:6.20.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#6.20.1)). The
    Mahāsudassanasutta also features a Queen
    Subhaddā ([DN
    17:2.5.9](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato#2.5.9)).

[^492]: While some such as Mahāvīra the Ñātika
    ([MN 14:17.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn14/en/sujato#17.2)) and
    Pūraṇa Kassapa ([AN
    9.38:2.1](https://suttacentral.net/an9.38/en/sujato#2.1)) claimed to
    have direct knowledge, others such as Ajita Kesakambala denied that
    such knowledge was possible ([DN
    2:23.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#23.2)).

[^493]: The Buddha responded the same way when asked this question by
    the brahmin Piṅgalakoccha ([MN
    30:2.6](https://suttacentral.net/mn30/en/sujato#2.6)), and to a
    similar question at [AN
    9.38:3.2](https://suttacentral.net/an9.38/en/sujato#3.2).

[^494]: The four ascetics are defined at [AN
    4.241:1.1](https://suttacentral.net/an4.241/en/sujato#1.1) as those
    on the four paths.

[^495]: While many aspects of the eightfold path are shared with others,
    some details may be missing (such as not-self or
    Nibbāna), while others are added (such as the belief in
    the efficacy of rituals, an eternal soul, or a creator god).

[^496]: The Buddha points to the mendicants who have gathered there.

[^497]: This is the only place in the early texts where the Buddha
    identifies his age when going forth.

[^498]: Detailed in such suttas as [MN
    36](https://suttacentral.net/mn36/en/sujato).

[^499]: This verse appears to be corrupt. The sense can be restored
    through two extra lines in the Sanskrit: "Ethics, immersion,
    conduct, and knowledge, and unification of mind have been developed
    by me, teacher of the references for the noble teaching." \| For
    *padesavattī*, the Sanskrit has
    *pradeśavaktā*, where *vaktā* means
    "speaker" and *pradeśa* has the sense "pointing out". I
    think it means, "I am the one who taught the four great references
    (*mahāpadesa*)".

[^500]: The commentary says this line was added at the Council.

[^501]: This is similar to the idea of the Four Great references, and
    sets the scene for the First Council at which the teachings were
    recited. \| *Paññatto* here means "pointed out" rather
    than "laid down", as can be seen from [DN
    9:33.21](https://suttacentral.net/dn9/en/sujato#33.21), where the
    same phrase refers to the four noble truths.

[^502]: *Āvuso* is from the root *āyu* ("age") and thus has
    a respectful sense and does not mean "friend" as it is often
    translated. Like *bhante*, it is an indeclinable vocative of address
    that may be used with or without the name (see eg. [MN
    5:31.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn5/en/sujato#31.2)).

[^503]: I render *bhante* as "sir" when it stands alone and "honorable"
    when it prefixes a name. \| Unlike *bhante*, *āyasmā*
    ("venerable") is declinable, so it is used in parts of speech other
    than direct address. It is from the same root as
    *āvuso* but with a slightly more respectful tone,
    perhaps because it sounds more Sanskritic.

[^504]: These are not defined here, and the senior monks at the First
    Council were unable to agree on them ([Kd
    21:1.9.3](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd21/en/sujato#1.9.3)).
    Nonetheless, the Pali Vinaya consistently labels the
    Pācittiya rules as "lesser" (*khuddaka*; [Bu Pc
    92:2.2.22](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc92/en/sujato#2.2.22),
    [Bi Pc
    96:2.2.22](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc96/en/sujato#2.2.22),
    [Pvr
    1.1:219.3](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr1.1/en/sujato#219.3)),
    which would make the Pātidesanīyas "minor"
    (*anukhuddaka*). The Sekhiya rules are also "minor", but they were
    not at this point reckoned among the training rules for recitation.

[^505]: "Divine punishment" is *brahmadaṇḍa*. Channa
    features often in the Vinaya as a monk who refuses correction and
    acts disrespectfully. The Sangha had already imposed an act of
    "ejection" (*ukkhepanīyakamma*) on him due to his
    persistent bad behavior, but that was still not enough ([Kd
    1:25.1.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#25.1.1)).
    The *brahmadaṇḍa* was imposed at the First Council ([Kd
    1:1.12.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#1.12.1)),
    upon which Channa finally saw the error of his ways.
    *Brahmadaṇḍa* is encountered in a different sense at
    [DN 3:1.23.21](https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato#1.23.21).

[^506]: *Vattabba* in such contexts means "advise, correct" rather than
    more generally "speak to". Thus the *brahmadaṇḍa* is
    not the "silent treatment".

[^507]: The commentary says this line was added at the Council.

[^508]: Even on his deathbed, the Buddha retains mastery over his mind.

[^509]: Following the commentary, which reads this as a question.
    Anuruddha was renowned for his psychic powers. Note that Ānanda and
    Anuruddha have immediately adopted the forms of address recommended
    by the Buddha above.

[^510]: Each of these characters reveal something of themselves in their
    verses. Sahampati, as a royal deity, emphasizes the universal nature
    of the teaching and the grandeur of the Buddha.

[^511]: "Bag of bones" is a loose rendering of *samussaya*.

[^512]: Less creative than Brahmā, Sakka repeats a famous
    verse spoken by the Buddha at [SN
    15.20:8.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn15.20/en/sujato#8.1) and [DN
    17:2.17.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato#2.17.5).

[^513]: Anuruddha was a reclusive meditator who specialized in
    mindfulness of breathing.

[^514]: Ānanda has the most emotional reaction. While Anuruddha speaks
    only of peace, Ānanda empathizes with those who were distraught.

[^515]: Text omits "with hair disheveled" (*kese pakiriya*) when
    describing the shaven-headed monks.

[^516]: "Still on the same business" (*teneva karaṇīyena*)
    calls back to [DN
    16:5.20.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#5.20.1), where
    they were said to be "on some business" (*kenacideva
    karaṇīyena*). They had been discussing all night.

[^517]: An uplifting response to tragedy, full of beauty and
    celebration.

[^518]: It seem unlikely that everyone simply forgot. It was probably
    the custom to wait seven days before the cremation.

[^519]: "Unworn" is *ahata*, as at [DN
    14:1.33.9](https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#1.33.9) and [Kd
    1:1.6.2](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#1.6.2).

[^520]: "Coronation" is *makuṭabandhana*, "the binding of
    the crown". The commentary says there was, fittingly, an auspicious
    decorative royal hall there; perhaps too the name was felt to pun
    with *muktabandhana*, "freedom from ties".

[^521]: I think *sandhi* here means "covered without gaps".

[^522]: With the passing of Sāriputta and
    Moggallāna, Mahākassapa was the most
    senior of the remaining leading mendicants. As a solitary recluse,
    it was unusual for him to be travelling with such a large group, or
    with anyone at all really. He was to cite the events depicted here
    at the start of the First Council ([Kd
    1:1.1.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#1.1.1)).

[^523]: A follower of the Bamboo-staffed Ascetic Gosāla
    ([DN 2:19.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#19.1)). \| This
    may be an inspiration for the so-called "Flower Sermon", a medieval
    Zen story that depicts the Buddha holding up a flower and
    Mahakassapa smiling.

[^524]: Compare [Bu Pc
    72](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc72/en/sujato). The
    syntax is clumsy here, perhaps deliberately so.

[^525]: Here *sarīrāneva* is plural and so must mean
    "relics", whereas previously it was singular, "corpse".

[^526]: As when he was born ([DN
    14:1.28.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#1.28.1)).

[^527]: Ajātasattu would have learned of the news from
    spies. It is a 600 km round trip to Rājagaha and back,
    which a mounted messenger could make in fourteen days.

[^528]: A bold move, considering that his designs on the Vajjis were no
    secret. Perhaps he was seeking a pretext for war. The justification
    for taking a share of relics is caste, rather than practice of the
    Dhamma.

[^529]: Both the tribe and the town are exceedingly obscure, mentioned
    nowhere else in early texts. They must have been a small clan
    nearby.

[^530]: The Koliyans were south-eastern neighbors of the Sakyans, and
    several of their towns and people feature in the early texts.

[^531]: This brahmin is mentioned nowhere else.

[^532]: *Dassāma* ("we shall give") is the future second
    plural of *dadati*.

[^533]: The brahmin Doṇa appears suddenly in the narrative,
    a reminder that there were many more people than the ones who are
    mentioned. The suttas record two encounters with a brahmin of this
    name: one is the wondrous story of seeing the Buddhas footprints
    ([AN 4.36](https://suttacentral.net/an4.36/en/sujato)), while the
    other discusses the five kinds of brahmin ([AN
    5.192](https://suttacentral.net/an5.192/en/sujato)).

[^534]: The fear of war was justified and the resolution achieved by
    Doṇa probably marks the last time these parties
    achieved a diplomatic outcome. The relative peace that had lasted
    most of the Buddha's life was crumbling. We hear of war or threats
    of war between the Kosalans and the Magadhans, the Magadhans and the
    Vajjis, the Sakyans and the Koliyans, the Kosalans and the Mallas,
    and the Kosalans and the Sakyans. It is probably because of the
    latter two conflicts that Viḍūḍabha---Pasenadi's son
    and the newly crowned king of Kosala---did not send an emissary to
    the funeral. By sparking conflicts with former allies the Sakyans
    and Mallas, Viḍūḍabha undid the successes of his father
    and fatally weakened the Kosalan Empire. When the dust cleared a few
    decades later, all these lands had been consumed by Magadha.

[^535]: Thus begins the practice of establishing Buddhism by interring
    relics in a stupa.

[^536]: The Moriyas were a minor clan of the region, unmentioned outside
    of this passage, but their obscurity was not to last long. About a
    century after these events, Chandragupta the Moriyan, having won the
    Magadhan crown from the Nandas, proceeded to route the Greeks in the
    west. His empire, which covered most of northern India, was further
    expanded to the south by his son Bindusara and grandson Ashoka,
    under whom the Mauryan Empire became the greatest of all Indian
    empires. Thus Ajātasattu's expansionist dreams were
    ultimately fulfilled beyond his imagining.

[^537]: The commentary says this summary was added at the Council.
