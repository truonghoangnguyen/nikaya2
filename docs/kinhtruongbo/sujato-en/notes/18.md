[^578]: This picks up from the events of [DN
    16:2.5.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#2.5.1), which
    however discusses only the Ñātikans (who are reckoned
    among the Vajjis). Like [DN
    17](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato), it bears many signs of
    a late sutta. The overall theme is the presence of a cosmic order
    where the liberating teaching of the Buddha is reconciled with the
    requirements of worldly power.

[^579]: This list of ten nations is unique. The omission of the
    Aṅgas and Magadhans is noted below. The more famous
    list of "sixteen nations" adds Avanti and Assaka in the south, and
    Gandhāra and Kamboja in the north-west (eg. [AN
    3.70:28.3](https://suttacentral.net/an3.70/en/sujato#28.3)). The
    Buddha did not visit these lands, which explains why they are
    omitted.

[^580]: "Devotees" is *paricāraka*, which normally means
    "servant". It is not in the relevant passages of DN 16. This sense
    is found in only a couple of other places, both late ([Snp
    5.18:1.2](https://suttacentral.net/snp5.18/en/sujato#1.2), [Kd
    1:22.14.8](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#22.14.8)).

[^581]: Bearing in mind that none of the nations were actually mentioned
    in the relevant Mahāparinibbānasutta passage, this
    whole introduction is framed to emphasize the importance of Magadha
    to Buddhism, especially given the problematic character of
    Ajātasattu. In the decades following the Buddha's
    death, the Buddhist community adapted to a new political landscape
    which for a time saw the entirety of Buddhism contained within the
    sprawling Magadhan empire.

[^582]: As we known from [DN 2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato),
    Bimbisāra had recently been murdered by
    Ajātasattu.

[^583]: A not-so-subtle hint of the changes under
    Ajātasattu. The passing of Bimbisāra
    signifies the crumbling of the social order that prevailed in the
    Buddha's lifetime, bringing with it the immediate threat of war and
    chaos. This sutta establishes a timeless order that persists while
    worldly conditions fluctuate.

[^584]: Elsewhere the suttas say that Bimbisāra went for
    refuge ([DN 4:6.33](https://suttacentral.net/dn4/en/sujato#6.33)),
    while the Vinaya says he was in fact a stream-enterer ([Kd
    1:22.9.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#22.9.1)),
    which is confirmed below. The Jains, however, claim him as one of
    their own but say he went to hell for committing suicide. Like his
    son Ajātasattu, it is likely that he frequented several
    teachers in his realm.

[^585]: Near the town of Uruvelā on the bank of the
    Nerañjarā River at the place known today as Bodhgaya.

[^586]: "Suggestion" is *parikathaṁ*, which elsewhere
    occurs in the Vinaya ([Kd
    7:1.5.16](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd7/en/sujato#1.5.16)) and
    the Abhidhamma Vibhaṅga ([Vb
    17:43.2](https://suttacentral.net/vb17/en/sujato#43.2)) in the sense
    of "hint".

[^587]: Normally *aṭṭhiṁ katvā
    manasikatvā sabbaṁ cetasā
    samannāharitvā* describes listening to Dhamma. This
    whole process seems unusually laborious.

[^588]: *Nāmadheyyaṁ* means "name (borne by someone or
    something)", not "one who bears the name" ([MN
    50:22.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn50/en/sujato#22.1)).

[^589]: *Janavasabha* is "chief of men", spelled *janesabha* at [DN
    20:10.10](https://suttacentral.net/dn20/en/sujato#10.10) and [DN
    32:10.9](https://suttacentral.net/dn32/en/sujato#10.9). The synonym
    *narāsabha* is an occasional poetic epithet of the
    Buddha ([Snp
    3.11:6.2](https://suttacentral.net/snp3.11/en/sujato#6.2), [Snp
    5.1:21.3](https://suttacentral.net/snp5.1/en/sujato#21.3), [SN
    11.3:14.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn11.3/en/sujato#14.2)). In
    Sanskrit we find *puruṣaṛṣabha* in the same sense.

[^590]: *Uḷāravaṇṇa* describes beautiful people at [MN
    96:7.8](https://suttacentral.net/mn96/en/sujato#7.8).

[^591]: Read *ito*. I think this implies what is stated more explicitly
    in Anuruddha's partly parallel verses at [Thag
    16.9:23.1](https://suttacentral.net/thag16.9/en/sujato#23.1): after
    each of seven rebirths under Vessavaṇa he can become a
    king of men. This explains the name Janavasabha.

[^592]: It is rare to see *saṁsāra* used as a countable
    noun, but see [Thag
    2.48:2.2](https://suttacentral.net/thag2.48/en/sujato#2.2).

[^593]: As a stream-enterer he is freed from any lower rebirths, yet he
    still aspires to a higher realization.

[^594]: In this idiom, the verb for "aware" varies between
    *sañjānāti*, *jānāti*,
    *pajānāti*, and *sampajānāti*.

[^595]: Compare [SN
    1.50:5.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn1.50/en/sujato#5.1) and [SN
    2.24:6.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn2.24/en/sujato#6.1).

[^596]: It is not just the Vajjis and the Buddhist Saṅgha
    who meet frequently in a hall to discuss business, but the gods as
    well. Here we get a rare glimpse into how the heavens work, or more
    to the point, how depictions of heavenly proceedings act as a
    template for how things should be on earth.

[^597]: The thirty-three and the Four Great Kings are both present; the
    heavenly realms are not shut off from one another.

[^598]: For *vipakkamati* compare [MN
    127:11.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn127/en/sujato#11.1).

[^599]: Compare [DN
    11:80.12](https://suttacentral.net/dn11/en/sujato#80.12).

[^600]: For *vipāko bhavissati* in discerning the results
    of signs, compare [DN
    1:1.24.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#1.24.2).

[^601]: See [AN
    3.127:2.3](https://suttacentral.net/an3.127/en/sujato#2.3).

[^602]: This phrase is also at [DN
    19:16.8](https://suttacentral.net/dn19/en/sujato#16.8), but apart
    from that the words *pakativaṇṇa* ("normal
    appearance"), *anabhisambhavanīya* ("imperceptible"),
    and *cakkhupatha* ("visual range") are all unique in the early
    texts.

[^603]: For the unique term "human form" (*mānusaṁ
    viggahaṁ*) compare the Vinaya phrase
    *manussaviggahaṁ* ([Bu Pj
    3:2.49.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3/en/sujato#2.49.1)).

[^604]: Also appearing in [DN
    21:1.8.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn21/en/sujato#1.8.3), [DN
    20:10.11](https://suttacentral.net/dn20/en/sujato#10.11), and [SN
    35.119](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.119/en/sujato),
    Pañcasikha ("Five-Crest") was a handsome and virile
    deity of the *gandhabbas*.

[^605]: *Bhāsittha* is 3rd singular aorist middle voice.

[^606]: Compare [MN
    91:21.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn91/en/sujato#21.4).

[^607]: Everything Sanaṅkumāra says is just a bit off. Here
    he adopts an idiom commonly used by the Buddha, but in third person
    rather than the Buddha's second person; and he asks only
    rhetorically, where the Buddha engages with his audience. If it were
    only this one example it would mean nothing, but similar changes
    happen throughout. I believe this is a subtle literary device that
    tells two narratives to two audiences. To potential converts it
    sounds like Sanaṅkumāra is giving a ringing and learned
    endorsement of Buddhism, while to knowledgeable Buddhists he appears
    as less than well versed in the teachings. I note these eccentric
    wordings as we proceed.

[^608]: The sutta began by recounting those who have achieved various
    stages of awakening. But escape from rebirth threatens the gods;
    this potentially fraught relationship is played out in [MN
    49](https://suttacentral.net/mn49/en/sujato).
    Sanaṅkumāra is preempting such arguments by pointing
    out that many of the Buddha's followers are reborn among the gods
    and do not escape transmigration, at least not for now. This is no
    trivial metaphysical argument. In order for Buddhism to prevail, it
    must show that its radical soteriology is compatible with worldly
    prosperity, lest it face opposition from kings and other temporal
    powers. The gods act as proxies to demonstrate the appropriate
    behavior for terrestrial kings. This is why the leading character is
    Bimbisāra/Janavasabha, who straddles the two realms.

[^609]: Sanaṅkumāra begins sharing the Buddha's teaching
    with the gods, starting with the bases of psychic power that
    featured prominently in DN 16. Here, however, he focuses on the
    worldly dimensions of psychic powers, ignoring the liberating
    dimension that was central to the Buddha. This sets the pattern for
    the teachings to follow, except for the very last.

[^610]: *Yāva supaññattā*, which is also at
    [MN 51:4.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn51/en/sujato#4.3), is a
    variation of the common exclamation *yāva
    subhāsita*. The phrase *iddhipahutāya
    iddhivisavitāya iddhivikubbanatāya* is
    unique. The Paṭisambhidāmagga draws on this passage to
    explain *vikubbana* both as a general term for development of
    psychic powers ([Ps
    3.2:4.3](https://suttacentral.net/ps3.2/en/sujato#4.3)) and as
    specific kind of psychic power, namely the transformation of one's
    apparent form as demonstrated by Sanaṅkumāra ([Ps
    3.2:15.1](https://suttacentral.net/ps3.2/en/sujato#15.1)).

[^611]: These "three opportunities" are not found elsewhere.

[^612]: This unique term is the reverse of the phrase that begins the
    first *jhāna*. The passage, however, speaks only of
    lifestyle rather than deep meditation.

[^613]: "Aloof" (*asaṁsaṭṭha*) is a synonym of "secluded"
    (*vivicca*). The *jhāna* formulas are extremely stable
    and it is rare to find them played with like this.

[^614]: Since *jhāna* arises from pleasure, it cannot be
    meant here.

[^615]: "Coarse physical, verbal, and mental processes"
    (*oḷārikā kāyasaṅkhārā
    ...vacīsaṅkhārā ... cittasaṅkhārā*) is
    another unique term. They are probably to be identified with the
    three "processes" of [MN
    44:14.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn44/en/sujato#14.2).

[^616]: This builds off [DN
    1:2.24.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#2.24.1), but the
    full phrase is only here and [DN
    19:7.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn19/en/sujato#7.2).

[^617]: Normally *satipaṭṭhāna* is taught "in order to
    purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an
    end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to
    realize extinguishment" (eg. [DN
    22:1.7](https://suttacentral.net/dn22/en/sujato#1.7)). Here, in yet
    another unique phrasing, a more humble goal is sought.

[^618]: Again the liberating dimension is ignored in favor of worldly
    psychic abilities. This is another unique formulation.

[^619]: Also found at [AN
    7.45:1.1](https://suttacentral.net/an7.45/en/sujato#1.1). At [MN
    44:12.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn44/en/sujato#12.4) the four
    right efforts are said to be the "prerequisites of immersion". Here
    at last Sanaṅkumāra introduces the liberating dimension
    of the path as a whole.

[^620]: Also at [SN 45.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.1/en/sujato),
    etc.

[^621]: To the standard passage on the qualities of the Dhamma,
    Sanaṅkumāra clumsily tacks on the line spoken by the
    Buddha when he was persuaded by Brahmā to teach ([SN
    6.1:10.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn6.1/en/sujato#10.1), [DN
    14:3.7.13](https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#3.7.13), [MN
    26:21.6](https://suttacentral.net/mn26/en/sujato#21.6), [MN
    85:45.6](https://suttacentral.net/mn85/en/sujato#45.6)).

[^622]: Finally the question is answered, although the number of deaths
    is obviously exaggerated. We cannot estimate the population size at
    the time with any confidence. But we know that
    Pāṭaliputta under Ashoka covered about 25 km², which
    suggests a population somewhere around 250,000. Probably there were
    a few million people in the whole of Magadha.

[^623]: The commentary identifies these as non-returners, but this is
    unlikely as *puññābhāga* ("share of merit") indicates
    those who do good for the sake of a good rebirth rather than
    liberation ([AN
    6.63:30.2](https://suttacentral.net/an6.63/en/sujato#30.2)). There
    would have been countless more of such good folk than
    stream-enterers, whereas the number of non-returners, as indicated
    by the count of the Ñātikans, would have been small,
    not "countless". This verse is also at [SN
    6.13:7.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn6.13/en/sujato#7.1), where the
    commentary says nothing of non-returners.

[^624]: Sanaṅkumāra lives longer than the lesser gods so he
    has a broader perspective. He emphasizes the long-term stability of
    cosmic order, which prevails through the crises that afflict the
    short-lived kingdoms of men.

[^625]: Astonishingly, this sutta traces its textual lineage directly to
    Brahmā, exactly like the Brahmanical texts (eg.
    Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.5.4). Of course,
    Brahmā gets his teaching from the Buddha, but this is
    clearly copying the Brahmanical model.

[^626]: Here Ānanda plays a key role as the linchpin of the oral
    tradition. It is likely that not just the
    Mahāparinibbānasutta itself, but all these suttas of
    this cycle were composed by Ānanda or his students.

[^627]: With this unique ending, there is no claim that this sutta was
    heard by the mendicants in the usual way. Rather it makes its
    purpose explicit, to act as a means to widely propagate the Dhamma.
    The Mahāparinibbānasutta also speaks of the spread of
    the Dhamma, and the Janavasabhasutta indicates some of the means by
    which that was achieved in the decades following the Buddha's death;
    in particular, by allying itself with the ascendant power of
    Magadha.
