[^318]: This discourse picks up from [DN
    29:17.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato#17.1), where the
    Buddha urges that the Sangha should gather and recite the Dhamma for
    the long lasting of the dispensation. There he lists the 37 factors
    of awakening, a standard early collation of practice-oriented
    teachings that are primarily collected in the Mahāvagga
    of the Saṁyutta Nikāya. This discourse is
    a late one, and appears to be an initial attempt to compile a more
    thorough list of the Buddha's teachings. The
    Sarvāstivāda version of the same discourse formed the
    basis of one of their seven Abhidhamma books, the
    Sangītiparyāya.

[^319]: At [AN 10.176](https://suttacentral.net/an10.176/en/sujato)
    Cunda asks about the purity of the western brahmins; at [DN
    16:4.13.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#4.13.5) = [Ud
    8.5](https://suttacentral.net/ud8.5/en/sujato) he offers the
    Buddha's last meal; at [Snp
    1.5](https://suttacentral.net/snp1.5/en/sujato) he asks about a true
    ascetic.

[^320]: The completion of a town hall was celebrated by a talk for the
    Sakyans [SN
    35.243:1.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.243/en/sujato#1.2) and [MN
    53:2.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn53/en/sujato#2.1). Such halls
    were community meeting places that played a central role in civic
    society and communal decision-making in democratic republics such as
    the Mallas and the Sakyans. The Buddha's participation is a sign of
    his support for their civic and democratic process.

[^321]: As at [DN
    16:5.19.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#5.19.2), the
    Mallas are called Vāseṭṭhas after the family lineage of
    their priest (*purohita*).

[^322]: The Buddha likewise mentions his bad back and invites another
    monk to teach in both the other suttas where he is first to teach in
    a new hall ([MN
    53:5.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn53/en/sujato#5.3), [SN
    35.243:3.4](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.243/en/sujato#3.4)), and
    also on the *uposatha* at Naḷakapāna ([AN
    10.67](https://suttacentral.net/an10.67/en/sujato), [AN
    10.68](https://suttacentral.net/an10.68/en/sujato)). These were all
    occasions when the community was sitting late into the night.

[^323]: As at [DN 29:1.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato#1.3)
    and [MN 104:2.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn104/en/sujato#2.1), in
    both of which the Buddha was in the Sakyan lands at this time.
    There, the news is conveyed to the Buddha by the novice Cunda.
    Perhaps he was confused with Cunda the smith.

[^324]: Sāriputta adopts the "Aṅguttara
    principle" of arranging teachings by number rather than the
    "Saṁyutta principle" of arrangement by topic. Thus this
    list of teachings has more in common with the Aṅguttara
    Nikāya than with the Buddha's original list of
    Saṁyutta topics. I note unusual or rare terms, but the
    references here are meant to be indicative rather than
    comprehensive.

    10.27:10.5](https://suttacentral.net/an10.27/en/sujato#10.5), [AN

    4:1.2](https://suttacentral.net/kp4/en/sujato#1.2).

[^326]: This phrase is unique, but here *saṅkhārā*
    ("conditions") is a synonym of *āhāra* ("food, fuel,
    nutriment").

[^327]: The paucity of teachings of "one" reflects the fact that the
    Aṅguttara Nikāya Ones consists mostly of
    longer teachings that have been split into atoms to artificially
    create "ones".

    opposite ([SN 45.21](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.21/en/sujato).
    "Surety in the right way" is mentioned often (eg. [AN

    "heaps".

    refers to material phenomena perceivable by the eye. "Invisible and
    resistant" is a shorthand for material phenomena that are not
    perceivable by the eye, but which nonetheless impinge on other
    senses, such as sounds or smells. "Invisible and non-resistant"
    includes form perceived solely in the mind.

[^346]: The last item is elsewhere found only in Abhidhamma texts. A
    "trainee" is a noble one who has at least entered the path to
    stream-entry; an "adept" (*asekkha*) has completed their training;
    one who is neither is yet to begin.

[^356]: This threefold presentation of the process of absorption focuses
    on *vitakka* ("placing the mind") and *vicāra*
    ("keeping it connected"), looking closely at how they cease (see
    also [DN 34:1.4.7](https://suttacentral.net/dn34/en/sujato#1.4.7),
    [MN 128:31.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn128/en/sujato#31.4), [SN

    8.63:3.1](https://suttacentral.net/an8.63/en/sujato#3.1)). The
    standard *jhāna* formula focuses more on the refinement
    of feelings, from which perspective the first two stages of
    immersion here fall under the "rapture and bliss born of seclusion",
    while only the third qualifies as "rapture and bliss born of
    immersion". Thus Analayo describes the two descriptions' as
    "complementary perspectives on the same process of deepening
    concentration" (*Comparative Study*, vol. ii, pg. 739, note 263).

[^397]: [AN 4.198](https://suttacentral.net/an4.198/en/sujato). \| "With
    self become divine" (*brahmabhūtena

    language. Pali is sometimes said to lack reference to the cosmic
    Brahman (in neuter), having only the personal Brahmā
    (in masculine). The grammatical case of *brahma-* in the compound
    here is undetermined, yet no scholar of Sanskrit would hesitate to
    interpret the common phrase *brahmabhūtātmā* in the
    sense "self become one with the cosmic divinity Brahman". Surely the

[^422]: In [AN 6.57](https://suttacentral.net/an6.57/en/sujato) this is
    a response to the doctrine of Pūraṇa Kassapa.

[^423]: At [AN 6.142](https://suttacentral.net/an6.142/en/sujato) and
    [AN 6.35](https://suttacentral.net/an6.35/en/sujato), but not called
    "perceptions that help penetration".

[^424]: *Ariyadhana* appears to be constructed after
    *ācariyadhana*, "a teacher's fee", and hence *ariya*
    here would be a noun rather than verb.

[^428]: At [AN 7.68](https://suttacentral.net/an7.68/en/sujato) *dhamma*
    in this context is shown to be "teachings", not "qualities".

[^430]: At [AN 7.616](https://suttacentral.net/an7.616/en/sujato), but
    not called "seven perceptions".

[^432]: [AN 7.44](https://suttacentral.net/an7.44/en/sujato).

[^433]: Primarily a Vinaya topic ([Kd
    14:14.16.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd14/en/sujato#14.16.1)),
    but also found at [AN
    7.84](https://suttacentral.net/an7.84/en/sujato) and explained at
    [MN 104:13.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn104/en/sujato#13.1).

[^434]: This and the next at [AN
    8.80](https://suttacentral.net/an8.80/en/sujato).

[^435]: These are just called "gifts" at [AN
    8.31](https://suttacentral.net/an8.31/en/sujato). The "reasons to
    give" at [AN 8.33](https://suttacentral.net/an8.33/en/sujato) are
    different.

[^436]: See [MN 120:3.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn120/en/sujato#3.4)
    and [AN 8.35:1.8](https://suttacentral.net/an8.35/en/sujato#1.8).

[^437]: "Settled for less" also occurs at [AN
    8.35:1.9](https://suttacentral.net/an8.35/en/sujato#1.9). Readings
    vary between *hīne vimuttaṁ* ("released in
    what is inferior", per MS) and *hīne
    'dhimuttaṁ* ("resolved upon what is inferior"). This is
    an example of an ambiguity between *vi + √muc* ("release") and
    *adhi + √muc* ("resolve") that is sometimes seen in Pali texts. The
    subcommentary reads *vimuttaṁ* and offers two
    explanations: "'Released' (*vimuttaṁ*) means 'resolved'
    (*adhimuttaṁ*); the meaning is slants, slopes, and
    inclines. Or else 'released' means 'set free'
    (*vissaṭṭhaṁ*)." Given that it is clearly accepted in
    the commentarial tradition, and that it is the more difficult
    reading, it seems we must accept *vimuttaṁ* as the
    correct reading here. But from context, and from the subcommentary,
    it has the same sense as *adhimutta*, namely, "resolved upon". This
    goes some way to explaining the ambiguity between the two words, as
    they not only have a similar form, but their meanings can overlap
    too.

[^438]: Notice that they have "seen" the well-to-do brahmins or
    aristocrats, but have only "heard of" the various deities.

[^439]: Previous rebirths required only ethics. Rebirth in the
    Brahmā realm, however, requires the freedom of the mind
    from hindrances through practicing absorption.

[^447]: Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.3.10 warns
    that, because the knowledge of the gods have not reached them, the
    lands beyond the borders are the domain of death.

[^448]: Eight at [AN 8.29](https://suttacentral.net/an8.29/en/sujato)
    and [DN
    34:2.1.122](https://suttacentral.net/dn34/en/sujato#2.1.122); the
    ninth here is made by adding the *asura* rebirth.

[^450]: [AN 9.61](https://suttacentral.net/an9.61/en/sujato).

[^451]: The pre-Buddhist sense of *sati* is "memory", while
    "mindfulness" evolved from the practice of "remembering" scripture,
    creating an uninterrupted flow state in the present. In this sense,
    mindfulness can be understood as the element of continuity that
    knits consciousness together in a coherent stream. Thus when
    practicing "mindfulness of breathing" one pays continuous attention
    to the breaths, not "forgetting" what one is doing.

[^453]: [AN 10.25](https://suttacentral.net/an10.25/en/sujato).
    *Kaṣina* means "universal", "totality", and it refers
    to a measureless state of *jhāna*. In later usage it
    became a term for a physical object, such as a disk, on which a
    meditator focused, but it never has this meaning in early texts.
    Yājñavalkya says that, just as salt is "entirely"
    salty, the Self is an "entire mass of consciousness"
    (*kṛtsnaḥ prajñānaghana eva*,
    Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.5.13).
