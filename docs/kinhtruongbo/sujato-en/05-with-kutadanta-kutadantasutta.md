# With Kūṭadanta

_**Kūṭadantasutta**_

## 1. The Brahmins and Householders of Khāṇumata

[So I have heard.[^403]]{.smallcaps} At one time the Buddha was
wandering in the land of the Magadhans together with a large
Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a
village of the Magadhan brahmins named Khāṇumata.[^404]
There he stayed nearby at Ambalaṭṭhikā.[^405]

Now at that time the brahmin Kūṭadanta was living in
Khāṇumata. It was a crown property given by King Seniya
Bimbisāra of Magadha, teeming with living creatures, full
of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin.[^406]
Now at that time Kūṭadanta had prepared a great sacrifice.
Bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats and rams---seven hundred of each---had
been led to the post for the sacrifice.[^407]

The brahmins and householders of Khāṇumata heard:

"It seems the ascetic Gotama---a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan
family---has arrived at Khāṇumata and is staying at
Ambalaṭṭhikā. He has this good reputation: 'That Blessed
One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and
conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to
train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.' He has realized
with his own insight this world---with its gods, Māras, and
divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and
humans---and he makes it known to others. He proclaims a teaching that
is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end,
meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that's
entirely full and pure. It's good to see such perfected ones."

Then, having departed Khāṇumata, they formed into companies
and headed to Ambalaṭṭhikā.

Now at that time the brahmin Kūṭadanta had retired to the
upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday nap. He saw the
brahmins and householders heading for Ambalaṭṭhikā, and
addressed his butler, "My butler, why are the brahmins and householders
headed for Ambalaṭṭhikā?"

"The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Khāṇumata and is staying
at Ambalaṭṭhikā. He has this good reputation: 'That Blessed
One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and
conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to
train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.' They're going to
see that Mister Gotama."

Then Kūṭadanta thought, "I've heard that the ascetic Gotama
knows how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen
accessories.[^408] I don't know about that, but I wish to perform a
great sacrifice. Why don't I ask him how to accomplish the sacrifice
with three modes and sixteen accessories?"[^409]

Then Kūṭadanta addressed his butler, "Well then, go to the
brahmins and householders and say to them: 'Sirs, the brahmin
Kūṭadanta asks you to wait, as he will also go to see the
ascetic Gotama.'"

"Yes, sir," replied the butler, and did as he was asked.

## 2. The Qualities of Kūṭadanta

Now at that time several hundred brahmins were residing in
Khāṇumata thinking to participate in
Kūṭadanta's sacrifice. They heard that
Kūṭadanta was going to see the ascetic Gotama. They
approached Kūṭadanta and said to him:

"Is it really true that you are going to see the ascetic Gotama?"

"Yes, gentlemen, it is true."

"Please don't! It's not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic
Gotama. For if you do so, your reputation will diminish and his will
increase. For this reason it's not appropriate for you to go to see the
ascetic Gotama; it's appropriate that he comes to see you.

You are well born on both your mother's and father's side, of pure
descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh
paternal generation. For this reason it's not appropriate for you to go
to see the ascetic Gotama; it's appropriate that he comes to see you.

You're rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of property and assets,
and lots of money and grain ...

You recite and remember the hymns, and have mastered the three Vedas,
together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology
and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. You know them
word-by-word, and their grammar. You are well versed in cosmology and
the marks of a great man. ...

You are attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. You are
magnificent and splendid as the Divinity, remarkable to behold. ...

You are ethical, mature in ethical conduct. ...

You're a good speaker who enunciates well, with a polished, clear, and
articulate voice that expresses the meaning. ...

You teach the tutors of many, and teach three hundred young students to
recite the hymns. Many students come from various districts and
countries for the sake of the hymns, wishing to learn the hymns. ...

You're old, elderly and senior, advanced in years, and have reached the
final stage of life. The ascetic Gotama is young, and has newly gone
forth. ...

You're honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by King
Bimbisāra of Magadha ...

and the brahmin Pokkharasāti. ...

You live in Khāṇumata, a crown property given by King
Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, teeming with living creatures,
full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin.
For this reason it's not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic
Gotama; it's appropriate that he comes to see you."

## 3. The Qualities of the Buddha

When they had spoken, Kūṭadanta said to those brahmins:

"Well then, gentlemen, listen to why it's appropriate for me to go to
see the ascetic Gotama, and it's not appropriate for him to come to see
me. He is well born on both his mother's and father's side, of pure
descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh
paternal generation. For this reason it's not appropriate for the
ascetic Gotama to come to see me; rather, it's appropriate for me to go
to see him.

When he went forth he abandoned a large family circle. ...

When he went forth he abandoned abundant gold, both coined and uncoined,
stored in dungeons and towers. ...

He went forth from the lay life to homelessness while still a youth,
young, with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of
life. ...

Though his mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful
faces, he shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and
went forth from the lay life to homelessness. ...

He is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. He is
magnificent and splendid as the Divinity, remarkable to behold. ...

He is ethical, possessing ethical conduct that is noble and skillful.
...

He's a good speaker who enunciates well, with a polished, clear, and
articulate voice that expresses the meaning. ...

He's a tutor of tutors. ...

He has ended sensual desire, and is rid of caprice. ...

He teaches the efficacy of deeds and action. He doesn't wish any harm
upon the community of brahmins. ...

He went forth from an eminent family of unbroken aristocratic lineage.
...

He went forth from a rich, affluent, and wealthy family. ...

People come from distant lands and distant countries to question him.
...

Many thousands of deities have gone for refuge for life to him. ...

He has this good reputation: 'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully
awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of
the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods
and humans, awakened, blessed.' ...

He has the thirty-two marks of a great man. ...

He is welcoming, congenial, polite, smiling, open, the first to speak.
...

He's honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by the four
assemblies. ...

Many gods and humans are devoted to him. ...

While he is residing in a village or town, non-human entities do not
harass them. ...

He leads an order and a community, and tutors a community, and is said
to be the best of the various religious founders. He didn't come by his
fame in the same ways as those other ascetics and brahmins. Rather, he
came by his fame due to his supreme knowledge and conduct. ...

King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and his wives and children
have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama. ...

King Pasenadi of Kosala and his wives and children have gone for refuge
for life to the ascetic Gotama. ...

The brahmin Pokkharasāti and his wives and children have
gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama. ...

He's honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by King
Bimbisāra of Magadha ...

King Pasenadi of Kosala ...

and the brahmin Pokkharasāti.

The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Khāṇumata and is staying
at Ambalaṭṭhikā. Any ascetic or brahmin who comes to stay
in our village district is our guest, and should be honored and
respected as such. For this reason, too, it's not appropriate for Mister
Gotama to come to see me, rather, it's appropriate for me to go to see
him. This is the extent of Mister Gotama's praise that I have memorized.
But his praises are not confined to this, for the praise of Mister
Gotama is limitless."

When he had spoken, those brahmins said to him, "According to
Kūṭadanta's praises, if Mister Gotama were staying within a
hundred leagues, it'd be worthwhile for a faithful gentleman to go to
see him, even if he had to carry his own provisions in a knapsack."

"Well then, gentlemen, let's all go to see the ascetic Gotama."

## 4. The Story of King Mahāvijita's Sacrifice

Then Kūṭadanta together with a large group of brahmins went
to see the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings
and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Before
sitting down to one side, some of the brahmins and householders of
Khāṇumata bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite
conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some
announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.

Kūṭadanta said to the Buddha, "Mister Gotama, I've heard
that you know how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and
sixteen accessories. I don't know about that, but I wish to perform a
great sacrifice. Please teach me how to accomplish the sacrifice with
three modes and sixteen accessories."

"Well then, brahmin, listen and apply your mind well, I will
speak."[^410]

"Yes sir," Kūṭadanta replied. The Buddha said this: "Once
upon a time, brahmin, there was a king named Mahāvijita. He
was rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of
property and assets, lots of money and grain, and a full treasury and
storehouses.[^411] Then as King Mahāvijita was in private
retreat this thought came to his mind:[^412] 'I have achieved human
wealth, and reign after conquering this vast territory. Why don't I hold
a large sacrifice? That will be for my lasting welfare and
happiness.'[^413]

Then he summoned the brahmin high priest and said to him:[^414] 'Just
now, brahmin, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind, "I
have achieved human wealth, and reign after conquering this vast
territory. Why don't I perform a great sacrifice? That will be for my
lasting welfare and happiness." Brahmin, I wish to perform a great
sacrifice. Please instruct me. It will be for my lasting welfare and
happiness.'

When he had spoken, the brahmin high priest said to him: 'Sir, the
king's realm is harried and oppressed. Raiding of villages, towns, and
cities has been seen, and infesting of highways.[^415] But if the king
were to extract more taxes while his realm is thus harried and
oppressed, he would not be doing his duty.[^416]

Now the king might think, "I'll eradicate this plague of savages by
execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or
banishment!" But that's not the right way to eradicate this plague of
savages.[^417] Those who remain after the killing will return to harass
the king's realm.[^418]

Rather, here is a plan, relying on which the plague of savages will be
properly uprooted.[^419] So let the king provide seed and fodder for
those in the realm who work in growing crops and raising cattle.[^420]
Let the king provide funding for those who work in trade. Let the king
guarantee food and wages for those in government service. Then the
people, occupied with their own work, will not harass the realm.[^421]
The king's revenues will be great.[^422] When the country is secured as
a sanctuary, free of being harried and oppressed, the happy people, with
joy in their hearts, dancing with children at their breast, will dwell
as if their houses were wide open.'[^423]

The king agreed with the high priest's advice and followed his
recommendation.[^424]

Then the king summoned the brahmin high priest and said to him: 'I have
eradicated the plague of savages. And relying on your plan my revenue is
now great. Since the country is secured as a sanctuary, free of being
harried and oppressed, the happy people, with joy in their hearts,
dancing with children at their breast, dwell as if their houses were
wide open. Brahmin, I wish to perform a great sacrifice. Please instruct
me. It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.'

<!--pg-->
#### 4.1. The Four Accessories

'In that case, let the king announce this throughout the realm to the
aristocrat vassals of both town and country; the ministers and
councillors of both town and country; the well-to-do brahmins of both
town and country; and the well-off householders of both town and
country.[^425] "I wish to perform a great sacrifice. Please grant your
approval, good sirs; it will be for my lasting welfare and happiness."

The king agreed with the high priest's advice and followed his
recommendation. And all of the people who were thus informed responded
by saying: 'May the king perform a sacrifice! It is time for a
sacrifice, great king.' And so these four consenting factions became
accessories to the sacrifice.[^426]

<!--pg-->
#### 4.2. The Eight Accessories

King Mahāvijita possessed eight factors.[^427]

He was well born on both his mother's and father's side, of pure
descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh
paternal generation.

He was attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. He was
magnificent and splendid as the Divinity, remarkable to behold.

He was rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots
of property and assets, lots of money and grain, and a full treasury and
storehouses.

He was powerful, having an army of four divisions that was obedient and
carried out instructions. He'd probably prevail over his enemies just
with his reputation.[^428]

He was faithful, generous, a donor, his door always open. He was a
well-spring of support, making merit with ascetics and brahmins, for
paupers, vagrants, supplicants, and beggars.

He was very learned in diverse fields of learning. He understood the
meaning of diverse statements, saying:[^429] 'This is what that
statement means; that is what this statement means.'

He was astute, competent, and intelligent, able to think issues through
as they bear upon the past, future, and present.[^430]

These are the eight factors that King Mahāvijita possessed.
And so these eight factors also became accessories to the sacrifice.

<!--pg-->
#### 4.3. Four More Accessories

And the brahmin high priest had four factors.[^431]

He was well born on both his mother's and father's side, of pure
descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh
paternal generation.

He recited and remembered the hymns, and had mastered the three Vedas,
together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology
and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knew them
word-by-word, and their grammar. He was well versed in cosmology and the
marks of a great man.

He was ethical, mature in ethical conduct.

He was astute and clever, being the first or second to hold the
sacrificial ladle.

These are the four factors that the brahmin high priest possessed. And
so these four factors also became accessories to the sacrifice.

<!--pg-->
#### 4.4. The Three Modes

Next, before the sacrifice, the brahmin high priest taught the three
modes to the king. 'Now, though the king wants to perform a great
sacrifice, he might have certain regrets, thinking: "I shall lose a
great fortune," or[^432] "I am losing a great fortune," or "I have lost
a great fortune." But the king should not harbor such regrets.'

These are the three modes that the brahmin high priest taught to the
king before the sacrifice.

<!--pg-->
#### 4.5. The Ten Respects

Next, before the sacrifice, the brahmin high priest dispelled the king's
regret regarding the recipients in ten respects:[^433]

'There will come to the sacrifice those who kill living creatures and
those who refrain from killing living creatures. As to those who kill
living creatures, the outcome of that is theirs alone. But as to those
who refrain from killing living creatures, it is for their sakes that
the king should sacrifice, relinquish, rejoice, and gain confidence in
his heart.[^434]

There will come to the sacrifice those who steal ... commit sexual
misconduct ... lie ... use divisive speech ... use harsh speech ... talk
nonsense ... are covetous ... have ill will ... have wrong view and
those who have right view. As to those who have wrong view, the outcome
of that is theirs alone. But as to those who have right view, it is for
their sakes that the king should sacrifice, relinquish, rejoice, and
gain confidence in his heart.'

These are the ten respects in which the high priest dispelled the king's
regret regarding the recipients before the sacrifice.

<!--pg-->
#### 4.6. The Sixteen Respects

Next, while the king was performing the great sacrifice, the brahmin
high priest educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired the king's mind
in sixteen respects:

'Now, while the king is performing the great sacrifice, someone might
say, "King Mahāvijita performs a great sacrifice, but he
did not announce it to the aristocrat vassals of town and country.[^435]
That's the kind of great sacrifice that this king performs." Those who
speak against the king in this way have no legitimacy. For the king did
indeed announce it to the aristocrat vassals of town and country. Let
the king know this as a reason to sacrifice, relinquish, rejoice, and
gain confidence in his heart.

While the king is performing the great sacrifice, someone might say,
"King Mahāvijita performs a great sacrifice, but he did not
announce it to the aristocrat vassals; the ministers and councillors;
the well-to-do brahmins; and the well-off householders. That's the kind
of great sacrifice that this king performs." Those who speak against the
king in this way have no legitimacy. For the king did indeed announce it
to all these people.[^436] Let the king know this too as a reason to
sacrifice, relinquish, rejoice, and gain confidence in his heart.

While the king is performing the great sacrifice, someone might say that
he does not possess the eight factors. Those who speak against the king
in this way have no legitimacy. For the king does indeed possess the
eight factors. Let the king know this too as a reason to sacrifice,
relinquish, rejoice, and gain confidence in his heart.

While the king is performing the great sacrifice, someone might say that
the high priest does not possess the four factors. Those who speak
against the king in this way have no legitimacy. For the high priest
does indeed possess the four factors. Let the king know this too as a
reason to sacrifice, relinquish, rejoice, and gain confidence in his
heart.'

These are the sixteen respects in which the high priest educated,
encouraged, fired up, and inspired the king's mind while he was
performing the sacrifice.

And brahmin, in that sacrifice no cattle were killed, no goats or sheep
were killed, and no chickens or pigs were killed. There was no slaughter
of various kinds of creatures. No trees were felled for the sacrificial
post. No grass was reaped to strew over the place of sacrifice. No
bondservants, servants, or workers did their jobs under threat of
punishment and danger, weeping with tearful faces. Those who wished to
work did so, while those who did not wish to did not.[^437] They did the
work they wanted to, and did not do what they didn't want to. The
sacrifice was completed with just ghee, oil, butter, curds, honey, and
molasses.[^438]

Then the aristocrat vassals, ministers and councillors, well-to-do
brahmins, and well-off householders came to the king bringing abundant
wealth and said, 'Sire, this abundant wealth is specially for you alone;
may Your Highness accept it!'[^439]

'There's enough raised for me through regular taxes. Let this be for
you; and here, take even more!'

When the king turned them down, they withdrew to one side to think up a
plan, 'It wouldn't be proper for us to take this abundant wealth back to
our own homes. King Mahāvijita is performing a great
sacrifice. Let us make an offering as an auxiliary sacrifice.'

Then the aristocrat vassals of town and country set up gifts to the east
of the sacrificial enclosure. The ministers and councillors of town and
country set up gifts to the south of the sacrificial enclosure. The
well-to-do brahmins of town and country set up gifts to the west of the
sacrificial enclosure. The well-off householders of town and country set
up gifts to the north of the sacrificial enclosure.

And brahmin, in that sacrifice too no cattle were killed, no goats were
killed, and no chickens or pigs were killed. There was no slaughter of
various kinds of creatures. No trees were felled for the sacrificial
post. No grass was reaped to strew over the place of sacrifice. No
bondservants, servants, or workers did their jobs under threat of
punishment and danger, weeping with tearful faces. Those who wished to
work did so, while those who did not wish to did not. They did the work
they wanted to, and did not do what they didn't want to. The sacrifice
was completed with just ghee, oil, butter, curds, honey, and molasses.

And so there were four consenting factions, eight factors possessed by
King Mahāvijita, four factors possessed by the high priest,
and three modes. Brahmin, this is called the sacrifice accomplished with
three modes and sixteen accessories."

When he said this, those brahmins made an uproar,[^440] "Hooray for such
sacrifice! Hooray for the accomplishment of such sacrifice!"

But the brahmin Kūṭadanta sat in silence.[^441] So those
brahmins said to him, "How can you not applaud the ascetic Gotama's fine
words?"

"It's not that I don't applaud what he said. If anyone didn't applaud
such fine words, their head would explode!

But, gentlemen, it occurs to me that the ascetic Gotama does not say:
'So I have heard' or 'It ought to be like this.'[^442] Rather, he just
says: 'So it was then, this is how it was then.'

It occurs to me that the ascetic Gotama at that time must have been King
Mahāvijita, the owner of the sacrifice, or else the brahmin
high priest who facilitated the sacrifice for him.

Does Mister Gotama recall having performed such a sacrifice, or having
facilitated it, and then, when his body broke up, after death, being
reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm?"

"I do recall that, brahmin. For I myself was the brahmin high priest at
that time who facilitated the sacrifice."[^443]

<!--pg-->
## 5. A Regular Gift as an Ongoing Family Sacrifice.

"But Mister Gotama, apart from that sacrifice accomplished with three
modes and sixteen accessories, is there any other sacrifice that has
fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and
beneficial?"[^444]

"There is, brahmin."

"But what is it?"

"The regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice given specially to
ethical renunciates;[^445] this sacrifice, brahmin, has fewer
requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial."

"What is the cause, Mister Gotama, what is the reason why those regular
gifts as ongoing family sacrifice have fewer requirements and
undertakings, yet are more fruitful and beneficial, compared with the
sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories?"

"Because neither perfected ones nor those who are on the path to
perfection will attend such a sacrifice. Why is that? Because beatings
and throttlings are seen there.[^446]

But the regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice given specially to
ethical renunciates; perfected ones and those who are on the path to
perfection will attend such a sacrifice. Why is that? Because no
beatings and throttlings are seen there.

This is the cause, brahmin, this is the reason why those regular gifts
as ongoing family sacrifice have fewer requirements and undertakings,
yet are more fruitful and beneficial, compared with the sacrifice
accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories."

"But Mister Gotama, apart from that sacrifice accomplished with three
modes and sixteen accessories and those regular gifts as ongoing family
sacrifice, is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and
undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?"

"There is, brahmin."

"But what is it?"

"When someone gives a dwelling specially for the Saṅgha of
the four quarters."[^447]

"But is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and
undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?"

"When someone with confident heart goes for refuge to the Buddha, the
teaching, and the Saṅgha."

"But is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and
undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?"

"When someone with a confident heart undertakes the training rules to
refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, sexual misconduct,
lying, and beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants."[^448]

"But is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and
undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?"

"There is, brahmin.

It's when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully
awakened Buddha ... That's how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics.
... They enter and remain in the first absorption ... This sacrifice has
fewer requirements and undertakings than the former, yet is more
fruitful and beneficial. ...

They enter and remain in the second absorption ... third absorption ...
fourth absorption. This sacrifice has fewer requirements and
undertakings than the former, yet is more fruitful and beneficial. ...

They project and extend the mind toward knowledge and vision ... This
sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings than the former, yet
is more fruitful and beneficial.

They understand: '... there is nothing further for this place.' This
sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings than the former, yet
is more fruitful and beneficial. And, brahmin, there is no other
accomplishment of sacrifice which is better and finer than this."[^449]

## 6. Kūṭadanta Declares Himself a Lay Follower

When he had spoken, Kūṭadanta said to the Buddha,
"Excellent, Mister Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the
overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the
lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see
what's there, Mister Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways. I
go for refuge to Mister Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant
Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Mister Gotama remember me
as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.

And these bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats, and rams---seven hundred of
each---I release them, I grant them life! Let them eat green grass and
drink cool water, and may a cool breeze blow upon them!"[^450]

<!--pg-->
## 7. The Realization of the Fruit of Stream-Entry

Then the Buddha taught Kūṭadanta step by step, with a talk
on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of
sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of
renunciation. And when he knew that Kūṭadanta's mind was
ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained
the special teaching of the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its
cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would
properly absorb dye, in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision
of the Dhamma arose in the brahmin Kūṭadanta: "Everything
that has a beginning has an end."

Then Kūṭadanta saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the
Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became
self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher's
instructions. He said to the Buddha, "Would Mister Gotama together with
the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow's meal from
me?" The Buddha consented with silence.

Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Kūṭadanta got
up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping
him on his right, before leaving. And when the night had passed
Kūṭadanta had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in
his own sacrificial enclosure. Then he had the Buddha informed of the
time, saying, "It's time, Mister Gotama, the meal is ready."

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
went to the sacrificial enclosure of Kūṭadanta together
with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread
out.

Then Kūṭadanta served and satisfied the mendicant
Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with
delicious fresh and cooked foods. When the Buddha had eaten and washed
his hand and bowl, Kūṭadanta took a low seat and sat to one
side. Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him
with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left.
