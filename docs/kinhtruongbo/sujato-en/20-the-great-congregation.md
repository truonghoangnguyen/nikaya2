# DN 20 The Great Congregation

_**Mahāsamayasutta**_

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in the
land of the Sakyans, in the Great Wood near Kapilavatthu, together with
a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants, all of whom were
perfected ones. And most of the deities from ten solar systems had
gathered to see the Buddha and the Saṅgha of
mendicants.[^684]

Then four deities of the Pure Abodes, aware of what was happening,
thought:[^685] "Why don't we go to the Buddha and each recite a verse in
his presence?"

Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm,
they vanished from the Pure Abodes and reappeared in front of the
Buddha. They bowed to the Buddha and stood to one side. Standing to one
side, one deity recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "There's a great congregation in the woods,[^686]\
> where heavenly hosts have assembled.\
> We've come to this righteous congregation\
> to see the invincible Saṅgha!"

Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "The mendicants there are immersed in samādhi,\
> they've straightened their own minds.\
> Like a charioteer holding the reins,\
> the astute ones protect their senses."

Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "They snapped the post and snapped the cross-bar,\
> unstirred, they tore out the boundary post.[^687]\
> They live pure and immaculate,\
> the young giants tamed by the Clear-eyed One."[^688]

Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha's presence:

> "Anyone who has gone to the Buddha for refuge\
> won't go to a plane of loss.\
> After giving up this human body,\
> they swell the hosts of gods."[^689]

## 1. The Gathering of Deities

Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:

"Mendicants, most of the deities from ten solar systems have gathered to
see the Realized One and the mendicant Saṅgha. The Buddhas
of the past had, and the Buddhas of the future will have, gatherings of
deities that are at most like the gathering for me now.[^690] I shall
declare the names of the heavenly hosts; I shall extol the names of the
heavenly hosts; I shall teach the names of the heavenly hosts. Listen
and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied.

The Buddha said this:

> "I invoke a paean of praise![^691]\
> Where the earth-gods dwell,\
> there, in mountain caves,\
> resolute and composed,
>
> dwell many like lonely lions,\
> who have mastered their fears.[^692]\
> Their minds are bright and pure,\
> clear and undisturbed."
>
> The teacher knew that over five hundred\
> were in the wood at Kapilavatthu.\
> Therefore he addressed\
> the disciples who love the teaching:
>
> "The heavenly hosts have come forth;\
> mendicants, you should be aware of them."\
> Those monks grew keen,\
> hearing the Buddha's instruction.
>
> Knowledge manifested in them,\
> seeing those non-human beings.\
> Some saw a hundred,\
> a thousand, even seventy thousand,
>
> while some saw a hundred thousand\
> non-human beings.\
> But some saw an endless number\
> spread out in every direction.
>
> And all that was known\
> and distinguished by the Clear-eyed One.\
> Therefore he addressed\
> the disciples who love the teaching:
>
> "The heavenly hosts have come forth;\
> mendicants, you should be aware of them.\
> I shall extol them for you,\
> with lyrics in proper order.
>
> There are seven thousand spirits,[^693]\
> earth-gods of Kapilavatthu.\
> They're powerful and brilliant,\
> so beautiful and glorious.\
> Rejoicing, they've come forth\
> to the meeting of mendicants in the wood.
>
