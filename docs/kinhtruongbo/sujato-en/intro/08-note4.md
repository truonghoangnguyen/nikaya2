[^521]: *Pakataññū* is not elsewhere attested in the
    suttas, but it is found in the Vinaya, for example at [Bu Pc
    72:1.8](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc72/en/sujato#1.8)).

[^522]: Here the Buddha argues that, since it is possible to change the
    nature of one's own mind through practice, such changes cannot be
    random.

[^523]: It is is unusual if not unique to add "said the Buddha"
    (*bhagavā avoca*) in such a context. Normally, once a
    speaker starts, the text does not insert extra tags identifying the
    speaker without a reason, such as an interruption for a question.

[^524]: Sinhalese manuscripts, followed by PTS, include the paragraphs
    on the metaphor of the king's security ([DN
    2:63.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#63.1)) and on
    guarding the sense doors here.

[^525]: Progress through the *jhānas* is explained in terms
    of the refining of perceptions.

[^526]: "Subtle and true" is *sukhumasacca*, a term that appears only
    here.

[^527]: We have encountered the "formless attainments"
    (*arūpasamāpatti*) before, where they formed a refined
    basis for attachment to self ([DN
    1:3.13.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#3.13.4)). Here they
    appear as part of the gradual refinement of consciousness through
    the cessation of increasingly subtle perceptions.

[^528]: This is the vision of light that later came to be called a
    "sign" (*nimitta*). In the first four *jhānas* this
    persists as a "subtle" (*sukhuma*) reflection or echo of the
    "substantial" (*olārika*) material basis of meditation,
    such as the breath or the parts of the body. Even though it is a
    purely mental phenomenon, it is still "form" (*rūpa*)
    since it has physical properties like light or extension.

[^529]: The "light" (*obhāsa*) of *jhāna*
    grows from "limited" (*paritta*) to "limitless"
    (*appamāṇa*, [MN
    128:29.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn128/en/sujato#29.1)). Then the
    perception of even this limitless light vanishes, leaving only
    infinite space.

[^530]: Perception of infinite space fades away leaving only the
    infinite consciousness that is aware.

[^531]: The meditator is no longer even aware of infinite consciousness,
    but of the even vaster nothingness.

[^532]: The last of the four formless attainments is the dimension of
    neither perception nor non-perception. Since this, by definition,
    lies beyond the scope of perception, it is not included here.

[^533]: For *sakasaññī* ("takes charge of their own
    perception"), see [Bu Pj
    2:6.2.2](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2/en/sujato#6.2.2).
    One relevant factor in determining whether an object has been stolen
    is if the accused "perceives it as their own". Here it means that
    the meditator understands that they can evolve their own perceptions
    through meditation.

[^534]: "Intend and choose" is *ceteyyaṁ
    abhisaṅkhareyyaṁ* (1st singular optative). These
    synonyms are used in the sense of a subtle sense of will or
    intentionality that underlies such attainments ([MN
    52:14.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn52/en/sujato#14.3)) and which
    must be let go lest they generate rebirth ([MN
    140:22.10](https://suttacentral.net/mn140/en/sujato#22.10)).

[^535]: Compare with "progressive cessation" ([AN
    9.31](https://suttacentral.net/an9.31/en/sujato)), "progressive
    tranquilizing of conditions" ([SN
    36.15](https://suttacentral.net/sn36.15/en/sujato)), "progressive
    meditations" ([AN 9.32](https://suttacentral.net/an9.32/en/sujato)),
    etc. \| "Awareness" is *sampajāna*, which we have
    encountered previously as "situational awareness" in daily
    activities, or as the "awareness" in the third *jhāna*.
    Here it refers to a reflective capacity to understand the nature of
    deep meditation in terms of causality. The term was adopted by
    Patañjalī, who defined
   *saṁprajñātasamādhi* in a way that is clearly drawn
    from the Buddhist definition of *jhāna*. It is attained
    with *vitakka*, *vicāra*, *ānanda*
    ("bliss"), and *āsmitā*. According to the commentary,
    this last term is "experience of the one self",
   *ekātmikā saṁvid*) and so is probably
    adapted from the Buddhist factor of *ekaggatā*.
    (Yogasūtra 1.17).

[^536]: Taking the kernel of Yājñavalkya's theory of the
    cessation of limited perception, the Buddha has expanded it in
    psychological and practical detail, while leaving out the
    metaphysical assumption of the Self.

[^537]: Poṭṭhapāda shows the Buddha that he has been paying
    attention. Notice how it is culturally assumed that it is possible
    to retain and repeat the exact content of the teaching.

[^538]: The meaning of this is not clear to me. It might mean that
    insight can be developed based on any of the stages of meditation,
    so for that person their peak of perception is different to
    another's. The commentary says that it refers to different
    meditation subjects, or simply to different occasions of meditation.

[^539]: Poṭṭhapāda's distinction between "perception"
    (*saññā*) and "knowledge" (*ñāṇa*) echoes
    Yājñavalkya's distinction between "perception"
    (*saṁjā*) and "consciousness" (*vijñāna*,
    or in the repeated passage at 4.5.13, *prajñāna*).

[^540]: Perception has been described in terms of the progress through
    more refined meditations (*samādhi*). Only then does
    the "knowledge" (*ñāṇa*) of insight arise.

[^541]: The term "specific condition" (*idappaccayā*) is
    well known from dependent origination (eg. [SN
    12.20:2.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.20/en/sujato#2.3)), where
    it applies to the general situation of ongoing existence in
    transmigration. When developing insight, a meditator takes their own
    meditation experience as their primary locus. This is then
    generalized to an understanding of the nature of conscious
    existence.

[^542]: This draws from the initial presentation of different theories
    of the person and perception ([DN
    9:6.4](https://suttacentral.net/dn9/en/sujato#6.4)).

[^543]: "Believe" is *paccesi*, literally "fall back on". It implies
    that an idea is something one relies on or takes as fundamental. The
    Buddha wants to know where Poṭṭhapāda stands before
    exploring this topic.

[^544]: Despite his previous questions about perception and the self,
    Poṭṭhapāda takes his stand on a purely materialist
    view, identifying the "self" with the organic "substantial" body.

[^545]: Again, the Buddha does not rush to tell Poṭṭhapāda
    he is right or wrong, but rather draws out the implications of his
    statement.

[^546]: Here *tiṭṭhateva* is not "leaving aside", but
    "remains". Compare the similar construction at [MN
    107:13.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn107/en/sujato#13.1).

[^547]: This is the "subtle" (*sukhuma*) body, corresponding with the
    form experienced in the four jhānas. All manuscripts
    appear to be missing the expected *rūpī* in this
    passage, but it occurs in the corresponding passage on
    "reincarnation" below.

[^548]: This identifies the self as that which is experienced in the
    formless attainments. Poṭṭhapāda is simply cycling
    through possible self theories without really thinking through the
    implications.

[^549]: Poṭṭhapāda can only attest a belief in various
    theories and still does not know how to assess them for himself.

[^550]: The text shifts from *añña* "other" (eg.
   *aññadiṭṭhikena*) to *aññatra*
    (*aññatr'āyogena*), which normally means
    "apart from". Most authorities follow the commentary in taking
   *aññatra* here in the sense of "other". However I think
    the change of sense is deliberate; the Buddha is not discouraging
    them, merely informing them what it will take.

[^551]: This is the famous list of ten "undeclared points", which are
    found throughout the suttas (eg. [MN
    25:10.21](https://suttacentral.net/mn25/en/sujato#10.21), [MN
    63:2.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn63/en/sujato#2.3), [MN
    72:3.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn72/en/sujato#3.1), and the whole
    of SN 44). They seem to have functioned as a kind of checklist by
    which philosophers could be evaluated and classified. \| The word
   *loka* occurs in a number of senses, but here it refers to the
    entire "cosmos" of countless worlds.

[^552]: This phrase recurs at [SN
    21.9:1.4](https://suttacentral.net/sn21.9/en/sujato#1.4) and [AN
    3.64:11.1](https://suttacentral.net/an3.64/en/sujato#11.1), with
    some variant readings.

[^553]: The commentary says Citta was the son of an elephant trainer.
    Here he shows greater respect to the Buddha than does
    Poṭṭhapāda.

[^554]: This point seems to be lost on a number of modern commentators,
    who infer from passages such as the ten undeclared points that the
    Buddha refused to make any definitive declarations at all. The
    Buddha, rather, was a *vibhajjavādin* ([MN
    99:4.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn99/en/sujato#4.4), [AN
    10.94:4.7](https://suttacentral.net/an10.94/en/sujato#4.7)), "one
    who speaks after analysis".

[^555]: See [DN
    1:2.38.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#2.38.2).

[^556]: The Buddha does not rely on rumor; he begins by checking his
    facts with those concerned. Not only does this affirm his commitment
    to truth, it shows respect and establishes a common ground from
    which the argument proceeds.

[^557]: The verb *viharati* means "dwell", and functions as an auxiliary
    verb implying duration. In spiritual contexts it often means "a
    period or state of meditation". This first question is asking
    whether they see such a state in a regular meditation practice.

[^558]: Perhaps they might not be able to develop a meditation for
    seeing that self, but at some point they may have had some sort of
    perception or vision or insight.

[^559]: Since they have no experience, they might at least have an idea
    how to reach that experience.

[^560]: They haven't even heard a report about it.

[^561]: "No demonstrable basis" renders *appāṭihīrakataṁ*.
    This is related to *pāṭihāra*, which is usually
    understood as "miracle, wonder". But the root sense is
    "demonstration" and the sense of "display of wonder" is secondary.

[^562]: *Janapadakalyāṇī* is typically rendered as "the
    most beautiful lady in the land". At [SN
    47.20:2.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.20/en/sujato#2.2) we learn
    that she is a dazzling singer and dancer. And while she was famed
    for her beauty ([Ud
    3.2:9.1](https://suttacentral.net/ud3.2/en/sujato#9.1)), the word
   *kalyāṇa* normally means "(morally) good, fine, lovely"
    and does not refer solely to her appearance.

[^563]: *Nisseni* only occurs elsewhere in [Bu Ss
    6:2.3.6](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6/en/sujato#2.3.6)
    and [Bu Ss
    7:2.67](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7/en/sujato#2.67),
    where it is something carried, i.e. a ladder rather than a flight of
    stairs.

[^564]: *Attapaṭilābha* is literally "re-acquisition of
    self", where *attā* is explained by the commentary as
   *attabhāva*, the "state of the self" or "life-form"
    that is acquired at rebirth, i.e. the body (*sarīra*),
    whether material or immaterial.

[^565]: These recap the three theses of perception and the self posted
    by Poṭṭhapāda from [DN
    9:22.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn9/en/sujato#22.1).

[^566]: Compare with the similar sentiment at [SN
    22.2:10.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.2/en/sujato#10.1).

[^567]: The Buddha points to the experience to demonstrate what he is
    talking about, rather than offering a long theoretical explanation.
   *Ayaṁ* is a pronoun of presence, used to indicate what
    is apparent before the subject.

[^568]: Citta is asking an ontological question, assuming that these
    three states are existent realities of the self.

[^569]: The Buddha reframes the question as one of conventional
    description. He is describing states in which one might be reborn,
    not underlying ontologies.

[^570]: This anticipates one of the great philosophical debates of
    sectarian Buddhists which gave rise to the
    Sarvāstivāda, the school whose core doctrine was that
    "all exists (in the past, future, and present)". The Buddha
    describes past, future, and present with the three grammatical
    tenses.

[^571]: Compare Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3.3.3.2.

[^572]: Words such as "self" have a conventional usage and in that
    context are perfectly fine. But what that "self" refers to is
    constantly changing, as it is reincarnated in different states. It
    is like a river which keeps the same name even though the water is
    always changing. If, driven by attachment, we assume there is a
    metaphysical reality underlying the conventional "self", we step
    beyond what can be empirically verified. Note, however, that the
    Buddha is *not* asserting that there are two levels of truth,
    conventional and ultimate, a distinction not found in early
    Buddhism. \| Compare [MN
    139:3.9](https://suttacentral.net/mn139/en/sujato#3.9), [MN
    74:13.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn74/en/sujato#13.1).

[^573]: In [AN 6.60](https://suttacentral.net/an6.60/en/sujato) we find
    Citta Hatthisāriputta, still a somewhat junior monk,
    rudely interrupting his seniors. After admonition he disrobed, but
    he ordained again and later achieved arahantship. We can reconcile
    these two accounts by recognizing that the phrase *acira* "not long
    after" is a conventional term, which might be several years. Thus
    the events of AN 6.60 occurred some time between his ordination and
    awakening.

[^574]: Ānanda's role became more prominent as a leader of the
    Saṅgha in the years after the Buddha's passing. This
    sutta shows the continued propagation of the Buddha's teachings
    after his death.

[^575]: The same Subha earlier met the Buddha in [MN
    99](https://suttacentral.net/mn99/en/sujato) and again in [MN
    135](https://suttacentral.net/mn135/en/sujato), where he asked about
    kamma. His father Todeyya was a prominent brahmin, often mentioned
    alongside Pokkharasāti. The two apparently lived not
    far from each other, as, according to the commentary, Todeyya was
    named for his village of Tudi outside of Sāvatthī (see
    Pāṇini's Aṣṭādhyāyī 4.3.94). \| These
    events suggest a certain, albeit tenuous, timeframe for the
    significant conversion of influential brahmins initiated by
    Pokkharasāti in [DN
    3](https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato). Here, Subha is active
    after the Buddha's death, suggesting his age is aligned with that of
    Ānanda, a generation younger than the Buddha. If this is so, Subha's
    first meeting with the Buddha would have taken place no earlier than
    the middle period of his teaching, perhaps twenty years before the
    Parinibbāna (MN 99). There he mentions
    Pokkharasāti's hostility to the claims of ascetics, so
    this must precede Pokkharasāti's conversion in DN 3 by
    a considerable period. If we are on the right track, the conversion
    of Pokkharasāti, and the events that flowed from that,
    must have happened late in the Buddha's career, perhaps in the final
    decade of his life.

[^576]: Ānanda was getting old.

[^577]: Cetaka is mentioned only here. The commentary says he was named
    for his home country of Cetī, which is roughly the
    modern region of Bundelkhand, about 500 km south-west of
    Sāvatthī.

[^578]: What follows has much the same content as [DN
    2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato), but arranged under these
    three heads rather than as successively refined happiness.

[^579]: While *samādhi* proper is the deep immersion in
    meditation, here it is a category that pertains to developing such
    states.

[^580]: He had already gone to the Buddha for refuge in [MN
    99:28.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn99/en/sujato#28.4) and [MN
    135:21.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn135/en/sujato#21.4).

[^581]: This was the scene for some controversial discussions with Jains
    ([MN 56](https://suttacentral.net/mn56/en/sujato), [SN
    42.8](https://suttacentral.net/sn42.8/en/sujato)), and
    Sāriputta's touching declaration of faith shortly
    before his passing ([SN
    47.12](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.12/en/sujato), [DN
    16:1.16.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#1.16.1), [DN
    28](https://suttacentral.net/dn28/en/sujato)). It is probably the
    Pāvā (modern Pawapuri) at which Mahāvīra
    died according to the Jain tradition.

[^582]: Kevaḍḍha is mentioned only here. Manuscripts spell
    his name variously as Kevaddha or Kevaṭṭa
    ("fisherman"). The Chinese form means "sturdy" (from
   *dṛḍha*) and thus supports Kevaḍḍha.

[^583]: I have been asked to do the same thing for the same reason.

[^584]: In fact it is forbidden in [Kd
    15:8.2.23](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/sujato#8.2.23).

[^585]: The reading *dhaṁsemi* is dubious. An old Burmese
    manuscript has the reading *dhammaṁ desemi*, which
    echoes the Buddha just above. Note too that Kevaḍḍha
    urges the Buddha to "direct" the monks (*samādisatu*,
    from the same root as *desemi*). I think the tension is deliberate:
    Kevaḍḍha says he isn't telling the Buddha how to teach,
    but he absolutely is. Other readings convey the sense "attack,
    insult", but this seems out of place.

[^586]: As noted previously, the basic sense of
   *pāṭihāriya* is "demonstration", and as the context
    here shows, it may or may not involve a "demonstration of wonders"
    i.e. a "miracle".

[^587]: These three are mentioned frequently in the suttas. Only the
    last is endorsed by the Buddha, as it leads to genuine growth.

[^588]: Their priors have been confirmed.

[^589]: Note how a skeptical mindset sticks closer to the truth.

[^590]: "Spell" is *vijjā* (Sanskrit *vidyā*,
    "(potent) knowledge", cf. English "wicca", "wizard", "witch"). The
    commentary says it was practiced by the seers of
    Gandhāra (north-west Pakistan). Jain tradition also
    knows a Gandhārī mantra, but attribute it to certain
   *vidyādhara* deities. Sanskrit tradition similarly
    knows of a *vidyādevī* ("lore goddess") named
    Gandhārī. Gandhāra was an ancient land of
    learning, and a convenient location for exotic magics.

[^591]: These feats that have nothing to do with spiritual growth, hence
    they may be produced or perhaps faked by a variety of means.

[^592]: "Revealing" is *ādesana*, from root *dis* "to
    indicate, show, or point".

[^593]: The Pali terms here are *citta*, *cetasika*, *vitakka*, and
   *vicāra*.

[^594]: Here we have *mano* (twice) and *citta*.

[^595]: From *maṇi*, "gem". Magical gems are a common
    feature of Indian storytelling. Buddhist stories often feature the
    "wish-granting gem" (*cintāmaṇi*), which according to
    the commentary is meant here.

[^596]: This story is presented as an actual event, but is phrased like
    a fable.

[^597]: The question is about meditation, not the annihilation of the
    material world. The first four *jhānas* are based on
    the "subtle form" (*sukhumarūpa*) that manifests as
    light in deep meditation. He is asking how to go beyond this to the
    formless attainments.

[^598]: The mendicant has already well developed the
   *jhānas*. \| "Controlling the body as far as the
    Brahmā realm" is one of the "demonstrations of psychic
    power" listed above.

[^599]: The "gods of the Four Great Kings" are deities born in a realm
    subject to the overlords known as the Four Great Kings. These
    deities inhabit the lowest of the celestial realms.

[^600]: These are powerful spirits who guard the four quarters. In [AN
    8.36](https://suttacentral.net/an8.36/en/sujato) it is explained
    that they, like the other leading gods mentioned below, achieved
    their station due to their greater generosity and morality.

[^601]: The "thirty-three" enjoy refined sensual delights. The number is
    a reduplication of the trinity. In Buddhist texts they are not
    enumerated, but Yājñavalkya reckons them as eight
    Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Ādityas, plus Indra and
    Prajāpati (Bṛhadāraṇyaka
    Upaniṣad 3.9.2). The final pair are elsewhere said to
    be Dyaus ("Heaven" = Zeus) and Pṛthivī ("Earth"), or
    the twin Aśvins.

[^602]: Conventionally known as "lord of gods", but in fact the ruler
    only of the relatively lowly realm of the thirty-three. He is Vedic
    Indra, heroic slayer of the dragon Vṛtra, and is the
    most personally known god in the Pali Canon.

[^603]: Gods in this realm (spelled *yāma*, "of Yama") are
    subjects of the god of the dead, Yama.

[^604]: The previous deities achieved their station by mere morality and
    generosity, not by *jhāna*. The gods of
    Brahmā's Host practiced the first *jhāna*,
    but they do not know what lies beyond.

[^605]: The same passage appears in [DN
    1:2.5.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#2.5.2), where it
    also had a satirical tone, poking fun at the pomposity of religious
    titles.

[^606]: Even Brahmā's community are not confident.

[^607]: This passage may be one of the sources for the later use of
   *nimitta* to mean the appearance of light that signifies the
    approach of *jhāna*.

[^608]: He puffs his own chest, but like the ascetic teachers of [DN
    2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato), he does not answer the
    question.

[^609]: He addresses Brahmā with *āvuso*. This
    is often translated as "friend", but the root is *āyu*
    ("age") and it is respectful not familiar.

[^610]: Rather than trying to engage with Brahmā's agenda,
    he keeps restating his question. This is a skillful way of curbing
    narcissism.

[^611]: Brahmā is embarrassed to reveal his ignorance.
    Perhaps a satire of Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad
    3.2.13, where Yājñavalkya takes
    Jāratkārava Ārtabhāga by the hand and
    leads him aside for a secret discussion.

[^612]: At least he is honest about his lack of knowledge, even if not
    publicly.

[^613]: The following verses are difficult because they speak of a kind
    of consciousness at the start and the cessation of consciousness at
    the end. The simplest way to resolve this is to assume there are two
    distinct questions.

[^614]: This is a rephrasing of the original question, asking where the
    four "form" *jhānas* end.

[^615]: Here starts the second question, asking the deeper question of
    how all these things end. A similar list of descriptors elsewhere
    describes things that are not stolen ([Snp
    3.9:45.1](https://suttacentral.net/snp3.9/en/sujato#45.1)) or the
    kinds of sentient beings ([Snp
    1.8:4.3](https://suttacentral.net/snp1.8/en/sujato#4.3)). These are
    aspects of how "form" manifests in desirable or undesirable ways.

[^616]: The first four terms in this verse are identical with the first
    four terms in Yājñavalkya's description of the
    immutable Brahman as "neither coarse nor fine, neither short nor
    long" at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.8.8.

[^617]: "Where nothing appears" (*anidassanaṁ*) here is a
    synonym for "formless" (see eg. [MN
    21:14.8](https://suttacentral.net/mn21/en/sujato#14.8), "space is
    formless and invisible", *ākāso arūpī
    anidassano*). Normally the colors and images seen in the "form"
    absorptions are described as "visible" (eg. [DN
    16:3.29.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#3.29.1)), so this
    indicates the formless attainments.

[^618]: "Infinite" (*ananta*) is the direct qualifier of
    "consciousness", but in the Pali it is shifted to the next line to
    fit the meter. It indicates the second of the formless attainments.
    Yājñavalkya describes consciousness as infinite in the
    famous passage at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad
    2.4.12. \| *Pabhaṁ* means "luminous", as with the
    deities that are "self-luminous" (*sayaṁpabhā*, [DN
    27:10.3](https://suttacentral.net/dn27/en/sujato#10.3)). *Sabbato
    pabhaṁ* ("luminous all-round") is synonymous with
   *pariyodāta* ("bright", literally "white all over"), a
    stock descriptor of the mind of fourth *jhāna*, on
    which the formless states are based.

[^619]: I read these verses as broken into two statements. The first
    part, ending here, speaks of the formless attainments as "infinite
    consciousness", agreeing with the highest of the Brahmanical
    meditative sages. The following verses go further to speak of the
    cessation of consciousness.

[^620]: According to dependent origination, when consciousness ceases,
    name and form cease, and with it the manifestation of all things
    desirable and undesirable in the world.

[^621]: This is the only appearance of a place called
    Sālavatikā ("Abounding in Sal Trees"). A courtesan of
    Rājagaha named Sālavatī appears in [Kd
    8:1.3.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/sujato#1.3.1); she
    might perhaps have come from there.

[^622]: A certain brahmin Lohicca also appears in [SN
    35.132](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.132/en/sujato). But since that
    is set far away in Avantī after the Buddha's passing,
    and since in both cases he is said to have taken refuge, it seems
    likely these are different people.

[^623]: A similar view is sometimes unjustly imputed to the
    Theravādins, that they are only interested in their own
    liberation.

[^624]: While *nhāpita* would seem to be identical with
   *nhāpaka* ("bathroom attendant"), it is usually
    translated per [Ja 395](https://suttacentral.net/ja395/en/sujato)
    where it means "barber".

[^625]: Note the unusual use of *kira* in this idiom, found in [SN
    35.133:2.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.133/en/sujato#2.3), [MN
    85:3.5](https://suttacentral.net/mn85/en/sujato#3.5), [MN
    127:2.5](https://suttacentral.net/mn127/en/sujato#2.5), and [Ud
    2.8:6.8](https://suttacentral.net/ud2.8/en/sujato#6.8). I think this
    expresses polite deference, and render with "might" rather than
    "would".

[^626]: It seems the barber was not only a trusted confidant, but an
    intelligent man with sincere concern for Lohicca's well being.

[^627]: The Buddha is modest as to his chances.

[^628]: Here the Buddha takes the initiative. "Harmful misconception" is
   *pāpakaṁ diṭṭhigataṁ*.

[^629]: Kosala is the native realm of Pasenadi. Kāsi had
    formerly been an independent kingdom, but was taken over by
    Pasenadi's father Mahākosala. Towards the end of the
    Buddha's life it was contested between Kosala and Magadha ([SN
    3.14](https://suttacentral.net/sn3.14/en/sujato), [SN
    3.15](https://suttacentral.net/sn3.15/en/sujato)). Ultimately it
    became part of the greater Magadhan empire.

[^630]: It is only through sharing what good things we know that we can
    support each other.

[^631]: Even though he has characterized Lohicca's view as harmful, the
    Buddha goes out of his way to show that it is not entirely wrong.
    There are cases where it is best to avoid teaching.

[^632]: The genders of this passage are made clear through the use of
    feminine nouns. Making unwelcome advances was seen as an obvious
    example of something wrong.

[^633]: At [DN 29:5.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato#5.2) the
    opposite sense is expressed as *samādāya
    taṁ dhammaṁ vattati*.

[^634]: The Buddha adopts Lohicca's formulation, but applies it in a
    specific sense, not as a generalization.

[^635]: Now that the Buddha has established a degree of overlap between
    their views, Lohicca wants to hear more.

[^636]: Again, the Buddha answers directly and simply.

[^637]: *Naraka* means "cliff" or "abyss" in early Pali ([MN
    49:5.9](https://suttacentral.net/mn49/en/sujato#5.9), [MN
    86:6.15](https://suttacentral.net/mn86/en/sujato#6.15), [Snp
    3.11:28.4](https://suttacentral.net/snp3.11/en/sujato#28.4), [Thag
    16.8:4.2](https://suttacentral.net/thag16.8/en/sujato#4.2)). It does
    not have the sense "hell" until the late canonical period; the early
    Pali term for hell is *niraya*. Notably, *naraka* is not strongly
    attested in the sense of "hell" for pre-Buddhist Sanskrit either,
    although we do find *nāraka*, apparently in the sense
    of "hell being", at Atharva Veda 12.4.36c and Śukla Yajur Veda 30.5.

[^638]: Manasākaṭa is mentioned only here.

[^639]: Aciravatī is called Rapti today. It was one of the
    great rivers that flowed from the Himalayas through Kosala into the
    Ganges.

[^640]: Similar discussions are found in [MN
    98](https://suttacentral.net/mn98/en/sujato) = [Snp
    3.9](https://suttacentral.net/snp3.9/en/sujato) and [DN
    27](https://suttacentral.net/dn27/en/sujato). \| The compound
   *maggāmagga* can be read either as "what is the path
    and what is not the path" (per commentary, *magge ca amagge ca*), or
    as "the variety of paths" (compare *phalāphala*, "all
    sorts of fruit"). Here, however, they are concerned to distinguish
    one path as correct.

[^641]: This must have been earlier than Pokkharasāti's
    conversion at [DN
    3:2.22.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato#2.22.1).
    Pokkharasāti was a family man who denied the reality of
    superhuman meditative attainments ([MN
    99:10.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn99/en/sujato#10.4)) and
    emphasized ethics and duties over lineage ([MN
    98:3.7](https://suttacentral.net/mn98/en/sujato#3.7)), which agrees
    with him being cited on ethical matters at Āpastamba Dharmasūtra
    1.6.19.7 and 1.10.28. \| *Brahmasahabyatā* does not
    mean "union with Brahmā" but rather "rebirth as one of
    the members of Brahma's retinue" (see eg. [AN
    5.34:9.4](https://suttacentral.net/an5.34/en/sujato#9.4)). The
    non-dualist concept that the limited personal self merges with the
    cosmic divinity is expressed in Pali, rather, with such phrases as
   *so attā so loko* ("the self is identical with the
    cosmos"). \| For *añjasa* ("direct route") see [SN
    12.65:7.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.65/en/sujato#7.1) and note.

[^642]: In Pali we never meet Tārukkha and he is only
    mentioned in his absence. He evidently advocated that lineage rather
    than conduct made one a brahmin ([MN
    98:3.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn98/en/sujato#3.4)). There is a
    Tārukṣya whose view was that union (with
    Brahmā) arose with the conjunction of speech and
    breath; this was discussed alongside the views of many other
    brahmins (Aitareya Āraṇyaka 3.1.6.1;
    Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka 7.19). In Rig Veda
    8.46.32 a certain Balbūtha Tarukṣa the
    Dāsa makes an offering to a sage. Sāyaṇa,
    the Vedic commentator, says that Balbūtha
    Tarukṣa was a guardian of cows, evidently alluding to
    the Aitareya Āraṇyaka, which describes
    Tārukṣya as a guardian of his teacher's cows, thus
    locating Tārukṣya in the lineage of
    Tarukṣa. Hiraṇyakeśīgṛhyasūtra 2.8.19 also
    mentions him as a teacher, there spelled Tarukṣa.

[^643]: Identified by Wijesekera (*A Pali Reference to
    Brāhmaṇa-Caraṇas*, Adyar Library Bulletin,
    vol 20, 1956; reprinted in *Buddhist and Vedic Studies*) and
    Jayatilleke (*Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge*, p. 480). I use
    the familiar Sanskrit forms, as the Pali has several dubious
    spellings and variants. Their texts and corresponding Vedas are
    respectively: Adhvaryu = Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (incl.
    Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad; White Yajur Veda);
    Taittirīya = Taittirīya
    Brāhmaṇa (Black Yajur Veda); Chāndogya =
    Chāndogya Brāhmaṇa (Sāman
    Veda); Cāndrāyaṇa (omitted from MS edition) =
    Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa (Rig Veda; spelling
    established by Wijesekera; see below at [DN
    13:16.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn13/en/sujato#16.2));
    Bahvṛca = Bahvṛca Brāhmaṇa
    (Rig Veda; incorporated in Aitareya and Kauśītaki.)
    This is the only time the Pali canon mentions these schools, but in
    some cases we can identify them with brahmins in the canon. Examples
    include the murmuring Chāndogya brahmin ([Ud
    1.4](https://suttacentral.net/ud1.4/en/sujato)); or the Buddha's
    former teachers, who evidently hailed from the Addhariya tradition
    of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa ([MN
    26:15.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn26/en/sujato#15.1)ff.). \|
    Jayatilleke notes that the Śatapatha describes its own adherents as
    Adhvaryu (*addhariyā*), those priests of the Yajur Veda
    responsible for the physical acts at the ritual.

[^644]: Earlier they were arguing over which one of the paths was
    correct, whereas now they have shifted to a more universalist "many
    roads up the same mountain" position. When speaking with each other
    they saw each others' views as contradictory, but when speaking with
    an outsider they adopted a more conciliatory position.

[^645]: The ten names in Pali include the seven authors of the so-called
    "family books" of the Rig Veda (Maṇḍalas 2--8). As
    founders of poetic lineages, we often find works by their
    descendants, which are not always confined to their dedicated family
    book. Poems by the other three authors are mostly outside the family
    books. Thus the sages listed here cover most of the Rig Veda,
    although the Vedic tradition records many other authors as well. \|
    Aṭṭhaka = Atri Bhauma (Maṇḍala 5, rather
    than Aṣṭaka Vaiśvāmitra of 10.104);
    Vāmaka = Vamra(ka) Vaikhānasa (10.99; see
    9.66); Vāmadeva = Vāmadeva Gautama
    (Maṇḍala 4); Vessāmitta =
    Viśvāmitra Gāthina (Maṇḍala
    3); Yamadaggi = Jamadagni Bhārgava, a descendant of
    Bhṛgu (several hymns mostly in Maṇḍalas 9
    and 10); Aṅgīrasa = Aṅgirasa, identified
    with Agni as the founder of a lineage of poet-singers
    (Maṇḍala 8); Bhāradvāja =
    Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
    (Maṇḍala 6); Vāseṭṭha =
    Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
    (Maṇḍala 7); Kassapa = Kaśyapa
    Mārīca (several hymns mostly in Maṇḍalas 9
    and 10); Bhagu = Bhṛgu, the bringer of fire from heaven
    whose adoptive descendant was Gṛtsamada
    Bhārgava Śaunaka (Maṇḍala 2).

[^646]: Unlike the Buddhist monk at [DN
    11:80.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn11/en/sujato#80.1).

[^647]: "No demonstrable basis" is *appāṭihīrakataṁ*.

[^648]: The "blind following the blind" is also at [MN
    95:13.24](https://suttacentral.net/mn95/en/sujato#13.24) and [MN
    99:9.25](https://suttacentral.net/mn99/en/sujato#9.25).
    Maitrī Upaniṣad 7.8--9 turns it around,
    saying that the blind teach false doctrines aimed at destroying the
    Vedas, "the doctrine of not-self" (*nairātmyavāda*), an
    obvious reference to Buddhists. We also find it at
    Kaṭha Upaniṣad 1.2.5,
    Mahābhārata 2.38.3, and the Jain Sūyagaḍa
    1.1.2.19.

[^649]: Kuṣītaka worshiped the rising and setting sun and
    moon, turning himself to follow their course (Kauṣītaki
    Upaniṣad 2.7--9). He founded the Kauṣītaki
    lineage, referred to above as "those who follow the course of the
    moon" (*cāndrāyaṇa*).

[^650]: Indra taught Bhāradvāja a new threefold knowledge
    by which he might become immortal and realize companionship
    (*sāyujya*) with the sun (Taittirīya
    Brāhmaṇa 3.10.11.15).

[^651]: The bulk of the Vedic texts consist of prayers and invocations
    to various gods.

[^652]: Soma is the ritual drug of exhilaration, identified with the
    moon. \| Vedic Varuṇa was the god of command, the king
    of tough rule. \| Īsāna (Sanskrit Īśāna)
    was created by Pajāpati as "ruler", said to be the sun
    (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 6.1.3). He was later identified
    with Rudra and Śiva. \| Pajāpati ("progenitor") was the
    lonely god of creation; the heat of his fervent exertions (*tapas*)
    created the world and all things in it (Śatapatha
    Brāhmaṇa 6). \| Brahmā, like
    Pajāpati, is also a creator god, but is the divine
    power immanent within creation, rather than the forgotten instigator
    of the past. \| The Mahāsaṅgīti reading Mahiddhi
    ("great power") does not seem to correspond with any particular
    Vedic deity. Accept the BJT reading Mahinda (Sanskrit Mahendra), the
    "Great Indra", said to be a title of Indra bestowed after slaying
    the dragon Vṛtra (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
    2.5.4.9). \| Yama ("twin", with his incestuous sister
    Yamī) was born immortal but chose mortality, becoming
    the god of the dead.

[^653]: I wonder if this is a satire on the idea of
   *upaniṣad* ("sitting near"); even as they affirm their
    commitment to their texts, they drift apart (*visāra*)
    into separate schools and ideologies.

[^654]: The close *-ti* has apparently confused some editors;
    Vāseṭṭha is quoting what he has heard.

[^655]: Here the four *brahmavihāras* ("meditations of
    Brahmā") stand in place of the four
   *jhānas*. *Brahmavihāras* are simply one
    of the means by which *jhānas* may be attained, chosen
    here to fit the stated goal of teaching the path to
    Brahmā. The suttas treat them as pre-Buddhist, but they
    have not been traced as a group in pre-Buddhist texts. However, they
    are shared with later non-Buddhist texts such as
    Yogasūtra 1.33 and the Jain
    Tattvārthasūtra 7.11. \| "Love" (*mettā*)
    is a universal positive regard and well-wishing free of personal
    desires or attachments. It ultimately derives from the Vedic in the
    sense of "union"; Mitra was the god of alliances (Rig Veda 3.59).

[^656]: The mind in *jhāna* is so powerful that it
    effectively overrides any limited kamma, including ordinary good or
    bad deeds. Unless they have committed serious crimes with a fixed
    kammic result such as matricide, etc., the meditator will be reborn
    in a Brahmā realm.

[^657]: "Compassion" (*karuṇā*) is the quality of empathy
    with the suffering of another or oneself and the wish to remove it.

[^658]: "Rejoicing" (*muditā*) is joyful celebration in the
    success of others or oneself, free of jealousy or cynicism.

[^659]: Equanimity (*upekkhā*) is literally "close
    watching", not interfering but standing ready when needed. It is not
    indifference, which is why it emerges only at the end, after the
    positive emotions are developed.

[^660]: A brahmin student who for their whole life practices
    harmlessness for all beings---except at holy places---attains the
    world of Brahmā (Chāndogya
    Upaniṣad 8.15.1). The exception for holy places is, of
    course, to allow for the sacrifice.

[^661]: Here the entire concluding section of the Gradual Training
    dealing with wisdom is omitted, as the aim is limited to teaching
    rebirth with Brahmā to Brahmanical laypeople, rather
    than teaching liberation. Vāseṭṭha and
    Bhāradvāja later applied to ordain, in which time the
    Buddha taught the full path to Nibbana ([DN
    27:7.8](https://suttacentral.net/dn27/en/sujato#7.8)).

[^662]: They also went for refuge in similar circumstances at [MN
    98:14.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn98/en/sujato#14.4) = [Snp
    3.9:69.3](https://suttacentral.net/snp3.9/en/sujato#69.3). According
    to the commentary, that was the first time they went for refuge,
    while this was the second time. This makes sense in terms of the
    progress of the teachings, for there they discuss what makes a
    brahmin, whereas here they ask the more subtle question how to
    achieve rebirth with Brahmā. The discussion, too, is on
    a more detailed level, with a more explicit criticism of the
    brahmins. Nonetheless, it is difficult to square the details of the
    narratives, for the opening of this sutta depicts
    Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja speaking about the
    Buddha by reputation rather than as devotees who have previously met
    him and gone for refuge.
