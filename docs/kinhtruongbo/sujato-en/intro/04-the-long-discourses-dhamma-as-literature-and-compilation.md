# The Long Discourses: Dhamma as literature and compilation

::: flushright
*Bhikkhu Sujato, 2019*
:::

The Dīgha Nikāya is the first of the four main
divisions in the Sutta Piṭaka of the Pali Canon
(*tipiṭaka*). It is translated here as *Long Discourses*.
As the title suggests, its discourses are somewhat longer than those of
other *nikāyas*. There are, however, only 34 discourses in
the collection, so despite the length of the individual discourses, the
collection as a whole is the shortest of the *nikāyas*.

It is distinguished from the other *nikāyas* by its more
developed and elaborate literary forms. Outgrowing the bare and direct
style of most of the early texts, here the extra length offers space for
narratives and doctrinal expositions to find a fuller expression. This
is an early hint at how the literary form of Buddhist texts was to
develop in later years, moving towards expansiveness and abundance.

It is no coincidence that these elaborate texts are often addressed to
the brahmins, who were the self-proclaimed spiritual leaders of the
time. The brahmins were the custodians of the most sophisticated texts
in ancient India up to this time, the Vedic literature. It seems that
one aim of the Dīgha was to impress such learned men. These
discourses offer a wide range of examples of how the Buddha related to
those of other religious paths.

Another overriding theme of the Dīgha is the passing away
of the Buddha. The centerpiece of the collection is [DN
16](https://suttacentral.net/dn16), *The Great Discourse on the Buddha's
Extinguishment* (*Mahāparinibbānasutta*), a discourse of
unrivaled importance. This presents the last journey of the Buddha,
wandering in unhurried stages from town to town, each step bringing him
closer to his passing. In the very length of the text, recording so many
details of the journey, we can sense a longing to draw out those last
precious days as far as possible.

### How the Dīgha is Organized

The 34 discourses are grouped in three *vaggas*. The first *vagga*
consists of thirteen discourses, each of which includes a lengthy
passage on the spiritual practice of a monastic, known as the Gradual
Training (*anupubbasikkhā*).

In the second *vagga* we find several discourses of a more biographical
nature. [DN 14](https://suttacentral.net/dn14) *The Great Discourse on
Traces Left Behind* (*Mahāpadānasutta*) tells of past
Buddhas, while [DN 16](https://suttacentral.net/dn16)
*Mahāparinibbānasutta* tells of Gotama's last days. In
addition, some other discourses in this section are closely related to
the *Mahāparinibbānasutta*. I will discuss this cycle
further below.

The final *vagga* is more miscellaneous. It includes long poetic
sections, doctrinal compilations---some of which are precursors to the
Abhidhamma---and narratives that are often humorous and occasionally
border on farce.

As usual in the *nikāyas*, there is no overall sequence of
the teaching and many details of organization appear quite arbitrary.
Still, we can discern a purpose in the arrangement of a few of the major
discourses. These details are unique to the Theravadin tradition, so
should be seen as reflecting their concerns, rather than the fundamental
principles of the Dīgha.

The first discourse, [DN 1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1) *The Prime
Net* (*Brahmajālasutta*), sets out a scheme of wrong views,
and thus acts as a filter for the Dhamma, screening out possible
misinterpretations. It seems that this arrangement was connected with
the events of the so-called "Third Council" under King Ashoka, at a time
when the Saṅgha was overrun with imposters who were not
genuine Buddhists. The second discourse, [DN
2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2) *The Fruits of the Ascetic Life*
(*Sāmaññaphalasutta*), addresses a fundamental question:
why do people follow a life of renunciation? In answering this, it sets
forth the Gradual Training, a distinctively Buddhist path to peace.

The middle of the collection is dominated by discourses that deal in one
way or another with the cosmic significance of the Buddha ([DN
14](https://suttacentral.net/dn14), [DN
16](https://suttacentral.net/dn16), [DN
17](https://suttacentral.net/dn17), [DN
18](https://suttacentral.net/dn18), [DN
19](https://suttacentral.net/dn19), [DN
20](https://suttacentral.net/dn20), [DN
21](https://suttacentral.net/dn21); to these may be added [DN
26](https://suttacentral.net/dn26), [DN
27](https://suttacentral.net/dn27), [DN
30](https://suttacentral.net/dn30), and [DN
32](https://suttacentral.net/dn32)). Where the biographical texts of the
Majjhima emphasize the practical and the personal, the specifics of how
*our* Buddha lived, these discourses exist in an arena of mythic
grandeur. Time and space are expanded as the poignant and personal
details of the *Mahāparinibbānasutta* are set among a
series of mythological texts that show the potency of the Buddha and his
teachings in the deep past, in the apocalyptic future, and in the
present among the orders of gods.

The central event in all this is the death of the Buddha. Historically
this was a traumatic crisis for the Buddhist community, and many feared
that the Dhamma would not survive. By lifting attention from the present
trauma and pointing to a longer meaning, these suttas show that the
Dhamma need not die with the Buddha. The events of the
*Mahāparinibbānasutta* spurred the Saṅgha to
hold the First Council, where the discourses were collected and
organized to ensure their preservation. And these are, of course, the
very scriptures that we are reading. In this way, these narratives tell
the story of their own origin.

The Dīgha finishes with mostly doctrinal compilations ([DN
28](https://suttacentral.net/dn28), [DN
29](https://suttacentral.net/dn29), [DN
33](https://suttacentral.net/dn33), [DN
34](https://suttacentral.net/dn34)). If the beginning of the
Dīgha tells us *why* the teachings matter and the middle
tells us *how* they came to be, the ending tells us *what* they are. It
is a rather curious thing that in the Dīgha, many of the
doctrines that we think of as fundamental to the Buddha's teachings
occur only rarely. These discourses rectify this situation, ensuring
that the students of the Dīgha had access to a wide range
of teachings. The last two discourses, in particular, are compiled as
handy mnemonics for memorizing sets of doctrinal teachings.

### The Gradual Training

The Gradual Training sets out the steps taken by a Buddhist renunciate
on their path. It begins with the arising of a Buddha in the world.
Hearing the Buddha's teaching, a person reflects on how best it can be
applied to their own life. Realizing that "the household life is cramped
and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open", they give up
their worldly possessions and attachments, don the ochre robe of a
Buddhist mendicant, and undertake a life of morality, simplicity, and
meditation. Proceeding step by step to ever more advanced practices,
they eventually enter into deep meditative absorption
(*jhāna*) before realizing the four noble truths and
finding true freedom.

The Gradual Training is an expansion of the threefold training (*tisso
sikkhā*): ethics (*sīla*), meditative
immersion (*samādhi*), and wisdom (*paññā*).
At [AN 3.89](https://suttacentral.net/an3.89) the three trainings are
defined:

- ethics (in a monastic context) requires keeping the monastic rules;

- meditative immersion is the four absorptions;

- wisdom is the understanding of the four noble truths.

This teaching is distributed widely throughout the early Buddhist texts.
In the Dīgha, for example, it's found in the
*Mahāparinibbānasutta* as a standard teaching repeated by
the Buddha at many of the stops on his journey. A series of shorter
discourses on this subject may be found in the Samaṇa Vagga
of the Aṅguttara ([AN
3.81--91](https://suttacentral.net/an3-samanavagga)).

This brief overview of the path is explained more fully in the Gradual
Training, which explains each of the three trainings in considerable
detail. This longer exposition appears to have been the original
teaching on the overall lifestyle, practices, and aims of the Buddha's
mendicant followers. It seems that the Buddha preferred to encourage his
monastics by exhorting them to follow the highest ideals of conduct and
meditation. Only reluctantly did he set up the legal system of the
Vinaya texts, with its procedures and punishments.

The Gradual Training is found, in somewhat varying forms, in the
Majjhima ([MN 27](https://suttacentral.net/mn27), [MN
51](https://suttacentral.net/mn51), [MN
38](https://suttacentral.net/mn38), [MN
39](https://suttacentral.net/mn39), [MN
53](https://suttacentral.net/mn53), [MN
107](https://suttacentral.net/mn107), [MN
125](https://suttacentral.net/mn125)), the Aṅguttara ([AN
4.198](https://suttacentral.net/an4.198), [AN
10.99](https://suttacentral.net/an10.99)), and even the Abhidhamma ([Vb
12](https://suttacentral.net/vb12), [Pp
2.4:114](https://suttacentral.net/pp2.4#114)). Curiously enough,
however, it is not found among the collected discourses on the path
found in the last book of the Saṁyutta. While virtually all
of the practices of the Gradual Training are found in the
Saṁyutta, the overall framework is not.

The Dīgha makes up for this lack by placing a *vagga* of
thirteen discourses right at the start featuring the Gradual Training.
This is called the Sīlakkhandhavagga, the "Chapter on the
Aggregate of Ethics". Despite the title, however, these texts treat the
full training on ethics, meditative immersion, and wisdom.

While the content is similar in each place that the Gradual Training
appears, the Dīgha versions feature a pronounced emphasis
on beauty and pleasure. The stages of the path are illustrated by
similes that are as lovely as they are apt, while each step of the path
is said to be accompanied by a deepening sense of pleasure and
happiness. The Gradual Training is not a path of suffering, but one of
grace and joy and freedom.

Due to the repetition, the texts invariably abbreviate all the
expositions except for the first two discourses. It should be
remembered, however, that this is merely a consequence of how the Pali
tradition arranged these texts. In the Sanskrit and Chinese
Dīrghāgamas, the texts in this section are arranged
differently, and different suttas are either expanded or abbreviated
accordingly.

While the focus is firmly on monastic life, the general principles hold
good for everyone, and indeed at [MN 53](https://suttacentral.net/mn53)
*A Trainee* (*Sekhasutta*), Ānanda teaches essentially the same path to
a lay audience. In the Sīlakkhandhavagga, many discourses
are addressed to lay people, most of whom are brahmins.

The question of King Ajātasattu in [DN
2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2) provides the key to understanding why
this is so. He points out that in worldly life, each profession can be
seen to have its own benefit. But what is the benefit of the renunciate
life? While other ascetics falter before this question, the Buddha
presents the Gradual Training. He shows how the life gone forth is not
one of pain and distress, nor one of delayed gratification, but one that
shows real benefits in this life. It is about the power and
transformative potential of inner development and meditation. In
contrast, the household path offers only limited happiness, with much
uncertainty and stress, while the paths of other ascetics are unclear,
ineffective, or painful, and the brahmins can only offer rituals and
prayers of dubious efficacy. Thus the Gradual Training explains why
there is a need for the Saṅgha at all.

Just as the Gradual Training is built from the kernel of the threefold
training, the code of monastic ethics is built from the core principles
of basic precepts. It is divided into three sections. The first section
begins with the most fundamental precept for everyone in Buddhism:
non-violence, to refrain from killing any creature, however small. It
continues with items found in such common teachings as the five precepts
and the ten paths of skillful action. But it adds items that especially
pertain to monastic life, such as avoiding luxuries and ownership of
property. The second section on ethics expands these specifically
monastic and renunciate precepts in much greater detail, while the final
section deals with right livelihood. A Buddhist monastic, who relies on
alms food given in faith, should not make a living by other means,
especially through superstitious and magical practices.

The Gradual Training builds on these ethical foundations as the
mendicant undertakes a series of practices designed to quell the
busyness and activity of the mind. They rein in their senses, avoiding
overly stimulating things. They focus on remaining mindful and aware
throughout all their activities. They aim at contentment, being
satisfied with a few simple possessions.

Only when all these have been developed does the mendicant resort to
seclusion for meditation. Going to the forest, they undertake
mindfulness meditation and give up the five hindrances that prevent
peace of mind. These hindrances are one of the core meditation teachings
in the suttas, regarded as the key obstacle to absorption. They are:

Sensual desire

:   Includes any kind of craving, greed, or desire for sensual
    experience. It includes powerful forms such as sexual desire as well
    as more subtle kinds of attachment.

Ill will

:   Anything from outright hatred to subtle forms of annoyance and
    aversion come under this hindrance.

Dullness and drowsiness

:   When the mind begins to settle down in meditation, it commonly
    becomes sleepy or dull.

Restlessness and remorse

:   Restlessness is always looking for some future experience, while
    remorse keeps digging up the past, especially moments of regret.

Doubt

:   It is normal and healthy to doubt when it comes to things that we do
    not know. But if we do not understand the elements of what is right
    and what is wrong, doubt will subtly undermine our meditation.

Experiencing an ever-deepening peace and bliss, they ultimately enter a
series of profoundly still states of meditative immersion known as the
four absorptions (*jhānas*).

The absorptions are the fundamental meditation practice in early
Buddhism and are essential to all stages of Awakening. They occur in
many contexts, but it is here, in the Gradual Training, that they emerge
most naturally from the life and practice undertaken by the mendicants.
This context was so central to early Buddhists that when they compiled
the early Abhidhamma text, the Vibhaṅga, the chapter on
Absorption begins with the Gradual Training. It is true, there are lay
followers in the early texts who were said to have practiced absorption.
But it is equally true that when the Buddha taught how to attain such
profound peace, he emphasized the power of deep renunciation.

It has become common in certain modern forms of Buddhism to assert that
absorptions are not an essential part of the path. Others say that,
while important, the absorptions are relatively shallow states of
concentration that may be easily attained on a short retreat. Suffice to
say, neither of these views finds support in the early texts. The
absorptions are essential, profound, and difficult to attain. Even with
the full strength of renunciation, many mendicants in the Buddha's day
struggled to realize them. Nevertheless, it is a special quality of the
Dhamma that each step along the path is accompanied by deepening peace
and joy, and letting go gets easier the further one travels. This is
what makes the realization of even such profound and subtle states
possible.

Emerging from the absorptions, the mendicant harnesses the power of a
deeply purified mind to realize a series of special forms of knowledge
or insight. These culminate in the realization of the four noble truths:

1.  Suffering (*dukkha*).

2.  The origin of suffering, i.e. craving (*samudaya*).

3.  The cessation of suffering, i.e. Nibbāna (*nirodha*).

4.  The practice that leads to the end of suffering (*magga*).

Suffering is the spur that drives us to undertake spiritual practice.
Only when we have some experience of suffering will we look for an
escape. And when encountering the Buddha's teaching, a seeker recognizes
that the Dhamma speaks to that which matters in their own life, offering
a powerful and pragmatic solution. But wallowing in suffering gets you
nowhere. When you understand that this suffering is real, but has causes
and conditions that you can do something about, it sparks faith and the
resolve to act. The path itself is one of unfolding happiness and
receding pain; the truth of the ending of suffering is experienced at
every step. This culminates in the experience of profound meditative
stillness, called absorption (*jhāna*) or immersion
(*samādhi*). In such states, having let go of sensual
desire, the five external senses cease (*vivicc'eva
kāmehi*) and the mind feels a sense of peace and happiness
unlike anything it has known before. Empowered by the clarity and
brilliance of absorption, the reality of suffering and its cause becomes
apparent. This signifies that one has realized the first stage of
awakening, that of the stream-enterer (*sotāpanna*).

Stream-entry occurs when all the factors of the path---from the arousing
of faith to the practice of absorption and deep insight---have been
developed to a sufficient degree. At this point one has a profound
insight into the nature of reality, letting go of three of the ten
fetters that bind a person to rebirth. In the Gradual Training, the
understanding of the four noble truths is usually followed by the
understanding of the end of the defilements (*āsava*),
which signifies the attainment of full perfection
(*arahattā*). The remaining fetters are given up at this
point, which is the final stage of the path: full awakening and freedom.

### How to Build a Long Discourse

There are over a thousand discourses recorded in each of the
Aṅguttara and the Saṁyutta
Nikāyas, but only 34 long texts are recorded in the
Dīgha. The relatively short texts of the
Aṅguttara and Saṁyutta are reminiscent of the
pre-Buddhist Upaniṣads, especially the
Bṛhadāraṇyaka and Chandogya. These consist of a series of
mostly independent passages, each episode covering no more than a few
pages, and assembled into a much larger text. They are recollections of
concise and focused teachings at certain times and places by certain
people. It would seem, then, from the overwhelming majority of
contemporary texts both Buddhist and Brahmanical, that the short
discourse or dialogue was the standard format.

How, then, were these long texts constructed? Why? And for whom? Let us
approach these questions by briefly considering a few different forms
employed in the Dīgha.

#### Inherently Complex Subjects

Some discourses are long because the subject matter is inherently
complex and demands a lengthy explanation. Of course, the Buddha was a
master of presenting subjects in both pithy and detailed forms.
Nevertheless, there are a few discourses whose subject matter requires
extensive treatment.

The most prominent example of this is the Gradual Training. In some
cases---for example [DN 6](https://suttacentral.net/dn6) *With
Mahāli* and [DN 7](https://suttacentral.net/dn7) *With
Jāliya*---the discourse consists of little more than this
passage, with a simple narrative background and some short extra
teachings. So it seems that the presence of the long Gradual Training
section was itself enough to qualify a discourse as "long". Since this
passage aims to provide a detailed guide to the whole of the renunciate
spiritual life, from hearing the teaching to full awakening, the length
is inherent in the subject matter. True, it is taught more briefly
elsewhere, but even in those cases it tends to be somewhat long, and
there was a tendency to make it more inclusive.

In other cases the Gradual Training is taught in the middle of a
discourse that is already quite extensive. Such is the case with [DN
1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1) *Brahmajāla*, although
here, uniquely, it is only the first section on Ethics that is taught.
But the bulk of the text sets forth a network of 62 kinds of wrong view.
Here, the nature of the subject matter is so extensive and complex that
a shorter exposition would not do it justice. Indeed, when this teaching
is mentioned in shorter discourses ([SN
41.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn41.3)), it is not summarized, but the
reader is referred rather to the full text.

#### Compilations

Far more common than inherently lengthy teachings are the compilations.
In such cases, a long text provides an occasion or background framework
within which a series of short passages are collected. Such passages
usually occur in identical or near-identical form in the
Aṅguttara or the Saṁyutta, and occasionally
the Majjhima. Compiling them here enables the reciters of the
Dīgha to learn a wide range of doctrines, and provides an
essential backup, preserving the texts in case the shorter discourses
are lost.

In a few instances, such short passages are not found elsewhere in the
same form. Whether that is because they were unique to the
Dīgha, or because the parallel passages have become lost,
is hard to say.

How do we end up with parallel passages in so many different places?

the Buddha taught very often and, like all teachers, repeated his
message many times. Such repeated teachings would have been collected in
various places. This would be the case with important and generic
teachings found throughout the Buddhist literature, like the four noble
truths or the four absorptions.

In some cases, though, this is unlikely or impossible. For example, we
sometimes find the same event on the same occasion---with the same
teaching, the same location, and the same people---occurring in more
than one text. In such instances, it is clear that there is, in fact,
just one passage, and it has been copied into two or more places.

Generally speaking, it is prudent to assume that such passages existed
as short discourses before being collected into larger forms. This is
because, as noted above, the short discourse is the dominant form, and
rests closest to the oral tradition. It is a principle observed
everywhere through early Buddhist texts that the redactors preferred to
add rather than subtract. Thus texts commonly become longer over time,
and rarely shorter.

Examples of compilation are very common, and almost every discourse in
the Dīgha does this to some extent. Here are just a few
examples.

[DN 16](https://suttacentral.net/dn16)
*Mahāparinibbānasutta* includes a wide range of collected
passages. In some cases, events pertinent to the narrative may have
occurred there originally and been extracted later, while in other cases
the included passages seem strangely extraneous to the context and were
no doubt added in at some point.

Venerable Sāriputta is said to be the main author of
several such long compilations. He is the teacher in [DN
33](https://suttacentral.net/dn33) *Reciting in Concert*
(*Saṅgītisutta*) and [DN 34](https://suttacentral.net/dn34)
*Up to Ten* (*Dasuttarasutta*), which consist almost entirely of short
passages collected from elsewhere in the suttas and arranged by number.
In [DN 28](https://suttacentral.net/dn28) *Inspiring Confidence*
(*Sampasādanīyasutta*) he expresses his great faith in the
Buddha and cites a long series of passages to display the Buddha's
glory.

A more sophisticated form of compilation is found in [DN
22](https://suttacentral.net/dn22) *The Longer Discourse on Mindfulness
Meditation* (*Mahāsatipaṭṭhānasutta*), the most important
meditation discourse in 20th century Theravāda. It gives a
detailed account of the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. These are
taught in brief in many places, but the details are found only here and
at the mostly identical [MN 10](https://suttacentral.net/mn10)
*Mindfulness Meditation* (*Satipaṭṭhānasutta*). Whereas
many compilations simply list a series of different teachings, here the
text is very systematic, organizing the compiled passages under the four
heads. These meditation passages are mostly not found elsewhere in the
Dīgha, and were no doubt added to ensure the
Dīgha reciters preserved the full range of meditation
teachings.

To the already lengthy discourse at [MN
10](https://suttacentral.net/mn10) is added a full exposition on the
four noble truths, sourced from [MN 141](https://suttacentral.net/mn141)
*The Analysis of the Truths* (*Saccavibhaṅgasutta*). In
Burmese editions, this extended section later made its way back into the
text of [MN 10](https://suttacentral.net/mn10). Since SuttaCentral's
text is a Burmese one, we include this in our Pali, but mark it as an
addition.

#### Narratives: backgrounds, parables, and myths

Unusually for early Buddhist texts, the Dīgha includes
several lengthy narratives. Most obviously this includes [DN
16](https://suttacentral.net/dn16) *Mahāparinibbānasutta*.
But it also includes several other narratives.

In common with the discourses of other collections, we often find a
simple narrative background that gives context to the teaching. However,
in some cases, this is developed in much greater detail as the
narratives come to play a more sophisticated literary role than a mere
setting.

[DN 2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2) *Sāmaññaphala* opens
with King Ajātasattu of Magadha exclaiming over the beauty
of the moonlit night and asking his ministers for advice as to which
ascetic teacher he should visit. From the
*Mahāparinibbānasutta* and discourses elsewhere we know
that Ajātasattu was a warlike king, so this setting
immediately establishes a sense of wonder. The narrative unfolds
gracefully, avoiding the excess of ornament so typical of later Indian
narratives, and holding the key to its mystery close to its chest. Only
at the end of the text do we learn the dreadful secret that plagues the
king's heart. Thus the narrative portions imbue the teachings---on the
doctrines of other teachers as contrasted with the Buddha's Gradual
Training---with a tragic pathos.

In addition to backgrounds, we also find narratives that are told as
stories in the discourses themselves. These include short parables like
the tale of the monk who mistakenly sought among the gods for an answer
to his question ([DN 11](https://suttacentral.net/dn11)). In [DN
23](https://suttacentral.net/dn23) the monk Kumāra Kassapa
debates with the skeptic Pāyāsi, illustrating his arguments
with a series of tales alternatively humorous and gruesome. Such
parables are found not infrequently elsewhere in the suttas, but in the
Dīgha certain stories expand beyond this and approach the
stature of myth. This includes some of the texts in the
*Mahāparinibbānasutta* cycle, such as [DN
17](https://suttacentral.net/dn17) *Mahāsudassanasutta* and
[DN 14](https://suttacentral.net/dn14) *Mahāpadānasutta*.

To forestall a common misunderstanding, in the study of religion, "myth"
does not mean "something believed to be true that is actually false", as
it does in popular culture. Rather, a myth is a sacred story. Some
sacred stories are true, some are inventions. But this is a matter for
historians and is irrelevant to the mythology itself. The purpose of
myth is to tell a story that creates meaning for those who participate
in it, so they can understand their own lives in the context of the
story being expressed.

The Dīgha contains truly mythic texts in [DN
26](https://suttacentral.net/dn26) *The Wheel-Turning Monarch*
(*Cakkavattisīhanādasutta*) and [DN
27](https://suttacentral.net/dn27) *The Origin of the World*
(*Aggaññasutta*). These set forth a myth of origins,
replacing conventional creation mythology with an evolutionary account
of how the world came to be the way it is. In these stories, human
choices play a critical role in how the environment evolves, and in how
it will all fall apart. The *Aggañña* depicts anthropogenic
climate change quite explicitly, showing how human activity affects the
plants, the weather, and the natural ecosystem of which we are a part
(see also [AN 3.56](https://suttacentral.net/an3.56)).

The mythology is essentially cyclic. There is no absolute beginning,
just another turning of the wheel. Thus even when the world falls apart
and civilization collapses, there will be a new renaissance, far in the
future, and ultimately another Buddha will arise. He is named Metteyya
(Sanskrit: *Maitreya*), who in the early texts appears only in [DN
26](https://suttacentral.net/dn26) *Cakkavattisīhanāda*. He
went on to become one of the most important figures in
Mahāyāna Buddhism, and many Buddhists even today still
await his coming with hope. Yet [DN 26](https://suttacentral.net/dn26)
is not taught in order to encourage devotees to dedicate themselves to
Metteyya, but to illustrate the impermanence and uncertainty of our
lives. The Buddha always taught that we should practice as best we can
to understand the Dhamma in this life.

### The Mahāparinibbāna Cycle

In several instances, episodes mentioned in brief in the
*Mahāparinibbānasutta* have been spun off and expanded to
become individual discourses in their own right. Thus the
*Mahāparinibbānasutta* dominates much of the
Dīgha, not just through its length and thematic weight, but
through its influence and connections with other discourses.

In my view, this cycle of suttas was likely composed by Ānanda and his
students, beginning this great literary work with the
*Mahāparinibbānasutta* itself, and gradually branching off
into related works. The cycle as a whole shows not only Ānanda's
characteristic personal love and devotion for the Buddha, but also
reveals a concern for what is to come, for the fate of the Dhamma in the
years after the Buddha's passing. One distinctive unifying detail of
these discourses is that they do not end with the standard phrase saying
that the listeners rejoiced in the teachings, but instead finish
directly with a teaching or a verse on the subject of impermanence or
the long-lasting of the dispensation. Ānanda survived the Buddha for
several decades, and his legacy was the establishment of the texts, thus
preserving the memory of his beloved Teacher for future generations.

[DN 16](https://suttacentral.net/dn16) *The Great Discourse on the Buddha's Extinguishment* (*Mahāparinibbānasutta*)

:   Beginning with King Ajātasattu of Magadha declaring his
    intent to invade the Vajjis, and ending with the peaceful
    distribution of the Buddha's relics to the potentially warring
    nations and clans, the story of the Buddha's last journeys is as
    politically revealing as it is spiritually moving. Throughout, the
    theme of impermanence unifies the diverse events and teachings. The
    weight of constructing such an epic shows, however, in the
    considerable differences between extant versions of the text. Many
    of the extra repetitious sections---such as the superfluous sets of
    eight that follow the eight causes of earthquakes---are not found in
    all parallels. It seems that over time, more and more material was
    added, and at certain points, portions of the text were split off to
    form other discourses in the cycle.

[DN 17](https://suttacentral.net/dn17) *King Mahāsudassana*

:   In a small scene of the *Mahāparinibbānasutta*, Ānanda
    encourages the Buddha to pass away in a well-known city, not in the
    obscure village of Kusinārā. The Buddha rebukes him,
    saying that in the past it had been a great city. The Sanskrit
    (Sarvāstivāda) versions of the
   *Mahāparinibbānasutta* include a shorter account of the
    story of King Mahāsudassana in their
   *Mahāparinibbānasutta* itself, but in the Pali, it has
    become greatly extended and formed into its own long discourse. The
    discourse itself is fabulous, full of extended passages on the
    crystal balustrades and other wonders of
    Mahāsudassana's palace. But at its heart is a very
    human story: the love of the queen for her king, and the pain of
    letting go. The struggle that the queen undergoes to fully
    understand that her king must pass mirrors the struggles of Ānanda
    in the *Mahāparinibbānasutta* as he comes to terms with
    the passing of his beloved Teacher.

[DN 18](https://suttacentral.net/dn18) *With Janavasabha*

:   Like [DN 17](https://suttacentral.net/dn17), this begins with a
    short passage extracted from the
   *Mahāparinibbānasutta*, to which has been added an
    extended narrative. During the journey in the
   *Mahāparinibbānasutta*, Ānanda asks the Buddha to
    reveal the fate after the death of devotees in the town of
    Ñātika. This otherwise obscure town was the main city
    of the Ñātika clan, to which the Jain leader
    Mahāvīra belonged, and it appears to come to prominence
    to show that even his own people became Buddhists.
    Characteristically, it ends with the Buddha showing how people may
    know for themselves their own spiritual progress. This short passage
    is preserved as an independent discourse also in [SN
    55.10](https://suttacentral.net/sn55.10). In [DN
    18](https://suttacentral.net/dn18), however, the discourse continues
    with a long story of the doings of the gods, as told by the spirit
    Janavasabha. It culminates by saying that this discourse was learned
    by the Buddha from Janavasabha, and from there was taught to Ānanda,
    and he informed the assemblies of monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen,
    resulting in the Buddha's dispensation being famous and successful
    among gods and men. This corroborates the idea that these
    discourses, shaped by Ānanda, were aimed at ensuring the
    long-lasting of Buddhism.

[DN 28](https://suttacentral.net/dn28) *Inspiring Confidence* (*Sampasādanīyasuttasutta*)

:   The *Mahāparinibbānasutta* records an incident where
    Sāriputta, the Buddha's foremost disciple, comes to him
    and makes a "lion's roar" of his faith in the Buddha, based on his
    understanding of Dhamma. This is recorded as an independent
    discourse at [SN 47.12](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.12). We also
    have a short discourse at [SN
    47.13](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.13) that tells of
    Sāriputta's death. This echoes the themes of the
   *Mahāparinibbānasutta*, even including the famous
    saying that one should be one's own refuge. This must have happened
    during the journey recorded in the
   *Mahāparinibbānasutta*. Oddly, however, it is not
    included in [DN 16](https://suttacentral.net/dn16), and in addition,
    it situates the Buddha in Sāvatthī, far from the track
    of his journey. Regardless, in [DN
    28](https://suttacentral.net/dn28) the passage on the lion's roar
    was expanded into its extensive discourse, with
    Sāriputta expounding at length on various inspiring
    qualities of the Buddha. This gives an opportunity to list many
    standard doctrinal teachings. Like [DN
    18](https://suttacentral.net/dn18), the sutta ends with an
    exhortation to share the teaching.

In addition to texts that have a direct literary and narrative
connection with the *Mahāparinibbānasutta*, there is a
further series of discourses that share a more indirect or thematic
connection.

[DN 14](https://suttacentral.net/dn14) *The Great Discourse on Traces Left Behind* (*Mahāpadānasuttasutta*)

:   The Buddha gives biographical details of six past Buddhas, as well
    as a lengthy account of the life of one of them,
    Vipassī. This discourse establishes the historical
    Buddha Gotama as one of a series of world teachers that stretches
    back into the deep past, and whose dispensations all follow similar
    patterns.

[DN 29](https://suttacentral.net/dn29) *An Impressive Discourse* (*Pāsādikasutta*)

:   This begins with the story of the passing away of the Jain leader
    Mahāvīra. The Pali texts call him
   *nigaṇṭha nātaputta*, which is often
    misunderstood as a proper name. *Nigaṇṭha*, rather,
    means "knotless" and is a term for a Jain ascetic, while
   *nāta* is a misspelling of his clan, the
    Ñātikas. *Nigaṇṭha nātaputta*
    therefore means "the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan",
    just as *samaṇa gotama* means "the ascetic of the
    Gotama clan", or *acela kassapa* means "the naked ascetic of the
    Kassapa clan". In the Buddhist texts, his death is depicted as a
    disaster for the Jains, as they fell apart in conflict right away.
    Whether this is historically accurate or not, the text shows the
    Buddha taking the opportunity to teach the qualities that make a
    religious movement last long after the passing of the founder.
    Discourses in response to this are found at [DN
    16](https://suttacentral.net/dn16), [DN
    29](https://suttacentral.net/dn29), [DN
    33](https://suttacentral.net/dn33), and [MN
    104](https://suttacentral.net/mn104). In the current sutta,
    contrasting his dispensation with what he claims was the inadequacy
    of Jain teachings, the Buddha declares that the faith and practice
    of his followers are well-grounded since they are based on genuine
    Awakening.

[DN 30](https://suttacentral.net/dn30) *The Marks of a Great Man* (*Lakkhaṇasutta*)

:   The early texts refer several times to a mysterious set of bodily
    characteristics known as the "marks of a great man". These are said
    to fulfill a Brahmanical prophecy that one who possesses such marks
    will either become a universal emperor or a fully awakened Buddha.
    This prophecy and the list of thirty-two marks have not been exactly
    identified in extant Brahmanical texts, but recent research has
    uncovered a complex system of similar marks in old Brahmanical
    texts, many of which invite comparison with the Buddhist list. The
    story of the two paths is a classic mythological theme, found in the
    oldest known myth, the story of Gilgamesh. The marks of a great man
    exist as a curious counterpoint to the rational teachings found in
    most of the suttas. In this particular sutta, the Buddha is said to
    have explained each mark as a consequence of a specific kind of
    kammic deed. The literary and verse styles betray this as a late
    composition, and it has no real parallel in other collections.
    Nevertheless, it remains as a testament to the evolution of the idea
    of the Buddha, relating his spiritual qualities to his physical
    presence.

[DN 33](https://suttacentral.net/dn33) *Reciting in Concert* (*Saṅgītisutta*)

:   Like [DN 29](https://suttacentral.net/dn29), this discourse is set
    after the death of Mahāvīra. Speaking to the Mallians
    of Pāvā---who appear also in the
   *Mahāparinibbānasutta*---the Buddha asks
    Sāriputta to speak on his behalf. This echoes the theme
    of [DN 28](https://suttacentral.net/dn28) and [DN
    29](https://suttacentral.net/dn29), that it is the disciples who
    will be responsible for the continuation of the teachings.
    Sāriputta gives an extensive systematic presentation of
    doctrines, using the Aṅguttara principle of organizing
    teachings by number. Indeed, a study of this discourse can serve as
    an introduction to the teachings found in the Aṅguttara
    Nikāya. The monastics are encouraged to recite these
    teachings in concert so that they may be preserved and the
    dispensation continued for a long time. This discourse anticipates
    the systematic tendencies of the Abhidhamma, and indeed one of the
    Sarvāstivādin Abhidhamma texts
    (*Saṅgītiparyāya*) consists of an expansion and
    commentary on this discourse.

[DN 34](https://suttacentral.net/dn34) *Up to Ten* (*Dasuttarasutta*)

:   This is similar to the *Saṅgīti*, but with a briefer
    narrative context and an even more systematic style. Here the Buddha
    no longer appears, and the discourse is simply spoken by
    Sāriputta.

This does not exhaust the scope of the
*Mahāparinibbānasutta* cycle, for it is not confined to the
Dīgha. We have already mentioned that several shorter
suttas contain episodes either found in the
*Mahāparinibbānasutta* or related to it. And the story does
not end with the Buddha's death. The *Mahāparinibbānasutta*
tells of the funeral arrangements and events following the Buddha's
passing. In several versions apart from the Pali, this story continues
directly into the account of the First Council. This narrative is the
21st chapter of the Vinaya Khandhakas, and indeed the
*Mahāparinibbānasutta* is found in the Vinaya of several
schools. It is, in fact, one continuous narrative, and one of the many
purposes of the *Mahāparinibbānasutta* is to authorize the
actions of the Saṅgha at the First Council, establishing
the fundamental Buddhist scriptures in an organized and definitive
manner. The First Council narrative was then extended to the Second
Council, which echoes many of the same themes and ideas.

These stories of the end of the Buddha's life and teaching are also
echoed in the first chapter of the Vinaya Khandhakas, which tells the
story of the Buddha's awakening, first teaching, and establishing of his
community of followers. These are not just separate episodes in the
Buddha's life. The texts as we have them frequently echo ideas, turns of
phrase, events, and people, all of which show that they were edited and
composed as a coherent whole. Taken together, they make up a framework
of a magnificent mythology: the life and death of the greatest spiritual
teacher that the world has ever known.

### A Brief Textual History

The Dīgha Nikāya was edited by T.W. Rhys
Davids and J.E. Carpenter based on manuscripts in Sinhalese, Burmese,
and Thai scripts, and published in three volumes in Latin script by the
Pali Text Society from 1890 to 1910.

The first translation followed in 1899--1921 by T.W. and C.A.F. Rhys
Davids, and was published under the "Sacred Books of the Buddhists"
series under the title *Dialogues of the Buddha*. This was a milestone
in the publication of Buddhist texts, and marked the first occasion a
full *nikāya* was available in English. The translation
endeavored to retain something of the literary flavor of the texts and
is accompanied by introductory essays and notes that are often useful
and sometimes brilliant. But it is far from perfect and contains many
errors in both reading and interpretation. Today the insights of Rhys
Davids remain valuable especially in the area of history and society.

An updated translation by Maurice Walshe was published by Wisdom
Publications in 1987 under the title *Thus Have I Heard: The Long
Discourses of the Buddha*, a title that in later editions was changed to
*The Long Discourses of the Buddha*. The Walshe edition benefited from
many decades of study and practice of Dhamma in the west. Avoiding the
archaic stylings of the older translations, it remains a clear and
approachable translation, with a far more accurate handling of doctrinal
terms and passages. But it is far from perfect. It leans heavily on the
Rhys Davids translation, and while it corrects many errors, it sometimes
repeats errors found in the older translation. Worse, it not
infrequently introduces new errors.

In addition, there have been many translations of individual discourses
and passages. Of these, the following were especially useful for my
work:

- For [DN 1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1), [DN
  2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2), and [DN
  15](https://suttacentral.net/dn15), the translations of text and
  commentary by Bhikkhu Bodhi.

- For [DN 16](https://suttacentral.net/dn16), the translation by Bhikkhu
  Ānandajoti.

- For the verses of [DN 30](https://suttacentral.net/dn30), the
  translations and studies by K.R. Norman.

- For [DN 31](https://suttacentral.net/dn31), the translation by John
  Kelly, Sue Sawyer, and Victoria Yareham.
