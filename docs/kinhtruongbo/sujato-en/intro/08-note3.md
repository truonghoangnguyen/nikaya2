[^346]: The Buddha inverts Ambaṭṭha's earlier claim that
    the other three castes only succeed in serving brahmins ([DN
    3:1.14.7](https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato#1.14.7)).

[^347]: They are less strict than the previous ascetics, for they dig
    the soil and harm the plants.

[^348]: "Tradition" renders *sācariyaka*, "that which stems
    from one's own teacher".

[^349]: This practice is not elsewhere attested in early Pali.

[^350]: *Ugga* is a rare word whose root sense is "mighty", but here it
    must be a noun. Given that it is a military man who consults with
    the king, I translate as "warrior-chief". \| *Rājañña*
    is used occasionally in the suttas; it is an archaic synonym for
   *khattiya*.

[^351]: Taking this and the next as one sentence, despite the
    punctuation of the Mahāsaṅgīti text.

[^352]: The "hymns" (*mantā*) are the verses of the Rig
    Veda. The ten names here all correspond with Vedic authors according
    to the Brahmanical tradition (for details, see note on [DN
    13:13.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn13/en/sujato#13.1)). Note that
    in Sanskrit the names of the rishis are distinguished from the
    lineage holders, which take the patronymic. For example,
    Bharadvāja is the rishi, the Bhāradvājas
    are his descendants; Vasiṣṭha is the rishi, the
    Vāsiṣṭhas are his descendants. Pali texts do not make
    this distinction, but use the patronymic, although the two forms are
    not always readily distinguishable. \| "Seer" is *isi* (Sanskrit
   *ṛṣi*). It is of uncertain etymology, but was taken to
    mean that they had "seen" the Vedas (*mantradraṣṭa*) or
    directly "heard" them from Brahmā through divine
    inspiration, rather than "composing" them like ordinary authors.
    Here, however, the Buddha says they were "authors"
    (*kattāro*). The Buddha adopted *isi* in the sense
    "enlightened sage".

[^353]: *Veṭhakanatapassāhi* is otherwise unattested. At
    [MN 55:12.4](https://suttacentral.net/mn55/en/sujato#12.4)
   *veṭhaka* evidently means "collar". In the
    Lokuttaravāda Bhikṣuṇī Vinaya, the brazen
    nun Thullānandā gets out of the water and wraps herself
    in a *veṭhaka*, which here seems synonymous with
   *paṭṭaka*, a strip of cloth. It is allowable if used to
    tie a basket ([Lo Bi Pn 3](https://suttacentral.net/san-lo-bi-pn3)).
   *Nata* is "curve", *passa* is "side, flank". Walshe has "flounces
    and furbelows", Rhys Davids has "fringes and furbelows round their
    loins". These are prissy descriptions of what is evidently stripper
    gear.

[^354]: The Buddha calls back to earlier in the sutta, where
    Ambaṭṭha drove a mare-drawn chariot ([DN
    3:1.6.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato#1.6.1)). \| The
    verbs here (*vitudenti vitacchenti*) are elsewhere applied to the
    pecking and slashing of vultures, crows, or hawks ([SN
    19.1:3.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn19.1/en/sujato#3.2), [MN
    54:16.2](https://suttacentral.net/mn54/en/sujato#16.2), etc.). The
    Buddha was disgusted with this maltreatment of the mares.

[^355]: Remembering that Pokkharasāti lived in a wealthy
    property that was a royal endowment. Just as today, excessive wealth
    breeds insecurity.

[^356]: The Buddha has been hard on Ambaṭṭha, but he is not
    unfair. He invites the same level of scrutiny for himself.

[^357]: This transition occurs nowhere else.

[^358]: Finally he remembers what his teacher Pokkharasāti
    told him in [DN
    3:1.5.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato#1.5.2): he will know
    the Buddha by his marks.

[^359]: This exceedingly strange "miracle" is also found at [MN
    91:7.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn91/en/sujato#7.1), [MN
    92:14.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn92/en/sujato#14.1), and [Snp
    3.7:11.5](https://suttacentral.net/snp3.7/en/sujato#11.5).

[^360]: The diminutive ending for *paṇḍitaka* is the same
    as in *samaṇaka*, which Ambaṭṭha used of
    the Buddha. \| For *re* ("bloody"), compare *cara pi re* at [Bu Pc
    70:1.35](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70/en/sujato#1.35)
    and *he je kāḷī* at [MN
    21:9.13](https://suttacentral.net/mn21/en/sujato#9.13). Hard as the
    Buddha was on Ambaṭṭha, his own teacher was harder.

[^361]: Pokkharasāti shows his astuteness, for in many
    other dialogues the Buddha engaged with brahmins perfectly politely,
    as he does in the next sutta ([DN
    4](https://suttacentral.net/dn4/en/sujato)).

[^362]: Illustrating the lack of restraint of even a senior brahmin
    teacher.

[^363]: Given Pokkharasāti's mood, this was probably a
    diplomatic move.

[^364]: *Khādanīya* and *bhojanīya* are food
    categories commonly mentioned in Pali. Etymologically they stem from
    "hard and soft". *Bhojanīya* is defined in [Bu Pc
    37:2.1.10](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc37/en/sujato#2.1.10)
    as grain, porridge, flour products, fish, and meat, thus being foods
    that are typically eaten cooked and "mooshed up" in with the fingers
    in the bowl. *Khādanīya* is not so readily defined,
    being essentially everything not included in other categories. But
    it would have included such "crunchy" things as fruit and
    vegetables, which may be eaten uncooked.

[^365]: Pokkharasāti makes sure he hears both sides of the
    story.

[^366]: So far has Ambaṭṭha fallen from the learned sage we
    were introduced to at the start of the sutta.

[^367]: The Buddha bears no ill will. *Sukhī hotu* is one
    of the most recognizable Pali phrases, but in early texts it is
    spoken only a few times: by the Buddha at [DN
    21:1.8.8](https://suttacentral.net/dn21/en/sujato#1.8.8) and [Snp
    5.1:54.1](https://suttacentral.net/snp5.1/en/sujato#54.1); by
    Punabbasu's Mother at [SN
    10.7:10.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn10.7/en/sujato#10.1); and by
    various women at [Bu Ss
    5:1.4.8](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5/en/sujato#1.4.8).

[^368]: "Robed up" because inside the monastery, monks would normally
    wear just a lower robe, and would don the upper and (sometimes)
    outer robes when visiting a layperson's home.

[^369]: While all these teachings feature commonly in the suttas, there
    is no text that depicts this framework in detail.

[^370]: This is the briefest expression of the four noble truths.

[^371]: This indicates that he became a stream-enterer
    (*sotāpanna*), the first of four stages of Awakening.
    Such details of personal attainment are typically found in the
    narrative rather than the teaching attributed to the Buddha, and
    hence were added by redactors at some point. They vary considerably
    in different versions. In this case, the parallel at DA 20 says that
    he became a stream-enterer and later a non-returner. T 20 said that
    he understood the teaching and went for refuge, and agrees that he
    became a non-returner before his death.

[^372]: This is the insight into universal impermanence and dependent
    origination.

[^373]: When wandering for alms, mendicants would often roam randomly
    through the village (*sapadānacārī*). However if an
    invitation such as this were issued, the mendicant may visit that
    place for a meal. It was considered a special ascetic practice to
    refuse such invitations. The same invitation was issued by Lohicca
    to Mahākaccāna at [SN
    35.132:14.7](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.132/en/sujato#14.7).

[^374]: *Māṇavikā* is also mentioned at [MN
    56:27.1](https://suttacentral.net/mn56/en/sujato#27.1) and [Ud
    2.6:1.3](https://suttacentral.net/ud2.6/en/sujato#1.3) of a young
    married woman; and at [AN
    5.192:8.5](https://suttacentral.net/an5.192/en/sujato#8.5) of a baby
    being born. Thus it does not seem that it meant "female student of
    the Vedas".

[^375]: *Kalyāṇaṁ vuccati* is a politely ambiguous phrase.
    It is spoken twice elsewhere in the Pali, and both times the
    mendicant who said it immediately departed and never returned ([SN
    41.3:7.13](https://suttacentral.net/sn41.3/en/sujato#7.13), [SN
    41.4:6.7](https://suttacentral.net/sn41.4/en/sujato#6.7)).

[^376]: This sutta shows how the conversion of Pokkharasāti
    in [DN 3](https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato) affected the
    brahmins as far away as Campā.

[^377]: Campā is modern Champapuri near Bhagalpur in Bihar
    state, not far from West Bengal. It is near the eastern-most reach
    of the Buddha's journeys. Campā was the capital of
    Aṅga, one of the sixteen "great nations"
    (*mahājanapadā*). It was a flourishing trade center at
    which Northern Black Polished Ware has been found, and became a
    sacred city for the Jains.

[^378]: *Gaggarā*, an onomatopoeic reduplication
    ("gargle"), is the name of a number of rivers and whirlpools in
    Sanskrit (cp. the modern Ghaggar River in north-west India).

[^379]: Here we see how the endowment of *brahmadeyya* helped the king
    of Magadha establish his influence over the Aṅgas.

[^380]: "Householders" (*gahapati*) is literal; it means land owners.
    Thus the "brahmins and householders" (not "brahmin householders")
    were the wealthy class.

[^381]: Both the repetition below and the parallel at [MN
    95:8.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn95/en/sujato#8.3) include the
    phrase "it's appropriate that he comes to see you". It may have been
    omitted here by mistake.

[^382]: *Jātivāda* is sometimes translated as "doctrine of
    birth", but the context here shows this cannot be the case. It
    refers to the genealogical records of the family lineage.

[^383]: For Mahāsaṅgīti *vacchasī* read
   *vaccasī* (Sanskrit *varcasin*), "possessing splendor".

[^384]: Notice that the royal endowment was not just for a luxury
    residence, it was the site of a major international college. Kings
    invested in education.

[^385]: Later tradition says that the young Siddhattha sneaked out of
    his home to avoid creating such a scene, but the early texts say he
    left despite his parents' weeping.

[^386]: In contrast with some of the other ascetics in [DN
    2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato).

[^387]: This description is applied to the Buddha at [DN
    5:7.24](https://suttacentral.net/dn5/en/sujato#7.24), and to the
    corrupt but superficially charming monks Assaji and Punabbasuka at
    [Bu Ss
    13:1.3.4](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13/en/sujato#1.3.4).

[^388]: This would be the assemblies of aristocrats, brahmins,
    householders, and ascetics ([AN
    5.213:3.1](https://suttacentral.net/an5.213/en/sujato#3.1)), rather
    than the Buddha's four assemblies of monks, nuns, laymen, and
    laywomen ([AN 4.129](https://suttacentral.net/an4.129/en/sujato)).

[^389]: *Titthakara*, literally "ford-maker", is a term restricted to
    those such as the Buddha who founded a religion, or
    Mahāvīra who was a major reformer on the same level as
    a founder.

[^390]: Bimbisāra's refuge is at [Kd
    1:22.11.4](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#22.11.4).

[^391]: Pasenadi's refuge is at [SN
    3.1:14.5](https://suttacentral.net/sn3.1/en/sujato#14.5).

[^392]: This sutta must have been before the events of [DN
    2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato), but after those of [DN
    3](https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato).

[^393]: "Knapsack" is *puṭosa*, where *puṭa*
    is "bag" and *osa* is "food" (Sanskrit *avasa*). The compound is a
    dative-dependent *tappurisa* with reversal of the usual order,
    yielding the sense "bag for food".

[^394]: Even before he meets him, Soṇadaṇḍa has extensive
    knowledge of the Buddha and faith in him. It's also notable how
    Soṇadaṇḍa gives Pokkharasāti a special
    status. Perhaps Pokkharasāti told
    Soṇadaṇḍa of the encounter with Ambaṭṭha
    in [DN 3](https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato), which would
    explain his hesitation. \| Note the use of the term *yoniso* here,
    which I render "rational". The basic meaning of the term is "womb,
    source", and it is used to mean "with reason", which here has the
    sense "pertinent, relevant".

[^395]: For all his previous avowal of faith, Soṇadaṇḍa is
    merely polite, not reverential. This foreshadows the ending.

[^396]: The Buddha goes out of his way to make him comfortable.
    Soṇadaṇḍa is nervous and overly eager to please, but he
    is not contemptuous and grinding a personal ax like
    Ambaṭṭha.

[^397]: *Suja* (Sanskrit *sruc*) was a large wooden ladle for pouring
    ghee on to the sacred flame.

[^398]: The Buddha uses "Socratic method". He has the other person
    articulate a view, then leads them to refine their view, leading to
    a clearer vision of the truth.

[^399]: When the Buddha convinces Soṇadaṇḍa, he does not
    crow over it or take pleasure in his discomfort, but praises his
    wisdom and affirms his conclusions.

[^400]: The Buddha has taken pains to establish common ground, but
    Soṇadaṇḍa's description of wisdom is lacking, so the
    Buddha prompts a deeper inquiry.

[^401]: Normally, the Buddha frames his teaching as ethics, meditation,
    and wisdom, but here he adapts to Soṇadaṇḍa's framing
    and places meditation under wisdom.

[^402]: Soṇadaṇḍa's attachment to his reputation betrays
    his lack of inner confidence and stands in contrast with
    Pokkharasāti. Perhaps it may also be read as a regional
    characteristic, since Buddhism was less well established in the
    Aṅga region than in central Magadha.

[^403]: When asked about sacrifice, the Buddha tells a story of how a
    king was persuaded to forgo cruelty and institute a constructive
    social policy of welfare instead.

[^404]: Khāṇumata is only mentioned here. It means
    "stumpy", perhaps indicating that it was, or had recently been, a
    rough out-of-the-way place.

[^405]: The commentary says this was similar to the
    Ambalaṭṭhikā of [DN
    1:1.2.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#1.2.1).

[^406]: Like the town Khāṇumata, the brahmin
    Kūṭadanta appears only here. His name means "pointy
    teeth", but there is no evidence that he was a vampire.

[^407]: At [Snp
    2.7:26.1](https://suttacentral.net/snp2.7/en/sujato#26.1), the
    sacrifice of cows in particular was said to be the nadir of decline
    for brahmins. When similar sacrifices are described elsewhere in the
    canon, the number is five hundred rather than seven hundred ([SN
    3.9:1.2](https://suttacentral.net/sn3.9/en/sujato#1.2), [AN
    7.47:1.2](https://suttacentral.net/an7.47/en/sujato#1.2)).

[^408]: News of the Buddha had spread in Brahmanical circles. In [DN
    3](https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato) we saw the Buddha use his
    rhetorical technique of adapting his teaching to reframe Brahmanical
    doctrines in order to establish a common ground. Here we see the
    downside to such techniques, as the details of the reframing have
    been lost.

[^409]: No such sacrifice has been identified in Brahmanical texts.

[^410]: Kūṭadanta's proposal that the Buddha advise him on
    the sacrifice of 700 animals is outrageous. Nonetheless, the Buddha
    responds politely since Kūṭadanta is being polite.
    While it is tempting to see the sacrifice of animals by supposedly
    virtuous priests as sheer hypocrisy, the fact of sacrifice remains
    one of the most widespread and mysterious of human religious
    practices. In an empathetic work that addresses this squarely,
    Roberto Calasso's *Ardor* sees the vast complex of Vedic ritual and
    theory as making plain the fact of killing so that the guilt may be
    contained, in contrast with our modern culture of killing on an
    industrial scale while hiding it out of sight.

[^411]: Mahāvijita means "Great Dominion". He seems to be
    only known from this story. The idiom *bhūtapubbaṁ*
    (literally "so it was in the past") introduces legendary narratives
    of usually dubious historicity, like the English idiom "once upon a
    time".

[^412]: In the Pali, meaningful thoughts often occur to people when
    withdrawn in seclusion. This doesn't necessary mean they were in
    formal meditation.

[^413]: The great sacrifices, especially the horse sacrifice, ensured
    royal authority. Their very scale and wastefulness showed off the
    wealth of the king.

[^414]: "High priest" is *purohita*. He was a family chaplain advising
    and consecrating the royal family. The closeness of the relationship
    is shown by the fact that the royal family would take the lineage
    name of the *purohita*.

[^415]: Then, as today, government policy was driven by the perception
    of rising crime rate. This whole passage is one of the Buddha's most
    important statements on public policy. It is expressed through
    storytelling, giving a good example of how myths were invoked---and
    subverted---as rationales for current policy.

[^416]: "Taxes" is *bali*. He would have had to press his people for the
    extra funds to hold the sacrifice.

[^417]: "Plague of savages" (*dassukhīla*) is the only
    occurrence of Sanskrit *dasyu* in early Pali. The *dasyu* were
    inveterate foes of the Aryans in the Vedic period. Bereft of
    civilizing rites, scriptures, and observances, they were no children
    of Manu (Rig Veda 10.22.8). Their wiles (*māyā*) made
    them a potent threat (Rig Veda 4.16.9, 8.14.14, 10.73.5). Indra was
    invoked to ensure their destruction (Rig Veda *passim*; Atharva Veda
    2.14.5, 4.32.3, 20.21.4, 20.37.5, 20.42.2). Legend has it that Agni
    and Soma first supported the *dasyu* before being won over by Indra
    (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.6.3.13; see also 6.4.2.4). By the
    time of the Buddha the *dasyu* have vanished except as a legendary
    foe of the past. Where the Brahmanical texts advocate the pitiless
    destruction of the *dasyu*, the brahmin high priest in the Buddhist
    text advocates an inclusive policy of social welfare.

[^418]: The priest knows that the king will respond better to a
    pragmatic argument than a moral one.

[^419]: Effective social policy requires a forward-thinking plan, not
    just reacting to grievances.

[^420]: The king should spend his own resources to support his citizens
    in the various occupations.

[^421]: Here the priest identifies a fundamental cause of social unrest
    and disorder.

[^422]: The king spends out of pocket, but the economy flourishes, so
    tax revenues increase even though he has not raised taxes. This is
    the essence of Keynesian economic theory.

[^423]: *Khema* means a place of safety and sanctuary, where both humans
    and animals have no fear.

[^424]: A good leader listens to advice.

[^425]: Here the phrase "of both town and country" qualifies each group.
    At [AN 4.70:1.3](https://suttacentral.net/an4.70/en/sujato#1.3),
    however, "brahmins and householders" and "people of town and
    country" are separate groups of people. Elsewhere the context does
    not always decide between these two possibilities. Generally the
    idiom aims at inclusivity, as opposed to here where the king is
    consulting the rich and powerful, so I treat them as two separate
    groups, thus including the common folk.

[^426]: "Consenting factions" is *anumatipakkhā*. The king
    governs with the consent of his people, although only the landowning
    classes are considered.

[^427]: Royal authority is not based just on birth, conquest, ritual, or
    power, but on quality of character.

[^428]: Read *sahati* ("prevails") over the several variants.

[^429]: Showing the importance of comprehension over blind adherence to
    tradition.

[^430]: Meditators focus on the present, but that does not mean they
    cannot think about the past or future; it just means they are not
    trapped in useless thoughts.

[^431]: These are four of the five qualities that Soṇadaṇḍa
    identifies as the qualities of a brahmin at [DN
    4:13.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn4/en/sujato#13.2). Missing is
    appearance, which is the first factor that Soṇadaṇḍa
    admits is unnecessary.

[^432]: Compare the three factors of a donor's mind-state at [AN
    6.37:2.4](https://suttacentral.net/an6.37/en/sujato#2.4).

[^433]: What a recipient does with a gift is beyond the donor's control.

[^434]: PTS edition acknowledges *sajjata* only as a variant reading,
    but it is in the commentary, so should be accepted in the text. It
    is from √*sajj* (relinquish).

[^435]: Another lesson in leadership: the importance of communication.

[^436]: Due to abbreviation, the text only mentions householders here,
    but clearly all are intended.

[^437]: A leader gets results through inspiration, not fear.

[^438]: These were regarded as valuable yet harmless products.

[^439]: The king's generosity and sincerity brings out the best in the
    others.

[^440]: Here ends the Buddha's legendary account of the past.

[^441]: The other brahmins are satisfied, but Kūṭadanta
    senses there is more to it.

[^442]: "So I have heard" (*evaṁ me sutaṁ*) is
    the standard opening for Buddhist suttas. This tag was used to
    indicate that the speaker was not present at the events, but "heard"
    about them. This is in contrast with the phrase "I heard and learned
    this in the presence" (*sammukhā sutaṁ,
    sammukhā paṭiggahitaṁ*), which is used
    when reporting a teaching heard directly from the Buddha, eg. [SN
    55.52:5.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn55.52/en/sujato#5.1), [SN
    22.90:9.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.90/en/sujato#9.1), [MN
    47:10.7](https://suttacentral.net/mn47/en/sujato#10.7), etc.

[^443]: This qualifies the story of Mahāvijita as an early
    canonical Jātaka. There are a small number of such
    stories in the early suttas, only some of which overlap with the
    later Jātaka collections, the story of
    Mahāvijita not being among them.

[^444]: Kūṭadanta is hoping for a better return on his
    investment. Throughout the suttas, we find a strain of what might be
    called "spiritual economics".

[^445]: Mentioned in a similar context at [AN
    4.40:2.2](https://suttacentral.net/an4.40/en/sujato#2.2).

[^446]: This contradicts the description given above.

[^447]: This means that the dwelling could be used by any
    Saṅgha member, as opposed to being given to a
    particular monastic or group. The gift of a dwelling is regarded as
    the best kind of offering to the Saṅgha.

[^448]: Thus far the Buddha has described the regular practice of a
    Buddhist lay person.

[^449]: The entire path may be described as a "sacrifice".

[^450]: Releasing animals remains a Buddhist practice today.

[^451]: Lying some 60 kilometers north of Pāṭaliputra
    (Patna), Vesālī was the largest city in the Vajji
    Federation, a republican league in the region north of the Ganges.

[^452]: In the earlier suttas of this chapter, we have seen how news of
    the Buddha spread, evidently following Pokkharasāti's
    conversion. Here we see an example of the kind of meeting at which
    such news would be discussed. \| The phrase "brahmin emissaries"
    (*brāhmaṇadūtā*) does not seem to occur elsewhere and
    is not explained in the commentary. Perhaps they were emissaries of
    the kings, meeting in a neutral location. Or perhaps they were
    emissaries of their respective communities of brahmins.

[^453]: This monastery features prominently as the Buddha's usual place
    of residence near Vesālī.

[^454]: At some times the Buddha would go on retreat and ask that no-one
    visit him except to bring food; this sometimes happened at the Great
    Wood ([SN 54.9:2.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn54.9/en/sujato#2.1)).
    He also had the habit of withdrawing into the wood itself for
    meditation ([AN
    5.58:1.3](https://suttacentral.net/an5.58/en/sujato#1.3)). At this
    time, however, he was simply staying in a nearby hut, so it seems
    Nāgita is being over-zealous.

[^455]: Oṭṭhaddha mean "hare-lip" and is evidently a
    nickname or epithet. Throughout, the Buddha refers to him by his
    personal name, Mahāli. And it is under that name we
    meet him again in [SN
    11.13](https://suttacentral.net/sn11.13/en/sujato) and [SN
    22.60](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.60/en/sujato). \| The
    Licchavis, whose name is derived from "bear", dominated the Vajji
    Federation. Note that the Mahāsaṅgīti edition here
    spells the masculine singular as *licchavī*, whereas
    normally it is *licchavi*.

[^456]: This Sīha is unknown elsewhere.

[^457]: Kassapa is Nāgita's clan name; either he was a
    brahmin or a *khattiya* whose family chaplain (*purohita*) was a
    Kassapa.

[^458]: In trying to protect the Buddha, Nāgita was
    inflexible and lacking compassion. When given good advice by
    Sīha, he responded gracelessly, fobbing off
    responsibility to a junior. No wonder he was replaced by Ānanda.

[^459]: This is still a common place for forest monks to receive guests.

[^460]: This is the last we hear of these emissaries.

[^461]: Sunakkhatta features in several suttas, through which his
    journey may be traced. In [MN
    105](https://suttacentral.net/mn105/en/sujato) he meets the Buddha
    and gains faith; here in [DN
    6](https://suttacentral.net/dn6/en/sujato) he is becoming
    dissatisfied; in [DN 24](https://suttacentral.net/dn24/en/sujato) he
    rejects the Buddha; and in [MN
    12](https://suttacentral.net/mn12/en/sujato) he attacks the Buddha
    after disrobing.

[^462]: This refers to "clairvoyance" and "clairaudience", sometimes
    translated as the "divine eye" and "divine ear". Despite being
    included in the Gradual Training, they are not a goal of Buddhist
    practice. Rather, they are unnecessary but potentially useful, as
    they reveal dimensions of being inaccessible to ordinary
    consciousness. Sunakkhatta, however, was evidently just interested
    in having pleasant supersensory experiences.

[^463]: This must have wounded his pride.

[^464]: This description of meditation is unique in the Pali canon. The
    Buddha answers Mahāli's question directly, even though
    the premise betrays Sunakkhatta's limited understanding. When a
    questioner is sincere, answering directly shows respect and builds
    trust.

[^465]: Having directly answered the original question, the Buddha
    reframed the issue on request.

[^466]: This is the first description of the four stages of awakening
    which are featured throughout the Pali canon. The three fetters are
    identity view, doubt, and misapprehension of precepts and
    observances ([MN
    2:11.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn2/en/sujato#11.3)).

[^467]: The five lower fetters are the three mentioned above, plus
    sensual desire and ill will ([AN
    10.13:1.5](https://suttacentral.net/an10.13/en/sujato#1.5)). This is
    the non-returner, who spends their last life in an exalted
    Brahmā realm. \| A "spontaneous" rebirth is one that
    occurs without gestation in the womb, like most *devas*, or for that
    matter, Boltzmann brains.

[^468]: This is the arahant, the "worthy" or "perfected" one. Elsewhere
    it is said they abandon the five higher fetters: desire for rebirth
    in the realm of luminous form, desire for rebirth in the formless
    realm, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance ([AN
    10.13:2.2](https://suttacentral.net/an10.13/en/sujato#2.2)).

[^469]: This is the most fundamental of the Buddha's teachings on the
    path, declared in his first sermon ([SN
    56.11](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11/en/sujato)). It reappears in
    [DN 8:13.5](https://suttacentral.net/dn8/en/sujato#13.5), [DN
    19:61.7](https://suttacentral.net/dn19/en/sujato#61.7), and [DN
    22:21.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn22/en/sujato#21.2).

[^470]: The eight factors map roughly on to the Gradual Training thus:
    hearing the Dhamma gives rise to right view; the choice to renounce
    is right thought; ethics includes right speech, action, and
    livelihood; undertaking seclusion and sense restraint is right
    effort; developing meditation is right mindfulness; and gaining the
    four *jhānas* is right immersion. Realization of the
    Dhamma completes the circle by deepening conceptual right view to
    liberating insight. Sometimes this is expressed by adding two
    further factors, right knowledge and right liberation.

[^471]: The Buddha retells the events recorded in the next sutta, [DN
    7](https://suttacentral.net/dn7/en/sujato).

[^472]: Muṇḍiya means "shaven one"; his name is spelled
    Mandissa in some manuscripts. He appears only in this passage.
    Jāliya returns in [DN
    24:2.4.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn24/en/sujato#2.4.1), which
    recounts the farcical events following Sunakkhatta's disrobal. There
    he takes the Buddha's part against the delusional
    Pāṭikaputta favored by Sunakkhatta.

[^473]: The term "soul" (*jīva*) was favored by the
   *samaṇas*, as opposed to the "self"
    (*attā*) of the brahmins. Both are rejected by the
    Buddha as forms of "metaphysical" self: they postulate the absolute,
    eternal existence of entities that cannot be established
    empirically. The repeated demonstrative pronouns (*taṁ
    jīvaṁ taṁ sarīraṁ*) assert an
    emphatic identity.

[^474]: They evidently believed that the experience of
    jhāna would grant insight into this dilemma. But it is
    a loaded question: it assumes that the soul is real and that what
    needs determining is its relation to the body.

[^475]: Until this point, none of the experiences described are
    fundamentally incompatible with the notion of an eternal
    metaphysical self. Buddhists believe that non-Buddhists, before and
    after the Buddha, are quite capable of realizing such states.
    However, they would tend to interpret them in line with their
    previous beliefs, thus reinforcing their theories of self. Faced
    with the end of all rebirth, however, no theory of eternal self can
    stand.

[^476]: This sutta depicts the events that were subsequently related by
    the Buddha in the previous sutta, [DN
    6](https://suttacentral.net/dn6/en/sujato).

[^477]: Ujuññā was a Kosalan town at which King Pasenadi
    visited the Buddha in [MN
    90](https://suttacentral.net/mn90/en/sujato). \| "Deer parks" were
    nature reservations where the animals were safe from hunters.

[^478]: Naked ascetics are still found in India today. Some Jains went
    naked, but if he were a Jain he would have been introduced as such.
    Kassapa is an ancient clan name of the brahmins, and we meet four
    naked ascetics named Kassapa in the canon (here, [SN
    12.17](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.17/en/sujato), [SN
    41.9](https://suttacentral.net/sn41.9/en/sujato), and [MN
    124](https://suttacentral.net/mn124/en/sujato)). They cannot be the
    same person, for at the end of each account it is said they went
    forth and attained arahantship.

[^479]: In his first sermon, the Buddha rejected extremes of
    self-mortification. There the term was *attakilamatha*
    ("self-mortification"), whereas here it is *tapas* ("heat, burning,
    fervor"). These refer to the same practices, but *tapas* points to
    the fervent ardor of the practitioner, generating an inner heat that
    "burns off" the corrupting traces of *kamma* and defilements. This
    topic is also discussed in [AN
    10.94](https://suttacentral.net/an10.94/en/sujato).

[^480]: While the self-mortification itself may be useless, the person
    who practices it may have other good qualities. The Buddha is
    cautioning against rash judgement.

[^481]: Again we see the Buddha's preferred method of establishing
    common ground first, then building an argument from there.

[^482]: Rather than logical hair-splitting, the Buddha recommends
    looking at a person's conduct.

[^483]: Here *-va* has an exclusive sense (= *eva*). Compare [Dhp
    274](https://suttacentral.net/dhp274/en/sujato): *eseva maggo
    natthañño* ("This is the path, there is no other").

[^484]: Compare [DN
    16:5.27.1](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#5.27.1).

[^485]: What follows is a description of ascetic practices undertaken by
    the Jains and similar groups. \| The phrase "course of fervent
    mortification" (*tapopakkama*) is unique to this sutta. *Pakkama*
    means "stepping out".

[^486]: Buddhist mendicants may not receive food in their hands, nor
    lick them while eating. Followers of the practices listed here would
    have walked steadily and randomly for alms, accepting only what was
    given at the time.

[^487]: Keeping sheep (*eḷaka*, for slaughter) goes against
    the Jain principle of non-violence, as does keeping weapons
    (*daṇḍa*). \| A *musala* often means "pestle", but it
    can also be a "shovel"; at [MN
    81:18.12](https://suttacentral.net/mn81/en/sujato#18.12) it is
    regarded as a virtue to not use one to dig the soil (which is
    regarded as being alive in Jainism). \| *Thusodaka* is an alcoholic
    porridge fermented from grain-husks, mentioned alongside
   *sovīraka* in the Pali commentaries and
    Carakasaṁhitā 27g.191.

[^488]: It is not easy to meaningfully distinguish the various kinds of
    grain.

[^489]: All are extremely uncomfortable. Christian ascetics wore a "hair
    shirt" in order to "mortify the flesh" .

[^490]: Jain ascetics tear out their hair at ordination, rather than
    shaving.

[^491]: Remaining in one posture for months or years at a time is one of
    the most difficult practices.

[^492]: Strict Jain ascetics did not bathe.

[^493]: At [Kd
    6:14.6.3](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/sujato#14.6.3) the
    four "great unnaturals" (or "filthy edibles",
   *mahāvikaṭa*) are said to be feces, urine, ash, and
    clay. At [MN 12:49.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn12/en/sujato#49.3)
    the Buddha said he ate the "unnatural things" of feces and urine
    when undertaking ascetic practices.

[^494]: This seems out of place here. It was a Brahmanical practice ([SN
    7.21](https://suttacentral.net/sn7.21/en/sujato)), as the Jains
    refused to bathe at all. Indeed, bathing three times a day in the
    Indian climate would, for most of the year, be quite pleasant.

[^495]: The term "accomplishment in mind" (*cittasampadā*)
    is equivalent to "accomplishment in immersion"
    (*samādhisampadā*). More generally, when *citta* is
    used in the context of meditation, it is normally a synonym of
   *samādhi*.

[^496]: *Mettā* is universal love and good will free from
    attachment. As well as being a foundation for good character and
    healthy emotional development, it serves to lead the mind into deep
    meditation of *jhāna*.

[^497]: The Buddha was criticized for going soft after abandoning
    austere practices, but here he flips the script, arguing that it is
    inner transformation that is really hard, not outer shows of
    mortification.

[^498]: Note that the heading for this section in the
    Mahāsaṅgīti edition uses *samādhi* rather
    than *citta*. Headings were added by later editors, and are not part
    of the original text.

[^499]: This is the ethical practices as described in the Gradual
    Training.

[^500]: "Mortification in disgust of sin" renders
   *tapojigucchā*; *tapo* is "fervent mortification" and
   *jigucchā* is "loathing, disgust". It captures the
    severity with which practitioners regarded the "evil" or "sin" with
    which they were infected, like a quasi-physical stain on the soul,
    and the burning flame of white-hot pain required to cauterize their
    spiritual wounds.

[^501]: The Buddha repurposes the concept of "disgust of sin", which
    here stands in the place of meditation (*samādhi*).

[^502]: A "lion's roar" is an unapologetic proclamation of spiritual
    supremacy.

[^503]: The Buddha is referring to the events of the Udumbarikasutta
    ([DN 25](https://suttacentral.net/dn25/en/sujato)). There Nigrodha
    is referred to as a "wanderer" (*paribbājaka*) who
    according to the commentary was clothed. The term
   *tapabrahmacārī* here is unique and is not explained in
    the commentary. I think it means he was a celibate student of a
    Brahmanical teacher.

[^504]: This probation is laid down in the Vinaya at [Kd
    1:38.1.5](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#38.1.5). The
    candidate shaves, dons the robes, takes refuge, and asks for
    probation. They must show good conduct and restraint, diligence in
    duties, and enthusiasm for the Buddha's teachings and practice.

[^505]: In addition to individual exceptions, there are general
    exceptions for dreadlocked ascetics, since they believe in kamma,
    and for the Buddha's relatives.

[^506]: Poṭṭhapāda appears only here; he was named for a
    month of the lunar calendar (August/September). \|
    Mallikā was the chief queen of Pasenadi, and her hall
    is mentioned in a similar context at [MN
    78:1.3](https://suttacentral.net/mn78/en/sujato#1.3). The commentary
    explains that the brahmins, Jains, and others would assemble there
    to "debate their beliefs" (*samayaṁ pavadanti*).
    Evidently the monastery grounds had accommodation for many ascetics
    of different beliefs, but only "one hall" where they would gather
    for debate. We hear many times of such debates, but here we catch a
    glimpse of a place that was set up to facilitate them. For
   *-ācīra*, read in the sense of "boundary, hedge"
    (commentary: *timbarūrukkhapantiyā
    parikkhittattā*; cf. Sanskrit *prācīra*,
    "enclosure, hedge, fence, wall").

[^507]: According to the commentary, when he approached the vicinity of
    the city gate, he decided to check the position of the sun and
    noticed that it was too early to enter. The commentary and
    sub-commentary explain that it only sounds like the Buddha was in
    doubt, for Buddhas deliberate before deciding on a course of action.

[^508]: This can be understood as answering the criticism voiced in [DN
    8:22.2](https://suttacentral.net/dn8/en/sujato#22.2), that the
    Buddha was afraid to speak in an assembly.

[^509]: In contrast with the silence of the Buddha's community at [DN
    2:10.7](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#10.7).

[^510]: The Buddha encourages quiet for the sake of mental development;
    Poṭṭhapāda does it for the sake of reputation.

[^511]: Poṭṭhapāda's address is almost overly deferential.

[^512]: Always polite, the Buddha begins by showing an interest in them.

[^513]: *Abhisaññā* does not appear elsewhere. Here the
    prefix *abhi-* means not "higher", but rather "about, concerning".
    Compare *abhidhamma* at [MN
    32:8.6](https://suttacentral.net/mn32/en/sujato#8.6): *dve
    bhikkhū abhidhammakathaṁ kathenti* ("two
    mendicants engage in discussion about the teaching"); also
   *abhivinaya* at [AN
    3.140:4.4](https://suttacentral.net/an3.140/en/sujato#4.4). The
    commentary here says *abhi-* is a mere particle, so it need not be
    translated.

[^514]: This discussion appears to have been directly sparked by the
    difficult passage in Bṛhadāraṇyaka
    Upaniṣad 2.4.12 and 4.5.13. The sage
    Yājñavalkya, teaching his wife Maitreyī,
    says that the true Self is a sheer mass of "consciousness"
    (*vijñāna*, Pali *viññāṇa*), which is
    "great, endless, infinite reality". After realizing this, he says,
    there is no "perception" (*saṁjñā*, Pali
   *saññā*), a statement that bewilders even the wise
    Maitreyī. He explains that only in an apparent state of
    duality (*dvaitamiva*) do the separate functions of sense
    consciousness operate. When all is realized as the Self, how, he
    asks, can one know that owing to which all this is known? He is
    implicitly distinguishing between *viññāna* as
    "infinite" (= *vi-*) knowing and *saññā* as
    "constrained" (*saṁ-*) knowing.
    Yājñavalkya says the separate Self emerges with these
    elements and vanishes with them (*etebhyo bhūtebhyaḥ
    samutthāya tānyevānu
    vinaśyati*), but he does not explain how or why this
    happens, which is the question the theorists here attempt to
    address.

[^515]: Here perception is not identified with the "person" (*purisa*),
    but rather belongs to them (cf. *etaṁ mama*, "this is
    mine"). In the discussion to follow, the Buddha only directly
    addresses this theory, while the remainder are included by
    inference.

[^516]: This idiom is also at [SN
    47.19:1.10](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.19/en/sujato#1.10).

[^517]: The self is defined as perception (*eso me attā*),
    one of the five aggregates. Compare the various theories of the self
    and perception at [DN
    1:2.38.0](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#2.38.0).

[^518]: Implying that at such times a person lacks a "self". This is
    perhaps related to Yājñavalkya's: "That man, when born,
    acquiring a body, is connected with ills (the bodily organs); and
    when he dies, departing, he discards those ills"
    (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.8).

[^519]: The commentary says these were devotees of
   *āthabbaṇa*, i.e the practices preserved in the
    Atharvaveda. This "fourth Veda" is mentioned only once by name in
    the early Pali ([Snp
    4.14:13.1](https://suttacentral.net/snp4.14/en/sujato#13.1)), where,
    as here, it is associated with the performance of magic and the
    casting of spells. The commentary fairly drips with contempt:
    "Allegedly, the Āthabbaṇa practitioners cast a spell,
    showing a creature's head as if cut off, or their hand as if cut
    off, or as if dead. Then they show them back to normal; imagining
    so, they say, 'From cessation they have arisen.'"

[^520]: See [DN 29:16.20](https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato#16.20)
    for *upakaḍḍhati* and *apakaḍḍhati* in
    this sense.
