# DN 19 The Great Steward

_**Mahāgovindasutta**_

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, on the Vulture's Peak Mountain.

Then, late at night, the centaur Pañcasikha, lighting up
the entire Vulture's Peak, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one
side, and said to him,[^628] "Sir, I would tell you of what I heard and
learned directly from the gods of the thirty-three."

"Tell me, Pañcasikha," said the Buddha.

## 1. The Council of the Gods

"Sir, it was more than a few days ago---on the fifteenth day sabbath on
the full moon day at the invitation to admonish held at the end of the
rainy season---when all the gods of the thirty-three were sitting
together in the Hall of Justice.[^629] A large assembly of gods was
sitting all around, and the four great kings were seated at the four
quarters.

The Great King Dhataraṭṭha was seated to the east, facing
west, in front of his gods. The Great King Virūḷhaka was
seated to the south, facing north, in front of his gods. The Great King
Virūpakkha was seated to the west, facing east, in front of
his gods. The Great King Vessavaṇa was seated to the north,
facing south, in front of his gods.

When the gods of the thirty-three have a gathering like this, that is
how they are seated. After that come our seats.

Sir, those gods who had been recently reborn in the company of the
thirty-three after leading the spiritual life under the Buddha outshine
the other gods in beauty and glory. The gods of the thirty-three became
uplifted and overjoyed at that, full of rapture and happiness, saying,
'The heavenly hosts swell, while the titan hosts dwindle!'

Seeing the joy of those gods, Sakka, lord of gods, celebrated with these
verses:

> 'The gods rejoice---\
> the thirty-three with their Lord---\
> revering the Realized One,\
> and the natural excellence of the teaching;
>
> and seeing the new gods,\
> so beautiful and glorious,\
> who have come here after leading\
> the spiritual life under the Buddha!
>
> They outshine the others\
> in beauty, glory, and lifespan.\
> Here are the distinguished disciples\
> of he whose wisdom is vast.
>
> Seeing this, they delight---\
> the thirty-three with their Lord---\
> revering the Realized One,\
> and the natural excellence of the teaching!'

The gods of the thirty-three became even more uplifted and overjoyed at
that, full of rapture and happiness, saying, 'The heavenly hosts swell,
while the titan hosts dwindle!'

## 2. Eight Genuine Praises

Seeing the joy of those gods, Sakka, lord of gods, addressed them,
'Gentlemen, would you like to hear eight genuine praises of the
Buddha?'[^630]

'Indeed we would, sir.'

Then Sakka proffered these eight genuine praises of the Buddha:[^631]

'What do the good gods of the thirty-three think?[^632] How the Buddha
has acted for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy
for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and
humans! I don't see any Teacher, past or present, who has such sympathy
for the world, apart from the Buddha.

Also, the Buddha has explained the teaching well---apparent in the
present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so
that sensible people can know it for themselves. I don't see any
Teacher, past or present, who explains such a relevant teaching, apart
from the Buddha.

Also, the Buddha has well described what is skillful and what is
unskillful,[^633] what is blameworthy and what is blameless, what should
be cultivated and what should not be cultivated, what is inferior and
what is superior, and what is on the side of dark and the side of
bright. I don't see any Teacher, past or present, who so clearly
describes all these things, apart from the Buddha.

Also, the Buddha has well described the practice that leads to
extinguishment for his disciples. And extinguishment converges with the
practice,[^634] as the waters of the Ganges come together and converge
with the waters of the Yamuna.[^635] I don't see any Teacher, past or
present, who so clearly describes the practice that leads to
extinguishment for his disciples, apart from the Buddha.

Also, possessions and popularity have accrued to the Buddha, so much
that you'd think it would thrill even the aristocrats. But he takes his
food free of vanity.[^636] I don't see any Teacher, past or present, who
takes their food so free of vanity, apart from the Buddha.

Also, the Buddha has gained companions, both trainees who are
practicing, and those with defilements ended who have completed their
journey.[^637] The Buddha is committed to the joy of solitude, but
doesn't send them away.[^638] I don't see any Teacher, past or present,
so committed to the joy of solitude, apart from the Buddha.

Also, the Buddha does as he says, and says as he does, thus: he does as
he says, and says as he does.[^639] I don't see any Teacher, past or
present, who so practices in line with the teaching, apart from the
Buddha.

Also, the Buddha has gone beyond doubt and got rid of indecision. He has
achieved all he wished for regarding the fundamental purpose of the
spiritual life.[^640] I don't see any Teacher, past or present, who has
achieved these things, apart from the Buddha.'

These are the eight genuine praises of the Buddha proffered by Sakka.
Hearing them, the gods of the thirty-three became even more uplifted and
overjoyed.

Then some gods thought, 'If only four fully awakened Buddhas might arise
in the world and teach the Dhamma, just like the Blessed One! That would
be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the
world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans!'

Other gods thought, 'Let alone four fully awakened Buddhas; if only
three fully awakened Buddhas, or two fully awakened Buddhas might arise
in the world and teach the Dhamma, just like the Blessed One! That would
be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the
world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans!'

When they said this, Sakka said, 'It is impossible, gentlemen, for two
perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas to arise in the same solar system
at the same time.[^641] May that Blessed One be healthy and well, and
remain with us for a long time![^642] That would be for the welfare and
happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit,
welfare, and happiness of gods and humans!'

Then the gods of the thirty-three, having considered and deliberated on
the matter for which they were seated together in the Hall of Justice,
advised and instructed the four great kings on the subject. Each one,
having been advised, stood at his own seat without departing.

> The Kings were instructed,\
> and heeded good advice.\
> With clear and peaceful minds,\
> they stood by their own seats.

Then in the northern quarter a magnificent light arose and radiance
appeared, surpassing the glory of the gods. Then Sakka, lord of gods,
addressed the gods of the thirty-three, 'As indicated by the
signs---light arising and radiance appearing---the Divinity will appear.
For this is the precursor for the appearance of the Divinity, namely
light arising and radiance appearing.'

> As indicated by the signs,\
> the Divinity will appear.\
> For this is the sign of the Divinity:\
> a light vast and great.

## 3. On Sanaṅkumāra

Then the gods of the thirty-three sat in their own seats, saying, 'We
shall find out what has caused that light, and only when we have
realized it shall we go to it.' And the four great kings did likewise.
Hearing that, the gods of the thirty-three agreed in unison, 'We shall
find out what has caused that light, and only when we have realized it
shall we go to it.'

When the divinity Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the
thirty-three, he does so after manifesting in a solid corporeal form.
For a Divinity's normal appearance is imperceptible in the visual range
of the gods of the thirty-three. When the divinity
Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the thirty-three, he
outshines the other gods in beauty and glory, as a golden statue
outshines the human form. When the divinity Sanaṅkumāra
appears to the gods of the thirty-three, not a single god in that
assembly greets him by bowing down or rising up or inviting him to a
seat. They all sit silently on their couches with their joined palms
raised, thinking, 'Now the divinity Sanaṅkumāra will sit on
the couch of whatever god he chooses.' And the god on whose couch the
Divinity sits is overjoyed and brimming with happiness, like a king on
the day of his coronation.

Seeing the joy of those gods, the divinity Sanaṅkumāra
celebrated with these verses:

> 'The gods rejoice---\
> the thirty-three with their Lord---\
> revering the Realized One,\
> and the natural excellence of the teaching;
>
> and seeing the new gods,\
> so beautiful and glorious,\
> who have come here after leading\
> the spiritual life under the Buddha!
>
> They outshine the others\
> in beauty, glory, and lifespan.\
> Here are the distinguished disciples\
> of he whose wisdom is vast.
>
> Seeing this, they delight---\
> the thirty-three with their Lord---\
> revering the Realized One,\
> and the natural excellence of the teaching!'

That is the topic on which the divinity Sanaṅkumāra spoke.
And while he was speaking on that topic, his voice had eight qualities:
it was clear, comprehensible, charming, audible, lucid, undistorted,
deep, and resonant. He makes sure his voice is intelligible as far as
the assembly goes, but the sound doesn't extend outside the assembly.
When someone has a voice like this, they're said to have the voice of
the Divinity.

Then the gods of the thirty-three said to the divinity
Sanaṅkumāra, 'Good, Great Divinity! Having appraised this,
we rejoice.[^643] And there are the eight genuine praises of the Buddha
spoken by Sakka---having appraised them, too, we rejoice.'

## 4. Eight Genuine Praises

Then the Divinity said to Sakka, 'It would be good, lord of gods, if I
could also hear the eight genuine praises of the Buddha.'

Saying, 'Yes, Great Divinity,' Sakka repeated the eight genuine praises
for him.

Hearing them, the divinity Sanaṅkumāra was uplifted and
overjoyed, full of rapture and happiness. Then the divinity
Sanaṅkumāra manifested in a solid corporeal form, taking on
the appearance of the youth Pañcasikha, and appeared to the
gods of the thirty-three. Rising into the air, he sat cross-legged in
the sky, like a strong man might sit cross-legged on a well-appointed
couch or on level ground. There he addressed the gods of the
thirty-three:

## 5. The Story of the Steward

'What do the gods of the thirty-three think about the extent of the
Buddha's great wisdom?

Once upon a time, there was a king named Disampati.[^644] He had a
brahmin high priest named the Steward.[^645] Disampati's son was the
prince named Reṇu,[^646] while the Steward's son was the
student named Jotipāla.[^647] There were Reṇu
the prince, Jotipāla the student, and six other
aristocrats; these eight became friends.

In due course the brahmin Steward passed away. At his passing, King
Disampati lamented, "At a time when I have relinquished all my duties to
the brahmin Steward and amuse myself, supplied and provided with the
five kinds of sensual stimulation, he passes away!"[^648]

When he said this, Prince Reṇu said to him, "Sire, don't
lament too much at the Steward's passing. He has a son named
Jotipāla, who is even more astute and expert than his
father. He should manage the affairs that were managed by his father."

"Is that so, my prince?"

"That is so, sire."

## 6. The Story of the Great Steward

So King Disampati addressed one of his men, "Please, mister, go to the
student Jotipāla, and say to him, 'Best wishes,
Jotipāla! You are summoned by King Disampati; he wants to
see you.'"

"Yes, Your Majesty," replied that man, and did as he was asked. Then
Jotipāla went to the king and exchanged greetings with him.

When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one
side, and the king said to him, "May you, Jotipāla, manage
my affairs---please don't turn me down! I shall appoint you to your
father's position, and anoint you as Steward."[^649]

"Yes, sir," replied Jotipāla.

So the king anointed him as Steward and appointed him to his father's
position. After his appointment, the Steward Jotipāla
managed both the affairs that his father had managed, and other affairs
that his father had not managed.[^650] He organized both the works that
his father had organized, and other works that his father had not
organized. When people noticed this they said, "The brahmin is indeed a
Steward, a Great Steward!" And that's how the student
Jotipāla came to be known as the Great Steward.

### 6.1. Dividing the Realm

Then the Great Steward went to the six aristocrats and said, "King
Disampati is old, elderly and senior, advanced in years, and has reached
the final stage of life. Who knows how long he has to live? It's likely
that when he passes away the king-makers will anoint Prince
Reṇu as king. Come, sirs, go to Prince Reṇu
and say, 'Prince Reṇu, we are your friends, dear, beloved,
and cherished. We have shared your joys and sorrows. King Disampati is
old, elderly and senior, advanced in years, and has reached the final
stage of life. Who knows how long he has to live? It's likely that when
he passes away the king-makers will anoint you as king. If you should
gain kingship, share it with us.'"

"Yes, sir," replied the six aristocrats. They went to Prince
Reṇu and put the proposal to him.

The prince replied, "Who else, sirs, in my realm ought to prosper if not
you?[^651] If I gain kingship, I will share it with you all."

In due course King Disampati passed away. At his passing, the
king-makers anointed Prince Reṇu as king. But after being
anointed, King Reṇu amused himself, supplied and provided
with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.

Then the Great Steward went to the six aristocrats and said, "King
Disampati has passed away. But after being anointed, King
Reṇu amused himself, supplied and provided with the five
kinds of sensual stimulation. Who knows the intoxicating power of
sensual pleasures? Come, sirs, go to Prince Reṇu and say,
'Sir, King Disampati has passed away, and you have been anointed as
king. Do you remember what you said?'"

"Yes, sir," replied the six aristocrats. They went to King
Reṇu and said, "Sir, King Disampati has passed away, and
you have been anointed as king. Do you remember what you said?"

"I remember, sirs. Who is able to neatly divide into seven equal parts
this great land, so broad in the north and narrow as the front of a cart
in the south?"[^652]

"Who else, sir, if not the Great Steward?"

So King Reṇu addressed one of his men, "Please, mister, go
to the brahmin Great Steward and say that King Reṇu summons
him."

"Yes, Your Majesty," replied that man, and did as he was asked. Then the
Great Steward went to the king and exchanged greetings with him.

When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one
side, and the king said to him, "Come, let the good Steward neatly
divide into seven equal parts this great land, so broad in the north and
narrow as the front of a cart in the south."

"Yes, sir," replied the Great Steward, and did as he was asked. All were
arranged like the fronts of carts,[^653] and right in the middle was
King Reṇu's nation.[^654]

> Dantapura for the Kaliṅgas;[^655]\
> Potana for the Assakas;[^656]\
> Māhissatī for the Avantis;[^657]\
> Roruka for the Sovīras;[^658]
>
> Mithilā for the Videhas;[^659]\
> Campā was laid out for the Aṅgas;[^660]\
> and Varanasi for the Kāsis:[^661]\
> these were laid out by the Steward.

Then those six aristocrats were delighted with their respective gains,
having achieved all they wished for, "We have received exactly what we
wanted, what we wished for, what we desired, what we yearned for."

> Sattabhū and Brahmadatta,[^662]\
> Vessabhū and Bharata,[^663]\
> Reṇu and the two Dhataraṭṭhas:\
> these were the seven Bhāratas.[^664]

_*The first recitation section is finished.*_

### 6.2. A Good Reputation

Then the six aristocrats approached the Great Steward and said,
"Steward, just as you are King Reṇu's friend, dear,
beloved, and cherished, you are also our friend. Would you manage our
affairs? Please don't turn us down!"

"Yes, sirs," replied the Great Steward. Then the Great Steward managed
the realms of the seven kings. And he taught seven well-to-do brahmins,
and seven hundred bathed initiates to recite the hymns.

After some time he got this good reputation, "The Great Steward sees the
Divinity in person! The Great Steward discusses, converses, and consults
with the Divinity in person!"[^665]

The Great Steward thought, "I have the reputation of seeing the Divinity
in person, and discussing with him in person. But I don't. I have heard
that brahmins of the past who were elderly and senior, the tutors of
tutors, said: 'Whoever goes on retreat for the four months of the rainy
season and practices the absorption on compassion sees the Divinity and
discusses with him.'[^666] Why don't I do that?"

So the Great Steward went to King Reṇu and told him of the
situation, saying, "Sir, I wish to go on retreat for the four months of
the rainy season and practice the absorption on compassion. No one
should approach me, except for the one who brings my meal."

"Please do so, Steward, at your convenience."

Then the Great Steward went to the six aristocrats to put the same
proposal, and received the same reply.

He also went to the seven well-to-do brahmins and seven hundred bathed
initiates and put to them the same proposal, adding, "Sirs, recite the
hymns in detail as you have learned and memorized them, and teach each
other how to recite."

And they too said, "Please do so, Steward, at your convenience."

Then the Great Steward went to his forty equal wives to put the same
proposal to them, and received the same reply.

Then the Great Steward had a new ceremonial hall built to the east of
his citadel, where he went on retreat for the four months of the rainy
season and practiced the absorption on compassion.[^667] And no one
approached him except the one who brought him meals.

But then, when the four months had passed, the Great Steward became
dissatisfied and anxious, "I have heard that brahmins of the past said
that whoever goes on retreat for the four months of the rainy season and
practices the absorption on compassion sees the Divinity and discusses
with him. But I neither see the Divinity nor discuss with him."

### 6.3. A Discussion With the Divinity

And then the divinity Sanaṅkumāra, knowing the Great
Steward's train of thought, as easily as a strong person would extend or
contract their arm, vanished from the realm of divinity and reappeared
in the Great Steward's presence. At that, the Great Steward became
frightened, scared, his hair standing on end, as he had never seen such
a sight before. So he addressed the divinity Sanaṅkumāra in
verse:

> "Who might you be, sir,\
> so beautiful, glorious, majestic?\
> Not knowing, I ask---\
> how am I to know who you are?"
>
> "In the realm of divinity they know me\
> as 'The Eternal Youth'.\
> All the gods know me thus,\
> and so you should know me, Steward."
>
> "A Divinity deserves a seat and water,\
> foot-salve, and sweet cakes.\
> Sir, I ask you to please accept\
> these gifts of hospitality."
>
> "I accept the gifts of hospitality\
> of which you speak.\
> I grant you the opportunity\
> to ask whatever you desire---\
> about welfare and benefit in this life,\
> or happiness in lives to come."

Then the Great Steward thought, "the divinity Sanaṅkumāra
has granted me an opportunity. Should I ask him about what is beneficial
for this life or lives to come?"

Then he thought, "I'm skilled in what is beneficial for this life, and
others even ask me about it. Why don't I ask the Divinity about the
benefit that specifically applies to lives to come?" So he addressed the
divinity Sanaṅkumāra in verse:

> "I'm in doubt, so I ask the Divinity---\
> \>who is free of doubt---\
> about things one may learn from another.\
> Standing on what, training in what\
> may a mortal reach the deathless realm of divinity?"[^668]
>
> "He among men, O brahmin,\
> \>has given up possessiveness,[^669]\
> at one, compassionate,\
> free of putrefaction, and refraining from sex.\
> Standing on that, training in that\
> a mortal may reach the deathless realm of divinity."

"Sir, I understand what 'giving up possessiveness' means.[^670] It's
when someone gives up a large or small fortune, and a large or small
family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and
go forth from the lay life to homelessness. That's how I understand
'giving up possessiveness'.

Sir, I understand what 'at one' means.[^671] It's when someone frequents
a secluded lodging---a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine,
a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of
straw. That's how I understand 'at one'.

Sir, I understand what 'compassionate' means. It's when someone
meditates spreading a heart full of compassion to one direction, and to
the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above,
below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of
compassion to the whole world---abundant, expansive, limitless, free of
enmity and ill will. That's how I understand 'compassionate'.

But I don't understand what you say about putrefaction.[^672]

> What among men, O the Divinity, is putrefaction?\
> I don't understand, so tell me, attentive one:\
> wrapped in what do people stink,\
> headed for hell, shut out of the realm of divinity?"
>
> "Anger, lies, fraud, and deceit,\
> miserliness, vanity, jealousy,\
> desire, stinginess, harassing others,[^673]\
> greed, hate, vanity, and delusion---\
> those bound to such things\
> \>are not devoid of putrefaction;\
> they're headed for hell,\
> \>shut out of the realm of divinity."

"As I understand what you say about putrefaction, it's not easy to quell
while living at home.[^674] I shall go forth from the lay life to
homelessness!"

"Please do so, Steward, at your convenience."

### 6.4. Informing King Reṇu

So the Great Steward went to King Reṇu and said, "Sir,
please now find another high priest to manage the affairs of state for
you. I wish to go forth from the lay life to homelessness. As I
understand what the Divinity says about putrefaction, it's not easy to
quell while living at home. I shall go forth from the lay life to
homelessness.

> I announce to King Reṇu,\
> the lord of the land:\
> you must learn how to rule,\
> for I no longer care for my ministry."
>
> "If you're lacking any pleasures,\
> I'll supply them for you.\
> I'll protect you from any harm,\
> for I command the nation's army.\
> You are my father, I am your son![^675]\
> O Steward, please don't leave!"
>
> "I'm lacking no pleasures,\
> and no-one is harming me.\
> I've heard a non-human voice,\
> so I no longer care for lay life."
>
> "What was that non-human like?\
> What did he say to you,\
> hearing which you would abandon\
> our house and all our people?"
>
> "Before entering this retreat,\
> I only liked to sacrifice.\
> I kindled the sacred flame,\
> strewn about with kusa grass.
>
> But then the Divinity the Eternal Youth\
> appeared to me from the realm of divinity.\
> He answered my question,\
> hearing which I no longer care for lay life."
>
> "I have faith, O Steward,\
> in that of which you speak.\
> Having heard a non-human voice,\
> what else could you do?
>
> We will follow your example,\
> Steward, be my Teacher!\
> Like a gem of beryl---\
> flawless, immaculate, beautiful---\
> that's how pure we shall live,\
> in the Steward's dispensation.

If the Steward is going forth from the lay life to homelessness, we
shall do so too. Your destiny shall be ours."

### 6.5. Informing the Six Aristocrats

Then the Great Steward went to the six aristocrats and said, "Good sirs,
please now find another high priest to manage the affairs of state for
you. I wish to go forth from the lay life to homelessness. As I
understand what the Divinity says about putrefaction, it's not easy to
quell while living at home. I shall go forth from the lay life to
homelessness!"

Then the six aristocrats withdrew to one side and thought up a plan,
"These brahmins are greedy for wealth. Why don't we try to persuade him
with wealth?"

They returned to the Great Steward and said, "In these seven kingdoms
there is abundant wealth. We'll get you as much as you want."

"Enough, sirs. I already have abundant wealth, owing to my lords. Giving
up all that, I shall go forth."

Then the six aristocrats withdrew to one side and thought up a plan,
"These brahmins are greedy for women. Why don't we try to persuade him
with women?"

They returned to the Great Steward and said, "In these seven kingdoms
there are many women. We'll get you as many as you want."

"Enough, sirs. I already have forty equal wives. Giving up all them, I
shall go forth."

"If the Steward is going forth from the lay life to homelessness, we
shall do so too. Your destiny shall be ours."

> "If you all give up sensual pleasures,\
> to which ordinary people are attached,\
> exert yourselves, being strong,\
> and possessing the power of patience.
>
> This path is the straight path,\
> this path is supreme.\
> Guarded by the good, the true teaching[^676]\
> leads to rebirth in the realm of divinity."[^677]

"Well then, sir, please wait for seven years. When seven years have
passed, we shall go forth with you. Your destiny shall be ours."

"Seven years is too long, sirs. I cannot wait that long. Who knows what
will happen to the living? We are heading to the next life. We must be
thoughtful and wake up! We must do what's good and lead the spiritual
life, for no-one born can escape death.[^678] I shall go forth."

"Well then, sir, please wait for six years, five years, four years,
three years, two years, one year, seven months, six months, five months,
four months, three months, two months, one month, or even a fortnight.
When a fortnight has passed, we shall go forth. Your destiny shall be
ours."

"A fortnight is too long, sirs. I cannot wait that long. Who knows what
will happen to the living? We are heading to the next life. We must be
thoughtful and wake up! We must do what's good and lead the spiritual
life, for no-one born can escape death. As I understand what the
Divinity says about putrefaction, it's not easy to quell while living at
home. I shall go forth from the lay life to homelessness."

"Well then, sir, please wait for a week, so that we can instruct our
sons and brothers in kingship. When a week has passed, we shall go
forth. Your destiny shall be ours."

"A week is not too long, sirs. I will wait that long."

### 6.6. Informing the Brahmins

Then the Great Steward also went to the seven well-to-do brahmins and
seven hundred bathed initiates and said, "Good sirs, please now find
another tutor to teach you to recite the hymns. I wish to go forth from
the lay life to homelessness. As I understand what the Divinity says
about putrefaction, it's not easy to quell while living at home. I shall
go forth from the lay life to homelessness."

"Please don't go forth from the lay life to homelessness! The life of
one gone forth is of little influence or profit, whereas the life of a
brahmin is of great influence and profit."

"Please, good sirs, don't say that. Who has greater influence and profit
than myself? For now I am like a king to kings, like the Divinity to
brahmins, like a deity to householders. Giving up all that, I shall go
forth. As I understand what the Divinity says about putrefaction, it's
not easy to quell while living at home. I shall go forth from the lay
life to homelessness."

"If the Steward is going forth from the lay life to homelessness, we
shall do so too. Your destiny shall be ours."

### 6.7. Informing the Wives

Then the Great Steward went to his forty equal wives and said, "Ladies,
please do whatever you wish, whether returning to your own families, or
finding another husband. I wish to go forth from the lay life to
homelessness. As I understand what the Divinity says about putrefaction,
it's not easy to quell while living at home. I shall go forth from the
lay life to homelessness."

"You are the only family we want! You are the only husband we want! If
you are going forth from the lay life to homelessness, we shall do so
too. Your destiny shall be ours."[^679]

### 6.8. The Great Steward Goes Forth

When a week had passed, the Great Steward shaved off his hair and beard,
dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to
homelessness. And when he had gone forth, the seven anointed aristocrat
kings, the seven brahmins with seven hundred initiates, the forty equal
wives, and many thousands of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and
many harem women shaved off their hair and beards, dressed in ocher
robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.[^680]

Escorted by that assembly, the Great Steward wandered on tour among the
villages, towns, and capital cities. And at that time, whenever he
arrived at a village or town, he was like a king to kings, like the
Divinity to brahmins, like a deity to householders. And whenever people
sneezed or tripped over they'd say: "Homage to the Great Steward! Homage
to the high priest for the seven!"

And the Great Steward meditated spreading a heart full of love to one
direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In
the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, he spread a
heart full of love to the whole world---abundant, expansive, limitless,
free of enmity and ill will.[^681] He meditated spreading a heart full
of compassion ... rejoicing ... equanimity to one direction, and to the
second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above,
below, across, everywhere, all around, he spread a heart full of
equanimity to the whole world---abundant, expansive, limitless, free of
enmity and ill will. And he taught his disciples the path to rebirth in
the company of Divinity.

Those of his disciples who completely understood the Great Steward's
instructions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, were reborn
in the realm of divinity. Of those disciples who only partly understood
the Great Steward's instructions, some were reborn in the company of the
gods who control what is imagined by others, while some were reborn in
the company of the gods who love to imagine, or the joyful gods, or the
gods of Yama, or the gods of the thirty-three, or the gods of the four
great kings. And at the very least they swelled the hosts of the
centaurs.

And so the going forth of all those gentlemen was not in vain, was not
wasted, but was fruitful and fertile.'

Do you remember this, Blessed One?"

"I remember, Pañcasikha. I myself was the brahmin Great
Steward at that time.[^682] And I taught those disciples the path to
rebirth in the company of Divinity. But that spiritual path of mine
doesn't lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight,
awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the
realm of divinity.[^683]

But this spiritual path does lead to disillusionment, dispassion,
cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. And what is
the spiritual path that leads to extinguishment? It is simply this noble
eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right
action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right
immersion. This is the spiritual path that leads to disillusionment,
dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.

Those of my disciples who completely understand my instructions realize
the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life.
And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the
ending of defilements.

Of those disciples who only partly understand my instructions, some,
with the ending of the five lower fetters, become reborn spontaneously.
They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that
world.

Some, with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed,
hate, and delusion, become once-returners. They come back to this world
once only, then make an end of suffering.

And some, with the ending of three fetters, become stream-enterers, not
liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.

And so the going forth of all those gentlemen was not in vain, was not
wasted, but was fruitful and fertile."

That is what the Buddha said. Delighted, the centaur
Pañcasikha approved and agreed with what the Buddha said.
He bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right,
before vanishing right there.
