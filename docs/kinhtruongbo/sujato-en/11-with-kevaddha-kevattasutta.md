# DN 11 With Kevaḍḍha *Kevaṭṭasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Nāḷandā in Pāvārika's mango grove.[^581]

Then the householder Kevaḍḍha went up to the Buddha, bowed,
sat down to one side, and said to him,[^582] "Sir, this
Nāḷandā is successful and prosperous, populous, full of
people. Please direct a mendicant to perform a superhuman demonstration
of psychic power.[^583] Then Nāḷandā will become even more
devoted to the Buddha!"

When he said this, the Buddha said, "Kevaḍḍha, I do not
teach Dhamma to the mendicants like this: 'Come now, mendicants, perform
a superhuman demonstration of psychic power for the white-clothed
laypeople.'"[^584]

For a second time, Kevaḍḍha made the same request, "Sir, I
am not teaching you the Dhamma,[^585] but nonetheless I say: 'Sir, this
Nāḷandā is successful and prosperous, populous, full of
people. Please direct a mendicant to perform a superhuman demonstration
of psychic power. Then Nāḷandā will become even more
devoted to the Buddha!'" But for a second time, the Buddha gave the same
answer.

For a third time, Kevaḍḍha made the same request, at which
the Buddha said the following.

## 1. The Demonstration of Psychic Power

"Kevaḍḍha, there are three kinds of demonstration, which I
declare having realized them with my own insight.[^586] What three? The
demonstration of psychic power, the demonstration of revealing, and the
demonstration of instruction.[^587]

And what is the demonstration of psychic power? It's a mendicant who
wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and
becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unobstructed
through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in
and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were
earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and
stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful;
controlling the body as far as the realm of divinity.

Someone with faith and confidence sees that mendicant performing those
superhuman feats.

They tell someone else who lacks faith and confidence: 'Oh, how
incredible, how amazing! The ascetic has such psychic power and
might![^588] I saw him myself, performing all these superhuman feats!'

But the one lacking faith and confidence would say to them:[^589]
'There's a spell named Gandhārī.[^590] Using that a
mendicant can perform such superhuman feats.'

What do you think, Kevaḍḍha? Wouldn't someone lacking faith
speak like that?"

"They would, sir."

"Seeing this drawback in psychic power, I'm horrified, repelled, and
disgusted by demonstrations of psychic power.[^591]

<!--pg-->
## 2. The Demonstration of Revealing

And what is the demonstration of revealing?[^592] It's when a mendicant
reveals the mind, mentality, thoughts, and reflections of other beings
and individuals:[^593] 'This is what you're thinking, such is your
thought, and thus is your state of mind.'[^594]

Someone with faith and confidence sees that mendicant revealing another
person's thoughts. They tell someone else who lacks faith and
confidence: 'Oh, how incredible, how amazing! The ascetic has such
psychic power and might! I saw him myself, revealing the thoughts of
another person!'

But the one lacking faith and confidence would say to them: 'There's a
spell named Māṇikā.[^595] Using that a mendicant can reveal
another person's thoughts.'

What do you think, Kevaḍḍha? Wouldn't someone lacking faith
speak like that?"

"They would, sir."

"Seeing this drawback in revealing, I'm horrified, repelled, and
disgusted by demonstrations of revealing.

<!--pg-->
## 3. The Demonstration of Instruction

And what is the demonstration of instruction? It's when a mendicant
instructs others like this: 'Think like this, not like that. Focus your
mind like this, not like that. Give up this, and live having achieved
that.' This is called the demonstration of instruction.

Furthermore, a Realized One arises in the world ... That's how a
mendicant is accomplished in ethics. ... They enter and remain in the
first absorption ... This is called the demonstration of instruction.

They enter and remain in the second absorption ... third absorption ...
fourth absorption. This too is called the demonstration of instruction.

They project and extend the mind toward knowledge and vision ... This
too is called the demonstration of instruction.

They understand: '... there is nothing further for this place.' This too
is called the demonstration of instruction.

These, Kevaḍḍha, are the three kinds of demonstration,
which I declare having realized them with my own insight.

## 4. On the Mendicant in Search of the Cessation of Being

Once upon a time, Kevaḍḍha, a mendicant in this very
Saṅgha had the following thought,[^596] 'Where do these
four principal states cease without anything left over, namely, the
elements of earth, water, fire, and air?'[^597]

Then that mendicant attained a state of immersion such that a path to
the gods appeared.[^598] Then he approached the gods of the four great
kings and said,[^599] 'Reverends, where do these four principal states
cease without anything left over, namely, the elements of earth, water,
fire, and air?'

When he said this, those gods said to him, 'Mendicant, we too do not
know this. But the four great kings are our superiors.[^600] They might
know.'

Then he approached the four great kings and asked the same question. But
they also said to him, 'Mendicant, we too do not know this. But the gods
of the thirty-three ...[^601] Sakka, lord of gods ...[^602] the gods of
Yama ...[^603] the god named Suyāma ... the Joyful gods ...
the god named Santussita ... the gods who love to imagine ... the god
named Sunimmita ... the gods who control the creation of others ... the
god named Vasavattī ... the gods of the Divinity's host are
our superiors. They might know.'

Then that mendicant attained a state of immersion such that a path to
divinity appeared. Then he approached the gods of the Divinity's host
and said, 'Reverends, where do these four principal states cease without
anything left over, namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and
air?' But they also said to him, 'Mendicant, we too do not know
this.[^604] But there is the Divinity, the Great Divinity, the
Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power,
God Almighty, the Maker, the Creator, the First, the Begetter, the
Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be
born. He is our superior.[^605] He might know.'[^606]

'But reverends, where is that Divinity now?' 'We also don't know where
he is or what way he lies. But by the signs that are seen---light
arising and radiance appearing---we know that Divinity will appear. For
this is the precursor for the appearance of the Divinity, namely light
arising and radiance appearing.'[^607] Not long afterwards, the Great
Divinity appeared.

Then that mendicant approached the Great Divinity and said to him,
'Reverend, where do these four principal states cease without anything
left over, namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?' The
Great Divinity said to him, 'I am the Divinity, the Great Divinity, the
Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power,
God Almighty, the Maker, the Creator, the First, the Begetter, the
Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be
born.'[^608]

For a second time, that mendicant said to the Great Divinity, 'Reverend,
I am not asking you whether you are[^609] the Divinity, the Great
Divinity, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the
Wielder of Power, God Almighty, the Maker, the Creator, the First, the
Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and
those yet to be born. I am asking where these four principal states
cease without anything left over.'

For a second time, the Great Divinity said to him, 'I am the Divinity,
the Great Divinity, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal
Seer, the Wielder of Power, God Almighty, the Maker, the Creator, the
First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been
born and those yet to be born.' For a third time, that mendicant said to
the Great Divinity,[^610] 'Reverend, I am not asking you whether you are
the Divinity, the Great Divinity, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the
Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, God Almighty, the Maker, the
Creator, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those
who have been born and those yet to be born. I am asking where these
four principal states cease without anything left over.'

Then the Great Divinity took that mendicant by the arm, led him off to
one side, and said to him,[^611] 'Mendicant, these gods think that there
is nothing at all that I don't know and see and understand and realize.
That's why I didn't answer in front of them. But I too do not know where
these four principal states cease with nothing left over.[^612]
Therefore, mendicant, the misdeed is yours alone, the mistake is yours
alone, in that you passed over the Buddha and searched elsewhere for an
answer to this question. Mendicant, go to the Buddha and ask him this
question. You should remember it in line with his answer.'

Then that mendicant, as easily as a strong person would extend or
contract their arm, vanished from the realm of divinity and reappeared
in front of me. Then he bowed, sat down to one side, and said to me,
'Sir, where do these four principal states cease without anything left
over, namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?'

### 4.1. The Simile of the Land-Spotting Bird

When he said this, I said to him:

'Once upon a time, mendicant, some sea-merchants set sail for the ocean
deeps, taking with them a land-spotting bird. When their ship was out of
sight of land, they released the bird. It flew right away to the east,
the west, the north, the south, upwards, and in-between. If it saw land
on any side, it went there and stayed. But if it saw no land on any side
it returned to the ship.

In the same way, after failing to get an answer to this question even
after searching as far as the realm of divinity, you've returned to me.
Mendicant, this is not how the question should be asked: "Sir, where do
these four principal states cease without anything left over, namely,
the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?"

This is how the question should be asked:[^613]

> "Where do water and earth,[^614]\
> fire and air find no footing?\
> Where do long and short,[^615]\
> fine and coarse, beautiful and ugly;[^616]\
> where do name and form\
> cease with nothing left over?"

And the answer to that is:

> "Consciousness where nothing appears,[^617]\
> infinite, luminous all-round---[^618]\
> that's where water and earth,\
> fire and air find no footing.[^619]
>
> And that is where long and short,\
> fine and coarse, beautiful and ugly;\
> that's where name and form\
> cease with nothing left over---\
> with the cessation of consciousness,[^620]\
> that's where they cease."'"

That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the householder
Kevaḍḍha approved what the Buddha said.
