SUTTA 29

[^346]: After Devadatta had unsuccessfully attempted to kill the Buddha and usurp control of the Sangha, he broke away
from the Buddha and tried to establish his own sect with himself at the head. See Nānamoli, The Life of the Buddha, pp. 266-69.

[^347]: "Knowledge and vision" (ñānadassana) here refers to the divine eye (MA), the ability to see subtle forms invisible to normal vision.

[^348]: This translation follows the BBS and SBJ eds., which read asamayavimokkham in the preceding sentence and asamayavimuttiya in this sentence. The PTS ed., on which both Horner and $\bar{N} m$ based their translations, is evidently mistaken in reading samaya in the two compounds and thänam instead of atthānam. MA cites the Patisambhidāmagga (ii.40) for a definition of asamayavimokkha (lit., nontemporary or "perpetual" liberation) as the four paths, four fruits, and Nibbāna, and of samayavimokkha (temporary liberation) as the four jhānas and four formless attainments. See also MN 122.4.

[^349]: "Unshakeable deliverance of mind" is the fruit of arahantship (MA). Thus "perpetual liberation" - as including all four paths and fruits - has a wider range of meaning than "unshakeable deliverance of mind," which alone is declared to be the goal of the holy life.
