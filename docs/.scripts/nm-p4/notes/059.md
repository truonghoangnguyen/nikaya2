SUTTA 59

[^615]: Pañcakanga, the carpenter for King Pasenadi of Kosala, was a devoted follower of the Buddha. He reappears in MN 78 and MN 127.

[^616]: The two kinds of feeling are bodily and mental feeling, or (less commonly) the two mentioned by Pañcakanga in $ 3. The three kinds are the three mentioned by Udāyin in $ 3. The five kinds are the faculties of (bodily) pleasure, (mental) joy, (bodily) pain, (mental) grief, and equanimity. The six kinds are the feelings born of contact through the six sense faculties. The eighteen kinds are the eighteen kinds of mental exploration - exploring the six sense objects that are productive of joy, productive of grief, and
productive of equanimity (see MN 137.8). The thirty-six kinds are the thirty-six positions of beings - the six kinds of joy, grief, and equanimity each based either on the household life or on renunciation (see MN 137.9-15). The hundred and eight kinds are the previous thirty-six considered as referring to the past, present, and future.

[^617]: MA points out that by speaking of the neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling of the fourth jhāna as a kind of pleasure, the Buddha is implicitly endorsing the view put forth by Pañcakanga.

[^618]: MA: Both felt pleasure and unfelt pleasure are found (the latter being the pleasure pertaining to the attainment of cessation). The Tathāgata describes both as pleasure in the sense that they are without suffering (niddukkhabhäva).
