SUTTA 30

[^350]: These six teachers, the Buddha's senior contemporaries, all stood outside the fold of orthodox Brahmanism, and their doctrines are indicative of the speculative audacity of the Buddha's age. The six are often mentioned together in the Canon. Their teachings, as understood within the Buddhist community, are stated at DN 2.17-32/ii.52-59.

[^351]: Precisely the same question is posed to the Buddha on the eve of his Parinibbāna by the wanderer Subhadda at DN 16.5.26-27/ii.150-152.

[^352]: It is this sentence, used in place of the sentence beginning "He becomes intoxicated...," that distinguishes these passages of this sutta from the corresponding passages of the preceding sutta.

[^353]: Although the jhānas may also have been included in the attainment of concentration set forth in $ 10, and knowl-
edge and vision was described as higher than the attainment of concentration, the jhānas now become higher than knowledge and vision because they are being treated as the basis for the attainment of cessation and the destruction of the taints (in $ 21 ).
