# The Chapter on Gotamī

### AN 8.51 With Gotamī  *Gotamīsutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near
Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. Then
Mahāpajāpati Gotamī went up to the Buddha,
bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, please let females gain the going forth from the lay life to
homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized
One."

"Enough, Gotamī. Don't endorse the going forth for females
from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training
proclaimed by the Realized One."

For a second time ...

For a third time, Mahāpajāpati Gotamī said to
the Buddha:

"Sir, please let females gain the going forth from the lay life to
homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized
One."

"Enough, Gotamī. Don't endorse the going forth for females
from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training
proclaimed by the Realized One."

Then Mahāpajāpati Gotamī thought, "The Buddha
does not permit females to go forth." Miserable and sad, weeping, with a
tearful face, she bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping
him on her right, before leaving.

When the Buddha had stayed in Kapilavatthu as long as he pleased, he set
out for Vesālī. Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at
Vesālī, where he stayed at the Great Wood, in the hall with
the peaked roof. Then Mahāpajāpati Gotamī had
her hair shaved, and dressed in ocher robes. Together with several
Sakyan ladies she set out for Vesālī. Traveling stage by
stage, she arrived at Vesālī and went to the Great Wood,
the hall with the peaked roof. Then Mahāpajāpati
Gotamī stood crying outside the gate, her feet swollen, her
limbs covered with dust, miserable and sad, with tearful face.

Venerable Ānanda saw her standing there, and said to her,
"Gotamī, why do you stand crying outside the gate, your
feet swollen, your limbs covered with dust, miserable and sad, with
tearful face?"

"Honorable Ānanda, it's because the Buddha does not permit females to go
forth in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One."

"Well then, Gotamī, wait here an hour while I ask the
Buddha to grant the going forth for females."

Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to him:

"Sir, Mahāpajāpati Gotamī is standing crying
outside the gate, her feet swollen, her limbs covered with dust,
miserable and sad, with tearful face. She says that it's because the
Buddha does not permit females to go forth. Sir, please let females gain
the going forth from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and
training proclaimed by the Realized One."

"Enough, Ānanda. Don't endorse the going forth for females from the lay
life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the
Realized One."

For a second time ...

For a third time, Ānanda said to the Buddha:

"Sir, please let females gain the going forth from the lay life to
homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized
One."

"Enough, Ānanda. Don't endorse the going forth for females from the lay
life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the
Realized One."

Then Venerable Ānanda thought, "The Buddha does not permit females to go
forth. Why don't I try another approach?"

Then Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, "Sir, is a female able to
realize the fruits of stream-entry, once-return, non-return, and
perfection once she has gone forth?"

"She is able, Ānanda."

"If a female is able to realize the fruits of stream-entry, once-return,
non-return, and perfection once she has gone forth. Sir,
Mahāpajāpati has been very helpful to the Buddha. She is
his aunt who raised him, nurtured him, and gave him her milk. When the
Buddha's birth mother passed away, she nurtured him at her own breast.
Sir, please let females gain the going forth from the lay life to
homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized
One."

"Ānanda, if Mahāpajāpati Gotamī accepts these
eight principles of respect, that will be her ordination.

A nun, even if she has been ordained for a hundred years, should bow
down to a monk who was ordained that very day. She should rise up for
him, greet him with joined palms, and observe proper etiquette toward
him. This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and
venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts.

A nun should not commence the rainy season residence in a monastery
without monks. This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed,
and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts.

Each fortnight the nuns should expect two things from the community of
monks: the date of the sabbath, and visiting for advice. This principle
should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not
transgressed so long as life lasts.

After completing the rainy season residence the nuns should invite
admonition from the communities of both monks and nuns in regard to
anything that was seen, heard, or suspected. This principle should be
honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so
long as life lasts.

A nun who has committed a grave offense should undergo penance in the
communities of both monks and nuns for a fortnight. This principle
should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not
transgressed so long as life lasts.

A trainee nun who has trained in the six rules for two years should seek
ordination from the communities of both monks and nuns. This principle
should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not
transgressed so long as life lasts.

A nun should not abuse or insult a monk in any way. This principle
should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not
transgressed so long as life lasts.

From this day forth it is forbidden for nuns to criticize monks, but it
is not forbidden for monks to criticize nuns. This principle should be
honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so
long as life lasts.

If Mahāpajāpati Gotamī accepts these eight
principles of respect, that will be her ordination."

Then Ānanda, having learned these eight principles of respect from the
Buddha himself, went to Mahāpajāpati Gotamī
and said:

"Gotamī, if you accept eight principles of respect, that
will be your ordination.

A nun, even if she has been ordained for a hundred years, should bow
down to a monk who was ordained that very day. She should rise up for
him, greet him with joined palms, and observe proper etiquette toward
him. This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and
venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts. ...

From this day forth it is forbidden for nuns to criticize monks, but it
is not forbidden for monks to criticize nuns. This principle should be
honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so
long as life lasts. If you accept these eight principles of respect,
that will be your ordination."

"Ānanda, suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and
fond of adornments, and had bathed their head. After getting a garland
of lotuses, jasmine, or liana flowers, they would take them in both
hands and place them on the crown of the head. In the same way, sir, I
accept these eight principles of respect as not to be transgressed so
long as life lasts."

Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to the Buddha:

"Sir, Mahāpajāpati Gotamī has accepted the
eight principles of respect as not to be transgressed so long as life
lasts."

"Ānanda, if females had not gained the going forth from the lay life to
homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized
One, the spiritual life would have lasted long. The true teaching would
have remained for a thousand years. But since they have gained the going
forth, now the spiritual life will not last long. The true teaching will
remain only five hundred years.

It's like those families with many women and few men. They're easy prey
for bandits and thieves. In the same way, the spiritual life does not
last long in a teaching and training where females gain the going forth.

It's like a field full of rice. Once the disease called 'white bones'
attacks, it doesn't last long. In the same way, the spiritual life does
not last long in a teaching and training where females gain the going
forth.

It's like a field full of sugar cane. Once the disease called 'red rot'
attacks, it doesn't last long. In the same way, the spiritual life does
not last long in a teaching and training where females gain the going
forth.

As a man might build a dyke around a large lake as a precaution against
the water overflowing, in the same way as a precaution I've prescribed
the eight principles of respect as not to be transgressed so long as
life lasts."

### AN 8.52 An Adviser for Nuns  *Ovādasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the
Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then Venerable Ānanda went
up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:

"Sir, how many qualities should a monk have to be deemed an adviser for
nuns?"

"Ānanda, a monk with eight qualities may be deemed an adviser for nuns.
What eight?

Firstly, a monk is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting
themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger
in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they've undertaken.

They're learned, remembering and keeping what they've learned. These
teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the
end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that's
totally full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings,
remembering them, reciting them, mentally scrutinizing them, and
comprehending them theoretically.

Both monastic codes have been passed down to them in detail, well
analyzed, well mastered, well evaluated in both the rules and
accompanying material.

They're a good speaker who enunciates well. Their voice is polished,
clear, articulate, and expresses the meaning.

They're able to educate, encourage, fire up, and inspire the community
of nuns.

They're likable and agreeable to most of the nuns.

They have never previously sexually harassed any woman wearing the ocher
robe who has gone forth in the Buddha's name.

They have been ordained for twenty years or more.

A monk with these eight qualities may be deemed an adviser for nuns."

### AN 8.53 Brief Advice to Gotamī  *Saṁkhittasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the
Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then
Mahāpajāpati Gotamī went up to the Buddha,
bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I've heard
it, I'll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute."

"Gotamī, you might know that certain things lead to
passion, not dispassion; to yoking, not to unyoking; to accumulation,
not dispersal; to more desires, not fewer; to lack of contentment, not
contentment; to crowding, not seclusion; to laziness, not energy; to
being burdensome, not being unburdensome. Categorically, you should
remember these things as not the teaching, not the training, and not the
Teacher's instructions.

### AN 8.54 With Dīghajāṇu  *Dīghajāṇusutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Koliyans, where
they have a town named Kakkarapatta. Then Dīghajāṇu the
Koliyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to
the Buddha:

"Sir, we are laypeople who enjoy sensual pleasures and living at home
with our children. We use sandalwood imported from Kāsi, we
wear garlands, fragrance, and makeup, and we accept gold and currency.
May the Buddha please teach us the Dhamma in a way that leads to our
welfare and happiness in this life and in future lives."

"Byagghapajja, these four things lead to the welfare and happiness of a
gentleman in this life. What four?

Accomplishment in initiative, protection, good friendship, and balanced
finances. And what is accomplishment in initiative? It's when a
gentleman earns a living by means such as farming, trade, raising
cattle, archery, government service, or one of the professions. He
understands how to go about these things in order to complete and
organize the work. This is called accomplishment in initiative.

And what is accomplishment in protection? It's when a gentleman owns
legitimate wealth that he has earned by his own efforts and initiative,
built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow. He
ensures it is guarded and protected, thinking: 'How can I prevent my
wealth from being taken by rulers or bandits, consumed by fire, swept
away by flood, or taken by unloved heirs?' This is called accomplishment
in protection.

And what is accomplishment in good friendship? It's when a gentleman
resides in a town or village. And in that place there are householders
or their children who may be young or old, but are mature in conduct,
accomplished in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom. He associates
with them, converses and engages in discussion. And he emulates the same
kind of accomplishment in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom. This is
called accomplishment in good friendship.

And what is accomplishment in balanced finances? It's when a gentleman,
knowing his income and expenditure, balances his finances, being neither
too extravagant nor too frugal. He thinks, 'In this way my income will
exceed my expenditure, not the reverse.' It's like an appraiser or their
apprentice who, holding up the scales, knows that it's low by this much
or high by this much. In the same way, a gentleman, knowing his income
and expenditure, balances his finances, being neither too extravagant
nor too frugal. He thinks, 'In this way my income will exceed my
expenditure, not the reverse.' If a gentleman has little income but an
opulent life, people will say: 'This gentleman eats their wealth like a
fig-eater!' If a gentleman has a large income but a spartan life, people
will say: 'This gentleman is starving themselves to death!' But a
gentleman, knowing his income and expenditure, leads a balanced life,
neither too extravagant nor too frugal, thinking, 'In this way my income
will exceed my expenditure, not the reverse.' This is called
accomplishment in balanced finances.

There are four drains on wealth that has been gathered in this way.
Womanizing, drinking, gambling, and having bad friends, companions, and
associates. Suppose there was a large reservoir with four inlets and
four drains. And someone was to open up the drains and close off the
inlets, and the heavens don't provide enough rain. You'd expect that
large reservoir to dwindle, not expand. In the same way, there are four
drains on wealth that has been gathered in this way. Womanizing,
drinking, gambling, and having bad friends, companions, and associates.

There are four inlets for wealth that has been gathered in this way. Not
womanizing, drinking, or gambling, and having good friends, companions,
and associates. Suppose there was a large reservoir with four inlets and
four drains. And someone was to open up the inlets and close off the
drains, and the heavens provide plenty of rain. You'd expect that large
reservoir to expand, not dwindle. In the same way, there are four inlets
for wealth that has been gathered in this way. Not womanizing, drinking,
or gambling, and having good friends, companions, and associates.

These are the four things that lead to the welfare and happiness of a
gentleman in this life.

These four things lead to the welfare and happiness of a gentleman in
future lives. What four? Accomplishment in faith, ethics, generosity,
and wisdom.

And what is accomplishment in faith? It's when a gentleman has faith in
the Realized One's awakening: 'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully
awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of
the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods
and humans, awakened, blessed.' This is called accomplishment in faith.

And what is accomplishment in ethics? It's when a gentleman doesn't kill
living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or consume beer,
wine, and liquor intoxicants. This is called accomplishment in ethics.

And what is accomplishment in generosity? It's when a gentleman lives at
home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed,
loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.
This is called accomplishment in generosity.

And what is accomplishment in wisdom? It's when a gentleman is wise. He
has the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative,
and leads to the complete ending of suffering. This is called
accomplishment in wisdom.

These are the four things that lead to the welfare and happiness of a
gentleman in future lives.

> They're enterprising in the workplace,\
> diligent in managing things,\
> they balance their finances,\
> and preserve their wealth.
>
> Faithful, accomplished in ethics,\
> bountiful, rid of stinginess,\
> they always purify the path\
> to well-being in lives to come.
>
> And so these eight qualities\
> of a faithful householder\
> are declared by the one who is truly named\
> to lead to happiness in both spheres,
>
> welfare and benefit in this life,\
> and happiness in the future lives.\
> This is how, for a householder,\
> merit grows by generosity."

### AN 8.55 With Ujjaya  *Ujjayasutta*

Then Ujjaya the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings
with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat
down to one side and said to the Buddha:

"Mister Gotama, we wish to travel abroad. May the Buddha please teach us
the Dhamma in a way that leads to our welfare and happiness in this life
and in future lives."

"Brahmin, these four things lead to the welfare and happiness of a

### AN 8.56 Danger  *Bhayasutta*

"Mendicants, 'danger' is a term for sensual pleasures. 'Suffering',
'disease', 'boil', 'dart', 'snare', 'bog', and 'womb' are terms for
sensual pleasures. And why is 'danger' a term for sensual pleasures?
Someone who is besotted by sensual greed and shackled by lustful desire
is not freed from dangers in this life or in lives to come. That is why
'danger' is a term for sensual pleasures. And why are 'suffering',
'disease', 'boil', 'dart', 'snare', 'bog', and 'womb' terms for sensual
pleasures? Someone who is besotted by sensual greed and shackled by
lustful desire is not freed from wombs in this life or in lives to come.
That is why 'womb' is a term for sensual pleasures.

> Danger, suffering, and disease,\
> boil, dart, and snare,\
> and bogs and wombs both.\
> These describe the sensual pleasures\
> to which ordinary people are attached.
>
> Swamped by things that seem pleasant,\
> you go to another womb.\
> But when a mendicant is keen,\
