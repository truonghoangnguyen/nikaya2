# The Chapter with Upāli

### AN 10.31 With Upāli  *Upālisutta*

Then Venerable Upāli went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down
to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, for how many reasons did the Realized One lay down training rules
for his disciples and recite the monastic code?"

"Upāli, the Realized One laid down training rules for his
disciples and recited the monastic code for ten reasons. What ten? For
the well-being of the Saṅgha and for the comfort of the
Saṅgha. For keeping difficult persons in check and for the
comfort of good-hearted mendicants. For restraining defilements that
affect this life and protecting against defilements that affect lives to
come. For inspiring confidence in those without it, and increasing
confidence in those who have it. For the continuation of the true
teaching and the support of the training. The Realized One laid down
training rules for his disciples and recited the monastic code for these
ten reasons."

### AN 10.32 Suspending the Recitation of the Monastic Code  *Pātimokkhaṭṭhapanāsutta*

"Sir, how many grounds are there to suspend the recitation of the
monastic code?"

"Upāli, there are ten grounds to suspend the recitation of
the monastic code. What ten? A mendicant who has committed an expulsion
offense is sitting in the assembly. A discussion about whether someone
has committed an expulsion offense is unfinished. A person who is not
fully ordained is sitting in the assembly. A discussion about whether
someone is fully ordained or not is unfinished. Someone who has resigned
the training is sitting in the assembly. A discussion about whether
someone has rejected the training or not is unfinished. A eunuch is
sitting in the assembly. A discussion about whether someone is a eunuch
is unfinished. A raper of nuns is sitting in the assembly. A discussion
about whether or not someone is a raper of nuns is unfinished. These are
the ten grounds to suspend the recitation of the monastic code."

### AN 10.33 A Judge  *Ubbāhikāsutta*

"Sir, how many qualities should a mendicant have to be deemed a judge?"

"Upāli, a mendicant should have ten qualities to be deemed
a judge. What ten? It's when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the
monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in
suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the
rules they've undertaken. They're very learned, remembering and keeping
what they've learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in
the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing
a spiritual practice that's entirely full and pure. They are very
learned in such teachings, remembering them, rehearsing them, mentally
scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically. Both monastic
codes have been passed down to them in detail, well analyzed, well
mastered, well evaluated in both the rules and accompanying material.
They're firm and unfaltering in the training. When there are opposing
parties, they're able to persuade, advocate, and convince them, make
them see the other side and trust each other. They're skilled in raising
and settling disciplinary issues. They know what a disciplinary issue
is. They know how a disciplinary issue originates. They know how a
disciplinary issue ceases. They know the practical way leading to the
cessation of a disciplinary issue. A mendicant should have these ten
qualities to be deemed a judge."

the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in
suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the

able to dispel remorse when it has come up. They're able to rationally

### AN 10.37 Schism in the Saṅgha  *Saṁghabhedasutta*

"Sir, they speak of 'schism in the Saṅgha'. How is schism
in the Saṅgha defined?"

"Upāli, it's when a mendicant explains what is not the
teaching as the teaching, and what is the teaching as not the teaching.
They explain what is not the training as the training, and what is the
training as not the training. They explain what was not spoken and
stated by the Realized One as spoken and stated by the Realized One, and
what was spoken and stated by the Realized One as not spoken and stated
by the Realized One. They explain what was not practiced by the Realized
One as practiced by the Realized One, and what was practiced by the
Realized One as not practiced by the Realized One. They explain what was
not prescribed by the Realized One as prescribed by the Realized One,
and what was prescribed by the Realized One as not prescribed by the
Realized One. On these ten grounds they split off and go their own way.
They perform legal acts autonomously and recite the monastic code
autonomously. That is how schism in the Saṅgha is defined."

Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to the Buddha:

"Sir, they speak of 'schism in the Saṅgha'. How is schism
in the Saṅgha defined?"

Saṅgha create?"

"They create a sin that lasts for an eon."

"But sir, what is the sin that lasts for an eon?"

"They burn in hell for an eon, Ānanda.

> A schismatic remains for the eon\
> in a place of loss, in hell.\
> Taking a stand against the teaching,\
> favoring factions, they ruin their sanctuary.\
> After causing schism in a harmonious Saṅgha,\
> they burn in hell for an eon."

"But what is divine merit?"

"They rejoice in heaven for an eon, Ānanda.

> as is support for those in harmony.\
> Taking a stand on the teaching,\
> favoring harmony, they ruin no sanctuary.\
