# The Chapter on Hindrances

### N 5.51 Obstacles  *Āvaraṇasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, there are these five obstacles and hindrances, parasites of
the mind that weaken wisdom. What five? Sensual desire ... Ill will ...
Dullness and drowsiness ... Restlessness and remorse ... Doubt ... These
are the five obstacles and hindrances, parasites of the mind that weaken
wisdom.

Take a mendicant who has feeble and weak wisdom, not having given up
these five obstacles and hindrances, parasites of the mind that weaken
wisdom. It is quite impossible that they would know what's for their own
good, the good of another, or the good of both; or that they would
realize any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the
noble ones.

Suppose there was a mountain river that flowed swiftly, going far,
carrying all before it. But then a man would open channels on both
sides, so the mid-river current would be dispersed, displaced, and
separated. The river would no longer flow swiftly, going far, carrying
all before it.

In the same way, take a mendicant who has feeble and weak wisdom, not
having given up these five obstacles and hindrances, parasites of the
mind that weaken wisdom. It is not possible that they would know what's
for their own good, the good of another, or the good of both; or that
they would realize any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision
worthy of the noble ones.

Take a mendicant who has powerful wisdom, having given up these five
obstacles and hindrances, parasites of the mind that weaken wisdom. It's
quite possible that they would know what's for their own good, the good
of another, or the good of both; or that they would realize any
superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.

Suppose there was a mountain river that flowed swiftly, going far,
carrying all before it. But then a man would close up the channels on
both sides, so the mid-river current would not be dispersed, displaced,
and separated. The river would keep flowing swiftly for a long way,
carrying all before it.

In the same way, take a mendicant who has powerful wisdom, having given
up these five obstacles and hindrances, parasites of the mind that
weaken wisdom. It's quite possible that they would know what's for their
own good, the good of another, or the good of both; or that they would
realize any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the
noble ones."

### N 5.52 A Heap of the Unskillful  *Akusalarāsisutta*

"Mendicants, rightly speaking, you'd call the five hindrances a 'heap of
the unskillful'. For these five hindrances are entirely a heap of the
unskillful. What five? The hindrances of sensual desire, ill will,
dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. Rightly
speaking, you'd call these five hindrances a 'heap of the unskillful'.
For these five hindrances are entirely a heap of the unskillful."

### N 5.53 Factors That Support Meditation  *Padhāniyaṅgasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these five factors that support meditation. What
five?

It's when a mendicant has faith in the Realized One's awakening: 'That
Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in
knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for
those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.'

They are rarely ill or unwell. Their stomach digests well, being neither
too hot nor too cold, but just right, and fit for meditation.

They're not devious or deceitful. They reveal themselves honestly to the
Teacher or sensible spiritual companions.

They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and
embracing skillful qualities. They're strong, staunchly vigorous, not
slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.

They're wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is
noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.

These are the five factors that support meditation."

<!--pg-->
### N 5.54 Times Good for Meditation  *Samayasutta*

"Mendicants, there are five times that are not good for meditation. What
five?

Firstly, a mendicant is old, overcome with old age. This is the first
time that's not good for meditation.

Furthermore, a mendicant is sick, overcome by sickness. This is the
second time that's not good for meditation.

Furthermore, there's a famine, a bad harvest, so it's hard to get
almsfood, and not easy to keep going by collecting alms. This is the
third time that's not good for meditation.

Furthermore, there's peril due to turmoil in the wilds, so the
countryfolk mount their vehicles and flee everywhere. This is the fourth
time that's not good for meditation.

Furthermore, there's a schism in the Saṅgha. When the
Saṅgha is split, they abuse, insult, block, and forsake
each other. This doesn't inspire confidence in those without it, and it
causes some with confidence to change their minds. This is the fifth
time that's not good for meditation.

These are the five times that are not good for meditation.

There are five times that are good for meditation. What five?

Firstly, a mendicant is a youth, young, with pristine black hair,
blessed with youth, in the prime of life. This is the first time that's
good for meditation.

Furthermore, they are rarely ill or unwell. Their stomach digests well,
being neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and fit for
meditation. This is the second time that's good for meditation.

Furthermore, there's plenty of food, a good harvest, so it's easy to get
almsfood, and easy to keep going by collecting alms. This is the third
time that's good for meditation.

Furthermore, people live in harmony, appreciating each other, without
quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with
kindly eyes. This is the fourth time that's good for meditation.

Furthermore, the Saṅgha lives comfortably, in harmony,
appreciating each other, without quarreling, with one recitation. When
the Saṅgha is in harmony, they don't abuse, insult, block,
or forsake each other. This inspires confidence in those without it, and
increases confidence in those who have it. This is the fifth time that's
good for meditation.

These are the five times that are good for meditation."

### N 5.55 Mother and Son  *Mātāputtasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

Now, at that time a mother and son had both entered the rainy season
residence at Sāvatthī, as a monk and a nun. They wanted to
see each other often. The mother wanted to see her son often, and the
son his mother. Seeing each other often, they became close. Being so
close, they became intimate. And being intimate, lust overcame them.
With their minds swamped by lust, without resigning the training and
declaring their inability to continue, they had sex.

Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and told him what had happened.

"Mendicants, how could that futile man imagine that a mother cannot lust
for her son, or that a son cannot lust for his mother? Compared to the
sight of a woman, I do not see a single sight that is so arousing,
sensuous, intoxicating, captivating, and infatuating, and such an
obstacle to reaching the supreme sanctuary from the yoke. Sentient
beings are lustful, greedy, tied, infatuated, and attached to the sight
of a woman. They sorrow for a long time under the sway of a woman's
sight.

Compared to the sound ... smell ... taste ... touch of a woman, I do not
see a single touch that is so arousing, sensuous, intoxicating,
captivating, and infatuating, and such an obstacle to reaching the
supreme sanctuary from the yoke. Sentient beings are lustful, greedy,
tied, infatuated, and attached to the touch of a woman. They sorrow for
a long time under the sway of a woman's touch.

When a woman walks, she occupies a man's mind. When a woman stands ...
sits ... lies down ... laughs ... speaks ... sings ... cries ... is
injured, she occupies a man's mind. Even when a woman is dead, she
occupies a man's mind. For if anyone should be rightly called 'an
all-round snare of Māra', it's females.

> You might chat with someone who has knife in hand.\
> You might even chat with a goblin.\
> You might sit close by a viper,\
> whose bite would take your life.\
> But never should you chat\
> one on one with a female.
>
> They captivate the unmindful\
> with a glance and a smile.\
> Or scantily clad,\
> they speak charming words.\
> It's not good to sit with such a person,\
> even if she's injured or dead.
>
> These five kinds of sensual stimulation\
> are apparent in a woman's body:\
> sights, sounds, tastes, smells,\
> and touches so delightful.
>
> Those swept away by the flood of sensual pleasures,\
> not comprehending them,\
> are governed by transmigration---\
> time and destination, and life after life.
>
> But those who fully understand sensual pleasures\
> live fearing nothing from any quarter.\
> They are those in the world who've crossed over,\
> having reached the ending of defilements."

### N 5.56 Mentor  *Upajjhāyasutta*

Then a mendicant went up to his own mentor, and said, "Now, sir, my body
feels like it's drugged. I'm disorientated, the teachings don't spring
to mind, and dullness and drowsiness fill my mind. I lead the spiritual
life dissatisfied, and have doubts about the teachings."

Then that mendicant took his protégé to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to
one side, and said to him, "Sir, this mendicant says this: 'Now, sir, my
body feels like it's drugged. I'm disorientated, the teachings don't
spring to mind, and dullness and drowsiness fill my mind. I lead the
spiritual life dissatisfied, and have doubts about the teachings.'"

"That's how it is, mendicant, when your sense doors are unguarded, you
eat too much, you're not dedicated to wakefulness, you're unable to
discern skillful qualities, and you don't pursue the development of the
qualities that lead to awakening in the evening and toward dawn. Your
body feels like it's drugged. You're disorientated, the teachings don't
spring to mind, and dullness and drowsiness fill your mind. You lead the
spiritual life dissatisfied, and have doubts about the teachings.

So you should train like this: 'I will guard my sense doors, eat in
moderation, be dedicated to wakefulness, discern skillful qualities, and
pursue the development of the qualities that lead to awakening in the
evening and toward dawn.' That's how you should train."

When that mendicant had been given this advice by the Buddha, he got up
from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him
on his right, before leaving.

Then that mendicant, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and
resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in
this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal
for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.

He understood: "Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been
completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further
for this place." And that mendicant became one of the perfected.

When that mendicant had attained perfection, he went up to his own
mentor, and said, "Now, sir, my body doesn't feel like it's drugged. I'm
not disorientated, the teachings spring to mind, and dullness and
drowsiness don't fill my mind. I lead the spiritual life satisfied, and
have no doubts about the teachings."

Then that mendicant took his protégé to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to
one side, and said to him, "Sir, this mendicant says this: 'Now, sir, my
body doesn't feel like it's drugged. I'm not disorientated, the
teachings spring to mind, and dullness and drowsiness don't fill my
mind. I lead the spiritual life satisfied, and have no doubts about the
teachings.'"

"That's how it is, mendicant, when your sense doors are guarded, you're
moderate in eating, you're dedicated to wakefulness, you're able to
discern skillful qualities, and you pursue the development of the
qualities that lead to awakening in the evening and toward dawn. Your
body doesn't feel like it's drugged. You're not disorientated, the
teachings spring to mind, and dullness and drowsiness don't fill your
mind. You lead the spiritual life satisfied, and have no doubts about
the teachings.

So you should train like this: 'We will guard our sense doors, eat in
moderation, be dedicated to wakefulness, discern skillful qualities, and
pursue the development of the qualities that lead to awakening in the
evening and toward dawn.' That's how you should train."

### N 5.57 Subjects for Regular Reviewing  *Abhiṇhapaccavekkhitabbaṭhānasutta*

"Mendicants, a woman or a man, a layperson or a renunciate should often
review these five subjects. What five?

'I am liable to grow old, I am not exempt from old age.' A woman or a
man, a layperson or a renunciate should often review this.

'I am liable to get sick, I am not exempt from sickness.' ...

'I am liable to die, I am not exempt from death.' ...

'I must be parted and separated from all I hold dear and beloved.' ...

'I am the owner of my deeds and heir to my deeds. Deeds are my womb, my
relative, and my refuge.

I shall be the heir of whatever deeds I do, whether good or bad.' A
woman or a man, a layperson or a renunciate should often review this.

What is the advantage for a woman or a man, a layperson or a renunciate
of often reviewing this: 'I am liable to grow old, I am not exempt from
old age'? There are sentient beings who, intoxicated with the vanity of
youth, do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. Reviewing this
subject often, they entirely give up the vanity of youth, or at least
reduce it. This is the advantage for a woman or a man, a layperson or a
renunciate of often reviewing this: 'I am liable to grow old, I am not
exempt from old age'.

What is the advantage of often reviewing this: 'I am liable to get sick,
I am not exempt from sickness'? There are sentient beings who, drunk on
the vanity of health, do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.

separated from all I hold dear and beloved'? There are sentient beings
who, aroused by desire and lust for their dear and beloved, do bad
things by way of body, speech, and mind. Reviewing this subject often,
they entirely give up desire and lust for their dear and beloved, or at
least reduce it. This is the advantage of often reviewing this: 'I must
be parted and separated from all I hold dear and beloved'.

relative, and my refuge. I shall be the heir of whatever deeds I do,
whether good or bad.'

Then that noble disciple reflects: 'It's not just me who is liable to
grow old, not being exempt from old age. For all sentient beings grow
old according to their nature, as long as they come and go, pass away
and are reborn.' When they review this subject often, the path is born
in them. They cultivate, develop, and make much of it. By doing so, they
give up the fetters and eliminate the underlying tendencies.

### N 5.58 The Licchavi Youths  *Licchavikumārakasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the
Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe,
entered Vesālī for alms. Then after the meal, on his return
from almsround, he plunged deep into the Great Wood and sat at the root
of a tree for the day's meditation.

Now at that time several Licchavi youths took strung bows and, escorted
by a pack of hounds, were going for a walk in the Great Wood when they
saw the Buddha seated at the root of a tree. When they saw him, they put
down their strung bows, tied their hounds up to one side, and went up to
him. They bowed and silently paid homage to the Buddha with joined
palms.

Now at that time Mahānāma the Licchavi was going for a walk
in the Great Wood when he saw those Licchavi youths silently paying
homage to the Buddha with joined palms. Seeing this, he went up to the
Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and expressed this heartfelt
sentiment, "They will become Vajjis! They will become Vajjis!"

"But Mahānāma, why do you say that they will become
Vajjis?"

"Sir, these Licchavi youths are violent, harsh, and brash. Whenever
sweets are left out for families---sugar-cane, jujube fruits, pancakes,
pies, or fritters---they filch them and eat them up. And they hit women
and girls of good families on their backs. But now they're silently
paying homage to the Buddha with joined palms."

"Mahānāma, you can expect only growth, not decline, when
you find five qualities in any gentleman---whether he's an anointed
aristocratic king, an appointed or hereditary official, an army general,
a village chief, a guild chief, or a ruler of his own clan.

What five?

Firstly, a gentleman uses his legitimate wealth---earned by his efforts
and initiative, built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of
the brow---to honor, respect, esteem, and venerate his mother and
father. Honored in this way, his mother and father love him with a good
heart, wishing: 'Live long! Stay alive for a long time!' When a
gentleman is loved by his mother and father, you can expect only growth,
not decline.

Furthermore, a gentleman uses his legitimate wealth to honor, respect,
esteem, and venerate his wives and children, bondservants, workers, and
staff. Honored in this way, his wives and children, bondservants,
workers, and staff love him with a good heart, wishing: 'Live long! Stay
alive for a long time!' When a gentleman is loved by his wives and
children, bondservants, workers, and staff, you can expect only growth,
not decline.

Furthermore, a gentleman uses his legitimate wealth to honor, respect,
esteem, and venerate those who work the neighboring fields, and those he
does business with. Honored in this way, those who work the neighboring
fields, and those he does business with love him with a good heart,
wishing: 'Live long! Stay alive for a long time!' When a gentleman is
loved by those who work the neighboring fields, and those he does
business with, you can expect only growth, not decline.

Furthermore, a gentleman uses his legitimate wealth to honor, respect,
esteem, and venerate the deities who receive spirit-offerings. Honored
in this way, the deities who receive spirit-offerings love him with a
good heart, wishing: 'Live long! Stay alive for a long time!' When a
gentleman is loved by the deities, you can expect only growth, not
decline.

Furthermore, a gentleman uses his legitimate wealth to honor, respect,
esteem, and venerate ascetics and brahmins. Honored in this way,
ascetics and brahmins love him with a good heart, wishing: 'Live long!
Stay alive for a long time!' When a gentleman is loved by ascetics and
brahmins, you can expect only growth, not decline.

You can expect only growth, not decline, when you find these five
qualities in any gentleman---whether he's an anointed aristocratic king,
an appointed or hereditary official, an army general, a village chief, a
guild chief, or a ruler of his own clan.

> He's always dutiful to his mother and father,\
> and for the good of his wives and children.\
> He looks after those in his household,\
> and those dependent on him for their livelihood.
>
> A kind and ethical person\
> looks after the welfare of relatives---\
> both those who have passed away,\
> and those alive at present.
>
> While living at home, an astute person\
> uses legitimate means to give rise to joy\
> for ascetics, brahmins,\
> and also the gods.
>
> Having done good,\
> he's venerable and praiseworthy.\
> They praise him in this life,\
> and he departs to rejoice in heaven."

### N 5.59 Gone Forth When Old (1st)  *Paṭhamavuḍḍhapabbajitasutta*

"Mendicants, it's hard to find someone gone forth when old who has five
qualities. What five? It's hard to find someone gone forth when old who
is sophisticated, well-presented, and learned, who can teach Dhamma, and
has memorized the monastic law. It's hard to find someone gone forth
when old who has these five qualities."

### N 5.60 Gone Forth When Old (2nd)  *Dutiyavuḍḍhapabbajitasutta*

"Mendicants, it's hard to find someone gone forth when old who has five
qualities. What five? It's hard to find someone gone forth when old who
is easy to admonish, retains what they learn, and learns respectfully,
who can teach the Dhamma, and has memorized the monastic law. It's hard
to find someone gone forth when old who has these five qualities."
