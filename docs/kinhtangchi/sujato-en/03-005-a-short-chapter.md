### AN 3.42 Three Grounds  *Tiṭhānasutta*

"There are three grounds, mendicants, by which a person with faith and
confidence can be known. What three? They like to see ethical people.

stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go,
committed to charity, loving to give and to share. These are the three
grounds by which a person with faith and confidence can be known.

> They like to see ethical people;\
> they want to hear the true teaching;\
> they've driven out the stain of stinginess:\
> that's who's called a person of faith."

### AN 3.47 Characteristics of the Conditioned  *Saṅkhatalakkhaṇasutta*

### AN 3.48 The King of Mountains  *Pabbatarājasutta*

"Mendicants, great sal trees grow in three ways supported by the
Himalayas, the king of mountains. What three? The branches, leaves, and
foliage; the bark and shoots; and the softwood and heartwood. Great sal
trees grow in these three ways supported by the Himalayas, the king of
mountains.

In the same way, a family grows in three ways supported by a family head
with faith. What three? Faith, ethics, and wisdom. A family grows in
these three ways supported by a family head with faith.

> Supported by the rocky mountain\
> in the wilds, the formidable forest,\
> the tree grows\
> to become lord of the forest.
>
> So too, when the family head\
> is ethical and faithful,\
> supported by them, they grow:\
> children, partners, and kin,\
> colleagues, relatives,\
> and those dependent for their livelihood.
>
> Seeing the ethical conduct of the virtuous,\
> the generosity and good deeds,\
> those who see clearly\
> do likewise.
>
> Having practiced the teaching here,\
> the path that goes to a good place,\
> they delight in the heavenly realm,\
> enjoying all the pleasures they desire."

### AN 3.49 Keen  *Ātappakaraṇīyasutta*

"In three situations, mendicants, you should be keen. What three? You
should be keen to prevent bad, unskillful qualities from arising. You
should be keen to give rise to skillful qualities. And you should be
keen to endure physical pain---sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant,
disagreeable, life-threatening. In these three situations, you should be
keen.

It's a mendicant who is keen to prevent bad, unskillful qualities from
arising. They're keen to give rise to skillful qualities. And they're
keen to endure physical pain---sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant,
disagreeable, life-threatening. This is called a mendicant who is keen,
alert, and mindful so as to rightly make an end of suffering."

### AN 3.50 A Master Thief  *Mahācorasutta*

"Mendicants, a master thief with three factors breaks into houses,
plunders wealth, steals from isolated buildings, and commits highway
robbery. What three?

A master thief relies on uneven ground, on thick cover, and on powerful
individuals. And how does a master thief rely on uneven ground? It's
when a master thief relies on inaccessible riverlands or rugged
mountains. That's how a master thief relies on uneven ground.

And how does a master thief rely on thick cover? It's when a master
thief relies on thick grass, thick trees, a blind spot, or a large
forest grove. That's how a master thief relies on thick cover.

And how does a master thief rely on powerful individuals? It's when a
master thief relies on rulers or their chief ministers. They think: 'If
anyone accuses me of anything, these rulers or their chief ministers
will speak in my defense in the case.' And that's exactly what happens.
That's how a master thief relies on powerful individuals.

A master thief with these three factors breaks into houses, plunders
wealth, steals from isolated buildings, and commits highway robbery.

In the same way, when a bad mendicant has three factors, they keep
themselves broken and damaged. They deserve to be blamed and criticized
by sensible people, and they create much wickedness. What three?

A bad mendicant relies on uneven ground, on thick cover, and on powerful
individuals.

And how does a bad mendicant rely on uneven ground? It's when a bad
mendicant has unethical conduct by way of body, speech, and mind. That's
how a bad mendicant relies on uneven ground.

And how does a bad mendicant rely on thick cover? It's when a bad
mendicant has wrong view, he's attached to an extremist view. That's how
a bad mendicant relies on thick cover.

And how does a bad mendicant rely on powerful individuals? It's when a
bad mendicant relies on rulers or their chief ministers. They think: 'If
anyone accuses me of anything, these rulers or their chief ministers
will speak in my defense in the case.' And that's exactly what happens.
That's how a bad mendicant relies on powerful individuals.

When a bad mendicant has these three qualities, they keep themselves
broken and damaged. They deserve to be blamed and criticized by sensible
people, and they create much wickedness."
