# The Chapter on Deities

### N 6.31 A Trainee  *Sekhasutta*

"These six things lead to the decline of a mendicant trainee. What six?
They relish work, talk, sleep, and company. They don't guard the sense
doors, and they eat too much. These six things lead to the decline of a
mendicant trainee.

These six things don't lead to the decline of a mendicant trainee. What
six? They don't relish work, talk, sleep, and company. They guard the
sense doors, and they don't eat too much. These six things don't lead to
the decline of a mendicant trainee."

### N 6.32 Non-decline (1st)  *Paṭhamaaparihānasutta*

Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta's
Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, these six things don't lead to the decline of a mendicant. What
six? Respect for the Teacher, for the teaching, for the
Saṅgha, for the training, for diligence, and for
hospitality. These six things don't lead to the decline of a mendicant."

That's what that deity said, and the teacher approved. Then that deity,
knowing that the teacher approved, bowed, and respectfully circled the
Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.

Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that
had happened, adding:

> "Respect for the Teacher and the teaching,\
> and keen respect for the Saṅgha;\
> a mendicant who respects diligence\
> and hospitality\
> can't decline,\
> and has drawn near to extinguishment."

<!--pg-->
### N 6.33 Non-decline (2nd)  *Dutiyaaparihānasutta*

"Tonight, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta's Grove, came to
me, bowed, stood to one side, and said to me: 'Sir, these six things
don't lead to the decline of a mendicant. What six? Respect for the
Teacher, for the teaching, for the Saṅgha, for the
training, for conscience, and for prudence. These six things don't lead
to the decline of a mendicant.'

That is what that deity said. Then he bowed and respectfully circled me,
keeping me on his right side, before vanishing right there.

> One respectful of the Teacher and the teaching,\
> keenly respecting the Saṅgha;\
> endowed with conscience and prudence,\
> reverential and respectful---\
> it is impossible for them to decline;\
> they have drawn near to extinguishment."

### N 6.34 With Mahāmoggallāna  *Mahāmoggallānasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

Then as Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was in private retreat
this thought came to his mind, "Which gods know that they are
stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for
awakening?"

Now, at that time a monk called Tissa had recently passed away and been
reborn in a realm of divinity. There they knew that The divinity Tissa
was very mighty and powerful.

And then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, as easily as a strong
person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from Jeta's Grove
and reappeared in that realm of divinity.

Tissa saw Moggallāna coming off in the distance, and said
to him, "Come, my good Moggallāna! Welcome, my good
Moggallāna! It's been a long time since you took the
opportunity to come here. Sit, my good Moggallāna, this
seat is for you." Moggallāna sat down on the seat spread
out. Then Tissa bowed to Moggallāna and sat to one side.

Moggallāna said to him, "Tissa, which gods know that they
are stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound
for awakening?"

"The gods of the four great kings know this."

"But do all of them know this?"

"No, my good Moggallāna, not all of them. Those who lack
experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the
Saṅgha, and lack the ethics loved by the noble ones, do not
know that they are stream-enterers. But those who have experiential
confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and
have the ethics loved by the noble ones, do know that they are
stream-enterers."

"But Tissa, is it only the gods of the four great kings who know that
they are stream-enterers, or do the gods of the thirty-three ... the
gods of Yama ... the joyful gods ... the gods who love to imagine ...
and the gods who control what is imagined by others know that they are
stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for
awakening?"

"The gods of these various classes know this."

"But do all of them know this?"

"No, my good Moggallāna, not all of them. Those who lack
experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the
Saṅgha, and lack the ethics loved by the noble ones, do not
know that they are stream-enterers. But those who have experiential
confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and
have the ethics loved by the noble ones, do know that they are
stream-enterers."

Moggallāna approved and agreed with what the divinity Tissa
said. Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their
arm, he vanished from that realm of divinity and reappeared in Jeta's
Grove.

### N 6.35 Things That Play a Part in Realization  *Vijjābhāgiyasutta*

"These six things play a part in realization. What six? The perception
of impermanence, the perception of suffering in impermanence, the
perception of not-self in suffering, the perception of giving up, the
perception of fading away, and the perception of cessation. These are
the six things that play a part in realization."

<!--pg-->
### N 6.36 Roots of Arguments  *Vivādamūlasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these six roots of arguments. What six? Firstly,
a mendicant is irritable and acrimonious. Such a mendicant lacks respect
and reverence for the Teacher, the teaching, and the
Saṅgha, and they don't fulfill the training. They create a
dispute in the Saṅgha, which is for the detriment and
suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm, detriment,
and suffering of gods and humans. If you see such a root of arguments in
yourselves or others, you should try to give up this bad thing. If you
don't see it, you should practice so that it doesn't come up in the
future. That's how to give up this bad root of arguments, so it doesn't
come up in the future.

Furthermore, a mendicant is offensive and contemptuous ... They're
jealous and stingy ... devious and deceitful ... with corrupt wishes and
wrong view ... They're attached to their own views, holding them tight,
and refusing to let go. Such a mendicant lacks respect and reverence for
the Teacher, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and they don't
fulfill the training. They create a dispute in the Saṅgha,
which is for the detriment and unhappiness of the people, against the
people, for the harm, detriment, and suffering of gods and humans. If
you see such a root of arguments in yourselves or others, you should try
to give up this bad thing. If you don't see it, you should practice so
that it doesn't come up in the future. That's how to give up this bad
root of arguments, so it doesn't come up in the future. These are the
six roots of arguments."

### N 6.37 A Gift With Six Factors  *Chaḷaṅgadānasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

Now at that time Veḷukaṇṭakī, Nanda's mother, was preparing
a religious donation with six factors for the mendicant
Saṅgha headed by Sāriputta and
Moggallāna. The Buddha saw her doing this, with his
clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, and he addressed the
mendicants:

"This Veḷukaṇṭakī, Nanda's mother, is preparing a religious
donation with six factors for the mendicant Saṅgha headed
by Sāriputta and Moggallāna.

And how does a religious donation have six factors? Three factors apply
to the donor and three to the recipients.

What three factors apply to the donor? It's when a donor is in a good
mood before giving, while giving they feel confident, and after giving
they're uplifted. These three factors apply to the donor.

What three factors apply to the recipients? It's when the recipients are
free of greed, hate, and delusion, or practicing to be free of them.
These three factors apply to the recipients.

Thus three factors apply to the donor and three to the recipients.
That's how a religious donation has six factors.

It's not easy to grasp the merit of such a six-factored donation by
saying that this is the extent of their overflowing merit, overflowing
goodness that nurtures happiness and is conducive to heaven, ripening in
happiness and leading to heaven. And it leads to what is likable,
desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness. It's simply reckoned as
an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit.

It's like trying to grasp how much water is in the ocean. It's not easy
to say how many gallons, how many hundreds, thousands, hundreds of
thousands of gallons there are. It's simply reckoned as an incalculable,
immeasurable, great mass of water. In the same way, it's not easy to
grasp the merit of such a six-factored donation ...

> A good mood before giving,\
> confidence while giving,\
> feeling uplifted after giving:\
> this is the perfect sacrifice.
>
> Free of greed, free of hate,\
> free of delusion, undefiled;\
> this is the field for the perfect sacrifice,\
> the disciplined spiritual practitioners.
>
> After rinsing,\
> you give with your own hands.\
> This sacrifice is very fruitful\
> for both yourself and others.
>
> When an intelligent, faithful person,\
> sacrifices like this, with a mind of letting go,\
> that astute one is reborn\
> in a happy, pleasing world."

### N 6.38 One's Own Volition  *Attakārīsutta*

Then a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings
with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat
down to one side and said to the Buddha:

"Mister Gotama, this is my doctrine and view: One does not act of one's
own volition, nor does one act of another's volition."

"Brahmin, may I never see or hear of anyone holding such a doctrine or
view! How on earth can someone who comes and goes on his own say that
one does not act of one's own volition, nor does one act of another's
volition?

What do you think, brahmin, is there an element of initiative?"

"Yes, sir."

"Since this is so, do we find sentient beings who initiate activity?"

"Yes, sir."

"Since there is an element of initiative, and sentient beings who
initiate activity are found, sentient beings act of their own volition
or that of another.

What do you think, brahmin, is there an element of persistence ...
exertion ... strength ... endurance ... energy?"

"Yes, sir."

"Since this is so, do we find sentient beings who have energy?"

"Yes, sir."

"Since there is an element of energy, and sentient beings who have
energy are found, sentient beings act of their own volition or that of
another.

Brahmin, may I never see or hear of anyone holding such a doctrine or
view! How on earth can someone who comes and goes on his own say that
one does not act of one's own volition, nor does one act of another's
volition?"

"Excellent, Mister Gotama! Excellent! ... From this day forth, may
Mister Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for
life."

### N 6.39 Sources  *Nidānasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these three sources that give rise to deeds. What
three? Greed, hate, and delusion are sources that give rise to deeds.
Greed doesn't give rise to contentment. Rather, greed just gives rise to
greed. Hate doesn't give rise to love. Rather, hate just gives rise to
hate. Delusion doesn't give rise to understanding. Rather, delusion just
gives rise to delusion. It's not because of deeds born of greed, hate,
and delusion that gods, humans, or those in any other good places are
found. Rather, it's because of deeds born of greed, hate, and delusion
that hell, the animal realm, the ghost realm, or any other bad places
are found. These are three sources that give rise to deeds.

Mendicants, there are these three sources that give rise to deeds. What

### N 6.40 With Kimbila  *Kimilasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Kimbilā in the Freshwater Mangrove Wood. Then Venerable
Kimbila went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to
him:

"What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why the true teaching does
not last long after the final quenching of the Realized One?"

"Kimbila, it's when the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen lack respect
and reverence for the Teacher, the teaching, the Saṅgha,
the training, diligence, and hospitality after the final quenching of
the Realized One. This is the cause, this is the reason why the true
teaching does not last long after the final quenching of the Realized
One."

"What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why the true teaching does
last long after the final quenching of the Realized One?"

"Kimbila, it's when the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen maintain
respect and reverence for the Teacher, the teaching, the
Saṅgha, the training, diligence, and hospitality after the
final quenching of the Realized One. This is the cause, this is the
reason why the true teaching does last long after the final quenching of
the Realized One."

### N 6.41 A Tree Trunk  *Dārukkhandhasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time Venerable
Sāriputta was staying near Rājagaha, on the
Vulture's Peak Mountain.

Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and,
taking his bowl and robe, descended the Vulture's Peak together with
several mendicants. At a certain spot he saw a large tree trunk, and he
addressed the mendicants, "Reverends, do you see this large tree trunk?"

"Yes, reverend."

"If they wanted to, a mendicant with psychic powers who has mastered
their mind could determine this tree trunk to be nothing but earth. Why
is that? Because the earth element exists in the tree trunk. Relying on
that a mendicant with psychic powers could determine it to be nothing
but earth. If they wanted to, a mendicant with psychic powers who has
mastered their mind could determine this tree trunk to be nothing but
water. ... Or they could determine it to be nothing but fire ... Or they
could determine it to be nothing but air ... Or they could determine it
to be nothing but beautiful ... Or they could determine it to be nothing
but ugly. Why is that? Because the element of ugliness exists in the
tree trunk. Relying on that a mendicant with psychic powers could
determine it to be nothing but ugly."

<!--pg-->
### N 6.42 With Nāgita  *Nāgitasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was wandering in
the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of
mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named
Icchānaṅgala. He stayed in a forest near
Icchānaṅgala. The brahmins and householders of
Icchānaṅgala heard:

"It seems the ascetic Gotama---a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan
family---has arrived at Icchānaṅgala. He is staying in a
forest near Icchānaṅgala. He has this good reputation:
'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in
knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for
those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.'
He has realized with his own insight this world---with its gods,
Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics
and brahmins, gods and humans---and he makes it known to others. He
proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle,
and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased; and he explains a
spiritual practice that's entirely full and pure. It's good to see such
perfected ones." Then, when the night had passed, they took many fresh
and cooked foods and went to the forest near Icchānaṅgala,
where they stood outside the gates making a dreadful racket.

Now, at that time Venerable Nāgita was the Buddha's
attendant. Then the Buddha said to Nāgita,
"Nāgita, who's making that dreadful racket? You'd think it
was fishermen hauling in a catch!"

"Sir, it's these brahmins and householders of Icchānaṅgala.
They've brought many fresh and cooked foods, and they're standing
outside the gates wanting to offer it specially to the Buddha and the
mendicant Saṅgha."

"Nāgita, may I never become famous. May fame not come to
me. There are those who can't get the pleasure of renunciation, the
pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the pleasure of awakening
when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can. Let them enjoy
the filthy, lazy pleasure of possessions, honor, and popularity."

"Sir, may the Blessed One please relent now! May the Holy One relent!
Now is the time for the Buddha to relent. Wherever the Buddha now goes,
the brahmins and householders, and people of town and country will
incline the same way. It's like when the heavens rain heavily and the
water flows downhill. In the same way, wherever the Buddha now goes, the
brahmins and householders, and people of town and country will incline
the same way. Why is that? Because of the Buddha's ethics and wisdom."

"Nāgita, may I never become famous. May fame not come to
me. There are those who can't get the pleasure of renunciation, the
pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the pleasure of awakening
when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can. Let them enjoy
the filthy, lazy pleasure of possessions, honor, and popularity.

Take a mendicant living within a village who I see sitting immersed in
samādhi. I think to myself: 'Now a monastery worker, a
novice, or a fellow practitioner will make this venerable fall from
immersion.' So I'm not pleased that that mendicant is living within a
village.

Take a mendicant in the wilderness who I see sitting nodding in
meditation. I think to myself: 'Now this venerable, having dispelled
that sleepiness and weariness, will focus just on the unified perception
of wilderness.' So I'm pleased that that mendicant is living in the
wilderness.

Take a mendicant in the wilderness who I see sitting without being
immersed in samādhi. I think to myself: 'Now if this
venerable's mind is not immersed in samādhi they will
immerse it, or if it is immersed in samādhi, they will
preserve it.' So I'm pleased that that mendicant is living in the
wilderness.

Take a mendicant in the wilderness who I see sitting immersed in
samādhi. I think to myself: 'Now this venerable will free
the unfreed mind or preserve the freed mind.' So I'm pleased that that
mendicant is living in the wilderness.

Take a mendicant who I see living within a village receiving robes,
almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. Enjoying
possessions, honor, and popularity they neglect retreat, and they
neglect remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. They come down
to villages, towns, and capital cities and make their home there. So I'm
not pleased that that mendicant is living within a village.

Take a mendicant who I see in the wilderness receiving robes, almsfood,
lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. Fending off
possessions, honor, and popularity they don't neglect retreat, and they
don't neglect remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. So I'm
pleased that that mendicant is living in the wilderness.

Nāgita, when I'm walking along a road and I don't see
anyone ahead or behind I feel relaxed, even if I need to urinate or
defecate."
