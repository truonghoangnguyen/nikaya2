# The Chapter on Giving

### AN 8.31 Giving (1st)  *Paṭhamadānasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these eight gifts. What eight? A person might
give a gift after insulting the recipient. Or they give out of fear. Or
they give thinking, 'They gave to me.' Or they give thinking, 'They'll
give to me.' Or they give thinking, 'It's good to give.' Or they give
thinking, 'I cook, they don't. It wouldn't be right for me to not give
to them.' Or they give thinking, 'By giving this gift I'll get a good
reputation.' Or they give thinking, 'This is an adornment and requisite
for the mind.' These are the eight gifts."

### AN 8.32 Giving (2nd)  *Dutiyadānasutta*

> "Faith, conscience, and skillful giving\
> are qualities true persons follow.\
> For this, they say, is the path of the gods,\
> which leads to the heavenly realm."

<!--pg-->
### AN 8.33 Reasons to Give  *Dānavatthusutta*

"Mendicants, there are these eight grounds for giving. What eight? A
person might give a gift out of favoritism or hostility or stupidity or
cowardice. Or they give thinking, 'Giving was practiced by my father and
my father's father. It would not be right for me to abandon this family
tradition.' Or they give thinking, 'After I've given this gift, when my
body breaks up, after death, I'll be reborn in a good place, a heavenly
realm.' Or they give thinking, 'When giving this gift my mind becomes
clear, and I become happy and joyful.' Or they give a gift thinking,
'This is an adornment and requisite for the mind.' These are the eight
grounds for giving."

### AN 8.34 A Field  *Khettasutta*

"Mendicants, when a field has eight factors a seed sown in it is not
very fruitful or rewarding or productive. What eight factors does it
have? It's when a field has mounds and ditches. It has stones and
gravel. It's salty. It doesn't have deep furrows. And it's not equipped
with water inlets, water outlets, irrigation channels, and boundaries.
When a field has these eight factors a seed sown in it is not fruitful
or rewarding or productive.

In the same way, when an ascetic or brahmin has eight factors a gift
given to them is not very fruitful or beneficial or splendid or
bountiful. What eight factors do they have? It's when an ascetic or
brahmin has wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong
livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong immersion. When
an ascetic or brahmin has these eight factors a gift given to them is
not very fruitful or beneficial or splendid or bountiful.

>
> So too, when you give excellent food\

> it leads to many excellences,\
> for what you did was excellent.

> So if a person wants excellence,\

> this is complete excellence."

### AN 8.35 Rebirth by Giving  *Dānūpapattisutta*

"Mendicants, there are these eight rebirths by giving. What eight?

First, someone gives to ascetics or brahmins such things as food, drink,
clothing, vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and
lighting. Whatever they give they expect back. They see a well-to-do
aristocrat or brahmin or householder amusing themselves, supplied and
provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. It occurs to them:
'If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the
company of well-to-do aristocrats or brahmins or householders!' They
settle on that thought, stabilize it, and develop it. As they've settled
for less and not developed further, their thought leads to rebirth
there. When their body breaks up, after death, they're reborn in the
company of well-to-do aristocrats or brahmins or householders. But I say
that this is only for those of ethical conduct, not for the unethical.
The heart's wish of an ethical person succeeds because of their purity.

Next, someone gives to ascetics or brahmins ... Whatever they give they
expect back. And they've heard: 'The gods of the four great kings are
long-lived, beautiful, and very happy.' It occurs to them: 'If only,
when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of
the gods of the four great kings!' ... When their body breaks up, after
death, they're reborn in the company of the gods of the four great
kings. But I say that this is only for those of ethical conduct, not for
the unethical. The heart's wish of an ethical person succeeds because of
their purity.

Next, someone gives to ascetics or brahmins ... Whatever they give they
expect back. And they've heard: 'The gods of the thirty-three ...'

'The gods of Yama ...'

'The joyful gods ...'

'The gods who love to imagine ...'

'The gods who control what is imagined by others are long-lived,
beautiful, and very happy.' It occurs to them: 'If only, when my body
breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of the gods who
control what is imagined by others!' They settle on that thought,
stabilize it, and develop it. As they've settled for less and not
developed further, their thought leads to rebirth there. When their body
breaks up, after death, they're reborn in the company of the gods who
control what is imagined by others. But I say that this is only for
those of ethical conduct, not for the unethical. The heart's wish of an
ethical person succeeds because of their purity.

Next, someone gives to ascetics or brahmins such things as food, drink,
clothing, vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and
lighting. Whatever they give they expect back. And they've heard: 'The
gods of the Divinity's host are long-lived, beautiful, and very happy.'
It occurs to them: 'If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I
would be reborn in the company of the gods of the Divinity's host!' They
settle on that thought, stabilize it, and develop it. As they've settled
for less and not developed further, their thought leads to rebirth
there. When their body breaks up, after death, they're reborn in the
company of the gods of the Divinity's host. But I say that this is only
for those of ethical conduct, not for the unethical. And for those free
of desire, not those with desire. The heart's wish of an ethical person
succeeds because of their freedom from desire.

These are the eight rebirths by giving."

These are the three grounds for making merit."

### AN 8.37 Gifts of a True Person  *Sappurisadānasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these eight gifts of a true person. What eight?
Their gift is pure, good quality, timely, appropriate, intelligent, and
regular. While giving their heart is confident, and afterwards they're
uplifted. These are the eight gifts of a true person.

<!--pg-->
### AN 8.38 A True Person  *Sappurisasutta*

"Mendicants, a true person is born in a family for the benefit, welfare,
and happiness of the people. For the benefit, welfare, and happiness of
mother and father; children and partners; bondservants, workers, and
staff; friends and colleagues; departed ancestors; the king; the
deities; and ascetics and brahmins.

It's like a great rain cloud, which nourishes all the crops for the
benefit, welfare, and happiness of the people. In the same way, a true
person is born in a family for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of
the people. ...

> A wise person living at home\

### AN 8.39 Overflowing Merit  *Abhisandasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these eight kinds of overflowing merit,
overflowing goodness. They nurture happiness and are conducive to
heaven, ripening in happiness and leading to heaven. They lead to what
is likable, desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness. What eight?

Firstly, a noble disciple has gone for refuge to the Buddha. This is the
first kind of overflowing merit ...

Furthermore, a noble disciple has gone for refuge to the teaching. This
is the second kind of overflowing merit ...

Furthermore, a noble disciple has gone for refuge to the
Saṅgha. This is the third kind of overflowing merit ...

Mendicants, these five gifts are great, primordial, long-standing,
traditional, and ancient. They are uncorrupted, as they have been since
the beginning. They're not being corrupted now nor will they be.
Sensible ascetics and brahmins don't look down on them. What five?

Firstly, a noble disciple gives up killing living creatures. By so doing
they give to countless sentient beings the gift of freedom from fear,
enmity, and ill will. And they themselves also enjoy unlimited freedom
from fear, enmity, and ill will. This is the first gift that is a great
offering, primordial, long-standing, traditional, and ancient. It is
uncorrupted, as it has been since the beginning. It's not being
corrupted now nor will it be. Sensible ascetics and brahmins don't look
down on it. This is the fourth kind of overflowing merit ...

Furthermore, a noble disciple gives up stealing. ... This is the fifth
kind of overflowing merit ...

Furthermore, a noble disciple gives up sexual misconduct. ... This is
the sixth kind of overflowing merit ...

Furthermore, a noble disciple gives up lying. ... This is the seventh
kind of overflowing merit ...

Furthermore, a noble disciple gives up beer, wine, and liquor
intoxicants. By so doing they give to countless sentient beings the gift
of freedom from fear, enmity, and ill will. And they themselves also
enjoy unlimited freedom from fear, enmity, and ill will. This is the
fifth gift that is a great offering, primordial, long-standing,
traditional, and ancient. It is uncorrupted, as it has been since the
beginning. It's not being corrupted now nor will it be. Sensible
ascetics and brahmins don't look down on it. This is the eighth kind of
overflowing merit ...

These are the eight kinds of overflowing merit, overflowing goodness.
They nurture happiness and are conducive to heaven, ripening in
happiness and leading to heaven. They lead to what is likable,
desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness."
