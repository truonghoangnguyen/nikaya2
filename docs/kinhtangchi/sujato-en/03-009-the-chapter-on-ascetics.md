## The Chapter on Ascetics

### N 3.81 Ascetics  *Samaṇasutta*

"Mendicants, there are three duties of an ascetic. What three?
Undertaking the training in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the
higher wisdom. These are the three duties of an ascetic.

So you should train like this: 'We will have keen enthusiasm for
undertaking the training in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the
higher wisdom.' That's how you should train."

### N 3.82 The Donkey  *Gadrabhasutta*

"Suppose, mendicants, a donkey followed behind a herd of cattle,
thinking: 'I can moo too! I can moo too!' But it doesn't look like a
cow, or sound like a cow, or leave a footprint like a cow. Still it
follows behind a herd of cattle, thinking: 'I can moo too! I can moo
too!'

In the same way, some mendicant follows behind the mendicant
[Saṅgha]{lang="sa"}, thinking: 'I'm a monk too! I'm a monk too!' But
they don't have the same enthusiasm for undertaking the training in the
higher ethics, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom as the other
mendicants. Still they follow behind the mendicant [Saṇgha]{lang="sa"},
thinking: 'I'm a monk too! I'm a monk too!'

So you should train like this: 'We will have keen enthusiasm for
undertaking the training in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the
higher wisdom.' That's how you should train."

### N 3.83 Fields  *Khettasutta*

"Mendicants, a farmer has three primary duties. What three? A farmer
first of all makes sure the field is well ploughed and tilled. Next they
plant seeds in season. When the time is right, they irrigate the field
and then drain it. These are the three primary duties of a farmer.

In the same way, a mendicant has three primary duties. What three?
Undertaking the training in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the
higher wisdom. These are the three primary duties of a mendicant.

So you should train like this: 'We will have keen enthusiasm for
undertaking the training in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the
higher wisdom.' That's how you should train."

### N 3.84 The Vajji  *Vajjiputtasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near [Vesālī]{lang="sa"}, at the
Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then a certain Vajji monk
went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, each fortnight over a hundred and fifty training rules are
recited. I'm not able to train in them."

"But monk, are you able to train in three trainings: the higher ethics,
the higher mind, and the higher wisdom?"

"I am, sir."

"So, monk, you should train in these three trainings: the higher ethics,
the higher mind, and the higher wisdom.

As you train in these, you will give up greed, hate, and delusion. Then
you won't do anything unskillful, or practice anything bad."

After some time that monk trained in the higher ethics, the higher mind,
and the higher wisdom. He gave up greed, hate, and delusion. Then he
didn't do anything unskillful, or practice anything bad.

### N 3.85 A Trainee  *Sekkhasutta*

Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and
said to him:

"Sir, they speak of this person called 'a trainee'. How is a trainee
defined?"

"They train, mendicant, that's why they're called 'a trainee'. What is
their training? They train in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and
the higher wisdom. They train, that's why they're called 'a trainee'.

> As a trainee trains,\
> following the straight road,\
> first they know about ending;\
> enlightenment follows in the same lifetime.
>
> Then the knowledge comes\
> such a one, freed through enlightenment,\
> with the end of the fetters of continued existence:\
> 'My freedom is unshakable.'"

### N 3.86 Training (1st)  *Paṭhamasikkhāsutta*

"Mendicants, each fortnight over a hundred and fifty training rules come
up for recitation, in which gentlemen who care for their own welfare
train. These are all included in the three trainings. What three? The
training in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom.
These are the three trainings that include them all.

Take the case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics, but has
limited immersion and wisdom. They break some lesser and minor training
rules, but are restored. Why is that? Because I don't say they're
incapable of that. But they're constant and steady in their precepts
regarding the training rules that are fundamental, befitting the
spiritual path. They keep the rules they've undertaken. With the ending
of three fetters they're a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in
the underworld, bound for awakening.

Take another case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics, but has
limited immersion and wisdom. They break some lesser and minor training
rules, but are restored. Why is that? Because I don't say they're
incapable of that. But they're constant and steady in their precepts
regarding the training rules that are fundamental, befitting the
spiritual path. They keep the rules they've undertaken. With the ending
of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion,
they're a once-returner. They come back to this world once only, then
make an end of suffering.

Take another case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics and
immersion, but has limited wisdom. They break some lesser and minor
training rules, but are restored. Why is that? Because I don't say
they're incapable of that. But they're constant and steady in their
precepts regarding the training rules that are fundamental, befitting
the spiritual path. They keep the rules they've undertaken. With the
ending of the five lower fetters they're reborn spontaneously. They are
extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.

Take another case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics,
immersion, and wisdom. They break some lesser and minor training rules,
but are restored. Why is that? Because I don't say they're incapable of
that. But they're constant and steady in their precepts regarding the
training rules that are fundamental, befitting the spiritual path. They
keep the rules they've undertaken. They realize the undefiled freedom of
heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having
realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.

So, mendicants, if you practice partially you succeed partially. If you
practice fully you succeed fully. These training rules are not a waste,
I say."

### N 3.87 Training (2nd)  *Dutiyasikkhāsutta*

"Mendicants, each fortnight over a hundred and fifty training rules come
up for recitation, in which gentlemen who care for their own welfare
train. These are all included in the three trainings. What three? The
training in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom.
These are the three trainings that include them all.

Take the case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics, but has
limited immersion and wisdom. They break some lesser and minor training
rules, but are restored. Why is that? Because I don't say they're
incapable of that. But they're constant and steady in their precepts
regarding the training rules that are fundamental, befitting the
spiritual life. They keep the rules they've undertaken. With the ending
of three fetters they have at most seven rebirths. They will
transmigrate at most seven times among gods and humans and then make an
end of suffering. With the ending of three fetters, they go from family
to family. They will transmigrate between two or three families and then
make an end of suffering. With the ending of three fetters, they're a
one-seeder. They will be reborn just one time in a human existence, then
make an end of suffering. With the ending of three fetters, and the
weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, they're a once-returner. They
come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.

Take another case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics and
immersion, but has limited wisdom. They break some lesser and minor
training rules, but are restored. Why is that? Because I don't say
they're incapable of that. But they're constant and steady in their
precepts regarding the training rules that are fundamental, befitting
the spiritual path. They keep the rules they've undertaken. With the
ending of the five lower fetters they head upstream, going to the
[Akaniṭṭha]{lang="sa"} realm. With the ending of the five lower fetters
they're extinguished with extra effort. With the ending of the five
lower fetters they're extinguished without extra effort. With the ending
of the five lower fetters they're extinguished upon landing. With the
ending of the five lower fetters they're extinguished between one life
and the next.

Take another case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics,
immersion, and wisdom. They break some lesser and minor training rules,
but are restored. Why is that? Because I don't say they're incapable of
that. But they're constant and steady in their precepts regarding the

### N 3.88 Training (3rd)  *Tatiyasikkhāsutta*

"Mendicants, each fortnight over a hundred and fifty training rules come

But they're constant and steady in their precepts regarding the training
rules that are fundamental, befitting the spiritual path. They keep the
rules they've undertaken.

They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in
this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight
due to the ending of defilements.

If they don't penetrate so far, with the ending of the five lower
fetters they're extinguished between one life and the next.

If they don't penetrate so far, with the ending of the five lower
fetters they're extinguished upon landing.

If they don't penetrate so far, with the ending of the five lower

So, mendicants, if you practice fully you succeed fully. If you practice
partially you succeed partially. These training rules are not a waste, I
say."

### N 3.89 Three Trainings (1st)  *Paṭhamasikkhattayasutta*

"Mendicants, these are the three trainings. What three? The training in
the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom.

And what is the training in the higher ethics? It's when a mendicant is
ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and
resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest
fault, they keep the rules they've undertaken. This is called the
training in the higher ethics.

And what is the training in the higher mind? It's when a mendicant,
quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful
qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption ... second
absorption ... third absorption ... fourth absorption. This is called
the training in the higher mind.

And what is the training in the higher wisdom? They truly understand:
'This is suffering' ... 'This is the origin of suffering' ... 'This is
the cessation of suffering' ... 'This is the practice that leads to the
cessation of suffering'. This is called the training in the higher
wisdom. These are the three trainings."

### N 3.91 At Paṅkadhā  *Saṅkavāsutta*

At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans
together with a large [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"} of mendicants. He arrived at a
town of the Kosalans named [Paṅkadhā]{lang="sa"}, and stayed there.

Now, at that time a monk called Kassapagotta was resident at
[Paṅkadhā]{lang="sa"}. There the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up,
and inspired the mendicants with a Dhamma talk about the training rules.
Kassapagotta became quite impatient and bitter, thinking, "This ascetic
is much too strict."

When the Buddha had stayed in [Paṅkadhā]{lang="sa"} as long as he
pleased, he set out for [Rājagaha]{lang="sa"}. Traveling stage by stage,
he arrived at [Rājagaha]{lang="sa"}, and stayed there.

Soon after the Buddha left, Kassapagotta became quite remorseful and
regretful, thinking, "It's my loss, my misfortune, that when the Buddha
was talking about the training rules I became quite impatient and
bitter, thinking he was much too strict. Why don't I go to the Buddha
and confess my mistake to him?"

Then Kassapagotta set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and
robe, set out for [Rājagaha]{lang="sa"}. Eventually he came to
[Rājagaha]{lang="sa"} and the Vulture's Peak. He went up to the Buddha,
bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened, saying:

"I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of
me to become impatient and bitter when the Buddha was educating,
encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk
about the training rules, and to think, 'This ascetic is much too
strict.' Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will
restrain myself in future."

"Indeed, Kassapa, you made a mistake. But since you have recognized your
mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it.
For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake
for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the
future.

Kassapa, take the case of a senior mendicant who doesn't want to train
and doesn't praise taking up the training. They don't encourage other
mendicants who don't want to train to take up the training. And they
don't truthfully and correctly praise at the right time those mendicants
who do want to train. I don't praise that kind of senior mendicant. Why
is that? Because, hearing that I praised that mendicant, other
mendicants might want to keep company with them. Then they might follow
their example, which would be for their lasting harm and suffering.
That's why I don't praise that kind of senior mendicant.

Take the case of a middle mendicant who doesn't want to train ...

Take the case of a junior mendicant who doesn't want to train ... That's
why I don't praise that kind of junior mendicant.

Kassapa, take the case of a senior mendicant who does want to train and
praises taking up the training. They encourage other mendicants who
don't want to train to take up the training. And they truthfully and
correctly praise at the right time those mendicants who do want to
train. I praise that kind of senior mendicant. Why is that? Because,
hearing that I praised that mendicant, other mendicants might want to
keep company with them. Then they might follow their example, which
would be for their lasting welfare and happiness. That's why I praise
that kind of senior mendicant.

Take the case of a middle mendicant who wants to train ...

Take the case of a junior mendicant who wants to train ... That's why I
praise that kind of junior mendicant."
