# The Chapter on Deeds of Substance


### N 4.61 Fitting Deeds *Pattakammasutta*

Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha,
bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:

"Householder, these four things, which are likable, desirable, and
agreeable are hard to get in the world. What four? The first thing is
the wish: 'May wealth come to me by legitimate means!'

The second thing, having got wealth by legitimate means, is the wish:
'May fame come to me, together with my family and teachers.'

The third thing, having got wealth and fame, is the wish: 'May I live
long, keeping alive for a long time!'

The fourth thing, having got wealth, fame, and long life, is the wish:
'When my body breaks up, after death, may I be reborn in a good place, a
heavenly realm!' These are the four things, which are likable,
desirable, and agreeable, but hard to get in the world.

These next four things lead to the getting of those four things. What
four? Accomplishment in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom.

And what is accomplishment in faith? It's when a noble disciple has
faith in the Realized One's awakening: 'That Blessed One is perfected, a
fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy,
knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher
of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.' This is called accomplishment in
faith.

And what is accomplishment in ethics? It's when a noble disciple doesn't
kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or consume
beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants. This is called accomplishment in
ethics.

And what is accomplishment in generosity? It's when a noble disciple
lives at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous,
open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and
to share. This is called accomplishment in generosity.

And what is accomplishment in wisdom? When your heart is mastered by
covetousness and immoral greed, you do what you shouldn't, and fail to
do what you should. Your fame and happiness fall to dust. When your
heart is mastered by ill will ... dullness and drowsiness ...
restlessness and remorse ... doubt, you do what you shouldn't, and fail
to do what you should. Your fame and happiness fall to dust.

Knowing that 'covetousness and immoral greed are corruptions of the
mind', that noble disciple gives them up. Knowing that 'ill will ...'
... 'dullness and drowsiness ...' ... 'restlessness and remorse ...' ...
'doubt is a corruption of the mind', that noble disciple gives it up.

When a noble disciple has given up these things, they're called 'a noble
disciple of great wisdom, of widespread wisdom, who sees what matters,
and is accomplished in wisdom'. This is called accomplishment in wisdom.
These are the four things that lead to the getting of the four things,
which are likable, desirable, and agreeable, but hard to get in the
world.

There are four fitting deeds that a noble disciple does with the
legitimate wealth he has earned by his efforts and initiative, built up
with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow. What four?

To start with, with his legitimate wealth he makes himself happy and
pleased, keeping himself properly happy. He makes his mother and father
happy ... He makes his children, partners, bondservants, workers, and
staff happy ... He makes his friends and colleagues happy ... This is
his first expenditure in an appropriate sphere on a deserved and fitting
cause.

Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he defends himself against
threats from such things as fire, flood, rulers, bandits, or unloved
heirs. He keeps himself safe. This is his second expenditure in an
appropriate sphere on a deserved and fitting cause.

Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he makes five spirit-offerings:
to relatives, guests, ancestors, king, and deities. This is his third
expenditure in an appropriate sphere on a deserved and fitting cause.

Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he establishes an uplifting
religious donation for ascetics and brahmins---those who refrain from
intoxication and negligence, are settled in patience and sweetness, and
who tame, calm, and extinguish themselves---that's conducive to heaven,
ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven. This is his fourth expenditure
in an appropriate sphere on a deserved and fitting cause.

'these are the four fitting deeds that a noble disciple does with the
legitimate wealth he has earned by his efforts and initiative, built up
with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow.

Whatever wealth is spent on something other than these four fitting
deeds is said to not be expenditure in an appropriate sphere on a
deserved and fitting cause. But whatever wealth is spent on these four
fitting deeds is said to be expenditure in an appropriate sphere on a
deserved and fitting cause.

> 'I've enjoyed my wealth,\
> \>supporting those who depend on me;\
> I've overcome losses;\
> I've given uplifting religious donations;\
> and made the five spirit-offerings.\
> I have served the ethical and\
> disciplined spiritual practitioners.
>
> I've achieved the purpose\
> for which an astute lay person\
> wishes to gain wealth.\
> I don't regret what I've done.'
>
> A mortal person who recollects this\
> stands firm in the teaching of the noble ones.\
> They're praised in this life,\
> and they depart to rejoice in heaven."

### N 4.62 Debtlessness *Ānaṇyasutta*

Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha,
bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:

"Householder, these four kinds of happiness can be earned by a layperson
who enjoys sensual pleasures, depending on time and occasion. What four?
The happiness of ownership, using wealth, debtlessness, and
blamelessness.

And what is the happiness of ownership? It's when a gentleman owns
legitimate wealth that he has earned by his own efforts and initiative,
built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow. When he
reflects on this, he's filled with pleasure and happiness. This is
called 'the happiness of ownership'.

And what is the happiness of using wealth? It's when a gentleman uses
his legitimate wealth, and makes merit with it. When he reflects on
this, he's filled with pleasure and happiness. This is called 'the
happiness of using wealth'.

And what is the happiness of debtlessness? It's when a gentleman owes no
debt, large or small, to anyone. When he reflects on this, he's filled
with pleasure and happiness. This is called 'the happiness of
debtlessness'.

And what is the happiness of blamelessness? It's when a noble disciple
has blameless conduct by way of body, speech, and mind. When he reflects
on this, he's filled with pleasure and happiness. This is called 'the
happiness of blamelessness'.

These four kinds of happiness can be earned by a layperson who enjoys
sensual pleasures, depending on time and occasion.

> Knowing the happiness of debtlessness,\
> and the extra happiness of possession,\
> a mortal enjoying the happiness of using wealth,\
> then discerns clearly with wisdom.
>
> Discerning clearly, a clever person knows\
> both kinds of happiness:\
> the other kind is not worth a sixteenth part\
> of the happiness of blamelessness."

### N 4.63 Living with Divinity *Brahmasutta*

"Mendicants, a family where the children honor their parents in their
home is said to live with divinity. A family where the children honor
their parents in their home is said to live with the first tutors. A
family where the children honor their parents in their home is said to
live with the old deities. A family where the children honor their
parents in their home is said to live with those worthy of offerings
dedicated to the gods.

'Divinity' is a term for your parents.

'First tutors' is a term for your parents.

'Old deities' is a term for your parents.

'Worthy of an offering dedicated to the gods' is a term for your
parents.

Why is that? Parents are very helpful to their children, they raise
them, nurture them, and show them the world.

> Parents are said to be 'Divinity'\
> and 'first tutors'.\
> They're worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods\
> \>from their children,\
> for they love their offspring.
>
> Therefore an astute person\
> would revere them and honor them\
> with food and drink,\
> clothes and bedding,\
> by anointing and bathing,\
> and by washing their feet.
>
> Because they look after\
> their parents like this,\
> they're praised in this life by the astute,\
> and they depart to rejoice in heaven."

### N 4.64 Hell *Nirayasutta*

"Mendicants, someone with four qualities is cast down to hell. What
four? They kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, and
lie. Someone with these four qualities is cast down to hell.

> Killing, stealing,\
> telling lies,\
> and visiting others' wives:\
> astute people don't praise these things."

<!--pg-->
### N 4.65 Appearance *Rūpasutta*

"Mendicants, these four people are found in the world. What four? There
are those whose estimation of and confidence in others is based on their
appearance, on their voice, on their mortification, and on principle.

These are the four people found in the world.

> Those who judge on appearance,\
> and those swayed by a voice,\
> are full of desire and greed;\
> those people just don't understand.
>
> Not knowing what's inside,\
> nor seeing what's outside,\
> the fool shut in on every side,\
> gets carried away by a voice.
>
> Not knowing what's inside,\
> but discerning what's outside,\
> seeing the fruit outside,\
> they're also carried away by a voice.
>
> Understanding what's inside,\
> and discerning what's outside,\
> seeing without hindrances,\
> they don't get carried away by a voice."

<!--pg-->
### N 4.66 Greedy *Sarāgasutta*

"Mendicants, these four people are found in the world. What four? The
greedy, the hateful, the delusional, and the conceited.

These are the four people found in the world.

> Full of desire for desirable things,\
> enjoying things that seem pleasant,\
> beings veiled by delusion\
> only tighten their bonds.
>
> Born of greed, born of hate,\
> born of delusion: the ignorant\
> do unskillful deeds\
> that afflict and produce pain.
>
> If you act out of these qualities,\
> \>that's what you become.\
> But men shrouded by ignorance,\
> are blind, with no eyes to see,\
> and they never imagine that this could be so."

### N 4.67 The Snake King *Ahirājasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

Now, at that time a monk in Sāvatthī passed away due to a
snake bite. Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat
down to one side, and said to him, "Sir, a monk in Sāvatthī
has passed away due to a snake bite."

"Mendicants, that monk mustn't have spread a mind of love to the four
royal snake families. If he had, he wouldn't have died due to a snake
bite.

What four? The royal snake families of Virūpakkha,
Erāpatha, Chabyāputta, and
Kaṇhāgotamaka. ...

Mendicants, I urge you to spread a mind of love to the four royal snake
families, for your own safety, security, and protection.

> I love the Virūpakkhas,\
> the Erāpathas I love,\
> I love the Chabyāputtas,\
> the Kaṇhāgotamakas I love.
>
> I love the footless creatures,\
> the two-footed I love,\
> I love the four-footed,\
> the many-footed I love.
>
> May the footless not harm me!\
> May I not be harmed by the two-footed!\
> May the four-footed not harm me!\
> May I not be harmed by the many-footed!
>
> All sentient beings, all living things,\
> all creatures, every one:\
> may they see only nice things,\
> may bad not come to anyone.
>
> The Buddha is immeasurable,\
> the teaching is immeasurable,\
> the Saṅgha is immeasurable.\
> But limited are crawling things,
>
> snakes and scorpions, centipedes,\
> spiders and lizards and mice.\
> I've made this safeguard, I've made this protection:\
> go away, creatures!\
> And so I revere the Blessed One,\
> I revere the seven perfectly awakened Buddhas."

### N 4.68 Devadatta *Devadattasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the
Vulture's Peak Mountain, not long after Devadatta had left. There the
Buddha spoke to the mendicants about Devadatta:

"Possessions, honor, and popularity came to Devadatta for his own ruin
and downfall.

It's like a banana tree, or a bamboo, or a reed, all of which bear fruit
to their own ruin and downfall ...

It's like a mule, which becomes pregnant to its own ruin and downfall.
In the same way, possessions, honor, and popularity came to Devadatta
for his own ruin and downfall.

> The banana tree is destroyed by its own fruit,\
> as are the bamboo and the reed.\
> Honor destroys a sinner,\
> as pregnancy destroys a mule."

<!--pg-->
### N 4.69 Effort *Padhānasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these four efforts. What four? The efforts to
restrain, to give up, to develop, and to preserve.

And what, mendicants, is the effort to restrain? It's when you generate
enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad,
unskillful qualities don't arise. This is called the effort to restrain.

And what, mendicants, is the effort to give up? It's when you generate
enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad,
unskillful qualities are given up. This is called the effort to give up.

And what, mendicants, is the effort to develop? It's when you generate
enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that
skillful qualities arise. This is called the effort to develop.

And what, mendicants, is the effort to preserve? It's when you generate
enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that
skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase,
mature, and are fulfilled by development. This is called the effort to
preserve.

These are the four efforts.

> Restraint and giving up,\
> development and preservation:\
> these are the four efforts\
> taught by the kinsman of the Sun.\
> Any mendicant who keenly applies these\
> may attain the ending of suffering."

### N 4.70 Unprincipled *Adhammikasutta*

"At a time when kings are unprincipled, royal officials become
unprincipled. When royal officials are unprincipled, brahmins and
householders become unprincipled. When brahmins and householders are
unprincipled, the people of town and country become unprincipled. When
the people of town and country are unprincipled, the courses of the moon
and sun become erratic. ... the courses of the stars and constellations
... the days and nights ... the months and fortnights ... the seasons
and years become erratic. ... the blowing of the winds becomes erratic
and chaotic. ... the deities are angered. ... the heavens don't provide
enough rain. ... the crops ripen erratically. When people eat crops that
have ripened erratically, they become short-lived, ugly, weak, and
sickly.

At a time when kings are principled, royal officials become principled.
... brahmins and householders ... people of town and country become
principled. When the people of town and country are principled, the
courses of the sun and moon become regular. ... the stars and
constellations ... the days and nights ... the months and fortnights ...
the seasons and years become regular. ... the blowing of the winds
becomes regular and orderly. ... the deities are not angered ... ... the
heavens provide plenty of rain. When the heavens provide plenty of rain,
the crops ripen well. When people eat crops that have ripened well, they
become long-lived, beautiful, strong, and healthy.
