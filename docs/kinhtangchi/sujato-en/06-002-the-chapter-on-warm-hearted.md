# The Chapter on Warm-hearted

### AN 6.11 Warm-hearted (1st)  *Paṭhamasāraṇīyasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these six warm-hearted qualities. What six?

Firstly, a mendicant consistently treats their spiritual companions with
bodily kindness, both in public and in private. This is a warm-hearted
quality.

Furthermore, a mendicant consistently treats their spiritual companions
with verbal kindness, both in public and in private. This too is a
warm-hearted quality.

Furthermore, a mendicant consistently treats their spiritual companions
with mental kindness ...

Furthermore, a mendicant shares without reservation any material things
they have gained by legitimate means, even the food placed in the
alms-bowl, using them in common with their ethical spiritual companions.
This too is a warm-hearted quality.

Furthermore, a mendicant lives according to the precepts shared with
their spiritual companions, both in public and in private. Those
precepts are intact, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating,
praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. This
too is a warm-hearted quality.

Furthermore, a mendicant lives according to the view shared with their
spiritual companions, both in public and in private. That view is noble
and emancipating, and delivers one who practices it to the complete
ending of suffering. This too is a warm-hearted quality.

These are the six warm-hearted qualities."

respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.

### AN 6.13 Elements of Escape  *Nissāraṇīyasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these six elements of escape. What six?

Take a mendicant who says: 'I've developed the heart's release by love.
I've cultivated it, made it my vehicle and my basis, kept it up,
consolidated it, and properly implemented it. Yet somehow ill will still
occupies my mind.' They should be told, 'Not so, venerable! Don't say
that. Don't misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha
is not good. And the Buddha would not say that. It's impossible,
reverend, it cannot happen that the heart's release by love has been
developed and properly implemented, yet somehow ill will still occupies
the mind. For it is the heart's release by love that is the escape from
ill will.'

Take another mendicant who says: 'I've developed the heart's release by
compassion. I've cultivated it, made it my vehicle and my basis, kept it
up, consolidated it, and properly implemented it. Yet somehow the
thought of harming still occupies my mind.' They should be told, 'Not
so, venerable! ... For it is the heart's release by compassion that is
the escape from thoughts of harming.'

Take another mendicant who says: 'I've developed the heart's release by
rejoicing. I've cultivated it, made it my vehicle and my basis, kept it
up, consolidated it, and properly implemented it. Yet somehow discontent
still occupies my mind.' They should be told, 'Not so, venerable! ...
For it is the heart's release by rejoicing that is the escape from
discontent.'

Take another mendicant who says: 'I've developed the heart's release by
equanimity. I've cultivated it, made it my vehicle and my basis, kept it
up, consolidated it, and properly implemented it. Yet somehow desire
still occupies my mind.' They should be told, 'Not so, venerable! ...
For it is the heart's release by equanimity that is the escape from
desire.'

Take another mendicant who says: 'I've developed the signless release of
the heart. I've cultivated it, made it my vehicle and my basis, kept it
up, consolidated it, and properly implemented it. Yet somehow my
consciousness still follows after signs.' They should be told, 'Not so,
venerable! ... For it is the signless release of the heart that is the
escape from all signs.'

Take another mendicant who says: 'I'm rid of the conceit "I am". And I
don't regard anything as "I am this". Yet somehow the dart of doubt and
indecision still occupies my mind.' They should be told, 'Not so,
venerable! Don't say that. Don't misrepresent the Buddha, for
misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not
say that. It's impossible, reverend, it cannot happen that the conceit
"I am" has been done away with, and nothing is regarded as "I am this",
yet somehow the dart of doubt and indecision still occupies the mind.
For it is the uprooting of the conceit "I am" that is the escape from
the dart of doubt and indecision.'

These are the six elements of escape."

### AN 6.14 A Good Death  *Bhaddakasutta*

There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants: "Reverends,
mendicants!"

"Reverend," they replied. Sāriputta said this:

"A mendicant lives life so as to not have a good death. And how do they
live life so as to not have a good death?

Take a mendicant who relishes work, talk, sleep, company, closeness, and
proliferation. They love these things and like to relish them. A
mendicant who lives life like this does not have a good death. This is
called a mendicant who enjoys substantial reality, who hasn't given up
substantial reality to rightly make an end of suffering.

A mendicant lives life so as to have a good death. And how do they live
life so as to have a good death?

Take a mendicant who doesn't relish work, talk, sleep, company,
closeness, and proliferation. They don't love these things or like to
relish them. A mendicant who lives life like this has a good death. This
is called a mendicant who delights in extinguishment, who has given up
substantial reality to rightly make an end of suffering.

> A beast who likes to proliferate,\
> enjoying proliferation,\
> fails to win extinguishment,\
> the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.
>
> But one who gives up proliferation,\
> enjoying the state of non-proliferation,\
> wins extinguishment,\
> the supreme sanctuary from the yoke."

<!--pg-->
### AN 6.15 Regret  *Anutappiyasutta*

There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants:

"As a mendicant makes their bed, so they must lie in it, and die
tormented by regrets. And how do they die tormented by regrets?

Take a mendicant who relishes work, talk, sleep, company, closeness, and
proliferation. They love these things and like to relish them. A
mendicant who makes their bed like this must lie in it, and die
tormented by regrets. This is called a mendicant who enjoys substantial
reality, who hasn't given up substantial reality to rightly make an end
of suffering.

As a mendicant makes their bed, so they must lie in it, and die free of
regrets. And how do they die free of regrets?

Take a mendicant who doesn't relish work, talk, sleep, company,
closeness, and proliferation. They don't love these things or like to
relish them. A mendicant who makes their bed like this must lie in it,
and die free of regrets. This is called a mendicant who delights in
extinguishment, who has given up substantial reality to rightly make an
end of suffering.

### AN 6.16 Nakula's Father  *Nakulapitusutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas at
Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā's Wood. Now
at that time the householder Nakula's father was sick, suffering,
gravely ill. Then the housewife Nakula's mother said to him:

"Householder, don't pass away with concerns. Such concern is suffering,
and it's criticized by the Buddha. Householder, you might think: 'When
I've gone, the housewife Nakula's mother won't be able to provide for
the children and keep up the household carpets.' But you should not see
it like this. I'm skilled at spinning cotton and carding wool. I'm able
to provide for the children and keep up the household carpets. So
householder, don't pass away with concerns ...

Householder, you might think: 'When I've gone, the housewife Nakula's
mother will take another husband.' But you should not see it like this.
Both you and I know that we have remained celibate while at home for the
past sixteen years. So householder, don't pass away with concerns ...

Householder, you might think: 'When I've gone, the housewife Nakula's
mother won't want to see the Buddha and his Saṅgha of
mendicants.' But you should not see it like this. When you've gone, I'll
want to see the Buddha and his mendicant Saṅgha even more.
So householder, don't pass away with concerns ...

Householder, you might think: 'The housewife Nakula's mother won't
fulfill ethics.' But you should not see it like this. I am one of those
white-robed disciples of the Buddha who fulfills their ethics. Whoever
doubts this can go and ask the Buddha. He is staying in the land of the
Bhaggas at Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā's
Wood. So householder, don't pass away with concerns ...

Householder, you might think: 'The housewife Nakula's mother doesn't
have internal serenity of heart.' But you should not see it like this. I
am one of those white-robed disciples of the Buddha who has internal
serenity of heart. Whoever doubts this can go and ask the Buddha. He is
staying in the land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile Hill, in the deer park
at Bhesakaḷā's Wood. So householder, don't pass away with
concerns ...

Householder, you might think: 'The housewife Nakula's mother has not
gained a basis, a firm basis, and solace in this teaching and training.
She has not gone beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and gained
assurance. And she's not independent of others in the Teacher's
instructions.' But you should not see it like this. I am one of those
white-robed disciples of the Buddha who has gained a basis, a firm
basis, and solace in this teaching and training. I have gone beyond
doubt, got rid of indecision, and gained assurance. And I am independent
of others in the Teacher's instructions. Whoever doubts this can go and
ask the Buddha. He is staying in the land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile
Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā's Wood. So householder,
don't pass away with concerns. Such concern is suffering, and it's
criticized by the Buddha."

And then, as Nakula's mother was giving this advice to Nakula's father,
his illness died down on the spot. And that's how Nakula's father
recovered from that illness. Soon after recovering, leaning on a staff
he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said
to him:

"You're fortunate, householder, so very fortunate, to have the housewife
Nakula's mother advise and instruct you out of kindness and sympathy.

She is one of those white-robed disciples of the Buddha who fulfills
their ethics.

She is one of those white-robed disciples of the Buddha who has internal
serenity of heart.

She is one of those white-robed disciples of the Buddha who has gained a
basis, a firm basis, and solace in this teaching and training. She has
gone beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and gained assurance. And she
is independent of others in the Teacher's instructions.

You're fortunate, householder, so very fortunate, to have the housewife
Nakula's mother advise and instruct you out of kindness and sympathy."

### AN 6.17 Sleep  *Soppasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat, went to the
assembly hall, and sat down on the seat spread out. Venerable
Sāriputta also came out of retreat, went to the assembly
hall, bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side. Venerables
Mahāmoggallāna, Mahākassapa,
Mahākaccāna, Mahākoṭṭhita,
Mahācunda, Mahākappina, Anuruddha, Revata, and
Ānanda did the same. The Buddha spent much of the night sitting in
meditation, then got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. And soon
after the Buddha left those venerables each went to their own dwelling.

But those mendicants who were junior, recently gone forth, newly come to
this teaching and training slept until the sun came up, snoring. The
Buddha saw them doing this, with his clairvoyance that is purified and
superhuman. He went to the assembly hall, sat down on the seat spread
out, and addressed the mendicants:

"Mendicants, where is Sāriputta? Where are
Mahāmoggallāna, Mahākassapa,
Mahākaccāna, Mahākoṭṭhita,
Mahācunda, Mahākappina, Anuruddha, Revata, and
Ānanda? Where have these senior disciples gone?"

"Soon after the Buddha left those venerables each went to their own
dwelling."

"So, mendicants, when the senior mendicants left, why did you sleep
until the sun came up, snoring?

What do you think, mendicants? Have you ever seen or heard of an
anointed aristocratic king who rules his whole life, dear and beloved to
the country, while indulging in the pleasures of sleeping, lying down,
and drowsing as much as he likes?"

"No, sir."

"Good, mendicants! I too have never seen or heard of such a thing.

What do you think, mendicants? Have you ever seen or heard of an
appointed official ... a hereditary official ... a general ... a village
chief ... or a guild head who runs the guild his whole life, dear and
beloved to the guild, while indulging in the pleasures of sleeping,
lying down, and drowsing as much as he likes?"

"No, sir."

"Good, mendicants! I too have never seen or heard of such a thing.

What do you think, mendicants? Have you ever seen or heard of an ascetic
or brahmin who indulges in the pleasures of sleeping, lying down, and
drowsing as much as they like? Their sense doors are unguarded, they eat
too much, they're not dedicated to wakefulness, they're unable to
discern skillful qualities, and they don't pursue the development of the
qualities that lead to awakening in the evening and toward dawn. Yet
they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in
this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight
due to the ending of defilements."

"No, sir."

"Good, mendicants! I too have never seen or heard of such a thing.

So you should train like this: 'We will guard our sense doors, eat in
moderation, be dedicated to wakefulness, discern skillful qualities, and
pursue the development of the qualities that lead to awakening in the
evening and toward dawn.' That's how you should train."

### AN 6.18 A Fish Dealer  *Macchabandhasutta*

At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans
together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.

While walking along the road he saw a fish dealer in a certain spot
selling fish that he had killed himself. Seeing this he left the road,
sat at the root of a tree on the seat spread out, and addressed the
mendicants, "Mendicants, do you see that fish dealer selling fish that
he killed himself?"

"Yes, sir."

"What do you think, mendicants? Have you ever seen or heard of a fish
dealer selling fish that he killed himself who, by means of that work
and livelihood, got to travel by elephant, horse, chariot, or vehicle,
or to enjoy wealth, or to live off a large fortune?"

"No, sir."

"Good, mendicants! I too have never seen or heard of such a thing. Why
is that? Because when the fish are led to the slaughter he regards them
with bad intentions.

What do you think, mendicants? Have you ever seen or heard of a butcher
of cattle selling cattle that he killed himself who, by means of that
work and livelihood, got to travel by elephant, horse, chariot, or
vehicle, or to enjoy wealth, or to live off a large fortune?"

"No, sir."

"Good, mendicants! I too have never seen or heard of such a thing. Why
is that? Because when the cattle are led to the slaughter he regards
them with bad intentions.

What do you think, mendicants? Have you ever seen or heard of a butcher
of sheep ... a butcher of pigs ... a butcher of poultry ... or a
deer-hunter selling deer which he killed himself who, by means of that
work and livelihood, got to travel by elephant, horse, chariot, or
vehicle, or to enjoy wealth, or to live off a large fortune?"

"No, sir."

"Good, mendicants! I too have never seen or heard of such a thing. Why
is that? Because when the deer are led to the slaughter he regards them
with bad intentions.

By regarding even animals led to the slaughter with bad intentions he
did not get to travel by elephant, horse, chariot, or vehicle, or to
enjoy wealth, or to live off a large fortune. How much worse is someone
who regards human beings brought to the slaughter with bad intentions!
This will be for their lasting harm and suffering. When their body
breaks up, after death, they're reborn in a place of loss, a bad place,
the underworld, hell."

### AN 6.19 Mindfulness of Death (1st)  *Paṭhamamaraṇassatisutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying at Ñātika in the brick
house. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, when mindfulness of death is developed and cultivated it's
very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in freedom from death and
ends in freedom from death. But do you develop mindfulness of death?"

When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha, "Sir, I
develop mindfulness of death."

"But mendicant, how do you develop it?"

"In this case, sir, I think: 'Oh, if I'd only live for another day and
night, I'd focus on the Buddha's instructions and I could really achieve
a lot.' That's how I develop mindfulness of death."

Another mendicant said to the Buddha, "Sir, I too develop mindfulness of
death."

"But mendicant, how do you develop it?"

"In this case, sir, I think: 'Oh, if I'd only live for another day, I'd
focus on the Buddha's instructions and I could really achieve a lot.'
That's how I develop mindfulness of death."

Another mendicant said to the Buddha, "Sir, I too develop mindfulness of
death."

"But mendicant, how do you develop it?"

"In this case, sir, I think: 'Oh, if I'd only live as long as it takes
to eat a meal of almsfood, I'd focus on the Buddha's instructions and I
could really achieve a lot.' That's how I develop mindfulness of death."

Another mendicant said to the Buddha, "Sir, I too develop mindfulness of
death."

"But mendicant, how do you develop it?"

"In this case, sir, I think: 'Oh, if I'd only live as long as it takes
to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls, I'd focus on the Buddha's
instructions and I could really achieve a lot.' That's how I develop
mindfulness of death."

Another mendicant said to the Buddha, "Sir, I too develop mindfulness of
death."

"But mendicant, how do you develop it?"

"In this case, sir, I think: 'Oh, if I'd only live as long as it takes
to chew and swallow a single mouthful, I'd focus on the Buddha's
instructions and I could really achieve a lot.' That's how I develop
mindfulness of death."

Another mendicant said to the Buddha, "Sir, I too develop mindfulness of
death."

"But mendicant, how do you develop it?"

"In this case, sir, I think: 'Oh, if I'd only live as long as it takes
to breathe out after breathing in, or to breathe in after breathing out,
I'd focus on the Buddha's instructions and I could really achieve a
lot.' That's how I develop mindfulness of death."

When this was said, the Buddha said to those mendicants:

"As to the mendicants who develop mindfulness of death by wishing to
live for a day and night ... or to live for a day ... or to live as long
as it takes to eat a meal of almsfood ... or to live as long as it takes
to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls---these are called mendicants
who live negligently. They slackly develop mindfulness of death for the
ending of defilements.

But as to the mendicants who develop mindfulness of death by wishing to
live as long as it takes to chew and swallow a single mouthful ... or to
live as long as it takes to breathe out after breathing in, or to
breathe in after breathing out---these are called mendicants who live
diligently. They keenly develop mindfulness of death for the ending of
defilements.

So you should train like this: 'We will live diligently. We will keenly
develop mindfulness of death for the ending of defilements.' That's how
you should train."

<!--pg-->
### AN 6.20 Mindfulness of Death (2nd)  *Dutiyamaraṇassatisutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying at Ñātika in the brick
house. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:

"Mendicants, when mindfulness of death is developed and cultivated it's
very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in freedom from death and
ends in freedom from death. And how is mindfulness of death developed
and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficial, to culminate in
freedom from death and end in freedom from death?

As day passes by and night draws close, a mendicant reflects: 'I might
die of many causes. A snake might bite me, or a scorpion or centipede
might sting me. And if I died from that it would be an obstacle to me.
Or I might stumble off a cliff, or get food poisoning, or suffer a
disturbance of bile, phlegm, or piercing winds. And if I died from that
it would be an obstacle to my progress. ' That mendicant should reflect:
'Are there any bad, unskillful qualities that I haven't given up, which
might be an obstacle to my progress if I die tonight?'

Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that there are such bad,
unskillful qualities. Then in order to give them up they should apply
intense enthusiasm, effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and
situational awareness. Suppose your clothes or head were on fire. In
order to extinguish it, you'd apply intense enthusiasm, effort, zeal,
vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness. In the same
way, in order to give up those bad, unskillful qualities, that mendicant
should apply intense enthusiasm ...

But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that there are no
such bad, unskillful qualities. Then that mendicant should meditate with
rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.

Or else, as night passes by and day draws close, a mendicant reflects:
'I might die of many causes. A snake might bite me, or a scorpion or
centipede might sting me. And if I died from that it would be an
obstacle to my progress. Or I might stumble off a cliff, or get food
poisoning, or suffer a disturbance of bile, phlegm, or piercing winds.
And if I died from that it would be an obstacle to my progress. ' That
mendicant should reflect: 'Are there any bad, unskillful qualities that
I haven't given up, which might be an obstacle to my progress if I die
today?'

Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that there are such bad,
unskillful qualities. Then in order to give them up they should apply
intense enthusiasm, effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and
situational awareness. Suppose your clothes or head were on fire. In
order to extinguish it, you'd apply intense enthusiasm, effort, zeal,
vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness. In the same
way, in order to give up those bad, unskillful qualities, that mendicant
should apply intense enthusiasm ...

But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that there are no
such bad, unskillful qualities. Then that mendicant should meditate with
rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.

Mindfulness of death, when developed and cultivated in this way, is very
fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in freedom from death and ends in
freedom from death."
