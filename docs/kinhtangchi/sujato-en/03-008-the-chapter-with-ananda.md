# The Chapter with Ānanda

### N 3.71 With Channa  *Channasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Then the wanderer Channa
went up to Venerable Ānanda and exchanged greetings with him. When the
greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and
said to Ānanda:

"Reverend Ānanda, do you advocate giving up greed, hate, and delusion?"

"We do, reverend."

"But what drawbacks have you seen, Reverend Ānanda, that you advocate
giving up greed, hate, and delusion?"

"A greedy person, overcome by greed, intends to hurt themselves, hurt
others, and hurt both. They experience mental pain and sadness. When
greed has been given up, they don't intend to hurt themselves, hurt
others, and hurt both. They don't experience mental pain and sadness. A
greedy person does bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. When
greed has been given up, they don't do bad things by way of body,
speech, and mind. A greedy person doesn't truly understand what's for
their own good, the good of another, or the good of both. When greed has
been given up, they truly understand what's for their own good, the good
of another, or the good of both. Greed is a destroyer of sight, vision,
and knowledge. It blocks wisdom, it's on the side of distress, and it
doesn't lead to extinguishment.

A hateful person, overcome by hate, intends to hurt themselves, hurt
others, and hurt both. ...

A deluded person, overcome by delusion, intends to hurt themselves, hurt
others, and hurt both. They experience mental pain and sadness. When
delusion has been given up, they don't intend to hurt themselves, hurt
others, and hurt both. They don't experience mental pain and sadness. A
deluded person does bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. When
delusion has been given up, they don't do bad things by way of body,
speech, and mind. A deluded person doesn't truly understand what's for
their own good, the good of another, or the good of both. When delusion
has been given up, they truly understand what's for their own good, the
good of another, or the good of both. Delusion is a destroyer of sight,
vision, and knowledge; it blocks wisdom, it's on the side of distress,
and it doesn't lead to extinguishment.

This is the drawback we've seen in greed, hate, and delusion, and this
is why we advocate giving them up."

"But, reverend, is there a path and a practice for giving up that greed,
hate, and delusion?"

"There is, reverend, a path and a practice for giving up that greed,
hate, and delusion."

"Well, what is it?"

"It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right
thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort,
right mindfulness, and right immersion. This is the path, this is the
practice for giving up that greed, hate, and delusion."

"This is a fine path, a fine practice, for giving up that greed, hate,
and delusion. Just this much is enough to be diligent."

### N 3.72 A Disciple of the Ājīvakas  *Ājīvakasutta*

At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Kosambī, in
Ghosita's Monastery. Then a householder who was a disciple of the
Ājīvaka ascetics went up to Venerable Ānanda, bowed, sat
down to one side, and said to Ānanda:

"Honorable Ānanda, whose teaching is well explained? Who in the world is
practicing well? Who in the world has done well?"

"Well then, householder, I'll ask you about this in return, and you can
answer as you like. What do you think, householder? Is the teaching of
those who teach for giving up greed, hate, and delusion well explained
or not? Or how do you see this?"

"The teaching of those who teach for giving up greed, hate, and delusion
is well explained. That's how I see it."

"What do you think, householder? Are those who practice for giving up
greed, hate, and delusion practicing well or not? Or how do you see
this?"

"Those who practice for giving up greed, hate, and delusion are
practicing well. That's how I see it."

"What do you think, householder? Have those who've given up greed, hate,
and delusion---so they're cut off at the root, made like a palm stump,
obliterated, and unable to arise in the future---done well in the world,
or not? Or how do you see this?"

"Those who've given up greed, hate, and delusion have done well in the
world. That's how I see it."

"So, householder, you've declared: 'The teaching of those who teach for
giving up greed, hate, and delusion is well explained.' And you've
declared: 'Those who practice for giving up greed, hate, and delusion
are practicing well.' And you've declared: 'Those who've given up greed,
hate, and delusion have done well in the world.'"

"It's incredible, sir, it's amazing! There's no acclaiming your own
teaching or disrespecting someone else's, just teaching what's relevant
in that context. The goal is spoken of, but the self is not involved.
You, sir, teach Dhamma for giving up greed, hate, and delusion. Your
teaching is well explained. You, sir, practice for giving up greed,
hate, and delusion. You in the world are practicing well. You've given
up greed, hate, and delusion. You in the world have done well.

Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or
revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting
a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what's there,
Master Ānanda has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge
to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant
Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Master Ānanda remember me
as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."

### N 3.73 With Mahānāma the Sakyan  *Mahānāmasakkasutta*

So I have heard.At one time the Buddha was staying in the
land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. Now
at that time the Buddha had recently recovered from an illness. Then
Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down
to one side, and said to him:

"For a long time, sir, I have understood your teaching like this:
'Knowledge is for those with immersion, not those without immersion.'
But, sir, does immersion come first, then knowledge? Or does knowledge
come first, then immersion?"

Then Venerable Ānanda thought, "The Buddha has recently recovered from
an illness, and this Mahānāma asks him a question that's
too deep. Why don't I take him off to one side and teach him the
Dhamma?"

Then Ānanda took Mahānāma by the arm, led him off to one
side, and said to him, "Mahānāma, the Buddha has spoken of
the ethics, immersion, and wisdom of a trainee; and the ethics,
immersion, and wisdom of an adept. What is the ethics of a trainee? It's
when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting
themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger
in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they've undertaken. This is
called the ethics of a trainee.

And what is the immersion of a trainee? It's when a mendicant, quite
secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities,
enters and remains in the first absorption ... second absorption ...
third absorption ... fourth absorption. This is called the immersion of
a trainee.

And what is the wisdom of a trainee? They truly understand: 'This is
suffering' ... 'This is the origin of suffering' ... 'This is the
cessation of suffering' ... 'This is the practice that leads to the
cessation of suffering'. This is called the wisdom of a trainee.

Then a noble disciple---accomplished in ethics, immersion, and
wisdom---realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom
in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own
insight due to the ending of defilements.

In this way the Buddha has spoken of the ethics, immersion, and wisdom
of both a trainee and an adept."

### N 3.74 Jains  *Nigaṇṭhasutta*

At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Vesālī, at
the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then the Licchavis
Abhaya and Paṇḍitakumāra went up to Venerable Ānanda,
bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan claims to be
all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without
exception, thus: 'Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually
present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.' He
advocates the elimination of past deeds by fervent mortification, and
breaking the bridge by not doing any new deeds. So with the ending of
deeds, suffering ends; with the ending of suffering, feeling ends; and
with the ending of feeling, all suffering will have been worn away. This
is how to go beyond suffering by means of this purification by wearing
away in the present life. What, sir, does the Buddha say about this?"

"Abhaya, these three kinds of purification by wearing away have been
rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected
one, the fully awakened Buddha. They are in order to purify sentient
beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and
sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment. What
three?

It's when, Abhaya, a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic
code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable
places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules
they've undertaken. They don't perform any new deeds, and old deeds are
eliminated by experiencing their results little by little. This wearing
away is apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting
inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for
themselves.

Then a mendicant accomplished in ethics, quite secluded from sensual
pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the
first absorption ... second absorption ... third absorption ... fourth
absorption. They don't perform any new deeds, and old deeds are
eliminated by experiencing their results little by little. This wearing
away is apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting
inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for
themselves.

Then a mendicant accomplished in immersion realizes the undefiled
freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live
having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of
defilements. They don't perform any new deeds, and old deeds are
eliminated by experiencing their results little by little. This wearing
away is apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting
inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for
themselves.

These are the three kinds of purification by wearing away that have been
rightly explained by the Buddha ... in order to realize extinguishment."

When he said this, Paṇḍitakumāra said to Abhaya, "Dear
Abhaya, is there anything in what Ānanda has said so well that you would
disagree with?"

"How could I not agree with what was said so well by Ānanda? If anyone
didn't agree with him, their head would explode!"

### N 3.75 Support  *Nivesakasutta*

Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one
side. The Buddha said to him:

"Ānanda, those who you have sympathy for, and those worth listening
to---friends and colleagues, relatives and family---should be
encouraged, supported, and established in three things. What three?

Experiential confidence in the Buddha: 'That Blessed One is perfected, a
fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy,
knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher
of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.'

Experiential confidence in the teaching: 'The teaching is well explained
by the Buddha---apparent in the present life, immediately effective,
inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for
themselves.'

Experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: 'The
Saṅgha of the Buddha's disciples is practicing the way
that's good, sincere, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four
pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the
Buddha's disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods,
worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of
greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the
world.'

There might be change in the four principal states---earth, water, air,
and fire---but a noble disciple with experiential confidence in the
Buddha would never change. In this context, 'change' means that such a
noble disciple will be reborn in hell, the animal realm, or the ghost
realm: this is quite impossible.

Those who you have sympathy for, and those worth listening to---friends

### N 3.76 Continued Existence (1st)  *Paṭhamabhavasutta*

Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to him:

"Sir, they speak of this thing called 'continued existence'. How is
continued existence defined?"

"If, Ānanda, there were no deeds to result in the sensual realm, would
continued existence in the sensual realm still come about?"

"No, sir."

"So, Ānanda, deeds are the field, consciousness is the seed, and craving
is the moisture. The consciousness of sentient beings---shrouded by
ignorance and fettered by craving---is established in a lower realm.
That's how there is rebirth into a new state of existence in the future.

If there were no deeds to result in the realm of luminous form, would
continued existence in the realm of luminous form still come about?"

"No, sir."

"So, Ānanda, deeds are the field, consciousness is the seed, and craving
is the moisture. The consciousness of sentient beings---shrouded by
ignorance and fettered by craving---is established in a middle realm.
That's how there is rebirth into a new state of existence in the future.

If there were no deeds to result in the formless realm, would continued
existence in the formless realm still come about?"

"No, sir."

"So, Ānanda, deeds are the field, consciousness is the seed, and craving
is the moisture. The consciousness of sentient beings---shrouded by
ignorance and fettered by craving---is established in a higher realm.
That's how there is rebirth into a new state of existence in the future.
That's how continued existence is defined."

<!--pg-->
### N 3.77 Continued Existence (2nd)  *Dutiyabhavasutta*

Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to him:

"Sir, they speak of this thing called 'continued existence'. How is
continued existence defined?"

"If, Ānanda, there were no deeds to result in the sensual realm, would
continued existence in the sensual realm still come about?"

"No, sir."

"So, Ānanda, deeds are the field, consciousness is the seed, and craving
is the moisture. The intention and aim of sentient beings---shrouded by
ignorance and fettered by craving---is established in a lower realm.
That's how there is rebirth into a new state of existence in the future.

If there were no deeds to result in the realm of luminous form, would
continued existence in the realm of luminous form still come about?"

"No, sir."

"So, Ānanda, deeds are the field, consciousness is the seed, and craving
is the moisture. The intention and aim of sentient beings---shrouded by
ignorance and fettered by craving---is established in a middle realm.
That's how there is rebirth into a new state of existence in the future.

If there were no deeds to result in the formless realm, would continued
existence in the formless realm still come about?"

"No, sir."

"So, deeds are the field, consciousness is the seed, and craving is the
moisture. The intention and aim of sentient beings---shrouded by
ignorance and fettered by craving---is established in a higher realm.
That's how there is rebirth into a new state of existence in the future.
That's how continued existence is defined."

### N 3.78 Precepts and Observances  *Sīlabbatasutta*

Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one
side. The Buddha said to him: "Ānanda, are all precepts and observances,
lifestyles, and spiritual paths fruitful when taken as the essence?"

"This matter is not categorical, sir."

"Well then, Ānanda, break it down."

"Take the case of someone who cultivates precepts and observances, a
lifestyle, and a spiritual path, taking this as the essence. If
unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline, that's not
fruitful. However, if unskillful qualities decline while skillful
qualities grow, that is fruitful."

That's what Ānanda said, and the teacher approved.

Then Ānanda, knowing that the teacher approved, got up from his seat,
bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right,
before leaving. Then, not long after Ānanda had left, the Buddha
addressed the mendicants: "Mendicants, Ānanda is a trainee, but it's not
easy to find his equal in wisdom."

<!--pg-->
### N 3.79 Fragrances  *Gandhajātasutta*

Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to him:

"Sir, there are these three kinds of fragrance that spread only with the
wind, not against it. What three? The fragrance of roots, heartwood, and
flowers. These are the three kinds of fragrance that spread only with
the wind, not against it. Is there a kind of fragrance that spreads with
the wind, and against it, and both ways?"

"There is, Ānanda, such a kind of fragrance."

"So what, sir, is that kind of fragrance?"

"It's when, Ānanda, in some village or town, a woman or man has gone for
refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha. They
don't kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or
consume beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants. They're ethical, of good
character. They live at home with a heart rid of the stain of
stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to
charity, loving to give and to share.

Ascetics and brahmins everywhere praise them for these good qualities;
even the deities praise them. This is the kind of fragrance that spreads
with the wind, and against it, and both.

> The fragrance of flowers\
> \>doesn't spread against the wind,\
> nor sandalwood, pinwheel flowers, or jasmine;\
> but the fragrance of the good\
> \>spreads against the wind;\
> a true person's virtue spreads in every direction."

### N 3.80 Lesser  *Cūḷanikāsutta*

Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to him:

"Sir, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
'Ānanda, the Buddha Sikhī had a disciple called
Abhibhū. Standing in the realm of divinity, he could make
his voice heard throughout the thousandfold galaxy.' I wonder how far a
Blessed One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha can make their
voice heard?"

"He was a disciple, Ānanda. Realized Ones are immeasurable."

For a second time ...

For a third time, Ānanda said to the Buddha: "... I wonder how far a
Blessed One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha can make their
voice heard?"

"Ānanda, have you heard of a thousandfold lesser world system, a
galaxy?"

"Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! Let the Buddha
speak. The mendicants will listen and remember it."

"Well then, Ānanda, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," Ānanda replied. The Buddha said this:

"Ānanda, a galaxy extends a thousand times as far as the moon and sun
revolve and the shining ones light up the quarters. In that galaxy there
are a thousand moons, a thousand suns, a thousand Sinerus king of
mountains, a thousand Black Plum Tree Lands, a thousand Western
Continents, a thousand Northern Continents, a thousand Eastern
Continents, four thousand oceans, four thousand great kings, a thousand
realms of the gods of the four great kings, a thousand realms of the
gods of the thirty-three, of the gods of Yama, of the joyful gods, of
the gods who love to imagine, of the gods who control what is imagined
by others, and a thousand realms of divinity. This is called a
thousandfold lesser world system, a 'galaxy'.

A world system that extends for a thousand galaxies is called a
millionfold middling world system, a 'galactic cluster'.

A world system that extends for a thousand galactic clusters is called a
billionfold great world system, a 'galactic supercluster'.

If he wished, Ānanda, a Realized One could make his voice heard
throughout a galactic supercluster, or as far as he wants."

"But how would the Buddha make his voice heard so far?"

"First, Ānanda, a Realized One would fill the galactic supercluster with
light. When sentient beings saw the light, the Realized One would
project his call so that they'd hear the sound. That's how a Realized
One could make his voice heard throughout a galactic supercluster, or as
far as he wants."

When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said, "I'm so fortunate, so very
fortunate, to have a teacher with such power and might!"

When he said this, Venerable Udāyī said to Venerable
Ānanda, "What is it to you, Reverend Ānanda, if your teacher has such
power and might?"

When he said this, the Buddha said to Venerable Udāyī, "Not
so, Udāyī, not so! If Ānanda were to die while still not
free of greed, he would rule as king of the gods for seven lifetimes, or
as king of the Black Plum Tree Land for seven lifetimes, because of the
confidence of his heart. However, Ānanda will be fully extinguished in
this very life."
