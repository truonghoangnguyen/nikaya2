### AN 1.306--315 *Dutiyavagga*

306\. "Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to unskillful
qualities, or, when they have arisen, makes them increase and grow like
wrong view. When you have wrong view, unskillful qualities arise or,
when they have arisen, they increase and grow."

307\. "Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to skillful
qualities, or, when they have arisen, makes them increase and grow like
right view. When you have right view, unarisen skillful qualities arise
or, when they have arisen, they increase and grow."

<!--pg-->
308\. "Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to unskillful
qualities, or makes skillful qualities decline like wrong view. When you
have wrong view, unskillful qualities arise and skillful qualities
decline."

<!--pg-->
309\. "Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to skillful
qualities, or makes unskillful qualities decline like right view. When
you have right view, skillful qualities arise and unskillful qualities
decline."

<!--pg-->
310\. "Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to wrong view,
and once arisen, makes it grow like irrational application of mind. When
you apply the mind irrationally, wrong view arises, and once arisen it
grows."

<!--pg-->
311\. "Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to right view,
or, once it has already arisen, makes it grow like rational application
of mind. When you apply the mind rationally, right view arises, and once
arisen it grows."

<!--pg-->
312\. "Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that causes sentient beings to
be reborn, when their body breaks up, after death, in a place of loss, a
bad place, the underworld, hell like wrong view. It is because they have
wrong view that sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death,
are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell."

<!--pg-->
313\. "Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that causes sentient beings to
be reborn, when their body breaks up, after death, in a good place, a
heavenly realm like right view. It is because they have right view that
sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a
good place, a heavenly realm."

314\. "Mendicants, when an individual has wrong view, whatever bodily, verbal,
or mental deeds they undertake in line with that view, their intentions,
aims, wishes, and choices all lead to what is unlikable, undesirable,
disagreeable, harmful, and suffering. Why is that? Because their view is
bad. Suppose a seed of neem, angled gourd, or bitter gourd was planted
in moist earth. Whatever nutrients it takes up from the earth and water
would lead to its bitter, acerbic, and unpleasant taste. Why is that?
Because the seed is bad. In the same way, when an individual has wrong
view, whatever bodily, verbal, or mental deeds they undertake in line
with that view, their intentions, aims, wishes, and choices all lead to
what is unlikable, undesirable, disagreeable, harmful, and suffering.
Why is that? Because their view is bad."

315\. "Mendicants, when an individual has right view, whatever bodily, verbal,
or mental deeds they undertake in line with that view, their intentions,
aims, wishes, and choices all lead to what is likable, desirable,
agreeable, beneficial, and pleasant. Why is that? Because their view is
good. Suppose a seed of sugar cane, fine rice, or grape was planted in
moist earth. Whatever nutrients it takes up from the earth and water
would lead to its sweet, pleasant, and delicious taste. Why is that?
Because the seed is good. In the same way, when an individual has right
view, whatever bodily, verbal, or mental deeds they undertake in line
with that view, their intentions, aims, wishes, and choices all lead to
what is likable, desirable, agreeable, beneficial, and pleasant. Why is
that? Because their view is good."
