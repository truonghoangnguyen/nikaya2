# The Great Chapter

### AN 6.55 With Soṇa  *Soṇasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, on the Vulture's Peak Mountain.

Now at that time Venerable Soṇa was staying near
Rājagaha in the Cool Grove. Then as he was in private
retreat this thought came to his mind, "I am one of the Buddha's most
energetic disciples. Yet my mind is not freed from defilements by not
grasping. But my family has wealth. I could enjoy that wealth and make
merit. Why don't I resign the training and return to a lesser life, so I
can enjoy my wealth and make merit?"

Then the Buddha knew what Venerable Soṇa was thinking. As
easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he
vanished from the Vulture's Peak and reappeared in the Cool Grove in
front of Soṇa, and sat on the seat spread out.
Soṇa bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.

The Buddha said to him, "Soṇa, as you were in private
retreat didn't this thought come to your mind: 'I am one of the Buddha's
most energetic disciples. Yet my mind is not freed from defilements by
not grasping. But my family has wealth. I could enjoy that wealth and
make merit. Why don't I resign the training and return to a lesser life,
so I can enjoy my wealth and make merit?'"

"Yes, sir."

"What do you think, Soṇa? When you were still a layman,
weren't you a good player of the arched harp?"

"Yes, sir."

"When your harp's strings were tuned too tight, was it resonant and
playable?"

"No, sir."

"When your harp's strings were tuned too slack, was it resonant and
playable?"

"No, sir."

"But when your harp's strings were tuned neither too tight nor too
slack, but fixed at an even tension, was it resonant and playable?"

"Yes, sir."

"In the same way, Soṇa, when energy is too forceful it
leads to restlessness. When energy is too slack it leads to laziness.
So, Soṇa, you should focus on energy and serenity, find a
balance of the faculties, and learn the pattern of this situation."

"Yes, sir," Soṇa replied.

After advising Soṇa like this, the Buddha, as easily as a
strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Cool
Grove and reappeared on the Vulture's Peak.

After some time Soṇa focused on energy and serenity, found
a balance of the faculties, and learned the pattern of this situation.
Then Soṇa, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and
resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in
this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal
for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.

He understood: "Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been
completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further
for this place." And Venerable Soṇa became one of the
perfected.

Then, when Soṇa had attained perfection, he thought, "Why
don't I go to the Buddha and declare my enlightenment in his presence?"
Then Soṇa went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to him:

"Sir, a mendicant who is perfected---with defilements ended, who has
completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the
burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetter of
continued existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment---is
dedicated to six things. They are dedicated to renunciation, seclusion,
kindness, the ending of craving, the ending of grasping, and mental
clarity.

It may be, sir, that one of the venerables here thinks: 'Maybe this
venerable is dedicated to renunciation solely out of mere faith.' But it
should not be seen like this. A mendicant with defilements ended does
not see in themselves anything more to do, or anything that needs
improvement. They're dedicated to renunciation because they're free of
greed, hate, and delusion with the end of greed, hate, and delusion.

It may be, sir, that one of the venerables here thinks: 'Maybe this
venerable is dedicated to seclusion because they enjoy possessions,
honor, and popularity.' But it should not be seen like this. ...

It may be, sir, that one of the venerables here thinks: 'Maybe this
venerable is dedicated to kindness because they believe that adhering to
precepts and observances is essential.' But it should not be seen like
this. ...

They're dedicated to the ending of craving because they're free of
greed, hate, and delusion with the end of greed, hate, and delusion.

They're dedicated to the ending of grasping because they're free of
greed, hate, and delusion with the end of greed, hate, and delusion.

They're dedicated to clarity of mind because they're free of greed,
hate, and delusion with the end of greed, hate, and delusion.

When a mendicant's mind is rightly freed like this, even if compelling
sights come into the range of vision they don't overcome their mind. The
mind remains untainted. It is steady, imperturbable, observing
disappearance. Even if compelling sounds ... smells ... tastes ...
touches ... and ideas come into the range of the mind they don't
overcome the mind. The mind remains untainted. It is steady,
imperturbable, observing disappearance.

Suppose there was a mountain that was one solid mass of rock, without
cracks or holes. Even if violent storms were to blow up out of the east,
the west, the north, and the south, they couldn't make it shake or rock
or tremble.

In the same way, when a mendicant's mind is rightly freed like this,
even if compelling sights come into the range of vision they don't
overcome their mind. ... The mind remains untainted. It is steady,
imperturbable, observing disappearance.

> When you're dedicated to renunciation\
> and seclusion of the heart;\
> when you're dedicated to kindness\
> and the end of grasping;
>
> when you're dedicated to the ending of craving\
> and clarity of heart;\
> and you've seen the arising of the senses,\
> your mind is rightly freed.
>
> For that one, rightly freed,\
> a mendicant with peaceful mind,\
> there's nothing to be improved,\
> and nothing more to do.
>
> As the wind cannot stir\
> a solid mass of rock,\
> so too sights, tastes, sounds,\
> smells, and touches---the lot---
>
> and ideas, whether liked or disliked,\
> don't disturb the unaffected one.\
> Their mind is steady and free\
> as they observe disappearance."

### AN 6.56 With Phagguna  *Phaggunasutta*

Now at that time Venerable Phagguna was sick, suffering, gravely ill.
Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and said to him:

"Sir, Venerable Phagguna is sick. Sir, please go to Venerable Phagguna
out of sympathy." The Buddha consented with silence.

Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to
Venerable Phagguna. Venerable Phagguna saw the Buddha coming off in the
distance and tried to rise on his cot.

The Buddha said to him, "It's all right, Phagguna, don't get up. There
are some seats spread out by others, I will sit there."

He sat on the seat spread out and said to Venerable Phagguna: "I hope
you're keeping well, Phagguna; I hope you're all right. And I hope the
pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its
growing."

"Sir, I'm not keeping well, I'm not getting by. The pain is terrible and
growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.

The winds piercing my head are so severe, it feels like a strong man
drilling into my head with a sharp point. I'm not keeping well.

The pain in my head is so severe, it feels like a strong man tightening
a tough leather strap around my head. I'm not keeping well.

The winds slicing my belly are so severe, like a deft butcher or their
apprentice were slicing open a cows's belly with a sharp meat cleaver.
I'm not keeping well.

The burning in my body is so severe, it feels like two strong men
grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of
glowing coals. I'm not keeping well, I'm not getting by. The pain is
terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its
fading."

Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Venerable
Phagguna with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and
left.

Not long after the Buddha left, Venerable Phagguna passed away. At the
time of his death, his faculties were bright and clear. Then Venerable
Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to
him, "Sir, soon after the Buddha left, Venerable Phagguna died. At the
time of his death, his faculties were bright and clear."

"And why shouldn't his faculties be bright and clear? The mendicant
Phagguna's mind was not freed from the five lower fetters. But when he
heard that teaching his mind was freed from them.

Ānanda, there are these six benefits to hearing the teaching at the
right time and examining the meaning at the right time. What six?

Firstly, take the case of a mendicant whose mind is not freed from the
five lower fetters. At the time of death they get to see the Realized
One. The Realized One proclaims a teaching to them that is good in the
beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and
well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that's entirely full
and pure. When they hear that teaching their mind is freed from the five
lower fetters. This is the first benefit of listening to the teaching.

Next, take the case of another mendicant whose mind is not freed from
the five lower fetters. At the time of death they don't get to see the
Realized One, but they get to see a Realized One's disciple. The
Realized One's disciple teaches them Dhamma ... When they hear that
teaching their mind is freed from the five lower fetters. This is the
second benefit of listening to the teaching.

Next, take the case of another mendicant whose mind is not freed from
the five lower fetters. At the time of death they don't get to see the
Realized One, or to see a Realized One's disciple. But they think about
and consider the teaching in their heart, examining it with the mind as
they learned and memorized it. As they do so their mind is freed from
the five lower fetters. This is the third benefit of listening to the
teaching.

Next, take the case of a mendicant whose mind is freed from the five
lower fetters, but not with the supreme ending of attachments. At the
time of death they get to see the Realized One. The Realized One teaches
them Dhamma ... When they hear that teaching their mind is freed with
the supreme ending of attachments. This is the fourth benefit of
listening to the teaching.

Next, take the case of another mendicant whose mind is freed from the
five lower fetters, but not with the supreme ending of attachments. At
the time of death they don't get to see the Realized One, but they get
to see a Realized One's disciple. The Realized One's disciple teaches
them Dhamma ... When they hear that teaching their mind is freed with
the supreme ending of attachments. This is the fifth benefit of
listening to the teaching.

Next, take the case of another mendicant whose mind is freed from the
five lower fetters, but not with the supreme ending of attachments. At
the time of death they don't get to see the Realized One, or to see a
Realized One's disciple. But they think about and consider the teaching
in their heart, examining it with the mind as they learned and memorized
it. As they do so their mind is freed with the supreme ending of
attachments. This is the sixth benefit of listening to the teaching.

These are the six benefits to hearing the teaching at the right time and
examining the meaning at the right time."

### AN 6.57 The Six Classes of Rebirth  *Chaḷabhijātisutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the
Vulture's Peak Mountain. Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha,
bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, Pūraṇa Kassapa describes six classes of rebirth:
black, blue, red, yellow, white, and ultimate white.

The black class of rebirth consists of slaughterers of sheep, pigs,
poultry, or deer, hunters or fishers, bandits, executioners, butchers of
cattle, jailers, and any others with a cruel livelihood.

The blue class of rebirth consists of mendicants whose life is thorny,
and any others who teach the efficacy of deeds and action.

The red class of rebirth consists of the Jain ascetics who wear one
cloth.

The yellow class of rebirth consists of the lay people dressed in white
who are disciples of the naked ascetics.

The white class of rebirth consists of male and female
Ājīvaka ascetics.

And the ultimate white class of rebirth consists of Nanda Vaccha, Kisa
Saṅkicca, and the bamboo-staffed ascetic
Gosāla.

These are the six classes of rebirth that Pūraṇa Kassapa
describes."

"But Ānanda, did the whole world authorize Pūraṇa Kassapa
to describe these six classes of rebirth?"

"No, sir."

"It's as if they were to force a chop on a poor, penniless person,
telling them, 'Eat this meat and pay for it!' In the same way,
Pūraṇa Kassapa has described these six classes of rebirth
without the consent of those ascetics and brahmins. And he has done so
in a foolish, incompetent, unskilled way, lacking common sense.

I, however, also describe six classes of rebirth. Listen and apply your
mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," Ānanda replied. The Buddha said this:

"And what, Ānanda, are the six classes of rebirth? Someone born into a
dark class gives rise to a dark result. Someone born into a dark class
gives rise to a bright result. Someone born into a dark class gives rise
to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright. Someone born into a
bright class gives rise to a dark result. Someone born into a bright
class gives rise to a bright result. Someone born into a bright class
gives rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright.

And how does someone born into a dark class give rise to a dark result?
It's when someone is reborn in a low family---a family of
corpse-workers, bamboo-workers, hunters, chariot-makers, or
scavengers---poor, with little to eat or drink, where life is tough, and
food and shelter are hard to find. And they're ugly, unsightly,
deformed, sickly---one-eyed, crippled, lame, or half-paralyzed. They
don't get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands,
fragrance, and makeup; or bed, house, and lighting. And they do bad
things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body breaks up,
after death, they're reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the
underworld, hell. That's how someone born into a dark class gives rise
to a dark result.

And how does someone born into a dark class give rise to a bright
result? It's when some person is reborn in a low family ... But they do
good things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body breaks up,
after death, they're reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. That's
how someone born into a dark class gives rise to a bright result.

And how does someone born into a dark class give rise to extinguishment,
which is neither dark nor bright? It's when some person is reborn in a
low family ... They shave off their hair and beard, dress in ocher
robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. They give up the
five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. They
firmly establish their mind in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.
They truly develop the seven awakening factors. And then they give rise
to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright. That's how someone
born in a dark class gives rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark
nor bright.

And how does someone born into a bright class give rise to a dark
result? It's when some person is reborn in an eminent family---a
well-to-do family of aristocrats, brahmins, or householders---rich,
affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property
and assets, and lots of money and grain. And they're attractive,
good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. They get to have food,
drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed,
house, and lighting. But they do bad things by way of body, speech, and
mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they're reborn in a place
of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. That's how someone born into
a bright class gives rise to a dark result.

And how does someone born into a bright class give rise to a bright
result? It's when some person is reborn in an eminent family ... And
they do good things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body
breaks up, after death, they're reborn in a good place, a heavenly
realm. That's how someone born into a bright class give rise to a bright
result.

And how does someone born into a bright class give rise to
extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright? It's when some person
is reborn in an eminent family ... They shave off their hair and beard,
dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
They give up the five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken
wisdom. They firmly establish their mind in the four kinds of
mindfulness meditation. They truly develop the seven awakening factors.
And then they give rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor
bright. That's how someone born into a bright class gives rise to
extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright.

These are the six classes of rebirth."

### AN 6.58 Defilements  *Āsavasutta*

"Mendicants, a mendicant with six qualities is worthy of offerings
dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious
donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme
field of merit for the world. What six?

It's a mendicant who, by restraint, has given up the defilements that
should be given up by restraint. By using, they've given up the
defilements that should be given up by using. By enduring, they've given
up the defilements that should be given up by enduring. By avoiding,
they've given up the defilements that should be given up by avoiding. By
getting rid, they've given up the defilements that should be given up by
getting rid. By developing, they've given up the defilements that should
be given up by developing.

And what are the defilements that should be given up by restraint? Take
a mendicant who, reflecting rationally, lives restraining the eye
faculty. For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise
in someone who lives without restraint of the eye faculty do not arise
when there is such restraint. Reflecting rationally, they live
restraining the ear faculty ... the nose faculty ... the tongue faculty
... the body faculty ... the mind faculty. For the distressing and
feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without
restraint of the mind faculty do not arise when there is such restraint.
These are called the defilements that should be given up by restraint.

And what are the defilements that should be given up by using? Take a
mendicant who, reflecting rationally, makes use of robes: 'Only for the
sake of warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies,
mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; and for covering up the private
parts.' Reflecting rationally, they make use of almsfood: 'Not for fun,
indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to
avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put
an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will
have the means to keep going, blamelessness, and a comfortable abiding.'
Reflecting rationally, they make use of lodgings: 'Only for the sake of
warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies,
mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; to shelter from harsh weather and
to enjoy retreat.' Reflecting rationally, they make use of medicines and
supplies for the sick: 'Only for the sake of warding off the pains of
illness and to promote good health.' For the distressing and feverish
defilements that might arise in someone who lives without using these
things do not arise when they are used. These are called the defilements
that should be given up by using.

And what are the defilements that should be given up by enduring? Take a
mendicant who, reflecting rationally, endures cold, heat, hunger, and
thirst. They endure the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and
reptiles. They endure rude and unwelcome criticism. And they put up with
physical pain---sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, and
life-threatening. For the distressing and feverish defilements that
might arise in someone who lives without enduring these things do not
arise when they are endured. These are called the defilements that
should be given up by enduring.

And what are the defilements that should be given up by avoiding? Take a
mendicant who, reflecting rationally, avoids a wild elephant, a wild
horse, a wild ox, a wild dog, a snake, a stump, thorny ground, a pit, a
cliff, a swamp, and a sewer. Reflecting rationally, they avoid sitting
on inappropriate seats, walking in inappropriate neighborhoods, and
mixing with bad friends---whatever sensible spiritual companions would
believe to be a bad setting. For the distressing and feverish
defilements that might arise in someone who lives without avoiding these
things do not arise when they are avoided. These are called the
defilements that should be given up by avoiding.

And what are the defilements that should be given up by getting rid?
Take a mendicant who, reflecting rationally, doesn't tolerate a sensual,
malicious, or cruel thought that has arisen. They don't tolerate any
bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give them up, get rid of
them, eliminate them, and obliterate them. For the distressing and
feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without
getting rid of these things do not arise when they are gotten rid of.
These are called the defilements that should be given up by getting rid.

And what are the defilements that should be given up by developing? Take
a mendicant who, reflecting rationally, develops the awakening factors
of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture,
tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading
away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. For the distressing and
feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without
developing these things do not arise when they are developed. These are
called the defilements that should be given up by developing.

A mendicant with these six qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to
the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy
of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for
the world."

### AN 6.59 With Dārukammika  *Dārukammikasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying at
Ñātika in the brick house.

Then the householder Dārukammika went up to the Buddha,
bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, "Householder, I
wonder whether your family gives gifts?"

"It does, sir. Gifts are given to those mendicants who are perfected or
on the path to perfection; they live in the wilderness, eat only
almsfood, and wear rag robes."

"Householder, as a layman enjoying sensual pleasures, living at home
with your children, using sandalwood imported from Kāsi,
wearing garlands, fragrance, and makeup, and accepting gold and
currency, it's hard for you to know who is perfected or on the path to
perfection.

If a mendicant living in the wilderness is restless, insolent, fickle,
scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and
immersion, with straying mind and undisciplined faculties, then in this
respect they're reprehensible. If a mendicant living in the wilderness
is not restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, or loose-tongued, but has
established mindfulness, situational awareness and immersion, with
unified mind and restrained faculties, then in this respect they're
praiseworthy.

If a mendicant who lives within a village is restless ... then in this
respect they're reprehensible. If a mendicant who lives within a village
is not restless ... then in this respect they're praiseworthy.

If a mendicant who eats only almsfood is restless ... then in this
respect they're reprehensible. If a mendicant who eats only almsfood is
not restless ... then in this respect they're praiseworthy.

If a mendicant who accepts invitations is restless ... then in this
respect they're reprehensible. If a mendicant who accepts invitations is
not restless ... then in this respect they're praiseworthy.

If a mendicant who wears rag robes is restless ... then in this respect
they're reprehensible. If a mendicant who wears rag robes is not
restless ... then in this respect they're praiseworthy.

If a mendicant who wears robes offered by householders is restless,
insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking
situational awareness and immersion, with straying mind and
undisciplined faculties, then in this respect they're reprehensible. If
a mendicant who wears robes offered by householders is not restless,
insolent, fickle, scurrilous, or loose-tongued, but has established
mindfulness, situational awareness and immersion, with unified mind and
restrained faculties, then in this respect they're praiseworthy.

Go ahead, householder, give gifts to the Saṅgha. Your mind
will become bright and clear, and when your body breaks up, after death,
you'll be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm."

"Sir, from this day forth I will give gifts to the Saṅgha."

### AN 6.60 With Hatthisāriputta  *Hatthisāriputtasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana.

Now at that time several senior mendicants, after the meal, on their
return from almsround, sat together in the pavilion talking about the
teachings. Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta interrupted them
while they were talking.

Then Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita said to Venerable Citta
Hatthisāriputta, "Venerable, please don't interrupt the
senior mendicants while they're talking about the teachings. Wait until
the end of the discussion."

When he said this, Citta Hatthisāriputta's companions said
to Mahākoṭṭhita, "Venerable, please don't rebuke Citta
Hatthisāriputta. He is astute, and quite capable of talking
about the teachings with the senior mendicants."

"It's not easy to know this, reverends, for those who don't comprehend
another's mind.

Take a person who is the sweetest of the sweet, the most even-tempered
of the even-tempered, the calmest of the calm, so long as they live
relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher's role. But
when they're separated from the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a
teacher's role, they mix closely with monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen;
with rulers and their chief ministers, and with monastics of other
religions and their disciples. As they mix closely, they become intimate
and loose, spending time chatting, and so lust infects their mind. They
resign the training and return to a lesser life.

Suppose an ox fond of crops was tied up or shut in a pen. Would it be
right to say that that ox will never again invade the crops?"

"No it would not, reverend. For it's quite possible that that ox will
snap the ropes or break out of the pen, and then invade the crops."

"In the same way, take a person who is the sweetest of the sweet ... As
they mix closely, they become intimate and loose, spending time
chatting, and so lust infects their mind. They resign the training and
return to a lesser life.

And take a person who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures ... enters
and remains in the first absorption. Thinking, 'I get the first
absorption!' they mix closely with monks ... They resign the training
and return to a lesser life.

Suppose the heavens were raining heavily at the crossroads so that the
dust vanished and mud appeared. Would it be right to say that now dust
will never appear at this crossroad again?"

"No it would not, reverend. For it is quite possible that people or
cattle and so on will cross over the crossroad, or that the wind and sun
will evaporate the moisture so that the dust appears again."

"In the same way, take a person who, quite secluded from sensual
pleasures ... enters and remains in the first absorption. Thinking, 'I
get the first absorption!' they mix closely with monks ... They resign
the training and return to a lesser life.

And take a person who, as the placing of the mind and keeping it
connected are stilled ... enters and remains in the second absorption.
Thinking, 'I get the second absorption!' they mix closely with monks ...
They resign the training and return to a lesser life.

Suppose there was a large pond not far from a town or village. After the
heavens have rained heavily there, the clams and mussels, and pebbles
and gravel would vanish. Would it be right to say that now the clams and
mussels, and pebbles and gravel will never appear here again?"

"No it would not, reverend. For it's quite possible that people or
cattle and so on will drink from the pond, or that the wind and sun will
evaporate it so that the clams and mussels, and pebbles and gravel
appear again."

"In the same way, take a person who, as the placing of the mind and
keeping it connected are stilled ... enters and remains in the second
absorption. Thinking, 'I get the second absorption!' they mix closely
with monks ... They resign the training and return to a lesser life.

And take a person who, with the fading away of rapture ... enters and
remains in the third absorption. Thinking, 'I get the third absorption!'
they mix closely with monks ... They resign the training and return to a
lesser life.

Suppose a person had finished a delicious meal. They'd have no appetite
for leftovers. Would it be right to say that now food will never appeal
to this person again?"

"No it would not, reverend. For it's quite possible that other food
won't appeal to that person as long as the nourishment is still present.
But when the nourishment vanishes food will appeal again."

"In the same way, take a person who, with the fading away of rapture ...
enters and remains in the third absorption. Thinking, 'I get the third
absorption!' they mix closely with monks ... They resign the training
and return to a lesser life.

And take a person who, giving up pleasure and pain ... enters and
remains in the fourth absorption. Thinking, 'I get the fourth
absorption!' they mix closely with monks ... They resign the training
and return to a lesser life.

Suppose that in a mountain glen there was a lake, unruffled and free of
waves. Would it be right to say that now waves will never appear in this
lake again?"

"No it would not, reverend. For it is quite possible that a violent
storm could blow up out of the east, west, north, or south, and stir up
waves in that lake."

"In the same way, take a person who, giving up pleasure and pain ...
enters and remains in the fourth absorption. Thinking, 'I get the fourth
absorption!' they mix closely with monks ... They resign the training
and return to a lesser life.

And take a person who, not focusing on any signs, enters and remains in
the signless immersion of the heart. Thinking, 'I get the signless
immersion of the heart!' they mix closely with monks, nuns, laymen, and
laywomen; with rulers and their chief ministers, and with monastics of
other religions and their disciples. As they mix closely, they become
intimate and loose, spending time chatting, and so lust infects their
mind. They resign the training and return to a lesser life.

Suppose a ruler or their chief minister, while walking along the road
with an army of four divisions, was to arrive at a forest grove where
they set up camp for the night. There, because of the noise of the
elephants, horses, chariots, soldiers, and the drums, kettledrums,
horns, and cymbals, the chirping of crickets would vanish. Would it be
right to say that now the chirping of crickets will never be heard in
this woodland grove again?"

"No it would not, reverend. For it is quite possible that the ruler or
their chief minister will depart from that woodland grove so that the
chirping of crickets will be heard there again."

"In the same way, take a person who, not focusing on any signs, enters
and remains in the signless immersion of the heart ... They resign the
training and return to a lesser life."

Then after some time Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta
resigned the training and returned to a lesser life. Then the mendicants
who were his companions went up to Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita
and said, "Did Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita comprehend Citta
Hatthisāriputta's mind and know that he had gained such and
such meditative attainments, yet he would still resign the training and
return to a lesser life? Or did deities tell you about it?"

"Reverends, I comprehended his mind and knew this. And deities also told
me."

Then the mendicants who were Citta Hatthisāriputta's
companions went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said
to him, "Sir, Citta Hatthisāriputta, who had gained such
and such meditative attainments, has still resigned the training and
returned to a lesser life."

"Mendicants, soon Citta will remember renunciation."

And not long after Citta Hatthisāriputta shaved off his
hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life
to homelessness. Then Citta Hatthisāriputta, living alone,
withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme
culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having
achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go
forth from the lay life to homelessness.

He understood: "Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been
completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further
for this place." And Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta became
one of the perfected.

### AN 6.61 In the Middle  *Majjhesutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana.

Now at that time, after the meal, on return from almsround, several
senior mendicants sat together in the pavilion and this discussion came
up among them, "Reverends, this was said by the Buddha in 'The Way to
the Far Shore', in 'The Questions of Metteyya':

> 'The thoughtful one who has known both ends,\
> and is not stuck in the middle:\
> he is a great man, I declare,\
> he has escaped the seamstress here.'

But what is one end? What's the second end? What's the middle? And who
is the seamstress?" When this was said, one of the mendicants said to
the senior mendicants:

"Contact, reverends, is one end. The origin of contact is the second
end. The cessation of contact is the middle. And craving is the
seamstress, for craving weaves one to being reborn in one state of
existence or another. That's how a mendicant directly knows what should
be directly known and completely understands what should be completely
understood. Knowing and understanding thus they make an end of suffering
in this very life."

When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:

"The past, reverends, is one end. The future is the second end. The
present is the middle. And craving is the seamstress ... That's how a
mendicant directly knows ... an end of suffering in this very life."

When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:

"Pleasant feeling, reverends, is one end. Painful feeling is the second
end. Neutral feeling is the middle. And craving is the seamstress ...
That's how a mendicant directly knows ... an end of suffering in this
very life."

When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:

"Name, reverends, is one end. Form is the second end. Consciousness is
the middle. And craving is the seamstress ... That's how a mendicant
directly knows ... an end of suffering in this very life."

When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:

"The six interior sense fields, reverends, are one end. The six exterior
sense fields are the second end. Consciousness is the middle. And
craving is the seamstress ... That's how a mendicant directly knows ...
an end of suffering in this very life."

When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:

"Substantial reality, reverends, is one end. The origin of substantial
reality is the second end. The cessation of substantial reality is the
middle. And craving is the seamstress, for craving weaves one to being
reborn in one state of existence or another. That's how a mendicant
directly knows what should be directly known and completely understands
what should be completely understood. Knowing and understanding thus
they make an end of suffering in this very life."

When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:

"Each of us has spoken from the heart. Come, reverends, let's go to the
Buddha, and inform him about this. As he answers, so we'll remember it."

"Yes, reverend," those senior mendicants replied. Then those senior
mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and
informed the Buddha of all they had discussed. They asked, "Sir, who has
spoken well?"

"Mendicants, you've all spoken well in a way. However, this is what I
was referring to in 'The Way to the Far Shore', in 'The Questions of
Metteyya' when I said:

> 'The sage has known both ends,\
> and is not stuck in the middle.\
> He is a great man, I declare,\
> he has escaped the seamstress here.'

Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Contact, mendicants, is one end. The origin of contact is the second
end. The cessation of contact is the middle. And craving is the
seamstress, for craving weaves one to being reborn in one state of
existence or another. That's how a mendicant directly knows what should
be directly known and completely understands what should be completely
understood. Knowing and understanding thus they make an end of suffering
in this very life."

### AN 6.62 Knowledge of the Faculties of Persons  *Purisindriyañāṇasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was wandering in
the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of
mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Kosalans named
Daṇḍakappaka. The Buddha left the road and sat at the root
of a tree on the seat spread out. The mendicants entered
Daṇḍakappaka to look for a guest house.

Then Venerable Ānanda together with several mendicants went to the
Aciravatī River to bathe. When he had bathed and emerged
from the water he stood in one robe drying his limbs.

Then a certain mendicant went up to Venerable Ānanda, and said to him,
"Reverend Ānanda, when the Buddha declared that Devadatta was going to a
place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable, did he
do so after wholeheartedly deliberating, or was this just a way of
speaking?"

"You're right, reverend, that's how the Buddha declared it."

Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one
side, and told him what had happened.

"Ānanda, that mendicant must be junior, recently gone forth, or else a
foolish, incompetent senior mendicant. How on earth can he take
something that I have declared categorically to be ambiguous? I do not
see a single other person about whom I have given such whole-hearted
deliberation before making a declaration as I did in the case of
Devadatta.

As long as I saw even a fraction of a hair's tip of goodness in
Devadatta I did not declare that he was going to a place of loss, to
hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable. But when I saw that
there was not even a fraction of a hair's tip of goodness in Devadatta I
declared that he was going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain
for an eon, irredeemable.

Suppose there was a sewer deeper than a man's height, full to the brim
with feces, and someone was sunk into it over their head. Then along
comes a person who wants to help make them safe, who wants to lift them
out of that sewer. But circling all around the sewer they couldn't see
even a fraction of a hair's tip of that person that was not smeared with
feces.

In the same way, when I saw that there was not even a fraction of a
hair's tip of goodness in Devadatta I declared that he was going to a
place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable. If you
would all listen, Ānanda, I will analyze the Realized One's knowledges
of the faculties of persons."

"Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! Let the Buddha
analyze the faculties of persons. The mendicants will listen and
remember it."

"Well then, Ānanda, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," Ānanda replied. The Buddha said this:

"Ānanda, when I've comprehended the mind of a person, I understand:
'Both skillful and unskillful qualities are found in this person.' After
some time I comprehend their mind and understand: 'The skillful
qualities of this person have vanished, but the unskillful qualities are
still present. Nevertheless, their skillful root is unbroken, and from
that the skillful will appear. So this person is not liable to decline
in the future.' Suppose some seeds were intact, unspoiled, not
weather-damaged, fertile, and well-kept. They're sown in a
well-prepared, productive field. Wouldn't you know that those seeds
would grow, increase, and mature?"

"Yes, sir."

"In the same way, when I've comprehended the mind of a person, I
understand ... This person is not liable to decline in the future ...
This is how another individual is known to the Realized One by
comprehending their mind. And this is how the Realized One knows a
person's faculties by comprehending their mind. And this is how the
Realized One knows the future origination of a person's qualities by
comprehending their mind.

When I've comprehended the mind of a person, I understand: 'Both
skillful and unskillful qualities are found in this person.' After some
time I comprehend their mind and understand: 'The unskillful qualities
of this person have vanished, but the skillful qualities are still
present. Nevertheless, their unskillful root is unbroken, and from that
the unskillful will appear. So this person is still liable to decline in
the future.' Suppose some seeds were intact, unspoiled, not
weather-damaged, fertile, and well-kept. And they were sown on a broad
rock. Wouldn't you know that those seeds would not grow, increase, and
mature?"

"Yes, sir."

"In the same way, when I've comprehended the mind of a person, I
understand ... This person is still liable to decline in the future ...
This is how another individual is known to the Realized One ...

When I've comprehended the mind of a person, I understand: 'Both
skillful and unskillful qualities are found in this person.' After some
time I comprehend their mind and understand: 'This person has not even a
fraction of a hair's tip of goodness. They have exclusively dark,
unskillful qualities. When their body breaks up, after death, they will
be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.'
Suppose some seeds were broken, spoiled, weather-damaged. They're sown
in a well-prepared, productive field. Wouldn't you know that those seeds
would not grow, increase, and mature?"

"Yes, sir."

"In the same way, when I've comprehended the mind of a person, I
understand ... 'This person has not even a fraction of a hair's tip of
goodness. They have exclusively dark, unskillful qualities. When their
body breaks up, after death, they will be reborn in a place of loss, a
bad place, the underworld, hell.' ..."

When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, "Sir, can you
describe three other persons who are counterparts of these three?"

"I can, Ānanda," said the Buddha. "Ānanda, when I've comprehended the
mind of a person, I understand: 'Both skillful and unskillful qualities
are found in this person.' After some time I comprehend their mind and
understand: 'The skillful qualities of this person have vanished, but
the unskillful qualities are still present. Nevertheless, their skillful
root is unbroken, but it's about to be totally destroyed. So this person
is still liable to decline in the future.' Suppose that there were some
burning coals, blazing and glowing. And they were placed on a broad
rock. Wouldn't you know that those coals would not grow, increase, and
spread?"

"Yes, sir."

"Or suppose it was the late afternoon and the sun was going down.
Wouldn't you know that the light was about to vanish and darkness
appear?"

"Yes, sir."

"Or suppose that it's nearly time for the midnight meal. Wouldn't you
know that the light had vanished and the darkness appeared?"

"Yes, sir."

"In the same way, when I've comprehended the mind of a person, I
understand ... This person is still liable to decline in the future ...

When I've comprehended the mind of a person, I understand: 'Both
skillful and unskillful qualities are found in this person.' After some
time I comprehend their mind and understand: 'The unskillful qualities
of this person have vanished, but the skillful qualities are still
present. Nevertheless, their unskillful root is unbroken, but it's about
to be totally destroyed. So this person is not liable to decline in the
future.' Suppose that there were some burning coals, blazing and
glowing. They were placed on a pile of grass or timber. Wouldn't you
know that those coals would grow, increase, and spread?"

"Yes, sir."

"Suppose it's the crack of dawn and the sun is rising. Wouldn't you know
that the dark will vanish and the light appear?"

"Yes, sir."

"Or suppose that it's nearly time for the midday meal. Wouldn't you know
that the dark had vanished and the light appeared?"

"Yes, sir."

"In the same way, when I've comprehended the mind of a person, I
understand ... This person is not liable to decline in the future ...

When I've comprehended the mind of a person, I understand: 'Both
skillful and unskillful qualities are found in this person.' After some
time I comprehend their mind and understand: 'This person has not even a
fraction of a hair's tip of unskillful qualities. They have exclusively
bright, blameless qualities. They will become extinguished in this very
life.' Suppose that there were some cool, quenched coals. They were
placed on a pile of grass or timber. Wouldn't you know that those coals
would not grow, increase, and spread?"

"Yes, sir."

"In the same way, when I've comprehended the mind of a person, I
understand ... 'This person has not even a fraction of a hair's tip of
unskillful qualities. They have exclusively bright, blameless qualities.
They will become extinguished in this very life.' This is how another
individual is known to the Realized One by comprehending their mind. And
this is how the Realized One knows a person's faculties by comprehending
their mind. And this is how the Realized One knows the future
origination of a person's qualities by comprehending their mind.

And so, Ānanda, of the first three people one is not liable to decline,
one is liable to decline, and one is bound for a place of loss, hell.
And of the second three people, one is liable to decline, one is not
liable to decline, and one is bound to become extinguished."

### AN 6.63 Penetrative  *Nibbedhikasutta*

"Mendicants, I will teach you a penetrative exposition of the teaching.
Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, what is the penetrative exposition of the teaching? Sensual
pleasures should be known. And their source, diversity, result,
cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be
known.

Feelings should be known. And their source, diversity, result,
cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be
known.

Perceptions should be known. And their source, diversity, result,
cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be
known.

Defilements should be known. And their source, diversity, result,
cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be
known.

Deeds should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation,
and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.

Suffering should be known. And its source, diversity, result, cessation,
and the practice that leads to its cessation should be known.

'Sensual pleasures should be known. And their source, diversity, result,
cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be
known.' That's what I said, but why did I say it? There are these five
kinds of sensual stimulation. Sights known by the eye, which are
likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. Sounds
known by the ear ... Smells known by the nose ... Tastes known by the
tongue ... Touches known by the body, which are likable, desirable,
agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. However, these are not
sensual pleasures. In the training of the Noble One they're called
'kinds of sensual stimulation'.

> Greedy intention is a person's sensual pleasure.\
> The world's pretty things aren't sensual pleasures.\
> Greedy intention is a person's sensual pleasure.\
> The world's pretty things stay just as they are,\
> but the attentive remove desire for them.

And what is the source of sensual pleasures? Contact is their source.

And what is the diversity of sensual pleasures? The sensual desire for
sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches are all different. This is
called the diversity of sensual pleasures.

And what is the result of sensual pleasures? When one who desires
sensual pleasures creates a corresponding incarnation, partaking of
either good or bad deeds---this is called the result of sensual
pleasures.

And what is the cessation of sensual pleasures? When contact ceases,
sensual pleasures cease. The practice that leads to the cessation of
sensual pleasures is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right
view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right
effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.

When a noble disciple understands sensual pleasures in this way---and
understands their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice
that leads to their cessation---they understand that this penetrative
spiritual life is the cessation of sensual pleasures. 'Sensual pleasures
should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the
practice that leads to their cessation should be known.' That's what I
said, and this is why I said it.

'Feelings should be known. And their source, diversity, result,
cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be
known.' That's what I said, but why did I say it? There are these three
feelings: pleasant, painful, and neutral.

And what is the source of feelings? Contact is their source.

And what is the diversity of feelings? There are pleasant feelings of
the flesh, pleasant feelings not of the flesh, painful feelings of the
flesh, painful feelings not of the flesh, neutral feelings of the flesh,
and neutral feelings not of the flesh. This is called the diversity of
feelings.

And what is the result of feelings? When one who feels creates a
corresponding incarnation, partaking of either good or bad deeds---this
is called the result of feelings.

And what is the cessation of feelings? When contact ceases, feelings
cease. The practice that leads to the cessation of feelings is simply
this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right
speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,
and right immersion.

When a noble disciple understands feelings in this way ... they
understand that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of
feelings. 'Feelings should be known. And their source, diversity,
result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should
be known.' That's what I said, and this is why I said it.

'Perceptions should be known. And their source, diversity, result,
cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be
known.' That's what I said, but why did I say it? There are these six
perceptions: perceptions of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and
ideas.

And what is the source of perceptions? Contact is their source.

And what is the diversity of perceptions? The perceptions of sights,
sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and ideas are all different. This is
called the diversity of perceptions.

And what is the result of perceptions? Communication is the result of
perception, I say. You communicate something in whatever manner you
perceive it, saying 'That's what I perceived.' This is called the result
of perceptions.

And what is the cessation of perception? When contact ceases, perception
ceases. The practice that leads to the cessation of perceptions is
simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought,
right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right
mindfulness, and right immersion.

When a noble disciple understands perception in this way ... they
understand that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of
perception. 'Perceptions should be known. And their source, diversity,
result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should
be known.' That's what I said, and this is why I said it.

'Defilements should be known. And their source, diversity, result,
cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be
known.' That's what I said, but why did I say it? There are these three
defilements: the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and
ignorance.

And what is the source of defilements? Ignorance is the source of
defilements.

And what is the diversity of defilements? There are defilements that
lead to rebirth in hell, the animal realm, the ghost realm, the human
world, and the world of the gods. This is called the diversity of
defilements.

And what is the result of defilements? When one who is ignorant creates
a corresponding incarnation, partaking of either good or bad
deeds---this is called the result of defilements.

And what is the cessation of defilements? When ignorance ceases,
defilements cease. The practice that leads to the cessation of
defilements is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view,
right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right
effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.

When a noble disciple understands defilements in this way ... they
understand that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of
defilements. 'Defilements should be known. And their source, diversity,
result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should
be known.' That's what I said, and this is why I said it.

'Deeds should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation,
and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.' That's
what I said, but why did I say it? It is intention that I call deeds.
For after making a choice one acts by way of body, speech, and mind.

And what is the source of deeds? Contact is their source.

And what is the diversity of deeds? There are deeds that lead to rebirth
in hell, the animal realm, the ghost realm, the human world, and the
world of the gods. This is called the diversity of deeds.

And what is the result of deeds? The result of deeds is threefold, I
say: in this very life, on rebirth in the next life, or at some later
time. This is called the result of deeds.

And what is the cessation of deeds? When contact ceases, deeds cease.
The practice that leads to the cessation of deeds is simply this noble
eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right
action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right
immersion.

When a noble disciple understands deeds in this way ... they understand
that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of deeds. 'Deeds
should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the
practice that leads to their cessation should be known.' That's what I
said, and this is why I said it.

'Suffering should be known. And its source, diversity, result,
cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation should be
known.' That's what I said, but why did I say it? Rebirth is suffering;
old age is suffering; illness is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow,
lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are suffering; not getting what
you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are
suffering.

And what is the source of suffering? Craving is the source of suffering.

And what is the diversity of suffering? There is suffering that is
severe, mild, slow to fade, and quick to fade. This is called the
diversity of suffering.

And what is the result of suffering? It's when someone who is overcome
and overwhelmed by suffering sorrows and wails and laments, beating
their breast and falling into confusion. Or else, overcome by that
suffering, they begin an external search, wondering: 'Who knows one or
two phrases to stop this suffering?' The result of suffering is either
confusion or a search, I say. This is called the result of suffering.

And what is the cessation of suffering? When craving ceases, suffering
ceases. The practice that leads to the cessation of suffering is simply
this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right
speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,
and right immersion.

When a noble disciple understands suffering in this way ... they
understand that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of
suffering. 'Suffering should be known. And its source, diversity,
result, cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation should
be known.' That's what I said, and this is why I said it.

This is the penetrative exposition of the teaching."

### AN 6.64 The Lion's Roar  *Sīhanādasutta*

"Mendicants, the Realized One possesses six powers of a Realized One.
With these he claims the bull's place, roars his lion's roar in the
assemblies, and turns the divine wheel. What six?

Firstly, the Realized One truly understands the possible as possible and
the impossible as impossible. Since he truly understands this, this is a
power of the Realized One. Relying on this he claims the bull's place,
roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel.

Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the result of deeds
undertaken in the past, future, and present in terms of grounds and
causes. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized
One. ...

Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands corruption, cleansing,
and emergence regarding the absorptions, liberations, immersions, and
attainments. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the
Realized One. ...

Furthermore, the Realized One recollects many kinds of past lives. That
is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a
hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world
contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world
contracting and expanding. He remembers: 'There, I was named this, my
clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I
felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed
away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was
named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food.
This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended.
When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.' And so he
recollects his many kinds of past lives, with features and details.
Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One.
...

Furthermore, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the
Realized One sees sentient beings passing away and being
reborn---inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a
bad place. He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to
their deeds. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the
Realized One. ...

Furthermore, the Realized One has realized the undefiled freedom of
heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And he lives having
realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements. Since
he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. Relying
on this he claims the bull's place, roars his lion's roar in the
assemblies, and turns the divine wheel. These are the six powers of a
Realized One that the Realized One possesses. With these he claims the
bull's place, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and turns the
divine wheel.

If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true
knowledge of the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible,
the Realized One answers them in whatever manner he has truly known it.

If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true
knowledge of the result of deeds undertaken in the past, future, and
present in terms of grounds and causes, the Realized One answers them in
whatever manner he has truly known it.

If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true
knowledge of corruption, cleansing, and emergence regarding the
absorptions, liberations, immersions, and attainments, the Realized One
answers them in whatever manner he has truly known it.

If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true
knowledge of recollection of past lives, the Realized One answers them
in whatever manner he has truly known it.

If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true
knowledge of passing away and rebirth of sentient beings, the Realized
One answers them in whatever manner he has truly known it.

If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true
knowledge of the ending of defilements, the Realized One answers them in
whatever manner he has truly known it.

And I say that true knowledge of the possible as possible and the
impossible as impossible is for those with immersion, not for those
without immersion. And true knowledge of the result of deeds undertaken
in the past, future, and present in terms of grounds and causes is for
those with immersion, not for those without immersion. And true
knowledge of corruption, cleansing, and emergence regarding the
absorptions, liberations, immersions, and attainments is for those with
immersion, not for those without immersion. And true knowledge of the
recollection of past lives is for those with immersion, not for those
without immersion. And true knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of
sentient beings is for those with immersion, not for those without
immersion. And true knowledge of the ending of defilements is for those
with immersion, not for those without immersion.

And so, mendicants, immersion is the path. No immersion is the wrong
path."
