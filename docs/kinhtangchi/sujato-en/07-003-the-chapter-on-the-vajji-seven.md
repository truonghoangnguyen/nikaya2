# The Chapter on the Vajji Seven

### AN 7.21 At Sārandada  *Sārandadasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Vesālī, at the Sārandada Tree-shrine. Then
several Licchavis went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,
and the Buddha said to these Licchavis:

"Licchavis, I will teach you these seven principles that prevent
decline. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"And what are the seven principles that prevent decline? As long as the
Vajjis meet frequently and have many meetings, they can expect growth,
not decline.

As long as the Vajjis meet in harmony, leave in harmony, and carry on
their business in harmony, they can expect growth, not decline.

As long as the Vajjis don't make new decrees or abolish existing
decrees, but undertake and follow the ancient Vajjian traditions as they
have been decreed, they can expect growth, not decline.

As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate Vajjian
elders, and think them worth listening to, they can expect growth, not
decline.

As long as the Vajjis don't forcibly abduct the women or girls of the
clans and make them live with them, they can expect growth, not decline.

As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Vajjian
shrines, whether inner or outer, not neglecting the proper
spirit-offerings that were given and made in the past, they can expect
growth, not decline.

As long as the Vajjis organize proper protection, shelter, and security
for perfected ones, so that more perfected ones might come to the realm
and those already here may live in comfort, they can expect growth, not
decline.

As long as these seven principles that prevent decline last among the
Vajjis, and as long as the Vajjis are seen following them, they can
expect growth, not decline."

### AN 7.22 With Vassakāra  *Vassakārasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, on the Vulture's Peak Mountain.

Now at that time King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the
princess of Videha, wanted to invade the Vajjis. He declared: "I shall
wipe out these Vajjis, so mighty and powerful! I shall destroy them, and
lay ruin and devastation upon them!"

And then King Ajātasattu addressed Vassakāra
the brahmin minister of Magadha, "Please, brahmin, go to the Buddha, and
in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and
well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably. And then say: 'Sir, King
Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, wants
to invade the Vajjis. He has declared: "I shall wipe out these Vajjis,
so mighty and powerful! I shall destroy them, and lay ruin and
devastation upon them!"' Remember well how the Buddha answers and tell
it to me. For Realized Ones say nothing that is not so."

"Yes, sir," Vassakāra replied. He went to the Buddha and
exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation
were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:

"Mister Gotama, King Ajātasattu bows with his head to your
feet. He asks if you are healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living
comfortably. King Ajātasattu wants to invade the Vajjis. He
has declared: 'I shall wipe out these Vajjis, so mighty and powerful! I
shall destroy them, and lay ruin and devastation upon them!'"

Now at that time Venerable Ānanda was standing behind the Buddha fanning
him. Then the Buddha said to him: "Ānanda, have you heard that the
Vajjis meet frequently and have many meetings?"

"I have heard that, sir."

"As long as the Vajjis meet frequently and have many meetings, they can
expect growth, not decline.

Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis meet in harmony, leave in
harmony, and carry on their business in harmony?"

"I have heard that, sir."

"As long as the Vajjis meet in harmony, leave in harmony, and carry on
their business in harmony, they can expect growth, not decline.

Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis don't make new decrees or abolish
existing decrees, but proceed having undertaken the ancient Vajjian
principles as they have been decreed?"

"I have heard that, sir."

"As long as the Vajjis don't make new decrees or abolish existing
decrees, but proceed having undertaken the ancient Vajjian traditions as
they have been decreed, they can expect growth, not decline.

Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and
venerate Vajjian elders, and think them worth listening to?"

"I have heard that, sir."

"As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate Vajjian
elders, and think them worth listening to, they can expect growth, not
decline.

Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis don't forcibly abduct the women
or girls of the clans and make them live with them?"

"I have heard that, sir."

"As long as the Vajjis don't forcibly abduct the women or girls of the
clans and make them live with them, they can expect growth, not decline.

Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and
venerate the Vajjian shrines, whether inner or outer, not neglecting the
proper spirit-offerings that were given and made in the past?"

"I have heard that, sir."

"As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Vajjian
shrines, whether inner or outer, not neglecting the proper
spirit-offerings that were given and made in the past, they can expect
growth, not decline.

Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis organize proper protection,
shelter, and security for perfected ones, so that more perfected ones
might come to the realm and those already here may live in comfort?"

"I have heard that, sir."

"As long as the Vajjis organize proper protection, shelter, and security
for perfected ones, so that more perfected ones might come to the realm
and those already here may live in comfort, they can expect growth, not
decline."

Then the Buddha said to Vassakāra:

"Brahmin, this one time I was staying near Vesālī at the
Sārandada woodland shrine. There I taught the Vajjis these
principles that prevent decline. As long as these seven principles that
prevent decline last among the Vajjis, and as long as the Vajjis are
seen following them, they can expect growth, not decline."

When the Buddha had spoken, Vassakāra said to him: "Mister
Gotama, if the Vajjis follow even a single one of these principles they
can expect growth, not decline. How much more so all seven! King
Ajātasattu cannot defeat the Vajjis in war, unless by
bribery or by sowing dissension. Well, now, Mister Gotama, I must go. I
have many duties, and much to do."

"Please, brahmin, go at your convenience." Then Vassakāra
the brahmin, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, got
up from his seat and left.

### AN 7.23 Non-Decline for Mendicants (1st)  *Paṭhamasattakasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Rājagaha, on the Vulture's Peak Mountain. There the Buddha
addressed the mendicants:

"Mendicants, I will teach you these seven principles that prevent
decline. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"What are the seven principles that prevent decline? As long as the
mendicants meet frequently and have many meetings, they can expect
growth, not decline.

As long as the mendicants meet in harmony, leave in harmony, and carry
on their business in harmony, they can expect growth, not decline.

As long as the mendicants don't make new decrees or abolish existing
decrees, but undertake and follow the training rules as they have been
decreed, they can expect growth, not decline.

As long as the mendicants honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the
senior mendicants---of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and
leaders of the Saṅgha---and think them worth listening to,
they can expect growth, not decline.

As long as the mendicants don't fall under the sway of arisen craving
for future lives, they can expect growth, not decline.

As long as the mendicants take care to live in wilderness lodgings, they
can expect growth, not decline.

As long as the mendicants individually establish mindfulness, so that
more good-hearted spiritual companions might come, and those that have
already come may live comfortably, they can expect growth, not decline.

As long as these seven principles that prevent decline last among the
mendicants, and as long as the mendicants are seen following them, they
can expect growth, not decline."

### AN 7.24 Non-Decline for Mendicants (2nd)  *Dutiyasattakasutta*

"Mendicants, I will teach you seven principles that prevent decline.
Listen and apply your mind well ... And what are the seven principles

As long as the mendicants don't relish work, loving it and liking to
relish it, they can expect growth, not decline.

As long as they don't enjoy talk ... sleep ... company ... they don't

don't have bad friends, companions, and associates ... they don't stop
half-way after achieving some insignificant distinction, they can expect
growth, not decline.

As long as these seven principles that prevent decline last among the
mendicants, and as long as the mendicants are seen following them, they
can expect growth, not decline."

### AN 7.28 Non-decline for a Mendicant Trainee  *Paṭhamaparihānisutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:

"These seven things lead to the decline of a mendicant trainee. What
seven? They relish work, talk, sleep, and company. They don't guard the
sense doors and they eat too much. And when there is Saṅgha
business to be carried out, they don't reflect: 'There are senior
mendicants in the Saṅgha of long standing, long gone forth,
responsible. They'll be known for taking care of this.' So they try to
do it themselves. These seven things lead to the decline of a mendicant
trainee.

These seven things don't lead to the decline of a mendicant trainee.

decline of a mendicant trainee."

### AN 7.29 Non-decline for a Lay Follower  *Dutiyaparihānisutta*

"These seven things lead to the decline of a lay follower. What seven?
They miss out on seeing the mendicants. They neglect listening to the
true teaching. They don't train in higher ethical conduct. They're very
suspicious about mendicants, whether senior, junior, or middle. They
listen to the teaching with a hostile, fault-finding mind. They seek
outside of the Buddhist community for those worthy of religious
donations. And they serve them first. These seven things lead to the
decline of a lay follower.

These seven things don't lead to the decline of a lay follower. What
seven? They don't miss out on seeing the mendicants. They don't neglect
listening to the true teaching. They train in higher ethical conduct.
They're very confident about mendicants, whether senior, junior, or
middle. They don't listen to the teaching with a hostile, fault-finding
mind. They don't seek outside of the Buddhist community for those worthy
of religious donations. And they serve the Buddhist community first.
These seven things don't lead to the decline of a lay follower."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "A lay follower misses out on seeing\
> those who are evolved\
> and listening to the teachings of the Noble One.\
> They don't train in higher ethical conduct,
>
> and their suspicion about mendicants\
> just grows and grows.\
> They want to listen to the true teaching\
> with a fault-finding mind.
>
> They seek outside the Buddhist community\
> for someone else worthy of religious donations,\
> and that lay follower\
> serves them first.
>
> These seven principles leading to decline\
> have been well taught.\
> A lay follower who practices them\
> falls away from the true teaching.
>
> A lay follower doesn't miss out on seeing\

"Mendicants, there are these seven failures for a lay follower ...

There are these seven accomplishments for a lay follower ..."
