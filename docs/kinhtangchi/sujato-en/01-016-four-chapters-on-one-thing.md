### N 1.296--305 *Paṭhamavagga*

296\. "One thing, mendicants, when developed and cultivated, leads solely to
disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and
extinguishment. What one thing? Recollection of the Buddha. This one
thing, when developed and cultivated, leads solely to disillusionment,
dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment."

<!--pg-->
297--305\. "One thing, mendicants, when developed and cultivated, leads solely to
disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and
extinguishment. What one thing? Recollection of the teaching ...
Recollection of the [Saṅgha]{lang="sa"} ... Recollection of ethical
conduct ... Recollection of generosity ... Recollection of the deities
... Mindfulness of breathing ... Mindfulness of death ... Mindfulness of
the body ... Recollection of peace. This one thing, when developed and
cultivated, leads solely to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation,
peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment."

### N 1.306--315 *Dutiyavagga*

306\. "Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to unskillful
qualities, or, when they have arisen, makes them increase and grow like
wrong view. When you have wrong view, unskillful qualities arise or,
when they have arisen, they increase and grow."

<!--pg-->
307\. "Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to skillful
qualities, or, when they have arisen, makes them increase and grow like
right view. When you have right view, unarisen skillful qualities arise
or, when they have arisen, they increase and grow."

<!--pg-->
308\. "Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to unskillful
qualities, or makes skillful qualities decline like wrong view. When you
have wrong view, unskillful qualities arise and skillful qualities
decline."

<!--pg-->
309\. "Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to skillful
qualities, or makes unskillful qualities decline like right view. When
you have right view, skillful qualities arise and unskillful qualities
decline."

<!--pg-->
310\. "Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to wrong view,
and once arisen, makes it grow like irrational application of mind. When
you apply the mind irrationally, wrong view arises, and once arisen it
grows."

<!--pg-->
311\. "Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to right view,
or, once it has already arisen, makes it grow like rational application
of mind. When you apply the mind rationally, right view arises, and once
arisen it grows."

<!--pg-->
312\. "Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that causes sentient beings to
be reborn, when their body breaks up, after death, in a place of loss, a
bad place, the underworld, hell like wrong view. It is because they have
wrong view that sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death,
are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell."

<!--pg-->
313\. "Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that causes sentient beings to
be reborn, when their body breaks up, after death, in a good place, a
heavenly realm like right view. It is because they have right view that
sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a
good place, a heavenly realm."

<!--pg-->
314\. "Mendicants, when an individual has wrong view, whatever bodily, verbal,
or mental deeds they undertake in line with that view, their intentions,
aims, wishes, and choices all lead to what is unlikable, undesirable,
disagreeable, harmful, and suffering. Why is that? Because their view is
bad. Suppose a seed of neem, angled gourd, or bitter gourd was planted
in moist earth. Whatever nutrients it takes up from the earth and water
would lead to its bitter, acerbic, and unpleasant taste. Why is that?
Because the seed is bad. In the same way, when an individual has wrong
view, whatever bodily, verbal, or mental deeds they undertake in line
with that view, their intentions, aims, wishes, and choices all lead to
what is unlikable, undesirable, disagreeable, harmful, and suffering.
Why is that? Because their view is bad."

<!--pg-->
315\. "Mendicants, when an individual has right view, whatever bodily, verbal,
or mental deeds they undertake in line with that view, their intentions,
aims, wishes, and choices all lead to what is likable, desirable,
agreeable, beneficial, and pleasant. Why is that? Because their view is
good. Suppose a seed of sugar cane, fine rice, or grape was planted in
moist earth. Whatever nutrients it takes up from the earth and water
would lead to its sweet, pleasant, and delicious taste. Why is that?
Because the seed is good. In the same way, when an individual has right
view, whatever bodily, verbal, or mental deeds they undertake in line
with that view, their intentions, aims, wishes, and choices all lead to
what is likable, desirable, agreeable, beneficial, and pleasant. Why is
that? Because their view is good."

### N 1.316--332 *Tatiyavagga*

316\. "One person, mendicants, arises in the world for the detriment and
suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm, detriment,
and suffering of gods and humans. What one person? Someone with wrong
view, whose perspective is distorted. They draw many people away from
the true teaching and establish them in false teachings. This is one
person who arises in the world for the detriment and suffering of the
people, against the people, for the harm, detriment, and suffering of
gods and humans."

<!--pg-->
317\. "One person, mendicants, arises in the world for the welfare and
happiness of the people, for the people, for the benefit, welfare, and
happiness of gods and humans. What one person? Someone with right view,
whose perspective is undistorted. They draw many people away from false
teachings and establish them in the true teaching. This is one person
who arises in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, for
the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans."

<!--pg-->
318\. "Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that is so very blameworthy as
wrong view. Wrong view is the most blameworthy thing of all."

<!--pg-->
319\. "Mendicants, I do not see a single other person who acts for the
detriment and suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm,
detriment, and suffering of gods and humans, as that futile man, the
bamboo-staffed ascetic. Just as a trap set at the mouth of a river would
bring harm, suffering, calamity, and disaster for many fish, so too that
futile man, the bamboo-staffed ascetic, is a trap for humans, it seems
to me. He has arisen in the world for the harm, suffering, calamity, and
disaster of many beings."

<!--pg-->
320\. "Mendicants, the one who encourages someone in a poorly explained
teaching and training, the one who they encourage, and the one who
practices accordingly all create much wickedness. Why is that? Because
the teaching is poorly explained."

<!--pg-->
321\. "Mendicants, the one who encourages someone in a well explained teaching
and training, the one who they encourage, and the one who practices
accordingly all create much merit. Why is that? Because the teaching is
well explained."

<!--pg-->
322\. "Mendicants, in a poorly explained teaching and training, the donor
should know moderation, not the recipient. Why is that? Because the
teaching is poorly explained."

<!--pg-->
323\. "Mendicants, in a well explained teaching and training, the recipient
should know moderation, not the donor. Why is that? Because the teaching
is well explained."

<!--pg-->
324\. "Mendicants, in a poorly explained teaching and training an energetic
person lives in suffering. Why is that? Because the teaching is poorly
explained."

<!--pg-->
325\. "Mendicants, in a well explained teaching and training a lazy person
lives in suffering. Why is that? Because the teaching is well
explained."

<!--pg-->
326\. "Mendicants, in a poorly explained teaching and training a lazy person
lives happily. Why is that? Because the teaching is poorly explained."

<!--pg-->
327\. "Mendicants, in a well explained teaching and training an energetic
person lives happily. Why is that? Because the teaching is well
explained."

<!--pg-->
328\. "Just as, mendicants, even a tiny bit of fecal matter still stinks, so
too I don't approve of even a tiny bit of continued existence, not even
as long as a finger-snap."

<!--pg-->
329--332\. "Just as even a tiny bit of urine, or spit, or pus, or blood still
stinks, so too I don't approve of even a tiny bit of continued
existence, not even as long as a finger-snap."

<!--pg-->
### N 1.333--377 *Catutthavagga*

333\. "Just as, mendicants, in the Black Plum Tree Land the delightful parks,

<!--pg-->
339\. ... so too the sentient beings who get to hear the teaching and training
proclaimed by a Realized One are few, while those sentient beings who

<!--pg-->
340\. ... so too the sentient beings who remember the teachings they hear are
few, while those who don't remember the teachings are many.

<!--pg-->
341\. ... so too the sentient beings who examine the meaning of the teachings
they have memorized are few, while those who don't examine the meaning
of the teachings are many.

teaching and practice accordingly are few, while those who understand
the meaning and the teaching but don't practice accordingly are many.

<!--pg-->
343\. ... so too the sentient beings inspired by inspiring places are few,
while those who are uninspired are many.

<!--pg-->
344\. ... so too the sentient beings who, being inspired, strive effectively
are few, while those who, even though inspired, don't strive effectively
are many.

<!--pg-->
345\. ... so too the sentient beings who, relying on letting go, gain
immersion, gain unification of mind are few, while those who don't gain
immersion, don't gain unification of mind relying on letting go are
many.

<!--pg-->
346\. ... so too the sentient beings who get the best food and flavors are
few, while those who don't get the best food and flavors, but get by
with scraps in an alms bowl are many.

<!--pg-->
347\. ... so too the sentient beings who get the essence of the meaning, the
essence of the teaching, and the essence of freedom are few, while the
sentient beings who don't get the essence of the meaning, the essence of
the teaching, and the essence of freedom are many.

<!--pg-->
So you should train like this: 'We will get the essence of the meaning,
the essence of the teaching, the essence of freedom.' That's how you
should train."

348--350\. "Just as, mendicants, in the Black Plum Tree Land the delightful parks,
woods, meadows, and lotus ponds are few, while the hilly terrain,
inaccessible riverlands, stumps and thorns, and rugged mountains are
many; so too, those who die as humans and are reborn as humans are few,
while those who die as humans and are reborn in hell, or the animal
realm, or the ghost realm are many."
