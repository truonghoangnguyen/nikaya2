# The Chapter on Wealth

### AN 7.1 Pleasing (1st)  *Paṭhamapiyasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, a mendicant with seven qualities is disliked and
disapproved by their spiritual companions, not respected or admired.
What seven? It's when a mendicant desires material things, honor, and
status. They lack conscience and prudence. They have corrupt wishes and
wrong view. A mendicant with these seven qualities is disliked and
disapproved by their spiritual companions, not respected or admired.

A mendicant with seven qualities is liked and approved by their
spiritual companions, respected and admired. What seven? It's when a
mendicant doesn't desire material things, honor, and status. They have
conscience and prudence. They have few desires and right view. A
mendicant with these seven qualities is liked and approved by their
spiritual companions, respected and admired."

"Mendicants, there are these seven powers. What seven? The powers of
faith, energy, conscience, prudence, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom.

And what is the power of faith? It's when a noble disciple has faith in
the Realized One's awakening: 'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully
awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of
the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods
and humans, awakened, blessed.' This is called the power of faith.

And what is the power of energy? It's when a noble disciple lives with
energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing
skillful qualities. They're strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off
when it comes to developing skillful qualities. This is called the power
of energy.

And what is the power of conscience? It's when a noble disciple has a
conscience. They're conscientious about bad conduct by way of body,
speech, and mind, and conscientious about acquiring any bad, unskillful
qualities. This is called the power of conscience.

And what is the power of prudence? It's when a noble disciple is
prudent. They're prudent when it comes to bad conduct by way of body,
speech, and mind, and prudent when it comes to the acquiring of any bad,
unskillful qualities. This is called the power of prudence.

And what is the power of mindfulness? It's when a noble disciple is
mindful. They have utmost mindfulness and alertness, and can remember
and recall what was said and done long ago. This is called the power of
mindfulness.

And what is the power of immersion? It's when a noble disciple, quite
secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities,
enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and
bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it
connected. ... Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness
and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without
pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. This is called
the power of immersion.

And what is the power of wisdom? It's when a noble disciple is wise.
They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble,
penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. This is
called the power of wisdom.

These are the seven powers.

### AN 7.7 With Ugga  *Uggasutta*

Then Ugga the government chief minister went up to the Buddha, bowed,
sat down to one side, and said to him, "It's incredible, sir, it's
amazing! Migāra of Rohaṇa is so rich, so very
wealthy."

"But Ugga, how rich is he?"

"He has a hundred thousand gold coins, not to mention the silver coins!"

"Well, Ugga, that is wealth, I can't deny it. But fire, water, rulers,
thieves, and unloved heirs all take a share of that wealth. There are
these seven kinds of wealth that they can't take a share of. What seven?
