### AN 1.316--332 *Tatiyavagga*

316\. "One person, mendicants, arises in the world for the detriment and
suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm, detriment,
and suffering of gods and humans. What one person? Someone with wrong
view, whose perspective is distorted. They draw many people away from
the true teaching and establish them in false teachings. This is one
person who arises in the world for the detriment and suffering of the
people, against the people, for the harm, detriment, and suffering of
gods and humans."

317\. "One person, mendicants, arises in the world for the welfare and
happiness of the people, for the people, for the benefit, welfare, and
happiness of gods and humans. What one person? Someone with right view,
whose perspective is undistorted. They draw many people away from false
teachings and establish them in the true teaching. This is one person
who arises in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, for
the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans."

wrong view. Wrong view is the most blameworthy thing of all."

319\. "Mendicants, I do not see a single other person who acts for the
detriment and suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm,
detriment, and suffering of gods and humans, as that futile man, the
bamboo-staffed ascetic. Just as a trap set at the mouth of a river would
bring harm, suffering, calamity, and disaster for many fish, so too that
futile man, the bamboo-staffed ascetic, is a trap for humans, it seems
to me. He has arisen in the world for the harm, suffering, calamity, and
disaster of many beings."

teaching and training, the one who they encourage, and the one who
practices accordingly all create much wickedness. Why is that? Because
the teaching is poorly explained."

<!--pg-->

should know moderation, not the donor. Why is that? Because the teaching
is well explained."

328\. "Just as, mendicants, even a tiny bit of fecal matter still stinks, so
too I don't approve of even a tiny bit of continued existence, not even
as long as a finger-snap."

<!--pg-->
329--332\. "Just as even a tiny bit of urine, or spit, or pus, or blood still
stinks, so too I don't approve of even a tiny bit of continued
existence, not even as long as a finger-snap."
