# The Chapter on a Great Sacrifice

### AN 7.44 Planes of Consciousness  *Sattaviññāṇaṭṭhitisutta*

"Mendicants, there are these seven planes of consciousness. What seven?

There are sentient beings that are diverse in body and diverse in
perception, such as human beings, some gods, and some beings in the
underworld. This is the first plane of consciousness.

There are sentient beings that are diverse in body and unified in
perception, such as the gods reborn in the Divinity's host through the
first absorption. This is the second plane of consciousness.

There are sentient beings that are unified in body and diverse in
perception, such as the gods of streaming radiance. This is the third
plane of consciousness.

There are sentient beings that are unified in body and unified in
perception, such as the gods of universal beauty. This is the fourth
plane of consciousness.

There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond perceptions of
form. With the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on
perceptions of diversity, aware that 'space is infinite', they have been
reborn in the dimension of infinite space. This is the fifth plane of
consciousness.

There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond the dimension of
infinite space. Aware that 'consciousness is infinite', they have been
reborn in the dimension of infinite consciousness. This is the sixth
plane of consciousness.

There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond the dimension of
infinite consciousness. Aware that 'there is nothing at all', they have
been reborn in the dimension of nothingness. This is the seventh plane
of consciousness.

These are the seven planes of consciousness."

### AN 7.45 Prerequisites for Immersion  *Samādhiparikkhārasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these seven prerequisites for immersion. What
seven? Right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right
livelihood, right effort, and right mindfulness. Unification of mind
with these seven factors as prerequisites is what is called noble right
immersion 'with its vital conditions' and also 'with its
prerequisites'."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.46 Fires (1st)  *Paṭhamaaggisutta*

"Mendicants, there are these seven fires. What seven? The fires of
greed, hate, delusion. The fire of those worthy of offerings dedicated
to the gods. A householder's fire. The fire of those worthy of a
religious donation. And a wood fire. These are the seven fires."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.47 Fires (2nd)  *Dutiyaaggisutta*

Now at that time the brahmin Uggatasarīra had prepared a
large sacrifice. Bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats and rams---five hundred
of each---had been led to the post for the sacrifice.

Then the brahmin Uggatasarīra went up to the Buddha, and
exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation
were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, "Mister
Gotama, I have heard that kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the
sacrificial post is very fruitful and beneficial."

"I've also heard this, brahmin."

For a second time ... and third time Uggatasarīra said to
the Buddha, "Mister Gotama, I have heard that kindling the sacrificial
fire and raising the sacrificial post is very fruitful and beneficial."

"I've also heard this, brahmin."

"Then Mister Gotama and I are in total agreement in this matter."

When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to Uggatasarīra,
"Brahmin, you shouldn't ask the Buddha in this way. You should ask in
this way: 'Sir, I want to kindle the sacrificial fire and raise the
sacrificial post. May the Buddha please advise and instruct me. It will
be for my lasting welfare and happiness.'"

Then Uggatasarīra said to the Buddha, "Mister Gotama, I
want to kindle the sacrificial fire and raise the sacrificial post. May
Mister Gotama please advise and instruct me. It will be for my lasting
welfare and happiness."

"Even before kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial
post, one raises three unskillful knives which ripen and result in
suffering. What three? The knives of the body, speech, and mind. Even
before kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post
one gives rise to the thought: 'May this many bulls, bullocks, heifers,
goats, and rams be slaughtered for the sacrifice!' Thinking, 'May I make
goodness', one makes wickedness. Thinking, 'May I do good', one does
bad. Thinking, 'May I seek the path to a good rebirth', one seeks the
path to a bad rebirth. Even before kindling the sacrificial fire and
raising the sacrificial post one raises this first unskillful mental
knife which ripens and results in suffering.

Furthermore, even before kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the
sacrificial post, one says such things as: 'May this many bulls,
bullocks, heifers, goats, and rams be slaughtered for the sacrifice!'
Thinking, 'May I make goodness', one makes wickedness. Thinking, 'May I
do good', one does bad. Thinking, 'May I seek the path to a good
rebirth', one seeks the path to a bad rebirth. Even before kindling the
sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post one raises this second
unskillful verbal knife which ripens and results in suffering.

Furthermore, even before kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the
sacrificial post one first personally undertakes preparations for the
sacrificial slaughter of bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats, and rams.
Thinking, 'May I make goodness', one makes wickedness. Thinking, 'May I
do good', one does bad. Thinking, 'May I seek the path to a good
rebirth', one seeks the path to a bad rebirth. Even before kindling the
sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post, one raises this third
unskillful bodily knife which ripens and results in suffering. Even
before kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post,
one raises these three unskillful knives which ripen and result in
suffering.

Brahmin, these three fires should be given up and rejected, not
cultivated. What three? The fires of greed, hate, and delusion.

And why should the fire of greed be given up and rejected, not
cultivated? A greedy person does bad things by way of body, speech, and
mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they're reborn in a place
of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. That's why the fire of greed
should be given up and rejected, not cultivated.

And why should the fire of hate be given up and rejected, not
cultivated? A hateful person does bad things by way of body, speech, and
mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they're reborn in a place
of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. That's why the fire of hate
should be given up and rejected, not cultivated.

And why should the fire of delusion be given up and rejected, not
cultivated? A deluded person does bad things by way of body, speech, and
mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they're reborn in a place
of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. That's why the fire of
delusion should be given up and rejected, not cultivated. These three
fires should be given up and rejected, not cultivated.

Brahmin, you should properly and happily take care of three fires,
honoring, respecting, esteeming, and venerating them. What three? The
fire of those worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods. The fire of a
householder. And the fire of those worthy of a religious donation.

And what is the fire of those worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods?
Your mother and father are called the fire of those worthy of offerings
dedicated to the gods. Why is that? Since it is from them that you've
been incubated and produced. So you should properly and happily take
care of this fire, honoring, respecting, esteeming, and venerating it.

And what is the fire of a householder? Your children, partners,
bondservants, servants, and workers are called a householder's fire. So
you should properly and happily take care of this fire, honoring,
respecting, esteeming, and venerating it.

And what is the fire of those worthy of a religious donation? The
ascetics and brahmins who refrain from intoxication and negligence, are
settled in patience and sweetness, and who tame, calm, and extinguish
themselves are called the fire of those worthy of a religious donation.
So you should properly and happily take care of this fire, honoring,
respecting, esteeming, and venerating it. You should properly and
happily take care of these three fires, honoring, respecting, esteeming,
and venerating them.

But the wood fire, brahmin, should, from time to time, be fanned,
watched over with equanimity, extinguished, or put aside."

When he said this, the brahmin Uggatasarīra said to the
Buddha, "Excellent, Mister Gotama! Excellent! ... From this day forth,
may Mister Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge
for life. Mister Gotama, I now set free these five hundred bulls, five
hundred bullocks, five hundred heifers, five hundred goats, and five
hundred rams. I give them life! May they eat grass and drink cool water
and enjoy a cool breeze!"

### AN 7.48 Perceptions in Brief  *Paṭhamasaññāsutta*

"Mendicants, these seven perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are
very fruitful and beneficial. They culminate in freedom from death and
end in freedom from death.

What seven? The perceptions of ugliness, death, repulsiveness of food,
dissatisfaction with the whole world, impermanence, suffering in
impermanence, and not-self in suffering. These seven perceptions, when
developed and cultivated, are very fruitful and beneficial. They
culminate in freedom from death and end in freedom from death."

<!--pg-->
### AN 7.49 Perceptions in Detail  *Dutiyasaññāsutta*

"Mendicants, these seven perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are
very fruitful and beneficial. They culminate in freedom from death and
end in freedom from death. What seven? The perceptions of ugliness,
death, repulsiveness of food, dissatisfaction with the whole world,
impermanence, suffering in impermanence, and not-self in suffering.
These seven perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are very
fruitful and beneficial. They culminate in freedom from death and end in
freedom from death.

'When the perception of ugliness is developed and cultivated it's very
fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in freedom from death and ends in
freedom from death.' That's what I said, but why did I say it? When a
mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the perception of
ugliness, their mind draws back from sexual intercourse. They shrink
away, turn aside, and don't get drawn into it. And either equanimity or
revulsion become stabilized. It's like a chicken's feather or a scrap of
sinew thrown in a fire. It shrivels up, shrinks, rolls up, and doesn't
stretch out. In the same way, when a mendicant often meditates with a
mind reinforced with the perception of ugliness, their mind draws back
from sexual intercourse. ...

If a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the
perception of ugliness, but their mind is drawn to sexual intercourse,
and not repulsed, they should know: 'My perception of ugliness is
undeveloped. I don't have any distinction higher than before. I haven't
attained a fruit of development.' In this way they are aware of the
situation. But if a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced
with the perception of ugliness, their mind draws back from sexual
intercourse ... they should know: 'My perception of ugliness is well
developed. I have realized a distinction higher than before. I have
attained a fruit of development.' In this way they are aware of the
situation. 'When the perception of ugliness is developed and cultivated
it's very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in freedom from death
and ends in freedom from death.' That's what I said, and this is why I
said it.

'When the perception of death is developed and cultivated it's very
fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in freedom from death and ends in
freedom from death.' That's what I said, but why did I say it? When a
mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the perception of
death, their mind draws back from desire to be reborn. ... That's what I
said, and this is why I said it.

'When the perception of the repulsiveness of food is developed and
cultivated it's very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in freedom
from death and ends in freedom from death.' That's what I said, but why
did I say it? When a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced
with the perception of the repulsiveness of food, their mind draws back
from craving for tastes. ... That's what I said, and this is why I said
it.

'When the perception of dissatisfaction with the whole world is
developed and cultivated it's very fruitful and beneficial. It
culminates in freedom from death and ends in freedom from death.' That's
what I said, but why did I say it? When a mendicant often meditates with
a mind reinforced with the perception of dissatisfaction with the whole
world, their mind draws back from the world's shiny things. ... That's
what I said, and this is why I said it.

'When the perception of impermanence is developed and cultivated it's
very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in freedom from death and
ends in freedom from death.' That's what I said, but why did I say it?
When a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the
perception of impermanence, their mind draws back from material things,
honors, and fame. ... That's what I said, and this is why I said it.

'When the perception of suffering in impermanence is developed and
cultivated it's very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in freedom
from death and ends in freedom from death.' That's what I said, but why
did I say it? When a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced
with the perception of suffering in impermanence, they establish a keen
perception of the danger of sloth, laziness, slackness, negligence, lack
of commitment, and failure to review, like a killer with a drawn sword.
... That's what I said, and this is why I said it.

'When the perception of not-self in suffering is developed and
cultivated it's very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in freedom
from death and ends in freedom from death.' That's what I said, but why
did I say it? When a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced
with the perception of not-self in suffering, their mind is rid of
I-making, mine-making, and conceit for this conscious body and all
external stimuli. It has gone beyond discrimination, and is peaceful and
well freed.

If a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the
perception of not-self in suffering, but their mind is not rid of
I-making, mine-making, and conceit for this conscious body and all
external stimuli; nor has it gone beyond discrimination, and is not
peaceful or well freed, they should know: 'My perception of not-self in
suffering is undeveloped. I don't have any distinction higher than
before. I haven't attained a fruit of development.' In this way they are
aware of the situation.

But if a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the
perception of not-self in suffering, and their mind is rid of I-making,
mine-making, and conceit for this conscious body and all external
stimuli; and it has gone beyond discrimination, and is peaceful and well
freed, they should know: 'My perception of not-self in suffering is well
developed. I have realized a distinction higher than before. I have
attained a fruit of development.' In this way they are aware of the
situation. 'When the perception of not-self in suffering is developed
and cultivated it's very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in
freedom from death and ends in freedom from death.' That's what I said,
and this is why I said it.

These seven perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are very
fruitful and beneficial. They culminate in freedom from death and end in
freedom from death."

### AN 7.50 Sex  *Methunasutta*

Then the brahmin Jānussoṇi went up to the Buddha, and
exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation
were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, "Does Mister
Gotama claim to be celibate?"

"Brahmin, if anyone should be rightly said to live the celibate life
intact, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, full and pure, it's me."

"But what, Mister Gotama, is a break, taint, stain, or mar in celibacy?"

"Firstly, an ascetic or brahmin who claims to be perfectly celibate does
not mutually engage in sex with a female. However, they consent to being
anointed, massaged, bathed, and rubbed by a female. They enjoy it and
like it and find it satisfying. This is a break, taint, stain, or mar in
celibacy. This is called one who lives the celibate life impurely, yoked
by the yoke of sex. They're not freed from rebirth, old age, death,
sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They're not freed from
suffering, I say.

Furthermore, an ascetic or brahmin who claims to be perfectly celibate
does not mutually engage in sex with a female. Nor do they consent to
massage and bathing. However, they giggle and play and have fun with
females. ...

they gaze into a female's eyes. ...

they listen through a wall or rampart to the sound of females laughing
or chatting or singing or crying. ...

they recall when they used to laugh, chat, and have fun with females ...

they see a householder or their child amusing themselves, supplied and
provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. ...

They don't see a householder or their child amusing themselves, supplied
and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. However, they
live the celibate life wishing to be reborn in one of the orders of
gods. They think: 'By this precept or observance or fervent austerity or
spiritual life, may I become one of the gods!' They enjoy it and like it
and find it satisfying. This is a break, taint, stain, or mar in
celibacy. This is called one who lives the celibate life impurely, yoked
by the yoke of sex. They're not free from rebirth, old age, death,
sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They're not free from
suffering, I say.

As long as I saw that these seven sexual yokes---or even one of
them---had not been given up in me, I didn't announce my supreme perfect
awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and
Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and
humans.

But when I saw that these seven sexual yokes---every one of them---had
been given up in me, I announced my supreme perfect awakening in this
world with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population
with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. Knowledge and
vision arose in me: 'My freedom is unshakable; this is my last rebirth;
now there'll be no more future lives.'"

When he said this, the brahmin Jānussoṇi said to the
Buddha, "Excellent, Mister Gotama! Excellent! ... From this day forth,
may Mister Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge
for life."

### AN 7.51 Yoking and Unyoking  *Saṁyogasutta*

"Mendicants, I will teach you an exposition of the teaching on yoking
and unyoking. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak. ... And
what is the exposition of the teaching on yoking and unyoking?

A woman focuses on her own femininity: her feminine moves, feminine
appearance, feminine ways, feminine desires, feminine voice, and
feminine adornment. She's stimulated by this and takes pleasure in it.
So she focuses on the masculinity of others: masculine moves, masculine
appearance, masculine ways, masculine desires, masculine voice, and
masculine adornment. She's stimulated by this and takes pleasure in it.
So she desires to yoke herself to another. And she desires the pleasure
and happiness that comes from such yoking. Sentient beings who relish
their femininity are yoked to men. This is how a woman does not
transcend her femininity.

A man focuses on his own masculinity: his masculine moves, masculine
appearance, masculine ways, masculine desires, masculine voice, and
masculine adornment. He's stimulated by this and takes pleasure in it.

appearance, feminine ways, feminine desires, feminine voice, and
feminine adornment. He's stimulated by this and takes pleasure in it. So
he desires to yoke himself to another. And he desires the pleasure and
happiness that comes from such yoking. Sentient beings who relish their
masculinity are yoked to women. This is how a man does not transcend his
masculinity. This is how yoking comes about.

And how does unyoking come about? A woman doesn't focus on her own
femininity: her feminine moves, feminine appearance, feminine ways,
feminine desires, feminine voice, and feminine adornment. She isn't
stimulated by this and takes no pleasure in it. So she doesn't focus on
the masculinity of others: masculine moves, masculine appearance,
masculine ways, masculine desires, masculine voice, and masculine
adornment. She isn't stimulated by this and takes no pleasure in it. So
she doesn't desire to yoke herself to another. Nor does she desire the
pleasure and happiness that comes from such yoking. Sentient beings who
do not relish their femininity are not yoked to men. This is how a woman
transcends her femininity.

and unyoking."

### AN 7.52 A Very Fruitful Gift  *Dānamahapphalasutta*

At one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks
of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond.

Then several lay followers of Campā went to Venerable
Sāriputta, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
"Sir, it's been a long time since we've heard a Dhamma talk from the
Buddha. It would be good if we got to hear a Dhamma talk from the
Buddha."

"Well then, reverends, come on the next sabbath day. Hopefully you'll
get to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha."

"Yes, sir" they replied. Then they rose from their seats, bowed to
Sāriputta, and respectfully circled him before leaving.

Then on the next sabbath the lay followers of Campā went to
Venerable Sāriputta, bowed, and stood to one side. Then
they went together with Sāriputta to the Buddha, bowed, and
sat down to one side. Sāriputta said to the Buddha:

"Sir, could it be that someone gives a gift and it is not very fruitful
or beneficial, while someone else gives exactly the same gift and it is
very fruitful and beneficial?"

"Indeed it could, Sāriputta."

"Sir, what is the cause, what is the reason for this?"

"Sāriputta, take the case of a someone who gives a gift as
an investment, their mind tied to it, expecting to keep it, thinking
'I'll enjoy this in my next life'. They give to ascetics or brahmins
such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and
makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. What do you think,
Sāriputta, don't some people give gifts in this way?"

"Yes, sir."

"Sāriputta, someone who gives a gift as an investment, when
their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in the company of the gods
of the four great kings. When that deed, success, glory, and sovereignty
is spent they return to this place.

Next, take the case of a someone who gives a gift not as an investment,
their mind not tied to it, not expecting to keep it, and not thinking,
'I'll enjoy this in my next life'. But they give a gift thinking, 'It's
good to give' ...

They give a gift thinking, 'Giving was practiced by my father and my
father's father. It would not be right for me to abandon this family
tradition.' ...

They give a gift thinking, 'I cook, they don't. It wouldn't be right for
me to not give to them.' ...

They give a gift thinking, 'The ancient brahmin seers were
Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva,
Vessāmitta, Yamadaggi, Aṅgīrasa,
Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu. Just
as they performed great sacrifices, I will share a gift.' ...

They give a gift thinking, 'When giving this gift my mind becomes clear,
and I become happy and joyful.' ...

They don't give a gift thinking, 'When giving this gift my mind becomes
clear, and I become happy and joyful.' But they give a gift thinking,
'This is an adornment and requisite for the mind.' They give to ascetics
or brahmins such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands,
fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. What do you think,
Sāriputta, don't some people give gifts in this way?"

"Yes, sir."

"Sāriputta, someone who gives gifts, not for any other
reason, but thinking, 'This is an adornment and requisite for the mind',
when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn among the gods of the
Divinity's host. When that deed, success, glory, and sovereignty is
spent they are a non-returner; they do not return to this place.

This is the cause, this is the reason why someone gives a gift and it is
not very fruitful or beneficial, while someone else gives exactly the
same gift and it is very fruitful and beneficial."

### AN 7.53 Nanda's Mother  *Nandamātāsutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the venerables
Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna were wandering in
the Southern Hills together with a large Saṅgha of
mendicants. Now at that time the laywoman Veḷukaṇṭakī,
Nanda's mother, rose at the crack of dawn and recited the verses of "The
Way to the Far Shore".

And at that time the great king Vessavaṇa was on his way
from the north to the south on some business. He heard Nanda's Mother
reciting, and stood waiting for her to finish.

Then when her recital was over she fell silent. Then, knowing she had
finished, Vessavaṇa applauded, saying, "Good, sister! Good,
sister!"

"But who might you be, dearest?"

"Sister, I am your brother Vessavaṇa, the great king."

"Good, dearest! Then may my recital of the teaching be my offering to
you as my guest."

'Good, sister! And let this also be your offering to me as your guest.
Tomorrow, the mendicant Saṅgha headed by
Sāriputta and Moggallāna will arrive at
Veḷukaṇṭa before breakfast. When you've served the
Saṅgha, please dedicate the religious donation to me. Then
that will also be your offering to me as your guest."

And when the night had passed the lay woman Nanda's Mother had delicious
fresh and cooked foods prepared in her own home. Then the
Saṅgha of mendicants headed by Sāriputta and
Moggallāna arrived at Veḷukaṇṭa. Then Nanda's
Mother addressed a man, "Please, mister, go to the monastery and
announce the time to the Saṅgha, saying: 'Sirs, it's time.
The meal is ready in the home of the lady Nanda's Mother.'"

"Yes, Ma'am," that man replied, and he did as she said.

And then the Saṅgha of mendicants headed by
Sāriputta and Moggallāna robed up in the
morning and, taking their bowls and robes, went to the home of Nanda's
Mother, where they sat on the seats spread out. Then Nanda's Mother
served and satisfied them with her own hands with delicious fresh and
cooked foods.

When Sāriputta had eaten and washed his hand and bowl,
Nanda's Mother sat down to one side. Sāriputta said to her,
"Nanda's Mother, who told you that the Saṅgha of mendicants
was about to arrive?"

"Sir, last night I rose at the crack of dawn and recited the verses of
'The Way to the Far Shore', and then I fell silent. Then the great king
Vessavaṇa, knowing I had finished, applauded me, 'Good,
sister! Good, sister!'

I asked: 'But who might you be, dearest?'

'Sister, I am your brother Vessavaṇa, the great king.'

'Good, dearest! Then may my recital of the teaching be my offering to
you as my guest.'

'Good, sister! And let this also be your offering to me as your guest.
Tomorrow, the mendicant Saṅgha headed by
Sāriputta and Moggallāna will arrive at
Veḷukaṇṭa before breakfast. When you've served the
Saṅgha, please dedicate the religious donation to me. Then
that will also be your offering to me as your guest.'

And so, sir, may the merit and the flourishing of merit of this gift be
for the happiness of the great king Vessavaṇa."

"It's incredible, Nanda's Mother, it's amazing that you converse face to
face with a mighty and illustrious god like the great king
Vessavaṇa."

"Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality; there is
another. I had an only son called Nanda who I loved dearly. The rulers
forcibly abducted him on some pretext and had him executed. But I can't
recall getting upset when my boy was under arrest or being arrested,
imprisoned or being put in prison, killed or being killed."

"It's incredible, Nanda's Mother, it's amazing that you purify even the
arising of a thought."

"Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality; there is
another. When my husband passed away he was reborn in one of the realms
of spirits. He revealed to me his previous incarnation. But I can't
recall getting upset on that account."

"It's incredible, Nanda's Mother, it's amazing that you purify even the
arising of a thought."

"Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality; there is
another. Ever since we were both young, and I was given in marriage to
my husband, I can't recall betraying him even in thought, still less in
deed."

"It's incredible, Nanda's Mother, it's amazing that you purify even the
arising of a thought."

"Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality; there is
another. Ever since I declared myself a lay follower, I can't recall
deliberately breaking any precept."

"It's incredible, Nanda's Mother, it's amazing!"

"Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality; there is
another. Whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first
absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while
placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind
and keeping it connected are stilled, I enter and remain in the second
absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with
internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping
it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, I enter and remain in
the third absorption, where I meditate with equanimity, mindful and
aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones
declare, 'Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.' With the
giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and
sadness, I enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure
or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness."

"It's incredible, Nanda's Mother, it's amazing!"

"Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality; there is
another. Of the five lower fetters taught by the Buddha, I don't see any
that I haven't given up."

"It's incredible, Nanda's Mother, it's amazing!"

Then Venerable Sāriputta educated, encouraged, fired up,
and inspired Nanda's Mother with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up
from his seat and left.
