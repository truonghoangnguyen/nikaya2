### AN 8.81 Mindfulness and Situational Awareness  *Satisampajaññasutta*

"Mendicants, when there is no mindfulness and situational awareness, one
who lacks mindfulness and situational awareness has destroyed a vital
condition for conscience and prudence. When there is no conscience and
prudence, one who lacks conscience and prudence has destroyed a vital
condition for sense restraint. When there is no sense restraint, one who
lacks sense restraint has destroyed a vital condition for ethical
conduct. When there is no ethical conduct, one who lacks ethics has
destroyed a vital condition for right immersion. When there is no right
immersion, one who lacks right immersion has destroyed a vital condition
for true knowledge and vision. When there is no true knowledge and
vision, one who lacks true knowledge and vision has destroyed a vital
condition for disillusionment and dispassion. When there is no
disillusionment and dispassion, one who lacks disillusionment and
dispassion has destroyed a vital condition for knowledge and vision of
freedom.

Suppose there was a tree that lacked branches and foliage. Its shoots,
bark, softwood, and heartwood would not grow to fullness.

In the same way, when there is no mindfulness and situational awareness,
one who lacks mindfulness and situational awareness has destroyed a
vital condition for conscience and prudence. When there is no conscience
and prudence ... One who lacks disillusionment and dispassion has
destroyed a vital condition for knowledge and vision of freedom.

When there is mindfulness and situational awareness, one who has
fulfilled mindfulness and situational awareness has fulfilled a vital
condition for conscience and prudence. When there is conscience and
prudence, one who has fulfilled conscience and prudence has fulfilled a
vital condition for sense restraint. When there is sense restraint, one
who has fulfilled sense restraint has fulfilled a vital condition for
ethical conduct. When there is ethical conduct, one who has fulfilled
ethical conduct has fulfilled a vital condition for right immersion.
When there is right immersion, one who has fulfilled right immersion has
fulfilled a vital condition for true knowledge and vision. When there is
true knowledge and vision, one who has fulfilled true knowledge and
vision has fulfilled a vital condition for disillusionment and
dispassion. When there is disillusionment and dispassion, one who has
fulfilled disillusionment and dispassion has fulfilled a vital condition
for knowledge and vision of freedom.

Suppose there was a tree that was complete with branches and foliage.
Its shoots, bark, softwood, and heartwood would grow to fullness.

In the same way, when there is mindfulness and situational awareness,
one who has fulfilled mindfulness and situational awareness has
fulfilled a vital condition for conscience and prudence. When there is
conscience and prudence ... One who has fulfilled disillusionment and
dispassion has fulfilled a vital condition for knowledge and vision of
freedom."

### AN 8.82 With Puṇṇiya  *Puṇṇiyasutta*

Then Venerable Puṇṇiya went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat
down to one side, and said to him:

"Sir, what is the cause, what is the reason why sometimes the Realized
One feels inspired to teach, and other times not?"

"Puṇṇiya, when a mendicant has faith but doesn't approach,
the Realized One doesn't feel inspired to teach. But when a mendicant
has faith and approaches, the Realized One feels inspired to teach. When
a mendicant has faith and approaches, but doesn't pay homage ... they
pay homage, but don't ask questions ... they ask questions, but don't
actively listen to the teaching ... they actively listen to the
teaching, but don't remember the teaching they've heard ... they
remember the teaching they've heard, but don't reflect on the meaning of
the teachings they've remembered ... they reflect on the meaning of the
teachings they've remembered, but, not having understood the meaning and
the teaching, they don't practice accordingly. The Realized One doesn't
feel inspired to teach.

But when a mendicant has faith, approaches, pays homage, asks questions,
actively listen to the teachings, remembers the teachings, reflects on
the meaning, and practices accordingly, the Realized One feels inspired
to teach. When someone has these eight qualities, the Realized One feels
totally inspired to teach."

### AN 8.83 Rooted  *Mūlakasutta*

"Mendicants, if wanderers of other religions were to ask: 'Reverends,
all things have what as their root? What produces them? What is their
origin? What is their meeting place? What is their chief? What is their
ruler? What is their overseer? What is their core?' How would you answer
them?"

"Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge.
Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The
mendicants will listen and remember it."

"Well then, mendicants, I will teach it. Listen and apply your mind
well, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, if wanderers of other religions were to ask: 'Reverends,
all things have what as their root? What produces them? What is their
origin? What is their meeting place? What is their chief? What is their
ruler? What is their overseer? What is their core?' You should answer
them: 'Reverends, all things are rooted in desire. They are produced by
application of mind. Contact is their origin. Feeling is their meeting
place. Immersion is their chief. Mindfulness is their ruler. Wisdom is
their overseer. Freedom is their core.' When questioned by wanderers of
other religions, that's how you should answer them."

### AN 8.84 A Master Thief  *Corasutta*

"Mendicants, a master thief with eight factors is soon executed, and
doesn't have long to live. What eight? He attacks unprovoked. He steals
everything without exception. He kills a woman. He rapes a girl. He robs
a monk. He robs the royal treasury. He works close to home. He's not
skilled at hiding his booty. A master thief with these eight factors is
soon executed, and doesn't have long to live.

A master thief with eight factors is not soon executed, and lives long.

### AN 8.85 Terms for the Realized One  *Samaṇasutta*

"'Ascetic' is a term for the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully
awakened Buddha. 'Brahmin', 'Knowledge Master', 'Healer', 'Unstained',
'Immaculate', 'Knower', and 'Freed' are terms for the Realized One, the
perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.

> The supreme should be attained by an ascetic,\
> a brahmin who has lived the life;\
> it should be attained by a knowledge master,\
> a healer.
>
> The supreme should be attained by the unstained,\
> stainless and pure;\
> it should be attained by a knower,\
> who is free.
>
> I am victorious in battle!\
> Released, I release others from their chains.\
> I am a dragon completely tamed,\
> an adept, I am quenched."

### AN 8.86 With Nāgita  *Yasasutta*

At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans
together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived
at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Icchānaṅgala. He
stayed in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. The brahmins and
householders of Icchānaṅgala heard:

"It seems the ascetic Gotama---a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan
family---has arrived at Icchānaṅgala. He is staying in a
forest near Icchānaṅgala. He has this good reputation:
'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in
knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for
those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.'
... It's good to see such perfected ones."

Then, when the night had passed, they took abundant fresh and cooked
foods and went to the forest near Icchānaṅgala, where they
stood outside the gates making a dreadful racket.

Now, at that time Venerable Nāgita was the Buddha's
attendant. Then the Buddha said to Nāgita,
"Nāgita, who's making that dreadful racket? You'd think it
was fishermen hauling in a catch!"

"Sir, it's these brahmins and householders of Icchānaṅgala.
They've brought abundant fresh and cooked foods, and they're standing
outside the gates wanting to offer it specially to the Buddha and the
mendicant Saṅgha."

"Nāgita, may I never become famous. May fame not come to
me. There are those who can't get the pleasure of renunciation, the
pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the pleasure of awakening
when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can. Let them enjoy
the filthy, lazy pleasure of possessions, honor, and popularity."

"Sir, may the Blessed One please relent now! May the Holy One relent!
Now is the time for the Buddha to relent. Wherever the Buddha now goes,
the brahmins and householders, and people of town and country will
incline the same way. It's like when the heavens rain heavily and the
water flows downhill. In the same way, wherever the Buddha now goes, the
brahmins and householders, and people of town and country will incline
the same way. Why is that? Because of the Buddha's ethics and wisdom."

"Nāgita, may I never become famous. May fame not come to
me. There are those who can't get the pleasure of renunciation, the
pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the pleasure of awakening
when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can. Let them enjoy
the filthy, lazy pleasure of possessions, honor, and popularity.

Even some of the deities can't get the pleasure of renunciation, the
pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the pleasure of awakening
when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can. When you all
come together to enjoy each other's company, I think: 'These venerables
mustn't get the pleasure of renunciation, the pleasure of seclusion, the
pleasure of peace, the pleasure of awakening when they want, without
trouble or difficulty like I can. That must be because they come
together to enjoy each other's company.'

Take mendicants I see poking each other with their fingers, giggling and
playing together. I think to myself: 'These venerables mustn't get the
pleasure of renunciation, the pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of
peace, the pleasure of awakening when they want, without trouble or
difficulty like I can. That must be because they're poking each other
with their fingers, giggling and playing together.'

Take mendicants I see eat as much as they like until their bellies are
full, then indulge in the pleasures of sleeping, lying down, and
drowsing. I think to myself: 'These venerables mustn't get the pleasure
of renunciation, the pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the
pleasure of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like
I can. That must be because they eat as much as they like until their
bellies are full, then indulge in the pleasures of sleeping, lying down,
and drowsing.'

Take a mendicant living within a village who I see sitting immersed in
samādhi. I think to myself: 'Now a monastery worker, a
novice, or a fellow practitioner will make this venerable fall from
immersion.' So I'm not pleased that that mendicant is living within a
village.

Take a mendicant in the wilderness who I see sitting nodding in
meditation. I think to myself: 'Now this venerable, having dispelled
that sleepiness and weariness, will focus just on the unified perception
of wilderness.' So I'm pleased that that mendicant is living in the
wilderness.

Take a mendicant in the wilderness who I see sitting without being
immersed in samādhi. I think to myself: 'Now if this
venerable's mind is not immersed in samādhi they will
immerse it; or if it is immersed in samādhi, they will
preserve it.' So I'm pleased that that mendicant is living in the
wilderness.

Take a mendicant in the wilderness who I see sitting immersed in
samādhi. I think to myself: 'Now this venerable will free
the unfreed mind or preserve the freed mind.' So I'm pleased that that
mendicant is living in the wilderness.

Take a mendicant who I see living within a village receiving robes,
almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. Enjoying
possessions, honor, and popularity they neglect retreat, and they
neglect remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. They come down
to villages, towns and capital cities and make their homes there. So I'm
not pleased that that mendicant is living within a village.

Take a mendicant who I see in the wilderness receiving robes, almsfood,
lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. Fending off
possessions, honor, and popularity they don't neglect retreat, and they
don't neglect remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. So I'm
pleased that that mendicant is living in the wilderness.

Nāgita, when I'm walking along a road and I don't see
anyone ahead or behind I feel relaxed, even if I need to urinate or
defecate."

### AN 8.87 Turning the Bowl Upside Down  *Pattanikujjanasutta*

qualities.

getting material things. They try to harm lay people. They insult and
abuse lay people. They divide lay people against each other. They

The Saṅgha may, if it wishes, revoke the act requiring that

an ordination, give dependence, or be attended by a novice. They must
not consent to being appointed as adviser for nuns, and if they are
appointed they should not give such advice. They must not consent to any
Saṅgha appointment. They must not be put in a position of
