# The Chapter on a Spike

### N 1.41--50 *Paá¹‡ihitaacchavagga*

41\. "Mendicants, suppose a spike of rice or barley was pointing the wrong
way. If you trod on it with hand or foot, it is impossible for it to
break the skin and produce blood. Why is that? Because the spike is
pointing the wrong way. In the same way, it is quite impossible for a
mendicant whose mind is pointing the wrong way to break ignorance,
produce knowledge, and realize extinguishment. Why is that? Because
their mind is pointing the wrong way."

42\. "Mendicants, suppose a spike of rice or barley was pointing the right
way. If you trod on it with hand or foot, it's possible it may break the
skin and produce blood. Why is that? Because the spike is pointing the
right way. In the same way, it is quite possible for a mendicant whose
mind is pointing the right way to break ignorance, produce knowledge,
and realize extinguishment. Why is that? Because the mind is pointing

43\. "Mendicants, when I've comprehended the mind of a person whose mind is
corrupted, I understand: 'If this person were to die right now, they
would be cast down to hell.' Why is that? Because their mind is
corrupted. Corruption of mind is the reason why some sentient beings,
when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a
bad place, the underworld, hell."

44\. "Mendicants, when I've comprehended the mind of a person whose mind is
pure, I understand: 'If this person were to die right now, they would be
raised up to heaven.' Why is that? Because their mind is pure. Purity of
mind is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up,
after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm."

45\. "Suppose, mendicants, there was a lake that was cloudy, murky, and
muddy. A person with clear eyes standing on the bank would not see the
clams and mussels, and pebbles and gravel, and schools of fish swimming
about or staying still. Why is that? Because the water is clouded. In
the same way, that a mendicant whose mind is clouded would know what's
for their own good, the good of another, or the good of both; or that
they would realize any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision
worthy of the noble ones: this is quite impossible. Why is that? Because
their mind is clouded."

46\. "Suppose, mendicants, there was a lake that was transparent, clear, and
unclouded. A person with clear eyes standing on the bank would see the
clams and mussels, and pebbles and gravel, and schools of fish swimming
about or staying still. Why is that? Because the water is unclouded. In
the same way, that a mendicant whose mind is not clouded would know
what's for their own good, the good of another, or the good of both; or
that they would realize any superhuman distinction in knowledge and
vision worthy of the noble ones: this is quite possible. Why is that?
Because their mind is unclouded."

47\. "Just as, mendicants, the boxwood is said to be the best kind of tree in
terms of its pliability and workability, so too, I do not see a single
thing that's as pliable and workable as the mind, when it is developed
and cultivated. A mind that is developed and cultivated is pliable and
workable."

<!--pg-->
48\. "Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that's as quick to change as
the mind. So much so that it's not easy to give a simile for how quickly
the mind changes."

<!--pg-->
49\. "This mind, mendicants, is radiant. But it's corrupted by passing
corruptions."

<!--pg-->
50\. "This mind, mendicants, is radiant. And it is freed from passing
corruptions."
