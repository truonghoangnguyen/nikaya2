# The Chapter at Wares Village


### N 4.1 Understood *Anubuddhasutta*

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in the
land of the Vajjis at Wares Village. There the Buddha addressed the
mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"Mendicants, due to not understanding and not penetrating four things,
both you and I have wandered and transmigrated for such a very long
time. What four? Noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom. These
noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom have been understood and
comprehended. Craving for continued existence has been cut off; the
conduit to rebirth is ended; now there'll be no more future lives."

That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to
say:

> "Ethics, immersion, and wisdom,\
> and the supreme freedom:\
> these things have been understood\
> by Gotama the renowned.
>
> And so the Buddha, having insight,\
> explained this teaching to the mendicants.\
> The teacher made an end of suffering,\
> seeing clearly, he is fully quenched."

### N 4.2 Fallen *Papatitasutta*

"Someone without four things is said to have 'fallen from this teaching
and training'. What four? Noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom.
Someone without these four things is said to have 'fallen from this
teaching and training'.

Someone with four things is said to be 'secure in this teaching and
training'. What four? Noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom.
Someone with these four things is said to be 'secure in this teaching
and training'.

> They fall, collapsed and fallen;\
> greedy, they return.\
> The work is done, the joyful is enjoyed,\
> happiness is found through happiness."

### N 4.3 Broken (1st) *Paṭhamakhatasutta*

"When a foolish, incompetent untrue person has four qualities they keep
themselves broken and damaged. They deserve to be blamed and criticized
by sensible people, and they create much wickedness. What four? Without
examining or scrutinizing, they praise those deserving of criticism, and
they criticize those deserving of praise. They arouse faith in things
that are dubious, and they don't arouse faith in things that are
inspiring. When a foolish, incompetent untrue person has these four
qualities they keep themselves broken and damaged. They deserve to be
blamed and criticized by sensible people, and they create much
wickedness.

When an astute, competent true person has four qualities they keep
themselves intact and unscathed. They don't deserve to be blamed and
criticized by sensible people, and they create much merit. What four?
After examining and scrutinizing, they criticize those deserving of
criticism, and they praise those deserving of praise. They don't arouse
faith in things that are dubious, and they do arouse faith in things
that are inspiring. When an astute, competent true person has these four
qualities they keep themselves intact and unscathed. They don't deserve
to be blamed and criticized by sensible people, and they create much
merit.

> When you praise someone worthy of criticism,\
> or criticize someone worthy of praise,\
> you choose bad luck with your own mouth:\
> you'll never find happiness that way.
>
> Bad luck at dice is a trivial thing,\
> if all you lose is your money\
> and all you own, even yourself.\
> What's really terrible luck\
> is to hate the holy ones.
>
> For more than two quinquadecillion years,\
> and another five quattuordecillion years,\
> a slanderer of noble ones goes to hell,\
> having aimed bad words and thoughts at them."

### N 4.4 Broken (2nd) *Dutiyakhatasutta*

"When a foolish, incompetent untrue person acts wrongly toward four
people they keep themselves broken and damaged. They deserve to be
blamed and criticized by sensible people, and they create much
wickedness. What four? Mother ... father ... a Realized One ... and a
disciple of a Realized One. When a foolish, incompetent untrue person
acts wrongly toward these four people they keep themselves broken and
damaged. They deserve to be blamed and criticized by sensible people,
and they create much wickedness.

### N 4.5 With the Stream *Anusotasutta*

"These four people are found in the world. What four? A person who goes
with the stream; a person who goes against the stream; a steadfast
person; and a brahmin who has crossed over and stands on the far shore.

And who is the person who goes with the stream? It's a person who takes
part in sensual pleasures and does bad deeds. This is called a person
who goes with the stream.

And who is the person who goes against the stream? It's a person who
doesn't take part in sensual pleasures or do bad deeds. They live the
full and pure spiritual life in pain and sadness, weeping, with tearful
faces. This is called a person who goes against the stream.

And who is the steadfast person? It's a person who, with the ending of
the five lower fetters, is reborn spontaneously. They're extinguished
there, and are not liable to return from that world. This is called a
steadfast person.

And who is a brahmin who has crossed over and stands on the far shore?
It's a person who realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by
wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their
own insight due to the ending of defilements. This is called a brahmin
who has crossed over and stands on the far shore.

These are the four people found in the world.

> All those people with unbridled sensuality,\
> not free of lust, enjoying sensual pleasures in this life:\
> again and again, they return to birth and old age;\
> those who go with the stream are sunk in craving.
>
> So the attentive in this life,\
> with mindfulness established,\
> don't take part in sensual pleasures and bad deeds.\
> In pain they'd give up sensual pleasures:\
> they call that person\
> 'one who goes against the stream'.
>
> Someone who's given up five corruptions,\
> a perfect trainee, not liable to decline,\
> who's mastered their mind,\
> with faculties immersed in samādhi,\
> that's called 'a steadfast person'.
>
> The sage who has comprehended all things,\
> high and low,\
> cleared them and ended them, so they are no more;\
> they've completed the spiritual journey,\
> and gone to the end of the world,\
> they're called 'one who has gone beyond'."

### N 4.6 A Little Learning *Appassutasutta*

"Mendicants, these four people are found in the world. What four? A
person may have:

1.  Little learning and not get the point of learning.

2.  Little learning but get the point of learning.

3.  Much learning but not get the point of learning.

4.  Much learning and get the point of learning.

And how has a person learned little and not got the point of learning?
It's when a person has learned little of the statements, mixed prose &
verse, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of
past lives, amazing stories, and elaborations. And with the little
they've learned, they understand neither the meaning nor the teaching,
nor do they practice in line with the teaching. That's how a person has
learned little and not got the point of learning.

And how has a person learned little but has got the point of learning?
It's when a person has learned little of the statements, mixed prose &
verse, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of
past lives, amazing stories, and elaborations. But with the little
they've learned, they understand the meaning and the teaching, and they
practice in line with the teaching. That's how a person has learned
little but has got the point of learning.

And how has a person learned much but hasn't got the point of learning?
It's when a person has learned much of the statements, mixed prose &
verse, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of
past lives, amazing stories, and elaborations. But even though they've
learned much, they understand neither the meaning nor the teaching, nor
do they practice in line with the teaching. That's how a person has
learned much but hasn't got the point of learning.

And how has a person learned much and has got the point of learning?
It's when a person has learned much of the statements, mixed prose &
verse, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of
past lives, amazing stories, and elaborations. And with the large amount
they've learned, they understand the meaning and the teaching, and they
practice in line with the teaching. That's how a person has learned much
and has got the point of learning.

These are the four people found in the world.

> If you don't learn much,\
> and aren't steady in ethics,\
> they'll criticize you on both counts,\
> for your ethics and your learning.
>
> If you don't learn much,\
> and you are steady in ethics,\
> they'll praise your ethical conduct,\
> since your learning has succeeded.
>
> If you learn much,\
> but aren't steady in ethics,\
> they'll criticize your ethical conduct,\
> for your learning hasn't succeeded.
>
> If you learn much,\
> and you are steady in ethics,\
> they'll praise you on both counts,\
> for your ethics and your learning.
>
> A wise disciple of the Buddha\
> who is learned and has memorized the teachings;\
> like a pendant of Black Plum River gold,\
> who is worthy to criticize them?\
> Even the gods praise them,\
> and by the Divinity, too, they're praised."

### N 4.7 Beautification *Sobhanasutta*

"Mendicants, these four who are competent, educated, assured, and
learned, who have memorized the teachings and practice in line with the
teachings, beautify the Saṅgha. What four? A monk, a nun, a
layman, and a laywoman.

These four who are competent, educated, assured, and learned, who have
memorized the teachings and practice in line with the teachings,
beautify the Saṅgha.

> Whoever is competent and assured,\
> learned, a memorizer of the teachings,\
> who lives in line with the teachings---\
> such a person is said to beautify the Saṅgha.
>
> A monk accomplished in ethics,\
> and a learned nun,\
> a faithful layman,\
> and a faithful laywoman, too:\
> these beautify the Saṅgha,\
> they are the beautifiers of the Saṅgha."

<!--pg-->
### N 4.8 Self-assured *Vesārajjasutta*

"Mendicants, a Realized One has four kinds of self-assurance. With these
he claims the bull's place, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and
turns the divine wheel. What four?

I see no reason for anyone---whether ascetic, brahmin, god,
Māra, or the Divinity, or anyone else in the world---to
legitimately scold me, saying: 'You claim to be a fully awakened Buddha,
but you don't understand these things.' Since I see no such reason, I
live secure, fearless, and assured.

I see no reason for anyone---whether ascetic, brahmin, god,
Māra, or the Divinity, or anyone else in the world---to
legitimately scold me, saying: 'You claim to have ended all defilements,
but you still have these defilements.' Since I see no such reason, I
live secure, fearless, and assured.

I see no reason for anyone---whether ascetic, brahmin, god,
Māra, or the Divinity, or anyone else in the world---to
legitimately scold me, saying: 'The acts that you say are obstructions
are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.' Since I see
no such reason, I live secure, fearless, and assured.

I see no reason for anyone---whether ascetic, brahmin, god,
Māra, or the Divinity, or anyone else in the world---to
legitimately scold me, saying: 'Though you teach that this teaching
leads to the goal of the complete ending of suffering, it doesn't lead
there for one who practices it.' Since I see no such reason, I live
secure, fearless, and assured.

A Realized One has these four kinds of self-assurance. With these he
claims the bull's place, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and
turns the divine wheel.

> The various grounds for criticism\
> that ascetics and brahmins rely on\
> vanish on reaching a Realized One,\
> assured, gone beyond grounds for criticism.
>
> He rolls forth the Wheel of Dhamma\
> as a consummate one,\
> complete, sympathetic for all living creatures.\
> Sentient beings revere him,\
> first among gods and humans,\
> who has gone beyond rebirth."

### N 4.9 The Arising of Craving *Taṇhuppādasutta*

"Mendicants, there are four things that give rise to craving in a
mendicant. What four? For the sake of robes, almsfood, lodgings, or
rebirth in this or that state.

These are the four things that give rise to craving in a mendicant.

> Craving is a person's partner\
> as they transmigrate on this long journey.\
> They go from this state to another,\
> but don't escape transmigration.
>
> Knowing this drawback---\
> that craving is the cause of suffering---\
> rid of craving, free of grasping,\
> a mendicant would wander mindful."

### N 4.10 Yokes *Yogasutta*

"Mendicants, there are these four yokes. What four? The yokes of sensual
pleasures, future lives, views, and ignorance.

And what is the yoke of sensual pleasures? It's when you don't truly
understand sensual pleasures' origin, ending, gratification, drawback,
and escape. So greed, relishing, affection, infatuation, thirst,
passion, attachment, and craving for sensual pleasures linger on inside.
This is called the yoke of sensual pleasures. Such is the yoke of
sensual pleasures.

And what is the yoke of future lives? It's when you don't truly
understand future lives' origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and
escape. So greed, relishing, affection, infatuation, thirst, passion,
attachment, and craving for continued existence linger on inside. This
is called the yoke of future lives. Such are the yokes of sensual
pleasures and future lives.

And what is the yoke of views? It's when you don't truly understand
views' origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape. So greed,
relishing, affection, infatuation, thirst, passion, attachment, and
craving for views linger on inside. This is called the yoke of views.
Such are the yokes of sensual pleasures, future lives, and views.

And what is the yoke of ignorance? It's when you don't truly understand
the six fields of contact's origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and
escape, so ignorance and unknowing of the six fields of contact linger
on inside. This is called the yoke of ignorance. Such are the yokes of
sensual pleasures, future lives, views, and ignorance. These are bad,
unskillful qualities that are corrupting, leading to future lives,
hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.
That's why someone yoked to them is called: 'one who has not found
sanctuary from the yoke'.

These are the four yokes.

There are these four kinds of unyoking. What four? Unyoking from sensual
pleasures, future lives, views, and ignorance.

And what is unyoking from sensual pleasures? It's when you truly
understand sensual pleasures' origin, ending, gratification, drawback,
and escape. So greed, relishing, affection, infatuation, thirst,
passion, attachment, and craving for sensual pleasures don't linger on
inside. This is called unyoking from sensual pleasures. Such is unyoking
from sensual pleasures.

And what is unyoking from future lives? It's when you truly understand
future lives' origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape. So
greed, relishing, affection, infatuation, thirst, passion, attachment,
and craving for continued existence don't linger on inside. This is
called unyoking from future lives. Such is unyoking from sensual
pleasures and future lives.

And what is unyoking from views? It's when you truly understand views'
origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape. So greed,
relishing, affection, infatuation, thirst, passion, attachment, and
craving for views don't linger on inside. This is called unyoking from
views. Such is unyoking from sensual pleasures, future lives, and views.

And what is unyoking from ignorance? It's when you truly understand the
six fields of contact's origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and
escape, so ignorance and unknowing of the six fields of contact don't
linger on inside. This is called unyoking from ignorance. Such is
unyoking from sensual pleasures, future lives, views, and ignorance.
These are bad, unskillful qualities that are corrupting, leading to
future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old
age, and death. That's why someone unyoked from them is called: 'one who
has found sanctuary from the yoke'.

These are the four kinds of unyoking.

> Yoked to both sensual pleasures\
> and the desire to be reborn in a future life;\
> yoked also to views,\
> and governed by ignorance,
>
> sentient beings continue to transmigrate,\
> with ongoing birth and death.\
> But those who fully understand sensual pleasures,\
> and the yoke to all future lives;
>
> with the yoke of views eradicated,\
> and ignorance dispelled,\
> unyoked from all yokes,\
> truly those sages have slipped their yoke."
