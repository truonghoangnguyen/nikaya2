# The Chapter on a Lay Follower

### AN 5.171 Timidity  *Sārajjasutta*

SO I HAVE HEARD. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's
monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, "Mendicants!"

"Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:

"A lay follower with five qualities is overcome by timidity. What five?
They kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, and
consume beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants. A lay follower with these
five qualities is overcome by timidity.

A lay follower with five qualities is self-assured. What five? They
don't kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or
consume beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants. A lay follower with these
five qualities is self-assured."

<!--pg-->
### AN 5.172 Assured  *Visāradasutta*

"A lay follower living at home with five qualities is not self-assured.
What five? They kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct,
lie, and consume beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants. A lay follower
living at home with these five qualities is not self-assured.

A lay follower living at home with these five qualities is self-assured.
What five? They don't kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual
misconduct, lie, or consume beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants. A lay
follower living at home with these five qualities is self-assured."

<!--pg-->
### AN 5.173 Hell  *Nirayasutta*

"Mendicants, a lay follower with five qualities is cast down to hell.
What five? They kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct,
lie, and consume beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants. A lay follower with
these five qualities is cast down to hell.

A lay follower with five qualities is raised up to heaven. What five?
They don't kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie,
or consume beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants. A lay follower with these
five qualities is raised up to heaven."

<!--pg-->
### AN 5.174 Threats  *Verasutta*

Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha,
bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:

"Householder, unless these five dangers and threats are given up, one is
said to be unethical, and is reborn in hell. What five? Killing living
creatures, stealing, committing sexual misconduct, lying, and consuming
beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants. Unless these five dangers and
threats are given up, one is said to be unethical, and is reborn in
hell.

Once these five dangers and threats are given up, one is said to be
ethical, and is reborn in heaven. What five? Killing living creatures,
stealing, committing sexual misconduct, lying, and consuming beer, wine,
and liquor intoxicants. Once these five dangers and threats are given
up, one is said to be ethical, and is reborn in heaven.

Anyone who kills living creatures creates dangers and threats both in
this life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness.
Anyone who refrains from killing living creatures creates no dangers and
threats either in this life or in lives to come, and doesn't experience
mental pain and sadness. So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone
who refrains from killing living creatures.

Anyone who steals ...

Anyone who commits sexual misconduct ...

Anyone who lies ...

Anyone who consumes beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants creates dangers
and threats both in this life and in lives to come, and experiences
mental pain and sadness. Anyone who refrains from consuming beer, wine,
and liquor intoxicants creates no dangers and threats either in this
life or in lives to come, and doesn't experience mental pain and
sadness. So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains
from consuming beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants.

> Take anyone in this world\
> who kills living creatures,\
> speaks falsely, steals,\
> commits adultery,\
> and indulges in drinking\
> beer and wine.
>
> Unless they give up these five threats,\
> they're said to be unethical.\
> When their body breaks up, that witless person\
> is reborn in hell.
>
> A person in the world doesn't kill living creatures,\
> speak falsely,\
> steal,\
> commit adultery,\
> or indulge in drinking\
> beer and wine.
>
> Giving up these five threats,\
> they're said to be ethical.\
> When their body breaks up, that wise person\
> is reborn in a good place."

### AN 5.175 Corpse-worker  *Caṇḍālasutta*

"Mendicants, a lay follower with five qualities is a corpse-worker, a
stain, and a reject among lay followers. What five? They're faithless.
They're unethical. They follow boisterous, superstitious rites,
believing in omens rather than deeds. They seek outside of the Buddhist
community for those worthy of religious donations. And they make
offerings there first. A lay follower with these five qualities is a
corpse-worker, a stain, and a reject among lay followers.

A lay follower with five qualities is a gem, a pink lotus, and a white
lotus among lay followers. What five? They're faithful. They're ethical.
They don't practice boisterous, superstitious rites, and believe in
deeds rather than omens. They don't seek outside of the Buddhist
community for those worthy of religious donations. And they don't make
offerings there first. A lay follower with these five qualities is a
gem, a pink lotus, and a white lotus among lay followers."

### AN 5.176 Rapture  *Pītisutta*

Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, escorted by around five
hundred lay followers, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one
side. The Buddha said to him:

"Householders, you have supplied the mendicant Saṅgha with
robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. But
you should not be content with just this much. So you should train like
this: 'How can we, from time to time, enter and dwell in the rapture of
seclusion?' That's how you should train."

When he said this, Venerable Sāriputta said to the Buddha,
"It's incredible, sir, it's amazing! How well said this was by the
Buddha: 'Householders, you have supplied the mendicant
Saṅgha with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and
supplies for the sick. But you should not be content with just this
much. So you should train like this: "How can we, from time to time,
enter and dwell in the rapture of seclusion?" That's how you should
train.'

At a time when a noble disciple enters and dwells in the rapture of
seclusion, five things aren't present in him. The pain and sadness
connected with sensual pleasures. The pleasure and happiness connected
with sensual pleasures. The pain and sadness connected with the
unskillful. The pleasure and happiness connected with the unskillful.
The pain and sadness connected with the skillful. At a time when a noble
disciple enters and dwells in the rapture of seclusion, these five
things aren't present in him."

"Good, good, Sāriputta! At a time when a noble disciple
enters and dwells in the rapture of seclusion, five things aren't
present in him. The pain and sadness connected with sensual pleasures.
The pleasure and happiness connected with sensual pleasures. The pain
and sadness connected with the unskillful. The pleasure and happiness
connected with the unskillful. The pain and sadness connected with the
skillful. At a time when a noble disciple enters and dwells in the
rapture of seclusion, these five things aren't present in him."

### AN 5.177 Trades  *Vaṇijjāsutta*

"Mendicants, a lay follower should not engage in these five trades. What
five? Trade in weapons, living creatures, meat, intoxicants, and
poisons. A lay follower should not engage in these five trades."

<!--pg-->
### AN 5.178 Kings  *Rājāsutta*

"What do you think, mendicants? Have you ever seen or heard of a person
who has given up killing living creatures, and the kings have them
arrested for that, and execute, imprison, or banish them, or do what the
case requires?"

"No, sir."

"Good, mendicants! I too have never seen or heard of such a thing.
Rather, the kings are informed of someone's bad deed: 'This person has
murdered a man or a woman.' The kings have them arrested for killing,
and execute, imprison, or banish them, or do what the case requires.
Have you ever seen or heard of such a case?"

"Sir, we have seen it and heard of it, and we will hear of it again."

"What do you think, mendicants? Have you ever seen or heard of a person
who has given up stealing, and the kings have them arrested for that
...?"

"No, sir."

"Good, mendicants! I too have never seen or heard of such a thing.
Rather, the kings are informed of someone's bad deed: 'This person took
something from a village or wilderness, with the intention to commit
theft.' The kings have them arrested for stealing ... Have you ever seen
or heard of such a case?"

"Sir, we have seen it and heard of it, and we will hear of it again."

"What do you think, mendicants? Have you ever seen or heard of a person
who has given up sexual misconduct, and the kings have them arrested for
that ...?"

"No, sir."

"Good, mendicants! I too have never seen or heard of such a thing.
Rather, the kings are informed of someone's bad deed: 'This person had
sexual relations with women or maidens under someone else's protection.'
The kings have them arrested for that ... Have you ever seen or heard of
such a case?"

"Sir, we have seen it and heard of it, and we will hear of it again."

"What do you think, mendicants? Have you ever seen or heard of a person
who has given up lying, and the kings have them arrested for that ...?"

"No, sir."

"Good, mendicants! I too have never seen or heard of such a thing.
Rather, the kings are informed of someone's bad deed: 'This person has
ruined a householder or householder's child by lying.' The kings have
them arrested for that ... Have you ever seen or heard of such a case?"

"Sir, we have seen it and heard of it, and we will hear of it again."

"What do you think, mendicants? Have you ever seen or heard of a person
who has given up beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants, and the kings have
them arrested for that, and execute, imprison, or banish them, or do
what the case requires?"

"No, sir."

"Good, mendicants! I too have never seen or heard of such a thing.
Rather, the kings are informed of someone's bad deed: 'While under the
influence of beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants, this person murdered a
woman or a man. Or they stole something from a village or wilderness. Or
they had sexual relations with women or maidens under someone else's
protection. Or they ruined a householder or householder's child by
lying.' The kings have them arrested for being under the influence of
beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants, and execute, imprison, or banish
them, or do what the case requires. Have you ever seen or heard of such
a case?"

"Sir, we have seen it and heard of it, and we will hear of it again."

### AN 5.179 A Layperson  *Gihisutta*

Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, escorted by around five
hundred lay followers, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one
side. Then the Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta:

"You should know this, Sāriputta, about those white-clothed
laypeople whose actions are restrained in the five precepts, and who get
four blissful meditations in this life belonging to the higher mind when
they want, without trouble or difficulty. They may, if they wish,
declare of themselves: 'I've finished with rebirth in hell, the animal
realm, and the ghost realm. I've finished with all places of loss, bad
places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I'm not liable to be
reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.'

And what are the five precepts in which their actions are restrained?
It's when a noble disciple doesn't kill living creatures, steal, commit
sexual misconduct, lie, or consume beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants.
These are the five precepts in which their actions are restrained.

And what are the four blissful meditations in this life belonging to the
higher mind that they get when they want, without trouble or difficulty?

It's when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha:
'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in
knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for
those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.'
This is the first blissful meditation in this life belonging to the
higher mind, which they achieve in order to purify the unpurified mind
and cleanse the unclean mind.

Furthermore, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the
teaching: 'The teaching is well explained by the Buddha---apparent in
the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant,
so that sensible people can know it for themselves.' This is the second
blissful meditation ...

Furthermore, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the
Saṅgha: 'The Saṅgha of the Buddha's disciples
is practicing the way that's good, sincere, systematic, and proper. It
consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the
Saṅgha of the Buddha's disciples that is worthy of
offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a
religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the
supreme field of merit for the world.' This is the third blissful
meditation ...

Furthermore, a noble disciple's ethical conduct is loved by the noble
ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised
by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. This is the
fourth blissful meditation in this life belonging to the higher mind,
which they achieve in order to purify the unpurified mind and cleanse
the unclean mind. These are the four blissful meditations in this life
belonging to the higher mind that they get when they want, without
trouble or difficulty.

You should know this, Sāriputta, about those white-clothed
laypeople whose actions are restrained in the five precepts, and who get
four blissful meditations in this life belonging to the higher mind when
they want, without trouble or difficulty. They may, if they wish,
declare of themselves: 'I've finished with rebirth in hell, the animal
realm, and the ghost realm. I've finished with all places of loss, bad
places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I'm not liable to be
reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.'

### AN 5.180 About Gavesī  *Gavesīsutta*

At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans
together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. While traveling
along a road the Buddha saw a large sal grove in a certain spot. He left
the road, went to the sal grove, and plunged deep into it. And at a
certain spot he smiled.

Then Venerable Ānanda thought, "What is the cause, what is the reason
why the Buddha smiled? Realized Ones do not smile for no reason."

So Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, "What is the cause, what is the
reason why the Buddha smiled? Realized Ones do not smile for no reason."

"Once upon a time, Ānanda, there was a city in this spot that was
successful and prosperous, populous, full of people. And Kassapa, a
blessed one, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, lived supported
by that city.

He had a lay follower called Gavesī who had not fulfilled
all the precepts. And the five hundred lay followers who were taught and
advised by Gavesī also had not fulfilled all the precepts.
Then Gavesī thought: 'I'm the helper, leader, and adviser
of these five hundred lay followers, yet neither I nor they have
fulfilled the precepts. We're the same, I'm in no way better. So let me
do better.'

Then Gavesī went to those five hundred lay followers and
said to them: 'From this day forth may the venerables remember me as one
who has fulfilled the precepts.' Then those five hundred lay followers
thought: 'Master Gavesī is our helper, leader, and adviser,
and now he will fulfill the precepts. Why don't we do the same?' Then
those five hundred lay followers went to Gavesī and said to
him: 'From this day forth may Master Gavesī remember these
five hundred lay followers as having fulfilled the precepts.'

Then Gavesī thought: 'I'm the helper, leader, and adviser
of these five hundred lay followers, and both I and they have fulfilled
the precepts. We're the same, I'm in no way better. So let me do
better.'

Then Gavesī went to those five hundred lay followers and
said to them: 'From this day forth may the venerables remember me as one
who is celibate, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex.' Then those
five hundred lay followers did the same. ...

Then Gavesī thought: 'These five hundred lay followers ...
are celibate, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex. We're the same,
I'm in no way better. So let me do better.'

Then Gavesī went to those five hundred lay followers and
said to them: 'From this day forth may the venerables remember me as one
who eats in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night, and
from food at the wrong time.' Then those five hundred lay followers did
the same. ...

Then Gavesī thought: 'These five hundred lay followers ...
eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night, and food at
the wrong time. We're the same, I'm in no way better. So let me do
better.'

Then the lay follower Gavesī went up to the blessed one
Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha and said to him:
'Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha's
presence?' And he received the going forth, the ordination in the
Buddha's presence. Not long after his ordination, the mendicant
Gavesī, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and
resolute, realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this
very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for
which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.

He understood: 'Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been
completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further
for this place.' And the mendicant Gavesī became one of the
perfected.

Then those five hundred lay followers thought: 'Master
Gavesī is our helper, leader, and adviser, He has shaved
off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and gone forth from the
lay life to homelessness. Why don't we do the same?' Then those five
hundred lay followers went up to the blessed one Kassapa, the perfected
one, the fully awakened Buddha and said to him: 'Sir, may we receive the
going forth and ordination in the Buddha's presence?' And they did
receive the going forth and ordination in the Buddha's presence.

Then the mendicant Gavesī thought: 'I get the supreme bliss
of freedom whenever I want, without trouble or difficulty. Oh, may these
five hundred mendicants do the same!' Then those five hundred
mendicants, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon
realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very
life. They lived having achieved with their own insight the goal for
which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.

They understood: 'Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been
completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further
for this place.'

And so, Ānanda, those five hundred mendicants headed by
Gavesī, trying to go higher and higher, better and better,
realized the supreme bliss of freedom. So you should train like this:
'Trying to go higher and higher, better and better, we will realize the
supreme bliss of freedom.' That's how you should train."
