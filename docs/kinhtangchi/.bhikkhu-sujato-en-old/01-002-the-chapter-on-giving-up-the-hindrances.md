khi đã sanh, chúng tăng trưởng và lớn mạnh.
chưa sanh sẽ sanh hay đã sanh thì tăng trưởng và lớn mạnh
chưa sanh sẽ không sanh hay đã sanh thì bị diệt

Ta không thấy một pháp nào khác ngăn không cho sân hận sanh khởi, hay khi đã sanh khởi thì đoạn trừ được nó
Ta không thấy một pháp nào khác đưa đến dục tham chưa sanh không sanh khởi và đã sanh được đoạn tận


Ta không thấy một pháp nào khác đưa đến sân hận chưa sanh sẽ không sanh hay đã sanh thì bị diệt
I do not see a single thing that prevents ill will from arising, or, when it has arisen, abandons it

# The Chapter on Giving Up the Hindrances

AN 1.11–20

_Nīvaraṇappahānavagga_

###### 11

“Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to sensual 1.1
desire, or, when it has arisen, makes it increase and grow like the
feature of beauty. When you apply the mind irrationally to the
feature of beauty, sensual desire arises, and once arisen it increases
and grows.”


###### 12

“Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to ill will, or, 1.1
when it has arisen, makes it increase and grow like the feature of
harshness. When you apply the mind irrationally to the feature of
harshness, ill will arises, and once arisen it increases and grows.”

###### 13

“Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to dullness 1.1
and drowsiness, or, when they have arisen, makes them increase
and grow like discontent, sloth, yawning, sleepiness after eating,
and mental sluggishness. When you have a sluggish mind, dullness
and drowsiness arise, and once arisen they increase and grow.”
###### 14

1.1 “Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to restlessness
and remorse, or, when they have arisen, makes them increase and
grow like an unsettled mind. When you have no peace of mind,
restlessness and remorse arise, and once arisen they increase and
grow.”

###### 15

1.1 “Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to doubt,
or, when it has arisen, makes it increase and grow like irrational
application of mind. When you apply the mind irrationally, doubt
arises, and once arisen it increases and grows.”

###### 16

1.1 “Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that prevents sensual desire
from arising, or, when it has arisen, abandons it like the feature
of ugliness. When you apply the mind rationally to the feature of
ugliness, sensual desire does not arise, or, if it has already arisen,
it’s given up.”

###### 17

1.1 “Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that prevents ill will from
arising, or, when it has arisen, abandons it like the heart’s release
by love. When you apply the mind rationally on the heart’s release
by love, ill will does not arise, or, if it has already arisen, it’s given
up.”

###### 18

1.1 “Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that prevents dullness and
drowsiness from arising, or, when they have arisen, gives them
up like the elements of initiative, persistence, and vigor. When
you re energetic, dullness and drowsiness do not arise, or, if they ve
already arisen, they’re given up.”

###### 19

“Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that prevents restlessness 1.1
and remorse from arising, or, when they have arisen, gives them up
like peace of mind. When your mind is peaceful, restlessness and
remorse do not arise, or, if they’ve already arisen, they’re given up.”

###### 20

“Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that prevents doubt from 1.1
arising, or, when it has arisen, gives it up like rational application of
mind. When you apply the mind rationally, doubt does not arise,
or, if it’s already arisen, it’s given up.”
