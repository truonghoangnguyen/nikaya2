to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share. These
are the three grounds by which a person with faith and confidence

harmlessness, restraint, and self-control;

##### Characteristics of the Conditioned

_Saṅkhatalakkhaṇasutta_

three? Arising is evident, vanishing is evident, and change while

conditioned.”
###### Characteristics of the Unconditioned

No arising is evident, no vanishing is evident, and no change while

unconditioned.”

AN 3.48
##### The King of Mountains

_Pabbatarājasutta_

“Mendicants, great sal trees grow in three ways supported by the 1.1
Himalayas, the king of mountains. What three? The branches,
leaves, and foliage; the bark and shoots; and the softwood and
heartwood. Great sal trees grow in these three ways supported by
the Himalayas, the king of mountains.
In the same way, a family grows in three ways supported by a 2.1
family head with faith. What three? Faith, ethics, and wisdom. A
family grows in these three ways supported by a family head with
faith.

Supported by the rocky mountain 3.1
in the wilds, the formidable forest,
the tree grows
to become lord of the forest.

So too, when the family head 4.1
is ethical and faithful,
supported by them, they grow:
children, partners, and kin,
colleagues, relatives,
and those dependent for their livelihood.

Seeing the ethical conduct of the virtuous, 5.1
the generosity and good deeds,
those who see clearly
do likewise.

6.1 Having practiced the teaching here,
the path that goes to a good place,
they delight in the heavenly realm,
enjoying all the pleasures they desire.”

AN 3.49
##### Keen

_Ātappakaraṇīyasutta_

1.1 “In three situations, mendicants, you should be keen. What three?
You should be keen to prevent bad, unskillful qualities from arising.
You should be keen to give rise to skillful qualities. And you should
be keen to endure physical pain—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant,
disagreeable, life-threatening. In these three situations, you should
be keen.
2.1 It’s a mendicant who is keen to prevent bad, unskillful qualities
from arising. They’re keen to give rise to skillful qualities. And
they’re keen to endure physical pain—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, life-threatening. This is called a mendicant who
is keen, alert, and mindful so as to rightly make an end of suffering.”

##### A Master Thief

_Mahācorasutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, a master thief with three factors breaks into houses,
plunders wealth, steals from isolated buildings, and commits highway robbery. What three?
1.3 A master thief relies on uneven ground, on thick cover, and on
powerful individuals. And how does a master thief rely on uneven
ground? It’s when a master thief relies on inaccessible riverlands
or rugged mountains. Thats how a master thief relies on uneven
ground.
And how does a master thief rely on thick cover? It’s when a 2.1
master thief relies on thick grass, thick trees, a blind spot, or a large
forest grove. That’s how a master thief relies on thick cover.
And how does a master thief rely on powerful individuals? It’s 3.1
when a master thief relies on rulers or their chief ministers. They
think: ‘If anyone accuses me of anything, these rulers or their
chief ministers will speak in my defense in the case.’ And that’s
exactly what happens. That’s how a master thief relies on powerful
individuals.
A master thief with these three factors breaks into houses, plun- 3.7
ders wealth, steals from isolated buildings, and commits highway
robbery.
In the same way, when a bad mendicant has three factors, they 4.1
keep themselves broken and damaged. They deserve to be blamed
andcriticizedbysensiblepeople,andtheycreatemuchwickedness.
What three?
A bad mendicant relies on uneven ground, on thick cover, and 4.3
on powerful individuals.
And how does a bad mendicant rely on uneven ground? It’s 5.1
when a bad mendicant has unethical conduct by way of body,
speech, and mind. That’s how a bad mendicant relies on uneven
ground.
And how does a bad mendicant rely on thick cover? It’s when a 6.1
bad mendicant has wrong view, he’s attached to an extremist view.
That’s how a bad mendicant relies on thick cover.
And how does a bad mendicant rely on powerful individuals? 7.1
It’s when a bad mendicant relies on rulers or their chief ministers.
They think: ‘If anyone accuses me of anything, these rulers or
their chief ministers will speak in my defense in the case.’ And
that’s exactly what happens. That’s how a bad mendicant relies on
powerful individuals.
7.7 When abadmendicanthasthesethreequalities, theykeepthem
selves broken and damaged. They deserve to be blamed and criticized by sensible people, and they create much wickedness.”
