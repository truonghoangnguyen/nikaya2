# The Chapter on Awakening

AN 3.103
##### Before Awakening

_Pubbevasambodhasutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened
but intent on awakening—I thought: ‘What’s the gratification in
the world? What’s the drawback? What’s the escape?’
1.3 Then it occurred to me: ‘The pleasure and happiness that arise
from the world: this is its gratification.
1.5 That the world is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this
is its drawback.
1.6 Removing and giving up desire and greed for the world: this is
its escape.’
1.7 As long as I didn’t truly understand the world’s gratification,
drawback, and escape in this way for what they are, I didn’t announce my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods,
Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.
1.8 But when I did truly understand the world’s gratification, drawback, and escape in this way for what they are, I announced my
supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and
Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods
and humans.
1.9 Knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘My freedom is unshakable;
this is my last rebirth; now there’ll be no more future lives.’”
AN 3.104
##### Gratification (1st)

_Paṭhamaassādasutta_

“Mendicants, I went in search of the world’s gratification, and I 1.1
found it. I’ve seen clearly with wisdom the full extent of gratification in the world. I went in search of the world’s drawbacks,
and I found them. I’ve seen clearly with wisdom the full extent of
the drawbacks in the world. I went in search of escape from the
world, and I found it. I’ve seen clearly with wisdom the full extent
of escape from the world.
As long as I didn’t truly understand the world’s gratification, 1.7
drawback, and escape for what they are, I didn’t announce my
supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and
Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods
and humans.
But when I did truly understand the world’s gratification, draw- 1.8
back, and escape for what they are, I announced my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Divinities,
this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.
Knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘My freedom is unshakable; 1.9
this is my last rebirth; now there’ll be no more future lives.’”

AN 3.105
##### Gratification (2nd)

_Dutiyaassādasutta_

“Mendicants, if there were no gratification in the world, sentient 1.1
beings wouldn’t be aroused by it. But because there is gratification
in the world, sentient beings are aroused by it.
If the world had no drawback, sentient beings wouldn’t grow 1.3
disillusioned with it. But since the world has a drawback, sentient
beings do grow disillusioned with it.
1.5 If there were no escape from the world, sentient beings wouldn t
escape from it. But since there is an escape from the world, sentient
beings do escape from it.
1.7 As long as sentient beings don’t truly understand the world’s
gratification, drawback, and escape for what they are, they haven’t
escaped from this world—with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this
population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—
and they don’t live detached, liberated, with a mind free of limits.
1.8 But when sentient beings truly understand the world’s gratification, drawback, and escape for what they are, they’ve escaped from
this world—with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population
with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—and they
live detached, liberated, with a mind free of limits.”

AN 3.106
##### Ascetics and Brahmins

_Samaṇabrāhmaṇasutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, there are ascetics and brahmins who don’t truly understand the world’s gratification, drawback, and escape for what
they are. I don’t deem them as true ascetics and brahmins. Those
venerables don’t realize the goal of life as an ascetic or brahmin,
and don’t live having realized it with their own insight.
1.3 There are ascetics and brahmins who do truly understand the
world’s gratification, drawback, and escape for what they are. I
deem them as true ascetics and brahmins. Those venerables realize
the goal of life as an ascetic or brahmin, and live having realized it
with their own insight.”
AN 3.107
##### Wailing

_Ruṇṇasutta_

“Singing is regarded as wailing in the training of the Noble One. 1.1
Dancing is regarded as madness. Too much laughter, showing the
teeth, is regarded as childish. So break off singing and dancing; and
when you’re appropriately pleased, it’s enough to simply smile.”

AN 3.108
##### Satisfaction

_Atittisutta_

“Mendicants, there are three indulgences that never satisfy. What 1.1
three? Sleep, drinking beerand wine, andsexual intercourse. These
are the three indulgences that never satisfy.”

AN 3.109
##### Unprotected

_Arakkhitasutta_

Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, 1.1
bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:
“Householder, when the mind is unprotected, deeds of body, 1.2
speech, and mind are unprotected. When deeds are unprotected,
they fester. When deeds fester, they become rotten. Someone
whose deeds of body, speech, and mind are rotten will not have a
good death.
It’s like a bungalow with a bad roof. The roof peak, rafters, and 2.1
walls are unprotected. They fester, and become rotten.
In the same way, when the mind is unprotected, bodily, verbal, 3.1
and mental deeds are unprotected. … Someone whose deeds of
body, speech, and mind are rotten will not have a good death.
4.1 When the mind is protected, bodily, verbal, and mental deeds
are protected. When deeds are protected, they don’t fester. When
deeds don’t fester, they don’t become rotten. Someone whose
deeds of body, speech, and mind aren’t rotten will have a good
death.
5.1 It’s like a bungalow with a good roof. The roof peak, rafters, and
walls are protected. They don’t get soaked, and they don’t become
rotten.
6.1 In the same way, when the mind is protected, bodily, verbal, and
mental deeds are protected. … Someone whose deeds of body,
speech, and mind aren’t rotten will have a good death.”

AN 3.110
##### Fallen

_Byāpannasutta_

1.1 Seated to one side, the Buddha said to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika:
1.2 “Householder, when the mind is fallen, bodily, verbal, and mental deeds are fallen. Someone whose deeds of body, speech, and
mind are fallen will not have a good death. It’s like a bungalow with
a bad roof. The roof peak, rafters, and walls fall in. In the same way,
when the mind is fallen, bodily, verbal, and mental deeds are fallen.
Someone whose deeds of body, speech, and mind are fallen will
not have a good death.
2.1 When the mind is not fallen, bodily, verbal, and mental deeds
are not fallen. Someone whose deeds of body, speech, and mind
are not fallen will have a good death. It’s like a bungalow with a
good roof. The roof peak, rafters, and walls are not fallen in. In the
same way, when the mind is not fallen, bodily, verbal, and mental
deeds are not fallen. Someone whose deeds of body, speech, and
mind are not fallen will have a good death.”

##### Sources (1st)

_Paṭhamanidānasutta_

“Mendicants, there are these three sources that give rise to deeds. 1.1
What three? Greed, hate, and delusion are sources that give rise to
deeds. Any deed that emerges from greed, hate, or delusion—
born, sourced, and originated from greed, hate, or delusion—
is unskillful, blameworthy, results in suffering, and leads to the
creation of more deeds, not their cessation. These are three sources
that give rise to deeds.
There arethesethreesourcesthatgiverisetodeeds. Whatthree? 2.1
Contentment, love, and understanding are sources that give rise to
deeds. Any deed that emerges from contentment, love, or understanding—born, sourced, and originated from contentment, love,
or understanding—is skillful, blameless, results in happiness, and
leads to the cessation of more deeds, not their creation. These are
three sources that give rise to deeds.”

AN 3.112
##### Sources (2nd)

_Dutiyanidānasutta_

“Mendicants, there are these three sources that give rise to deeds. 1.1
What three?
Desire comes up for things that stimulate desire and greed in the 1.3
past, future, or present. And how does desire come up for things
that stimulate desire and greed in the past, future, or present? In
yourheartyouthinkaboutandconsiderthingsthatstimulatedesire
and greed in the past, future, or present. When you do this, desire
comes up, and you get attached to those things. This lust in the
heart is what I call a fetter. That’s how desire comes up for things
that stimulate desire and greed in the past, future, or present.
These are three sources that give rise to deeds. 3.1
4.1 There arethesethreesourcesthatgiverisetodeeds. Whatthree?
Desire doesn’t come up for things that stimulate desire and greed in
the past, future, or present. And how does desire not come up for
thingsthatstimulatedesireandgreedinthepast, future, orpresent?
You understand the future result of things that stimulate desire and
greed in the past, future, or present. When you know this, you
grow disillusioned, your heart becomes dispassionate, and you see
it with penetrating wisdom. That’s how desire doesn’t come up for
things that stimulate desire and greed in the past, future, or present.
7.1 These are three sources that give rise to deeds.”
