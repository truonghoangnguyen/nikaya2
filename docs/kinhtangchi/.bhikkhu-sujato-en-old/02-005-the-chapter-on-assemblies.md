1.1 “There are, mendicants, these two assemblies. What two? A shallow
assemblyandadeepassembly. Andwhatisashallowassembly? An
assembly where the mendicants are restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness
and immersion, with straying minds and undisciplined faculties.
This is called a shallow assembly.
2.1 And what is a deep assembly? An assembly where the mendicants are not restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, or loose-tongued,
but have established mindfulness, situational awareness, immersion, unified minds, and restrained faculties. This is called a deep
assembly. These are the two assemblies. The better of these two
assemblies is the deep assembly.”

###### 43

1.1 “There are, mendicants, these two assemblies. What two? A divided
assembly and a harmonious assembly. And what is a divided assembly? An assembly where the mendicants argue, quarrel, and
dispute, continually wounding each other with barbed words. This
is called a divided assembly.
And what is a harmonious assembly? An assembly where the 2.1
mendicants live in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with
kindly eyes. This is called a harmonious assembly. These are the
two assemblies. The better of these two assemblies is the harmonious assembly.”

###### 44

“There are, mendicants, these two assemblies. What two? An as- 1.1
sembly of the worst and an assembly of the best. And what is an
assembly of the worst? An assembly where the senior mendicants
are indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion, not rousing energy for attaining the unattained, achieving
the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized. Those who come
after follow their example. They too become indulgent and slack,
leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion, not rousing energy for
attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing
the unrealized. This is called an assembly of the worst.
And what is an assembly of the best? An assembly where the 2.1
senior mendicants are not indulgent or slack, nor are they backsliders; instead, they take the lead in seclusion, rousing energy for
attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing
the unrealized. Those who come after follow their example. They
too are not indulgent or slack, nor are they backsliders; instead,
they take the lead in seclusion, rousing energy for attaining the
unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.
This is called an assembly of the best. These are the two assemblies.
The better of these two assemblies is the assembly of the best.”

###### 45

“There are, mendicants, these two assemblies. What two? An ig- 1.1
noble assembly and a noble assembly. And what is an ignoble
assembly? An assembly where the mendicants don’t truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This
is the cessation of suffering … This is the practice that leads to
the cessation of suffering’. This is called an ignoble assembly.
2.1 And what is a noble assembly? An assembly where the mendicants truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin
of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the
practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. This is called a
noble assembly. These are the two assemblies. The better of these
two assemblies is the noble assembly.”

###### 46

1.1 “There are, mendicants, these two assemblies. What two? An assembly of the dregs and an assembly of the cream. And what is
an assembly of the dregs? An assembly where the mendicants
make decisions prejudiced by favoritism, hostility, stupidity, and
cowardice. This is called an assembly of the dregs.
2.1 And what is an assembly of the cream? An assembly where the
mendicants make decisions unprejudiced by favoritism, hostility,
stupidity, and cowardice. This is called an assembly of the cream.
These are the two assemblies. The better of these two assemblies is
the assembly of the cream.”

###### 47

1.1 “There are, mendicants, these two assemblies. What two? An assembly educated in fancy talk, not in questioning, and an assembly
educatedin questioning, not infancy talk. And whatis anassembly
educated in fancy talk, not in questioning? It is an assembly where,
when discourses spoken by the Realized One—deep, profound,
transcendent, dealing with emptiness—are being recited the mendicants do not want to listen. They don’t actively listen or try to
understand, nor do they think those teachings are worth learning and memorizing. But when discourses composed by poets—
poetry, with fancy words and phrases, composed by outsiders or
spoken by disciples—are being recited the mendicants do want to
listen. They actively listen and try to understand, and they think
those teachings are worth learning and memorizing. But when
they’ve memorized those teachings they don’t question or examineeachother,saying: ‘Whydoesitsaythis? Whatdoesthatmean?’
So they don’t clarify what is unclear, or reveal what is obscure, or
dispel doubt regarding the many doubtful matters. This is called
an assembly educated in fancy talk, not in questioning.
And what is an assembly educated in questioning, not in fancy 2.1
talk? It is an assembly where, when discourses composed by poets—poetry, with fancy words and phrases, composed by outsiders
or spoken by disciples—are being recited the mendicants do not
want to listen. They don’t actively listen or try to understand, nor
do they think those teachings are worth learning and memorizing. But when discourses spoken by the Realized One—deep,
profound, transcendent, dealing with emptiness—are being recited the mendicants do want to listen. They actively listen and try
to understand, and they think those teachings are worth learning
and memorizing. And when they’ve memorized those teachings
they question and examine each other, saying: ‘Why does it say
this? What does that mean?’ So they clarify what is unclear, reveal
what is obscure, and dispel doubt regarding the many doubtful
matters. This is called an assembly educated in questioning, not in
fancy talk. These are the two assemblies. The better of these two
assemblies is the assembly educated in questioning, not in fancy
talk.”

###### 48

“There are, mendicants, these two assemblies. What two? An as- 1.1
sembly that values things of the flesh, not the true teaching, and
an assembly that values the true teaching, not things of the flesh.
And what is an assembly that values things of the flesh, not the true
teaching? It is an assembly where the mendicants praise each other
in front of the white-clothed laypeople, saying: ‘The mendicant
so-and-so is freed both ways; so-and-so is freed by wisdom; soand-so is a direct witness; so-and-so is attained to view; so-and-so
is freed by faith; so and so is a follower of teachings; so and so is a
follower by faith; so-and-so is ethical, of good character; so-and-so
is unethical, of bad character.’ They thereby acquire material things.
And when they get these things, they use them tied, infatuated, attached, blind to the drawbacks, and not understanding the escape.
This is called an assembly that values things of the flesh, not the
true teaching.
2.1 And what is an assembly that values the true teaching, not things
of the flesh? It is an assembly where the mendicants don’t praise
each other in front of the white-clothed laypeople, saying: ‘The
mendicant so-and-so is freed both ways; so-and-so is freed by wisdom; so-and-so is a direct witness; so-and-so is attained to view;
so-and-so is freed by faith; so-and-so is a follower of teachings;
so-and-so is a follower by faith; so-and-so is ethical, of good character; so-and-so is unethical, of bad character.’ They thereby acquire
material things. And when they get these things, they use them
untied, uninfatuated, unattached, seeing the drawbacks, and understanding the escape. This is called an assembly that values the
true teaching, not things of the flesh. These are the two assemblies.
The better of these two assemblies is the assembly that values the
true teaching, not things of the flesh.”

1.1 “There are, mendicants, these two assemblies. What two? An unjust
assembly and a just assembly. And what is an unjust assembly?
An assembly where legal acts against the teaching proceed, while
legal acts in line with the teaching don’t proceed. Legal acts against
the training proceed, while legal acts in line with the training don’t
proceed. Legal acts against the teaching are explained, while legal
acts in line with the teaching aren’t explained. Legal acts against
the training are explained, while legal acts in line with the training
aren’t explained. This is called an unjust assembly.
2.1 And what is a just assembly? An assembly where legal acts in
line with the teaching proceed, while legal acts against the teaching
don t proceed. Legal acts in line with the training proceed, while
legal acts against the training don’t proceed. Legal acts in line with
the teaching are explained, while legal acts against the teaching
aren’t explained. Legal acts in line with the training are explained,
while legal acts against the training aren’t explained. This is called
a just assembly. These are the two assemblies. The better of these
two assemblies is the just assembly.”

“There are, mendicants, these two assemblies. What two? An un- 1.1
principled assembly and a principled assembly … The better of
these two assemblies is the principled assembly.”

###### 51

“There are, mendicants, these two assemblies. What two? An as- 1.1
sembly with unprincipled speech, and an assembly with principled
speech. And what is an assembly with unprincipled speech? It
is an assembly where the mendicants take up disciplinary issues,
whether legitimate or not. But they don’t persuade each other
or allow themselves to be persuaded, nor do they convince each
other or allow themselves to be convinced. Unable to persuade
or convince each other, they can’t let go of their opinions. They
obstinately stick to that disciplinary issue, insisting that: ‘This is
the only truth, anything else is futile.’ This is called an assembly
with unprincipled speech.
And what is an assembly with principled speech? It is an as- 2.1
sembly where the mendicants take up disciplinary issues, whether
legitimate or not. Then they persuade each other or allow themselves to be persuaded, and they convince each other or allow
themselves to be convinced. Since they are able to persuade and
convince each other, they let go of their opinions. They don’t obstinately stick to that disciplinary issue or insist that: ‘This is the
only truth, anything else is futile.’ This is called an assembly with
principled speech. These are the two assemblies. The better of
these two assemblies is the assembly with principled speech.”
