# The Chapter on Fools

AN 3.1
##### Perils

_Bhayasutta_

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near 1.1
Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the
Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 1.5
“Whatever dangersthereare, allcomefromthefoolish, notfrom 2.1
the astute. Whatever perils there are, all come from the foolish,
not from the astute. Whatever hazards there are, all come from
the foolish, not from the astute. It’s like a fire that spreads from a
hut made of reeds or grass, and burns down even a bungalow, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with doors fastened and windows
shuttered. In the same way, whatever dangers there are, all come
from the foolish, not from the astute. Whatever perils there are,
all come from the foolish, not from the astute. Whatever hazards
there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.
So, the fool is dangerous, but the astute person is safe. The fool 3.1
is perilous, but the astute person is not. The fool is hazardous, but
the astute person is not. There’s no danger, peril, or hazard that
comes from the astute.
So you should train like this: ‘We will reject the three things by 4.1
which a fool is known, and we will undertake and follow the three
things by which an astute person is known. Thats how you should
train.”

AN 3.2
##### Characteristics

_Lakkhaṇasutta_

1.1 “A fool is characterized by their deeds, and an astute person is characterized by their deeds, for wisdom is made beautiful when it is
evident. A fool is known by three things. What three? Bad conduct
by way of body, speech, and mind.
1.5 These are the three things by which a fool is known.
2.1 An astute person is known by three things. What three? Good
conduct by way of body, speech, and mind.
2.4 These are the three things by which an astute person is known.
3.1 So you should train like this: ‘We will reject the three things by
which a fool is known, and we will undertake and follow the three
things by which an astute person is known.’ That’s how you should
train.”

AN 3.3
##### Thinking

_Cintīsutta_

1.1 “There are these three characteristics, signs, and manifestations of
a fool. What three? A fool thinks poorly, speaks poorly, and acts
poorly. If a fool didn’t think poorly, speak poorly, and act poorly,
then how would the astute know of them: ‘This fellow is a fool, an
untrue person’? But since a fool does think poorly, speak poorly,
and act poorly, then the astute do know of them: ‘This fellow is a
fool, an untrue person’. These are the three characteristics, signs,
and manifestations of a fool.
2.1 There are these three characteristics, signs, and manifestations
of an astute person. What three? An astute person thinks well,
speaks well, and acts well. If an astute person didn t think well,
speak well, and act well, then how would the astute know of them:
‘This fellow is astute, a true person’? But since an astute person
does think well, speak well, and act well, then the astute do know
of them: ‘This fellow is astute, a true person’. These are the three
characteristics, signs, and manifestations of an astute person. So
you should train …”

AN 3.4
##### Mistakes

_Accayasutta_

“A fool is known by three things. What three? They don’t recognize 1.1
when they’ve made a mistake. When they do recognize it they
don’t deal with it properly. And when someone else confesses a
mistake to them, they don’t accept it properly.
These are the three things by which a fool is known. 1.4
An astute person is known by three things. What three? They 2.1
recognize when they’ve made a mistake. When they recognize it
they deal with it properly. And when someone else confesses a
mistake to them, they accept it properly.
These are the three things by which an astute person is known. 2.4
So you should train …”

AN 3.5
##### Irrational

_Ayonisosutta_

“A fool is known by three things. What three? They ask a question ir- 1.1
rationally. They answer a question irrationally. And when someone
else answers a question rationally—with well-rounded, coherent,
and relevant words and phrases—they disagree with it.
These are the three things by which a fool is known. 1.4
2.1 An astutepersonisknownbythreethings. Whatthree? Theyask
a question rationally. They answer a question rationally. And when
someone else answers a question rationally—with well-rounded,

way of body, speech, and mind.

AN 3.7
##### Blameworthy

by way of body, speech, and mind. … An astute person is known
by blameless deeds by way of body, speech, and mind. …”

AN 3.8
##### Hurtful

_Sabyābajjhasutta_

1.1 “A fool is known by three things. What three? Hurtful deeds by way
of body, speech, and mind. … An astute person is known by kind
deeds by way of body, speech, and mind. These are the three things
by which an astute person is known.
So you should train like this: ‘We will reject the three qualities 2.1
by which a fool is known, and we will undertake and follow the
three qualities by which an astute person is known.’ That’s how
you should train.”

AN 3.9
##### Broken

_Khatasutta_

“When a foolish, incompetent, untrue person has three qualities 1.1
they keep themselves broken and damaged. They deserve to be
blamed and criticized by sensible people, and they create much
wickedness. What three? Bad conduct by way of body, speech,
and mind.
When a foolish, incompetent untrue person has these three 1.4
qualities they keep themselves broken and damaged. They deserve
to be blamed and criticized by sensible people, and they create
much wickedness.
When an astute, competent true person has three qualities they 2.1
keep themselves intact and unscathed. They don’t deserve to be
blamed and criticized by sensible people, and they create much
merit. What three? Good conduct by way of body, speech, and
mind.
When an astute, competent true person has these three qualities 2.4
they keep themselves intact and unscathed. They don’t deserve to
be blamed and criticized by sensible people, and they create much
merit.”
AN 3.10
