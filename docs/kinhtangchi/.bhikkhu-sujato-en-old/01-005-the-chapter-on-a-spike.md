# The Chapter on a Spike

AN 1.41–50

_Paṇihitaacchavagga_

###### 41

1.1 “Mendicants, suppose a spike of rice or barley was pointing the
wrong way. If you trod on it with hand or foot, it is impossible for
it to break the skin and produce blood. Why is that? Because the
spike is pointing the wrong way. In the same way, it is quite impossible for a mendicant whose mind is pointing the wrong way to
break ignorance, produce knowledge, and realize extinguishment.
Why is that? Because their mind is pointing the wrong way.”

1.1 “Mendicants, suppose a spike of rice or barley was pointing the right
way. Ifyoutrodonitwithhandorfoot, it’spossibleitmaybreakthe
skin and produce blood. Why is that? Because the spike is pointing
the right way. In the same way, it is quite possible for a mendicant
whose mind is pointing the right way to break ignorance, produce
knowledge, and realize extinguishment. Why is that? Because the
mind is pointing the right way.”

###### 43

1.1 “Mendicants, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person whose
mind is corrupted, I understand: ‘If this person were to die right
now, they would be cast down to hell. Why is that? Because their
mind is corrupted. Corruption of mind is the reason why some
sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn
in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.”

###### 44

“Mendicants, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person whose 1.1
mind is pure, I understand: ‘If this person were to die right now,
they would be raised up to heaven.’ Why is that? Because their
mind is pure. Purity of mind is the reason why some sentient
beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good
place, a heavenly realm.”

###### 45

“Suppose, mendicants, there was a lake that was cloudy, murky, and 1.1
muddy. A person with clear eyes standing on the bank would not
see the clams and mussels, and pebbles and gravel, and schools
of fish swimming about or staying still. Why is that? Because
the water is clouded. In the same way, that a mendicant whose
mind is clouded would know what’s for their own good, the good
of another, or the good of both; or that they would realize any
superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the
noble ones: this is quite impossible. Why is that? Because their
mind is clouded.”

###### 46

“Suppose, mendicants, there was a lake that was transparent, clear, 1.1
and unclouded. A person with clear eyes standing on the bank
would see the clams and mussels, and pebbles and gravel, and
schools of fish swimming about or staying still. Why is that? Because the water is unclouded. In the same way, that a mendicant
whose mind is not clouded would know what’s for their own good,
the good of another, or the good of both; or that they would realize
any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of
the noble ones: this is quite possible. Why is that? Because their
mind is unclouded.”

###### 47

1.1 “Just as, mendicants, the boxwood is said to be the best kind of
tree in terms of its pliability and workability, so too, I do not see a
single thing that’s as pliable and workable as the mind, when it is
developed and cultivated. A mind that is developed and cultivated
is pliable and workable.”

###### 48

1.1 “Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that’s as quick to change
as the mind. So much so that it’s not easy to give a simile for how
quickly the mind changes.”

###### 49

1.1 “This mind, mendicants, is radiant. But it’s corrupted by passing
corruptions.”

###### 50

1.1 “This mind, mendicants, is radiant. And it is freed from passing
corruptions.”
