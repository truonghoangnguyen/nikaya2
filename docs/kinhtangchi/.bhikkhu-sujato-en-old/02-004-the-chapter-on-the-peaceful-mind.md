# The Chapter on the Peaceful Mind

AN 2.32–41

_Samacittavagga_

###### 32

“Mendicants, I will teach you the level of the untrue person and the 1.1
level of the true person. Listen and apply your mind well, I will
speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 1.3
“What is the level of the untrue person? The untrue person is 2.1
ungrateful and thankless, for the wicked only know how to be ungrateful and thankless. It is totally the level of an untrue person to
be ungrateful and thankless. The true person is grateful and thankful, for the virtuous only know how to be grateful and thankful. It
is totally the level of a true person to be grateful and thankful.”

###### 33

“Mendicants, I say that these two people cannot easily be repaid. 1.1
What two? Mother and father.
You would not have done enough to repay your mother and fa- 1.4
ther even if you were to carry your mother around on one shoulder
and your father on the other, and if you lived like this for a hundred
years, and if you were to anoint, massage, bathe, and rub them; and
even if they were to defecate and urinate right there.
1.6 Even if you were to establish your mother and father as supreme
monarchs of this great earth, abounding in the seven treasures,
you would still not have done enough to repay them. Why is that?
Parents are very helpful to their children: they raise them, nurture
them, and show them the world.
1.9 But you have done enough, more than enough, to repay them
if you encourage, settle, and ground unfaithful parents in faith,
unethical parents in ethical conduct, stingy parents in generosity,
or ignorant parents in wisdom.”

1.1 Then a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged
greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation
were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, “What
does Mister Gotama teach? What does he explain?”
1.3 “Brahmin, I teach action and inaction.”
1.4 “But in what way does Mister Gotama teach action and inaction?”
2.1 “I teach inaction regarding bad bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, and the many kinds of unskillful things. I teach action regarding good bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, and the many
kinds of skillful things. This is the kind of action and inaction that
I teach.”
3.1 “Excellent, Mister Gotama! … From this day forth, may Mister
Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge
for life.”

###### 35

1.1 Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha,
bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha, “How many
in the world are worthy of a religious donation? And where should
a gift be given?”
Householder, there are two in the world who are worthy of a 1.3
religious donation: the trainee and the adept. These two in the
world are worthy of a religious donation, and that’s where you
should give a gift.”
That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, 2.1
went on to say:

“In this world, the trainee and the adept, 3.1
are worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods.
They are sincere in body,
speech, and mind.
This is the field for sponsors of sacrifice—
what’s given here is very fruitful.”

###### 36

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near 1.1
Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī 1.3
in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery.
There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants: “Reverends, mendicants!”
“Reverend,” they replied. Sāriputta said this: 1.6
“I will teach you about a person fettered internally and one fet- 1.8
tered externally. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”
“Yes, reverend,” they replied. Sāriputta said this: 1.10
“Who is a person fettered internally? It’s a mendicant who is 2.1
ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves
well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the
slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. When their
body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in one of the orders of
gods. When they pass away from there, they’re a returner, who
comes back to this place. This is called a person who is fettered
internally, a returner, who comes back to this place.
Who is a person fettered externally? It’s a mendicant who is 3.1
ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves
well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the
slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. They enter
and remain in a certain peaceful state of freed mind. When their
body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in one of the orders of
gods. When they pass away from there, they’re a non-returner, not
coming back to this place. This is called a person who is fettered
externally, a non-returner, who does not come back to this place.
4.1 Furthermore, a mendicant is ethical … they keep the rules
they’ve undertaken. They simply practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding sensual pleasures. They simply
practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding
future lives. They practice for the ending of craving. They practice
for the ending of greed. When their body breaks up, after death,
they are reborn in one of the orders of gods. When they pass away
from there, they are non-returners, not coming back to this place.
This is called a person who is fettered externally, a non-returner,
who does not come back to this place.”
5.1 Then several peaceful-minded deities went up to the Buddha,
bowed, stood to one side, and said to the Buddha, “Sir, Venerable
Sāriputta is in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern
Monastery, where he is teaching the mendicants about a person
with internal fetters and one with external fetters. The assembly is
overjoyed! Sir, please go to Venerable Sāriputta out of sympathy.”
The Buddha consented with silence.
5.6 Then the Buddha, as easily as a strong person would extend or
contract their arm, vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in
the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery, in
front of Sāriputta. He sat on the seat spread out. Sāriputta bowed
to the Buddha and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:
6.1 “Just now, Sāriputta, several peaceful-minded deities came up
to me, bowed, and stood to one side. Those deities said to me: ‘Sir,
Venerable Sāriputta is in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in
the Eastern Monastery, where he is teaching the mendicants about
a person with internal fetters and one with external fetters. The
assembly is overjoyed! Sir, please go to Venerable Sāriputta out of
sympathy.’
Those deities, though they number ten, twenty, thirty, forty, 6.5
fifty, or sixty, can stand on the point of a needle without bumping
up against each other.
Sāriputta, you might think: ‘Surely those deities, since so many 6.6
of them can stand on the point of a needle without bumping up
against each other, must have developed their minds in that place.’
But you should not see it like this. It was right here that those
deities developed their minds.
So you should train like this: ‘We shall have peaceful faculties 6.10
and peaceful minds.’ That’s how you should train. When your
faculties and mind are peaceful, your acts of body, speech, and
mind will be peaceful, thinking: ‘We shall present the gift of peace
to our spiritual companions.’ That’s how you should train.
Those wanderers of other religions, Sāriputta, who have not 6.16
heard this exposition of the teaching are lost.”

###### 37

So I have heard. At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was 1.1
staying at Varaṇā, on the bank of the Kaddama Lake.
Then the brahmin Ārāmadaṇḍa went up to Mahākaccāna, and 1.3
exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite
conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Mahākaccāna:
“What is the cause, Mister Kaccāna, what is the reason why 1.5
aristocrats fight with aristocrats, brahmins fight with brahmins,
and householders fight with householders?”
“It is because of their insistence on sensual desire, their shack- 1.6
les, avarice, and attachment, that aristocrats fight with aristocrats,
brahmins fight with brahmins, and householders fight with householders.”
“What is the cause, Mister Kaccāna, what is the reason why 2.1
ascetics fight with ascetics?”
2.2 It is because of their insistence on views, their shackles, avarice,
and attachment, that ascetics fight with ascetics.”
3.1 “Mister Kaccāna, is there anyone in the world who has gone beyond the insistence on sensual desire and the insistence on views?”
3.2 “There is, brahmin.”
4.1 “Who in the world has gone beyond the insistence on sensual
desire and the insistence on views?”
4.2 “In the eastern lands there is a city called Sāvatthī. There the
Blessed One is now staying, the perfected one, the fully awakened
Buddha. He, brahmin, has gone beyond the insistence on sensual
desire and the insistence on views.”
5.1 When this was said, the brahmin Ārāmadaṇḍa got up from his
seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee,
raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and expressed this
heartfelt sentiment three times:
6.1 “Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!
7.1 Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!
8.1 Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!
9.1 He who has gone beyond the insistence on sensual desire and
the insistence on views.
10.1 Excellent, Mister Kaccāna! Excellent! As if he were righting the
overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to
the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes
can see what’s there, Mister Kaccāna has made the teaching clear
in many ways. I go for refuge to Mister Gotama, to the teaching,
and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Mister
Kaccāna remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge
for life.”
###### 38

At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying near Madhurā, in 1.1
Gunda’s Grove.
Then the brahmin Kandarāyana went up to Mahākaccāna, and 1.2
exchanged greetings with him … He sat down to one side and said
to Mahākaccāna:
“I have heard, Mister Kaccāna, that the ascetic Kaccāna doesn’t 1.3
bow to old brahmins, the elderly and senior, who are advanced in
years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in
their presence or offer them a seat. And this is indeed the case,
for the ascetic Kaccāna does not bow to old brahmins, elderly and
senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage
of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat. This
is not appropriate, Mister Kaccāna.”
“There is the stage of an elder and the stage of youth as explained 2.1
by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the
fully awakened Buddha. If an elder, though eighty, ninety, or a
hundred years old, still dwells in the midst of sensual pleasures,
enjoying them, consumed by thoughts of them, burning with fever
for them, and eagerly seeking more, they are reckoned as a child,
notasenior. Ifayouth, young, withpristineblackhair, blessedwith
youth, in the prime of life, does not dwell in the midst of sensual
pleasures, enjoying them, consumed by thoughts of them, burning
with fever for them, and eagerly seeking more, they are reckoned
as astute, a senior.”
When this was said, the brahmin Kandarāyana got up from his 3.1
seat, placed his robe over one shoulder, and bowed with his head at
the feet of the young mendicants, saying, “The good sirs are elders,
at the stage of the elder; we are youths, at the stage of youth.
Excellent, Mister Kaccāna! … From this day forth, may Mister 4.1
Kaccāna remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge
for life.”

1.1 “At a time when bandits are strong, kings are weak. Then the king
is not at ease when going out or coming back or when touring the
provinces. The brahmins and householders, likewise, are not at
ease when going out or coming back, or when inspecting their business activities. In the same way, at a time when bad mendicants are
strong, good-hearted mendicants are weak. Then the good-hearted
mendicants continually adhere to silence in the midst of the Saṅgha, or they stay in the borderlands. This is for the detriment and
suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm, detriment,
and suffering of gods and humans.
2.1 At a time when kings are strong, bandits are weak. Then the
king is at ease when going out or coming back or when inspecting
the provinces. The brahmins and householders, likewise, are at
ease when going out or coming back, or when inspecting their
business activities. In the same way, at a time when good-hearted
mendicants are strong, bad mendicants are weak. Then the bad
mendicants continually adhere to silence in the midst of the Saṅgha, or they leave for some place or other. This is for the welfare
and happiness of the people, for the people, for the benefit, welfare,
and happiness of gods and humans.”

1.1 “Mendicants, I don’t praise wrong practice for these two, for laypeople and renunciates. Because of wrong practice, neither laypeople
nor renunciates succeed in completing the system of the skillful
teaching.
2.1 I praise right practice for these two, for laypeople and renunciates. Because of right practice, both laypeople and renunciates
succeed in completing the system of the skillful teaching.”
###### 41

“Mendicants, by memorizing the discourses incorrectly, taking only 1.1
a semblance of the phrasing, some mendicants shut out the meaning and the teaching. They act for the detriment and suffering of
the people, against the people, for the harm, detriment, and suffering of gods and humans. They create much wickedness and make
the true teaching disappear.
But by memorizing the discourses well, not taking only a sem- 2.1
blance of the phrasing, some mendicants reinforce the meaning
and the teaching. They act for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods
and humans. They create much merit and make the true teaching
continue.”
