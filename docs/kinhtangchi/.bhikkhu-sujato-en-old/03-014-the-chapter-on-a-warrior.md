# The Chapter on a Warrior

AN 3.133
##### A Warrior

_Yodhājīvasutta_

“Mendicants, a warrior with three factors is worthy of a king, fit to 1.1
serve a king, and is reckoned as a factor of kingship. What three?
He’s a long-distance shooter, a marksman, one who shatters large
objects. A warrior with these three factors is worthy of a king, fit
to serve a king, and is reckoned as a factor of kingship.
In the same way, a mendicant with three factors is worthy of 1.5
offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a
religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and
is the supreme field of merit for the world. What three? They’re
a long-distance shooter, a marksman, and one who shatters large
objects.
And how is a mendicant a long-distance shooter? It’s when 2.1
a mendicant truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or
present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior;
far or near: all form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine,
I am not this, this is not my self.’ They truly see any kind of feeling
at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle;
inferior or superior; far or near: all feeling—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ They truly
see any kind of perception at all—past, future, or present; internal
or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: all
perception with right understanding: This is not mine, I am not
this, this is not my self.’ They truly see any kind of choices at all—
past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior
or superior; far or near: all choices—with right understanding:
‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ They truly see
any kind of consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal
or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near, all consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not
this, this is not my self.’ That’s how a mendicant is a long-distance
shooter.
3.1 And how is a mendicant a marksman? It’s when a mendicant
truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice
that leads to the cessation of suffering’. That’s how a mendicant is a
marksman.
4.1 And how does a mendicant shatter large objects? It’s when
a mendicant shatters the great mass of ignorance. That’s how a
mendicant shatters large objects.
4.4 A mendicantwiththesethreequalitiesisworthyofofferingsdedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme
field of merit for the world.”

AN 3.134
##### Assemblies

_Parisāsutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, there are these three assemblies. What three? An
assembly educated in fancy talk, an assembly educated in questioning, and an assembly educated to the fullest extent. These are the
three assemblies.”
AN 3.135
##### A Friend

_Mittasutta_

“Mendicants, you should associate with a friend who has three fac- 1.1
tors. What three? They give what is hard to give, they do what is
hard to do, and they bear what is hard to bear. You should associate
with a friend who has these three factors.”

AN 3.136
##### Arising

_Uppādāsutta_

“Mendicants, whether Realized Ones arise or not, this law of nature 1.1
persists, this regularity of natural principles, this invariance of natural principles: all conditions are impermanent. A Realized One
understands this and comprehends it, then he explains, teaches,
asserts, establishes, clarifies, analyzes, and reveals it: ‘All conditions
are impermanent.’
Whether Realized Ones arise or not, this law of nature persists, 1.6
this regularity of natural principles, this invariance of natural principles: all conditions are suffering. A Realized One understands this
and comprehends it, then he explains, teaches, asserts, establishes,
clarifies, analyzes, and reveals it: ‘All conditions are suffering.’
Whether Realized Ones arise or not, this law of nature persists, 1.11
this regularity of natural principles, this invariance of natural principles: all things are not-self. A Realized One understands this
and comprehends it, then he explains, teaches, asserts, establishes,
clarifies, analyzes, and reveals it: ‘All things are not-self.’”
AN 3.137
##### A Hair Blanket

_Kesakambalasutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, a hair blanket is said to be the worst kind of woven
cloth. It’s cold in the cold, hot in the heat, ugly, smelly, and unpleasant to touch. In the same way, the teaching of the bamboo-staffed
ascetic is said to be the worst of all the doctrines of the various
ascetics and brahmins.
2.1 The bamboo-staffed ascetic, that silly man, has this doctrine and
view: ‘There is no power in deeds, action, or energy.’
2.3 Now, all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who
lived in the past taught the efficacy of deeds, action, and energy.
But the bamboo-staffed ascetic opposes them by saying: ‘There is
no power in deeds, action, or energy.’
2.6 All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who will live
in the future will teach the efficacy of deeds, action, and energy.
But the bamboo-staffed ascetic opposes them by saying: ‘There is
no power in deeds, action, or energy.’
2.9 I too, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha in the
present, teach the efficacy of deeds, action, and energy. But the
bamboo-staffed ascetic opposes me by saying: ‘There is no power
in deeds, action, or energy.’
3.1 It’s like a trap set at the mouth of a river, which would bring
harm, suffering, calamity, and disaster for many fish. In the same
way that futile man the bamboo-staffed ascetic is a trap for humans,
it seems to me. He has come into the world for the harm, suffering,
calamity, and disaster of many beings.”
AN 3.138
##### Accomplishment

_Sampadāsutta_

“Mendicants, there are three accomplishments. What three? Ac- 1.1
complishment in faith, ethics, and wisdom. These are the three
accomplishments.”

AN 3.139
##### Growth

_Vuddhisutta_

“Mendicants, there are three kinds of growth. What three? Growth 1.1
in faith, ethics, and wisdom. These are the three kinds of growth.”

AN 3.140
##### A Wild Colt

_Assakhaḷuṅkasutta_

“Mendicants, I will teach you about three wild colts and three wild 1.1
people. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 1.3
“What are the three wild colts? One wild colt is fast, but not 2.1
beautiful or well proportioned. Another wild colt is fast and beautiful, but not well proportioned. While another wild colt is fast,
beautiful, and well proportioned.
These are the three wild colts. 2.5
And what are the three wild people? One wild person is fast, 3.1
but not beautiful or well proportioned. Another wild person is
fast and beautiful, but not well proportioned. While another wild
person is fast, beautiful, and well proportioned.
And how is a wild person fast, but not beautiful or well propor- 4.1
tioned? It’s when a mendicant truly understands: ‘This is suffering’
… This is the origin of suffering … This is the cessation of suffer
ing’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
This is how they’re fast, I say. But when asked a question about
the teaching or training, they falter without answering. This is how
they’re not beautiful, I say. And they don’t receive robes, almsfood,
lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. This is how
they’re not well proportioned, I say. This is how a wild person is
fast, but not beautiful or well proportioned.
5.1 And how is a wild person fast and beautiful, but not well proportioned? It’s when a mendicant truly understands: ‘This is suffering’
… ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
This is how they’re fast, I say. When asked a question about the
teaching or training, they answer without faltering. This is how
they’re beautiful, I say. But they don’t receive robes, almsfood,
lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. This is how
they’re not well proportioned, I say. This is how a wild person is
fast and beautiful, but not well proportioned.
6.1 And how is a wild person fast, beautiful, and well proportioned?
It’s when a mendicant truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ …
‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’
… ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
This is how they’re fast, I say. When asked a question about the
teaching or training, they answer without faltering. This is how
they’re beautiful, I say. They receive robes, almsfood, lodgings,
and medicines and supplies for the sick. This is how they’re well
proportioned, I say. This is how a wild person is fast, beautiful, and
well proportioned.
6.9 These are the three wild people.”
AN 3.141
##### Excellent Horses

_Assaparassasutta_

“Mendicants, I will teach you the three excellent horses and the 1.1
three excellent people. Listen and apply your mind well, I will
speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 1.3
“What arethethreeexcellenthorses? Oneexcellenthorseisfast, 2.1
but not beautiful or well proportioned. Another excellent horse
is fast and beautiful, but not well proportioned. While another
excellent horse is fast, beautiful, and well proportioned.
These are the three excellent horses. 2.5
“What are the three excellent people? One excellent person 3.1
is fast, but not beautiful or well proportioned. Another excellent
person is fast and beautiful, but not well proportioned. While
another excellent person is fast, beautiful, and well proportioned.
And howisanexcellentpersonfast, butnotbeautifulorwellpro- 4.1
portioned? It’s when a mendicant, with the ending of the five lower
fetters, is reborn spontaneously. They’re extinguished there, and
are not liable to return from that world. This is how they’re fast, I
say. But when asked a question about the teaching or training, they
falter without answering. This is how they’re not beautiful, I say.
And they don’t receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines
andsuppliesforthesick. Thisishowthey’renotwellproportioned,
I say. This is how an excellent person is fast, but not beautiful or
well proportioned.
And how is an excellent person fast and beautiful, but not well 5.1
proportioned? It’s when a mendicant, with the ending of the five
lower fetters, is reborn spontaneously. They’re extinguished there,
andarenotliabletoreturnfromthatworld. Thisishowthey’refast,
I say. When asked a question about the teaching or training, they
answer without faltering. This is how they’re beautiful, I say. But
they don’t receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and
supplies for the sick. This is how they re not well proportioned, I
say. This is how an excellent person is fast and beautiful, but not
well proportioned.
6.1 And how is an excellent person fast, beautiful, and well proportioned? It’s when a mendicant, with the ending of the five lower
fetters, is reborn spontaneously. They’re extinguished there, and
are not liable to return from that world. This is how they’re fast, I
say. When asked a question about the teaching or training, they
answer without faltering. This is how they’re beautiful, I say. They

an excellent person is fast, beautiful, and well proportioned.
6.9 These are the three excellent people.”

AN 3.142
##### The Thoroughbred

_Assājānīyasutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, I will teach you the three fine thoroughbred horses,
and the three fine thoroughbred people. Listen and apply your
mind well, I will speak.”
1.3 “Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:
2.1 “What are the three fine thoroughbred horses? One fine thoroughbred horse … is fast, beautiful, and well proportioned.
2.4 These are the three fine thoroughbred horses.
3.1 And what are the three fine thoroughbred people? One fine
thoroughbred person … is fast, beautiful, and well proportioned.
4.1 And how is a fine thoroughbred person … fast, beautiful, and
well proportioned? It’s when a mendicant realizes the undefiled
freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they
live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of
defilements. This is how they’re fast, I say. When asked a question
about the teaching or training, they answer without faltering. This
is how they’re beautiful, I say. They receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. This is how they re
well proportioned, I say. This is how a fine thoroughbred person is
fast, beautiful, and well proportioned.
These are the three fine thoroughbred people.” 4.10

##### At the Peacocks’ Feeding Ground (1st)

_Paṭhamamoranivāpasutta_

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, at the 1.1
monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks’ feeding ground.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 1.4
“Mendicants, a mendicant with three qualities has reached the 2.1
ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate
spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are the best among gods and
humans. What three? The entire spectrum of an adept’s ethics,
immersion, and wisdom.
A mendicant with these three qualities has reached the ultimate 2.4
end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual
life, the ultimate goal. They are the best among gods and humans.”

demonstration of revealing, and a demonstration of instruction.
A mendicant with these three qualities has reached the ultimate 1.4
end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual
