1.1 So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the
Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”
1.5 “Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:
2.1 “Mendicants, I do not see a single sight that occupies a man’s
mind like the sight of a woman. The sight of a woman occupies a
man’s mind.”

1.1 “Mendicants, I do not see a single sound that occupies a man’s mind
like the sound of a woman. The sound of a woman occupies a man’s
