# The Chapter on a Lump of Salt

AN 3.92
##### Urgent

_Accāyikasutta_

“Mendicants, a farmer has three urgent duties. What three? A 1.1
farmer swiftly makes sure the field is well ploughed and tilled.
Next they swiftly plant seeds in season. When the time is right,
they swiftly irrigate or drain the field. These are the three urgent
duties of a farmer. That farmer has no special power or ability to
say: ‘Let the crops germinate today! Let them flower tomorrow!
Let them ripen the day after!’ But there comes a time when that
farmer’s crops germinate, flower, and ripen as the seasons change.
In the same way, a mendicant has three urgent duties. What 2.1
three? Undertaking the training in the higher ethics, the higher
mind, and the higher wisdom. These are the three urgent duties
of a mendicant. That mendicant has no special power or ability
to say: ‘Let my mind be freed from defilements by not grasping
today! Or tomorrow! Or the day after!’ But there comes a time—
as that mendicant trains in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and
the higher wisdom—that their mind is freed from defilements by
not grasping.
3.1 So you should train like this: We will have keen enthusiasm for
undertaking the training in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and
the higher wisdom.’ That’s how you should train.”

AN 3.93
##### Seclusion

_Pavivekasutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, wanderers of other religions advocate three kinds of
seclusion. What three? Seclusion in robes, almsfood, and lodgings.
2.1 Wanderers of other religions advocate this kind of seclusion
in robes. They wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpsewrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in
strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair,
or owls’ wings. This is what wanderers of other religions advocate
for seclusion in robes.
3.1 Wanderers of other religions advocate this kind of seclusion in
almsfood. They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce,
rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung.
They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit. This
is what the wanderers of other religions advocate for seclusion in
almsfood.
4.1 Wanderers of other religions advocate this kind of seclusion in
lodgings. They stay in a wilderness, at the root of a tree, in a charnel
ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw, or a threshing-hut.
This is what wanderers of other religions advocate for seclusion in
lodgings. These are the three kinds of seclusion that wanderers of
other religions advocate.
5.1 In this teaching and training, there are three kinds of seclusion
for a mendicant. What three? Firstly, a mendicant is ethical, giving
up unethical conduct, being secluded from it. They have right
view, giving up wrong view, being secluded from it. They’ve ended
defilements, giving up defilements, being secluded from them.
Whenamendicanthasthesethreekindsofseclusion, they’recalled
a mendicant who has reached the peak and the pith, being pure
and consolidated in the core.
When a farmer’s rice field is ripe, they’d have the rice cut swiftly, 6.1
gathered swiftly, transported swiftly, made into heaps swiftly,
threshed swiftly, the straw removed swiftly, winnowed swiftly,
brought over swiftly, pounded swiftly, and have the husks removed
swiftly. In this way that farmer’s crop would reach the peak and the
pith, being pure and consolidated in the core.
In the same way, when a mendicant is ethical, giving up uneth- 7.1
ical conduct, being secluded from it; when they have right view,
giving up wrong view, being secluded from it; when they’ve ended
defilements, giving up defilements, being secluded from them:
they’re called a mendicant who has reached the peak and the pith,
being pure and consolidated in the core.”

AN 3.94
##### Autumn

_Saradasutta_

“In the autumn, the heavens are clear and cloudless. And as the 1.1
sun is rising to the firmament, having dispelled all the darkness of
space, it shines and glows and radiates.
In the same way, when the stainless, immaculate vision of the 2.1
teaching arises in a noble disciple, three fetters are given up: substantialist view, doubt, and misapprehension of precepts and observances.
Afterwards they get rid of two things: covetousness and ill will. 3.1
Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful
qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has
the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and
keeping it connected. If that noble disciple passed away at that
time, they’re bound by no fetter that might return them to this
world.”
AN 3.95
##### Assemblies

_Parisāsutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, these are the three assemblies. What three? An assembly of the best, a divided assembly, and a harmonious assembly.
2.1 And what is an assembly of the best? An assembly where the
senior mendicants are not indulgent or slack, nor are they backsliders. Instead, they take the lead in seclusion, rousing energy
for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized. And those who come afterwards follow their
example. They too are not indulgent or slack, nor are they backsliders. Instead, they take the lead in seclusion, rousing energy for
attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing
the unrealized. This is called an assembly of the best.
3.1 And what is a divided assembly? An assembly where the mendicants argue, quarrel, and dispute, continually wounding each other
with barbed words. This is called a divided assembly.
4.1 And what is a harmonious assembly? An assembly where the
mendicants live in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with
kindly eyes. This is called a harmonious assembly.
5.1 When themendicantsliveinharmonylikethis,theycreatemuch
merit. At that time the mendicants live in a divine dwelling, that
is, the heart’s release by rejoicing. When they’re joyful, rapture
springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes
tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when
they’re blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.
6.1 It’s like when the heavens rain heavily on a mountain top, and
the water flows downhill to fill the hollows, crevices, and creeks.
As they become full, they fill up the pools. The pools fill up the
lakes, the lakes fill up the streams, and the streams fill up the rivers.
And as the rivers become full, they fill up the ocean.
In the same way, when the mendicants are in harmony, appre 7.1
ciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes, they create much
merit. At that time the mendicants live in a divine dwelling, that
is, the heart’s release by rejoicing. When they’re joyful, rapture
springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes
tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when
they’re blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.
These are the three assemblies.” 7.4

##### The Thoroughbred (1st)

_Paṭhamaājānīyasutta_

“Mendicants, a fine royal thoroughbred with three factors is worthy 1.1
of a king, fit to serve a king, and reckoned as a factor of kingship.
Whatthree? It’swhenafineroyalthoroughbredisbeautiful,strong,
and fast. A fine royal thoroughbred with these three factors is
worthy of a king. …
In the same way, a mendicant with three qualities is worthy of 1.5
offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a
religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is
the supreme field of merit for the world. What three? It’s when a
mendicant is beautiful, strong, and fast.
And how is a mendicant beautiful? It’s when a mendicant is 2.1
ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves
well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the
slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. That’s how
a mendicant is beautiful.
And howisamendicantstrong? It’swhenamendicantliveswith 3.1
energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing
skillful qualities. They are strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking
off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. That’s how a
mendicant is strong.
4.1 And how is a mendicant fast? Its when a mendicant truly un
derstands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ …
‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads
to the cessation of suffering’. That’s how a mendicant is fast.
4.7 A mendicantwiththesethreequalitiesisworthyofofferingsdedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme

of a king, fit to serve a king, and considered a factor of kingship.
Whatthree? It’swhenafineroyalthoroughbredisbeautiful,strong,

the supreme field of merit for the world. What three? It’s when a
mendicant is beautiful, strong, and fast.
2.1 And how is a mendicant beautiful? It’s when a mendicant is
ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves
well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the
slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. That’s how
a mendicant is beautiful.
3.1 And howisamendicantstrong? It’swhenamendicantliveswith
energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing
skillful qualities. They are strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking
off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. That’s how a
mendicant is strong.
And how is a mendicant fast? Its when a mendicant, with the 4.1
ending of the five lower fetters, is reborn spontaneously. They’re
extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.
That’s how a mendicant is fast.
A mendicantwiththesethreequalitiesisworthyofofferingsded- 4.4
icated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme
field of merit for the world.”

undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very
life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to
the ending of defilements. That’s how a mendicant is fast.

AN 3.99
##### Jute

_Potthakasutta_

1.1 “Jute canvas is ugly, unpleasant to touch, and worthless whether
it’s new, worn in, or worn out. They use worn out jute canvas for
scrubbing pots, or else they just throw it away on the rubbish heap.
2.1 In the same way, if a junior mendicant is unethical, of bad character, this is how they’re ugly, I say. That person is just as ugly
as jute canvas. If you associate with, accompany, and attend to
that person, following their example, it’ll be for your lasting harm
and suffering. This is how they’re unpleasant to touch, I say. That
person is just as unpleasant to touch as jute canvas. Any robes,
almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick that
they receive are not very fruitful or beneficial for the donor. This
is how they’re worthless, I say. That person is just as worthless as
jute canvas.
2.10 If a middle mendicant is unethical, of bad character, this is how
they’re ugly, I say. …
2.11 If a senior mendicant is unethical, of bad character, this is how
they’re ugly, I say. … If you associate with, accompany, and attend
to that person, following their example, it’ll be for your lasting
harm and suffering. …
3.1 If such a senior mendicant speaks among the Saṅgha, the mendicants say: ‘What’s an incompetent fool like you got to say? How
on earth could you imagine you ve got something worth saying!
That person becomes angry and upset, and blurts out things that
make the Saṅgha throw them out, as if they were throwing jute
canvas away on the rubbish heap.
Cloth from Kāsi is beautiful, pleasant to touch, and valuable 4.1
whether it’s new, worn in, or worn out. They use worn out cloth
from Kāsi for wrapping, or else they place it in a fragrant casket.
In the same way, if a junior mendicant is ethical, of good char- 5.1
acter, this is how they’re beautiful, I say. That person is just as
beautiful as cloth from Kāsi. If you associate with, accompany,
and attend to such a person, following their example, it will be for
your lasting welfare and happiness. This is how they’re pleasant to
touch, I say. That person is just as pleasant to touch as cloth from
Kāsi. Any robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies
for the sick that they receive are very fruitful and beneficial for the
donor. This is how they’re valuable, I say. That person is just as
valuable as cloth from Kāsi.
If a middle mendicant is ethical, of good character, this is how 5.9
they’re beautiful, I say. …
If a senior mendicant is ethical, of good character, this is how 5.10
they’re beautiful, I say. …
If such a senior mendicant speaks in the midst of the Saṅgha, 6.1
the mendicants say: ‘Venerables, be quiet! The senior mendicant
is speaking on the teaching and training.’
So you should train like this: ‘We will be like cloth from Kāsi, 6.4
not like jute canvas.’ That’s how you should train.”

AN 3.100
##### A Lump of Salt

_Loṇakapallasutta_

“Mendicants, suppose you say: ‘No matter how this person per- 1.1
forms a deed, they experience it the same way.’ This being so, the
spiritual life could not be lived, and thered be no chance of making
a complete end of suffering.
1.3 Suppose you say: ‘No matter how this person performs a deed,
they experience the result as it should be experienced.’ This being
so, the spiritual life can be lived, and there is a chance of making a
complete end of suffering.
1.5 Take thecaseofapersonwhodoesatrivialbaddeed, butitlands
them in hell. Meanwhile, another person does the same trivial bad
deed, but experiences it in this life, without even a bit left over, let
alone a lot.
2.1 What kind of person does a trivial bad deed, but it lands them
in hell? A person who hasn’t developed their physical endurance,
ethics, mind, or wisdom. They’re small-minded and mean-spirited,
living in suffering. That kind of person does a trivial bad deed, but
it lands them in hell.
3.1 What kind of person does the same trivial bad deed, but experiences it in this life, without even a bit left over, let alone a lot? A
person who has developed their physical endurance, ethics, mind,
and wisdom. They’re not small-minded, but are big-hearted, living
without limits. That kind of person does the same trivial bad deed,
but experiences it in this life, without even a bit left over, not to
speak of a lot.
4.1 Suppose a person was to drop a lump of salt into a mug of water.
What do you think, mendicants? Would that mug of water become
salty and undrinkable?”
4.4 “Yes, sir. Why is that? Because there is only a little water in the
bowl.”
4.7 “Suppose a person was to drop a lump of salt into the Ganges
river. What do you think, mendicants? Would the Ganges river
become salty and undrinkable?”
4.10 “No, sir. Why is that? Because the Ganges river is a vast mass of
water.”
5.1 “This is how it is in the case of a person who does a trivial bad
deed, but it lands them in hell. Meanwhile, another person does
the same trivial bad deed, but experiences it in this life, without
even a bit left over, not to speak of a lot. …
Take the case of a person who is thrown in jail for stealing half a 8.1
dollar, a dollar, or a hundred dollars. While another person isn’t
thrown in jail for stealing half a dollar, a dollar, or a hundred dollars.
What kind of person is thrown in jail for stealing half a dollar, 9.1
a dollar, or a hundred dollars? A person who is poor, with few
possessions and little wealth. That kind of person is thrown in jail
for stealing half a dollar, a dollar, or a hundred dollars.
What kind of person isn’t thrown in jail for stealing half a dollar, 10.1
a dollar, or a hundred dollars? A person who is rich, affluent, and
wealthy. That kind of person isn’t thrown in jail for stealing half a
dollar, a dollar, or a hundred dollars.
This is how it is in the case of a person who does a trivial bad 10.4
deed, but they go to hell. Meanwhile, another person does the
same trivial bad deed, but experiences it in this life, without even a
bit left over, not to speak of a lot. …
It’s like a sheep dealer or butcher. They can execute, jail, fine, 13.1
or otherwise punish one person who steals from them, but not
another.
What kind of person can they punish? A person who is poor, 14.1
with few possessions and little wealth. That’s the kind of person
they can punish.
What kind of person can’t they punish? A ruler or their chief 15.1
ministerwhoisrich, affluent, andwealthy. That’sthekindofperson
they can’t punish. In fact, all they can do is raise their joined palms
and ask: ‘Please, good sir, give me my sheep or pay me for it.’
This is how it is in the case of a person who does a trivial bad 15.6
deed, but it lands them in hell. Meanwhile, another person does
the same trivial bad deed, but experiences it in this life, without
even a bit left over, not to speak of a lot. …
Mendicants, suppose you say: ‘No matter how this person per- 18.1
forms a deed, they experience it the same way.’ This being so, the
spiritual life could not be lived, and there’d be no chance of making
a complete end of suffering.
18.3 Suppose you say: No matter how this person performs a deed,
they experience the result as it should be experienced.’ This being
so, the spiritual life can be lived, and there is a chance of making a
complete end of suffering.”

AN 3.101
##### A Panner

_Paṁsudhovakasutta_

1.1 “Native gold has coarse corruptions: sand, soil, and gravel. A panner or their apprentice pours it into a pan, where they wash, rinse,
and clean it. When that’s been eliminated, there are medium corruptions in the native gold: fine grit and coarse sand. The panner
washes it again. When that’s been eliminated, there are fine corruptions in the native gold: fine sand and black grime. The panner
washes it again. When that’s been eliminated, only golden flecks
remain. A goldsmith or their apprentice places the native gold in a
crucible where they blow, melt, and smelt it. Still the native gold is
not settled and the dross is not totally gone. It’s not pliable, workable, or radiant, but is brittle and not completely ready for working.
But the goldsmith keeps on blowing, melting, and smelting it. The
native gold becomes pliable, workable, and radiant, not brittle, and
ready to be worked. Then the goldsmith can successfully create
any kind of ornament they want, whether a bracelet, earrings, a
necklace, or a golden garland.
2.1 In the same way, a mendicant who is committed to the higher
mind has coarse corruptions: bad bodily, verbal, and mental conduct. A sincere, capable mendicant gives these up, gets rid of,
eliminates, and obliterates them.
2.2 When they’ve been given up and eliminated, there are middling corruptions: sensual, malicious, or cruel thoughts. A sincere,
capable mendicant gives these up, gets rid of, eliminates, and obliterates them.
When they ve been given up and eliminated, there are fine cor 2.3
ruptions: thoughtsoffamily,country,andstatus. Asincere,capable
mendicant gives these up, gets rid of, eliminates, and obliterates
them.
When they’ve been given up and eliminated, only thoughts 2.4
about the teaching are left. That immersion is not peaceful or
sublime or tranquil or unified, but is held in place by forceful suppression.
But there comes a time when that mind is stilled internally; it 2.6
settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi. That immersion is peaceful and sublime and tranquil and unified, not held in
place by forceful suppression. They extend the mind to realize by
insight each and every thing that can be realized by insight; and
they are capable of realizing those things, since each and every one
is within range.
If they wish: ‘May I wield the many kinds of psychic power: 3.1
multiplying myself and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unobstructed through a wall, a rampart, or a
mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it
were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged
through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with my hand
the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling my body
as far as the realm of divinity.’ They are capable of realizing these
things, since each and every one is within range.
If they wish: ‘With clairaudience that is purified and super- 4.1
human, may I hear both kinds of sounds, human and heavenly,
whether near or far.’ They are capable of realizing these things,
since each and every one is within range.
If they wish: ‘May I understand the minds of other beings and 5.1
individuals, having comprehended them with my mind. May I understand mind with greed as “mind with greed”, and mind without
greed as “mind without greed”; mind with hate as “mind with hate”,
and mind without hate as “mind without hate”; mind with delusion as “mind with delusion”, and mind without delusion as “mind
without delusion”; constricted mind as “constricted mind”, and
scattered mind as scattered mind ; expansive mind as expansive
mind”, and unexpansive mind as “unexpansive mind”; mind that
is not supreme as “mind that is not supreme”, and mind that is
supreme as “mind that is supreme”; mind immersed in samādhi as
“mind immersed in samādhi”, and mind not immersed in samādhi
as “mind not immersed in samādhi”; freed mind as “freed mind”,
and unfreed mind as “unfreed mind”.’ They are capable of realizing
these things, since each and every one is within range.
6.1 If they wish: ‘May I recollect many kinds of past lives. That is:
one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred,
a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world
contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the
world contracting and expanding. May I remember: “There, I was
named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my
food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how
my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn
somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I
looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure
and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away
from that place I was reborn here.” May I recollect my many past
lives, with features and details.’ They are capable of realizing these
things, since each and every one is within range.
7.1 If they wish: ‘With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, may I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—
inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad
place—and understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: “These dear beings did bad things by way of
body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they
had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view.
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of
loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however,
did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never
denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to
act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death,
they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.” And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, may I see sentient beings
passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful
and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. And may I understand
how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.’ They are
capable of realizing these things, since each and every one is within
range.
If they wish: ‘May I realize the undefiled freedom of heart and 8.1
freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with
my own insight due to the ending of defilements.’ They are capable
of realizing these things, since each and every one is within range.”

AN 3.102
##### Basis

_Nimittasutta_

“Mendicants, a mendicant committed to the higher mind should 1.1
focus on three bases from time to time: the basis of immersion,
the basis of exertion, and the basis of equanimity.
If a mendicant dedicated to the higher mind focuses solely on 1.3
the basis of immersion, it’s likely their mind will incline to laziness.
If they focus solely on the basis of exertion, it’s likely their mind 1.4
will incline to restlessness.
If they focus solely on the basis of equanimity, it’s likely their 1.5
mind won’t properly become immersed in samādhi for the ending
of defilements.
But when a mendicant dedicated to the higher mind focuses 1.6
from time to time on the basis of immersion, the basis of exertion,
and the basis of equanimity, their mind becomes pliable, workable, and radiant, not brittle, and has become rightly immersed in
samādhi for the ending of defilements.
It’s like when a goldsmith or a goldsmith’s apprentice prepares 2.1
a forge, fires the crucible, picks up some native gold with tongs
and puts it in the crucible. From time to time they fan it, from
time to time they sprinkle water on it, and from time to time they
just watch over it. If they solely fanned it, the native gold would
likely be scorched. If they solely sprinkled water on it, the native
gold would likely cool down. If they solely watched over it, the
native gold would likely not be properly processed. But when that
goldsmith fans it from time to time, sprinkles water on it from time
to time, and watches over it from time to time, that native gold
becomes pliable, workable, and radiant, not brittle, and is ready to
be worked. Then the goldsmith can successfully create any kind of
ornament they want, whether a bracelet, earrings, a necklace, or a
golden garland.
3.1 In the same way, a mendicant committed to the higher mind
should focus on three bases from time to time: the basis of immersion, the basis of exertion, and the basis of equanimity. …
3.6 When a mendicant dedicated to the higher mind focuses from
time to time on the basis of immersion, the basis of exertion, and
the basis of equanimity, their mind becomes pliable, workable, and
radiant, not brittle, and has become rightly immersed in samādhi
for the ending of defilements. They extend the mind to realize by
insight each and every thing that can be realized by insight; and
they are capable of realizing those things, since each and every one
is within range.
4.1 If they wish: ‘May I wield the many kinds of psychic power’ …
4.2 ‘With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, may I hear
both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far.’ …
‘May I recollect many kinds of past lives.’ … ‘With clairvoyance
that is purified and superhuman, may I see sentient beings passing
away and being reborn.’ … ‘May I realize the undefiled freedom
of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having
realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements.’
They are capable of realizing these things, since each and every one
is within range.”
