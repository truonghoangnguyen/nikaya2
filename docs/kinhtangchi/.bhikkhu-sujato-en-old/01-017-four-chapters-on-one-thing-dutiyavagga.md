1.1 “Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to unskillful
qualities, or, when they have arisen, makes them increase and grow
like wrong view. When you have wrong view, unskillful qualities
arise or, when they have arisen, they increase and grow.”

###### 310

1.1 “Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to wrong
view, and once arisen, makes it grow like irrational application of
mind. When you apply the mind irrationally, wrong view arises,
and once arisen it grows.”
###### 311

“Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to right view, 1.1
or, once it has already arisen, makes it grow like rational application
of mind. When you apply the mind rationally, right view arises,
and once arisen it grows.”

###### 312

“Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that causes sentient beings 1.1
to be reborn, when their body breaks up, after death, in a place
of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell like wrong view. It is
because they have wrong view that sentient beings, when their
body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad
place, the underworld, hell.”

###### 313

“Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that causes sentient beings 1.1
to be reborn, when their body breaks up, after death, in a good
place, a heavenly realm like right view. It is because they have right
view that sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death,
are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.”

###### 314

“Mendicants, when an individual has wrong view, whatever bodily, 1.1
verbal, or mental deeds they undertake in line with that view, their
intentions, aims, wishes, and choices all lead to what is unlikable,
undesirable, disagreeable, harmful, and suffering. Why is that?
Because their view is bad. Suppose a seed of neem, angled gourd,
or bitter gourd was planted in moist earth. Whatever nutrients it
takes up from the earth and water would lead to its bitter, acerbic,
and unpleasant taste. Why is that? Because the seed is bad. In the
same way, when an individual has wrong view, whatever bodily,
verbal, or mental deeds they undertake in line with that view, their
intentions, aims, wishes, and choices all lead to what is unlikable,
undesirable, disagreeable, harmful, and suffering. Why is that?
Because their view is bad.”

###### 315

1.1 “Mendicants, when an individual has right view, whatever bodily,
verbal, or mental deeds they undertake in line with that view, their
intentions, aims, wishes, and choices all lead to what is likable,
desirable, agreeable, beneficial, and pleasant. Why is that? Because
their view is good. Suppose a seed of sugar cane, fine rice, or grape
was planted in moist earth. Whatever nutrients it takes up from
the earth and water would lead to its sweet, pleasant, and delicious
taste. Whyisthat? Becausetheseedisgood. Inthesameway, when
an individual has right view, whatever bodily, verbal, or mental
deeds they undertake in line with that view, their intentions, aims,
wishes, and choices all lead to what is likable, desirable, agreeable,
beneficial, and pleasant. Why is that? Because their view is good.”
