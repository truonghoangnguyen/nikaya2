1.1 “Mendicants, I will teach you about living with bad people and
living with good people. Listen and apply your mind well, I will
speak.”
1.3 “Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:
2.1 “What is it like living with bad people? How do bad people live
together?
2.2 It’s when a senior mendicant thinks: ‘No mendicant, whether
senior, middle, or junior, should admonish me; and I shouldn’t
admonish any mendicant, whether senior, middle, or junior. If a
mendicant—whethersenior,middle,orjunior—weretoadmonish
me, they wouldn’t be sympathetic, and I’d bother them by saying
“No!” And anyway I wouldn’t deal with it even if I saw what I did
wrong.’
2.6 And a middle or a junior mendicant also thinks: ‘No mendicant,
whether senior, middle, or junior, should admonish me; and I
shouldn’t admonish any mendicant, whether senior, middle, or
junior. If a mendicant—whether senior, middle, or junior—were
to admonish me, they wouldn’t be sympathetic, and I’d bother
them by saying “No!” And anyway I wouldn’t deal with it even if I
saw what I did wrong.’
Thats what its like living with bad people; thats how bad people 2.12
live together.
What is it like living with good people? How do good people 3.1
live together? It’s when a senior mendicant thinks:
‘Any mendicant, whether senior, middle, or junior, should ad- 3.3
monishme; andIshouldadmonishanymendicant,whethersenior,
middle, or junior. If a mendicant—whether senior, middle, or junior—were to admonish me, they’d be sympathetic, so I wouldn’t
bother them, but say “Thank you!” And I’d deal with it when I saw
what I did wrong.’
And a middle or a junior mendicant also thinks: ‘Any mendi- 3.7
cant, whether senior, middle, or junior, may admonish me; and I’ll
admonish any mendicant, whether senior, middle, or junior. If a
mendicant—whether senior, middle, or junior—were to admonish me, they’d be sympathetic, so I wouldn’t bother them, but say
“Thank you!” And I’d deal with it when I saw what I did wrong.’
That’s what it’s like living with good people; that’s how good 3.12
people live together.”

###### 63

“In any disciplinary issue where on both sides the endless talk, con- 1.1
tempt for each other’s views, resentment, bitterness, and exasperation is not settled, you can expect that this disciplinary issue will
lead to lasting acrimony and enmity, and the mendicants will not
live comfortably.
In any disciplinary issue where on both sides the endless talk, 2.1
contempt for each other’s views, resentment, bitterness, and exasperation is well settled, you can expect that this disciplinary issue
won’t lead to lasting acrimony and enmity, and the mendicants will
live comfortably.”
