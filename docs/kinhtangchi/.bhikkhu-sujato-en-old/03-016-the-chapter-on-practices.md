_Acelakavagga_

“Mendicants, there are three practices. What three? The addicted 1.1
practice, the scorching practice, and the middle practice.
And what’s the addicted practice? It’s when someone has this 1.4
doctrine and view: ‘There’s nothing wrong with sensual pleasures’;
so they throw themselves into sensual pleasures. This is called the
addicted practice.
And what’s the scorching practice? It’s when someone goes 2.1
naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t
come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought
to them, or food prepared on their behalf, or an invitation for a
meal. They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from
someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in
their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman
who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who lives with a man; or where
there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat
or beer or wine, and drink no fermented gruel. They go to just one
house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two
mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls. They feed on
one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day. They
eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so
on, even up to once a fortnight. They live pursuing the practice of
eating food at set intervals.
3.1 They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice
bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung.
They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit.
4.1 They wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping
cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa
grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings.
They tear out their hair and beard, committed to this practice.
They constantly stand, refusing seats. They squat, committed to
persisting in the squatting position. They lie on a mat of thorns,
making a mat of thorns their bed. They’re devoted to ritual bathing
three times a day, including the evening. And so they live pursuing
these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body. This is
called the scorching practice.
5.1 And what’s the middle practice? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … They meditate observing
an aspect of the mind … They meditate observing an aspect of
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and
displeasure for the world. This is called the middle practice.
5.7 These are the three practices.

3.1 And what’s the middle practice? It’s when a mendicant generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives
so that bad, unskillful qualities don’t arise. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad,
unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up. They generate
enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that
skillful qualities arise. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an ef
fort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have
arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are completed
by development. …
