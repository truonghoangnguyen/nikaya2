##### Sectarian Tenets

_Titthāyatanasutta_

“Mendicants, these three sectarian tenets—as pursued, pressed, 1.1
and grilled by the astute—when taken to their conclusion, end
with inaction. What three?
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine 1.3
and view: ‘Everything this individual experiences—pleasurable,
painful, or neutral—is because of past deeds.’
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine 1.5
and view: ‘Everything this individual experiences—pleasurable,
painful, or neutral—is because of God Almighty’s creation.’
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine 1.7
and view: ‘Everything this individual experiences—pleasurable,
painful, or neutral—has no cause or reason.’
Regarding this, I went up to the ascetics and brahmins whose 2.1
view is that everything that is experienced is because of past deeds,
and I said to them: ‘Is it really true that this is the venerables’ view?’
Andtheyanswered,‘Yes’. Isaidtothem: ‘Inthatcase,youmightkill
living creatures, steal, be unchaste; use speech that’s false, divisive,
harsh, or nonsensical; be covetous, malicious, or have wrong view,
all because of past deeds.’
Those who believe that past deeds are the most important thing 3.1
have no enthusiasm or effort, no idea that there are things that
should and should not be done. Since they don t actually find
that there are things that should and should not be done, they’re
unmindful and careless, and can’t rightly be called ascetics. This
is my first legitimate refutation of the ascetics and brahmins who
have this doctrine and view.
4.1 Regarding this, I went up to the ascetics and brahmins whose
view is that everything that is experienced is because of God
Almighty’s creation, and I said to them: ‘Is it really true that this
is the venerables’ view?’ And they answered, ‘Yes’. I said to them:
‘In that case, you might kill living creatures, steal, be unchaste; use
speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; be covetous,
malicious, or have wrong view, all because of God Almighty’s creation.’
5.1 Those who believe that God Almighty’s creative power is the
most important thing have no enthusiasm, no effort, no idea that
there are things that should and should not be done. Since they
don’t actually find that there are things that should and should not
be done, they’re unmindful and careless, and can’t rightly be called
ascetics. This is my second legitimate refutation of the ascetics and
brahmins who have this doctrine and view.
6.1 Regarding this, I went up to the ascetics and brahmins whose
view is that everything that is experienced has no cause or reason,
and I said to them: ‘Is it really true that this is the venerables’ view?’
Andtheyanswered,‘Yes’. Isaidtothem: ‘Inthatcase,youmightkill
living creatures, steal, be unchaste; use speech that’s false, divisive,
harsh, or nonsensical; be covetous, malicious, or have wrong view,
all without cause or reason.’
7.1 Those who believe that the absence of cause or reason is the
most important thing have no enthusiasm, no effort, no idea that
there are things that should and should not be done. Since they
don’t actually find that there are things that should and should not
be done, they’re unmindful and careless, and can’t rightly be called
ascetics. This is my third legitimate refutation of the ascetics and
brahmins who have this doctrine and view.
These are the three sectarian tenets as pursued, pressed, and 8.1
grilled by the astute—which, when taken to their conclusion, end
with inaction.
But the Dhamma that I’ve taught is irrefutable, uncorrupted, be- 9.1
yond reproach, and not scorned by sensible ascetics and brahmins.
What is the Dhamma that I’ve taught?
‘These are the six elements’: this is the Dhamma I’ve taught … 9.3
‘These are the six fields of contact’: this is the Dhamma I’ve 9.4
taught …
‘These are the eighteen mental preoccupations’: this is the 9.5
Dhamma I’ve taught …
‘These are the four noble truths’: this is the Dhamma I’ve 9.6
taught that is irrefutable, uncorrupted, beyond reproach, and is
not scorned by sensible ascetics and brahmins.
‘“These are the six elements”: this is the Dhamma I’ve taught 10.1
…’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
There are these six elements: the elements of earth, water, fire, 10.4
air, space, and consciousness.
‘“These are the six elements”: this is the Dhamma I’ve taught 10.6
…’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
‘“These are the six fields of contact”: this is the Dhamma I’ve 11.1
taught …’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
There are these six fields of contact: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, 11.4
and mind contact.
‘“These are the six fields of contact”: this is the Dhamma I’ve 11.6
taught …’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
‘“These are the eighteen mental preoccupations”: this is the 12.1
Dhamma I’ve taught …’ This is what I said, but why did I say it?
Seeing a sight with the eye, one is preoccupied with a sight that’s 12.4
a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimity.
Hearing a sound with the ear … 12.5
Smelling an odor with the nose … 12.6
Tasting a flavor with the tongue … 12.7
Feeling a touch with the body … 12.8
12.9 Becoming conscious of an idea with the mind, one is preoc
cupied with an idea that’s a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimity.
12.10 ‘“These are the eighteen mental preoccupations”: this is the
Dhamma I’ve taught …’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
13.1 ‘“These are the four noble truths”: this is the Dhamma I’ve
taught …’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
13.4 Supported by the six elements, an embryo is conceived. When
it is conceived, there are name and form. Name and form are
conditionsforthesixsensefields. Thesixsensefieldsareconditions
for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. It’s for one who feels
that I declare: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’
… ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that
leads to the cessation of suffering’.
14.1 And what is the noble truth of suffering? Rebirth is suffering;
old age is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain,
sadness, and distress are suffering; association with the disliked is
suffering; separation from the liked is suffering; not getting what
you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are
suffering. This is called the noble truth of suffering.
15.1 And what is the noble truth of the origin of suffering? Ignorance
is a condition for choices. Choices are a condition for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and
form are conditions for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are
conditions for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is
a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence
is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and
death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come
to be. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. This is
called the noble truth of the origin of suffering.
16.1 And what is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering? When
ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices
cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and form
cease, the six sense fields cease. When the six sense fields cease,
contact ceases. When contact ceases, feeling ceases. When feeling ceases, craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases.
When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age
and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease.
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases. This is called the
noble truth of the cessation of suffering.
And what is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the 17.1
cessation of suffering? It is simply this noble eightfold path, that
is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. This is
called the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of
suffering.
‘“These are the four noble truths”: this is the Dhamma I’ve 17.5
taught that is irrefutable, uncorrupted, beyond reproach, and is
not scorned by sensible ascetics and brahmins.’ That’s what I said,
and this is why I said it.”

##### Perils

_Bhayasutta_

“Mendicants, an unlearned ordinary person speaks of three perils 1.1
that tear mothers and children apart. What three?
There comes a time when a great fire flares up, and it burns 1.3
villages, towns, and cities. When this happens, a mother can’t find
her child, and a child can’t find their mother. This is the first peril
that tears mothers and children apart.
Furthermore, there comes a time when a great storm gathers, 2.1
and it unleashes a mighty flood that sweeps away villages, towns,
and cities. When this happens, a mother can’t find her child, and
a child can’t find their mother. This is the second peril that tears
mothers and children apart.
3.1 Furthermore, there comes a time of peril due to turmoil in the
wilds, so the countryfolk mount their vehicles and flee everywhere.
When this happens, a mother can’t find her child, and a child can’t
find their mother. This is the third peril that tears mothers and
children apart.
3.4 These are the three perils an unlearned ordinary person speaks
of that tear mothers and children apart.
4.1 Mendicants, an unlearned ordinary person speaks of three perils
that don’t tear mothers and children apart. What three?
4.3 There comes a time when a great fire flares up, and it burns
villages,towns,andcities. Whenthishappens,sometimesamother
can find her child, and a child can find their mother. This is the
first peril that doesn’t tear mothers and children apart.
5.1 Furthermore, there comes a time when a great storm gathers,
and it unleashes a mighty flood that sweeps away villages, towns,
and cities. When this happens, sometimes a mother can find her
child, and a child can find their mother. This is the second peril
that doesn’t tear mothers and children apart.
6.1 Furthermore, there comes a time of peril due to turmoil in the
wilds, so the countryfolk mount their vehicles and flee everywhere.
When this happens, sometimes a mother can find her child, and a
child can find their mother. This is the third peril that doesn’t tear
mothers and children apart.
6.4 These are the three perils an unlearned ordinary person speaks
of that don’t tear mothers and children apart.
7.1 There arethreeperilsthattearmothersandchildrenapart. What
three?
7.3 The perils of old age, sickness, and death. When a child is growing old, a mother doesn’t get her wish: ‘Let me grow old, may my
child not grow old!’ When a mother is growing old, a child doesn’t
get their wish: ‘Let me grow old, may my mother not grow old!’
8.1 When a child is sick, a mother doesn’t get her wish: ‘Let me be
sick, may my child not be sick!’ When a mother is sick, a child
doesn’t get their wish: ‘Let me be sick, may my mother not be sick!’
When a child is dying, a mother doesn t get her wish: Let me 9.1
die, may my child not die!’ When a mother is dying, a child doesn’t
get their wish: ‘Let me die, may my mother not die!’ These are the
three perils that tear mothers and children apart.
There is a path and a practice that leads to giving up and going 10.1
beyond the three perils that don’t tear mothers and children apart,
and the three perils that do tear mothers and children apart. What
is that path and practice? It is simply this noble eightfold path,
that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right
livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
This is the path, this is the practice that leads to giving up and going
beyond the three perils that don’t tear mothers and children apart,
and the three perils that do tear mothers and children apart.”

AN 3.63
##### At Venāgapura

_Venāgapurasutta_

At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans 1.1
together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a
village of the Kosalan brahmins named Venāgapura. The brahmins
and householders of Venāgapura heard:
“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a 1.3
Sakyan family—has arrived at Venāgapura. He has this good reputation: ‘ThatBlessedOneisperfected,afullyawakenedBuddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world,
supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and
humans, awakened, blessed.’ He has realized with his own insight
this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population
with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes
it known to others. He proclaims a teaching that is good in the
beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful
and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely
full and pure. It’s good to see such perfected ones.”
2.1 Then the brahmins and householders of Venāgapura went up to
the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some
exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their
joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and
clan, while some kept silent. Then the brahmin Vacchagotta of
Venāgapura said to the Buddha:
3.1 “It’s incredible, Mister Gotama, it’s amazing, how your faculties
are so very clear, and the complexion of your skin is pure and
bright. It’s like a golden brown jujube in the autumn, or a palm
fruit freshly plucked from the stalk, or a pendant of Black Plum
River gold, fashioned by a deft smith, well-wrought in the forge,
and placed on a cream rug where it shines and glows and radiates.
Inthesameway,yourfacultiesaresoveryclear,andthecomplexion
of your skin is pure and bright.
3.9 Surely Mister Gotama gets when he wants, without trouble or
difficulty, various kinds of high and luxurious bedding, such as:
sofas, couches, woolen covers—shag-piled, colorful, white, embroidered with flowers, quilted, embroidered with animals, doubleor single-fringed—and silk covers studded with gems, as well as
silken sheets, woven carpets, rugs for elephants, horses, or chariots,
antelope hide rugs, and spreads of fine deer hide, with a canopy
above and red cushions at both ends.”
4.1 “Brahmin, these various kinds of high and luxurious bedding are
hard for renunciates to find. And even if they do get them, they’re
not allowed.
5.1 There are, brahmin, these three high and luxurious beds that I
get these days when I want, without trouble or difficulty. What
three? The heavenly high and luxurious bed, the divine high and
luxurious bed, and the noble high and luxurious bed. These are the
three high and luxurious beds that I get these days when I want,
without trouble or difficulty.”
6.1 “But what, Mister Gotama, is the heavenly high and luxurious
bed?”
6.2 “Brahmin, when I am living supported by a village or town, I
robe up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, enter the
town or village for alms. After the meal, on my return from alm
sround, I enter within a forest. I gather up some grass or leaves
into a pile and sit down cross-legged, setting my body straight,
and establishing mindfulness in my presence. Quite secluded from
sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of
seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the
placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, I enter and
remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss
born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without
placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the fading
away of rapture, I enter and remain in the third absorption, where
I meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and
mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ With the giving up of pleasure and
pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, I enter and
remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with
pure equanimity and mindfulness. When I’m practicing like this,
if I walk, at that time my walking is heavenly. When I’m practicing
like this, if I stand, at that time my standing is heavenly. When
I’m practicing like this, if I sit, at that time my sitting is heavenly.
When I’m practicing like this, if I lie down, at that time my lying
is heavenly. This is the heavenly high and luxurious bed that I get
these days when I want, without trouble or difficulty.”
“It’s incredible, Mister Gotama, it’s amazing! Who but Mister 7.1
Gotama could get such a heavenly high and luxurious bed when
he wants, without trouble or difficulty?
But what, Mister Gotama, is the divine high and luxurious bed?” 8.1
“Brahmin, when I am living supported by a village or town, I 8.2
robe up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, enter the
town or village for alms. After the meal, on my return from almsround, I enter within a forest. I gather up some grass or leaves
into a pile and sit down cross-legged, setting my body straight, and
establishing mindfulness in my presence. I meditate spreading a
heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the
third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across,
everywhere, all around, I spread a heart full of love to the whole
world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
I meditate spreading a heart full of compassion to one direction,
and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same
way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, I spread a heart
full of compassion to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. I meditate spreading a heart full of
rejoicing to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and
to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere,
all around, I spread a heart full of rejoicing to the whole world—
abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. I meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to
the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way
above, below, across, everywhere, all around, I spread a heart full
of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless,
free of enmity and ill will. When I’m practicing like this, if I walk,
at that time my walking is divine. … my standing is divine. … my
sitting is divine. When I’m practicing like this, if I lie down, at that
time my lying is divine. This is the divine high and luxurious bed
that I get these days when I want, without trouble or difficulty.”
9.1 “It’s incredible, Mister Gotama, it’s amazing! Who but Mister
Gotama could get such a divine high and luxurious bed when he
wants, without trouble or difficulty?
10.1 “But what, Mister Gotama, is the noble high and luxurious bed?”
10.2 “Brahmin, when I am living supported by a village or town,
I robe up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, enter
the town or village for alms. After the meal, on my return from
almsround, I enter within a forest. I gather up some grass or leaves
into a pile and sit down cross-legged, setting my body straight, and
establishing mindfulness in his presence. I know this: ‘I’ve given
up greed, hate, and delusion, cut them off at the root, made them
like a palm stump, obliterated them, so they’re unable to arise in
the future.’ When I’m practicing like this, if I walk, at that time my
walking is noble. … my standing is noble. … my sitting is noble.
When I m practicing like this, if I lie down, at that time my lying
is noble. This is the noble high and luxurious bed that I get these
days when I want, without trouble or difficulty.”
“It’s incredible, Mister Gotama, it’s amazing! Who but Mister 11.1
Gotama could get such a noble high and luxurious bed when he
wants, without trouble or difficulty?
Excellent, Mister Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the 12.1
overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the
lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see
what’s there, Mister Gotama has made the teaching clear in many
ways. We go for refuge to Mister Gotama, to the teaching, and to
the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Mister Gotama
remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.”

AN 3.64
##### With Sarabha

_Sarabhasutta_

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near 1.1
Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.
Now at that time a wanderer called Sarabha had recently left 1.3
this teaching and training. He was telling a crowd in Rājagaha, “I
learned the teaching of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan, then I
left their teaching and training.”
Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking 1.7
their bowls and robes, entered Rājagaha for alms. They heard what
Sarabha was saying.
Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they 2.1
went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to
him, “The wanderer called Sarabha has recently left this teaching
and training. He was telling a crowd in Rājagaha: ‘I learned the
teaching of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan, then I left their
teaching and training.’ Sir, please go to the wanderers’ monastery
on the banks of the Sappinī river to see Sarabha the wanderer out
of sympathy.” The Buddha consented with silence.
3.1 Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and
went to the wanderers’ monastery on the banks of the Sappinī river
to visit Sarabha the wanderer. He sat on the seat spread out, and
said to the wanderer Sarabha, “Is it really true, Sarabha, that you’ve
been saying: ‘I learned the teaching of the ascetics who follow the
Sakyan, then I left their teaching and training.’” When he said this,
Sarabha kept silent.
4.1 For a second time, the Buddha said to Sarabha, “Tell me,
Sarabha, what exactly have you learned of the teachings of the
ascetics who follow the Sakyan? If you’ve not learned it fully, I’ll
fill you in. But if you have learned it fully, I’ll agree.” For a second
time, Sarabha kept silent.
5.1 For a third time, the Buddha said to Sarabha, “Sarabha, the
teachings of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan are clear to me.
What exactly have you learned of the teachings of the ascetics who
follow the Sakyan? If you’ve not learned it fully, I’ll fill you in. But
if you have learned it fully, I’ll agree.” For a third time, Sarabha kept
silent.
6.1 Then those wanderers said to Sarabha, “The ascetic Gotama has
offered to tell you anything you ask for. Speak, reverend Sarabha,
what exactly have you learned of the teachings of the ascetics who
follow the Sakyan? If you’ve not learned it fully, he’ll fill you in. But
if you have learned it fully, he’ll agree.” When this was said, Sarabha
sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed,
with nothing to say.
7.1 Knowing this, the Buddha said to the wanderers:
8.1 “Wanderers, someone might say to me: ‘You claim to be a fully
awakenedBuddha, butyoudon’tunderstandthesethings.’ ThenI’d
carefully pursue, press, and grill them on that point. When grilled
by me, they would, without a doubt, fall into one of these three
categories. They’d dodge the issue, distracting the discussion with
irrelevant points. They’d display annoyance, hate, and bitterness.
Or they d sit silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, de
pressed, with nothing to say, like Sarabha.
Wanderers, someone might say to me: ‘You claim to have ended 9.1
all defilements, but you still have these defilements.’ Then I’d carefully pursue, press, and grill them on that point. When grilled by
me, they would, without a doubt, fall into one of these three categories. They’d dodge the issue, distracting the discussion with
irrelevant points. They’d display annoyance, hate, and bitterness.
Or they’d sit silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say, like Sarabha.
Wanderers, someone might say to me: ‘Your teaching does not 10.1
lead someone who practices it to the complete ending of suffering,
the goal for which it is taught.’ Then I’d carefully pursue, press,
and grill them on that point. When grilled by me, they would,
without a doubt, fall into one of these three categories. They’d
dodge the issue, distracting the discussion with irrelevant points.
They’d display annoyance, hate, and bitterness. Or they’d sit silent,
dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing
to say, like Sarabha.”
Then the Buddha, having roared his lion’s roar three times in the 10.4
wanderers’ monastery on the bank of the Sappinī river, rose into
the air and flew away.
Soon after the Buddha left, those wanderers beset Sarabha on 11.1
all sides with sneering and jeering. “Reverend Sarabha, you’re just
like an old jackal in the formidable wilderness who thinks, ‘I’ll roar
a lion’s roar!’ but they still only manage to squeal and yelp like a
jackal. In the same way, when the ascetic Gotama wasn’t here you
said ‘I’ll roar a lion’s roar!’ but you only managed to squeal and
yelp like a jackal.
You’re just like a marsh hen who thinks, ‘I’ll cry like a cuckoo!’ 11.4
but they still only manage to cry like a marsh hen. In the same
way, when the ascetic Gotama wasn’t here you said ‘I’ll cry like a
cuckoo!’ but you still only managed to cry like a marsh hen.
You’re justlikeabullthatthinkstobellowonlywhenthecowstall 11.6
is empty. In the same way, you only thought to bellow when the
ascetic Gotama wasn t here. Thats how those wanderers beset
Sarabha on all sides with sneering and jeering.

AN 3.65
##### With the Kālāmas of Kesamutta

_Kesamuttisutta_

1.1 So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was wandering in the
land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants
when he arrived at a town of the Kālāmas named Kesamutta. The
Kālāmas of Kesamutta heard:
1.4 “It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a
Sakyan family—has arrived at Kesamutta. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha
…’ It’s good to see such perfected ones.”
2.1 Then the Kālāmas went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down
to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite
conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha,
some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.
Seated to one side the Kālāmas said to the Buddha:
3.1 “There are, sir, some ascetics and brahmins who come to Kesamutta. They explain and promote only their own doctrine, while
they attack, badmouth, disparage, and smear the doctrines of others. Then some other ascetics and brahmins come to Kesamutta.
They too explain and promote only their own doctrine, while they
attack, badmouth, disparage, and smear the doctrines of others.
So, sir, we’re doubting and uncertain: ‘I wonder who of these respected ascetics and brahmins speaks the truth, and who speaks
falsehood?’”
3.7 “It is enough, Kālāmas, for you to be doubting and uncertain.
Doubt has come up in you about an uncertain matter.
4.1 Please, Kālāmas, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t
rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned train of
thought, don t go by the acceptance of a view after deliberation,
don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’ But when you know for yourselves:
‘These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible
people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and
suffering’, then you should give them up.
What do you think, Kālāmas? Does greed come up in a person 5.1
for their welfare or harm?”
“Harm, sir.” 6.1
“A greedy individual, overcome by greed, kills living creatures, 7.1
steals,commitsadultery,lies,andencouragesotherstodothesame.
Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”
“Yes, sir.” 8.1
“What do you think, Kālāmas? Does hate come up in a person 9.1
for their welfare or harm?”
“Harm, sir.” 10.1
“A hateful individual, overcome by hate, kills living creatures, 11.1
steals,commitsadultery,lies,andencouragesotherstodothesame.
Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”
“Yes, sir.” 12.1
“What do you think, Kālāmas? Does delusion come up in a 13.1
person for their welfare or harm?”
“Harm, sir.” 14.1
“A deluded individual, overcome by delusion, kills living crea- 15.1
tures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do
the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”
“Yes, sir.” 16.1
“What do you think, Kālāmas, are these things skillful or un- 17.1
skillful?”
“Unskillful, sir.” 18.1
“Blameworthy or blameless?” 19.1
“Blameworthy, sir.” 20.1
“Criticized or praised by sensible people?” 21.1
“Criticized by sensible people, sir.” 22.1
23.1 When you undertake them, do they lead to harm and suffering,
or not? Or how do you see this?”
24.1 “When you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering.
That’s how we see it.”
25.1 “So, Kālāmas, whenIsaid: ‘Please, don’tgobyoraltransmission,
don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical
authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by
reasoned train of thought, don’t go by the acceptance of a view
after deliberation, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and
don’t think “The ascetic is our respected teacher.” But when you
know for yourselves: “These things are unskillful, blameworthy,
criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they
lead to harm and suffering”, then you should give them up.’ That’s
what I said, and this is why I said it.
26.1 Please, Kālāmas, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t
rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned train of
thought, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after deliberation,

‘These things are skillful, blameless, praised by sensible people, and
when you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness’,
then you should acquire them and keep them.
27.1 What do you think, Kālāmas? Does contentment come up in a
person for their welfare or harm?”
28.1 “Welfare, sir.”
29.1 “An individual who is content, not overcome by greed, doesn’t
kill living creatures, steal, commit adultery, lie, or encourage others
to do the same. Is that for their lasting welfare and happiness?”
30.1 “Yes, sir.”
31.1 “What do you think, Kālāmas? Does love come up in a person
for their welfare or harm? … Does understanding come up in a
person for their welfare or harm? … Is that for their lasting welfare
and happiness?”
32.1 “Yes, sir.”
What do you think, Kālāmas, are these things skillful or un 33.1
skillful?”
“Skillful, sir.” 34.1
“Blameworthy or blameless?” 35.1
“Blameless, sir.” 36.1
“Criticized or praised by sensible people?” 37.1
“Praised by sensible people, sir.” 38.1
“When you undertake them, do they lead to welfare and happi- 39.1
ness, or not? Or how do you see this?”
“When you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness. 40.1
That’s how we see it.”
“So, Kālāmas, whenIsaid: ‘Please, don’tgobyoraltransmission, 41.1

don’t think “The ascetic is our respected teacher.” But when you
know for yourselves:
“These things are skillful, blameless, praised by sensible people, 41.5

then you should acquire them and keep them.’ That’s what I said,
and this is why I said it.
Then that noble disciple is rid of desire, rid of ill will, uncon- 42.1
fused, aware, and mindful. They meditate spreading a heart full
of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and
to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere,
all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—
abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion to one di- 42.2

in this very life. ‘If it turns out there is another world, and good
and bad deeds have a result, then—when the body breaks up, after
death—I’ll be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ This is the
first consolation they’ve won.

things, then since I have no bad intentions, and since I’m not doing anything bad, how can suffering touch me?’ This is the third
consolation they’ve won.
46.1 ‘If it turns out that bad things don’t happen to people who do
bad things, then I still see myself pure on both sides.’ This is the
fourth consolation they’ve won.
47.1 When that noble disciple has a mind that’s free of enmity and ill
will, undefiled and purified, they’ve won these four consolations
in this very life.”
48.1 “That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! When
that noble disciple has a mind that’s free of enmity and ill will,
undefiled and purified, they’ve won these four consolations in this
very life. …
53.1 Excellent, sir! Excellent! … We go for refuge to the Buddha, to
the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth,
may the Buddha remember us as lay followers who have gone for
refuge for life.”

##### With Sāḷha and His Friend

_Sāḷhasutta_

So I have heard. Now at that time Venerable Nandaka was 1.1
stayingnearSāvatthīinthestiltlonghouseofMigāra’smotherinthe
Eastern Monastery. Then Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson, and Rohaṇa,
Pekhuṇiya’s grandson went up to Venerable Nandaka, bowed, and
sat down to one side. Then Venerable Nandaka said to Sāḷha:
“Please, Sāḷha and friend, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go 2.1
by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority,
don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned
train of thought, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after deliberation, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t
think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’ But when you know for
yourselves: ‘These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by
sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm
and suffering’, then you should give them up.
What do you think, Sāḷha? Is greed real?” 3.1
“Yes, sir.” 4.1
“‘Covetousness’ is what I mean by this. A person who is greedy 5.1
and covetous kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies,
and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm
and suffering?”
“Yes, sir.” 6.1
“What do you think, Sāḷha? Is hate real?” 7.1
“Yes, sir.” 8.1
“‘Malice’ is what I mean by this. A hateful and malicious person 9.1
kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages
others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”
“Yes, sir.” 10.1
11.1 What do you think, Sāḷha? Is delusion real?
12.1 “Yes, sir.”
13.1 “‘Ignorance’ is what I mean by this. A person who is deluded
and ignorant kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies,
and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm
and suffering?”
14.1 “Yes, sir.”
15.1 “What do you think, Sāḷha, are these things skillful or unskillful?”
16.1 “Unskillful, sir.”
17.1 “Blameworthy or blameless?”
18.1 “Blameworthy, sir.”
19.1 “Criticized or praised by sensible people?”
20.1 “Criticized by sensible people, sir.”
21.1 “When you undertake them, do they lead to harm and suffering,
or not? Or how do you see this?”
22.1 “When you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering.
That’s how we see it.”
23.1 “So, Sāḷha and friend, when I said: ‘Please, don’t go by oral
transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go

know for yourselves: “These things are unskillful, blameworthy,
criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they
lead to harm and suffering”, then you should give them up.’ That’s
what I said, and this is why I said it.
24.1 Please, Sāḷha and friend, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go
by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority,
don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned
train of thought, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after deliberation, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think
‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’ But when you know for yourselves: ‘These things are skillful, blameless, praised by sensible
people, and when you undertake them, they lead to welfare and
happiness’, then you should acquire them and keep them.
What do you think? Is contentment real?” 25.1
“Yes, sir.” 26.1
“‘Satisfaction’ is what I mean by this. A person who is content 27.1
and satisfied doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit adultery, lie,
or encourage others to do the same. Is that for their lasting welfare
and happiness?”
“Yes, sir.” 28.1
What do you think? Is love real?” 29.1
“Yes, sir.” 30.1
“‘Kindness’ is what I mean by this. A loving and kind-hearted 31.1
person doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit adultery, lie, or
encourage others to do the same. Is that for their lasting welfare
and happiness?”
“Yes, sir.” 32.1
“What do you think, Sāḷha? Is understanding real?” 33.1
“Yes, sir.” 34.1
“‘Knowledge’ is what I mean by this. A person who understands 35.1
and knows doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit adultery, lie,
or encourage others to do the same. Is that for their lasting welfare
and happiness?”
“Yes, sir.” 36.1
“What do you think, Sāḷha, are these things skillful or unskill- 37.1
ful?”
“Skillful, sir.” 38.1
“Blameworthy or blameless?” 39.1
“Blameless, sir.” 40.1
“Criticized or praised by sensible people?” 41.1
“Praised by sensible people, sir.” 42.1
“When you undertake them, do they lead to welfare and happi- 43.1
ness, or not? Or how do you see this?”
“When you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness. 44.1
That’s how we see it.”
45.1 So, Sāḷha and friend, when I said: Please, don t go by oral
transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go
by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference,
don’t go by reasoned train of thought, don’t go by the acceptance of
aviewafterdeliberation,don’tgobytheappearanceofcompetence,
and don’t think “The ascetic is our respected teacher.” But when
you know for yourselves:
45.4 “These things are skillful, blameless, praised by sensible people,
and when you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness”,
then you should acquire them and keep them.’ That’s what I said,
and this is why I said it.
46.1 Then thatnoblediscipleisridofdesire,ridofillwill,unconfused,
aware, and mindful. They meditate spreading a heart full of love
… compassion … rejoicing … equanimity to one direction, and
to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same
way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a
heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive,
limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
46.5 They understand: ‘There is this, there is what is worse than this,
there is what is better than this, and there is an escape beyond the
scope of perception.’ Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is
freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and
ignorance. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.
46.9 They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has
been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’
47.1 They understand: ‘Formerly there was greed, which was unskillful. Now there is none, so that’s skillful. Formerly there was
hate, which was unskillful. Now there is none, so that’s skillful.
Formerly there was delusion, which was unskillful. Now there is
none, so that’s skillful.’ So they live without wishes in this very life,
quenched, cooled, experiencing bliss, with self become divine.”

##### Topics of Discussion

_Kathāvatthusutta_

“There are, mendicants, these three topics of discussion. What 1.1
three? You might discuss the past: ‘That is how it was in the past.’
You might discuss the future: ‘That is how it will be in the future.’
Or you might discuss the present: ‘This is how it is at present.’
You can know whether or not a person is competent to hold a 2.1
discussion by seeing how they take part in a discussion. When a
person is asked a question, if it needs to be answered categorically
and they don’t answer it categorically; or if it needs analysis and
they answer without analyzing it; or if it needs a counter-question
and they answer without a counter-question; or if it should be set
aside and they don’t set it aside, then that person is not competent
to hold a discussion. When a person is asked a question, if it needs
to be answered categorically and they answer it categorically; or if
it needs analysis and they answer after analyzing it; or if it needs
a counter-question and they answer with a counter-question; or
if it should be set aside and they set it aside, then that person is
competent to hold a discussion.
You can know whether or not a person is competent to hold a 3.1
discussion by seeing how they take part in a discussion. When a
person is asked a question, if they’re not consistent about what
their position is and what it isn’t; about what they propose; about
speaking from what they know; and about the appropriate procedure, then that person is not competent to hold a discussion.
When a person is asked a question, if they are consistent about
what their position is and what it isn’t; about what they propose;
about speaking from what they know; and about the appropriate
procedure, then that person is competent to hold a discussion.
You can know whether or not a person is competent to hold 4.1
a discussion by seeing how they take part in a discussion. When
a person is asked a question, if they dodge the issue; distract the
discussion with irrelevant points; or display annoyance, hate, and
bitterness, then that person is not competent to hold a discussion.
When a person is asked a question, if they don’t dodge the issue;
distract the discussion with irrelevant points; or display annoyance, hate, and bitterness, then that person is competent to hold a
discussion.
5.1 You can know whether or not a person is competent to hold
a discussion by seeing how they take part in a discussion. When
a person is asked a question, if they intimidate, crush, mock, or
seize on trivial mistakes, then that person is not competent to hold
a discussion. When a person is asked a question, if they don’t
intimidate, crush, mock, or seize on trivial mistakes, then that
person is competent to hold a discussion.
6.1 You can know whether or not a person has what’s required by
seeing how they take part in a discussion. If they actively listen
they have what’s required; if they don’t actively listen they don’t
have what’s required. Someone who has what’s required directly
knows one thing, completely understands one thing, gives up one
thing, and realizes one thing—and then they experience complete
freedom. This is the purpose of discussion, consultation, the requirements, and listening well, that is, the liberation of the mind
by not grasping.

7.1 Those who converse with hostility,
too sure of themselves, arrogant,
ignoble, attacking virtues,
they look for flaws in each other.

8.1 They rejoice together when their opponent
speaks poorly and makes a mistake,
becoming confused and defeated—
but the noble ones don’t discuss like this.

9.1 If an astute person wants to hold a discussion
connected with the teaching and its meaning—
the kind of discussion that noble ones hold—
then that wise one should start the discussion,

knowing when the time is right, 10.1
neither hostile nor arrogant.
Not over-excited,
contemptuous, or aggressive,

or with a mind full of jealousy, 11.1
they’d speak from what they rightly know.
They agree with what was well spoken,
without criticizing what was poorly said.

They’d not persist in finding faults, 12.1
nor seize on trivial mistakes,
neither intimidating nor crushing the other,
nor would they speak suggestively.

Good people consult 13.1
for the sake of knowledge and clarity.
That’s how the noble ones consult,
this is a noble consultation.
Knowing this, an intelligent person
would consult without arrogance.”

##### Followers of Other Religions

_Aññatitthiyasutta_

“Mendicants, if wanderers of other religions were to ask: ‘There are 1.1
these three things. What three? Greed, hate, and delusion. These
are the three things. What’s the difference between them?’ How
would you answer them?”
“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and 1.8
our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning
of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”
1.9 Well then, mendicants, listen and apply your mind well, I will
speak.”
1.10 “Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:
2.1 “Mendicants, if wanderers of other religions were to ask: ‘There
are these three things. What three? Greed, hate, and delusion.
These are the three things. What’s the difference between them?’
You should answer them: ‘Greed, reverends, is mildly blameworthy, but slow to fade away. Hate is very blameworthy, but quick to
fade away. Delusion is very blameworthy, and slow to fade away.’
3.1 And if they ask: ‘What is the cause, what is the reason why
greed arises, and once arisen it increases and grows?’ You should
say: ‘The beautiful feature of things. When you apply the mind
irrationally to the beautiful feature of things, greed arises, and once
arisen it increases and grows. This is the cause, this is the reason
why greed arises, and once arisen it increases and grows.’
4.1 And if they ask: ‘What is the cause, what is the reason why hate
arises, and once arisen it increases and grows?’ You should say:
‘The feature of harshness. When you apply the mind irrationally to
the feature of harshness, hate arises, and once arisen it increases
and grows. This is the cause, this is the reason why hate arises, and
once arisen it increases and grows.’
5.1 And if they ask: ‘What is the cause, what is the reason why
delusionarises, andoncearisenitincreasesandgrows?’ Youshould
say: ‘Irrational application of mind. When you apply the mind
irrationally, delusion arises, and once arisen it increases and grows.
This is the cause, this is the reason why delusion arises, and once
arisen it increases and grows.’
6.1 And if they ask, ‘What is the cause, what is the reason why greed
doesn’t arise, or if it’s already arisen it’s given up?’ You should say:
‘The ugly feature of things. When you apply the mind rationally
on the ugly feature of things, greed doesn’t arise, or if it’s already
arisen it’s given up. This is the cause, this is the reason why greed
doesn’t arise, or if it’s already arisen it’s given up.’
7.1 And if they ask, ‘What is the cause, what is the reason why hate
doesn’t arise, or if it’s already arisen it’s given up?’ You should say:
The hearts release by love. When you apply the mind rationally
on the heart’s release by love, hate doesn’t arise, or if it’s already
arisen it’s given up. This is the cause, this is the reason why hate
doesn’t arise, or if it’s already arisen it’s given up.’
And if they ask, ‘What is the cause, what is the reason why 8.1
delusion doesn’t arise, or if it’s already arisen it’s given up?’ You
should say: ‘Rational application of mind. When you apply the
mind rationally, delusion doesn’t arise, or if it’s already arisen it’s
given up. This is the cause, this is the reason why delusion doesn’t
arise, or if it’s already arisen it’s given up.’”

AN 3.69
##### Unskillful Roots

_Akusalamūlasutta_

“Mendicants, there are these three unskillful roots. What three? 1.1
Greed, hate, and delusion.
Greed is a root of the unskillful. When a greedy person chooses 2.1
to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is unskillful. When
a greedy person, overcome by greed, causes another to suffer under a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation
or condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want
power’, that too is unskillful. And so these many bad, unskillful
things are produced in them, born, sourced, originated, and conditioned by greed.
Hate is a root of the unskillful. When a hateful person chooses 3.1
to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is unskillful. When
a hateful person, overcome by hate, causes another to suffer under a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation
or condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want
power’, that too is unskillful. And so these many bad, unskillful
things are produced in them, born, sourced, originated, and conditioned by hate.
4.1 Delusion is a root of the unskillful. When a deluded person
chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is unskillful. When a deluded person, overcome by delusion, causes another
to suffer under a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or
confiscation or condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want power’, that too is unskillful. And so these many bad,
unskillful things are produced in them, born, sourced, originated,
and conditioned by delusion. Such a person is said to have speech
that’s ill-timed, false, meaningless, not in line with the teaching and
training.
5.1 Why is this? This person causes another to suffer under a false
pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want power’.
So when someone makes a valid criticism, they’re scornful and admit nothing. When someone makes a baseless criticism, they make
noefforttoexplain, ‘Thisiswhythat’suntrue, thisiswhythat’sfalse.’
That’swhysuchapersonissaidtohavespeechthat’sill-timed, false,
meaningless, not in line with the teaching and training.
6.1 Such a person—overcome with bad, unskillful qualities born of
greed, hate, and delusion—suffers in this very life, with distress,
anguish, and fever. And when the body breaks up, after death, they
can expect to be reborn in a bad place.
7.1 Suppose a sal, axlewood, or boxwood tree was choked and engulfed by three camel’s foot creepers. It would fall to ruin and
disaster. In the same way, such a person—overcome with bad,
unskillful qualities born of greed, hate, and delusion—suffers in
this very life, with distress, anguish, and fever. And when the body
breaks up, after death, they can expect to be reborn in a bad place.
8.1 These are the three unskillful roots.
9.1 There are these three skillful roots. What three? Contentment,
love, and understanding.
10.1 Contentment is a root of the skillful. When a contented person
chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is skillful.
When a contented person, not overcome by greed, doesn’t cause
another to suffer under a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment thinking
‘I’m powerful, I want power’, that too is skillful. And so these many
skillful things are produced in them, born, sourced, originated, and
conditioned by contentment.
Love isarootoftheskillful. Whenalovingpersonchoosestoact 11.1
by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is skillful. When a loving
person,notovercomebyhate,doesn’tcauseanothertosufferunder
a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or
condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want
power’, that too is skillful. And so these many skillful things are
produced in them, born, sourced, originated, and conditioned by
love.
Understanding is a root of the skillful. When an understanding 12.1
person chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is
skillful. When an understanding person, not overcome by delusion, doesn’t cause another to suffer under a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want power’, that too is skillful.
And so these many skillful things are produced in them, born,
sourced, originated, and conditioned by understanding. Such a
person is said to have speech that’s well-timed, true, meaningful,
in line with the teaching and training.
Why is this? This person doesn’t cause another to suffer under 13.1
a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation
or condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want
power’. So when someone makes a valid criticism, they admit it
and aren’t scornful. When someone makes a baseless criticism,
they make an effort to explain, ‘This is why that’s untrue, this is
why that’s false.’ That’s why such a person is said to have speech
that’s well-timed, true, meaningful, in line with the teaching and
training.
For such a person, bad unskillful qualities born of greed, hate, 14.1
and delusion are cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. In this very life they’re
happy, free of distress, anguish, and fever, and they re also extin
guished in this very life.
15.1 Suppose a sal, axlewood, or boxwood tree was choked and engulfed by three camel’s foot creepers. Then along comes a person
with a spade and basket. They’d cut the creeper out by the roots,
dig them up, and pull them out, down to the fibers and stems.
Then they’d split the creeper apart, cut up the parts, and chop it
into splinters. They’d dry the splinters in the wind and sun, burn
them with fire, and reduce them to ashes. Then they’d sweep away
the ashes in a strong wind, or float them away down a swift stream.
So those camel’s foot creepers would be cut off at the root, made
like a palm stump, and obliterated, unable to arise in the future. In
the same way, for such a person, bad unskillful qualities born of
greed, hate, and delusion are cut off at the root, made like a palm
stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. In this very
life they’re happy, free of distress, anguish, and fever, and they’re
also extinguished in this very life.
16.1 These are the three skillful roots.”

AN 3.70
##### Sabbath

_Uposathasutta_

1.1 So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near
Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern
Monastery.
1.3 Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, went up to the Buddha, bowed,
and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to her, “So, Visākhā,
where are you coming from in the middle of the day?”
1.5 “Today, sir, I’m observing the sabbath.”
2.1 “There are, Visākhā, these three sabbaths. What three? The
sabbath of the cowherds, the sabbath of the Jains, and the sabbath
of the noble ones.
And what is the sabbath of the cowherds? Its just like a cowherd 2.4
who, in the late afternoon, takes the cows back to their owners.
They reflect: ‘Today the cows grazed in this spot and that, and
they drank in this spot and that. Tomorrow the cows will graze
in this spot and that, and drink in this spot and that.’ In the same
way, someone keeping the sabbath reflects: ‘Today I ate this and
that, and had a meal of this and that. Tomorrow I’ll eat this and
that, and have a meal of this and that.’ And so they spend their
day with a mind full of covetousness. That’s the sabbath of the
cowherds. When the cowherd’s sabbath is observed like this it’s
not very fruitful or beneficial or splendid or bountiful.
And what is the sabbath of the Jains? There’s a kind of ascetic be- 3.1
longing to a group called the Jains. They encourage their disciples:
‘Please, good people, don’t hurt any living creatures more than a
hundred leagues away to the east. Don’t hurt any living creatures
more than a hundred leagues away to the west. Don’t hurt any
living creatures more than a hundred leagues away to the north.
Don’t hurt any living creatures more than a hundred leagues away
to the south.’ So they encourage kindness and sympathy for some
creatures and not others. On the sabbath, they encourage their
disciples: ‘Please, good people, take off all your clothes and say:
“I don’t belong to anyone anywhere! And nothing belongs to me
anywhere!”’ But their mother and father still know, ‘This is our
child.’ And they know, ‘This is my mother and father.’ Partner and
child still know, ‘This is our supporter.’ And they know, ‘This is
my partner and child.’ Bondservants, workers, and staff still know:
‘This is our master.’ And they know, ‘These are my bondservants,
workers, and staff.’ So, at a time when they should be encouraged
to speak the truth, the Jains encourage them to lie. This, I say, is
lying. When the night has passed they use their possessions once
more, though they’ve not been given back to them. This, I say, is
stealing. That’s the sabbath of the Jains. When the Jain’s sabbath is
observed like this it’s not very fruitful or beneficial or splendid or
bountiful.
4.1 And what is the sabbath of the noble ones? A corrupt mind is
cleaned by applying effort. And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by
applying effort? It’s when a noble disciple recollects the Realized
One: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world,
supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and
humans, awakened, blessed.’ As they recollect the Realized One,
their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are
given up. It’s just like cleaning a dirty head by applying effort.
5.1 And how is a dirty head cleaned by applying effort? With cleansing paste, clay, and water, and by applying the appropriate effort.
In the same way, a corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort.
6.1 And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort? It’s when
a noble disciple recollects the Realized One: ‘That Blessed One is
perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge
and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those
who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
As they recollect the Realized One, their mind becomes clear, joy
arises, and mental corruptions are given up. This is called: ‘A noble
disciple who observes the sabbath of the divinity, living together
with the divinity. And because they think of the divinity their
mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given
up.’ That’s how a corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort.
7.1 A corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort. And how is a
corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort? It’s when a noble disciple recollects the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by
the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective,
inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it
for themselves.’ As they recollect the teaching, their mind becomes
clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up. It’s just like
cleaning a dirty body by applying effort.
8.1 And how is a dirty body cleaned by applying effort? With
cleanser and powder, water, and by applying the appropriate effort.
That’s how a dirty body is cleaned by applying effort. In the same
way, a corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort.
And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort? Its 9.1
when a noble disciple recollects the teaching: ‘The teaching is
well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible
people can know it for themselves.’ As they recollect the teaching, their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions
are given up. This is called: ‘A noble disciple who observes the
sabbath of Dhamma, living together with Dhamma. And because
they think of the Dhamma their mind becomes clear, joy arises,
and mental corruptions are given up.’ That’s how a corrupt mind is
cleaned by applying effort.
A corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort. And how is a 10.1
corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort? It’s when a noble disciple
recollects the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is
practicing the way that’s good, sincere, systematic, and proper. It
consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha
oftheBuddha’sdisciplesthatisworthyofofferingsdedicatedtothe
gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy
of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit
for the world.’ As they recollect the Saṅgha, their mind becomes
clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up. It’s just like
cleaning a dirty cloth by applying effort.
And how is a dirty cloth cleaned by applying effort? With salt, 11.1
lye, cow dung, and water, and by applying the appropriate effort.
That’s how a dirty cloth is cleaned by applying effort. In the same
way, a corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort.
And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort? It’s when 12.1
a noble disciple recollects the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s
disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and
proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This
Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is worthy of offerings dedicated
to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation,
and worthy of veneration with joined palms. It is the supreme field
of merit for the world.’ As they recollect the Saṅgha, their mind
becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up.
This is called: A noble disciple who observes the sabbath of the
Saṅgha, living together with the Saṅgha. And because they think
of the Saṅgha their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental
corruptions are given up.’ That’s how a corrupt mind is cleaned by
applying effort.
13.1 A corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort. And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort? It’s when a noble disciple
recollects their own ethical conduct, which is intact, impeccable,
spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not
mistaken, and leading to immersion. As they recollect their ethical
conduct, their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up. It’s just like cleaning a dirty mirror by applying
effort.
14.1 And how is a dirty mirror cleaned by applying effort? With oil,
ash, a rolled-up cloth, andbyapplyingthe appropriateeffort. That’s
how a dirty mirror is cleaned by applying effort. In the same way, a
corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort.
15.1 And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort? It’s when
a noble disciple recollects their own ethical conduct, which is intact, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by
sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. As they
recollect their ethical conduct, their mind becomes clear, joy arises,
and mental corruptions are given up. This is called: ‘A noble disciple who observes the sabbath of ethical conduct, living together
with ethics. And because they think of their ethical conduct their
mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given
up.’ That’s how a corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort.
16.1 A corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort. And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort? It’s when a noble disciple
recollects the deities: ‘There are the gods of the four great kings,
the gods of the thirty-three, the gods of Yama, the joyful gods, the
gods who love to imagine, the gods who control what is imagined
by others, the gods of the Divinity’s host, and gods even higher
than these. When those deities passed away from here, they were
reborn there because of their faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and
wisdom. I, too, have the same kind of faith, ethics, learning, gen
erosity, and wisdom.’ As they recollect the faith, ethics, learning,
generosity, and wisdom of both themselves and those deities, their
mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given
up. It’s just like cleansing corrupt native gold by applying effort.
And how is corrupt native gold cleansed by applying effort? 17.1
With a furnace, flux, a blowpipe, and tongs, and by applying the
appropriate effort. That’s how corrupt native gold is cleansed by
applying effort. In the same way, a corrupt mind is cleaned by
applying effort.
And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort? It’s when 18.1
a noble disciple recollects the deities: ‘There are the gods of the
four great kings, the gods of the thirty-three, the gods of Yama,
the joyful gods, the gods who love to imagine, the gods who control what is imagined by others, the gods of the Divinity’s host,
and gods even higher than these. When those deities passed away
from here, they were reborn there because of their faith, ethics,
learning, generosity, and wisdom. I, too, have the same kind of
faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.’ As they recollect
the faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom of both themselves and those deities, their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and
mental corruptions are given up. This is called: ‘A noble disciple
who observes the sabbath of the deities, living together with the
deities. And because they think of the deities their mind becomes
clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up.’ That’s how a
corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort.
Then that noble disciple reflects: ‘As long as they live, the per- 19.1
fected ones give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and
the sword. They are scrupulous and kind, and live full of sympathy for all living beings. I, too, for this day and night will give up
killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. I’ll be
scrupulous and kind, and live full of sympathy for all living beings.
I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this
respect.
20.1 As long as they live, the perfected ones give up stealing. They
take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep
themselves clean by not thieving. I, too, for this day and night will
give up stealing. I’ll take only what’s given, and expect only what’s
given. I’ll keep myself clean by not thieving. I will observe the
sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.
21.1 As long as they live, the perfected ones give up unchastity. They
are celibate, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex. I, too, for this
day and night will give up unchastity. I will be celibate, set apart,
avoiding the vulgar act of sex. I will observe the sabbath by doing
as the perfected ones do in this respect.
22.1 As long as they live, the perfected ones give up lying. They speak
the truth and stick to the truth. They’re honest and trustworthy,
and don’t trick the world with their words. I, too, for this day and
night will give up lying. I’ll speak the truth and stick to the truth.
I’ll be honest and dependable, and won’t trick the world with my
words. I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones
do in this respect.
23.1 As long as they live, the perfected ones give up beer, wine, and
liquor intoxicants. I, too, for this day and night will give up beer,
wine, and liquor intoxicants. I will observe the sabbath by doing
as the perfected ones do in this respect.
24.1 As long as they live, the perfected ones eat in one part of the day,
abstaining from eating at night and from food at the wrong time. I,
too, for this day and night will eat in one part of the day, abstaining
from eating at night and food at the wrong time. I will observe the
sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.
25.1 As longastheylive, theperfectedonesrefrainfromseeingshows
ofdancing,singing,andmusic; andbeautifyingandadorningthemselves with garlands, fragrance, and makeup. I, too, for this day and
night will refrain from seeing shows of dancing, singing, and music
; and beautifying and adorning myself with garlands, fragrance,
and makeup. I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected
ones do in this respect.
As long as they live, the perfected ones give up high and luxuri 26.1
ous beds. They sleep in a low place, either a cot or a straw mat. I,
too, for this day and night will give up high and luxurious beds. I’ll
sleep in a low place, either a cot or a straw mat. I will observe the
sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.’
That’s the sabbath of the noble ones. When the sabbath of the 27.1
noble ones is observed like this it’s very fruitful and beneficial and
splendid and bountiful.
How much so? Suppose you were to rule as sovereign lord over 28.1
these sixteen great countries—Aṅga, Magadha, Kāsi, Kosala, Vajji,
Malla, Cetī, Vaccha, Kuru, Pañcāla, Maccha, Sūrasena, Assaka,
Avanti, Gandhāra, and Kamboja—full of the seven treasures. This
wouldn’t be worth a sixteenth part of the sabbath with its eight
factors. Why is that? Because human kingship is a poor thing
compared to the happiness of the gods.
Fifty years in the human realm is one day and night for the gods 29.1
of the four great kings. Thirty such days make up a month. Twelve
such months make up a year. The lifespan of the gods of the four
great kings is five hundred of these heavenly years. It’s possible
that some woman or man who has observed the eight-factored
sabbath will—when their body breaks up, after death—be reborn
in the company of the gods of the four great kings. This is what
I was referring to when I said: ‘Human kingship is a poor thing
compared to the happiness of the gods.’
A hundred years in the human realm is one day and night for 30.1
the gods of the thirty-three. Thirty such days make up a month.
Twelve such months make up a year. The lifespan of the gods of the
thirty-three is a thousand of these heavenly years. It’s possible that
some woman or man who has observed the eight-factored sabbath
will—when their body breaks up, after death—be reborn in the
company of the gods of the thirty-three. This is what I was referring
to when I said: ‘Human kingship is a poor thing compared to the
happiness of the gods.’
Two hundred years in the human realm is one day and night for 31.1
the gods of Yama. Thirty such days make up a month. Twelve such
months make up a year. The lifespan of the gods of Yama is two
thousand of these heavenly years. It’s possible that some woman
or man who has observed the eight-factored sabbath will—when
their body breaks up, after death—be reborn in the company of the
gods of Yama. This is what I was referring to when I said: ‘Human
kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.’
32.1 Four hundred years in the human realm is one day and night
for the joyful gods. Thirty such days make up a month. Twelve
such months make up a year. The lifespan of the joyful gods is four
thousand of these heavenly years. It’s possible that some woman
or man who has observed the eight-factored sabbath will—when
their body breaks up, after death—be reborn in the company of
the joyful gods. This is what I was referring to when I said: ‘Human
kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.’
33.1 Eight hundred years in the human realm is one day and night
for the gods who love to imagine. Thirty such days make up a
month. Twelve such months make up a year. The lifespan of the
gods who love to imagine is eight thousand of these heavenly years.
It’s possible that some woman or man who has observed the eightfactored sabbath will—when their body breaks up, after death—
be reborn in the company of the gods who love to imagine. This
is what I was referring to when I said: ‘Human kingship is a poor
thing compared to the happiness of the gods.’
34.1 Sixteen hundred years in the human realm is one day and night
for the gods who control what is imagined by others. Thirty such
days make up a month. Twelve such months make up a year. The
lifespan of the gods who control what is imagined by others is
sixteen thousand of these heavenly years. It’s possible that some
womanormanwhohasobservedtheeight-factoredsabbathwill—
when their body breaks up, after death—be reborn in the company
of the gods who control what is imagined by others. This is what
I was referring to when I said: ‘Human kingship is a poor thing
compared to the happiness of the gods.’

35.1 You shouldn’t kill living creatures, or steal,
or lie, or drink liquor.
Be celibate, refraining from sex,
and don’t eat at night, the wrong time.

Not wearing garlands or applying fragrance, 36.1
you should sleep on a low bed,
or a mat on the ground.
This is the eight-factored sabbath, they say,
explained by the Buddha,
who has gone to suffering’s end.

The moon and sun are both fair to see, 37.1
radiating as far as they revolve.
Those dispellers of darkness, travellers in midair,
shine in the firmament, lighting up the quarters.

All of the wealth that’s found in this realm— 38.1
pearls, gems, fine beryl too,
mountain gold or lustrous gold,
or the native gold called ‘coruscant’—

they’re not worth a sixteenth part 39.1
of the sabbath with its eight factors,
as starlight cannot rival the moon.

So an ethical woman or man, 40.1
who has observed the eight-factored sabbath,
having made merit whose outcome is happiness,
blameless, they go to a heavenly place.”
