# The Chapter on Persons

AN 3.21
##### With Saviṭṭha

_Samiddhasutta_

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near 1.1
Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Then Venerable Saviṭṭha and Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita went up 1.3
to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they 1.4
sat down to one side and Venerable Sāriputta said to Venerable
Saviṭṭha, “Reverend Saviṭṭha, these three people are found in the
world. What three? The direct witness, the one attained to view,
and the one freed by faith. These are the three people found in the
world. Of these three people, who do you believe to be the finest?”
“Reverend Sāriputta, these three people are found in the world. 3.1
What three? The direct witness, the one attained to view, and the
one freed by faith. These are the three people found in the world.
Ofthesethreepeople,Ibelievethepersonfreedbyfaithtobefinest.
Why is that? Because this person’s faculty of faith is outstanding.”
Then Sāriputta said to Mahākoṭṭhita, “Reverend Koṭṭhika, these 4.1
three people are found in the world. What three? The direct witness, the one attained to view, and the one freed by faith. These are
the three people found in the world. Of these three people, who
do you believe to be the finest?”
5.1 Reverend Sāriputta, these three people are found in the world.
What three? The direct witness, the one attained to view, and the
one freed by faith. These are the three people found in the world.
Of these three people, I believe the direct witness to be finest. Why
is that? Because this person’s faculty of immersion is outstanding.”
6.1 Then Mahākoṭṭhita said to Sāriputta, “Reverend Sāriputta, these
three people are found in the world. What three? The direct witness, the one attained to view, and the one freed by faith. These are
the three people found in the world. Of these three people, who
do you believe to be the finest?”
7.1 “Reverend Koṭṭhika, these three people are found in the world.
What three? The direct witness, the one attained to view, and the
one freed by faith. These are the three people found in the world.
Of these three people, I believe the person attained to view to be
finest. Why is that? Because this person’s faculty of wisdom is
outstanding.”
8.1 Then Sāriputta said to Saviṭṭha and Mahākoṭṭhita, “Each of us
hasspokenfromtheheart. Come,reverends,let’sgototheBuddha,
and tell him about this. As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”
8.5 “Yes, reverend,” they replied. Then Sāriputta, Saviṭṭha, and Mahākoṭṭhita went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one
side. Then Sāriputta told the Buddha of all they had discussed.
9.1 “In this matter, Sāriputta, it’s not easy to categorically declare
that one of these three people is finest. In some cases, a person who
is freed by faith is practicing for perfection, while the direct witness
and the one attained to view are once-returners or non-returners.
10.1 In this matter, it’s not easy to categorically declare that one of
thesethreepeopleisfinest. Insomecases,adirectwitnessispracticing for perfection, while the one freed by faith and the one attained
to view are once-returners or non-returners.
11.1 In this matter, it’s not easy to categorically declare that one of
these three people is finest. In some cases, one attained to view
is practicing for perfection, while the one freed by faith and the
direct witness are once-returners or non-returners.
In this matter, its not easy to categorically declare that one of 12.1
these three people is finest.”

AN 3.22
##### Patients

_Gilānasutta_

“These three patients are found in the world. What three? 1.1
In some cases a patient won’t recover from an illness, regardless 1.3
of whether or not they get suitable food and medicines, and a
capable carer.
In some cases a patient will recover from an illness, regardless of 2.1
whether or not they get suitable food and medicines, and a capable
carer.
In some cases a patient can recover from an illness, but only if 3.1
they get suitable food and medicines, and a capable carer, and not
if they don’t get these things.
Now, it’s for the sake of the last patient—who will recover only 4.1
if they get suitable food and medicines, and a capable carer—that
food, medicines, and a carer are prescribed. But also, for the sake
of this patient, the other patients should be looked after.
These are the three kinds of patients found in the world. 4.3
In the same way, these three people similar to patients are found 5.1
in the world. What three? Some people don’t enter the sure path
with regards to skillful qualities, regardless of whether or not they
get to see a Realized One, and to hear the teaching and training
that he proclaims.
Some people do enter the sure path with regards to skillful qual- 6.1
ities, regardless of whether or not they get to see a Realized One,
and to hear the teaching and training that he proclaims.
Some people can enter the sure path with regards to skillful 7.1
qualities, but only if they get to see a Realized One, and to hear the
teaching and training that he proclaims, and not when they don’t
get those things.
8.1 Now, its for the sake of this last person that teaching the
Dhamma is prescribed, that is, the one who can enter the sure
path with regards to skillful qualities, but only if they get to see a
Realized One, and to hear the teaching and training that he proclaims. Butalso, forthesakeofthisperson, theotherpeopleshould
be taught Dhamma.
8.3 These are the three people similar to patients found in the world.”

AN 3.23
##### Choices

_Saṅkhārasutta_

1.1 “These three people are found in the world. What three?
1.3 Firstly, a certain person makes hurtful choices by way of body,
speech, and mind. Having made these choices, they’re reborn in
a hurtful world, where hurtful contacts strike them. Touched by
hurtful contacts, they experience hurtful feelings that are exclusively painful—like the beings in hell.
2.1 Furthermore, another person makes pleasing choices by way
of body, speech, and mind. Having made these choices, they are
reborn in a pleasing world, where pleasing contacts strike them.
Touched by pleasing contacts, they experience pleasing feelings of
perfect happiness—like the gods of universal beauty.
3.1 Furthermore, another person makes both hurtful and pleasing
choices by way of body, speech, and mind. Having made these
choices, they are reborn in a world that is both hurtful and pleasing, where hurtful and pleasing contacts strike them. Touched by
both hurtful and pleasing contacts, they experience both hurtful
and pleasing feelings that are a mixture of pleasure and pain—like
humans, some gods, and some beings in the underworld.
3.5 These are the three people found in the world.”
AN 3.24
##### Very Helpful

_Bahukārasutta_

“Mendicants, these three people are very helpful to another. What 1.1
three?
The person who has enabled you to go for refuge to the Buddha, 1.3
theteaching,andtheSaṅgha. Thispersonisveryhelpfultoanother.
Furthermore, the person who has enabled you to truly under- 2.1
stand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This
is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to
the cessation of suffering’. This person is very helpful to another.
Furthermore, the person who has enabled you to realize the 3.1
undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very
life, and live having realized it with your own insight due to the
ending of defilements. This person is very helpful to another.
These are the three people who are very helpful to another per- 3.3
son.
And Isaythatthereis no-onemorehelpfultoanotherthanthese 4.1
three people. And I also say that it’s not easy to repay these three
people by bowing down to them, rising up for them, greeting them
with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette for them; or by
providing them with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and
supplies for the sick.”

AN 3.25
##### Like Diamond

_Vajirūpamasutta_

“These three people are found in the world. What three? A person 1.1
with a mind like an open sore, a person with a mind like lightning,
and a person with a mind like diamond.
And who has a mind like an open sore? It’s a person who is 1.4
irritable and bad-tempered. Even when lightly criticized they lose
their temper, becoming annoyed, hostile, and hard hearted, and
theydisplayannoyance,hate,andbitterness. They’relikeafestering
sore, which, when you hit it with a stick or a stone, discharges even
more. Inthesameway,apersonisirritableandbad-tempered. Even
when lightly criticized they lose their temper, becoming annoyed,
hostile, and hard-hearted, and they display annoyance, hate, and
bitterness. This is called a person with a mind like an open sore.
2.1 And who has a mind like lightning? It’s a person who truly
understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’
… ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that
leads to the cessation of suffering’. They’re like a person with keen
eyes in the dark of the night, who sees by a flash of lightning. In the
same way, a person truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This
is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ …
‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. This is
called a person with a mind like lightning.
3.1 And who has a mind like diamond? It’s a person who realizes
the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very
life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due
to the ending of defilements. It’s like a diamond, which can’t be
cut by anything at all, not even a gem or a stone. In the same way,
a person realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by
wisdom in this very life. … This is called a person with a mind like
diamond.
3.6 These are the three people found in the world.”

AN 3.26
##### Associates

_Sevitabbasutta_

1.1 “These three people are found in the world. What three? There is a
personyoushouldn’tassociatewith, accompany, orattend. Thereis
a person you should associate with, accompany, and attend. There
is a person you should associate with, accompany, and attend with
honor and respect.
Who is the person you shouldn’t associate with, accompany, or 1.6
attend? It’s a person who is inferior in terms of ethics, immersion,
and wisdom. You shouldn’t associate with, accompany, or attend
such a person, except out of kindness and sympathy.
Who is the person you should associate with, accompany, and 2.1
attend? It’s a person who is similar in terms of ethics, immersion,
and wisdom. You should associate with, accompany, and attend
such a person. Why is that? Thinking, ‘Since our ethical conduct is
similar, we can discuss ethics, the conversation will flow, and we’ll
both be at ease. Since our immersion is similar, we can discuss immersion, the conversation will flow, and we’ll both be at ease. Since
our wisdom is similar, we can discuss wisdom, the conversation
will flow, and we’ll both be at ease.’ That’s why you should associate
with, accompany, and attend such a person.
Who is the person you should associate with, accompany, and 3.1
attend with honor and respect? It’s a person who is superior in
terms of ethics, immersion, and wisdom. You should associate
with, accompany, and attend such a person with honor and respect.
Why is that? Thinking, ‘I’ll fulfill the entire spectrum of ethical
conduct I haven’t yet fulfilled, or support with wisdom in every
situation the ethical conduct I’ve already fulfilled. I’ll fulfill the
entire spectrum of immersion I haven’t yet fulfilled, or support
with wisdom in every situation the immersion I’ve already fulfilled.
I’ll fulfill the entire spectrum of wisdom I haven’t yet fulfilled, or
support with wisdom in every situation the wisdom I’ve already
fulfilled.’ That’s why you should associate with, accompany, and
attend this person with honor and respect.
These are the three people found in the world. 3.9

A man who associates with an inferior goes downhill, 4.1
but associating with an equal, you’ll never decline;
following the best, you’ll quickly rise up,
so you should keep company
with people better than you.”
AN 3.27
##### You Should be Disgusted

_Jigucchitabbasutta_

1.1 “These three people are found in the world. What three? There
is a person who you should be disgusted by, and you shouldn’t
associate with, accompany, or attend them. There is a person you
should regard with equanimity, and you shouldn’t associate with,
accompany, or attend them. There is a person you should associate
with, accompany, and attend.
1.6 Who is the person you should be disgusted by, and not associate
with, accompany, or attend? It’s a person who is unethical, of
bad qualities, filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true
ascetic or spiritual practitioner—though claiming to be one—
rotten inside, festering, and depraved. You should be disgusted by
such a person, and you shouldn’t associate with, accompany, or
attend them. Why is that? Even if you don’t follow the example of
such a person, you still get a bad reputation: ‘That individual has
bad friends, companions, and associates.’ They’re like a snake that’s
been living in a pile of dung. Even if it doesn’t bite, it’ll still rub off
on you. In the same way, even if you don’t follow the example of
such a person, you still get a bad reputation: ‘That individual has
bad friends, companions, and associates.’ That’s why you should
be disgusted by such a person, and you shouldn’t associate with,
accompany, or attend them.
2.1 Who is the person you should regard with equanimity, and not
associate with, accompany, or attend? It’s a person who is irritable
and bad-tempered. Even when lightly criticized they lose their
temper, becoming annoyed, hostile, and hard-hearted, and they
display annoyance, hate, and bitterness. They’re like a festering
sore, which, when you hit it with a stick or a stone, discharges even
more. In the same way, someone is irritable and bad-tempered.
They’re like a firebrand of pale-moon ebony, which, when you hit it
with a stick or a stone, sizzles and crackles even more. In the same
way, someone is irritable and bad tempered. They re like a sewer,
which, when you stir it with a stick or a stone, stinks even more.
In the same way, a person is irritable and bad-tempered. Even
when lightly criticized they lose their temper, becoming annoyed,
hostile, and hard-hearted, and they display annoyance, hate, and
bitterness. You should regard such a person with equanimity, and
you shouldn’t associate with, accompany, or attend them. Why is
that? Thinking, ‘They might abuse or insult me, or do me harm.’
That’s why you should regard such a person with equanimity, and
you shouldn’t associate with, accompany, or attend them.
Who is the person you should associate with, accompany, and 3.1
attend? It’s a person who is ethical, of good character. You should
associate with, accompany, and attend such a person. Why is that?
Even if you don’t follow the example of such a person, you still get
a good reputation: ‘That individual has good friends, companions,
and associates.’ That’s why you should associate with, accompany,
and attend such a person.
These are the three people found in the world. 3.8

A man who associates with an inferior goes downhill, 4.1
but associating with an equal, you’ll never decline;
following the best, you’ll quickly rise up,
so you should keep company
with people better than you.”

AN 3.28
##### Speech like Dung

_Gūthabhāṇīsutta_

“These three people are found in the world. What three? One with 1.1
speechlikedung,onewithspeechlikeflowers,andonewithspeech
like honey.
And who has speech like dung? It’s a person who is summoned 1.4
to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal
court, and asked to bear witness: ‘Please, mister, say what you
know. Not knowing, they say I know. Knowing, they say I don t
know.’ Not seeing, they say ‘I see.’ And seeing, they say ‘I don’t see.’
So they deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another, or
for some trivial worldly reason. This is called a person with speech
like dung.
2.1 And whohasspeechlikeflowers? It’sapersonwhoissummoned
to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal
court, and asked to bear witness: ‘Please, mister, say what you
know.’ Not knowing, they say ‘I don’t know.’ Knowing, they say
‘I know.’ Not seeing, they say ‘I don’t see.’ And seeing, they say
‘I see.’ So they don’t deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or
another, or for some trivial worldly reason. This is called a person
with speech like flowers.
3.1 And who has speech like honey? It’s a person who gives up
harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the
ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the
people. This is called a person with speech like honey.
3.5 These are the three people found in the world.”

AN 3.29
##### Blind

_Andhasutta_

1.1 “These three people are found in the world. What three? The blind,
the one-eyed, and the two-eyed.
1.4 Who is the blind person? It’s someone who doesn’t have the
kind of vision that’s needed to acquire more wealth or to increase
the wealth they’ve already acquired. Nor do they have the kind of
vision that’s needed to know the difference between qualities that
are skillful and unskillful, blameworthy and blameless, inferior and
superior, and those on the side of dark and bright. This is called a
blind person.
2.1 Who is the person with one eye? It’s someone who has the kind
of vision that’s needed to acquire more wealth and to increase the
wealth they ve already acquired. But they don t have the kind of
vision that’s needed to know the difference between qualities that
are skillful and unskillful, blameworthy and blameless, inferior and
superior, and those on the side of dark and bright. This is called a
one-eyed person.
Who is the person with two eyes? It’s someone who has the 3.1
kind of vision that’s needed to acquire more wealth and to increase
the wealth they’ve already acquired. And they have the kind of
vision that’s needed to know the difference between skillful and
unskillful, blameworthy and blameless, inferior and superior, or
qualities on the side of dark and bright. This is called a two-eyed
person.
These are the three people found in the world. 3.6

Neither suitable wealth, 4.1
nor merit do they make.
They hold a losing hand on both counts,
those who are blind, with ruined eyes.

And now the one-eyed 5.1
person is explained.
By methods good and bad,
that devious person seeks wealth.

Both by fraudulent, thieving deeds, 6.1
and also by lies,
the young man’s skilled at piling up money,
and enjoying sensual pleasures.
From here they go to hell—
the one-eyed person is ruined.

And now the two-eyed is explained, 7.1
the best individual.
Their wealth is earned legitimately,
money acquired by their own hard work.

They give with best of intentions, 8.1
that peaceful hearted person.
They go to a good place,
where there is no sorrow.

9.1 The blind and the one-eyed,
you should avoid from afar.
But you should keep the two-eyed close,
the best individual.”

AN 3.30
##### Upside-down

_Avakujjasutta_

1.1 “These three people are found in the world. What three? One with
upside-down wisdom, one with wisdom on their lap, and one with
widespread wisdom.
1.4 And who is the person with upside-down wisdom? It’s a person who often goes to the monastery to hear the teaching in the
presence of the mendicants. The mendicants teach them Dhamma
that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the
end, meaningful and well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. But even while sitting there, that
person doesn’t apply the mind to the beginning, middle, or end of
the discussion. And when they get up from their seat, they don’t
apply the mind to the beginning, middle, or end of the discussion.
It’s like when a pot full of water is tipped over, so the water drains
out and doesn’t stay. In the same way, a person often goes to the
monastery to hear the teaching in the presence of the mendicants.
The mendicants teach them Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and
well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full
and pure. But even while sitting there, that person doesn’t apply
the mind to the discussion in the beginning, middle, or end. And
when they get up from their seat, they don’t apply the mind to the
beginning, middle, or end of the discussion. This is called a person
with upside-down wisdom.
And who is the person with wisdom on their lap? It’s a person 2.1
who often goes to the monastery to hear the teaching in the presence of the mendicants. The mendicants teach them Dhamma
that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the
end, meaningful and well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. While sitting there, that person
applies the mind to the discussion in the beginning, middle, and
end. But when they get up from their seat, they don’t apply the
mind to the beginning, middle, or end of the discussion. It’s like a
person who has different kinds of food crammed on their lap—
such as sesame, rice, sweets, or jujube—so that if they get up from
the seat without mindfulness, everything gets scattered. In the
same way, a person often goes to the monastery to hear the teaching in the presence of the mendicants. The mendicants teach them
Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and
good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And they reveal a
spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. While sitting there,
that person applies the mind to the discussion in the beginning,
middle, and end. But when they get up from their seat, they don’t
apply the mind to the beginning, middle, or end of the discussion.
This is called a person with wisdom on their lap.
And who is the person with widespread wisdom? It’s a person 3.1
who often goes to the monastery to hear the teaching in the presence of the mendicants. The mendicants teach them Dhamma
that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the
end, meaningful and well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. While sitting there, that person
applies the mind to the discussion in the beginning, middle, and
end. And when they get up from their seat, they continue to apply the mind to the beginning, middle, or end of the discussion.
It’s like when a pot full of water is set straight, so the water stays
and doesn’t drain out. In the same way, a person often goes to
the monastery to hear the teaching in the presence of the mendicants. The mendicants teach them Dhamma thats good in the
beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful
and well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely
full and pure. While sitting there, that person applies the mind
to the discussion in the beginning, middle, and end. And when
they get up from their seat, they continue to apply the mind to the
beginning, middle, or end of the discussion. This is called a person
with widespread wisdom.
3.12 These are the three people found in the world.

4.1 A person with upside-down wisdom,
is a simpleton and cannot see,
and even if they frequently
go into the mendicants’ presence,

5.1 such a person can’t learn
the beginning, middle, or end
of the discussion,
for their wisdom is lacking.

6.1 The person with wisdom on their lap
is better than that, it’s said;
but even if they frequently
go into the mendicants’ presence,

7.1 such a person can only learn
the beginning, middle, and end
while sitting in that seat;
but they’ve only grasped the phrasing,
for when they get up their understanding fails,
and what they’ve learned is lost.

8.1 The person with widespread wisdom
is better than that, it’s said;
and if they, too, frequently
go into the mendicants’ presence,
such a person can learn 9.1
the beginning, middle, and end
while sitting in that seat;
and when they’ve grasped the phrasing,

they remember it with the best of intentions. 10.1
That peaceful-hearted person,
practicing in line with the teaching,
would make an end of suffering.”
