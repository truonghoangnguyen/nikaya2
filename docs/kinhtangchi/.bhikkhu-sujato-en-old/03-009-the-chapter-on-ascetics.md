# The Chapter on Ascetics

AN 3.81
##### Ascetics

_Samaṇasutta_

“Mendicants, there are three duties of an ascetic. What three? Un- 1.1
dertaking the training in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and
the higher wisdom. These are the three duties of an ascetic.
So you should train like this: ‘We will have keen enthusiasm for 2.1
undertaking the training in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and
the higher wisdom.’ That’s how you should train.”

AN 3.82
##### The Donkey

_Gadrabhasutta_

“Suppose, mendicants, a donkey followed behind a herd of cattle, 1.1
thinking: ‘I can moo too! I can moo too!’ But it doesn’t look like
a cow, or sound like a cow, or leave a footprint like a cow. Still it
follows behind a herd of cattle, thinking: ‘I can moo too! I can
moo too!’
In the same way, some mendicant follows behind the mendicant 2.1
Saṅgha, thinking: ‘I’m a monk too! I’m a monk too!’ But they
don’t have the same enthusiasm for undertaking the training in
the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom as the
other mendicants. Still they follow behind the mendicant Saṇgha,
thinking: ‘I’m a monk too! I’m a monk too!’
3.1 So you should train like this: ‘We will have keen enthusiasm for
undertaking the training in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and
the higher wisdom.’ That’s how you should train.”

AN 3.83
##### Fields

_Khettasutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, a farmer has three primary duties. What three? A
farmer first of all makes sure the field is well ploughed and tilled.
Next they plant seeds in season. When the time is right, they
irrigate the field and then drain it. These are the three primary
duties of a farmer.
2.1 In the same way, a mendicant has three primary duties. What
three? Undertaking the training in the higher ethics, the higher
mind, and the higher wisdom. These are the three primary duties
of a mendicant.
3.1 So you should train like this: ‘We will have keen enthusiasm for
undertaking the training in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and
the higher wisdom.’ That’s how you should train.”

AN 3.84
##### The Vajji

_Vajjiputtasutta_

1.1 At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood,
in the hall with the peaked roof. Then a certain Vajji monk went
up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
1.3 “Sir, each fortnight over a hundred and fifty training rules are
recited. I’m not able to train in them.”
1.5 “But monk, are you able to train in three trainings: the higher
ethics, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom?”
I am, sir. 1.7
“So, monk, you should train in these three trainings: the higher 1.9
ethics, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom.
As you train in these, you will give up greed, hate, and delusion. 2.1
Then you won’t do anything unskillful, or practice anything bad.”
After some time that monk trained in the higher ethics, the 3.1
higher mind, and the higher wisdom. He gave up greed, hate,
and delusion. Then he didn’t do anything unskillful, or practice
anything bad.

AN 3.85
##### A Trainee

_Sekkhasutta_

Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one 1.1
side, and said to him:
“Sir, they speak of this person called ‘a trainee’. How is a trainee 2.1
defined?”
“They train,mendicant,that’swhythey’recalled‘atrainee’. What 2.3
is their training? They train in the higher ethics, the higher mind,
and the higher wisdom. They train, that’s why they’re called ‘a
trainee’.

As a trainee trains, 3.1
following the straight road,
first they know about ending;
enlightenment follows in the same lifetime.

Then the knowledge comes 4.1
such a one, freed through enlightenment,
with the end of the fetters of continued existence:
‘My freedom is unshakable.’”
AN 3.86
##### Training (1st)

_Paṭhamasikkhāsutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, each fortnight over a hundred and fifty training rules
come up for recitation, in which gentlemen who care for their own
welfare train. These are all included in the three trainings. What
three? The training in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the
higher wisdom. These are the three trainings that include them all.
2.1 Take the case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics, but
has limited immersion and wisdom. They break some lesser and
minor training rules, but are restored. Why is that? Because I don’t
say they’re incapable of that. But they’re constant and steady in
their precepts regarding the training rules that are fundamental,
befittingthespiritualpath. Theykeeptherulesthey’veundertaken.
With the ending of three fetters they’re a stream-enterer, not liable
to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.
3.1 Take another case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics,
but has limited immersion and wisdom. They break some lesser
and minor training rules, but are restored. Why is that? Because I
don’t say they’re incapable of that. But they’re constant and steady
in their precepts regarding the training rules that are fundamental,
befittingthespiritualpath. Theykeeptherulesthey’veundertaken.
With the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate,
and delusion, they’re a once-returner. They come back to this
world once only, then make an end of suffering.
4.1 Take another case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics
and immersion, but has limited wisdom. They break some lesser
and minor training rules, but are restored. Why is that? Because I
don’t say they’re incapable of that. But they’re constant and steady
in their precepts regarding the training rules that are fundamental,
befitting the spiritual path. They keep the rules they’ve undertaken. With the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn
spontaneously. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to
return from that world.
Take another case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics, 5.1
immersion, and wisdom. They break some lesser and minor training rules, but are restored. Why is that? Because I don’t say they’re
incapable of that. But they’re constant and steady in their precepts
regarding the training rules that are fundamental, befitting the spiritual path. They keep the rules they’ve undertaken. They realize
the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very
life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to
the ending of defilements.
So, mendicants, if you practice partially you succeed partially. If 6.1
you practice fully you succeed fully. These training rules are not a
waste, I say.”

AN 3.87
##### Training (2nd)

_Dutiyasikkhāsutta_

“Mendicants, each fortnight over a hundred and fifty training rules 1.1
come up for recitation, in which gentlemen who care for their own
welfare train. These are all included in the three trainings. What
three? The training in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the
higher wisdom. These are the three trainings that include them all.
Take the case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics, but 2.1
has limited immersion and wisdom. They break some lesser and
minor training rules, but are restored. Why is that? Because I don’t
say they’re incapable of that. But they’re constant and steady in
their precepts regarding the training rules that are fundamental,
befitting the spiritual life. They keep the rules they’ve undertaken.
With the ending of three fetters they have at most seven rebirths.
They will transmigrate at most seven times among gods and humans and then make an end of suffering. With the ending of three
fetters, they go from family to family. They will transmigrate between two or three families and then make an end of suffering.
With the ending of three fetters, they’re a one-seeder. They will be
reborn just one time in a human existence, then make an end of
suffering. With the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of
greed, hate, and delusion, they’re a once-returner. They come back
to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.
3.1 Take another case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics
and immersion, but has limited wisdom. They break some lesser
and minor training rules, but are restored. Why is that? Because I
don’t say they’re incapable of that. But they’re constant and steady
in their precepts regarding the training rules that are fundamental,
befittingthespiritualpath. Theykeeptherulesthey’veundertaken.
With the ending of the five lower fetters they head upstream, going
to the Akaniṭṭha realm. With the ending of the five lower fetters
they’re extinguished with extra effort. With the ending of the five
lower fetters they’re extinguished without extra effort. With the
ending of the five lower fetters they’re extinguished upon landing. With the ending of the five lower fetters they’re extinguished
between one life and the next.
4.1 Take another case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics,
immersion, and wisdom. They break some lesser and minor training rules, but are restored. Why is that? Because I don’t say they’re
incapable of that. But they’re constant and steady in their precepts
regarding the training rules that are fundamental, befitting the spiritual path. They keep the rules they’ve undertaken. They realize
the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very
life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to
the ending of defilements.
5.1 So, mendicants, if you practice partially you succeed partially. If
you practice fully you succeed fully. These training rules are not a
waste, I say.”

##### Training (3rd)

_Tatiyasikkhāsutta_

“Mendicants, each fortnight over a hundred and fifty training rules 1.1
come up for recitation, in which gentlemen who care for their own
welfare train. These are all included in the three trainings. What
three? The training in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the
higher wisdom. These are the three trainings that include them all.
Take the case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics, im- 2.1
mersion, and wisdom. They break some lesser and minor training
rules, but are restored. Why is that? Because I don’t say they’re
incapable of that. But they’re constant and steady in their precepts regarding the training rules that are fundamental, befitting
the spiritual path. They keep the rules they’ve undertaken.
They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by 2.6
wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their
own insight due to the ending of defilements.
If they don’t penetrate so far, with the ending of the five lower 2.7
fetters they’re extinguished between one life and the next.
If they don’t penetrate so far, with the ending of the five lower 2.8
fetters they’re extinguished upon landing.
If they don’t penetrate so far, with the ending of the five lower 2.9
fetters they’re extinguished without extra effort.
If they don’t penetrate so far, with the ending of the five lower 2.10
fetters they’re extinguished with extra effort.
If they don’t penetrate so far, with the ending of the five lower 2.11
fetters they head upstream, going to the Akaniṭṭha realm.
If they don’t penetrate so far, with the ending of three fetters, 2.12
and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, they’re a oncereturner. They come back to this world once only, then make an
end of suffering.
2.13 If they don t penetrate so far, with the ending of three fetters,
they’re a one-seeder. They will be reborn just one time in a human
existence, then make an end of suffering.
2.14 If they don’t penetrate so far, with the ending of three fetters,
they go from family to family. They will transmigrate between two

##### Three Trainings (1st)

_Paṭhamasikkhattayasutta_

1.1 “Mendicants, thesearethethreetrainings. Whatthree? Thetraining
in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom.
2.1 And what is the training in the higher ethics? It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger
in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. This
is called the training in the higher ethics.
3.1 And what is the training in the higher mind? It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second
absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. This is called
the training in the higher mind.
4.1 And what is the training in the higher wisdom? They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ …
‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads
to the cessation of suffering. This is called the training in the higher
wisdom. These are the three trainings.”

AN 3.90
##### Three Trainings (2nd)

_Dutiyasikkhattayasutta_

“Mendicants, thesearethethreetrainings. Whatthree? Thetraining 1.1
in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom.
And what is the training in the higher ethics? It’s when a mendi- 2.1
cant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger
in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. This
is called the training in the higher ethics.
And what is the training in the higher mind? It’s when a mendi- 3.1
cant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second
absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. This is called
the training in the higher mind.
And what is the training in the higher wisdom? It’s when a 4.1
mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom
by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with
their own insight due to the ending of defilements. This is called
the training in the higher wisdom. These are the three trainings.

The higher ethics, the higher mind, 5.1
and the higher wisdom should be practiced
by those energetic, steadfast, and resolute,
practicing absorption, mindful, with guarded senses.

As before, so behind; 6.1
as behind, so before.
As below, so above;
as above, so below.
7.1 As by day, so by night;
as by night, so by day.
Having mastered every direction
with limitless immersion,

8.1 they call them a ‘trainee on the path’,
and ‘one living a pure life’.
But a wise one who has gone to the end of the path
they call a ‘Buddha’ in the world.

9.1 With the cessation of consciousness,
freed by the ending of craving,
the liberation of their heart
is like a lamp going out.”

AN 3.91
##### At Paṅkadhā

_Saṅkavāsutta_

1.1 At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans
together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. He arrived at a town
of the Kosalans named Paṅkadhā, and stayed there.
1.3 Now, at that time a monk called Kassapagotta was resident at
Paṅkadhā. There the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and
inspired the mendicants with a Dhamma talk about the training
rules. Kassapagotta became quite impatient and bitter, thinking,
“This ascetic is much too strict.”
1.7 When the Buddha had stayed in Paṅkadhā as long as he pleased,
he set out for Rājagaha. Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at
Rājagaha, and stayed there.
2.1 Soon after the Buddha left, Kassapagotta became quite remorseful and regretful, thinking, “It’s my loss, my misfortune, that when
the Buddha was talking about the training rules I became quite
impatient and bitter, thinking he was much too strict. Why don’t I
go to the Buddha and confess my mistake to him?”
Then Kassapagotta set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl 2.6
and robe, set out for Rājagaha. Eventually he came to Rājagaha and
the Vulture’s Peak. He went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to
one side, and told him what had happened, saying:
“I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful 3.1
of me to become impatient and bitter when the Buddha was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a
Dhamma talk about the training rules, and to think, ‘This ascetic is
much too strict.’ Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I
will restrain myself in future.”
“Indeed, Kassapa, you made a mistake. But since you have rec- 4.1
ognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly,
I accept it. For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to
recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit
to restraint in the future.
Kassapa, take the case of a senior mendicant who doesn’t want 5.1
to train and doesn’t praise taking up the training. They don’t encourage other mendicants who don’t want to train to take up the
training. And they don’t truthfully and correctly praise at the right
time those mendicants who do want to train. I don’t praise that
kind of senior mendicant. Why is that? Because, hearing that I
praised that mendicant, other mendicants might want to keep company with them. Then they might follow their example, which
would be for their lasting harm and suffering. That’s why I don’t
praise that kind of senior mendicant.
Take the case of a middle mendicant who doesn’t want to train 6.1
…
Take the case of a junior mendicant who doesn’t want to train 6.2
… That’s why I don’t praise that kind of junior mendicant.
Kassapa, take the case of a senior mendicant who does want to 7.1
train and praises taking up the training. They encourage other mendicants who don’t want to train to take up the training. And they
truthfully and correctly praise at the right time those mendicants
who do want to train. I praise that kind of senior mendicant. Why
is that? Because, hearing that I praised that mendicant, other mendicants might want to keep company with them. Then they might
follow their example, which would be for their lasting welfare and
happiness. That’s why I praise that kind of senior mendicant.
8.1 Take the case of a middle mendicant who wants to train …
8.2 Take the case of a junior mendicant who wants to train … That’s
why I praise that kind of junior mendicant.”
