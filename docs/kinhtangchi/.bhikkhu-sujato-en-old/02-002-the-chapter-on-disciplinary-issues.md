“There are, mendicants, these two powers. What two? The power of 1.1
reflectionandthepowerofdevelopment. Andwhat, mendicants, is
the power of reflection? It’s when someone reflects: ‘Bad conduct
of body, speech, or mind has a bad, painful result in both this life
and the next.’ Reflecting like this, they give up bad conduct by way
of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of
body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure. This is called
the power of reflection.
And what, mendicants, is the power of development? In this 2.1
context, the power of development is the power of the trainees. For
when you rely on the power of a trainee, you give up greed, hate,
and delusion. Then you don’t do anything unskillful, or practice
anything bad. This is called the power of development. These are
the two powers.”

2.1 And what, mendicants, is the power of development? It’s when
a mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion,
and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. This is called the power of development. These are the two powers.”

2.1 And what, mendicants, is the power of development? It’s when
a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption,
which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the
mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and
keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the secondabsorption, whichhastheraptureandblissbornofimmersion,
with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind
and keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture,
they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate
with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the
bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful,
one meditates in bliss. Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending
former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth
absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and
mindfulness. This is called the power of development. These are
the two powers.”

“Mendicants, the Realized One has two ways of teaching the 1.1
Dhamma. What two? In brief and in detail. These are the Realized One’s two ways of teaching the Dhamma.”

“Mendicants, in a disciplinary issue, if neither the offending men- 1.1
dicant nor the accusing mendicant carefully checks themselves,
you can expect that issue will lead to lasting acrimony and enmity,
and the mendicants won’t live comfortably. But in a disciplinary
issue, if both the offending mendicant and the accusing mendicant carefully check themselves, you can expect that issue won’t
lead to lasting acrimony and enmity, and the mendicants will live
comfortably.
And how, mendicants, does an offending mendicant carefully 2.1
check themselves? An offending mendicant reflects: ‘I have committed a certain unskillful offense with the body. That mendicant
saw me do this. If I hadn’t committed that offense, they wouldn’t
have seen me. But since I did commit that offense, they did see
me. When they saw me, they were upset, and they voiced their
unhappiness to me. Then I also got upset, so I told others. So
the mistake is mine alone, like someone who owes customs duty
on their goods.’ That’s how, mendicants, an offending mendicant
carefully checks themselves.
And how, mendicants, does an accusing mendicant carefully 3.1
check themselves? An accusing mendicant reflects: ‘This mendicant has committed a certain unskillful offense with the body. I
saw them do that. If they hadn’t committed that offense, I wouldn’t
have seen them. But since they did commit that offense, I did see
them. When I saw them, I was upset, and I voiced my unhappiness
to them. Then they also got upset, so they told others. So the mistake is mine alone, like someone who owes customs duty on their
goods.’ That’s how, mendicants, an accusing mendicant carefully
checks themselves.
4.1 In adisciplinaryissue, ifneithertheoffendingmendicantnorthe
accusing mendicant carefully checks themselves, you can expect
that issue will lead to lasting acrimony and enmity, and the mendicants won’t live comfortably. But in a disciplinary issue, if both
the offending mendicant and the accusing mendicant carefully
checks themselves, you can expect that issue won’t lead to lasting
acrimony and enmity, and the mendicants will live comfortably.”

1.1 Then a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha and exchanged
greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation
were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:
1.3 “What isthecause, MisterGotama, whatisthereasonwhysome
sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn
in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell?”
1.4 “Unprincipled and immoral conduct is the reason why some
sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn
in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.”
2.1 “What isthecause, MisterGotama, whatisthereasonwhysome
sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn
in a good place, a heavenly realm?”
2.2 “Principled and moral conduct is the reason why some sentient
beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good
place, a heavenly realm.”
3.1 “Excellent, Mister Gotama! Excellent! As if he was righting the
overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to
the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes
can see what’s there, Mister Gotama has made the teaching clear in
many ways. I go for refuge to Mister Gotama, to the teaching, and
to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Mister Gotama
remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

Then thebrahminJānussoṇiwentuptotheBuddha,andexchanged 1.1
greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation
were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:
“What isthecause, MisterGotama, whatisthereasonwhysome 1.3
sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn
in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell?”
“What they’ve done and what they’ve not done. That’s why 1.4
some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are
reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.”
“But what is the cause, Mister Gotama, what is the reason why 1.6
some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are
reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm?”
“What they’ve done and what they’ve not done. That’s why 1.7
some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are
reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.”
“I don’t understand the meaning of what Mister Gotama has 1.9
said in brief, without explaining the details. Mister Gotama, please
teach me this matter in detail so I can understand the meaning.”
“Well then, brahmin, listen and apply your mind well, I will 1.11
speak.”
“Yes sir,” Jānussoṇi replied. The Buddha said this: 1.12
“Firstly, brahmin, someone has done bad things and not done 2.1
good things by way of body, speech, and mind. So what they’ve
doneandwhatthey’venotdoneiswhysomesentientbeings, when
their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad
place, the underworld, hell. Furthermore, brahmin, someone has
done good things and not done bad things by way of body, speech,
and mind. So what they’ve done and what they’ve not done is why
some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are
reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.”
3.1 “Excellent, Mister Gotama! … From this day forth, may Mister
Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge
for life.”

1.1 Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat
down to one side. The Buddha said to him, “Ānanda, I absolutely
say that you should not do bad things by way of body, speech, and
mind.”
1.3 “But, sir, if someone does these things that should not be done,
what drawbacks should they expect?”
1.4 “They should expect these drawbacks. They blame themselves.
After examination, sensible people criticize them. They get a bad
reputation. They feel lost when they die. And when their body
breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place,
the underworld, hell. These are the drawbacks they should expect.”
2.1 “Ānanda, I absolutely say that you should do good things by way
of body, speech, and mind.”
2.2 “But, sir, if someone does these things that should be done, what
benefits should they expect?”
2.3 “They should expect these benefits. They don’t blame themselves. After examination, sensible people praise them. They get
a good reputation. They don’t feel lost when they die. And when
the body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a good place, a
heavenly realm. These are the benefits they should expect.”

1.1 “Mendicants, give up the unskillful. It is possible to give up the unskillful. If it wasn’t possible, I wouldn’t say: ‘Give up the unskillful.’
But it is possible, and so I say: ‘Give up the unskillful.’ And if giving
up the unskillful led to harm and suffering, I would not say: ‘Give
up the unskillful. But giving up the unskillful leads to welfare and
happiness, so I say: ‘Give up the unskillful.’
Mendicants, develop the skillful. It is possible to develop the 2.1
skillful. If it wasn’t possible, I wouldn’t say: ‘Develop the skillful.’
But it is possible, and so I say: ‘Develop the skillful.’ If developing
the skillful led to harm and suffering I wouldn’t say: ‘Develop the
skillful.’ But developing the skillful leads to welfare and happiness,
so I say: ‘Develop the skillful.’”

“These two things, mendicants, lead to the decline and disappear- 1.1
ance of the true teaching. What two? The words and phrases are
misplaced, and the meaning is misinterpreted. When the words
and phrases are misplaced, the meaning is misinterpreted. These
two things lead to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching.
These two things lead to the continuation, persistence, and en- 2.1
during of the true teaching. What two? The words and phrases are
well organized, and the meaning is correctly interpreted. When
the words and phrases are well organized, the meaning is correctly
interpreted. These two things lead to the continuation, persistence,
and enduring of the true teaching.”
