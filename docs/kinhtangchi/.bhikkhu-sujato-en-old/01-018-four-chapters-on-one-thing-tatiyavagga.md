###### 316

1.1 “One person, mendicants, arises in the world for the detriment and
suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm, detriment,
and suffering of gods and humans. What one person? Someone
with wrong view, whose perspective is distorted. They draw many
people away from the true teaching and establish them in false
teachings. This is one person who arises in the world for the detriment and suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm,
detriment, and suffering of gods and humans.”

###### 317

1.1 “One person, mendicants, arises in the world for the welfare and
happiness of the people, for the people, for the benefit, welfare,
and happiness of gods and humans. What one person? Someone
with right view, whose perspective is undistorted. They draw many
people away from false teachings and establish them in the true
teaching. This is one person who arises in the world for the welfare
and happiness of the people, for the people, for the benefit, welfare,
and happiness of gods and humans.”

###### 318

“Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that is so very blameworthy 1.1
as wrong view. Wrong view is the most blameworthy thing of all.”

###### 319

“Mendicants, I do not see a single other person who acts for the 1.1
detriment and suffering of the people, against the people, for the
harm, detriment, and suffering of gods and humans, as that futile
man, the bamboo-staffed ascetic. Just as a trap set at the mouth
of a river would bring harm, suffering, calamity, and disaster for
many fish, so too that futile man, the bamboo-staffed ascetic, is a
trap for humans, it seems to me. He has arisen in the world for the
harm, suffering, calamity, and disaster of many beings.”

###### 320

“Mendicants, the one who encourages someone in a poorly ex- 1.1
plained teaching and training, the one who they encourage, and the
one who practices accordingly all create much wickedness. Why is
that? Because the teaching is poorly explained.”

###### 321

“Mendicants, the one who encourages someone in a well explained 1.1
teaching and training, the one who they encourage, and the one
who practices accordingly all create much merit. Why is that?
Because the teaching is well explained.”
###### 322

1.1 “Mendicants, in a poorly explained teaching and training, the donor
should know moderation, not the recipient. Why is that? Because
the teaching is poorly explained.”

###### 323

1.1 “Mendicants, in a well explained teaching and training, the recipient
should know moderation, not the donor. Why is that? Because
the teaching is well explained.”

###### 324

1.1 “Mendicants, in a poorly explained teaching and training an energetic person lives in suffering. Why is that? Because the teaching
is poorly explained.”

###### 325

1.1 “Mendicants, in a well explained teaching and training a lazy person lives in suffering. Why is that? Because the teaching is well
explained.”

###### 326

1.1 “Mendicants, in a poorly explained teaching and training a lazy
person lives happily. Why is that? Because the teaching is poorly
explained.”

###### 327

1.1 “Mendicants, in a well explained teaching and training an energetic
person lives happily. Why is that? Because the teaching is well
explained.”
###### 328

“Just as, mendicants, even a tiny bit of fecal matter still stinks, so too 1.1
I don’t approve of even a tiny bit of continued existence, not even
as long as a finger-snap.”

###### 329–332

“Just as even a tiny bit of urine, or spit, or pus, or blood still stinks, 1.1
so too I don’t approve of even a tiny bit of continued existence, not
even as long as a finger-snap.”
