"Bhikkhus, it is for these two reasons that the Tathāgata has prescribed the training rules for his disciples. What two? For the well-being of the Sangha and for the ease of the Sangha...For keeping recalcitrant persons in check and so that well-behaved bhikkhus can dwell at ease...For the restraint of taints pertaining to this present life, and for the dispelling of taints pertaining to future lives... For the restraint of enmities pertaining to this present life and for the dispelling of enmities pertaining to future lives...For the restraint of faults pertaining to this present life and for the dispelling of faults pertaining to future lives...For the restraint of perils pertaining to this present life and for the dispelling of perils pertaining to future lives... For the restraint of unwholesome qualities pertaining to this present life and for the dispelling of unwholesome qualities pertaining to future
lives...Out of compassion for laypeople and to stop the faction of those with evil desires...So that those without confidence might gain confidence and for increasing [the confidence] of those with confidence... For the continuation of the good Dhamma and for promoting the discipline. It is for these two reasons that the Tathāgata has prescribed the training rules for his disciples."
