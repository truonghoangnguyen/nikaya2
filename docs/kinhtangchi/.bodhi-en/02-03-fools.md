"Bhikkhus, these two things pertain to true knowledge. [^249] What two? Serenity and insight. When serenity is developed, what benefit does one experience? The mind is developed.

When wisdom is developed, what benefit does one experience? Ignorance is abandoned. [^250]

fading away of lust there is liberation of mind, and through the fading away of ignorance there is liberation by wisdom. [^251]
