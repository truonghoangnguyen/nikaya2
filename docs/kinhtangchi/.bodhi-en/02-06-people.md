"Bhikkhus, I will teach you about co-residency among the bad and about co-residency among the good. Listen and attend closely. I will speak."

"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:
"And how is there co-residency among the bad, and how do the bad live together? Here, it occurs to an elder bhikkhu: 'An elder [bhikkhu]-or one of middle standing or a junior [bhikkhu]-should not correct me. [^255] I should not correct an elder [bhikkhu], or one of middle standing or a junior [bhikkhu]. If an elder [bhikkhu] corrects me, he might do so without sympathy, not sympathetically. I would then say "No!" to him and would trouble him, [^256] and even seeing [my offense] I would not make amends for it. If [a bhikkhu] of middle standing corrects me... If a junior [bhikkhu] corrects me, he might do so without sympathy, not sympathetically. I would then say "No!" to him and would trouble him, and even seeing [my offense] I would not make amends for it.'

"It occurs, too, to [a bhikkhu] of middle standing ... to a junior [bhikkhu]: 'An elder [bhikkhu]-or one of middle standing or a junior [bhikkhu]-should not correct me. I should not correct an elder [bhikkhu] ...[79] ... and even seeing [my offense] I would not make amends for it.' It is in this way that there is co-residency among the bad, and it is in this way that the bad live together.

"And how, bhikkhus, is there co-residency among the good, and how do the good live together? Here, it occurs to an elder bhikkhu: 'An elder [bhikkhu]-and one of middle standing and a junior [bhikkhu]-should correct me. I should correct an elder [bhikkhu], one of middle standing, and a junior [bhikkhu]. If an elder [bhikkhu] corrects me, he might do so sympathetically, not without sympathy. I would then say "Good!" to him and would not trouble him, and seeing [my offense]. I would make amends for it. If [a bhikkhu] of middle standing speaks to me... If a junior [bhikkhu] corrects me, he might do so sympathetically, not without sympathy, I would then say "Good!" to him and would not trouble him, and seeing [my offense] I would make amends for it.'

"It occurs, too, to [a bhikkhu] of middle standing ... to a junior [bhikkhu]: 'An elder [bhikkhu]-and one of middle standing and a junior [bhikkhu]-should correct me. I should correct an elder [bhikkhu] ... and seeing [my offense] I would make amends for it.' It is in this way that there is co-residency among the good, and it is in this way that the good live together."

"Bhikkhus, when, in regard to a disciplinary issue, the exchange of words between both parties, [^297] the insolence about views, and the resentment, bitterness, and exasperation [80] are not settled internally, [^298] it can be expected that this disciplinary issue will lead to acrimony and animosity for a long time, and the bhikkhus will not dwell at ease.

"Bhikkhus, when, in regard to a disciplinary issue, the exchange of words between both parties, the insolence about views, and the resentment, bitterness, and exasperation are well settled internally, it can be expected that this disciplinary issue will not lead to acrimony and animosity for a long time, and the bhikkhius will dwell at ease." [^299]
