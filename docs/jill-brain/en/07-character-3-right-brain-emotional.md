# CHARACTER 3 RIGHT BRAIN EMOTIONAL

In the previous chapter we learned that at the most fundamental level, our
emotional left-brain Character 2 determines our current level of safety by
bringing in information about the present moment and then comparing that
stimulation to threats from our past. Our right-brain Character 3, on the
other hand, assesses the threat in the present moment based completely on
the information it is processing in the here and now. As a result, our rightbrain Character 3 brings a crucial and unique skill to how we process
threats. Because our right-brain Character 3 perceives everything as
interconnected and in the flow of all that is, it provides us with the bigpicture bird’s eye view of danger, whether that threat relates to the people
around us or to our environment.

When it comes to assessing how safe we are in the presence of another
person, our right-brain Character 3 is a well-honed truth detector. It reads
body language, matches it with facial expression, and then interprets the
emotional cues of inflection of voice and vocal intonation. When all those
pieces of the puzzle fit together appropriately, we interpret that behavior as
truth. When the pieces do not fit together as they should—for example, if a
person’s body stance does not communicate openness when they are
professing their love—we question the overall integrity of what they are
saying.

Some people, for whatever reason, have mastered the fine art of
deception, and they do this by consciously manipulating how they are
perceived. They fly under other people’s right-brain radar. It is possible for
us to train ourselves to do this, but to be a really good liar, our left brain has
to recruit our right brain to help pull off the trickery. Our right brain would
be responsible for holding our body just right and not giving the deception
away with our mouth or eyes while manifesting appropriate vocal cues. If
for some reason our right brain chooses to not be in cahoots with our left
brain’s desire to deceive, expect to be caught and pay the consequences.

Our right-brain Character 3 interprets our overall level of safety in our
immediate environment based upon how much of what we are experiencing
feels familiar. Our right brain is constantly evaluating the bigger picture of
where we are, and it is ever assessing—albeit perhaps silently in the
background of our awareness—an escape route in the event that we should
be cornered. However, it is not unusual for our left-brain Character 1 to step
in and override these right-brain self-preserving sensitivities. Although our
right brain might alert us to a danger, if we choose to listen to the louder
rationalizing voice of our left-brain Character 1 instead, we may
unwittingly step into trouble. A fabulous book on this subject is _The Gift of_
_Fear_ by Gavin de Becker.



### **BOUNDLESS AND PRESENT**

From a perceptual perspective, when the stroke wiped out the cells of my
left brain, my whole world went topsy-turvy. Without those left-brain skills
opposing my right-brain experience, I could no longer define the boundaries
of where I began and where I ended. Because there was no separation
between the atoms and molecules that made up me and those making up
everything around me, I no longer perceived myself to be an individual. As
a result of this blending, I perceived myself to be a fluid rather than a solid,
existing in a constant state of motion and change. Without boundaries, I was
exactly that: boundless. So I perceived myself to be both free flowing and
as big as the universe.

Think about what that might mean for you. Although you will always
have the taming force of your left-brain Characters 1 and 2, this right-brain
part of you is always there, too, and always turned on. It is a fine art for us
to devolve our focus away from the past or future to attend to the
sensibilities of the present moment. When we do this, the details of our life
fade away and our experience of the present moment expands.

When my left brain went off-line, I lost all words and language, including
the mental file that held all the details of my life. Consequently, I had no
identity and knew nothing about myself. Although the consciousness of me
still existed inside this same body, the person I had been before, her likes
and dislikes, no longer existed. Yet even in the absence of my left-brain
ego-self, I remained a conscious and living being. I simply could no longer
communicate with words. They had become mere sounds that had no
meaning. This experience was the first step in my Hero’s Journey, when I
laid down the sword of my ego—my individuality—and stepped into the
realm of my unconscious right brain.

Have you ever been so scared, excited, or dumbfounded that you could
not speak, or time seemed to slow down? Have you ever awakened in a
strange place and momentarily forgotten where you were? During such
moments we are fully conscious and aware, but there is a brief disconnect
from our left brain, with all of its background and reality-based information.

Sometimes we are thrust into the right here, right now not by our choosing.
At other times we arrive in the present moment by choice.

All we have to do to bring our mind to the present moment is to push the
pause button on whatever it is that we are doing, thinking, or feeling and
consciously bring our attention to our immediate sensory experience of
textures, sights, and smells. This is easy when we are willing to step away
from the details of our lives and shift our focus to what life _feels_ like. Not
how we feel emotionally but how we feel _experientially_ . You know how it
feels when the sun is kissing your face with its warmth, or you tune in to the
vibration of the jet passing overhead. That is the kind of feeling I tune in to
when I am in my Character 3. It is not so much my emotions I am in touch
with, as those are more the realm of my left-brain Character 2. My
Character 3 is sensually experiential whether I am swimming in the
thickness of water or swinging at a tennis ball with an expanded focus on
all that is.

I know I am in my right brain when I am feeling a sense of gratitude for
anything at all, be it my life, my circumstances, or the friendship of another.
Joy, however, is the underlying feeling of our right-brain Character 3, so if
you want to shift quickly into your Character 3, get experiential: do
something fun and engage your sense of humor. And the messier it is, the
better! Anytime we laugh out loud, we can’t help but be open, present, and
completely vulnerable, which is why it feels so great and is so good for us.

After my stroke, because I had lost all perception of time, I existed in the
eternal timelessness of the present moment. To my mind, the linearity of
time was no longer measured in the man-made intervals of seconds,
minutes, and hours. Instead, time passed in moments: some brief, some
longer, all depending on what I was doing. Playing or creating in the
absence of my left brain’s judgment was both meaningful and satisfying.

Without any awareness of my physical boundaries, it was impossible for
me to distinguish other people as entities that were separate from me. As a
result, I perceived us all collectively and energetically as a part of the same
being. It was as though we were all woven together into a fabric of tiny
molecules that were in motion, and together we made up a tapestry of
humanity. We didn’t need to communicate with words because we
empathically felt one another’s feelings, and we communicated through
facial expressions and body language. We were all in the flow together, as a
single unit that was made up of the sum of our parts.

This is comparable to what happens when we get caught up in the right
here, right now excitement of a ball game. We shift into our Character 3s as
a group while we sit together on the edge of our seats, being blown away by
those incredible plays or those jaw-dropping volleys. Our consciousness
collectively expands, and as a whole we leap to our feet, high-five, scream
with elation, and maybe even do the “wave” as a fused group. Caught up in
the moment, this is not about me and it is not about you. It is about all of us
as one team, and our energy has the potency to bust the roof off the
stadium. How fantastic it is when we are here together, sharing these
amazing moments. Lost in the flow of the excitement, we are each a part of
the whole, all dressed in the same colors. _Gosh, that game flew right by. I_
_can’t believe how late it is. I am so hungry._ This is time well spent in our
right-brain Character 3s.

Sometimes I think about how a culture of bacteria that is made up of a
bunch of individual cells has the ability to collectively share enough of a
communal awareness that they can work together to infect and overtake a
host. Even though each of those cells is an individual, they work in
synchrony to become a powerful predator against a body that is billions of
times their size. This is comparable to the trillions of cells that make up
your body, with each cell an individual with its own position, shape, and
job. And somehow, all of those cells work independently to do their part
and then collectively they communicate with one another, making up a
healthy you.

This is how we humans, as a species, exist and function when we are in
the consciousness of our right brains. We are all equally important brothers
and sisters who are united as one human family. Our uniqueness contributes
to the betterment and increased variability and viability of the whole. I
believe that our right-brain emotional Character 3 is the same part of
ourselves as Carl Jung’s archetype the Anima/Animus, which represents the
inner femininity of males and the inner masculinity of females. According
to Jung, all humans are energetically androgynous, and this part of
ourselves serves as the primary source of communication with the
collective consciousness of our species, independent of our gender. When
we are all joining in a high five, it does not matter what gender we are.

When it comes to the magnificence of humanity, our right brains are clear
that our differences contribute to our creativity and versatility. But
unfortunately our left brain’s tendency toward negative judgment toward

others who are different from us sets us up for separatism, racism, and
bigotry. The truth is that our strength is in our differences, not in our
similarities. If you were stranded on a desert island, would you want
another person just like you around or someone who had different interests
and a different set of skills? If I were stranded on a desert island, I would
welcome your differences, and my left brain would immediately drop its
tendency toward superiority and negative judgment, or else you might just
toss me off the island or make me fend for myself.



### **EMOTION, PAST AND PRESENT**

As we discussed at length in the previous chapter, the fundamental
anatomical difference between our left-brain emotional Character 2 and our
right-brain emotional Character 3 is how these two emotional groups of
cells process the information they receive from those reptilian brain stem
cells. Briefly, our left-brain Character 2 amygdala will immediately
compare incoming information about the present moment with memories
from our past. As soon as this happens, the consciousness of our left-brain
emotional Character 2 shifts out of the present moment and linearly
processes incoming stimulation about the external world. As a result, if I
am to feel remorse or guilt, or hold a grudge, I feel these emotions in the
present moment but they are about something that happened in the past. It is
the circuitry of my left-brain emotional Character 2 that has the ability to
experience dozens of specific emotions, both positive and negative, but they
are relative to past and future experiences.

Simultaneously, our Character 3 is the consciousness that has evolved in
our right-brain emotional tissue, which experiences emotions in the right
here, right now about this present moment. Because our Character 3 has no
perception about the past, and it never disconnects from the consciousness
of the present moment, it always exists at the level of the flow of the
universe. Call this the consciousness of the One, God, Allah, the power of
the present moment, Nature, the Universe, whatever suits your belief
system. Our right-brain consciousness is the realm of that unconscious
dimension that is ever flowing in the background of our left-brain focus on
the external world.

What this means is that when we feel that we are alone, it is because our
left brain perceives, feels, and experiences us to be alone. But when we
release our attachments to people and things in our external reality, we shift
back into the consciousness of the flow, whereby we can experience
gratitude and joy. At any moment we have the ability to choose which
consciousness we want to focus on: our left-brain external reality or our
right-brain present moment. It is one or the other at any moment in time.

We are either focused on our individuality or we allow ourselves to blend
into the flow.

In many instances when I am in my right-brain emotional Character 3, it
is difficult if not impossible for me to use words to describe exactly what I
am feeling, because it is impossible, by definition, to use words to describe
that which is not describable. For example, when we view art or hear music,
our right brain may be moved as we feel that something is beautiful. Our
whole soul might be wrapped up by the awe of our existence during a
sunset. Or when we stand at the top of a mountain, we can simultaneously
feel that we are both as big as the universe and as irrelevant as a speck of
dust. These are the moments in our collective consciousness that we can
neither measure nor define, yet we share an underlying knowing of what
they _feel_ like deep inside. It is our Character 3 that feels that magical
connection when we feel _home_ in a hug.

Creatively, if you are a natural musician or visual artist, you use your
right brain to express yourself. When our Character 3 comes out and is
dominant, we become uninhibited by the paralyzing fear of our left-brain
judgment. It is right here in the present moment when we find a beat, add a
rhythm, pick out a melody, and hook up with our left-brain lyric-writing
self to communicate a message that is a perfect combination of story,
emotion, and feeling. But when we work it, study it, and perfect it, our left
brain is the master of practice, and then our right brain makes magic happen
during the performance.

Many of us compulsively express ourselves artistically, and few things
are more beautiful than the feeling we get when we are completely lost in
the flow. Some people proclaim that their creative process is an agonizingly
painful experience that is, in its own weird way, uniquely delicious. Others
just link up to their muse and genius pours right through. I know that when
I carve stone, I become so caught up in the flow that I feel compelled to
discover and release whatever figure is stuck inside the block. How lovely it
is that we humans have this capacity through our right brains to reach deep
inside and express ourselves in creative ways. What a bonus it is if our
creation somehow touches the heart (or right brain) of another.

This alternate reality of our right brain whereby everything is related is
an actual consciousness. But because we cannot define it, see it, touch it,
smell it, taste it, or hear it, this parallel world of perception is often
minimized, invalidated, and denied by our left-brain counterpart, which

only believes in the external world. It is in this realm of the right-brain
energetic flow where synchronicities commonly unfold. Yet in the _real_
world, for a strong left brain, those synchronicities are easily dismissed as
mere coincidences.

This is a fair judgment from our left brain if we consider how threatening
this idea of connection might be to the individuality of our left-brain egocenter. The only problem with denying the duality of our left and right
brains, and the realms they independently navigate, is the billions of things
in our right-brain world that defy our left brain’s definition of truth. Even
the existence of life itself is unexplainable by our left brain. It is so
important to realize that simply because our left brain has an opinion about
something, that does not make it true.

When infants are born, their brains have not yet had a chance to define
the boundaries of where they begin and end. Consequently, the
consciousness of our right brain is dominant at birth and until we have
acquired enough information about ourselves and the world around us to
establish ourselves as individuals who are separate from the flow. Kids tend
to exude their right-brain Character 3s onto the playground with full force
until their left brain develops a _reality-based_ consciousness, at which point
they begin to mature both scholastically and physically. Schools promote
our left-brain development, especially with the introduction of reading,
writing, and math. Add to that classes like geography and history, which
require our left brain to mature so we can memorize a bazillion details. My
little right-brain Character 3 never understood why I had to stuff all those
dates and details inside my head. Wasn’t it enough that I knew where to find
them?

When I was around eight years old, I asked my mom if she thought in
words or pictures. She told me she thought in language. Thinking in words
was a profound concept for me because my brain flashed videos, not letters.
Later as adults, G. G. and I vacationed together and shared trashy novels. I
would ask her what the book was about and she would give me a
rudimentary plot. It turned out that her brain actually read words, just
words, while my brain read words and then created a video of the story.
One of my favorite books on this subject is _Thinking in Pictures_ by Temple
Grandin.

When kids play together, they hang with others who have shared
interests: “Kickball, anyone?” Our Character 3 will swing on that swing

higher and higher, as high as it can get, and it is in those wondrous
moments of soaring with the birds that no one is thinking about that spelling
test tomorrow. Whatever our age, our Character 3 is the part of our brain
that loves doing stuff in our body and being active. It is also the big-kid part
of our brain that never grows up, loves to walk in the rain, and catches the
ESPN sports recap of the day for all of those spectacular plays.



### **CHARACTER 3 IN THE WORLD**

Our right-brain emotional Character 3 is like a puppy that is always
watching every move you make, ready to pounce the moment you reach for
the leash, toy, or food bowl. Our Character 3 is the virtuoso who is eager to
practice for hours and hours on end at whatever brings it joy and thrills its
soul. This part of our brain sees possibilities instead of limitations.
Everything is about the connection with myself or with others, and as I
practice, practice, practice, I am constantly tweaking and correcting until it
_feels_ right. What can I do in this moment to strengthen my stride or deepen
my breath so I can get a better outcome?

Our Character 3s are witty and hilarious. We will laugh so hard that we
stomp the ground as we gasp for more air. Wide open emotionally and in
the present moment, we become a pack and feel camaraderie with everyone
who is joining in. When we get excited together, we share a deep
connection, and these become the moments we cherish, talk about, and later
embellish. We thrive as a collective, connected by our similarities and
overlooking our differences.

Although our Character 3 is a whole lot of wonderful, it also has the
potential to get us into serious trouble. It is Character 3’s nature to act
impulsively in the present moment without considering the consequences of
our behavior. “What were you thinking?” Well, clearly, I was not thinking. I
was feeling, as I was having an experience in the present moment and it
seemed like a good idea at the time. Unless I am a teenager whose brain has
not yet completely developed (and that is a whole different book), suffice it
to say that it is the nature of Character 3 to push limits, buck authority, and
ask for forgiveness rather than permission, regardless of age.

Our Character 3 is often not interested in conceding to the authority of
our Character 1, even though our Character 1 may be very interested in
controlling what our Character 3 is up to. I spend a lot of time on a lake,
and when the storm clouds roll in, my Character 1 knows very well that it is
time for me to head off the water. My Character 3, however, has a mind of
her own. She figures those clouds _might_ mean a big storm, but they also
might pass by me. So until I see lightning, I’ll keep hoe-dee-doing this way,
and I’ll head for cover if the rain begins. I hate to admit it, but only in the
last few months have I been willing to let my Character 1 take charge of
these sorts of safety decisions. I have been really glad about this several times in just the last few months, and I have to say, _Go Helen_ .

Character 3s are quite compulsive and like to do things their own way,
and when they have a vision of what they want to accomplish, it is hard to
give them any input or suggestions. My Character 3 has adopted the
mindset that if you want to get something done quickly, it is easier to just
do it yourself than to try to find the right words to tell someone else how
you want it done. Character 1s are much better at using their words, as they
are methodical and have a pronounced mastery of language. Character 3s,
on the other hand, just dive in and go-go-go. Act first and explore the
possibilities, and then step back and hope it all went well. The last time I
cooked eggs, I was in the mood for some sweet potatoes too. Instead of
asking my friend who is a good cook for suggestions, I just dove right in
and failed miserably. Sadly, the worst thing you can do when I am in that
frame of mind is to try to help me. Mark Twain had it right when he said
something about how there are things you can learn by carrying a cat by the
tail that you can learn no other way. That would be our Character 3.



### **CHARACTER 3 AT WORK AND AT PLAY**

**Character 3 on the Job**

Our Character 3 is happy when people are together, so regardless of
whether they are a leader or a worker, Character 3s enjoy meeting with
people face-to-face so they can _do_ things. Character 3s love group projects,
but they also work well alone. They pivot easily between different parts of
the project and rarely choose to start at the beginning or work linearly.
Character 3s thrive on creative projects that are not well defined, and they
look for reasons to use space and collaborate.

Character 3s shy away from giving a boss a timeline for when they will
be finished with a project because they get all caught up in the doing of the
task, and that pesky clock only interrupts the flow of the creative
performance. Character 3s will get the job done and probably create
something magical, but they prefer to not be held accountable to a deadline.
The worst thing any boss can do to a Character 3 is to ask them to set a
plan, a schedule, a deadline, and a budget. And of course, Lord help your
board meeting if you ever give a Character 3 a whiteboard and a palette of
colorful markers or put them in charge of running the agenda.
### **Character 3 at the Beach**

Character 3s are so excited to get to the beach that they forgot to bring
the sunscreen. The towel is tossed in a crumpled wad in the sand, but that is
okay because they will dry off in the sun. Dressed in a comfy, colorful
Hawaiian shirt and shorts with a cap that doesn’t match, they dash along the
edge of the water squealing like little pigs because it is a bit nippy and they
are so happy to be there. Just look at the way the sun dances through the
rippled surface, making a bright, shiny neural network on the ocean floor. It
is so beautiful!

Character 3s didn’t plan much for this adventure because their
anticipation of what fun they would have was so exciting they couldn’t
focus on anything else. They grabbed whatever they could find to wear, and
right here, right now they are busting out their best dance moves and
laughing together in total joy. It is such a thrill to see people they already
know, and to connect with new friends who have familiar interests and
energy. They focus on what they have in common and what they like about
one another. Mostly they are grateful they are all here together.

To the Character 3 the mess is an integral part of the beach experience.
They relish the sandy beachfront as the perfect playground because they are
sensual beings and this environment is so rich with the grit, the sun, and the
wind. Character 3s are out socializing and saying hello, not just to the
people but to the birds and crabs and all those little creatures that scurry.
They wear a smile and offer an open invitation for all other Character 3s to
join in as they build a sandcastle or bury a pal. In groups, Character 3s play
games and make up new ones. They pay the locals to braid cornrows into
their hair and then leave them in way longer than they should.

Character 3s celebrate all that the beach has to offer without comparing it
to the last time they were there. They pick a sunscreen based on the way it
smells or how cool its label is rather than its brand. And rest assured they
will probably get sunburned anyway because they will forget to reapply it,
if they bother to put it on at all. Oh yes, all that rotting seaweed and those
smelly fish over there—what a great place to explore. And those tiny little
holes that bubble when the tide recedes, are there creatures in there? Let’s
dig and see.

The perfect day at the beach for a Character 3 is any day they see a
dolphin at play, and they’ll hunt for shark’s teeth and give them all away.
Come sun or come rain, any sensual time in nature without a schedule is an
awesome day. Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, that was the BEST time ever. Can
we do it again tomorrow?

### **Getting to Know Your Character 3**

If you prefer to skip these questions for now and continue
reading, please feel free to do so. Focusing on these different parts
of your brain can be taxing, so approaching them when you are
feeling patient and refreshed might be a good idea.

If you’re ready now, let’s explore your right-brain emotional
Character 3.

**1. Do you recognize your Character 3? Pause for a moment and**
**imagine yourself being in this present-moment character. Let**
**your left brain drift into the background as you bring your**
**attention to the right here, right now and explore the immediate**
**sounds, textures, sights, and smells. How easy is it for you to**
**make this shift?**

Character 3 is my primary character in that I wake up in the
morning as this part of myself and then consciously shift myself into
a different character as needed. I feel joy in my heart as soon as I
wake up, and I am curious about what is on my schedule for the day.
Then once I check out my scheduled commitments, I meander from
one thing to the next pretty much without a plan but problem
solving as I go. At least until Character 1 pops in and I am back on
the schedule again. My automatic impulse is to slip back into the
freedom of the present moment, unless there is some reason why I
should be a different character.

**2. What does Character 3 feel like inside of your body? Do you**
**feel your heart expand? Do you stand more on your tippy-toes**
**as though you are lighter? Does your voice disappear because**
**it’s not about output but just about bringing it all in? What does**

**your Character 3 feel like when you are having an experience**
**right here, right now?**

My Character 3 is a joyful little character who loves life and loves
you. It feels very alive inside of me and infiltrates every molecule of
my being. My Character 3 is light in my body, healthy, physically
strong, and athletically agile. This bright, effusive, uncomplicated,
uninhibited, often unruly, explosive part of me expresses herself
with reckless abandon.

**3. But what if you don’t recognize your right-brain emotional**
**Character 3?**

If you do not recognize your Character 3, you are missing out on
the expression of a whole lot of spontaneous energy that has no plan
and no timeline and has limitless curiosity. This expression of
ourself is the unbridled emotion of the present moment that might
manifest as an uncontrollable belly laugh—or an abrupt explosion of

anger.

Right here, right now our Character 3 supports a personality that
is exuberant, joyful, and completely devoted to the sensations and
experience of this moment, without fear or judgment. It does not
know about the past and has no perception of the future. As such, it
does not perceive risk as a negative thing but merely as a great
adventure and a yummy adrenaline rush. Our Character 3 is
emotionally connected to other people through empathy, likes
variation, and thrives on anything experiential.

As you might imagine, however, this uncontrolled, unpredictable
energy of an unbridled Character 3, which has little if any respect
for authority, would probably drive any self-respecting Character 1
bananas. In our society Character 1s are the voice of authority and
are often uncomfortable with the impulsive nature of our Character
3s. Consequently, if you do not recognize your Character 3, it may
have been driven into submission and quiet obedience when those
left-brain characters had little use for its happy-go-lucky, fun-loving,
high energy.

**4. Assuming you can identify your right-brain emotional**
**Character 3, do you like how this character expresses itself**
**inside of you? How much of the time do you let your Character**
**3 run your life, and under what circumstances?**

I am madly in love with the way my Character 3 feels inside of
me, and although I value all Four Characters, I spend most of my
time beaming Character 3 into the world. I express this part when I
am carving limestone or creating something wondrous out of stained
glass. I enthusiastically love to do all kinds of things, and whether it
is a dirty job and I am laboring and sweating or I am biking, rowing,
swimming, or hanging out with a kindred spirit, my Character 3
feels healthy and ebullient.

Whatever this part of me is up to, you can rest assured that I am
creatively scheming in the right here, right now and innovatively
participating with every ounce of my being. My Character 3 does
not hold back at all, and fortunately my Character 1 keeps an eye
out for her well-being when I am lost in the flow. I have learned that
a strong Character 3 who is supported by a strong Character 1 is a
really productive and beautiful collaboration.

**5. As you think about your Right Emotional Character 3, can**
**you assign it an appropriate name? In addition, now that you**
**are more familiar with your left-brain Characters 1 and 2, are**
**you satisfied with the names you assigned to them earlier?**

I have named my Character 3 “Pigpen.” Remember Charles
Schulz’s _Peanuts_ character who is always walking around in a dust
storm? My little right-brain emotional Character 3 is just like that.
She is here, she is there, she is everywhere, always in the present
moment stirring up some sort of a mess, with gusto. Not so much
out of control or embarking on illegalities but definitely out of
alignment with the more prudent values of my left brain.

Pigpen is totally open, emotionally available, and ingenious, and
in her innocence she is both vulnerable and naive. Because she
exists in the right here, right now, if my left brain is not informing

me intelligently, my Pigpen has the capacity to make some really
bad decisions based purely on ignorance.

I encourage you to reach deep inside for a very special and
appropriate name for your Character 3. What fits your joyful and
fun-loving nature?

**6. Who are some of the Character 3s who have influenced you**
**over the course of your life, in positive or negative ways? Was**
**your Character 3 emboldened by their Character 3 or repressed**
**by it?**

My dad, Hal, was a powerful Character 3, so I grew up with my
eyes wide open to the advantages and disadvantages of expressing
this character. Because Hal was incredibly creative, when I was a
child we always had the most phenomenal Halloween outfits you
ever saw. And talk about a music man: he could pick up any wind
instrument and within 20 minutes be taking song requests. The
downside of having Hal as a Character 3, as you might imagine, was
the burden this placed on my mother, G. G., to maintain order in the
house. As a result, our basement and garage were embarrassing
disaster zones and it was impossible to locate anything.

I learned that if I was going to let my Character 3 run wild when
in project mode, it was vital that my Character 1 come on board to
manage the mess and recreate order regularly. To this day I have a
very satisfying relationship between these two characters. If
Character 1 didn’t come along and do her thing, the total lack of
order would render my Character 3 paralyzed and unproductive.

**7. Who in your life appreciates, cares for, identifies with, and**
**wants to hang out with your Character 3? What are those**
**relationships like?**

I think most of my friends enjoy playing with Pigpen, and they
know exactly what they are signing up for when we get together.
When I think about my closest friends, we are a creative bunch.
Although Pigpen is extremely patient during projects and versatile

in how she likes to spend time, it takes a lot of effort for her to hold
the space for someone else’s Character 2 until that person is willing
to shift into their present-moment joy.

The fine art of matching someone else’s emotional needs is a
natural skill for Pigpen, as one of Character 3’s natural abilities is to
feel empathy. Pigpen’s aptitude for love and compassion is off the
charts, but there are times when my Character 1, Helen, wants to
jump right in and fix the problem, or my Character 4 (whom you
will meet in the next chapter) steps up to wrap herself around a
hurting soul.

Little Abby, my Character 2, also has the capacity to be a good
friend to someone else’s Character 2 because sometimes life simply
boils down to two Character 2s holding space for one another. That
famous quote “A friend in need is a friend indeed” speaks loudly to
all four of my characters. At the core of who I am, I believe our
number one job is to love one another.

**8. Who in your life does not get along with your Character 3?**

Anyone who is unhappy and committed to staying that way will
definitely find Pigpen irritating. Believe it or not, I had a boss who
told me once that I could not grow up to be a serious scientist
because I was too happy. Sadly, he was suffering emotionally
because he was in chronic physical pain. His Character 2 was his
daily dominant character, and often when our Character 2 is not
happy, we don’t want anyone around us to be happy either. A few
years later, when I won the Mysell Award in the Harvard
Department of Psychiatry, the most prestigious award that
department offers to an M.D. or Ph.D. for their research, I
reminisced about that negative assessment of my Character 3, and
my whole self felt vindicated.

Although my Character 1, Helen, was always in charge of getting
me to work on time, my lab-rat life was dominated by the playful
spirit of my Character 3. In fact, when I applied for the position in
the Harvard Department of Psychiatry, I told my future boss that I
was an artist in my heart but I had chosen science to make a living. I

essentially had told her that I had a strong Character 3 that was
creative, innovative, and exploratory, but I also had a strong
Character 1 that would do the job well and meet my deadlines. She
hired me immediately and was intuitive enough to assign me the
research projects that would benefit from an aesthetic eye. We had a
successful working relationship because we capitalized on our
individual strengths.

**9. What kind of parent, partner, or friend is your Character 3?**

Our Character 3s are a fantastic part of who we are, but since they
thrive on chaos, the creative process, and the present moment, they
may be the most fun and emotionally available parent but are
certainly not the most organized or disciplined. It’s also important to
note that if you are a parent and a primary Character 3, it is neither
fair nor appropriate for you to push a child into their Character 1
prematurely so they can bear the burden of creating order.

Children are biologically children and need to be protected as
such. A parent who has a drug or alcohol addiction cannot show up
as a healthy Character 1, so responsibilities often fall to the oldest
child, demanding they prematurely develop their Character 1 at an
early age. It is important that we pay attention to the demands we
are making on those around us, and this is one of the reasons why
this material is so important. Even if you are a primary Character 3,
you can train your Character 1 to come online when it is appropriate
for you to show up as a healthy adult.

Similarly, it is important that as adults we provide structure not
just for our young children but for our teenagers. The human brain
does not fully mature until around the age of 25, so although young
people may look like adults, until their brains reach maturity our
Character 1s need to help them out by providing structure and taking
on the role of Character 1 for them. Clearly some young children are
born with a penchant for order and perfectionism—in other words,
some children start out with some Character 1 skills —but for those
who are not born this way, we need to provide structure for them.

Although it is important that we befriend our children, it is more
important that we parent them.

If you are a Character 3 as a partner, hopefully there is a
Character 1 around, or your home may be in total chaos as a result
of hoarding. The human brain that has no order may be brilliant,
ingenious, creative, innovative, and all those magnificent traits of a
Character 3, but without some semblance of order we don’t have a
neuron to hang our ideas on and thus end up accomplishing very
little.

In the meantime, love those little Character 3s, and let them
remind you what it was like to be a kid. It will be good for your
heart, both physically and emotionally.

**10. Although we have not yet fully examined Character 4, it is**
**important to consider how kind the relationship between your**
**characters inside your head is. How does your Character 3**
**relate to your other characters?**

As I have expressed, my Character 3, Pigpen, appreciates my
Character 1, Helen, and is completely cooperative with her because
she knows that Helen is eager and willing to take care of all the
things Pigpen has no interest spending time on. Although Pigpen is
really bright, resilient, and creative, she is not an intellectual, thus
she finds memorizing details and reading manuals painfully tedious.
Thank goodness Helen is here to run our world so Pigpen can get
lost in the flow of whatever has most recently caught her fancy.
Pigpen has been known to rebel against a schedule, and she does not
like to be controlled by others, but when she feels accepted and
valued for her natural skills, Pigpen is a loyal, faithful, and
committed friend to everyone, especially my other characters.

My Character 3, Pigpen, and Character 2, Abby, also have a really
important relationship. When Abby brings a sense of fear or
unhappy discontentment into the present moment, Pigpen has
mastered the skill of helping Abby find her way out of the pain and
into the play. And when Abby is caught in the grip of her deepest
inner grief or sadness, Pigpen does not shy away from her pain.

Instead Pigpen is a really good friend. She will not only hold the
space and comfort Abby but will remind her how blessed they are to
be alive, and how important it is that they celebrate this capacity to
feel the depth and deliciousness of that misery.
