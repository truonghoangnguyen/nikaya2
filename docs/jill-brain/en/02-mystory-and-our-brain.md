# MYSTORY AND OUR BRAIN

I grew up to study the brain because I had a brother 18 months older than
I who would eventually be diagnosed with the brain disorder schizophrenia.
As young siblings, my brother and I were virtually inseparable, but at an
early age, I realized that he and I were very different from one another in
how we experienced reality. On a routine basis, we would have the exact
same experience but walk away with very different interpretations of what
had just happened. He might think our mother was angry at us based on the
tone of her voice, for example, while I was quite sure she was petrified that
we were going to be hurt. Because of this I became fascinated with trying to
understand what was “normal” because it was clear to me that one of us
was atypical. As far as I could tell, he was oblivious to our different
perceptions and interpretations.

For my own survival and sanity, I started paying very close attention to
what I could learn from others based on their body and facial languages. I
became fascinated with anatomy, and at Indiana University I pursued
undergraduate degrees in physiological psychology and human biology.
After spending a couple of years as a lab tech in a neuroanatomy lab, I
skipped the master’s degree program and went straight for a Ph.D. in life
sciences at Indiana State University.

Although my research focus was in neuroanatomy through the Indiana
University School of Medicine, I found my true joy in the gross anatomy
lab, where we dissected human cadavers. For me there is truly nothing more
magnificent than the human body, so “gross” lab was a spectacular treat. It
was during this doctoral program that my brother, at the age of 31, was
officially diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia. As you might imagine, a
part of me felt relieved to learn that he was the one diagnosed as “not
normal,” as that meant that I was most likely the neurotypical one.

After I received my doctorate in Indiana, I scooted off to Boston, where I
initially spent two years in the Harvard Department of Neuroscience. From
there, I spent four years in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry, working
with the amazing “Queen of Schizophrenia,” Dr. Francine Benes. My

research and professional life truly began to blossom. I adored being a lab
rat and felt an awe-inspired camaraderie with the beautiful cells I examined
through the microscope.

I was fascinated with how our brains create our perception of reality. I
studied the postmortem brain cells and circuitry of people who were
diagnosed as normal-control—meaning they would be used as the control
group in the experiments I was designing—and then compared that tissue
with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia,
schizoaffective, or bipolar disorder. My weekdays were spent performing
jaw-dropping innovative research, which ultimately resulted in journal
articles with titles like “Differential Distribution of Tyrosine Hydroxylase
Fibers on Small and Large Neurons in Layer II of Anterior Cingulate
Cortex of Schizophrenic Brain” and “Colocalization of Glutamate
Decarboxylase, Tyrosine Hydroxylase and Serotonin Immunoreactivity in
Rat Medial Prefrontal Cortex.” This last one became a classic, as it was the
first article ever to be published by the first online-only scientific journal,
_Neuroscience-Net_ .

On the weekends, with guitar in tow, I took a different tack. I traveled as
the “Singin’ Scientist” for the Harvard Brain Bank, educating families with
mental illness about the shortage of brain tissue for research and the value
of brain donation. At the age of 36, I found myself the youngest person to
ever be elected to the national board of directors of NAMI, the National
Alliance on Mental Illness. This wonderful organization has a membership
of over 100,000 families whose loved ones have been diagnosed with
severe mental illness. NAMI is a really important national, state, and local
[resource for families in need (NAMI.org). Between the research and](http://nami.org/)
advocating for the mentally ill at the national level, my life had terrific
purpose. I was helping people like my brother while at the same time
keeping my finger on the pulse of research and public policy.

I was in the prime of my life, strong and athletic, and climbing the
Harvard ladder. I was fulfilling my dreams as a successful neuroscientist in
the world of schizophrenia and finding meaning as a national-level
advocate. Then, on the morning of December 10, 1996, at the age of 37, I
woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye.



### **MY STROKE AND INSIGHT**

As it turned out, I was born with a congenital neurological brain disorder
that I didn’t know was there until it became a problem. An arteriovenous
malformation (AVM) exploded in the left hemisphere of my brain, and over
the course of four hours I watched my brain functions shut down one by
one. On the afternoon of the stroke I could not walk, talk, read, write, or
recall any of my life. In effect, I had become an infant in a woman’s body.

As you might imagine, it was fascinating for me to watch my brain
systematically break down, through the eyes of a neuroscientist. The
damage to the left hemisphere of my brain was so traumatic that I
predictably lost the ability to speak and understand language. In addition,
the chattering “monkey mind” of my left brain went silent. With that
internal dialogue circuitry shut off, I sat in the center of a completely silent
brain for five full weeks. I even lost that little voice of my left-brain egoself that could say, “I am an individual, separate from the whole. I am Dr.
Jill Bolte Taylor.” In the absence of my chatty and linear-thinking left brain,
I stepped into the awe-inspiring experiential sensations of the present
moment, and it was beautiful there.

Compounding my deficiencies of language and individuality, the injury
to my left parietal lobe, which processes sensory information from the
outside world, made it impossible for me to identify the boundaries of
where my physical body began and where it ended. As a result my
perception of myself became altered. Instead of a physical being, I
experienced myself to be an energy ball that was as big as the universe.
Shifted into this consciousness of my right brain, I perceived the essence of
myself as enormous and expansive, and my spirit soared free, like a great
whale gliding through a sea of silent euphoria.

Emotionally I went from feeling the normal emotions I had experienced
in my pre-stroke life to feeling nothing except a sense of peaceful bliss. I
know this sounds like an amazing blessing, and it certainly was, but being
able to feel a range of emotions makes life much more diverse and
interesting. Physically, within those same four hours on the morning of the
stroke, I went from being able to swim a mile in 30 minutes to lying

sprawled on a hospital gurney with my conscious mind trapped inside a
motionless body that felt like a ton of lead.

It was eight years before my body completely recovered and I could
slalom water-ski again. During that time I regained the emotional circuits of
resentment, guilt, and embarrassment, as well as all of the other more subtle
feelings and emotions that make life alluring. Our emotions, even the
negative ones, truly enrich our perception of experience and make life
nuanced and more remarkable. I wrote about this stroke, recovery, and
lessons learned about neuroplasticity and the ability of the brain to recover

.
in my memoir, _My Stroke of Insight: A Brain Scientist’s Personal Journey_

Since then I have begun to explore even more deeply the most valuable
insight I gained from this sojourn into the depths of my brain: the
realization that we have the power to turn our emotional circuitry on and off
by choice. In fact, the same principle underlying our bodies’ neurological
reflexes, like the kick our knee will give when our patella tendon is tapped
with a reflex hammer, remains in play when an emotional circuit is
triggered and we reflexively respond with fear, anger, or hostility.

Once the circuit is stimulated and we have triggered an emotional
response, it takes less than 90 seconds for the chemistry of that emotion to
flood through us and then flush completely out of our bloodstream. Of
course, we can either consciously or unconsciously choose to rethink the
thought that triggered the emotional circuit to run and stay hurt, angry, sad,
or whatever for longer than 90 seconds. But in that case what we are doing
at a neurological level is restimulating the emotional circuit so it will run
over and over again. If there is no repeated trigger, the emotional circuit
will run its course and stop after the 90 seconds that it takes for the
chemistry to neutralize. I call this the 90 Second Rule and will share
examples in the chapters ahead.



### **THE “WE” INSIDE OF ME**

The TED conference where I presented was dedicated to “The Big
Questions,” and for the opening session we speakers were directed to
address the theme “Who Are We?” I chose to approach this by talking about
the “We” inside each of our brains, the “We” of our left and right brain
hemispheres. The roster of speakers included some world-famous scientists,
including the Canadian anthropologist Wade Davis and Louise Leakey, a
National Geographic paleontologist. Then there was me, a Harvard-trained
girl from Indiana who had survived, and recovered from, a massive stroke.
Needless to say, I was the least known speaker in the lineup.

On the day before the opening of the conference, I was onstage giving a
practice run for the TED staff and crew. They were performing sound and
lighting checks and working through logistics, and because I had brought
along a preserved human brain, there were some special considerations.
After delivering the first six minutes of my presentation during that practice
run, I paused and was ready to stop, but Chris Anderson, the curator of
TED, encouraged me to proceed. His mother had experienced a stroke, so
he was particularly interested in my topic.

For the next segment, I took the audience on a reenacted journey into the
moment-by-moment breakdown of my mind as it had occurred on the
morning of the stroke. I shared what it felt like to waffle between the
consciousnesses of my left and right hemispheres. It was a dramatic
performance in which my left hemisphere was desperate to orchestrate my
rescue, countered by the blissful euphoria of my right hemisphere.

I described how I struggled to stay connected to my functional left brain
and managed to make a phone call for help, even though I had no
recognizable language. When I found myself curled up in a fetal ball in an
ambulance, I felt my spirit surrender, and in that release I was certain I was
in my moment of transition. At that point in the presentation, to my
surprise, an uncanny silence fell over the TED practice room, and I realized
that the staff and crew had stopped what they were doing to listen.

Quote: “When I awoke later that afternoon, I was shocked to discover
that I was still alive. When I felt my spirit surrender, I had said goodbye to

my life. Then I realized, but I’m still alive, and I have found Nirvana, and if
I have found Nirvana and I’m still alive, then everyone who is alive can
find Nirvana. I pictured a world filled with beautiful, peaceful,
compassionate, loving people who knew that they could purposely choose
to step to the right of their left hemispheres and find this peace. And then I
realized what a tremendous gift this experience could be, what a stroke of
insight this could be for how we live our lives. And it motivated me to
recover.”

The room was not silent anymore. When I finished, I heard sniffles and
even weeping. Chris immediately rearranged the schedule, shifting my talk
to the last spot of the afternoon. I might be an unknown girl from Indiana,
but he knew that this presentation was something special and that his
attendees would probably be profoundly moved. It turned out he was right.

Thanks to the response of the staff and crew, I slept well that night and
woke up fresh before taking the TED center stage. I ended my talk in this
way, answering the “big question” with this reminder:
### **Who Are We?**

_We are the life-force power of the universe with manual dexterity_
_and two cognitive minds. We have the power to choose, moment by_
_moment, who and how we want to be in the world._

_Right here, right now, I can step into the consciousness of my right_
_hemisphere, where we are, I am, the life-force power of the universe. I_
_am the life-force power of the 50 trillion beautiful molecular geniuses_
_that make up my form, at One with all that is._

_Or, I can choose to step into the consciousness of my left_
_hemisphere, where I become a single individual, a solid, separate from_
_the flow, and separate from you. I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor: intellectual,_
_neuroanatomist._

_These are the “We” inside of me._
_Which would you choose? Which do you choose . . . and when?_
_I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner_
_peace circuitry of our right hemisphere, the more peace we will project_
_into the world and the more peaceful our planet will be._

_And I thought that was an idea worth spreading._



### **WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU**

As I have already mentioned, the public’s response to that TED talk
continues to be profound. It is clear that we, as a collective, are searching
for a specific set of directions about how we can choose the peaceful
mindset of our right hemisphere to counterbalance the chaos in our world.
Many of us are in search of a paradigm shift for how we can embrace our
deep inner peace, regardless of our situation.

The most frequently asked question I receive is “How do I quiet the brain
chatter in my left brain?” Clearly, many people want to stop their habits of
self-judgment and criticism. It is also common for me to hear “I have been
practicing meditation for years and have only experienced that feeling of
euphoria that you describe a couple of times. What can I do differently to
get there? Do you meditate, and if so, what form? Can you still find that
sense of euphoria, and if so, what can I do to get there?” Then there is this
one: “What drugs might I take to help me feel that euphoria you got from
the stroke? Psychedelics? If so, which ones?” (As important as that question
is, especially in light of the recent research into the use of ecstasy for posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], that field is beyond my knowledge base.)

By choosing to meditate, pray, or practice mindfulness exercises, we can
certainly quiet the chatter and free ourselves from the prison of our own
minds. But please be clear: This book is not about any of those subjects. It
is about “the power of the We inside of me.” I believe that the better we
understand the various groups of cells inside of our brain, how they are
organized, and what it feels like to run each of those different cellular
circuits, the more power we have to purposefully choose which of those
neural networks we want to run. By doing so we ultimately gain the power
to choose who and how we want to be in the world each and every moment,
regardless of what external circumstances we find ourselves in.

I will draw on two different disciplines to explain this idea in the chapters
ahead. The science of neuroanatomy involves the study of the structure of
the brain. The science of psychology involves the study of the mind and our
mental processes. What makes this book so unique and exciting is that the
psychology I present here is specifically correlated to the underlying brain

anatomy and what we know about the function of those specific groups of
cells. When you open yourself to this material, you will gain amazing
insights into both the conscious and unconscious realms of your left and
right hemispheres. By doing so you will become much more aware of your
power to choose who and how you want to be, because you will know what
your options are at both a psychological and biological level.

This journey we will take into your brain is reminiscent of Joseph
Campbell’s classic monomyth that describes the steps a hero must take to
fulfill his Hero’s Journey. In the language of the brain, the hero must step
out of his own ego-based left-brain consciousness into the realm of his right
brain’s unconsciousness. At this point the hero feels connected to all that is,
and is enveloped by a sense of deep inner peace. As you gain mastery of the
Four Characters in your brain, whom you are about to meet, you will
embark upon your own Hero’s Journey into the circuitry of your
unconscious brain and realize that peace really is just a thought away. It is
always right there and always available for you to embody.

When the cells in my left hemisphere experienced trauma and shut down,
I did not just lose cells and skill sets. I lost parts of my personality,
including the highly motivated part that was smart, disciplined, punctual,
detail based, methodical, and well organized and that knew the details of
my life. That part of me was a character that disappeared with the stroke
and was no longer available, at least until those cells recovered and that
circuitry came back online. I also lost the part of my personality that had
known all of the challenges, emotions, and pain from my past. Without that
character available, all I could experience was the peaceful euphoria of the
present moment.

It took eight years for me to rebuild all of those wounded circuits, and
then resurrect and recover those two left-brain characters that had gone offline. I learned the hard way that we each have four distinctive groups of
cells, divided between our two brain hemispheres, that generate four
consistent and predictable personalities. Neuroanatomically these four
groups of cells make up the left and right _thinking_ centers of our higher
cerebral cortex, as well as our left and right _emotional_ centers of our lower
limbic system. Collectively, I call these personalities the Four Characters.
Getting to know them inside of your brain is a ticket to freedom.

I realize that the material in this book may require a theoretical shift in
how you think about your brain anatomy. For at least 50 years, we have

been trained as a society to believe that our left hemisphere is our “rational
thinking” brain, while our right hemisphere is our “emotional” brain.
Actually, from a neuroanatomical perspective, although it is true that our
left thinking tissue is the home of our conscious, rational mind (which I will
refer to as Character 1), both our left and right brain hemispheres share the
cells of our emotional limbic system equally (Characters 2 and 3).
Character 4 occupies the higher cortical thinking tissue of our right brain.



### **HOW WE THINK AND FEEL**

At any moment in time, there are pretty much only three things going on
in our brain. We think thoughts, we feel emotions, and we run physiological
responses to what we are thinking and feeling. Each of these activities is
completely dependent on the health and well-being of the cells that are
performing those functions.

We experience emotions via the cells of our limbic system, and these
cells are evenly divided between our two hemispheres. The major structures
of the limbic system are mirrored in each hemisphere such that we have two
amygdalae, two hippocampi, and two anterior cingulate gyri, among others.
This means we have two separate modules for emotional processing
(Characters 2 and 3). When information streams in through our sensory
systems, it first stops off at our amygdalae, which are there to ask the
question, “Am I safe?” We feel safe in the world when enough of the
sensory stimulation coming in feels familiar.

When something does not feel familiar, however, our amygdalae tend to
label that unfamiliar thing as dangerous, and they respond by triggering our
fight-flight-or-play-dead fear response. If it has been your natural tendency
to fight, you probably rage, get big and loud, go on the attack or try to shoo
the thing away. If it is your style to run like the wind or play dead, then that
response may be your best choice.

When our amygdalae are triggered and we feel fear, we are not able to
run the learning and memory circuitry of our hippocampi. Until we push the
pause button and take a moment to calm down and feel safe again, we will
not be able to think clearly. This is why anyone who is freaking out with
test anxiety tends to perform poorly, regardless of how well prepared they
are. When our limbic anxiety circuit is triggered, we are neuroanatomically
cut off from accessing our higher cortical thinking centers, which is where
our learned knowledge is stored.

Understanding the anatomy of the brain is always insightful when it
comes to our experience and behavior. If we live with the basic belief that
there is only one group of cells inside of our brain that processes our
emotions, our experience of mixed emotions can be very confusing. At a
neuroanatomical level, when we experience conflicting feelings it is
because we have two emotional groups of cells that are completely separate
from one another in that they do not share any cell bodies.

Equally important, these two emotional modules of cells process
incoming information in predictably different ways. Providing we
understand that our left brain processes information linearly and in
sequence, we will see in detail how our left-brain emotional module is
designed to bring in information about the present moment and then
compare that to any emotional experience we have had in the past. As a
result, our left-brain emotional Character 2 is programmed to protect us
from anything that has a history of hurting us. Consequently, our Character
2 is primed to say “No” and push things away.

Our right-brain emotional Character 3 is exactly the opposite in that it
processes present-moment experiences in the present moment. Therefore
our emotional Character 3 always exists in the here and now and has no
recollection of the past. Instead of pushing things away, our Character 3
moves enthusiastically toward any experience that remotely smells like an
enticing and juicy adrenaline rush.

In the mammalian nervous system, a new species is often created by
adding new brain cells on top of a well-integrated preexisting cellular
matrix. When this happens, the new tissue is designed to refine and evolve
the abilities of the tissue below. In the case of the human brain, although we
share the cells of our deeper emotional limbic tissue with other mammals,
such as dogs and monkeys, what distinguishes our human brain as unique
are the newly added-on higher cortical cells of our two thinking brains.

When information from the external world streams in through our
sensory systems, it is processed first by the cells of our limbic emotional
cells before it is refined by our higher thinking centers. So, from a purely
biological perspective, we humans are feeling creatures who think, rather
than thinking creatures who feel. Neuroanatomically you and I are
programmed to feel our emotions, and any attempt we may make to bypass
or ignore what we are feeling may have the power to derail our mental
health at this most fundamental level.

From an evolutionary standpoint, our human brain exists as a truly
amazing neurological accomplishment, but it is critical to remember that we
are far from being a finished product. Instead humanity exists in an ongoing
state of evolution: First, we are actively integrating the newly added-on
tissue of our left thinking brain (Character 1) with the tissue of the

underlying left emotional brain (Character 2). Second, we are integrating
the newly added-on tissue of our right thinking brain (Character 4) with the
underlying tissue of our right emotional brain (Character 3). Third, we are
connecting the left emotional brain tissue (Character 2) with the right
emotional brain tissue (Character 3). And finally, we are integrating the left
thinking brain tissue (Character 1) with the right thinking brain tissue
(Character 4). When we accomplish this we will evolve into whole-brain
living.

Although our human brain is an evolving masterpiece in process, you
don’t have to look far to see how the differences between what our left and
right hemispheres value (which we will explore in detail in Chapter 3) are
playing out in our lives and in society. Besides the most obvious social
unrest imparted by our bipartisan political hostilities, statistically speaking,
one in five adults in the U.S. will be diagnosed with a severe mental illness
at some point in their life. Choosing to advance our own evolution as a
species will help us find peace individually, communally, and ultimately
globally.

As we move through this material, I implore you to open your heart and
mind and be completely honest with yourself about your own individual
strengths and weaknesses. As long as we live in a society that rewards us
for what we do, rather than for who we are, we will feel undervalued and
unfulfilled. For many of us, our goal has been to “get rid of” or “fix” the
most unruly, unattractive, or vulnerable parts of ourselves. But when we
choose to embrace, listen to, and nurture all of our characters, we will
mature, grow, and evolve into that person our dog already thinks we are.

Just to clarify, in this book we are talking about four predictable and easy
to identify characters that we all have, based on the anatomy of our brain.
Every ability we have is completely dependent on the underlying brain cells
that manufacture those abilities, and these four different groups of cells
manufacture four different skill sets, ultimately resulting in the expression
of each of our Four Characters. When many authors and teachers refer to
the _authentic self_, you may wonder which of these Four Characters they
might be referring to. In fact, from the way they describe the “authentic
self,” it is clear that they are referring to Character 4. But please understand
that none of the Four Characters is more authentic than the others. Each of
these characters represents an authentic part of who we are at a cellular
level and should be treated with dignity, respect, and honor.



### **A Note on Brain Disorders**

It is important to note that the material presented here is not
related to either schizophrenia or multiple personality disorder,
which are both serious neuropsychiatric disorders. The word
_schizophrenia_ by definition means “split brain,” but the division that
it describes is a break between the brain of a person and the
accepted norms of its surrounding society.

The necessary criteria for someone to be diagnosed with the brain
disorder schizophrenia is the experience of sensory hallucinations
supported by a delusional thinking system. If your brain is inputting
abnormal sensory perceptions of the world because you are seeing,
smelling, or hearing things that others are not experiencing, it is
impossible for your brain to use those building blocks to construct a
normal perception of the world. Predictably, your brain would create
a delusional thinking system matching the altered input. Not only do
the brains of people with schizophrenia process incoming data in
error from normal perception, but there are alterations in the internal
wiring of that information. As a result, the brain of a person with
schizophrenia is split from normal information processing at a
cellular level, and the resultant delusional thinking system is a byproduct of that brain’s abnormal neurological miswiring.

Multiple personality disorder (MPD) is a completely different
brain disorder from schizophrenia. There is a lot that is not known
about this disorder, including why or how a brain is capable of
manufacturing multiple personalities. Sometimes these personalities
don’t even know about one another, or they may exist in conflict.
MPD is a pathological condition that may be manifested as a coping
tool in response to childhood trauma. In the case of MPD, the split
in consciousness occurs within the brain, whereas in schizophrenia
the split occurs between the consciousness of the brain and its
perception of external reality.

After the stroke, once my whole brain came back online and all four of
my characters became fully functional again, I learned that I have the ability
to not only recognize which circuitry or character I am running but to
choose whether I want to continue running that circuit or switch to a
different one. This unusual journey has helped me understand that not only
I but all of us have incredible power concerning who and how we want to
be. My passion is for you to master your own Four Characters so you, too,
can completely own your power and live your best life.

In the following chapters we will explore the anatomy and psychology of
the brain’s two hemispheres and Four Characters in more detail. (Don’t
worry—I will make this as interesting and simple as I can.) From there we
will explore the unique skill sets that each of the Four Characters specialize
in and help you identify which character you are inhabiting at any moment
based on what they _feel_ like inside of your body.

Then, as we move farther into the book, not only will you meet and get to
know the Four Characters of your left and right _thinking_ Characters 1 and 4,
and your left and right _emotional_ Characters 2 and 3, but you will gain
insight into how these Four Characters can interact and work together on
your behalf.

When we know, understand, and nurture our own Four Characters, their
relationships with one another, and their collective power within us, we
promote our own cognitive, emotional, physical, and spiritual wellness.
This is whole-brain living. I truly believe that this is the evolutionary goal
of humanity, and we are getting there one brain at a time.





**CHAPTER 2**
