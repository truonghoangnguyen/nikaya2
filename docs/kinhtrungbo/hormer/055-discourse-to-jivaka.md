# 55. Discourse to Jīvaka

## Jīvaka Sutta

#### [368] [32]

 THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying at Rājagaha
 in Jīvaka Komārabhacca's[1] Mango Grove.

 Then Jīvaka Komāra- [33] bhacca approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 having greeted the Lord,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 Jīvaka Komārabhacca spoke thus to the Lord;

 "This is what I have heard, revered sir:
 that they kill living creatures on purpose for the recluse Gotama,
 and that the recluse Gotama knowingly makes use of meat
 killed on purpose
 and specially provided for him.

 Those who speak thus, revered sir:

 'They kill living creatures on purpose for the recluse Gotama,
 and the recluse Gotama knowingly makes use of meat
 killed on purpose
 and specially provided for him'
 now, are these quoting the Lord's own words, revered sir,
 not misrepresenting the Lord
 with what is not fact,
 are they explaining in conformity with dhamma,
 and does no reasoned thesis[2]
 give occasion for contempt?"[3]

 [369] "Jlvaka, those who speak thus:

 'They kill living creatures on purpose for the recluse Gotama,
 and the recluse Gotama knowingly makes use of meat
 killed on purpose
 and specially provided for him'
 these are not quoting my own words,
 but are misrepresenting me
 with what is not true,
 with what is not fact.

 I, Jīvaka, say
 that in three cases
 meat may not be used:

 if it is seen,
 heard,
 suspected
 (to have been killed on purpose for a monk).
 In these three cases I, Jīvaka, say
 that meat may not be used.

 But I, Jīvaka, say
 that in three cases
 meat may be used:

 if it is not seen,
 heard,
 suspected
 (to have been killed on purpose for a monk).[4]

 In these three cases I, Jīvaka, say
 that meat may be used.

 As to this, Jīvaka,
 a monk lives depending on a village
 or market town.[5]

 He dwells having suffused the first quarter
 with a mind of friendliness,
 likewise the second,
 likewise the third,
 likewise the fourth;
 just so above,
 below,
 across;
 he dwells having suffused the whole world everywhere,
 in every way,
 with a mind of friendliness
 that is far-reaching,
 wide-spread,
 immeasurable,
 without enmity,
 without malevolence.
 A householder
 or a householder's son,
 having approached him,
 invites him to a meal on the morrow.

 The monk accepts, Jīvaka,
 if he so desires.

 At the end of that night,
 having dressed in the early morning,
 taking his bowl and robe,
 he approaches [34] the dwelling of that householder
 or householder's son;
 having approached,
 he sits down on the appointed seat,
 and the householder
 or householder's son
 waits on him with sumptuous almsfood.

 It does not occur to him:

 'Indeed it is good
 that a householder
 or a householder's son
 waits on me with sumptuous almsfood.
