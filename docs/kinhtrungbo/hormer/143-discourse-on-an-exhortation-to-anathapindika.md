# 143. Discourse on an Exhortation to Anāthapiṇḍika

## Anāthapiṇḍik'ovāda Sutta

#### THUS HAVE I HEARD:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī
 in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 Now at that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was a sick man,
 in pain,
 grievously ill.

 And the householder Anāthapiṇḍika
 summoned a certain man and said to him:

 "Come you, my good man,
 approach the Lord;
 having approached,
 in my name salute the Lord's feet with your head
 and say to him:

 'Revered sir, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika is a sick man,
 in pain,
 grievously ill;
 he salutes the Lord's feet with his head.'

 And then approach the venerable Sāriputta;
 having approached,
 in my name salute the venerable Sāriputta's feet with your head
 and say to him:

 'Revered sir, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika is a sick man,
 in pain,
 grievously ill;
 he salutes the venerable Sāriputta's feet with his head.'

 And then say:

 'Indeed, it would be good, revered sir,
 if the venerable Sāriputta,
 out of compassion,
 would approach the dwelling of the householder Anāthapiṇḍika.'"

 When that man had answered the householder Anāthapiṇḍika in assent,
 saying,
 "Very well, reverend sir,"[1]
 he approached the Lord;
 having approached and greeted the Lord,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance
 that man spoke thus to the Lord:

 'Revered sir, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika is a sick man,
 in pain,
 grievously ill;
 he salutes the Lord's feet with his head.'

 And he then approached the venerable Sāriputta;
 having approached
 and greeted the venerable Sāriputta,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance
 that man spoke thus to the venerable Sāriputta:

 "Revered sir, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika is a sick man,
 in pain,
 grievously ill;
 he salutes the venerable Sāriputta's feet with his head
 and speaks to him thus:

 'Indeed, it would be good, revered sir,
 if the venerable Sāriputta,
 out of compassion,
 would approach the dwelling of the householder Anāthapiṇḍika.'"

 The venerable Sāriputta consented by becoming silent.

 Then [310] the venerable Sāriputta clothed himself and,
 taking his bowl and robe,
 approached the dwelling of the householder Anāthapiṇḍika
 with the venerable Ānanda as his attendant;
 having approached,
 he sat down on the appointed seat.

 As he was sitting down on the appointed seat
 the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika:

 "I hope that you, householder,
 are getting better,
 I hope you are keeping going,
 I hope the painful feelings are lessening,
 not increasing,
 that a lessening in them is apparent,
 not an increase?"

 "I am not getting better, revered Sāriputta,
 I am not keeping going;
 my painful feelings are increasing,
 not lessening;
 an increase in them is apparent,
 not a lessening.

 Revered Sāriputta[2]
 as a strong man
 might cleave one's head
 with a sharp-edged sword,
 even so, revered Sāriputta,
 do exceedingly loud winds rend my head.

 I am not better, revered Sāriputta,
 I am not keeping going;
 my grievously painful feelings are increasing,
 not lessening;
 an increase in them is apparent,
 not a lessening.

 As, revered Sāriputta, a strong man
 might clamp a turban on one's head
 with a tight leather strap,
 even so, revered Sāriputta,
 do I have very bad headaches.

 I am not better, revered Sāriputta,
 I am not keeping going;
 my grievously painful feelings are increasing,
 not lessening;
 an increase in them is apparent,
 not a lessening.

 As, revered Sāriputta,
 a skilled cattle-butcher
 or his apprentice
 might cut through the stomach
 with a sharp butcher's knife,
 even so, revered Sāriputta,
 do very strong winds cut through my stomach.

 I am not better, revered Sāriputta,
 I am not keeping going;
 my grievously painful feelings are increasing,
 not lessening;
 an increase in them is apparent,
 not a lessening.

 As, revered Sāriputta,
 two strong men,
 having taken hold of a weaker man by his limbs,
 might set fire to him,
 might make him sizzle up over a charcoal pit,
 even so, revered Sāriputta,
 there is a fierce heat in my body.

 I am not better, revered Sāriputta,
 I am not keeping going;
 my grievously painful feelings are increasing,
 not lessening;
 an increase in them is apparent,
 not a lessening.

 This is how you must train yourself, householder."
 When this had been said, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika
 cried and shed tears.

 Then the venerable Ānanda spoke thus
 to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika:

 "Householder, are you holding on
 or are you sinking, householder?"

 "I, revered Ānanda,
 am not holding on,
 I am sinking.[3]

 Although the Teacher
 and monks who were developing their minds[4] visited [313] me for a long time,
 I have never yet heard reasoned talk such as this."

 "Reasoned talk such as this, householder,
 does not (usually) occur
 for householders clad in white.[5]

 It is for those
 that have gone forth, householder,
 that reasoned talk such as this
 (usually) occurs."

 "Well then, revered Sāriputta,
 let there occur reasoned talk such as this
 for householders clad in white.

 There are, revered Sāriputta,
 young men of family
 with but little dust in their eyes
 who, not hearing dhamma,
 are declining,
 but they could be learners of dhamma"[6]
 And when the venerable Sāriputta
 and the venerable Ānanda
 had exhorted the householder Anāthapiṇḍika
 with this exhortation,
 they rose from their seats and departed.

 Soon after the venerable Sāriputta
 and the venerable Ānanda, had departed,
 the householder Anāthapiṇḍika
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 arose in the Tusita group (of devas).

 And when the night was far spent
 the young deva[7] Anāthapiṇḍika,
 having illumined the whole of the Jeta Grove
 with his radiant beauty,
 approached the Lord;[8]
 having approached and greeted the Lord,
 he stood at a respectful distance.

 As he was standing at a respectful distance,
 the young deva Anāthapiṇḍika
 addressed the Lord in verses:

 "This[9] friendly Jeta Grove frequented by the Order of seers,[10]
 Dwelt in by the King under dhamma, is the generator of my joy.

 [314] Deed,[11] knowledge,[12] and dhamma,[13] the highest moral life[14]  By these are mortals purified,[15] not by clan nor wealth.
 Accordingly the wise man, beholding his own goal,
 Seeking dhamma[16] judiciously, is thus purified therein.[17]
 As Sāriputta in wisdom, in morality and calm,[18]
 So let whatever monk has gone beyond be excellent in these."

 Thus spoke the young deva Anāthapiṇḍika.

 The Lord was approving.
 And the young deva Anāthapiṇḍika thought:

 "The Lord approves of me,"
 and having greeted the Lord,
 then and there he vanished
 keeping his right side towards him.

 Then the Lord
 towards the end of that night
 addressed the monks,
 saying:

 "Monks, when this night was far spent
 a certain young deva,
 having illumined the whole of the Jeta Grove
 with bis radiant beauty,
 approached me;
 having approached and greeted me,
 he stood at a respectful distance.

 As he was standing at a respectful distance,
 this young deva addressed me in verses:

 "This friendly Jeta Grove frequented by the Order of seers,
 Dwelt in by the King under dhamma, is the generator of my joy.
 Deed, knowledge, and dhamma, the highest moral life  By these are mortals purified, not by clan nor wealth.
 Accordingly the wise man, beholding his own goal,
 Seeking dhamma judiciously, is thus purified therein.
 As Sāriputta in wisdom, in morality and calm,
 So let whatever monk has gone beyond be excellent in these."

 Thus spoke that young deva, monks.

 Thinking,
 'The Lord approves of me,'
 and having greeted me,
 then and there he vanished
 keeping his right side towards me."

 When this had been said,
 the venerable Ānanda, spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Now, revered sir,
 could that have been the young deva Anāthapiṇḍika?

 Revered sir, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika
 had unwavering confidence in the venerable Sāriputta."

 [315] "It is good,
 it is good, Ānanda.

 All that could be obtained by reasoning, Ānanda,
 has been obtained by you.

 Ānanda, that young deva
 was Anāthapiṇḍika,
 no other."

 Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted, the venerable Ānanda rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
