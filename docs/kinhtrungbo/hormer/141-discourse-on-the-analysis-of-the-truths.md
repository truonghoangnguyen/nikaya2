# 141. Discourse on the Analysis of the Truths

## Sacca-Vibhaṅga Sutta

#### THUS HAVE I HEARD:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Benares
 in the deer-park
 at Isipatana.

 While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Monks."

 "Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "The matchless Wheel of dhamma
 set rolling by the Tathāāgata,
 the perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One
 in the deer-park at Isipatana
 near Benares
 cannot be rolled back
 by a recluse or brahman
 or deva
 or Māra
 or Brahmā
 or by anyone in the world.

 That is to say,
 it was a proclamation of the four ariyan truths,
 a teaching,
 laying down,
 establishing,
 opening up,
 analysing,
 and making of them plain.

 Of what four?

 It was a proclamation,
 a teaching,
 laying down,
 establishing,
 opening up,
 analysing
 and making plain
 of the ariyan truth of anguish.

 It was a proclamation,

 It was a proclamation,

 analysing
 and making plain
 of the ariyan truth of the course
 leading to the stopping of anguish.

 The matchless Wheel of dhamma} monks,
 set rolling by the Tathāāgata,
 the perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One
 in the deer-park at Isipatana
 near Benares
 cannot be rolled back
 by a recluse or brahman
 or deva
 or Māra
 or Brahmā
 or by anyone in the world.
 That is to say,
 it was a proclamation of the four ariyan truths,
 a teaching,
 laying down,
 establishing,
 opening up,
 analysing,
 and making of them plain.

 Monks, follow Sāriputta and Moggallāna; monks,
 associate with Sāriputta and Moggallāna;
 they are wise monks
 who are helpers[1] to Brahma-farers.

 Monks, like a mother,
 so is Sāriputta;
 like a child's foster-mother,
 so is Moggallāna.

 Sāriputta, monks,
 trains (one) in the fruit of stream-attainment,
 Moggallāna in the highest [296] goal.[2] Sāriputta, monks,
 is able to proclaim,
 teach,
 lay down,
 establish,
 open up,
 analyse
 and make plain
 the four ariyan truths in full."[3]

 Thus spoke the Lord;
 and having said this,
 the Well-farer rose from his seat
 and entered a dwelling-place.
 §

 Soon after the Lord had departed
 the venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks who were there,
 saying;

 "Reverend monks."

 "Your reverence,"
 these monks answered the venerable Sāriputta in assent.

 The venerable Sāriputta spoke thus:

 "Your reverences, the matchless Wheel of dhamma
 set rolling by the Tathāāgata,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One
 in the deer-park at Isipatana
 near Benares

 or deva

 or Brahmā
 or by anyone in the world.

 Your reverences, a wish like this arises

 As to this, your reverences,

 He fares along

 ■

 And what, your reverences,
 is right concentration?
 As to this, your reverences,
 a monk, aloof from the pleasures of the senses,
 aloof from unskilled states of mind,
 entering into the first meditation
 which is accompanied by initial thought
 and discursive thought,
 is born of aloofness,
 and is rapturous and joyful,
 abides in it.

 And again, your reverences, a monk,
 by allaying initial and discursive thought,
 his mind subjectively tranquillised
 and fixed on one point,
 enters on
 and abides in
 the second meditation
 which is devoid of initial and discursive thought,
 is born of concentration
 and is rapturous and joyful.

 And again, your reverences, a monk,
 by the fading out of rapture,
 dwells with equanimity,
 attentive and clearly conscious,
 and experiences in his person
 that joy of which the ariyans say:
 'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,'
 and he enters on
 and abides in
 the third meditation.

 And again, your reverences, a monk
 by getting rid of joy,
 by getting rid of anguish,
 by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows,
 enters on
 and abides in
 the fourth meditation
 which has neither anguish nor joy,
 and which is entirely purified
 by equanimity and mindfulness.

 This, your reverences, is called
 right concentration.

 This, your reverences, is called
 the ariyan truth of the course leading to the stopping of anguish.

 Your reverences, the matchless Wheel of dhamma
 set rolling by the Tathāāgata,
 the perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One
 in the deer-park at Isipatana
 near Benares
 cannot be rolled back
 by a recluse or brahman
 or deva
 or Māra
 or Brahmā
 or by anyone in the world.

 That is to say,
 it was a proclamation
 a teaching,
 laying down,
 establishing,
 opening up,
 analysing,
 and making plain
 of these four ariyan truths."
 Thus spoke the venerable Sāriputta.

 Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the venerable Sāriputta had said.
