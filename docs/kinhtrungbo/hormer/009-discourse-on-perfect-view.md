# 9. Discourse on Perfect View

## Sammā Diṭṭhi Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī
 in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 There the venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks,
 saying:

 "Monks."

 "Your reverence,"
 these monks answered the venerable Sāriputta in assent.

 Then the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus:

 "Your reverences, it is said:
 'Perfect view,[2]
 perfect view.'

 To what extent indeed, your reverences,
 does a disciple of the ariyans
 come to be of perfect view,
 one whose view is upright,
 one who is possessed of unwavering confidence in dhamma,
 who is come into this true dhamma?"

 "From afar, your reverence,
 would we come into the venerable Sāriputta's presence
 to learn the meaning of this utterance.

 It were good if the meaning of this utterance
 were to be made clear by[3] the venerable Sāriputta himself;
 the monks, having heard it from the venerable Sāriputta,
 will bear it in mind."

 [58] "Very well, your reverences,
 listen
 and attend carefully
 and I will speak."

 "Yes, your reverence,"
 these monks answered the venerable Sāriputta in assent.

 The venerable Sāriputta spoke thus:

 "When a disciple of the ariyans
 comprehends unskill
 and un-skill's root,
 and comprehends skill
 and skill's root,
 to this extent, your reverences,
 does a disciple of the ariyans
 come to be of perfect view,
 one whose view is upright,
 who is possessed of unwavering confidence in dhamma,
 one who has come into this true dhamma.

 And what, your reverences, is unskill?

 What is unskill's root?

 What is skill?

 What is skill's root?

 Onslaught on creatures, your reverences, is unskill,
 taking what is not given is unskill,
 sexual misconduct is unskill,
 lying speech is unskill,
 slanderous speech is unskill,
 harsh speech is unskill,
 gossip is unskill,
 covetise is unskill,
 wrath is unskill,
 wrong view is unskill.

 This, your reverences, is called unskill.

 And what, your reverences, is unskill's root?

 Greed is unskill's root,
 hatred is unskill's root,
 confusion is unskill's root.

 This, your reverences, is called unskill's root.

 And what, your reverences, is skill?

 Restraint from onslaught on creatures is skill,
 restraint from taking what is not given is skill,
 restraint from sexual misconduct is skill,
 restraint from lying speech is skill,
 restraint from slanderous speech is skill,
 restraint from harsh speech is skill,
 restraint from gossip is skill,
 non-covetise is skill,
 non-wrath is skill,
 perfect view is skill.

 This, your reverences, is called skill.

 And what, your reverences, is skill's root?

 Non-greed is skill's root,
 non-hatred is skill's root,
 non-confusion is skill's root.

 This, your reverences, is called skill's root.

 When, your reverences, a disciple of the ariyans
 comprehends unskill thus,
 comprehends unskill's root thus,
 comprehends skill thus,
 comprehends skill's root thus,
 he, having got rid of all addiction to attachment,[4]
 having dispelled addiction to shunning,[4]
 having abolished addiction to the latent view 'I am,'
 having got rid of ignorance,
 having made knowledge arise,
 is here-now an end-maker of anguish.

 To this extent, your reverences,
 does a disciple of the ariyans
 come to be of perfect view,
 one whose view is upright,
 one who is possessed of unwavering confidence in dhamma,
 one who has come into this true dhamma."

 ■

 [59] Saying:

 "Good, your reverence,"
 these monks, having rejoiced in what the venerable Sāriputta had said,
 having approved of it,
 asked the venerable Sāriputta a further question:

 "Might there be, your reverence,
 also another method
 by which a disciple of the ariyans
 comes to be of perfect view,
 one whose view is upright,
 one who has unwavering confidence in dhamma,
 one who has come into this true dhamma?"

 "There might be, your reverences.

 When, your reverences, a disciple of the ariyans
 comprehends sustenance[5]
 and comprehends the uprising of sustenance
 and comprehends the stopping of sustenance
 and comprehends the course leading to the stopping of sustenance,
 to this extent also, your reverences,
 does a disciple of the ariyans
 come to be of perfect view,
 one whose view is upright,
 one who has unwavering confidence in dhamma,
 one who has come into this true dhamma.

 And what, your reverences, is sustenance?

 What is the uprising of sustenance?
 What is the stopping of sustenance?

 What is the course leading to the stopping of sustenance?

 Your reverences, there are these four[6] (kinds of) sustenance
 for the stability of creatures
 who have come to be
 or for the assistance of those
 who are seeking to be.

 What are the four?

 Material food, coarse or fine;
 (sense-) impingement is the second;
 volition is the third;
 consciousness[7] is the fourth.

 From the uprising of craving
 is the uprising of sustenance,
 from the stopping of craving
 is the stopping of sustenance;
 the course leading to the stopping of sustenance
 is this ariyan eightfold Way itself,
 that is to say:
 perfect view,
 perfect thought,
 perfect speech,
 perfect action,
 perfect way of living,
 perfect endeavour,
 perfect mindfulness,
 perfect concentration.

 When a disciple of the ariyans

 comprehends the course leading to the stopping of sustenance thus,
 he, having got rid of all addiction to attachment,

 To this extent, also, your reverences,

 come [60] to be of perfect view,
 one whose view is upright,
 one who is possessed of unwavering confidence in dhamma,
 one who has come into this true dhamma."

 Birth is anguish,

 and if one does not get what one wants,

 This, your reverences, is called anguish.
 And what, your reverences, is the uprising of anguish?

 That craving which is
 connected with again-becoming,
 accompanied by delight and attachment,
 finding delight in this and that,
 namely the craving for sense-pleasures,

 the craving for annihilation[10]  this, your reverences, is called the origin of anguish.

 And what, your reverences, is the stopping of anguish?

 Whatever is the stopping,
 with no attachment remaining,
 of that selfsame craving,
 the giving up of it,
 the renunciation of it,
 the release from it,
 the doing away with it  this, your reverences, is called the stopping of anguish.

 And what, your reverences, is the course leading to the stopping of anguish?
