# 101. Discourse at Devadaha

## Devadaha Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying among the Sakyans.

 A market town of the Sakyans was called Devadaha.[1]

 While he was there
 the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Monks."

 "Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "There are, monks, some recluses and brahmans who speak thus
 and are of these views:
 'Whatever this individual experiences,
 whether pleasant
 or painful
 or neither painful nor pleasant,
 all is due to what was previously done.

 Thus by burning up,[2]
 by making and end
 of ancient deeds,
 by the non-doing of new deeds,
 there is no overflowing into the future.

 From there being no overflowing into the future
 comes the destruction of deeds;
 from the destruction of deeds
 comes the destruction of anguish;
 from the destruction of anguish
 comes the destruction of feeling;
 from the destruction of feeling
 all anguish will become worn away.'

 Jains speak thus, monks.

 I, monks, speak thus-having approached Jains,
 I speak thus:

 'Is it true, as is said, reverend Jains,
 that you speak thus
 and are of these views:

 'Whatever this individual experiences,
 whether pleasant
 or painful
 or neither painful nor pleasant,
 all is due to what was previously done.
 Thus by burning up,
 by making and end
 of ancient deeds,
 by the non-doing of new deeds,
 there is no overflowing into the future.

 From there being no overflowing into the future
 comes the destruction of deeds;
 from the destruction of deeds
 comes the destruction of anguish;
 from the destruction of anguish
 comes the destruction of feeling;
 from the destruction of feeling
 all anguish will become worn away.'?

 If, monks, these Jains
 on being asked this by me
 acknowledge it,
 saying 'Yes',
 then I speak thus:

 'But do you, reverend Jains, know[2]
 that you yourselves were in the past,
 that you were not not?'

 'Not this, your reverence.'

 'But do you, reverend Jains, know
 that you yourselves did this evil deed in the past,
 that you did not not do it?'

 'Not this, your reverence.'

 'But do you, reverend Jains, know
 that you did not do an evil deed like this
 or like that?'
 'Not this, your reverence.'

 'But do you, reverend Jains, know
 that so much anguish is worn [4] away,
 or that so much anguish is to be worn away,
 or that when so much anguish is worn away,
 all anguish will become worn away?'

 'Not this, your reverence.'

 'But do you, reverend Jains, know
 the getting rid of unskilled states of mind
 here and now,
 the arising of skilled states?'

 'Not this, your reverence.'

 'From what you say, reverend Jains,
 you do not know whether you yourselves were in the past,
 or whether you were not not;
 you do not know whether in the past
 you yourselves did this evil deed,
 or whether you did not not do it;
 you do not know whether you did an evil deed
 like this or like that;
 you do not know that so much anguish is worn away,
 or that so much anguish is to be worn away,
 or that when so much anguish is worn away,
 all anguish will become worn away;
 you do not know the getting rid
 of unskilled states of mind here and now,
 or the arising of skilled states.

 This being so,
 it would not be suitable
 that the reverend Jains should explain,
 saying:
 'Whatever this individual experiences,
 whether pleasant
 or painful
 or neither painful nor pleasant,
 all is due to what was previously done.

 Thus by burning up,
 by making and end
 of ancient deeds,
 by the non-doing of new deeds,
 there is no overflowing into the future.

 From there being no overflowing into the future
 comes the destruction of deeds;
 from the destruction of deeds
 comes the destruction of anguish;
 from the destruction of anguish
 comes the destruction of feeling;
 from the destruction of feeling
 all anguish will become worn away.'

 But if you, reverend Jains, were to know:

 "We ourselves were in the past,
 we were not not";
 if you were to know:
 "We ourselves did this evil deed in the past,
 we did not not do it";
 if you were to know:
 "We did not do an evil deed like this or like that";
 if you were to know:
 "So much anguish is worn away,
 or so much anguish is to be worn away,
 or when so much anguish is worn away,
 all anguish will become worn away";
 if you were to know
 the getting rid of unskilled states of mind
 here and now,
 or the arising of skilled ones  this being so,
 it would be suitable
 that the reverend Jains should explain,
 saying:

 'Whatever this individual experiences,
 whether pleasant
 or painful
 or neither painful nor pleasant,
 all is due to what was previously done.

 Thus by burning up,
 by making and end
 of ancient deeds,
 by the non-doing of new deeds,
 there is no overflowing into the future.

 From there being no overflowing into the future
 comes the destruction of deeds;
 from the destruction of deeds
 comes the destruction of anguish;
 from the destruction of anguish
 comes the destruction of feeling;
 from the destruction of feeling
 all anguish will become worn away.'

 Reverend Jains,
 it is as if a man were pierced by an arrow
 that was thickly smeared with poison.[3]

 And because he has felt the arrow
 he might experience a feeling
 that was painful,
 severe,
 sharp.

 His [5] friends and acquaintances,
 kith and kin
 might procure a physician and surgeon.

 That physician and surgeon
 might cut round the opening of his wound with a knife,
 but on account of cutting round the opening of the wound with the knife
 the man might experience a feeling that was painful,
 severe,
 sharp.

 That physician and surgeon
 might probe him for the arrow
 with a (surgeon's) probe,[4]
 but on account of his being probed for the arrow
 with the (surgeon's) probe
 he might also experience a feeling that was painful,
 severe,
 sharp.

 That physician and surgeon
 might extract the arrow from him,
 but on account of having the arrow extracted
 he might also experience a feeling that was painful,
 severe,
 sharp.

 The physician and surgeon
 might dress the opening of his wound
 with medicated powder,[5]
 but on account of having the opening of the wound
 dressed with medicated powder
 he might also experience a feeling that was painful,
 severe,
 sharp.

 After a time
 when the skin had healed on the wound
 he would be well,
 at ease,
 independent,
 his own master,
 going wherever he liked.[6]

 This might occur to him:

 "Once upon a time I was pierced by an arrow
 that was thickly smeared with poison.

 And because I felt the arrow
 I experienced a feeling that was painful,
 severe,
 sharp.

 My friends and acquaintances,
 kith and kin
 procured a physician and surgeon.

 That physician and surgeon
 cut round the opening of my wound with a knife,
 but on account of cutting round the opening of the wound with the knife
 I experienced a feeling that was painful,
 severe,
 sharp.

 That physician and surgeon
 probed me for the arrow
 with a (surgeon's) probe,
 but on account of my being probed for the arrow
 with the (surgeon's) probe
 I experienced a feeling that was painful,
 severe,
 sharp.

 That physician and surgeon
 extracted the arrow from me,
 but on account of having the arrow extracted
 I experienced a feeling that was painful,
 severe,
 sharp.

 The physician and surgeon
 dressed the opening of my wound
 with medicated powder,
 but on account of having the opening of the wound
 dressed with medicated powder
 I experienced a feeling that was painful,
 severe,
 sharp.

 But now that the skin has healed on the wound
 I am well,
 at ease,
 independent,
 my own master,
 going wherever I like.

 Even so, reverend Jains,
 if you were to know:

 "We ourselves were in the past,
 we were not not";
 if you were to know:
 "We ourselves did this evil deed in the past,
 we did not not do it";
 if you were to know:
 "We did not do an evil deed like this or like that";
 if you were to know:
 "So much anguish is worn away,
 or so much anguish is to be worn away,
 or when so much anguish is worn away,
 all anguish will become worn away";
 if you were to know
 the getting rid of unskilled states of mind
 here and now,
 or the arising of skilled ones  this being so,
 it would be suitable
 that the reverend Jains should explain,
 saying:

 'Whatever this individual experiences,
 whether pleasant
 or painful
 or neither painful nor pleasant,
 all is due to what was previously done.

 Thus by burning up,
 by making and end
 of ancient deeds,
 by the non-doing of new deeds,
 there is no overflowing into the future.

 From there being no overflowing into the future
 comes the destruction of deeds;
 from the destruction of deeds
 comes the destruction of anguish;
 from the destruction of anguish
 comes the destruction of feeling;
 from the destruction of feeling
 all anguish will become worn away.'
 'But as you, reverend Jains, do not know:

 "We ourselves were in the past,
 we were not not";
 if you were to know:
 "We ourselves did this evil deed in the past,
 we did not not do it";
 if you were to know:
 "We did not do [6] an evil deed like this or like that";
 if you were to know:
 "So much anguish is worn away,
 or so much anguish is to be worn away,
 or when so much anguish is worn away,
 all anguish will become worn away";
 if you were to know
 the getting rid of unskilled states of mind
 here and now,
 or the arising of skilled ones  therefore it would not be suitable
 that the reverend Jains should explain,
 saying:

 'Whatever this individual experiences,
 whether pleasant
 or painful
 or neither painful nor pleasant,
 all is due to what was previously done.

 Thus by burning up,
 by making and end
 of ancient deeds,
 by the non-doing of new deeds,
 there is no overflowing into the future.

 From there being no overflowing into the future
 comes the destruction of deeds;
 from the destruction of deeds
 comes the destruction of anguish;
 from the destruction of anguish
 comes the destruction of feeling;
 from the destruction of feeling
 all anguish will become worn away.'

 When this had been said, monks,
 these Jains spoke to me thus:

 'Your reverence, Nāṭaputta the Jain
 is all-knowing,
 all-seeing;[7]
 he claims all-embracing knowledge-and-vision,
 saying:

 "Whether I am walking
 or standing still
 or asleep
 or awake,
 knowledge-and-vision is permanently
 and continuously before me."

 He speaks thus:

 "If there is, reverend Jains,
 an evil deed that was formerly done by you,
 wear it away by this severe austerity.

 That which is the non-doing
 of an evil deed in the future
 is from control of body,
 control of speech,
 control of thought
 here, now.
 Thus by burning up,
 by making an end
 of ancient deeds,
 by the non-doing of new deeds,
 there is no overflowing into the future.

 From there being no overflowing into the future
 comes the destruction of deeds;
 from the destruction of deeds
 comes the destruction of anguish;
 from the destruction of anguish
 comes the destruction of feeling;
 from the destruction of feeling
 all anguish will become worn away."

 And because that is approved of by us
 as well as being pleasing to us,
 therefore we are delighted.'

 When this had been said
 I, monks, spoke thus to those Jains:

 'These five conditions here-now, reverend Jains,
 have a twofold result.

 What five?

 Faith,
 inclination,
 tradition,
 consideration of reasons,
 reflection on and approval of some view.[8]

 These, reverend Jains,
 are five conditions here-now
 that have a twofold result.
 As to this,
 what was the faith
 that in the past
 the reverend Jains had in a teacher,
 what was their inclination,
 what the tradition,
 what the [7] consideration of reasons,
 what the reflection on
 and approval of some view?'

 I, monks, speaking thus,
 beheld no reasoned response[9]
 among the Jains.

 And again, monks, I spoke to these Jains thus:

 What do you think about this, reverend Jains?

 At a time when there is severe effort for you,
 severe striving,
 do you at that time
 experience a feeling that is severe,
 acute,
 painful,
 severe,
 sharp?

 But at a time when there is no severe effort for you,
 no severe striving,
 do you at that time
 experience a feeling that is not severe
 acute,
 painful,
 severe,
 sharp?'

 ■

 'Reverend Gotama, at a time when there is severe effort for us
 severe striving,
 at that time
 we experience a feeling that is severe,
 acute,
 painful,
 severe,
 sharp.

 But at a time when there is no severe effort for us,
 no severe striving,
 at that time we do not experience a feeling
 that is severe,
 acute,
 painful,
 severe,
 sharp.

 'So really it is, reverend Jains:

 At a time when there is severe effort for you,
 severe striving,
 you at that time
 experience a feeling that is severe,
 acute,
 painful,
 severe,
 sharp.

 But at a time when there is no severe effort for you,
 no severe striving,
 you at that time
 you do not experience a feeling
 that is severe
 acute,
 painful,
 severe,
 sharp.'

 This being so,
 it would be suitable
 that the reverend Jains should explain,
 saying:

 'Whatever this individual experiences,
 whether pleasant
 or painful
 or neither painful nor pleasant,
 all is due to what was previously done.

 Thus by burning up,
 by making and end
 of ancient deeds,
 by the non-doing of new deeds,
 there is no overflowing into the future.

 From there being no overflowing into the future
 comes the destruction of deeds;
 from the destruction of deeds
 comes the destruction of anguish;
 from the destruction of anguish
 comes the destruction of feeling;
 from the destruction of feeling
 all anguish will become worn away.'

 ■
 If, reverend Jains, at a time
 when there is severe effort for you,
 severe striving,
 at that very time
 there might be a feeling that is acute,
 painful,
 severe,
 sharp;
 but at the time
 when there is no severe effort for you,
 no severe striving,
 at that very time
 there might (also) be a feeling that is acute,
 painful,
 severe,
 sharp —
 this being so,
 it would be suitable that the reverend Jains should explain,
 saying:

 'Whatever this individual experiences,
 whether pleasant
 or painful
 or neither painful nor pleasant,
 all is due to what was previously done.

 Thus by burning up,
 by making and end
 of ancient deeds,
 by the non-doing of new deeds,
 there is no overflowing into the future.

 From there being no overflowing into the future
 comes the destruction of deeds;
 from the destruction of deeds
 comes the destruction of anguish;
 from the destruction of anguish
 comes the destruction of feeling;
 from the destruction of feeling
 all anguish will become worn away.'

 ■

 But inasmuch reverend Jains,
 as at a time
 when there is severe effort for you:
 severe striving,
 at that time
 you experience a feeling that is severe
 acute,
 painful,
 severe,
 sharp;
 but at a time
 when there is no severe effort for you,
 no severe striving,
 at that time
 you do not experience a feeling that is severe,
 acute,
 painful,
 severe
 sharp  then it is precisely you yourselves
 who, while experiencing a feeling that is severe
 acute,
 painful,
 severe,
 sharp,
 are deceived by ignorance,
 nescience,
 confusion,
 saying:
 'Whatever this individual experiences,

 [8] whether pleasant
 or painful
 or neither painful nor pleasant,
 all is due to what was previously done.

 Thus by burning up,
 by making and end
 of ancient deeds,
 by the non-doing of new deeds,
 there is no overflowing into the future.

 From there being no overflowing into the future
 comes the destruction of deeds;
 from the destruction of deeds
 comes the destruction of anguish;
 from the destruction of anguish
 comes the destruction of feeling;
 from the destruction of feeling
 all anguish will become worn away.'

 Again, monks, I, speaking thus,
 beheld no reasoned response among the Jains.

 And again, monks, I spoke to these Jains thus:

 'What do you think about this, reverend Jains?

 Is it possible to say:

 "Let that deed[10]
 which is to be experienced here and now
 be, through effort or striving,
 one to be experienced in a future state (instead)[11]"?'

 'Not this, your reverence.'

 'Is it possible to say:

 "Let that deed
 which is to be experienced in a future state
 be, through effort or striving,
 one to be experienced here and now (instead)"?'

 'Not this, your reverence.'

 'What do you think about this, reverend Jains?

 Is it possible to say:

 "Let that deed
 which is to be experienced as pleasant
 be, through effort or striving,
 one to be experienced as painful?"'

 'Not this, your reverence.'

 'But is it possible to say:

 "Let that deed
 which is to be experienced as painful
 be, through effort or striving,
 one to be experienced as pleasant?"'

 'Not this, your reverence.'

 'What do you think about this, reverend Jains?

 Is it possible to say:
 "Let that deed
 which is to be experienced as thoroughly ripened[12]
 be, through effort or striving,
 one to be experienced as not thoroughly ripened?"'[13]

 [9] 'Not this, your reverence.'

 'But is it possible to say:

 "Let that deed
 which is to be experienced as not thoroughly ripened
 be, through striving or effort,
 one to be experienced as thoroughly ripened"?'

 'Not this, your reverence.'

 'What do you think about this, reverend Jains?

 Is it possible to say:

 "Let that deed which is to be much experienced
 be, through effort or striving,
 to be little experienced"?'

 'Not this, your reverence.'

 'But is it possible to say:

 "Let that deed
 which is to be little experienced
 be, through effort or striving,
 one to be much experienced"?'

 'Not this, your reverence.'

 'What do you think about this, reverend Jains?

 Is it possible to say:
 "Let that deed which is to be experienced[14]
 be, through effort or striving,
 one not to be experienced"?'

 'Not this, your reverence.'

 'But is it possible to say:

 "Let that deed which is not to be experienced
 be, through effort or striving,
 one to be experienced"?'

 'Not this, your reverence.'

 'So really it is, reverend Jains:

 It is not possible to say:

 "Let that deed
 which is to be experienced here and now
 be, through effort or striving,
 one to be experienced in a future state (instead);

 Let that deed
 which is to be experienced in a future state
 be, through effort or striving,
 one to be experienced here and now (instead);

 Let that deed
 which is to be experienced as pleasant
 be, through effort or striving,
 one to be experienced as painful;

 Let that deed
 which is to be experienced as painful
 be, through effort or striving,
 one to be experienced as pleasant;
 Let that deed
 which is to be experienced as thoroughly ripened
 be, through effort or striving,
 one to be experienced as not thoroughly ripened;

 Let that deed
 which is to be experienced as not thoroughly ripened
 be, through striving or effort,
 one to be experienced as thoroughly ripened;

 Let that deed which is to be much experienced
 be, through effort or striving,
 to be little experienced;

 Let that deed
 which is to be little experienced
 be, through effort or striving,
 one to be much experienced;

 Let that deed which is to be experienced
 be, through effort or striving,
 one not to be experienced;

 Let that deed which is not to be experienced
 be, through effort or striving,
 one to be experienced;

 This being so,
 the effort of the reverend Jains
 is fruitless,
 their striving fruitless.'

 Monks, Jains speak thus;
 monks, the ten reasoned theses of the Jains
 who speak thus
 give occasion for contempt.[15]
 [10] If, monks, the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 are due to what was previously done;[16]
 certainly, monks, the Jains
 were formerly doers of deeds
 that were badly done
 in that they now experience such painful,
 severe,
 sharp feelings.

 If, monks, the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 are due to creation by an overlord,[16]
 certainly, monks, the Jains
 were created by an evil overlord
 in that they now experience such painful,
 severe,
 sharp feelings.

 If, monks, the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 are due to necessary conditions.[17]
 certainly, monks, the Jains
 are evil of necessity
 in that they now experience such painful,
 severe,
 sharp feelings.

 If, monks, the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 are due to the species[18] (to which they belong),
 certainly, monks, the Jains
 are of an evil species
 in that they now experience such painful,
 severe,
 sharp feelings.

 If, monks, the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 are due to effort here and now,
 certainly, monks, the Jains
 are of evil effort here and now
 in that they now experience such painful,
 severe,
 sharp feelings.

 If, monks, the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 are due to what was previously done,
 the Jains arc contemptible;
 and if the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 is not due to what was previously done
 the Jains are contemptible.

 If, monks, the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo are due to an overlord,
 the Jains arc contemptible;
 and if the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 is not due to an overlord
 the Jains are contemptible.

 If, monks, the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo are due to necessary conditions,
 the Jains arc contemptible;
 and if the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 is not due to necessary conditions
 the Jains are contemptible.

 If, monks, the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo are due to the species (to which they belong),
 the Jains arc contemptible;
 and if the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 is not due to the species (to which they belong)
 the Jains are contemptible.

 If, monks, the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo are due to effort here and now,
 the Jains arc contemptible;
 and if the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 is not due to effort here and now
 the Jains are contemptible.

 Monks, Jains speak thus;
 monks, these ten reasoned theses of the Jains
 who speak thus
 give occasion for contempt.

 Even so, monks, is fruitless effort,
 fruitless striving.

 And how, monks,
 is effort fruitful,
 striving fruitful?
 Herein, monks,
 a monk does not let his unmastered self
 be mastered by anguish,
 and he does not cast out rightful happiness
 and is undefiled [11] by[19] that happiness.

 He comprehends thus:

 'While I am striving against the aggregate[20]
 of this source of anguish,[21]
 from striving against the aggregate
 there is detachment for me.

 But while I am indifferent
 to that source of anguish,
 through (my) developing equanimity
 there is detachment for me.'

 While (a monk) is striving
 against the aggregate
 of this source of anguish,
 from striving against the aggregate
 there is detachment for him  accordingly[22] he strives against the aggregate;
 but while he is indifferent
 to that source of anguish,
 through (his) developing equanimity
 there is detachment for him  accordingly he develops equanimity.

 While he is striving
 against the aggregate
 of that source of anguish,
 from striving against the aggregate
 there is detachment (for him).
 Even so is that anguish worn away for him.

 While he is indifferent to that[23] source of anguish,
 through (his) developing equanimity
 there is detachment for him.

 Even so is that anguish
 also worn away for him.

 Monks, it is like a man,
 passionately in love with a woman
 his desire acute,
 his longing acute.

 He might see that woman
 standing and talking,
 joking and laughing
 with another man.

 What do you think about this, monks?

 Would it not be
 that grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair
 did not rise up in that man
 when he saw that woman
 standing and talking,
 joking and laughing
 with another man?"

 "Yes, revered sir.

 What is the reason for this?
 It is that that man
 is passionately in love with that woman,
 his desire acute,
 his longing acute.

 Therefore, seeing that woman
 standing and talking,
 joking and laughing
 with another man,
 grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair
 rise up (in him)."

 "But then, monks,
 that man might think thus:

 'I am passionately in love with this woman,
 my desire acute,
 my longing acute;
 grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair
 rise up in me
 when I see this woman
 standing and talking,
 joking and laughing
 with another man.

 Suppose I were to get rid of
 my desire and attachment
 for that woman?'
 So he may get rid of
 his desire and attachment
 for that woman.

 After a time
 he may see that woman
 standing and talking,
 joking and laughing
 with another [12] man.

 What do you think about this, monks?

 Would it be
 that grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair
 rose up in that man
 on seeing that woman
 standing and talking,
 joking and laughing
 with another man?"

 "No, revered sir.

 What is the reason for this?

 It is, revered sir, that this man
 is (now) without passion for this woman.

 Therefore on seeing that woman
 standing and talking,
 joking and laughing
 with another man,
 grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering
 lamentation
 and despair
 do not rise up (in him)."

 "Even so, monks,
 one does not let his unmastered self
 be mastered by anguish and he does not cast out rightful happiness
 and is undefiled by that happiness.

 He comprehends thus:

 'While I am striving against the aggregate
 of this source of anguish,
 from striving against the aggregate
 there is detachment for me.

 But while I am indifferent
 to that source of anguish,
 through (my) developing equanimity
 there is detachment for me.'

 While (a monk) is striving
 against the aggregate
 of this source of anguish,
 from striving against the aggregate
 there is detachment for him  accordingly he strives against the aggregate;
 but while he is indifferent
 to that source of anguish,
 through (his) developing equanimity
 there is detachment for him  accordingly he develops equanimity.

 While he is striving
 against the aggregate
 of that source of anguish,
 from striving against the aggregate
 there is detachment (for him).

 Even so is that anguish worn away for him.

 While he is indifferent to that source of anguish,
 through (his) developing equanimity
 there is detachment for him.

 Even so is that anguish
 also worn away for him.

 Thus, monks, is effort fruitful,
 is striving fruitful.

 And again, monks, a monk reflects thus:

 'Dwelling as I please,
 unskilled states grow much,
 skilled states decline'
 but while striving against my self
 through anguish[24]
 unskilled states decline,
 skilled states grow much.

 Suppose I were to strive against self
 through anguisll?'

 He strives against self through anguish;
 striving against self through anguish
 his unskilled states decline,
 skilled states grow much.

 After a time
 he does not strive against self
 through anguish.
 What is the reason for this?

 Monks, the purposes[25] of that monk
 who might strive against self
 through anguish
 is accomplished,
 therefore after a time
 he docs not strive against self
 through anguish.

 Monks, it is like a fletcher
 who heats and scorches
 a shaft
 between two fire-brands
 to make it straight
 and serviceable.

 But when, monks, the fletcher's
 shaft
 has been heated
 and scorched
 between the two fire-brands
 and made straight
 and serviceable,
 he no longer heats
 and scorches
 the shaft
 between the two fire-brands
 to make it straight
 and serviceable.

 What is the reason for this?

 Monks, the purpose
 for which the fletcher might heat and scorch the shaft
 between the two fire-brands
 to make it straight and serviceable
 is accomplished;
 therefore he no longer heats and scorches it
 between the two fire-brands
 to make it straight and serviceable.

 Even so, monks, a monk reflects thus:

 'Dwelling as I please,
 unskilled states grow much,
 skilled states decline'
 but while striving against my self
 through anguish
 unskilled states decline,
 skilled states grow much.

 Suppose I were to strive against self
 through anguish?'

 He strives against self through anguish;
 striving against self through anguish
 his unskilled states decline,
 skilled states grow much.

 After a time
 he does not strive against self
 through anguish.

 What is the reason for this?

 Monks, the purposes of that monk
 might [13]strive against self
 through anguish
 is accomplished,
 therefore after a time
 he docs not strive against self
 through anguish.
 So too, monks, is effort fruitful,
 is striving fruitful.

 And again, monks, a Tathāgata arises in the world,
 a perfected one,
 a fully Self-awakened one
 endowed with right knowledge and conduct,
 well-farer,
 knower of the worlds,
 the matchless charioteer of men to be tamed,
 the Awakened One,
 the Lord.

 He makes known this world
 with the devas,
 with Māra,
 with Brahmā,
 creation
 with its recluses and brahmans,
 its devas and men,
 having realised them by his own super-knowledge.

 He teaches dhamma which is lovely at the beginning,
 lovely in the middle,
 lovely at the ending,
 with the spirit and the letter;
 he proclaims the Brahma-faring
 wholly fulfilled,
 quite purified.

 A householder
 or a householder's son
 or one born in another family
 hears that dhamma.
 Having heard that dhamma,
 he gains faith in the Tathāgata.

 Endowed with this faith
 that he has acquired,
 he reflects in this way:

 'The household life is confined and dusty;
 going forth is of the open;
 it is not easy for one who lives in a house
 to fare the Brahma-faring
 wholly fulfilled,
 wholly pure,
 polished like a conch-shell.

 Suppose now that I,
 having cut off hair and beard,
 having put on saffron robes,
 should go forth from home
 into homelessness?'

 After a time,
 getting rid of his wealth,
 be it small or great,
 getting rid of his circle of relations,
 be it small or great,
 having cut off his hair and beard,
 having put on saffron robes,
 he goes forth from home
 into homelessness.

 He, being thus one who has gone forth
 and who is endowed with the training
 and the way of living of monks,
 abandoning onslaught on creatures,
 is one who abstains from onslaught on creatures;
 the stick laid aside,
 the knife laid aside,
 he lives kindly,
 scrupulous,
 friendly
 and compassionate
 towards all breathing things and creatures.

 he is one who is chaste,
 keeping remote (from unchastity),

 Abandoning lying speech,
 he is one who abstains from lying speech,
 a truth-speaker,
 a bondsman to truth,

 dependable,

 Abandoning slanderous speech,
 he is one who abstains from slanderous speech;
 having heard something here
 he is not one for repeating it elsewhere
 for (causing) variance among these (people),
 or having heard something elsewhere
 he is not one to repeat it there
 for (causing) variance among these (people).
 In this way
 he is a reconciler of those who are at variance,
 and one who combines those who are friends.

 Concord is his pleasure,
 concord his delight,
 concord his joy,
 concord is the motive of his speech.

 Abandoning harsh speech,
 he is one who abstains from harsh speech.

 Whatever speech is gentle,
 pleasing to the ear,
 affectionate,
 going to the heart,
 urbane,
 pleasant to the manyfolk,
 agreeable to the manyfolk  he comes to be one who utters speech like this.

 Abandoning frivolous chatter,
 he is one who abstains from frivolous chatter.

 He is a speaker at a right time,
 a speaker of fact,
 a speaker on the goal,
 a speaker on dhamma,

 with similes at a right time
 that are discriminating,
 connected with the goal.

 As a bird on the wing
 wherever it flies
 takes its' wings with it as it flies,
 so a monk,
 contented with the robes for protecting his body,
 with the almsfood for sustaining his stomach,
 wherever he goes
 takes these things with him as he goes.

 He, possessed of the ariyan body of moral habit,
 subjectively experiences unsullied well-being.

 Having seen a material shape with the eye,
 he is not entranced by the general appearance,
 he is not entranced by the detail.

 If he dwells with this organ of sight uncontrolled,
 covetousness and dejection,
 evil unskilled states of mind,
 might predominate.

 So he fares along controlling it;
 he guards the organ of sight,
 he comes to control over the organ of sight.

 Having heard a sound with the ear,
 he is not entranced by the general appearance,
 he is not entranced by the detail.

 he is not entranced by the general appearance,

 evil unskilled states of mind,
 might predominate.

 So he fares along controlling it;
 he guards the organ of smell,
 he comes to control over the organ of smell.

 Having savoured a taste with the tongue,
 he is not entranced by the general appearance,
 he is not entranced by the detail.

 If he dwells with this organ of taste uncontrolled,
 covetousness and dejection,
 evil unskilled states of mind,
 might predominate.

 So he fares along controlling it;

 Having felt a touch with the body,
 he is not entranced by the general appearance,

 covetousness and dejection,
 evil unskilled states of mind,
 might predominate.

 Having cognised a mental object with the mind,
 he is not entranced by the general appearance,
 he is not entranced by the detail.

 If he lives with this organ of mind uncontrolled,
 covetousness and dejection,
 evil unskilled states of mind
 might predominate.

 So he fares along controlling it;
 he guards the organ of mind,
 he comes to control over the organ of mind.

 If he is possessed of this ariyan control of the (sense-) organs,
 he subjectively experiences unsullied well-being.

 Whether he is setting out
 or returning,
 he is one who comports himself properly;
 whether he is looking down
 or looking round,
 he is one who comports himself properly;
 whether he is bending back
 or stretching out (his arm),
 he is one who comports himself properly;
 whether he is carrying his outer cloak,
 his bowl,
 his robe,
 he is one who comports himself properly;
 whether he is munching,
 drinking,
 eating,
 savouring,

 whether he is obeying the calls of nature,
 he is one who comports himself properly;
 whether he is walking,
 standing,
 asleep,
 awake,
 talking,
 silent,
 he is one who comports himself properly.

 Possessed of this ariyan body of moral habit
 and possessed of this ariyan control of the (sense-) organs
 and possessed of this ariyan mindfulness
 and clear consciousness,
 he chooses a remote lodging in a forest,
 at the root of a tree,
 on a mountain slope,
 in a wilderness,
 in a hill-cave,
 in a cemetery,
 in a forest haunt,
 in the open
 or on a heap of straw.

 He, returning from alms-gathering
 after his meal,
 sits down cross-legged
 holding the back erect,
 having made mindfulness
 rise up in front of him.

 He, having got rid of covetousness for the world,
 lives with a mind devoid of coveting,
 he purifies the mind of coveting.
 By getting rid of the taint of ill-will,
 he lives benevolent in mind;
 and compassionate for the welfare
 of all creatures and beings,
 he purifies the mind of the taint of ill-will.

 By getting rid of sloth and torpor,
 he lives devoid of sloth and torpor;
 perceiving the light,
 mindful and clearly conscious,
 he purifies the mind of sloth and torpor.

 By getting rid of restlessness and worry,
 he lives calmly,
 the mind subjectively tranquillised,
 he purifies the mind of restlessness and worry.

 By getting rid of doubt,
 he lives doubt-crossed;
 unperplexed as to the states that are skilled,
 he purifies his mind of doubt.

 He, by getting rid of these five hindrances  defilements of a mind and weakening to intuitive wisdom  aloof from pleasure of the senses,
 aloof from unskilled states of mind,
 enters and abides in the first meditation,
 which is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought,
 is born of aloofness
 and is rapturous and joyful.

 Thus too, monks, is effort fruitful,
 striving fruitful.

 And again, monks, a monk,
 by allaying initial and discursive thought,
 his mind subjectively tranquillised
 and fixed on one point,
 enters on
 and abides in
 the second meditation
 which is devoid of initial and discursive thought,
 is born of concentration
 and is rapturous and joyful.

 Thus too, monks, is effort fruitful,
 striving fruitful.

 And again, monks, a monk,
 by the fading out of rapture,
 dwells with equanimity,
 attentive and clearly conscious,
 and experiences in his person
 that joy of which the ariyans say:
 'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,'
 and he enters on
 and abides in
 the third meditation.

 Thus too, monks, is effort fruitful,
 striving fruitful.

 And again, monks, a monk
 by getting rid of joy,
 by getting rid of anguish,
 by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows,
 enters on
 and abides in
 the fourth meditation
 which has neither anguish nor joy,
 and which is entirely purified
 by equanimity and mindfulness.
 Thus too, monks, is effort fruitful,
 striving fruitful.

 Thus with the mind composed,
 quite purified,
 quite clarified,
 without blemish,
 without defilement,
 grown soft and workable,
 stable,
 immovable,
 he directs his mind
 to the knowledge and recollection of former habitations.

 He recollects a variety of former habitations, thus:

 One birth,
 two births,
 three births,
 four births,
 five births,
 ten births,
 twenty births,
 thirty births,
 forty births,
 fifty births,
 a hundred births,
 a thousand births,
 a hundred thousand births,
 and many an eon of integration
 and many an eon of disintegration
 and many an eon of integration-disintegration:

 'Such a one was I by name,
 having such and such a clan,
 such and such a colour,
 so I was nourished,
 such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,
 so did the span of life end.

 Passing from this,
 I came to be in another state
 where I was such a one by name,
 having such and such a clan,
 such and such a colour,
 so I was nourished,
 such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,
 so did the span of life end.

 Passing from this,
 I arose here.'

 Thus he recollects divers former habitations
 in all their modes and detail.

 Thus too, monks, is effort fruitful,
 striving fruitful.

 ■

 With the mind composed thus,
 quite purified,
 quite clarified,
 without blemish,
 without defilement,
 grown soft and workable,
 stable,
 immovable,
 he directs his mind
 to the knowledge of the passing hence
 and the arising of beings.
 With the purified deva-vision
 surpassing that of men,
 he sees beings as they pass hence
 or come to be;
 he comprehends that beings are mean,
 excellent,
 comely,
 ugly,
 well-going,
 ill-going,
 according to the consequences of deeds,
 and thinks:

 'Indeed these worthy beings
 who were possessed of wrong conduct in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 scoffers at the ariyans,
 holding a wrong view,
 incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view  these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 have arisen in a sorrowful state,
 a bad bourn,
 the abyss,
 Niraya Hell.

 But these worthy beings
 who were possessed of good conduct in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 who did not scoff at the ariyans,
 holding a right view,
 incurring deeds consequent on a right view  these at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 have arisen in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.'
 Thus with the purified deva-vision
 surpassing that of men
 does he see beings as they pass hence,
 as they arise;
 he comprehends that beings are mean,
 excellent,
 comely,
 ugly,
 well-going,
 ill-going
 according to the consequences of deeds.

 Thus too, monks, is effort fruitful,
 striving fruitful.

 ■

 With the mind composed thus,
 quite purified,
 quite clarified,
 without blemish,
 without defilement,
 grown soft and workable,
 stable,
 immovable,
 he directs his mind
 to the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers.

 He comprehends as it really is:

 'This is anguish',
 'this is the arising of anguish',
 'this is the stopping of anguish',
 'this is the course leading to the stopping of anguish'.

 He comprehends as it really is:
 'These are the cankers',
 'this is the arising of the cankers',
 'this is the stopping of the cankers',
 'this is the course leading to the stopping of the cankers'.

 Knowing thus,
 seeing thus,
 his mind is freed from the canker of sense-pleasures
 and his mind is freed from the canker of becoming
 and his mind is freed from the canker of ignorance.

 In freedom the knowledge comes to be:

 'I am freed';
 and he comprehends:

 'Destroyed is birth,
 brought to a close the Brahma-faring,
 done is what was to be done,
 there is no [14] more of being such or so.'

 Thus too, monks, is effort fruitful,
 striving fruitful.

 The Tathāāgata speaks thus, monks;
 ten reasoned theses of a Tathāāgata who speaks thus, monks,
 give occasion for praise[26]:

 If, monks, the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 are due to what was previously done,
 certainly, monks, the Tathāāgata
 was formerly a doer of deeds that were well done
 in that he now experiences
 such cankerless pleasant feelings;
 If, monks, the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 are due to creation by an overlord,
 certainly, monks, the Tathāāgata
 was created by an auspicious overlord
 in that he now experiences
 such cankerless pleasant feelings;

 If, monks, the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 are due to necessary conditions,
 certainly, monks, the Tathāāgata
 is lovely of necessity
 in that he now experiences
 such cankerless pleasant feelings.

 If, monks, the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 are due to the species (to which they belong),
 certainly, monks, the Tathāāgata
 is of a lovely species
 in that he now experiences
 such cankerless pleasant feelings.

 If, monks, the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 are due to effort here and now,
 certainly, monks, the Tathāāgata
 is of lovely effort here and now
 in that he now experiences
 such cankerless pleasant feelings.

 ■

 If, monks, the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 are due to what was previously done,
 the Tathāāgata
 is praiseworthy;
 and if the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 is not due to what was previously done,
 the Tathāāgata is praiseworthy.

 If, monks, the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 are due to creation by an overlord,
 the Tathāāgata
 is praiseworthy;
 and if the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 is not due to creation by an overlord,
 the Tathāāgata is praiseworthy.

 If, monks, the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 are due to necessary conditions,
 the Tathāāgata
 is praiseworthy;
 and if the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 is not due to necessary conditions,
 the Tathāāgata is praiseworthy.

 If, monks, the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 are due to the species (to which they belong),
 the Tathāāgata
 is praiseworthy;
 and if the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 is not due to the species (to which they belong),
 the Tathāāgata is praiseworthy.

 If, monks, the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 are due to effort here and now,
 the Tathāāgata
 is praiseworthy;
 and if the pleasure and pain
 which creatures undergo
 is not due to effort here and now,
 the Tathāāgata is praiseworthy.

 Monks, the Tathāāgata speaks thus;
 monks, these ten reasoned theses
 of the Tathāāgata who speaks thus
 give occasion for praise."

 Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
