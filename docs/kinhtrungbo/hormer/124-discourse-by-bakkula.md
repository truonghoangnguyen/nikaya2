#### THUS HAVE I HEARD:

 in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels' feeding place.

 who had formerly been a friend of the venerable Bakkula
 when he was a householder,
 approached the venerable Bakkula;
 having approached
 and exchanged greetings of courtesy and friendliness
 with the venerable Bakkula
 be sat down at a respectful distance.

 As Kassapa the Unclothed was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 he spoke thus to the venerable Bakkula:
 "How long is it since you, reverend Bakkula, went forth?"

 "It must be eighty years, friend,
 since I went forth."

 "And how many times during these eighty years
 have you, reverend Bakkula,
 indulged in sexual intercourse?"

 Not long after he had been ordained,
 living alone,
 aloof,
 diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute,
 the venerable Kassapa having soon attained here and now [174] through his own super-knowledge
 that incomparable goal of the Brahma-faring
 for the sake of which young men of family
 rightly go forth from home into homelessness,
 entering on it,
 abided in it.

 And he knew:

 "Destroyed is birth,
 brought to a close the Brahma-faring,
 done is what was to be done,
 there is no more of being such or so."
 And the venerable Kassapa was one of the perfected ones.

 and going from dwelling-place to dwelling-place,
 spoke thus:

 "Let the venerable ones come forward,
 let the venerable ones come forward,
 today I will attain final nibbƒÅna."[28] ["Inasmuch as the venerable Bakkula took his key

 as he was sitting in the midst of the Order of monks,[29]
 attained final nibbƒÅna. ["Inasmuch as that the venerable Bakkula,
