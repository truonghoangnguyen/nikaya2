# 4. Discourse on Fear and Dread

## Bhayabhera Sutta

#### [21]

 THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 Then Jaṇussoṇi the brahman[1] approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 he exchanged greetings with the Lord;
 having exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.[2]

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, Jāṇussoṇi the brahman spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Good[3] Gotama,
 these who are sons of respectable families,[4]
 who [22] have gone forth from home into homelessness
 out of faith in the honoured Gotama,
 of these the honoured Gotama is the leader,
 to these the honoured Gotama is of great service,
 of these the honoured Gotama is the adviser,[5] and these people emulate the views of the honoured Gotama."

 "That is so, brahman, that is so, brahman.

 These who are sons of respectable families,
 who have gone forth from home into homelessness
 out of faith in me,
 of these I am the leader,
 to these I am of great service,
 of these I am the adviser.

 And these people emulate my views."

 "But, good Gotama,
 remote lodgings in forest[6]
 and in woodland wildernesses[6]
 are hard to put up with,
 arduous is aloofness,
 it is difficult to delight in solitude;
 methinks forests distract the mind
 of a monk who does not secure concentration."

 [17] "That is so, brahman, that is so, brahman.

 Remote lodgings in forest
 and in woodland wildernesses
 are hard to put up with
 arduous is aloofness,
 it is difficult to delight in solitude;
 methinks forests distract the mind
 of a monk who does not secure concentration."
 Brahman, before my Awakening,
 and while I was yet merely the Bodhisatta,
 not a fully self-awakened one,
 it occurred to me also:

 Remote lodgings in forest
 and in woodland wildernesses
 are hard to put up with
 arduous is aloofness,
 it is difficult to delight in solitude;
 methinks forests distract the mind
 of a monk who does not secure concentration."

 In connection with this
 it occurred to me, brahman:

 Whatever recluses or brahmans,
 not wholly pure in bodily actions,
 frequent remote lodgings in forest and woodland wildernesses,
 these worthy recluses and brahmans,
 because they are not wholly pure in bodily actions,
 indeed evoke (in themselves) unskilled[7] fear and dread.

 But I, not of impure bodily actions,
 frequent remote lodgings
 in forest and woodland wildernesses.

 I am wholly pure in bodily actions,
 I am one of those ariyans who,
 wholly pure in bodily actions,
 frequent remote lodgings
 in forest and woodland wildernesses.

 I, brahman, beholding in myself
 this complete purity of bodily actions,
 gained greater assurance[8] for living in the forest.

 I, brahman,
 beholding in myself this doubt crossed over,

 [19] gained greater assurance for living in the forest.

 these worthy recluses and brahmans,
 because they are terrified, affrighted,

 Of few desires am I,

 who frequent remote lodgings
 in forest and woodland wildernesses.
 I, brahman, beholding in myself
 this ['fewness of desires'?][ed1]
 gained greater assurance for living in the forest.

 ■

 In connection with this, brahman

 these worthy recluses and brahmans,
 because they are lethargic and lacking in energy,

 these worthy recluses and brahmans,
 because they are of muddled mindfulness,

 who frequent remote lodgings
 in forest and woodland wildernesses.

 I, brahman, beholding in myself

 ■

 In connection with this, brahman,
 it occurred to me:

 frequent remote lodgings
 in forest and woodland wildernesses,
 these worthy recluses and brahmans,
 because they are not composed,
 because their minds are wavering,

 frequent remote lodgings
 in forest and woodland wildernesses.

 I, brahman, beholding in myself
 this possession of concentration,

 ■

 In connection with this, brahman, it occurred to me:

 Whatever recluses or brahmans, weak in intuitive wisdom,[15] drivellers,[16]

 [26] frequent remote lodgings
 in forest and woodland wildernesses,
 these worthy recluses and brahmans,
 because they are weak in intuitive wisdom,
 drivellers,
 indeed evoke (in themselves)
 unskilled fear and dread.
 Not weak in intuitive wisdom,
 not a driveller
 do I frequent remote lodgings
 in forest and woodland wildernesses.

 Possessed of intuitive wisdom am I,
 I am one of those ariyans who,
 possessed of intuitive wisdom,
 frequent remote lodgings
 in forest and woodland wildernesses.

 I, brahman, beholding in myself
 this possession of intuitive wisdom,
 gained greater assurance for living in the forest.

 In connection with this, brahman,
 it occurred to me:

 Suppose that I,
 on those recognised and fixed nights:
 the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth
 of the half-months,[17] should stay in such frightening
 and horrifying lodgings
 as park-shrines,[18] forest-shrines,[19]
 tree-shrines,[20]
 so that I should see that fear and dread.

 So I, brahman, after a time,
 on those recognised and fixed nights,
 the fourteenth, the fifteenth and the eighth
 of the half-months,
 stayed in such frightening
 and horrifying places
 as park-shrines,
 forest-shrines,
 tree-shrines.

 As I was staying there, brahman,
 either an animal came along,
 or a peacock[21] [21] broke off a twig,
 or the wind rustled the fallen leaves.

 It occurred to me:

 Surely this is that fear and dread coming.

 Then it occurred to me, brahman:

 Why am I staying longing for nothing but fear?

 Suppose now that I,
 in whatever posture I may be
 as that fear and dread come upon me
 should, while in that same posture,
 drive out that fear and dread?

 If, brahman,
 that fear and dread came upon me
 while I was pacing up and down,
 I, brahman,
 neither stood still
 nor sat down
 nor lay down,
 but drove out [27] that fear and dread
 as I was pacing up and down.

 While I was standing, brahman,
 that fear and dread came upon me.
 So I, brahman,
 neither paced up and down
 nor sat down
 nor lay down
 until I had,
 while I was standing,
 driven out that fear and dread.

 While I was sitting down, brahman,
 that fear and dread came upon me.

 So I, brahman,
 neither lay down
 nor stood up
 nor paced up and down
 until, while I was sitting down,
 I drove out that fear and dread.

 While I was lying down, brahman,
 that fear and dread came upon me.

 So I, brahman,
 neither sat down
 nor stood up
 nor paced up and down
 until I had,
 while I was lying down,
 driven out that fear and dread.

 Now there are, brahman,
 some recluses and brahmans
 who suppose that night is similar to day
 and who suppose that day is similar to night.

 Of these recluses and brahmans
 I say that they are living in bewilderment.

 For I, brahman,
 suppose that night is similar to night,
 I suppose that day is similar to day.

 Whoever, brahman,
 in speaking aright should say:

 'A being not liable to bewilderment
 has arisen in the world
 for the welfare of the many-folk,
 for the happiness of the manyfolk,
 out of compassion for the world,
 for the good,
 the welfare,
 the happiness of devas and men,
 then, in speaking aright of me
 he would say:
 'A being not liable to bewilderment
 has arisen in the world
 for the welfare of the many-folk,
 for the happiness of the manyfolk,
 out of compassion for the world,
 for the good,
 the welfare,
 the happiness of devas and men.'[22]

 Unsluggish energy is stirred up by me, brahman,
 unmuddled mindfulness is raised up,
 my body is tranquil,
 impassible,
 my mind composed,
 one-pointed.

 So I, brahman,
 aloof from pleasures of the senses,
 aloof from unskilled states of mind,
 entered into the first meditation[23]
 which is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought, is born of aloofness,
 and is rapturous and joyful.

 By allaying initial and discursive thought,
 with the mind subjectively tranquillised
 and fixed on one point,

 [22] I entered into and abided in the second meditation
 which is devoid of initial and discursive thought,
 is born of concentration,
 and is rapturous and joyful.

 By the fading out of rapture,
 I dwelt with equanimity,
 attentive,
 and clearly conscious;
 and I experienced in my person
 that joy of which the ariyans say:

 'Joyful lives he
 who has equanimity and is mindful,'

 and I entered into and abided in the third meditation.

 [28] By getting rid of joy,
 by getting rid of anguish,
 by the going down
 of my former pleasures and sorrows,
 I entered into and abided in
 the fourth meditation
 which has neither anguish nor joy,
 and which is entirely purified
 by equanimity and mindfulness.

 Thus with the mind composed,
 quite purified,
 quite clarified,
 without blemish,
 without defilement,
 grown soft and workable,
 fixed,
 immovable,
 I directed my mind
 to the knowledge and recollection
 of former habitations[24]:

 I remembered a variety of former habitations, thus:
 one birth,
 two births,
 three births,
 four births,
 five births,
 ten births,
 twenty births,
 thirty births,
 forty births,
 fifty births,
 a hundred births,
 a thousand births,
 a hundred thousand births,
 and many an eon of integration
 and many an eon of disintegration
 and many an eon of integration-disintegration;
 such a one was I by name,
 having such and such a clan,
 such and such a colour,
 so was I nourished,
 such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,
 so did the span of life end.

 Passing from this,
 I came to be in another state[25]
 where such a one was I by name,
 having such and such a clan,
 such and such a colour,
 so was I nourished,
 such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,
 so did the span of life end.

 Passing from this,
 I arose here.[26]

 Thus I remember divers former habitations
 in all their modes and detail.

 This, brahman,
 was the first knowledge attained by me
 in the first watch of the night;
 ignorance was dispelled,
 knowledge arose,
 darkness was dispelled,
 light arose,
 even as I abided diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute.

 Then with the mind composed,
 quite purified,
 quite clarified,
 without blemish,
 without defilement,
 grown soft and workable,
 fixed,
 immovable,
 I directed my mind
 to the knowledge of the passing hence
 and the arising of beings.

 With the purified deva-vision
 surpassing that of men
 I see beings as they pass hence
 or come to be;
 I comprehend that beings are mean,
 excellent,
 comely,
 ugly,
 well-going,
 ill-going,
 according to the consequences of their deeds,
 and I think:

 Indeed these worthy beings
 who were possessed of wrong conduct in body,
 who were possessed of wrong conduct of [29] speech,
 who were possessed of wrong conduct of thought,
 scoffers at the ariyans,
 holding a wrong view,
 incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view  these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 have arisen in a sorrowful state,
 a bad bourn,
 the abyss,
 Niraya Hell.

 But these worthy beings
 who were possessed of good conduct in body,

 [23] who were possessed of good conduct in speech,
 who were possessed of good conduct in thought,
 who did not scoff at the ariyans,
 holding a right view,
 incurring deeds consequent on a right view  these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 have arisen in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.

 Thus with the purified deva-vision
 surpassing that of men
 do I see beings as they pass hence,
 as they arise;
 I comprehend that beings are mean,
 excellent,
 comely,
 ugly,
 well-going,
 ill-going
 according to the consequences of their deeds.

 This, brahman,
 was the second knowledge attained by me
 in the middle watch of the night;
 ignorance was dispelled,
 knowledge arose,
 darkness was dispelled,
 light arose,
 even as I abided diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute.

 Then with the mind composed
 quite purified,
 quite clarified,
 without blemish,
 without defilement,
 grown soft and workable,
 fixed,
 immovable,
 I directed my mind
 to the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers.

 I understood as it really is:

 This is anguish,
 this is the arising of anguish,
 this is the stopping of anguish,
 this is the course leading to the stopping of anguish.

 I understood as it really is:

 These are the cankers,
 this is the arising of the cankers,
 this is the stopping of the cankers,
 this is the course leading to the stopping of the cankers.

 Knowing this thus,
 seeing thus,
 my mind was freed
 from the canker of sense-pleasures,
 and my mind was freed
 from the canker of becoming,
 and my mind was freed
 from the canker of ignorance.[27]

 In freedom
 the knowledge came to be:

 I am freed;

 and I comprehended:
 Destroyed is birth,
 brought to a close is the Brahma-faring,
 done is what was to be done,
 there is no more of being such or such.[28]

 This, brahman,
 was the third knowledge attained by me
 in the last watch of the night;
 ignorance was dispelled,
 knowledge arose,
 darkness was dispelled,
 light arose
 even as I abided diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute.

 [30] But it may be, brahman, that this occurs to you:

 'Is the recluse Gotama
 even today
 not devoid of attachment,
 not devoid of aversion,
 not devoid of confusion,
 and that therefore
 he frequents remote lodgings
 in forest and woodland wildernesses?

 But this is not to be taken in this way, brahman.

 I frequent[29] remote lodgings
 in forest and woodland wildernesses, brahman,
 beholding two special reasons:
 beholding for the self[30]
 an abiding in ease here and now,[31]
 and being compassionate
 for the folk that come after.[32]"
 "The folk that come after
 have the compassion of the revered Gotama

 [24] because of his perfection,
 because of his complete self-awakening.

 Excellent, good Gotama,
 excellent, good Gotama.

 It is as if one might set upright
 what had been upset,
 or might disclose what was covered,
 or show the way to one who had gone astray,
 or bring an oil-lamp into the darkness
 so that those with vision might see material shapes  even so
 in many a figure
 has dhamma been made clear
 by the revered Gotama.

 Thus I am going to the revered Gotama for refuge,
 to dhamma
 and to the Order of monks.

 May the revered Gotama accept me as a layfollower
 going for refuge
 from today forth
 for as long as life lasts."
